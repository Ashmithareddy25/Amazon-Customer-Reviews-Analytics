B00004TWZF|4.0|Besson made a very innovative , mesmerizing and overwhelming movie . This story begins with a tragedy which will sign the path of two brothers .<br />The sea as the perpetuum mobile , as the goddes to conquer every time you drown and remains in its inner , playing with it and seducing it , revealing its misteries and sublime beauty .<br />You will probably engage with this original and challenging proposal .<br />All the cast is superb . Reno and Mac Barr . And consider the intensity of acting given by Mac Barr that he was the starring of Zentropa , two years later as the candor northamerican citizen .<br />Reno is today one of the top versatile actors in the world and Arquette was very credible with her role .<br />Captivating and intriguing film from start to end .
B000002NIW|5.0|This is a must-have when I bought it at HMV Downtown Edmonton.  It was a male cashier.  He said he loved them.  Check out the first track that starts this album and you'll have headbangin good time trust me!
B000002TYX|5.0|Contains the amazing, heartbreaking \\"Free As A Bird\\" that shows the Beatles still had the magic thirty years after they'd broken up! What a finally crafted song! An immaculate production, also, seeing how they started with Lennon's crappy home demo and sculpted it into perfection. What a great way to top off the Beatles career! <br /> <br />But that is the only new song here, and it's the only song with sterling production qualities. The other songs are demos and out-takes and historical recordings. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO START IF YOU ARE NEW TO THE BEATLES (Instead, buy Rubber Soul, Revolver, or Abbey Road). <br /> <br />However, if you have already explored the Beatles \\"real\\" recordings, the stuff they actually CHOSE to release, and you want to know where the Beatles started and how they grew into the monsters they became, this collection will set you straight. I love it! (Even though it is the weakest of the three anthologies.) <br /> <br />REMEMBER: These anthologies are NOT \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections. They aren't even the final versions of the songs that the Beatles released on their real albums. The anthologies are OUT-TAKES and historical recordings of interest to serious Beatles devotees. Don't make the same mistake my dumb girl-friend made -- she wanted to find out what the Beatles were like and so she went out an bought a Beatles album -- this one! WRONG!
B00028HBKC|1.0|No \\"Passion\\" here.  <br /> <br />\\"Gore\\", beyond definition, is here. <br /> <br />2/3 of the film are of the sadistic graphic beating of a man, who would have expired far beyond the efforts of the discusting, drunken Roman guards. <br /> <br />English subtitles only. <br /> <br />Short film. Poor character development. Must watch several times to pin down Jesus. <br /> <br />As a Christian, I'm insulted.  <br /> <br />Mysterious flash backs abound.  <br /> <br />Has all the ambiance of a low budget art film. <br /> <br />Confused as to the assumed and adopted threat to Jews. It's more of a threat to Christians, and an assault on the gullibility of any audience.  <br /> <br />Just another drive-by attack, buy a greedy film maker. <br /> <br />Save your money. Please! <br /> <br />I wish it hadn't been like this.  <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|Roger Ebert wrote in his review of this film that it is more transcending than uplifting.  I cannot agree more.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Critics who give the filmed masterpiece \\"Star Wars\\" a negative review must not have a strong background in film. Have these members of the bourgeois seen Kurosawa's \\"The Hidden Fortress\\"?  Are they aware of the Classic Flash Gordon serials? Do they think a black comedy is any film that stars Eddie Murphy? Are they lost in translation when they are at the box office of their local multiplex. Are the techno-geeks too phat from playing their Matrix video games for ten thousand hours. <br /> <br />The dialog in Star Wars was purposfuly juvenile and adds to the charm of the pictures. It's no \\"Godfather\\" and was never ment to be.  <br /> <br />There is no converting the unconverted. I only pity them. Life is too short not to have fun while watching movies. An example follows: I respect \\"Schindler's List\\" and I consider it the greatest picture ever made. I've seen it only once, an emotional experience I will never forget. I've seen \\"Star Wars\\" and its two original sequels houndreds of times. As for the SE versions, I understand what Lucas is trying to do by creating six films that progress and flow in a coherent fashion. <br /> <br />All Star Wars fans, and fans of great cinema must stand together against the \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"Friends,\\" \\"American Beauty,\\" reality TV loving zombies. Star Wars was a small art-house, independent picture that just happened to be very popular. It was never meant to have the success it achieved. It was not designed to be a blockbuster. It became a blockbuster because it is great. Worlds were created which never existed before. This visual spectacle is something to be treasured for generations.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001ZMWQO|1.0|I made a name just so I could review this piece of garbage. <br /> <br />This whole style of calling everything \\"Indie-Rock\\" when it is being shown on MTV is totally contradicting itself.  Obviously when one record company picked up an artist from the \\"Independent\\" scene, the rest follow in suit.  Unfortunatly for the world It was a horrible band by the name of \\"The Strokes\\" who everyone things is so \\"Innovative, underground\\" that it makes one want to vomit just hearing it. <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is just a rip-off of anything that looms in the underground world of music that is good. <br /> <br />If you want \\"Dance-Rock\\" listen to The Faint, or Q And Not U.  Not this over-produced work of some fat ceo of a mainstream rec. label who \\"Discovered\\" (AKA created) it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|To anyone who hasn't heard by now, George Lucas has really gone to town on destroying this DVD.  He has super-imposed Hayden Christenson's body into ROTJ at the end, when Luke see's the three ghosts, he has gotten rid of Obi-wan's howl that scares away the sand people in ANH and replaced it with something that sounds like a car alarm, he has changed dialogue in ESB so it seems that Darth Vader didn't know he had a son, also in ESB he has taken out the creepy hologram image of the Emporer and replaced it with that of Ian McDeirmont, the actor who plays the emporer in episodes one and two.  These are just some of the changes, not to mention dialogue that was changed and clipped.  Show Lucas that WE WANT THE ORIGINALS!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!
B000002OX7|4.0|Lets face it, it's difficult to pick an album by The Who that isn't  special. That said, \\"Who's Next\\" is really up there with the top two or three. A polished, original, \\"true\\" Who product. <br />Having bought the vinyl when it was first released, the CD sound quality is brilliant. <br />So why not 5 stars?  Well, the bonus tracks could have easily been left off and few of us would have missed them. <br />But also, try to get hold of Pete Townshend's \\"Who came first\\"....some absolute brilliance on this cd. <br />Enjoy!
B00004Y6O4|3.0|Some folks out there are enamored with this CD and the big disco smash Do Ya Think I'm Sexy.  others may think old hot Rod expanded his style.  To some degree Rod Stewart did do the later.  However, Blondes Have More Fun is just an ordianry ten song set.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these songs do not ofend me in any great way.  They just do not thrill me.  The prevous release, Foot Loose and Fancy Free consisted of edgy rock tunes and touching ballads.  There are too many ho hum ballads with lifeless arrangements.  The rockers are a little better but fall short of previous gems like Hot Legs and Born Loose.  Dirty Weekend may have catchy guitars but the hooks and lyrics are somewhat forgettable.  The title track is pretty catchy but does not break any ground in the creative department.  Is That The Thanks I Get has a pretty catchy chorus and the cover of Standing In The Shadows Of Love is quite memorable. The disco hit Do Ya Think I'm Sexy has a few catchy moments but just does not stay to memorable over its five minute length.  I could go on about the other five songs but the response would be the same:  Some good moments but basically forgettable.<br /><br />Therefore unless you are an established fan of Hot Rod, I would say that you could live without this recording.

B00005JKES|5.0|All I can say is Season 2 must be released as soon as possible to capture this year's holiday shopping. Because if done there will be  major record sales of this fantastic, riviting program for both Seasons 1 AND 2... Twin Peaks ROCKS!!
6304711905|5.0|I have always hated westerns, but I absolutely love this movie! The cast is incredible, and there's lots of excitement throughout!  Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are amazing in their roles as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.  This movie is loaded with testosterone, but I think ladies will enjoy this one (I know I do!!!).
B0001NBMBC|1.0|If you are a fan of Iowa and the self titled album  DO NOT BUY THE NEW ALBUM! This is slipknot turned into a top forty version of Stone sour. This album is slow and full of ballads. True fans of the old slipknot and heavy metal will hate this album.  Slipknot sold out big and this album really sucks. I hope this album finishes the band and Corey can back to writing love songs for Spider-man movies.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I wouldn't have minded if Lucas had released both versions. I think it would have been great, but just releasing the new Special Edition on DVD is not a sensible thing to do, not even a smart move. What's to say about the original versions? Well, actually nothing! Those are now part of human legacy and not only should, but must be preserved as the masterpieces they are from the first day human race were introduced to the Star Wars. About the Special Edition released on DVD, first I think the DVD should clearly state in big letters that it is the Special Edition, and secondly, it wouldn't have been that bad if Lucas had limited himself to clean up the movie, fix some errors, and probably even add some special effects, but what's been done is outrageous. I mean to put Jabba the Hutt there in A New Hope is the worse mistake of all, not only does it look just plain ridiculous, but it doesn't really add anything valuable to the story. I think some of the new scenes and special effects are pretty good, and they really improve the movie to some extent, but some others are just offensive. Bottom line: The original Star Wars trilogy must be released not only for the fans, but for historical reasons; the Special Edition should, at least, strip Jabba the Hutt out and put the original music at the Ewoks party back on during The Return of the Jedi ending. But that's only my opinion.
0385507755|5.0|I found this book listed as a suggested 'buy' with several others on a flyer inside my Barnes & Noble bag around Christmas time. I'm so glad I kept & read the flyer! The hardest part in reading the book was reliving alot of the same scenarios that my pain pill and crack addicted boyfriend of over 3-1/2 years has gone through. Nothing, truly NOTHING, in these past few years, has had a greater impact on me and him than this book. No in-patient or out-patient treatments he's gone through, no AA/NA/Alanon meetings, none of his 'Sponsors', no individual/group/family therapy, none of the piles of literature we've accumulated on drug addiction, nothing has hit the nail on the head like A Million Little Pieces. THIS IS ADDICTION, point blank. If you want to know what it's like to be an addict, read this book. My boyfriend read it cover to cover after he hit his personal rock bottom not too long ago and was equally as struck as I was by the reality. It was like reading about his own life. White, educated, handsome man from an upper middle class background with well-meaning but enabling parents turns into simply a thieving, lying, pill popping, low-life crackhead. But by the grace of God and after reading & so closely relating to James Frey's own story, he's drug-free and recovering from the damage today.
B00005JMX6|2.0|Movie was drivel but there were some excellent songs particularly David Gray's This Years Love that i was introduced to. I'm definately checking out his CD's and there were some other good songs as well. I've already totally forgotten about the movie but that song is lingering in my head.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie was a great movie it shows you that drugs tear your life up slowly and you might not notice it. The way the film was put together makes it such a good movie. One of the best films i have seen.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I read the AP interview. Arrogant to say the least. He has a point about them being \\"his\\" films, but I didn't agree with his points about most artists wanting to go back and change their work. I'd say a lot are satisfied with their final products, especially non-commercial artists. And how many filmmakers go back and change their movies 20 years after the fact? Part of filmmaking is working within the boundaries set for you, and that's not just technologically. The acting isn't always what you wanted, you had to alter the lighting after the fact, etc. But you move on to something else. Lucas is in love with his own creation, and what a creation it is, but for him to say he only liked 25 to 30 percent of it? Heck, give me back the other 75 or 70 percent and see if The Empire Strikes Back gets made. Simple fact: the 1977 version of Star Wars was the film that eventually made him billions, yes, billions of dollars. To turn his back on the literally tens of millions of fans who want the option too see that film is unforgivable.
B0002HTZJI|5.0|Great CD but i would love to have heard some Hillel Slovak Era. Songs.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I bought this DVD because I thought that in a concert which was in Las Vegas, Britney would have sang some of the songs, but...<br /><br />She doesn't sing any of the 16 songs, except \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", that's the only song she sings in the whole concert, but the concert itself is great!<br /><br />The stage where she \\"performs\\" is awesome, with fireworks, bunji flights, a \\"flying stage\\" in some songs, and the most amazing of all is the rain in the stage (of coure the people don't ger wet) in Baby One More Time. There's something else I have to object: the DVD does not include any special featurette!<br /><br />In other countries, the DVD includes 3 music videos (I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected and I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman) and the Crossroads movie trailer. The DVD is great, and the new versions for some of the songs are awesome, the only one bad thing is that she doesn't sing almost any of the songs.<br /><br />TRACKLISTING:<br /><br />Intro<br /><br />Oops!

B0002TT0NW|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER MOVIE YET,AND IS MUCH BETTER THAN CHAMBER OF SECRETS AND SOCERERS STONE!THE OTHER TWO WERE GOOD BUT THIS IS THE BEST ONE!I LIKE IT ALOT AND HOPE THEY MAKE THE MOVIE OF,\\"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE\\"!
B000000W5N|5.0|It's pretty easy to avoid overpraising an album that is bracketed by two of the best expressions of the rock'n'roll sensibility ever recorded.  <br /> <br />\\"Sticky Fingers\\" followed 1969's apocalyptic masterpiece \\"Let It Bleed\\" and preceded 1972's kaleidoscopic riffmixer \\"Exile on Main Street\\" in a string that also included \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out;\\" no popular music act ever beat, and no more than three ever came close to matching, that stretch of sustained excellence.   <br /> <br />Of these records, I have to say that \\"Sticky Fingers\\" may have suffered from being the most accessible; it's been the rule with me that hating a record on first listen means a love affair in the making. I sure didn't have that problem with this one. At age fourteen, I melded the snippets that I heard of \\"Sticky Fingers\\" into my personal soundtrack of the summer of 1971. \\"Brown Sugar\\" shook me when I first heard it; \\"Wild Horses\\" had a similarly seismic effect on my teen hormones. I'd hear bits and pieces wafting from that gorgeous 18-year-old brunette's apartment, near the beach at Ocean City, and think, hmmmmm. Maybe I have to buy this one soon. When I did, no adjustment period was required. It was love at first listen.  (I mean, I HATED the other records in this string when I first heard them.)  <br /> <br />You know? Maybe the REALLY great stuff is like THAT. If I could only save one record (please God let that cup pass my lips) from my blazing bedroom, \\"Exile\\" might still be it. But I'd tell the firefighters not to come out without this one. Its first three songs may be the best 1-2-3 punch on any rock record. \\"Brown Sugar\\" is the most overplayed number I still insist on playing; it's still air-guitar/air-sax heaven, with bathroom-mirror singing parts. I'm happy, though, to see all the plugs on this site for \\"Sway,\\" my favorite Stones song. The lyrics are powerful, Mick's countdown at the start a moodsetter, the Mick/Keith duet drowned by the solo at the end classic Stones harmony, the rhythm guitar majestically orchestral (one almost doesn't need the strings that one thanks God are in there to lift the song into the upper atmosphere at the end), Mick Taylor's lead solo soaring like no other on a Stones song (it actually starts to peak right at the fadeout). When I put this record on to hear one song, \\"Sway\\" is always it; when I grab a selection, \\"Sway\\" is always one of them.  <br /> <br />But the album keeps moving from strength to strength: the country perfection of \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Dead Flowers\\" (the '68 - '72 Stones are the best-ever C/W band); the pure blues of \\"You Gotta Move\\" and the blues/gospel tints of \\"I Got the Blues,\\" the dirty swing of \\"Bitch,\\" the strung-out nightmare of \\"Sister Morphine\\" (actually my least favorite on this record full of favorites), and finally \\"Moonlight Mile,\\" proving once and for all that it takes a really strong rock band to be gentle. The string chord at the end of this song ties in my mind with the final notes of \\"From the Morning\\" from Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" for best record closer ever.  <br /> <br />(And I had to come back to plug \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\\" one of the alltime great guitar workouts. This album is that good.)  <br /> <br />\\"Sticky Fingers\\" is in no way one of those records that reveals new layers with every listen. There's not a busted pick on this record I haven't heard a thousand times. Rather, the things you keep on hearing, keep on delivering, time after hi-test time. Underrated? Hmmmmm. Maybe not. I'll check back and let you know how high this one eventually goes on my all-time best list. It's on the Up elevator. And climbing. <br /> <br />
B00009W0U4|4.0|We read headlines about rape and murder and these are just words, or worse yet statistics.  We live our lives insulated from such horrors, unless....unless we take the wrong street, or meet the wrong person on the wrong day in the wrong neighborhood or find ourselves in a situation spiraling wildly out of control.  And then, suddenly, shockingly our lives will never be the same. <br /> <br />If you've the stomach for it, Irreversible will bring that nightmare scenario right up front and center and shove it in  your face.  Three lives lived in pleasant middle-class gentility will be torn apart and, if not utterly destroyed, certainly forever horribly altered by a violent rape and the violence it engenders. <br /> <br />As noted by others, the film is presented in reverse order and is characterized by wildly spinning camera moves and similar creative flourishes, with the notable exception of the pivotal rape scene which is presented straight on in all it's horror and ugliness.  The opening of the film, plunging us into a gay S&M sex club presented as some lower ring of Dante's Inferno is disorienting, shocking and terrifying.  Working backward from the brutality we witness there, a story is pieced together that shows how savage act is followed by more savagery....and no justice for anyone involved. <br /> <br />This is the type of movie hard to recommend.  Many would not want to take this trip and I can understand that.  It is certainly not a film I would want to watch repeatedly either.  But, like Leaving Las Vegas and other films that show the uglier side of life, when done with passion and commitment they can be worth your time. <br /> <br />Shot in long takes, and apparently much improvised, the director and actors here are doing something more than just trying to shock you for exploitative reasons.  The language is as harsh and brutal as the visuals, showing how unbridled rage coarsens even usually civilized people.  It makes the later part of the movie even morepoignant when we see tenderness and love and joking amongst them. <br /> <br />Not for everyone, if you aren't ready and interested in very tough material, give this a pass.  For those who dare, this is a challenging film that will haunt you for days.  It still lingers and resonates with me.
B00005JN7O|3.0|Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow give Sleep-Ez performances in this extra cheesy flashback of the old 1940's sci-fi shorts your grandparents saw at the old movie theaters.  <br />New York is attacked (great timing for 9/11, eh?) by an army of airborne robots so big that, theoretically, there wouldn't be enough metal on planet Earth to create them all.  <br />Jude Law plays Sky Captain, the leader of an unnamed organization of independent defenders fighting the threat of overacting.  Gwyneth plays the very nasally speaking Polly, a newspaper reporter, whose main goal is to be more irritating and lie more than any ex you've ever had.  <br />For the waaaay older crowd, this might be considered a good movie.  To those under 70, it's a waste of time.  Angelina Jolie might have been able to save the movie a little more if she showed more than her trademark bubba lips.  <br />Not much for warnings on this one: overacting, whiny voices (mainly by Gwyneth), and the CGI disembodiment of the late Laurence Olivier as the villain Toten Kopf, and the anorexic Bai Ling in a non-speaking role (thank God) as his 'assistant'.  <br />This one wouldn't be worth the matinee or evening show prices.  <br />
0156027321|4.0|Although I initially had a difficult time engaging with this book, in the end it swept me along and was one of the more fulfilling reading experiences I've had in some time. Beautifully written in a sparse style reminiscent of \\"Old Man and the Sea,\\" the story veers between the fantastic and the factual, blurring the lines between the two until both appear equally real. Part Robinson Crusoe, part fairy-tale, in the end it leaves you wondering about faith, endurance, and the power of the human spirit.

B00003CXTG|5.0|What a great movie! I fell in love with this movie the first time a saw it I and then had to buy it on DVD, Which also offers an impressive list of extras.The film twists between the events of Pearl Harbour and the love and friendship between it's characters. This film is cast perfectly starring Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Ben Afflek, Cuba Gooding Jr, and William Lee Scatt to name my favourites. The events of Pearl Harbour are portrayed well, leading to an incredibly moving film, which i have to say i cry every time a watch it! <br />I love this film and recommend it to anyone who likes War, Drama and romance! A must for every DVD collection
B00005JN7O|4.0|In a gorgeous 1948 [?] of RADAR, dirigibles, disembarcations at the Empire State Building -- all in the 1st 10 minutes! -- the hero to call in emergencies is the heroic Sky Captain.  Jude Law is the handsome hero who inhabits these lovely CGI landscapes, & he fits in amazingly well.  Killer robots, a secret base, and an exotic flying aircraft carrier made/manned by the UK, -Sky Capt- also features a plucky asistant Dex [Giovanni Ribisi] , a villainous Lawrence Olivier in a powerful if posthumous role, Sir Michael Gambon as Mr. Paley, the reporter's boss, & the heroic Frankie Cook [played by Angelina Jolie] who commands the above-mentioned UK carrier.<br /><br />Portraying lovers even more cursed than King Kong & Ann Darrow, Gweneth Paltrow & Jude Law shine in what had to be difficult roles; most of this movie existed only in  a computer.  Green-screen acting is a revolutionary experience for both actor & CGI artist, & the stars carry out their parts swimmingly.  Altho Paltrow can be irritating as a reporter, who does everything wrong [hey, i was a reporter & i never did any of that stuff!] & who screams a lot, as well.  But she hits her marks & says her lines so convincingly that i was irritated at *her* rather than 'her character'.  Throw in some charming toss-aways: a Professor's lab address is 1138, Godzilla shows up in a Tokyo newspaper, & both the -Venture- [the ship from -King Kong-] & the -Titanic- make sneak cameos -- & you've got a film that enchants as it sweeps you into a Universe that never existed.<br /><br />We went to see this w/a friend from Scotland who sighed afterwards, \\"Cheese.  But the very best Ermanthaler cheese!\\"  A good description; it is cheesy.  But, hey, i'd live there in a heartsbeat!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Before I heard this cd,Rooney was in my cd player 24/7, but now Jet is. Jet is so great. Thier cd does have some flaws, but over all it's AWESOME! Well,I'm not going to ramble on and on about how they copied other groups etc... So, here is what I think of the song on the cd: <br /> <br />The Best songs: <br />Are you gonna be my girl?- the main reason I got the cd <br />Rollover DJ- This song is very addictive <br />Move on- One of the best slow songs on the cd <br />Cold Hard Bitch- The best song on this album <br />Timothy- One of the best closing songs ever. Puts you in a mellow mood <br />Come Around Again- The last 2 minutes of this song is the best <br />part of the song <br /> <br />The Okay Songs: <br />Look what you've done- It's good, but could have been better <br />Radio Song- two words: filler song but it's still okay <br />Get what you need- Could hve been better. It's fair. <br /> <br />The Bad Songs: <br />Take it or Leave it- Could have bee longer, but still wouldn't helped the song <br />Lazy Gun- no comment ( it's that bad) <br />Last Chance- in my opinion the worst song on the cd. They should have never started the cd with this song <br />  <br />So, now you see what I think of Jet.  I hope their next cd is just as great or better.  <br />
B000006YYW|5.0|How Old Are You? is the second solo album of Robin Gibb.  The first one was Robin's Reign.  The next few ones are Secret Agents, Wall Have Eyes, and Magnet.  This album is very strong and includes hits such as Juliet, Another Lonely Night In New York, and Heart on Fire.  Robin was surely trying to do his best. Great job, robin.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Still not as moving as \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\"... and strangely enough, I found the crucifixtion in that film almost more disturbing to watch than the \\"Passion\\"'s gore fest.  It almost tried to show too much, which took away from something that none of us have any proof actually happened that exact way.  But this is one man's vision.   <br /> <br />... and Mel accomplished what he apparently set out to do, so... kudos to you Mel.
B0000047CX|5.0|In my youth, my parents would play this album and it would always be a breezy, wonderfully beautiful time.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I seriously can't believe all the people blasting this film for the small changes in these DVD versions. Who cares? Are the classic films ruined just because of some small cosmetic changes and minor scenes? Answer these truthfully and you will realize just how lucky we are to get these films on DVD. <br />I for one am grateful we're finally getting the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and eagerly look forward to 9/21.
1592400876|4.0|While reading this book I learned that telling friends that one is reading a book on punctuation results in puzzled looks.  Nonetheless, I found this book to be both a helpful refresher course in correct pronunciation and a highly entertaining and enlightening read.  Looking at other reviews, it is evident that some people do not understand or appreciate British humor.  I found that I could not read it in public without embarrassing myself laughing out loud.  While providing such comic relief, Truss reviews the history of various punctuation marks, demonstrates proper usage, and makes a compelling case for the importance of correct pronunciation in this unfortunate age of e-mail communications -- not to mention online book reviews.
B00007LTIL|5.0|The point of these reviews is not to attack the artists (or the lifestyles of their fans), but to try to describe and/or objectively critique the music.  Yes, people are allowed their opinions, but an album such as American Beauty clearly is a classic folk-rock album, and to try to label it as a one-star piece of music just ain't right.  That being said, this album is one half of the pair with \\"Workingman's Dead\\" that appeared in 1970.  The Dead had already established themselves as a psychedelic bluesy jam-rock band, and had a loyal following.  However, they had not created much in the way of well-crafted songwriting until these two albums were recorded.  Basically, they fused together blues, country, boogie-woogie, traditional roots, and folk into a unique sound.  While Workingmans Dead may have more blues influence, this album leans a bit more towards folk and country.  Many of the songs are slow and introspective.  Please don't be scared away by reviewers who have some strange axe to grind -- trust the rest of us, and the fact that established music guides all rate this as a true classic.
B000002UZ1|5.0|The only reason I bought this album was because it happened to have almost all the song's on another great Beatles album name \\"Hey Jude\\" which I own on an original 33 1/3 record and can't find on CD anywhere. I can't really buy a portable Record player. So this will have to do. Plus it has other great Beatles song's. You would enjoy this album, especially if you are just starting to like The Beatles.
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth came back with a heavy album called The System Has Failed with speed metal but RUST IN PEACE is a Megadeth fan must have and one of megadeth's best album <br /> <br />
B00006SFLV|5.0|Angela Chase is your typical teen in many ways. But her character is complex and defies the standard of your average teen girl. She has two parents who desparately try to communicate and understand their complicated daughter and a little sister who often gets on her nerves. Her best friend is a \\"trouble-maker\\" who finds herself in trouble with alcohol, drugs and other issues and a love interest who doesn't exactly live up to the standards of a true \\"boyfriend.\\" <br /> <br />These characters engage us in complex ways. You find yourself empathzing with each but always \\"routing\\" for Angela. All of the embarrassing, awkward moments throw us back to our own high school years. The first loves, difficulty in certain classes and challening relationships with our siblings and parents. This was one of the best series on television and we are fortunate to have it available on DVD.
B000002V0Q|5.0|My fav Megadeth album is Rust In Peace but CTE is a great heavy metal album this is a megadeth must have all the songs are great all of them just kicks ass!! <br /> <br />go buy this album!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|You know that seven minutes this *bleep* keeps harping about -- that has nothing to do with 9/11, that's how long it takes him to inhale seven slices of pizza!!!!    I wouldn't give this *bleep\\" one cent of my money to see his pack of celluloid lies. Go W!
B00005JNEI|4.0|I have been reading the reviews to help me decide if I should buy or rent this movie. Yes, in other words, I have not seen it yet, and I can certainly not comment on its content. In fact, Mr. Moore has a clean slate with me since I haven't seen any other movies of his either. What propels me to write a comment anyway is the content (or lack thereof) of many of the negative reviews presented here. Why do so many reviewers have to resort to name calling and insults? Why are so few negative reviews containing any substance, i.e., factual contradiction of the opinions expressed in the movie? Mr. Moore must have made at least that much of an attempt to present what are facts in his mind, otherwise it would have been a pretty short movie! <br /> <br />One cannot help but wonder - simply because of the lack of factual rebuttal - if there isn't more truth than fiction to the movie. However, whether one agrees or disagrees with the movie's theories, likes or dislikes Moore's opinions, name calling and insults are inappropriate! It is downright scary, given their vast number, that those people who resort to such inappropriateness are exactly those that declare they support Mr. Bush. Even if one knew nothing about Mr. Bush, wouldn't one have to wonder what kind of person or leader he might be if he appeals so strongly to people who demonstrate such poor judgement when it comes to inappropriate behavior and, by extrapolation, values and ethics? <br /> <br />Even if this movie were to be based on nothing but lies and misrepresentation of facts, the simple fact that it accomplishes to reveal this particular character flaw, if you will, in a great number of its opponents DOES make it an excellent movie in my opinion!! For that alone I have to give it a positive rating, even if it should turn out to otherwise disappoint me.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I have to say I am very upset with the low quality of this album. Let's look at the tracks: <br />1. American Life - started out as a good tune until Madonna trys her hand at rapping (very bad idea especially when it is about lattes and excercise routines)2/5 <br />2.Hollywood - this one is okay, but the lyrics are pretty cheesy 3/5 <br />3.I'm So Stupid - one of the better tracks on the album, the groovy beat and vocals are worth a listen. 5/5 <br />4. Love Profusion - not much to this one 2/5 <br />5.Nobody Knows Me - hard to tell this one from the previous track 1/5 <br />6.Nothing Fails - This one is very good, besides the whole part about not being religious but she wants to pray 4/5 <br />7.Intervention - yet another boring song 1/5 <br />8.X-Static Process - this one is listenable, but just barely 3/5 <br />9.Mother & Father - still trying to prove that she has issues 2/5 <br />10.Die Another Day - probably one of the best James Bond theme songs ever - way to go! 5/5 <br />11. Easy Ride - good lyrics, could of used more powerful vocals so they didn't seem to get lost in there but this is one of the best ones on here 5/5
B00003CX95|4.0|\\"They can take our lives but they cannot take away our freedom\\". Something about this war cry suggests an anachronistic anomaly, but fortunately the rest of the film is so powerfully executed with such a satisfactory abundance of high-octane battle scenes that it makes up for every little guff.<br /><br />Why let minor trivia like historical accuracy detract you from a fabulous Hollywood action flick? If films were produced merely for accuracy, all of our films would look like The Passion. Braveheart, ironically, is a lot more passionate.
B000002UAU|3.0|THe beatles where a band with some talent and they did write a few good songs but this is not the best album ever over even close to the rock and roll spirtit. First of the title track sgt. peppers. That song flat out sucks. Second the betles never really influenced any one after 1975 and their influence is not heard at all today. They where the first band to write music that would be popular not good and lasting. THey did not even have the best album of that year which belongs to the velvet undergrund Who where not a bunch of hippies that did not fallow trends and did influence a million more people then the beatles ever thought of. The beatles where like a paperback writer they write good music for the time and the era and sell millions of copies but that does not make their music good or bad,it make s it middle of the rod, but there is more music out there. That puts the beatles to shame and has more of that rock and roll spirit.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Moore turns up the volume in this relentless assault on President Bush, but when we get past his overt bias, and the fact that a film of this cadre has been allowed to play in the first place during a reign that he denounces with such vitriol, we recognize that F-9/11 does have a lot to offer.<br /><br />His antics (such as reading the Patriot Act over a loudspeaker from an ice cream truck outside the White House) are as funny as ever, and some of his questions (why exactly WAS a Taliban official in Dallas in 2001 anyway) really do merit consideration.<br /><br />Even the most staunch critics of this film's message and ideology will have to admit that Moore did his homework this time around. Unlike BFC, even if the chronology of the footage in this context was altered, it would still be equally incriminating. The film is a blistering indictment chock full of factual information (service records, taped interviews, real video footage) that cannot be categorically labeled as false.<br /><br />My gripes have more to do with some narrative decisions:<br /><br />(1) We spend a lot of time showing Bush and Company combing their hair and primping for TV. Doesn't everyone undergo similar preparation before going on air? The sequence is of no real value to the film and inflates the running time by several wasted minutes, especially when a single frame of preening is repeated over and over again.<br /><br />(2) Seems a little unfair to rope in a teen popstar to support the idea. She's a kid and for what it is worth, I believe she handled an unexpected question that was clearly out of her league rather graciously.<br /><br />(3) The episode asking senators to sign their kids up for war was a bit messy. If you were a senator and had a documentary film producer walk up to you with an application form and a TV crew, would you say, \\"Gee since this may be in public view, and since you are such an important and appropriately authorized person for this job, here, let me sign up my daughter to be shipped to Iraq\\"? Can't see what the idea behind this was, especially because the senator says that he HIMSELF was in the navy.<br /><br />(4) The scenes at the end with a bereaved woman are a bit drawn out (even if moving at first) and seemed to blame the Republicans for sending her son to war. This to me comes across as self-contradictory as the woman herself had said earlier that army was a good workaround lifestyle for people in her impoverished town. When one signs up for war, isn't he expected to know what it entails? Sounds a bit convenient to want the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Anyway, these are minor gripes in comparison to the bigger picture that the film addresses.<br /><br />You may agree or disagree with its assertions, question/deride the validity of its arguments, or use it as a point of reference, but at the very least Fahrenheit 9/11 hits all the right nerves. Some of the footage from US blanket bombing (oops, precision bombing) of Iraq is gutwrenching.<br /><br />A movie I highly recommend regardless of your political or ideological stance, if only for the perspective of the innocent being maimed in a land that posed or poses no threat to the US, even if they have WMDs hidden somewhere deep in the bowels of their natural oil fields.ghter to be shipped to Iraq\\"?

B00005JMEW|4.0|As a massive Tarantino fan, I will not try and sugarcoat \\"kill Bill\\" for the few of you who havent seen it, its certainly Tarantinos weakest film yet. It doesnt contain the suspense of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", the ultra cool interlocks of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or the sheer watchability of \\"Jackie brown\\". But, as many a fan will tell you, a under-par Tarantino film is still twice as good as most Jerry Bruckheimer productions (bar \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Pirates of Carribeann\\"). <br /> <br />The story is simple, former assaasin who. on her wedding day, is shot in the head, along with all the guests, by her former colleagues (Lucy Liu, Vivica A Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah) and her boss, Bill. She also loses her unborn child. 45 years later shge wakes up in coma, and sets out for revenge, and by revenge I mean BLOODY RETRIBUTION. <br /> <br />So armed with a legendary Hitori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) sword begins her quest with O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox).  <br /> <br />On the excitment side, Kill Bill Vol 1 delivers by the bucket load, an amzing confrontation with a army known as the Crazy 88 followed by the stunning samurai battle with O-Ren Ishi in the snow. Watch the red hit white. *That means blood and snow*. <br /> <br />Also, Uma Thurman's performance is excellent, you have to wonder why she is most under rated actresses in Hollywood. <br /> <br />The direction is varied, however. Some things are truly fantastic, like the colours the film uses and some sound effects. <br /> <br />Its hard to judge one half of a film, but this really is action over story, and the film could have done with a bit more of Michael Madsen or David Carridine (Bill). <br /> <br />Nevertheless, gret rental material, and of course, perfect if you want to see Kill Bill Vol 2. <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|It's that good. Every once in a while there is an album that finds you empty and purposeless, fills all your voids and makes you feel complete again. An absolute must have. Listen to \\"Bedshaped\\",\\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" but the WHOLE CD is absolutely breathtaking. I haven't felt chills like this over music in years.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Being a bonafide Britney hater,I gotta say that this album is so crappy that anybody that buys it needs to get help.I mean,who wants to hear this trash.If you`re looking for a better pop artist,I would recommend that you listen to that new CD by JoJo. She`s hot,she can sing and she isn`t trashy like Britney Spears.
0066620996|5.0|This book is a great look at what distinguishes companies that have enduring greatness, and what it took to get them there.  Jim Collins makes it very clear that he is not offering a roadmap as to how to create a great company, but rather he is presenting the differences that exist in a company that is great versus similar companies that are not great.    I believe this book is a must read for anyone who is involved in the operation and running of a corporation of any size.  While I found it short on answers, the questions it generated made me take a good hard look at myself and my company.    Jim Collins has a very engaging writing style, and I enjoyed reading the book in addition to learning what it had to teach.
B0002EXH4K|2.0|If you listen to this new version of countdown you miss out on so much. And you might think; well I don't care it's the songs that are important not the production and I get alot of bonus songs with this one but when the producer miss out on basic things like getting the volume levels right and maintaining the atmosphere it just isn't the same anymore. This album is sloppy produced with only one thing in mind, and that is to milk the most money out of fans possible from this already perfectly produced album. The only bonus song that isn't a demo(shrug) is crown of worms and that is available on the terrific maxi-single 'train of consequences'.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This CD is quite good.  The band really sets itself apart from the crowd and establishes it's own sound. <br />I get such a kick out of the little emo kiddies that get on here and label bands pretentious or sell-outs because their music changed or they dared to be a little more inventive and explore different musical styles.  It is hugely ironic that these same people would dare to call someone else pretentious when they are popping onto message boards and claiming their opinions on music to be fact (or even valid in some cases?) and explaining how it is somehow wrong to attempt to add some variety to a CD.   <br />Get over yourselves kids.  No one is impressed with your ability to develop a negative opinion of anything or anyone that is successful or that manages to gather up enough creativity to actually change their sound occasionally.  Perhaps the artists just didn't get to put in the same kind of television/video game time as you and managed to spare their creative spirit? <br /> <br />-The Stiphness
B000002KKD|4.0|Many of my friends hate the B-52's.. frankly at times I don't blame them... their music circa cosmic thing was so overplayed when I was growing up.  Yes Cosmic thing is a fun album and every party I attended in MIddleschool usually ended up playing Love shack before the night ended... but it lacks something compared to their first album.. or could be thought of as over burdened. <br /> <br />   Secondly I admitt to loving Pop music.. But the First B-52 album sounded so fresh and unique.. the band members weren't great musicians technically... but so much more energy radiates through when the band itself plays and writes their music as opposed to having other musicians and tons of production. <br /> <br />This is just a fun album and one of the most interesting sonic experiences out there.  The first four songs are what makes this album classic.. Planet claire is the perfect way to immerse the listner into the B-52's sound.  Starting with the soft menacing guitar at the begining then breaking out the organ... enter fred...  <br /> <br />Lava and Hero Worship are good songs, they aren't the same quality as the first four and by this point in the album feel alot less fresh and creative.. the songs at the end tend to run a bit together.. while there's a moon in the sky and 6060-842 get a bit annoying an repetitive..  <br /> <br />The cover of Downtown feels appropriate as a closer.. <br /> <br />Overall this album is a good time and probably the most interesting and invigorating B-52 album... <br /> <br />Even some people who hate the bands later material will concede that the music on this album is something worth hearing.
B00005JAVO|5.0|With this 1973 album Led Zeppelin continues to cause trouble by offering an album cover by Hipgnosis with naked blonde children climbing a bunch of rocks without any reference to the title or even the name of the band. The group figured everybody would know about \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and insisted on finding new ways of tweaking their noses at the music business beyond producing songs that were way too long for AM Top 40 airplay. There were those of us who were just happy that there was an official name to Led Zep's fifth album after the previous one was known variously as \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" \\"Runes\\" and \\"ZOSO.\\" \\"House of the Holy\\" is very similar to that album in that once again there are no length blues tracks as you would find on their first three albums, although we do have John Paul Jones playing with his synthesizer on \\"No Quarter,\\" which became his signature song.<br /><br />What we do have are more examples of Led Zep's version of rock 'n' roll where the bass lines and Bonzo's drumming come up big with \\"The Ocean\\" (I like the odd little a cappella section) and \\"Dancing Days,\\" as well as the folk influence on the acoustic beginning to \\"Over the Hills and Far Away.\\" We even have one of the better examples of Led Zep being cute with \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" (\\"Me wife is going on vacation.\\" \\"Jamica?\\" \\"No, she's going of her own free will...\\") and the group's first attempt to try to duplicate the success of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with the lush synthetic strings of \\"The Rain Song.\\" Actually, I think the opening track, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is a better effort along those lines, covering much more ground both musically and vocally.  You always get the feeling that Jimmy Page is always looking for the perfect song to not only start off an album but to open a concert, which probably makes it ironic that the song they apparently used most often was \\"Rock and Roll,\\" the second track from their fourth album. Overall, \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is probably the best of the second level Led Zeppelin albumsel Led Zeppelin albums  <br />
B000063DFQ|5.0|this is my personal favorite maiden album. theres only one song i really dislike so heres my song by song review: <br /> <br />Where Eagles Dare: 5/5 awesome opening, great tune, really good drumming <br /> <br />Revelations: 5/5 a bit slower, bruce tests his vocal range amd it has one of my favorite maiden riffs  <br /> <br />Flight of Icarus: 5/5 great chorus, really catchy <br /> <br />Die With Your Boots On: 5/5 my favorite song on the album, good lyrics, good riffs and solos <br /> <br />The Trooper: 5/5 most famous song off the album, another good one, maybe the tiniest bit over rated <br /> <br />Still Life: 3/5 eh, not special <br /> <br />Quest for Fire: 2/5 im sure everybodys gonna say the same thing and its probly getting annoying, but the thing is this song really sucks the lyrics are cheesy and stupid just skip it <br /> <br />Sun and Steel: 4/5 people really dont like this song i think its ok though, pretty catchy <br /> <br />To Tame a Land: 4/5 all the singing is at the very beginning and the remaining 5 mins are pure guitar which really bothers me but ill rate it based on its quality <br /> <br /> <br />solid maiden album, worth getting for Die with your boots on since you cant get it on greatest hits albums.. except maybe best of the beast im not sure... Well get it anyway great album
B000002P5R|5.0|The first two Jimi Hendrix albums (Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold As Love) both have a very similar pshycadelic tone, harder rock, with distinctive and wildly elaborate guitar solos. Jimi's third album, Electric Ladyland was quite different. While maintaining the tone the other albums had, Hendrix was much more experimental with this album. Songs like 1983 and Rainy Day, Dream Away were different than anything anybody had ever done before, and it was in this sense less of a mainstream, radio album than his first two albums.  <br />       With First Rays of the New Rising Sun, Jimi Hendrix's style is yet again dramatically different than ever before. You can see a shift from the acid rock of the late 60's into a funkier genre. A prime example of this are the songs Izabella and Ezy Rider. Jimi Hendrix fans may find it hard to get used to this change of pace, but once you do, you'll learn to love it. This album seems to me almost as if it's an introduction to the 70's and 80's funk rock, with heavier base lines and condensed guitar riffs. The whole album seems to be much more mellow than anything else he's done. On the other albums it sounds like Hendrix is forcing you into each song, pounding away at your stereo with his crazy guitar, but here, it's almost as if he's leaning back and giving you a chance to listen and absorb his music. This album is more artful and sweet with fewer pounding guitar lines. I personally prefered the other albums by just a little over this one. The songs are quite catchy and done in an intresting way with the background vocals. His guitar is still a force to be reckoned with, in a quiter, more soft spoken way. There are a ton of great songs you won't want to miss out on. The guitar intro in Freedom is easily comparable to that in Purple Haze. Angel is a beatifully done song that holds its own against Little Wing and The Wind Cries Mary. I loved Hey Baby (New Rising Sun) a quite song thats great to sit down and listen too all the way through. Ezy Rider and Room Full of Mirrors are absolutely foot thumping funk rock tunes, and In From the Storm has an awesome riff.  <br />      Problems? Well, many of the songs aren't finished and still were in need of overdubs. The difference is slight, but it's there. Many of the songs take some getting used to. When I first got the album, I had my doubts and was a little disappointed, but once you have it for a few days and really listen carefull, you'll love it. I promise.
B00005A46T|1.0|jesus christ. i hate this band. and i REALLY hate nu metal. it takes no talent whatsoever, the most talent these fags have is the ability to beat the sh*t out of their instruments with masks on that practically suffocate them. they screw up everything. they even screwed up swear words. every time i listen to an interview with corey (the singer) every other word out of his mouth is f*ck. im not exaggerating. listen to an interview with that flamer and youll see what i mean. what really pisses me off is the fact that whenever i see somebody who listens to them, they think that slipknot is some kind of death metal hardcore band. that is the biggest load of prarie sh*t i have ever heard. they are no different than linkin park, except they use much more profanity and for no reason. ive been playing the drums for about 2 months, my brother has been playing guitar for 2 months, and my best friend has been playing for 1 month. even with our extreme lack of experience we could play a slipknot song flawlessly and probably improve it. it takes that little talent. i cant even explain the pure hatred i have for these jackasses. and theyre so damn b*tchy. all they do is complain about how God doesnt love them and they have no friends. well, theres nine f*cking people in the band so obviously those assh*les do have little buddies. look at other \\"satanic bands\\". the bands that write about satanism, such as ozzy, alice cooper, iron maiden, slayer, etc., arent actually satanists, they just like to scare people. and they really dont b*tch about their lives, they write about dark themes such as hell, death, lyrics that mean something and are thought out. the only nig nogs that listen to this sh*t are mall goths who shop at hot topic and wear 3 foot chains and all black so they think theyre goths. to sum it up, slipknot suck, i hate them and all the wanna be metalheads that think that listening to slipknot make them heavy.
B00005JMJG|1.0|I would honestly give this negative five stars if I could.  It had the promise of a great story line, but I don't feel that it did anywhere near where it could have.  Neither did the rest of the audience in the theatre.  Half of them had left before the first half of the movie was done.  It was crappy (sorry Jim - I do normally love you).  Maybe I'm not artsey fartsey enough but I just didn't get this.
B0002S947K|5.0|Many of us had been taken with a few singles of Ray Lamontagne's offered by a local radio program of singer/songwriters for many months now.  Some of us were even fortunate enough to catch him live this summer.  To witness him, you immedediately hoped that whoever finally recorded him, recorded him for the right reasons, and appreciated how amazing he really is.  They got it right...it's all captured on this debut.  Be a total nerd and call the store and ask them to hold you a copy.  Heartbreaking, romantic as hell, politically captivating and energizing, and I'll say it again, magical--entrancing.  It's all here--best album/Cd I've heard in years.  Sara Watkins and Jennifer Stills offer some nice background vocals (and Sara fiddle), and Ethan Johns is a great accompaniest.  Remember why you loved music?
B00003CXCT|5.0|I too was one of the \\"lucky\\" audience members to have seen the original Star Wars on the big screen with the big \\"sensurround\\" speakers in the theater. What an awesome experience. I have a fond love for Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, but didn't too much care for Return of the Jedi. Nor have I seen anything of Episodes 1-3 that make me want to sit through them entirely. <br /> <br />Still this is a great set and definitely one to own. Like the recently remastered copies of The Indiana Jones trilogy, we've waited what seems like forever for this and Lucas' tinkering with HIS films is HIS perogative and HIS business. What if Terry Gilliam had never gotten a chance to share the \\"real\\" Brazil with audiences? What Lucas has done to this films, while being decried by many as \\"ruining\\" them, is instead retouching them to realize HIS vision for each project.  <br /> <br />Granted, there IS something nostalgic about the first releases of Star Wars and I suspect that at some point, Lucas being the merchandiser that he is, another set will be released with the unGGI'd versions. <br /> <br />In the meantime, let's stop all the carping about CGI enhancements, especially from those who will run out this weekend and waste their hard earned $ on \\"Sky CRAPtain\\".
B0002XVQNU|1.0|I loved the Daredevil movie... more than Spider-Man for that matter. However, I find it extremely insulting that there is a Special Edition for this movie. The original was released not even a year ago, and that one was supposeably loaded with \\"Special Features\\". My quarl is not just with Daredevil SE, but the slew of other SE DVDs (Hellboy, Jersey Girl, Matrix Reloaded) that are being released. The only purpose for SEs is when there was an older movie that wasn't properly released on DVD (released without any features, example Top Gun and Fasttimes). The distributer is just trying to sucker a few more dollars out of consumers hands. It would have been fine if they released this \\"Director's Cut\\" when the theatrical version was released (Like Riddick and Van Helsing will, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre did) You know give the opportunity for choice... <br /> <br />Anyway just as a heads up, this DVD will probably feature no more special features than the first edition. To be honest the only things different with the director's cut of the film is that there's a few words/utterences that were removed so that the film could be rated PG, and brief seconds of violence - it's more like a Producer's Cut. It is also worth noting that this DVD is going to be released the same week as Spider-Man 2 (an attempt to spounge off it) and is a marketing ploy (expect a free ticket offer or some coupon) for the Electra movie due out this Feb.
038572179X|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. The author does a masterful job of evidencing both the good and bad of the human spirit. The story and characters demonstrate just how faint the line is between innocence and guilt, between love and hate, between ambition and regret. Sometimes an overzealous helper can actually hurt and sometimes nothing can be said to mend old wounds. <br /> <br />Some things cannot be forgiven. <br /> <br />This story often recalls the same events from 3 or more perspectives, thus showing how a single action or statement can be interpreted in as many ways as there are people to witness it. <br /> <br />One good-intentioned act, erodes and destroys the bond between sisters, between family. After years of shame, hatred, guilt, confusion, sorrow... two sisters are reunited only to realize that old feelings still remain and that forgiveness is not possible. <br /> <br />The last 18 pages of the book, find the narrator at her 77th birthday, more than 60 years after her 'crime'. I cried from the beginning to end of this last section of the book. There were no happy resolutions, a young girl, now old woman. A life stolen away by one mistake. The loss is tremendous. <br /> <br />This book seemed tedious at first, but as the story unfolds, each detail comes to tell another part, or leads to another twist. The plot seems predictable at certain points, but this is part of the author's genius... leading the reader towards one outcome then revealing one completely unpredictable. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any human.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|She's an overblown wanna-be punk but sounds like Britney Spears nobody. She's overrated. She's the Shaq of music. She's just a marketing tool and this album sums it all up. The songs are not up to par and has she ever had singing lessons cause she needs em. She sounds like she's hurting herself. And what is wrong wtih her? She rich and seems happy so why does she dress and act like she's got a chip on her shoulder or pretend skateboarding is her thing. Avril fans need to take a look. This is not the real Avril and the only thing we know about her is that the lyrics in \\"Complicated\\" describe her perfectly.
B00006LLNV|3.0|I understand that the composer may have had good reasons for NOT using professional singers, but I would have enjoyed this disc much more WITHOUT the amateur vocals.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|I will not be purchasing this set now, or at any time in the future.  Sadly, this box-set is NOT the original trilogy.  As a movie purist I am shocked and saddened that my favorite childhood movie-memory is being tinkered with by it's own creator.  I love the Star Wars saga but for now I'll be content with my laserdiscs, which hold up very well to DVD.  Why not offer both versions on the same disc?  In my opinion Lucas has ruined the Star Wars world with his prequel movies; Jar Jar Binks? storyline?  bad acting? digital worlds? ... and now with this DVD set.  Imagine if Lucas had created Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (another favorite) and CG implanted more oompa loompa's into a scene that he felt needed more of them???  That's how I feel, & I'm sure I'm not the only one.
B000003BD3|4.0|I think it's a good piece of work.Now why hasn't anyone mentioned the identity of one of the members of the Tull lineup ? It's a good \\"document\\" of the era not great,         but important from the stand-point that there is so lit- <br />tle from that era of a visual nature that what there is <br /> of it, is in most cases nice to have.In my mind thats  <br />what kicks this up a bit is the knowledge that there are  <br />no vaults of material to draw from for some of the larg- <br />est acts of that time. Has anyone caught the visuals that      era available for one of the first power trios? Sad.  <br />Just try and dig the music for what it was,that's all.

B00005ATZT|2.0|In `The Fugitive', Andrew Davis chose to adapt a television icon into a vehicle for its star, Harrison Ford. Unfortunately, at the same time, Davis managed to provide an icon for a trend that has been plaguing films since, presumably, moviemakers began to run out of viable plot lines: the Dumbing Down of the American Audience Movie. Although numerous examples could be offered from the film to demonstrate this unfortunate trend, the four most vital ones should suffice:<br /><br />1) Ford, a successful and wealthy doctor, presented as being obviously close to his wife (or was her strewing of rose blossoms strictly for therapeutic effect?), is convicted of her killing with only weak and highly dubious evidence and motive which any decent attorney, let alone the battery of them he should have hired, would have shredded in no time.<br /><br /> 2) Since the crime was committed in Chicago, and Ford was remanded to the Illinois State prison for the carrying out of his sentence, a U.S. Marshal would not have had exclusive jurisdiction especially at the time the movie was made. Assuming Illinois was similar to most other states, their state police would have at least equal responsibility for escaped state felons, and even if help was given from the federal government it would have been on a collaborative basis. Both Tommy Lee Jones's right in asserting complete control of the case, and the arrogance in which he conducted himself throughout the movie, were ridiculous.<br /><br /> 3) The unjustly famous bus/train crash scene in fact, suffered from severe problems of continuity and logic. The bus clearly was not on any train tracks when it came to a rest; even if so given the nature of the terrain it rolled down it would have had to come to a rest along the tracks instead of across them; the entire scene shifted to an entirely different locale when the train did come along, including a large river below and beside the tracks; the second engine of the 2-engine train was obviouslywell beyond Ford instead of being behind him when it jumped the tracks; and in any event all he would have had to do was run a few yards at right angles to the engine's path instead of directly before it to escape it.<br /><br />4) The one-armed man stated to Jones that he had been previously investigated by the police for the murder of Ford's wife. As a matter of course they would then have discovered that both his position in and the nature of the company he was working for should have been more than enough to arouse ample suspicion and lead them to the true guilty parties.<br /><br />  Given these crucial shortcomings, along with the usual number of absurdities films of this type seem to indulge in (the Chicago police virtually en masse were portrayed as immoral and inept thugs), and the usual number of minor problems (Ford would have had to jump at least 30 feet out to hit the dam's converging water plumes and avoid the concrete wall, and from a standing position to boot!) and coincidences necessary to further the flow of the script (in the enormous Cook County Hospital complex Jones conveniently finds himself at a crucial time right outside the one department that gives him an insight into the crime), one wonders if most of the other reviews at this site were about the same movie, especially after its appearance on DVD allows for repeated viewings. The shame of it is that, given more care in directing and continuity, many of the above problems could have been eliminated and `The Fugitive' might well indeed have been an excellent movie.
B000002BPS|4.0|Not to say that this album has some good and some bad tracks. Rather it has two stand out songs, 'amazed' and 'all i want', two really catchy songs that anyone can enjoy, 'i choose' and 'dont pick it up'. Most of the other songs are good, apart from cool to hate. Does anyone know a good song with he word hate in it? Anyway Offspring admittidly wont ever sound too different, but having said that they do have more variety in this album than any other ive heard.In the past i would have given this 5 stars but ive grown out of this kind of music a bit. Still, much better than most metal bands. (zep and maiden excluded)
B00005JN7O|3.0|I generally liked Sky Captain.  It was obviously a labor of love by the creative team and towards the end it came together and felt full enough to be a fun joyride.  Little kids might love this film and I expect it will make some money, but it was less than the sum of it's parts & I felt kind of let down by the time I left the theater.    Unfortunately this felt more like a live-action comic book than a movie. Basically there are only 4-5 people in this film, and none of them were able to sustain this juggernaut without more and better dialogue and more humor.  They were trying for Cary Grant 40's style charming banter, but to me it sounded more like the outline of movie dialogue than an actual movie.    I also loved the CGI, but the story is full of gigantic, unmanageable plot holes so that I could only barely connect this world to any version of the 30's or 40's.  Things like 'where are the adults?' - is Sky Captain the top authority in the U.S. government?  Don't people usually die when they hit the water at 400mph and sustain a 30G impact? How does one fly from NYC to Nepal without refueling? And so on and on.       This type of movie requires an across-the-board suspension of disbelief which I can only grant to transcendent works of Genius, and this just didn't qualify.  It was meant to appear corny and charming like Indiana Jones, but it's just not solid enough.     Gwyneth Paltrow who is usually a warm and hypnotizing presence started out as a cool and untrustworthy and self-centered.  She has no vulnerability or quirks or virtues to make her likeable, and she only improves slightly towards the end.     Jude Law feels much more solid in his role and he does have Virtue in that he's trying to Save The World, but he's also similarly underwritten.    Giovani Ribisi once again has hit the jackpot as a nondescript talentless guy who somehow lands movie roles in Hollywood.     Basically nobody asks much from these actors and that's what they deliver. Jude and Gwyneth are both very talented and high-profile. They also have perfect posture & features and look like classic Greek gods in sepia-tone.  It's a pity they couldn't do more with this project.    In the end, Sky Captain felt to me like a film school project on steroids. It needed more script and better direction - my sense is that they'd let a 17-year old drive the Ferrari when he should have had a starter-car.   Ultimately it's a misfire which may make money but will end up in the bargain bin.
B000002UAX|5.0|f you are a true music fan and want to listen to an album that has influenced music IN A BIG WAY then this is THE album, lets get it right this is diverse ' nothing wrong with that', how come the only decent hip hop album this year was by \\"OUTCAST' , why?. I'll tell you why, they tried a different formula and guess what... It worked, lets remember music is about creative thinking and the beatles produced a great album here. I first heard it in 1981 and let me tell you it gets better with time, as with all the best music it grows on you. I won't even begin to list the number of artist that have imitated the Beatles (tooooooo many to mention) but what I will do is regard this as Album as a must for anybody who is interested in songwriting, music and production... AN ABSOLUTE GEM!!!!!!
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a truly delightful, enchanting book for those who enjoy Arthurian Legend. Alas, though I am only on about page 405, I just had to write a review. Morgaine(also known as Morgana Le Fay in Brian Froud's books and many other legends) is a priestess of Avalon, or was. This book is basicly like a study book of religion and Arthurian Legend, so you can learn alot from it. I loved the movie, but I have to say that the book is so much better because of the details left out. The only BAD thing is Gwenhwyfar. I know that sometimes she is right and I actually sometimes agree with what she says, but she is such a stubborn brat. She always has to(and does) get her way. But she has her own personality. Well, I recommend this book for fantasy lovers, because it is a good one.
B00001MXXH|5.0|When I first heard about Ferris Buller's day off, I wasn't all that interested. But when my mom brought it home one day and i watched it, it totally changed my opinion. It is such a funny movie!!! And all highschool kids can relate to the famous Ferris quote:\\"I do have a test today. That wasn't bull. It's on European Socialism. I mean, really, what's the point? I'm not European, I don't plan on being European, so why would I care if they were socialists? They could be fascit anarchists. It still doesn't change the fact that I don't own a car.\\" I think most of us can relate to that. This is one of my favorit movies, and I would recommend it to anyone, but I think it mainly appeals to people under 35. But hey, that's just me.
B00005JMAH|3.0|after reading some of the reviews on HP 3 the movie, i saw that there were two opinions...they should have stayed with the book, and that it was good as a movie. i personally kinda agree with both views. but have u noticed, this cuaron guy really likes to change around endings...he completely turned around a little princess(i watched it at a friends house) i mean dude...life and death are VERY different! anyway, because alfonmso cuaron left out sum important parts, u wouldnt get it if u havent read the books. my bro, my dad, and me are all enormous fans of the series, and we were all pretty disappointed.  my mom didnt have a clue WHAT WAS GOIN' ON! she asked us questions to clear up lik...the WHOLE MOVIE!i mean, seriously. and what happened to Oliver Wood and the quidditch house cup that griffindor won since like forever?  i was really lookin forward to that part, because ya no, this is my favorite book out of all 5 so far. also(tho i didnt really hav a problem with it) wuts with the talking, shrunken, Jamaican head? and why is tom a gross humpbaced...thing? he was normal in the first movie! also, tho many of u might disagree with me, i dont think hermione likes ron...she secretly likes draco.  yeah call me crazy but wuteva.and where was hermione and ron's big huge major mayb the end of their friendship fight? i mean when hermione asks for an apology about scabber's , you dont really get it cuz u didnt see the fight. and wut about her bein all exhausted and stuff? HELLO she took ALL the courses availabale!also, isn't sirius supposed to hav the remains of good looks, i mean, he used to be HOT before he was convicted... and they forgot all about explaining the nicknames... anyhoo, bout the other opinion. i must say, this one was more interesting than the other two-they were too slow.but this one is  too fast. it was ok, but disappointing. anyway, my suggestion is watch this movie, but deffinately read the book since you'll deffinately be enchanted by that!
B00005JN7O|2.0|Unlike many of the reviewers to date, I actually SAW this movie.  While the CGI artwork is beautiful, the tons of special effects start to numb the senses very quickly.  The dialogue is so banal, it doesn't deserve to be called campy; it's just bad dialogue.  Jude Law is too much of a wispy and wimpy type to be an impressive hero and Gwyneth Paltrow tries too hard to act badly in a pathetic effort to seem funny.  However, the shot of her tearing her skirt, to give her legs freedom to run, is the one part of the movie I thoughly enjoyed. <br /> <br />The much-touted resurrection of the deceased actor Laurence Olivier, as the villian, was a total cop-out.  They simply used his head in \\"Wizard of OZ\\" style which is something that wouldn't have been such a great technical achievement even in the pre-CGI days. <br /> <br />The actor who plays Dex seems catatonic and I wish Michael Gambon, who plays a cameo in the film, would stop trying to convince us he can now truly speak like an American after his disastrous turn in a TV movie as a British-accented Lyndon Johnson.  And I wish Angela Jolie wouldn't have tried to do the opposite by trying to sound British. <br /> <br />Although this movie will undoubtedly make money, I hope it will mark the beginning of a collective audience realization that these special effects are just getting old and will never be a substitute for a great story and good filmmaking.  A Saturday morning cartoon with a $70 million budget is not my idea of a good movie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's take on American Life evokes feelings of shallowness, emptiness, and desperation. The first three tracks on the album focus on what Madonna believes to American's obsessions with material goods, fame, and fortune.  <br /> <br />1) American Life - The first single and title track of the album features Mirwais at his best. Featuring Madonna as a rapper, the track pokes fun at American values and attempts to wake us up by exposing our hypocrisy. Even if the song doesn't change the minds of young Americans it has an ultra-catchy chorus and an even catchier intro. (Plus she says f+ck) <br /> <br />2) Hollywood - The second single from the album attacks American views about fame and fortune and attempts to expose the truth about glamour. The song is very easy to get stuck in your head and has an amazing dance flavor. (Plus it has the ultra kick +ss line: How could it hurt you, when it looks so good) <br /> <br />3) I'm so Stupid - Even though this track is probably my least favorite on this cd, it has a certain quality that is unfinished and very appealing. Also reflecting on American values, this track wraps up the three by admitting her own mistakes about what she thought was important in life <br /> <br />4) Love Profusion - This track is easily the best example of a pop song on the album. The track is light-hearted, up-deat, has wonderful surprises and goes thru different emotions and stages of being in love. This track gets the most air time on my cd player. (Plus its the Estee Lauder song) <br /> <br />5) Nobody Knows Me - Nobody knows how to make gay disco quite like Madonna. This track makes you want to get up, dance, and have lots of attitude. This track is inventive, creative, and Madonna doing what Madonna does best. <br /> <br />6) Nothing Fails - Noted by many fans to be the best track on the album, the song has beautiful melodies and a choir that alarms you. This song is absolutely breathtaking, but can also be a bit much to take on a regular basis. Even though this song was the third single, I was very surprised that it was chosen as a single because its not a typical song you would hear on the radio.  <br /> <br />7) Intervention - This track follows in the same vain as Nothing Fails in that it is also deeply spiriual. This track has an amazing hook that resembles something you would hear from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This song has beautiful lyrics and an honesty in her voice that makes anyone want to shed a tear. <br /> <br /> <br />8) X-Static Process - Like Nothing Fails and Intervention, this track also revolves around the concepts of spiritual enlightenment. This track is completely acoustic and is one of Madonna's finest achievements of the past 20 years. The track is bold, honest and absolutely an emotional journey. <br /> <br />9) Mother and Father - Even though this track begins as a simple dance tune, the song quickly develops into a reflection of her youth. Focusing heavily on trying to escape from her past and let go of her feelings of anger and pain revolving around her mother's untimely death, the track is powerful and very climatic. <br /> <br />10) Die Another Day - Even though this track originally premiered on a James Bond Soundtrack, the song fits beautifully on this album. Primarily speaking about breaking one's own ego and living on your own terms, the track fits well near the end of an album which heavily speaks put about American values. <br /> <br />11) Easy Ride - A clear ending and wonderful track to American Life with. The song is clever with simple lyrics and complicated instumentation. The production on this track is probably the best on this cd and has some interesting breaks in the music. <br /> <br />Overall American Life is an album you will either love or hate. This album isn't for everyone, it is deeply personal and isn't quite the typical pop album we expect from Madonna. Even though some of the tracks have definite radio potential, this album is bold, honest and definetly something that takes more than one listening.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Special Editions only on DVD? It's nice to see Mr. Lucas cares so much about the fans who made him a gazzillionaire. <br /> <br />These movies changed the lives of myself and millions of others in my generation - but because of Lucas' ego (and apparent disgust for the classic versions of these films which we cherish), all we will ever have of these films are a trio of fading videocassettes and our own (now betrayed) fond memories! <br /> <br />I, for one, will not buy these DVD's - I've contributed my last dollar to the ungrateful Mr. Lucas' evil empire...

I don't think a single day has gone by in the eight years we've been running The Digital Bits that we weren't asked: \\"When is Star Wars coming out on DVD?\\" We've struggled to answer that question as best we could of course, constantly checking with both 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm. We've repeatedly tried to convince George Lucas himself to release these films on DVD, eventually succeeding in getting at least the prequel films on disc (after a LONG campaign with other websites in which we jointly collected over 30,000 signatures and took out a full page ad in Daily Variety). But as to the ultimate question of when Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi would be released on our favorite format, Lucasfilm's answer was always \\"eventually\\". Well... eventually has finally arrived, hard though it is to believe. <br /> <br />The Star Wars Trilogy arrives on DVD in the form of a new 4-disc box set, containing not only the much-loved movies, but also a separate disc of all-new bonus material. So let's take a closer look, shall we? We'll start with the films themselves. <br /> <br />As most of you know, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space. It seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil Galactic Empire and the freedom-loving Rebel Alliance. Luke longs to fight for what he believes in, but the conflict is raging a long way from his far-flung world... at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncle's farm. Luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a Rebel princess, intended for a wizened Jedi Knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who happens to live nearby. The droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Unless these plans can be safely delivered to the Rebel forces, their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all. So with the help of Kenobi and a wise-cracking pirate named Han Solo, Luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life, pursued all the while by the Empire's most sinister agent of evil... Darth Vader. <br /> <br />It's really unnecessary to say much more about this film, as you're all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now. Released as a lark in 1977 by 20th Century Fox, George Lucas' original Star Wars became a hugely successful blockbuster almost overnight and it quickly changed the landscape of Hollywood filmmaking, not only reviving a long-lost cinematic genre but also pioneering the field of movie visual effects. The film had an incalculable impact on mythen ten-year-old life, opening my eyes to the possibilities of the film medium and firing my imagination like nothing before it. I'm certain that, like me, most of you have a very special place for the film in your hearts. But Star Wars today is somewhat different than you might remember it from 1977... or even the 1997 special edition re-release. <br /> <br />As you may have heard, a number of new digital changes have been made to the Star Wars films for this DVD release. As with the 1997 special edition, A New Hope has received the majority of the attention. Many shots have been altered in very subtle ways, which only the most zealous fans will notice. There are, however, a number of more major changes. In A New Hope, these include a revised opening shot as Luke's landspeeder enters Mos Eisley Spaceport (the speeder model is more detailed and moves more naturally), an improved version of the Han/Greedo fight (Greedo still shoots first, but only just - the blasts are much closer together and Han's movement is smoother), a new CG model of Jabba the Hutt (it's a revised version of the Episode I model of the character and is much improved) and re-rotoscoped lightsaber blades throughout the film (blade color is more pronounced and the animation is more like the prequel films). Personally, I quite like most of these changes. The Han/Greedo fight is still less than perfect, but it does look more natural. Han's head doesn't jerk like it did before - instead his whole upper body shifts over slightly. And the blaster shots are VERY close together now, so the encounter is not as implausible as it was in 1997. I still wish George would just let Han shoot first as he did originally in 1977, but I can at least stomach watching this scene now. <br /> <br /> <br />Three years after the release of the original film, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back continued the epic adventure. After successfully destroying the Death Star, Luke and his Rebel friends have been pursued across the galaxy by Darth Vader and the Empire's mighty space fleet. While hiding out in a new secret base on the frozen planet of Hoth, the Rebels are discovered by Vader. After a massive snow battle, our heroes barely escape with their lives and are scattered across space. Luke finds his way to the jungle planet Dagobah, where he begins training to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, Han and the princess find refuge on the planet Bespin, unaware that they've been followed by Vader's forces. Soon, Luke must abandon his training to come to his friends' rescue, ultimately risking his fate in a reckless confrontation with Vader himself. <br /> <br />Widely considered to be the best of the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back tells a much darker and more personal story than the original film, despite the inclusion of several dramatic action sequences. In a risky move, this unconventional sequel sees the good guys basically getting their asses kicked from the start of the film until the very end. It's not a happy or upbeat adventure by any means, and it ends with a stunning and unforeseen twist that left theater audiences hanging on the edge of their seats for more than three years after its original release in 1980. Despite the cliff-hanger ending (or perhaps because of it) Empire ranks easily among the best film sequels of all time. It holds up well to this day. <br /> <br />The digital changes to Empire for this DVD release are fewer than they are in A New Hope. In fact, there are only three major changes. These include the use of Temuera Morrison as the voice of Boba Fett (which I suppose makes sense given that Boba is a clone of Jango from Episode II), the elimination of Luke's scream when he jumps to escape Vader on Cloud City (which had been a source of much debate among fans - why would he scream if he were jumping willingly?), and the use of actor Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor (replacing the old woman and voice actor Clive Revill who played the character originally).I should note that the Emperor alteration also involves a change in the scene's dialogue - one that is at first confusing. The Emperor now tells Vader that he has no doubt \\"the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star\\" is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker, to which Vader replies \\"How is that possible?\\" That doesn't seem to make sense, because we know that Vader is aware of who Luke is from dialogue earlier in the film (\\"That's it. The Rebels are there. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.\\"). I suspect, however, that we'll find out in Episode III that Anakin DOES learn of Luke's existence as an infant, and he hides this knowledge from the Emperor. What that would mean is that Vader's been waiting all these years to find Luke as an adult and turn him to the Dark Side so that they can overthrow the Emperor together - a plot Vader ultimately confesses to Luke at the end of Empire. We'll have to wait for Episode III to see how this new bit of dialogue fits in. <br /> <br />Concluding the original trilogy in 1983, Episode VI - Return of the Jedi opens as Luke, now a fully trained Jedi Knight, returns with his friends to his home planet to rescue Han Solo from the vile crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke then revisits Dagobah and learns that he must ultimately confront Darth Vader if the galaxy is to have any hope of peace. Luke also learns a surprising secret before rejoining the Rebels as they prepare for the final, decisive battle in the conflict between Rebellion and Empire - an all-out assault on the Emperor's second and even more powerful Death Star. <br /> <br />As the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi fails to be either as fresh as the original film or as surprising as Empire. Too much is predictable here (such as the appearance of a second Death Star) and too many compromises were made for the younger audience members (the very presence of the Ewoks, for example) which is especially noticeable after the more adult themes of the previous installment. That said, Jedi does manage to adequately complete the story arc of the original trilogy. There's nice symmetry with the way the character storylines are wrapped up, and there's enough action to keep the film interesting. I'll be curious to see how well this conclusion works in the context of the overall 6-film saga once Episode III arrives in theaters in May, 2005. <br /> <br />As with Empire, are three major digital changes to Jedi, all of which appear at the end of the film. When Luke removes Vader's mask to reveal his father's face, the eyebrows of actor Sebastian Shaw have been erased (presumably because Anakin's face will be badly burned in Episode III). Then, after the second Death Star is destroyed, when the film cuts to the various celebrations around the galaxy, Naboo is now included among the planets we see. Finally (and this is a big one), when the Force ghosts of Ben, Yoda and Anakin appear to Luke at the very end of the film, actor Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with Hayden Christensen (as he'll appear in Episode III). That's going to piss off a lot of fans, but it makes sense. I suspect the rational is that a Jedi's Force ghost is frozen in appearance at the exact moment of his or her death. Since Anakin Skywalker basically ceases to exist in Episode III (becoming Darth Vader), his ghost remained at that age. Yeah, it's a stretch, but hey... within the logic of the universe, it does make sense. Like it or not. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I've accepted that Lucas is entitled to change these films until he's happy with them. The fact is, he's been changing them since 1977 (for example, right after the first film was released and became a hit, Lucas quickly went back in and added the Episode IV - A New Hope tag). These new CG alterations are simply the logical continuation of his desire to overcome the technical challenges he faced when he originally made the films. I have to tell you, I'm as surprised as anyone to find myself actually appreciating most of these changes. With the sole exception of the Han/Greedo scene (which still bothers me, although less now than as it was in 1997), I think all of the changes are either genuine improvements or simply make sense given the ties to the prequel films. I still think Lucas has a responsibility to save the original versions of these films out of respect for the fans who have supported them all these years, the artists who creatively invested themselves in the original work, and as a way to remind us all just how far the films have come since they were first released. And I still have hope that we'll see those original versions released on disc... eventually... in a more elaborate box set of the entire saga. But more on that later. <br /> <br />So that's the films as you'll find them on these new DVDs. Now let's talk about the DVDs themselves. Click to the next page of the review and I'll tell you all about it. <br /> <br /> <br />Part Two - DVD Presentation Quality & Extras <br /> <br />  <br />The most important part of any DVD presentation is the video and audio quality of the film itself. So how do the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs stack up in this regard? <br /> <br />Simply put, the Star Wars films have never (and I mean EVER) looked this good before. The films presented on these discs absolutely sparkle, in all their anamorphic widescreen glory. The folks at THX and Lowry Digital worked for months to create new high-definition digital masters of these films, transferred directly from the original negatives. Once the films were transferred, painstaking efforts were made to clean the digital masters of dust, dirt, scratches and excessive grain. To give you an idea of just how much work was involved, more than 100 bits of debris were digitally removed from EACH FRAME - ultimately entailing the removal of over 10 million such blemishes in all over the three films combined. As a result, you will not find a single speck ANYWHERE on any of these films. The snow-white slopesof Hoth and the sand-baked dunes of Tatooine have never looked so pure. <br /> <br />Because the transfers were done from the original negatives, you're going to see detail in these films that you've never seen before. You'll notice this right from the opening shot of A New Hope, when the Star Destroyer chases its quarry over the surface of Tatooine. Just look at the subtle swirl of could patterns on the planet below - astonishing. Best of all, not a lick of added edge enhancement was required to bring out this detail. What else is good? The color palette here is more lush and accurate than ever before. You're going to be blown away by everything from subtle flesh tones to the vibrant gold plating on C-3PO's chest to the bright orange flightsuits of the Rebel pilots. Contrast is also spectacular, with deep detailed blacks and clear, accurate whites. All three films in this set are just going to absolutely blow you away, and the bigger your screen the better it gets. The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is the best excuse you're ever going to have to go out and buy yourself a good anamorphic widescreen display. Until true high-definition arrives, it just doesn't get better than this. <br /> <br />On the audio side, all three films have been fully re-mixed in true Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX. The dynamic range in these mixes is impressive - everything from the softest passages of John Williams' signature score to the most explosive moments of action will full your home theater space with natural, immersive sound. The mixes are packed with atmospheric fill, active panning and surround play. The matrix-ed EX center back channel is nicely active - you'll definitely be glad you have an extra speaker back there, believe me. Dialogue is at all times clear and the LFE will really give your subwoofer a workout. These audio mixes are an absolutely appropriate match to the near perfect image quality. The sonic experience of these films on DVD will floor you. <br /> <br />As with theprevious DVDs for The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, each movie disc features there different menu sets themed to the various planets visited in the film. These appear at random when you boot up the disc (although there are codes you can use to see specific sets - see the Easter egg guide on the previous page). <br /> <br />In terms of extras, each movie disc also features a full length audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew. For all three films, George Lucas provides his thoughts on the overall themes and concepts, as well as interesting anecdotes on the characters and production. Actress Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) chimes in as well with her thoughts and shares some particularly funny behind-the-scenes stories about working on the films. Sound designer Ben Burtt discusses his audio work and the creation of various sounds for each character, vehicle, prop and environment. And Dennis Muren addresses the elaborate special effects work. For the Empire commentary, director Irving Kershner joins this group to provide his insights on the making of the film. As with the The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones commentaries, the name of the person talking will occasionally appear at the top of the screen to help you identify them. I don't want to spoil anything here - you've all been waiting so long for these DVDs that it's just better for you to experience it all yourself. Just know that the commentaries are fascinating and absolutely worth listening to. <br /> <br />The majority of the extras in this set are contained on its fourth disc, appropriately titled Bonus Material. This opens with an animated menu that depicts the Falcon flying through the asteroid field in Empire (you eventually end up in the Falcon's cockpit to make your selections). I should also note here that nearly every item on this disc is presented in anamorphic widescreen video - a very nice touch. <br /> <br />Arguably the most important bonus feature on the disc is Kevin Burns' 151-minute Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy documentary. Burns was given full access to the expansive Lucasfilm Archives and was able to uncover hours of behind-the-scenes footage from the making of these films that you've definitely never seen before. The documentary begins with Lucas' original idea for the films, then covers the development, pre-production, filming and post-production of the original Star Wars in tremendous depth. Burns' idea was to take you back to 1977, to relive not only the struggle that was the making of the original film but also the film-going climate into which it was ultimately released. You are there are at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, waiting in line to see the film for the first time. You actually get to see the original version of the opening crawl, sans the Episode IV - A New Hope tag (and it will give you chills to see, believe me). You get to hear from absolutely everyone involved in the making of these films. Over 40 new, in-depth and original interviews were conducted with all the major cast members, the production staffers, etc. They're all here to give you their thoughts on the films. <br /> <br />The first hour of Empire of Dreams is devoted exclusively to A New Hope, and then the remaining time is split between the making of Empire and Jedi. As I said, you're going to see things you never knew existed - footage of the cast clowning around on the set, a couple alternate versions of scenes from the films, plenty of production artwork and still photos - you name it. Irving Kershner tells a great story about how the secret of Luke's parentage was kept hidden from the cast, crew and fans. It's pretty amazing stuff. The documentary does drag a little bit once you get past the first hour, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it and you'll probably watch it more than once if you're a fan. <br /> <br />Also on this disc are a set of three production featurettes. The Characters of Star Wars tellsof the development of each character within the story and how each major role was cast. This includes some great, never-before-seen video of actors who tried out for the parts but didn't get them. Can you imagine Kurt Russell as Han Solo? Cindy Williams as Leia? William Katt (yeah... The Greatest American Hero) as Luke? It's fun stuff. <br /> <br />The Birth of the Lightsaber addresses how the traditional weapon of the Jedi came to be. We get to see rare video of fight rehearsals and on-set raw footage (without the blades rotoscoped in). Ben Burtt tells you how he came up with the sound, etc. Again, good stuff. <br /> <br />The Force is with Them: The Legacy of Star Wars looks at the influence the Star Wars films have had on Hollywood filmmaking (and filmmakers) as a whole. It features new interviews with the likes of Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and many others as they each talk about how the success of these films affected their careers and their work. <br /> <br />Fans of Star Wars minutiae will be pleased to learn that a whole gallery of rare theatrical trailers and TV spots for each film has been included on this disc, each in anamorphic widescreen video and presented in quality you've never seen before. There are also galleries of original poster art for the films, as well as a gallery of rare production photos. The production photos are very cool to see, but they're also a little frustrating because they include images from many deleted scenes we've all been waiting to see for years. That's all fine and good... except none of these actual scenes are included on the disc. That's right - you will not get to see Luke and Biggs on Tatooine from A New Hope, the Wampa attack from Empire, or the sandstorm from Jedi. The fact that they're not here is deliberate and tells you something else - they've been held back for inclusion on a more elaborate special edition release of these films in the future (I actually have word from sources that Lucasfilm is already planning the high-definition box set of the whole 6-film saga, possibly for the original film's 30th anniversary in 2007). It shouldn't come as any surprise that more elaborate special editions will eventually be released, but I found the lack of deleted scenes here to be irritating and I think others will as well. It's a major strike against the extras on this set.  <br /> <br />There are three other cool extras on this disc you'll want to check out (and others many of you won't give a rip about). The cool stuff includes a long-awaited sneak peek at the forthcoming Episode III. This takes the form of a featurette on the return of Darth Vader. We get to see the production staff building the new Vader costume, actor Hayden Christensen talking about what it's like to don the familiar black helmet, and Christensen and co-star Ewan McGregor practicing the infamous lightsaber duel that will climax the film. I think it will get you sufficiently pumped for the last Star Wars film ever... at least enough to hold you over until November when the teaser trailer for the film will arrive in theaters. <br /> <br />Speaking of trailers, as with the previous Star Wars DVDs, these discs include DVD-ROM weblinks to an exclusive online site where you may get the first look at additional footage from these films, the Episode III trailer, etc. <br /> <br />The other cool extra is a nifty Easter egg hidden in the bonus disc's menus. Like the previous DVDs, \\"1138\\" is the code to unlock it. When you do this successfully, you'll be treated to a funny gag reel from the original Star Wars films (see the Easter egg guide on the previous page for instructions on how to access it). I should also note that two of the aforementioned production featurettes on this DVD have funny little moments during the credits that you'll enjoy as well. <br /> <br />What's left on this disc is the not so cool, by which I mean the marketing fluff. This includes a trailer for the Star WarsBattlefront Xbox game and a preview teasing the making of the forthcoming Episode III videogame. I frankly don't care about either, but I suppose some of you out there will. It's also worth nothing here that if you put this disc on your Xbox machine, you'll get to play a complete preview level of Star Wars Battlefront. Again, I couldn't give a rip, but I'm sure some of you will appreciate this. <br /> <br />So that's the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, circa 2004. The films themselves definitely look and sound better than you've ever seen them before, and there are enough little (and not so little) tweaks and changes to each one to either thrill you or make you want to pull your hair out (or both). The extras on this 4-disc set are generally quite good, with the exception of the marketing material and the lack of deleted scenes. None of it is truly great, but it's certainly good and worthy of your time. Going through these extras, you definitely get the sense that what's been included here is just the tip of the iceberg, and that much more elaborate special editions of these films are likely to find their way to disc in the years ahead. Given the long wait to get these films on DVD... well, no DVD release could probably be equal to that level of anticipation. Still, with picture and sound quality like this, it's pretty easy to justify the purchase price for this set. Throw in the documentary and the audio commentaries, and it's really a no-brainer. <br /> <br />After all my bitching and moaning about getting these films on DVD over the years... my occasional tantrums and frequent soap box proclamations... am I finally a happy Star Wars fan? You know, I don't even know what the words \\"happy Star Wars fan\\" mean anymore. But am I secretly giddy that I finally have these films on DVD? Yeah, I am. I hate myself a little for it, but such is the curse of Star Wars geeks everywhere. No matter how angry and jaded I get, I still get chills when that logo crashes across my screen and that familiar John Williams fanfare blares over my speakers. Yeah, I got a bit of the goosebumps when I found out that Episode III was going to be called Revenge of the Sith. And yeah, I'll go to whatever crap movie the Episode III teaser trailer is attached to just for a couple minutes of eXtreme geek-out time. Don't even try to pretend that a lot of you don't feel the exact same way. We're a pretty pathetic bunch aren't we? <br /> <br />Anyway, I hope you all enjoy these DVDs. God knows you've waited long enough to get them. <br />

B0000C8AVI|2.0|The music is good, his voice is still that lovable, scratchy drawl, but there's something different...the lyrics are awful. This is his second album from his born-again christian stage. Leave this one alone, skip it, don't even bother with it, unless you can completley ignore the lyrics and focus soley on the music and his voice. \\"What God has given us, no man can take away\\" - Precious Angel. Arghh! <br /> <br />Go to Blood on the Tracks, or Blonde on Blonde. Some older stuff. Leave this alone.

0004704746|4.0|While the Harper-Collins edition is nicely laid out and a comfortable size, it is incorrectly called a &quot;complete&quot; collection. It is based on the 1951 Alexander text, which does not include either Edward III or The Two Noble Kinsmen. This edition contains the orthodox canon of yesteryear. With a limited selection of support material included, the reader will have to choose whether it's not worth spending the extra for a more comprehensive edition with expanded notes, glossary and supporting descriptions.
B00009MGQL|5.0|I have to admit that I had a problem with Beck experimenting with techno ideas because I am not a fan of this type of music.  It has taken me a long time to understand there are some really cool ideas to glean.  That being said, this album totally blew my mind.  Everytime that Beck has gone into a new area of music, his first few albums in the genre were worthy experiments, but were probably only of interest to die-hard fans.  For example, Rough and Ready and the Jeff Beck Group were precursers to Beck's getting involved in Jazz-Rock ideas on Blow by Blow and Wired.  In Beck's techno period, I would place this in the Blow by Blow category.  20 years from now, people will look back at this album and be amazed.  There are so many cool sounds and ideas imbedded in this album.  I would seriously recommend listening to it through headphones.
037571457X|5.0|This autobiographical graphic novel is a story of growing up in turbulent modern (1975-1983) Iran. This period had seen the communist movement, the overthrow of the Shah, the Islamic revolution, and the Iran-Iraq war. It corresponds to the author's age between 6 and 14. The author (born in 1969) looks back at this period with circumspect sensibility, and subdued emotions. The book gives life to a real human being -- a daunting task, given the prevalent one-dimensional prototyping of Iranians as terrorists and/or religious fanatics. Overall the illustrations were surprisingly expressive, and the storyline moving. I can't wait till I lay my hands on its sequel. The author is bound to grow up an intellectual.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I got these movies a week early so here's my review.  These movies look brand new -- there's a digital perfection to every image.  The downside is... there's very little emotion and nothing to engage you.  While the effects are startling, the digitized colors feel both rich and fake at the same time.  They don't \\"feel\\" like the movies I've grown to love. <br /> <br />The new scenes -- Lucas has destroyed the finale of jedi with new bad special edition music and having Luke looking on a ghost father younger than himself (Hayden Christensin), which makes very little sense.  The new fast cutting of the final ewok village detracts from the reunion of friends who have made it through thick and thin. <br /> <br />To his credit he fixed the bad jabba in star wars and got rid of the dumb scream in empire when luke tumbles down the vortex at Bespin. <br /> <br />But these movies have lost the fundamental emotion Lucas created.  Let's hope he puts the originals on DVD's.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I have never seen such a vampire movie before. I have seen the Interview with the vampire tons of times but I am so impressed. Tom Cruise plays Lestat so well. He is cruel and beautiful. Brad Pitt is an awesome Louis, he acts so well, and he is the most beautiful man in the world. And I think the other actors are great too. Sorry for my English, I am Hungarian. I don't really like other vampire movies for example Blade, Underworld (I love vampires but these movie are not really about the REAL vampires). Recommended movie!!!!
B000002G9S|4.0|If you are unfamiliar with Free, this Free CD and Highway are their two best.  You may also want to check out Heartbreaker.  The best songs here are \\"Fire and Water\\", \\"Alright Now\\", \\"Remember\\" and \\"Oh I Wept\\".  All four have the classic Free \\"thump\\".  A word of caution, stay away from the anthology CD \\"The Free Story\\" the remaster of \\"Fire and Water\\" disgraces the original version.  For some unforgiveable reason the song fades right as the awesome drum solo is just kicking in.  The song also sounds as if Paul Rogers was singing inside of a echo chamber, which ruins the song even more!   <br />This CD is a steal at the used price listed, buy it and enjoy some great rock and roll.  Paul Rogers is at his best here.
0743454529|3.0|This book is courageous, original and timely - with cloning, stem cell research and manipulation of embrios, a book about a daughter \\"genetically engineered\\" to provide spare parts for another daughter who is terminally ill is as timely as one can get.  There is a strong underlying ethical dilemma in the deliberate production of a human being for this purpose, and this book deals with it in an interesting way. <br />For the genetically engineered daughter is also a human being, a fact that her family seems to overlook until she sues her parents for the right to stop donating body parts to her dying sister.  The dilemma of the daughter, who feels guilty, scared, and defiant, the parents, impossibly torn between the lives and well-being of two children, the brother (the other overlooked child of the family) and the more distant relatives makes a fascinating study. Also, the struggle and suffering of the family was poignant - I was especially moved by the hospital dance.  <br />Also, the lawyer in the trial struggles with a disability of his own, shown by the poignant yet humerous example of his service dog and others' insensitive reactions to it.  \\"Here's the Braille menu.\\"  \\"You don't look blind.\\"  His ability to face his condition, at the end, added a special touch to the book. <br />So why three stars? <br />Well, first, the ending.  I understood the symbolism in it ***WARNING, SPOILER AHEAD***, (the daughter designed to sacrifice body parts to the other daughter makes the ultimate sacrifice) yet it just didn't work here.  Especially the bit about the sick daughter suddenly becoming \\"all better\\", the father's brief drinking problem, the problem brother becoming a policeman, etc - I found myself just muttering \\"sure, sure\\".  Also, as other reviewers have said, it felt like a teary \\"movie of the week\\" cop out to avoid addressing the real issues. <br />Second, this book was full of filler.  Brian, the father, was a likeable character, but he yammered on so much aboutthe stars, fires, etc, that I soon ended up automatically skimming the parts where he was the narrator.  The \\"moving lines\\" at the end of each section were overdone and tedious.  Finally, the romance between Julia and the lawyer was boring, overdone and detracted from the main theme of the book.  I wanted to know more about Anna and her feelings - not factoids about astronomy, or some woman who let a long-ago high school crush dictate her life.  There was too much distraction in the book, and not enough of the real story.  For this reason, it was hard to really relate to Anna - she seemed distant, cold, a bit cruel, and half-drawn in the story. <br />In conclusion, this was a good book, and wiht a lot of editing and tightening of the story, it could have been great.
B000002OCP|4.0|According to the liner notes of the four-disc Led Zeppelin boxed set, bassist John Paul Jones came up with the basic riff for Zep's song \\"Black Dog\\" after being inspired by the album Electric Mud.  This definitely piqued my curiosity, so I decided to hunt down the much-maligned Muddy Waters' album-a recording that has been decried by blues purists since its release over thirty years ago-to check out what Electric Mud was all about. <br />I admit, I also was kind of taken aback on first listen.  This thing is pretty far removed from Muddy's rollicking Mississippi Delta-meets-the-Windy City output from the 1940s-50s.  It also isn't like latter albums from Muddy's canon, such as the Johnny Winter-produced Hard Again (a classic, by the way, with some of the best musicianship ever put down on wax.  Buy it.)   <br />In actuality, this isn't even a \\"Blues\\" album, per se.  The \\"Blues\\" merely serves as the framework for this weird dayglo fantasy where some pretty talented musicians let their \\"freak flags fly.\\"  <br />But, I still like Electric Mud because it grooves hard. In fact, what truly anchors the whole record--and what makes it work ultimately--is the rhythm section backing Muddy.  From the opening break of \\"I Just Want To...\\" to the last bar of \\"The Same Thing,\\" Morris Jennings (drums) and Louis Satterfield (bass) lock in the groove so tight that even the sometimes gruesomely off-key, fuzzed-out warbling of electric guitars over the top can't derail the freight train.  (Just try not nodding your head to the beat on \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\\" or \\"Mannish Boy.\\")   <br />That said, even the guitar work is somewhat impressive at times, if for no other reason than its mix of gritty soulfulness and wild psychedelia.  (Check out the Stones' \\"Let's Spend...\\" or \\"Herbert Harper's Free Press News\\" for examples.)   <br />What's more, I disagree with the criticisms that Muddy sounds kind of lost in the midst of the wah-wah guitars and other psychedelic trappings.  In fact, there's even a quote from blues legend Buddy Guy in the liner notes that asserts, \\"Muddy can't feel this psychedelic stuff at all...\\"  To me, Muddy sounds as forceful as on any of his other records.  He also sounds like he's having a ball.  (Just listen to him vamping and clapping along during \\"Let's Spend...\\" if you disagree.) <br />So, if you're looking for something closer to Highway 61, this ain't it.  This isn't even South Michigan Avenue.  This is more like some spaceship landing at the imaginary crossroads of Carnaby and Haight streets: Some spaced-out, alien version of Muddy Waters struts out with patchouli oil in hand ready to funkify and \\"turn-on\\" the hippy kids to the fact that Muddy and his contemporaries had, for all intents and purposes, invented the music that groups like Cream and the Yardbirds were peddling at the time... <br />Take it for what it is: A funky little time capsule from 1968.  And just enjoy it. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|Give me the originals anyday. Why mess up a good thing? If its not broke, dont fix it....
B0000B1OE7|4.0|Normally anime shows would be boring if they just put in  \\"shoot-shoot bang-bang,swish-swash,GAAAAH!\\" for no reason and the story would really suck.But for Ninja Scroll, it's an exception. It's action packed,ultra violent,and it is just plain cool. Not to be sick or anything,but seeing the characters decapitated and all bloody was quite awesome. <br />Drawbacks well the story is quite dull. Basically it's good against evil battles and that epidemic. Second like every anime DVDs' it's kind of pricey,$30-$40 for a 90 minute movie. And sure there's widescreen format but really the price antes up for that? Nonetheless Ninja Scroll is a great anime if you need some action.
B0000844IT|4.0|In this third and final installment in The Evil Dead series Sam Raimi shifts his horror movie into an Action Adventure type movie. Bruce Campbell brings his best acting into the final movie. The film also brings laughter to the screen just like the first two. Get ready for Ash's final wild ride in his 73 Olds mobile taking on the deadites in the 13th century while trying to get the book of the dead to send him back into his time. It will entertain you from start to finish. Go buy this great Boomstick edition to add to your collection.
B00028HBKC|2.0|I am not a Christian and I cannot say that I particularly enjoyed this movie, even though at times it really made me think. I have long thought that Christianity is a tool of mass control and psychological manipulation. The Passion really gave me the sense of Christianity as the worship of the killing of god and the worship of the ascendancy of man. With the gross amount of genocide, pain, and suffering that Christianity has been responsible for, as well as the respressive contributions it has given Western Society (not to mention the fear driven obliteration of indigenous societies), I really believed that it has served the purpose it was instiutionalized to serve. Think about it.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The best thing I can say about this 3rd Matrix movie is that it made me appreciate the 2nd movie much, much more. <br /> <br />So much promise, so little follow through... sigh. <br /> <br />What we really need to see, is not the \\"extended director's cut,\\" but rather a version that takes the best elements (this would NOT include the George Lucas-like visit to Zion with all it's council meetings, endless discussions and dancing Ewoks...) of these last two movies, cuts out all the Jar-Jar stuff and leaves us with one kick-ass two and a half hour sequel to the Matrix.
0142004235|1.0|I was surprised that this book was written by Steinbeck.  For high school, I had to read this book during the summer and I had to put it down in the first few chapters. It didn't seem real and Cathy (the main women character) is so cold and evil.  It is a dark novel that will make you cringe and throw up-well that's how I felt.  The novel shows the worst in people through the characters.
B00006GA4C|4.0|\\"Serious\\" music journalists generally hated this kind of stuff. \\"The music is too ham-fisted and the lyrics are hopelessly cliche and socially irrelevant\\", they self-righteously argued while clinging to their worn out copies of \\"Trout Mask Replica\\". Meanwhile, these same critics were drooling over solo-era Lou Reed lyrics that read as if they were penned by a troubled third grader. To an extent, the critics were correct. Grand Funk comes across like a pissed off, mentally retarded dinosaur heavily into weed, chicks and muscle cars. But that's really the beauty of it! The early-70's were all (okay, mostly) about big, bloated, dumb and heavy rock and roll and Grand Funk Railroad was its chief ambassador. <br /> <br />Forget that \\"The Red Album\\" contains no earnest acoustic guitar balladry or poignant socio-political \\"observations\\". Mark, Don and Mell didn't have time for that touchy-feely crap! They wanted to rock! And rock they did. <br /> <br />Humor aside, GFR were actually very good musicians and very good at what they did: super heavy power trio thunder. That's why this CD is so fun to listen to. It consistently rocks the whole way through. Credit must also be given to producer (and swindler) Terry Knight for faithfully capturing the band's raw power in the studio. You just don't hear record production like this anymore. Knight, recognizing how integral Mel's earth shaking basslines were to the band's sound, wisely featured him prominently in the mix. Add Don's dry amd heavy drums and Mark's super raw guitar heroics and you have the complete picture of a band who were out to take no prisoners. Some Nixon-era headbangers even put their bongs down long enough to discover that GFR recorded a song called \\"Paranoid\\" a full year before fellow knuckle draggers Black Sabbath did. While Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" is rightfully considered a classic, GFR's may actually be heavier.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|The Evil Dead is a great film for any horror fans. This movie delivers the Gore and the Comedy. This movie has alot of mistakes in it but only because it was a super low budget film. This film brings every horror fans dreams come true. It takes you on a crazy ride that is very fun and entertaining. All hail Sam Raimi for creating this film.His idea was fresh and delivered something that people had never seen before. What is even better than this is its sequels. Its well worth your money.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|an excellent sophmore cd if ive ever heard one, obviously this is dominated by eminem, but can you blame him? hes still one of the best rappers out there.  this is a fantastic album with lots of good songs.  and for those of you who think my band is probably the best song on this....think again, it is a great song, dont get my wrong, but \\"how come\\" and \\"loyalty\\" are WAY WAY better, then you ahve \\"b*tch\\" and \\"Get my Gun\\" and \\"git up\\" as amazing songs...the rest is mostly filler with the annoying skits, i ignore them totally, but the songs themselves, for the most part, are worth listening to.  Personally i love this cd and give it a 5.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Didn't expect the film to end where the main character gives up something that he really wants just to see other people have a better life. Niiiice! Would have got 5 stars if it weren't for the profanity.
6305428050|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago- incidentally I am 55- perhaps a bit old for this movie? Nah. <br />Elizabeth Shue is cool as Chris who is stuck babysitting a little \\"Thor\\" freak and two teen age boys after she is stood up by her errant boyfriend(who,of course, gets his comeuppance). <br />Her ditzy,nearsighted girlfriend is stuck at the downtown Chicago bus station. Penelope Ann Miller is great as the friend,Brenda, who has hysterical adventures after her glasses are filched. <br />At any rate, Chris bundles up the kids and heads to Chi town with the kids in her Mom's station wagon. A flat tire, a tow, and a fight between the tow truck driver and his wife's boyfriend lands them hiding in a car. Everything's O.K. now, right? Wrong! Calvin Levels(playing Joe Gibbs, who looks like a male Whoopi Goldberg) is heisting the car. He tries to help the kids but is forced to help find them when they rip off a Playboy with important info; then the bad guys chase them, and it's a hoot, especially when they have to sing the blues, then run into Thor. Want to know about Thor? Watch this very funny movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore does have an agenda...and I agree with his agenda...VOTE BUSH OUT! <br />If you know anyone that is undecided then you have to get them to see this movie. <br />Unfortunatly, the people that really need to see this movie won't and I am sure that next year we will all be watching a new Michael Moore movie on how the Bush Empire rigged the election again. Jeb and W have their team ready to do it again this year folks....and this time we better be ready to fight back! <br />
6305841861|4.0|The sequel to the original Evil Dead kind of takes it in a different direction. This is actually a remake of the original so don't get confused with the beginning of the film. The movie is actually more of a comedy than horror. The acting is alot better than the first one.And Sam Raimi kind of learned from his mistakes from the original.It still has errors but is much better. Evil Dead 2 has less gore than the original but is more entertaining than the orignal. You will enjoy it just as much as the original. The ending to this will leave you wanting more.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The stupidest argument I hear from pro-special edition people is that George Lucas couldn't stand the originals and wanted to make them how he wanted them, that's just rediculous, many artists hate what is generally considered their best work, Anthony Burgess never understood why people liked 'A Clockwork Orange' so much, he made it just to pay the bills, Tchaikovsky despised 'The Nutcracker Suite', and John Lennon generally disliked everything the Beatles did. I originally didn't mind the special editions, I didn't like them, but I figured I didn't have to watch them, I still had the old ones, but now George Lucas is trying to rewrite history and make it seem like the originals never existed. When you release a work of art, it then belongs to the public, when you take it away, it's like stealing, George Lucas stole the Star Wars Trilogy from us.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie ROCKS A$$! I bought this for my B.F. as a B-day present this year and I loved it! The movie's about a young girl who is moving to a new house in a new city away from everything she's ever known. Not until her parents take an unexpected turn which was 'supposedly' supposed to lead them to their new home. Wrong. It actually leads them to an 'abandoned' train station next to an old theme park. The girl wants to go back, but he parents find an empty restaurant filled with delicious food, and insist to stay. While her parents eat, she explores Ther are empty buildings all around her, and she comes across a bath house. A boy sees her and tells her to take her parents and leave befor the sun sets. She does so, but not in time. She returns to the restaurant and finds that her parents turned into PIGS! They get taken away, and she runs back to the train station. Only she reaches a river that was not there when they first arrived. So she had to stay in this magical world she got shoved into, and takes a job at the bath house, where she tries to fet her parents back into humans. Not so easy.<br /><br />This movie is really great and really captures its viewers. It has a slight resemblance to 'Alice in Wonderland', and the ending is awesome. I really love the characters, especially the baby when it gets turned into a mouse. The movie has wonderful animation and music. Everyone should love this movie. Or you can \\"PLAY WITH ME OR I'LL BREAK YOUR ARM.\\"
B00005OWEG|3.0|I wish I had never seen this version of \\"Apocalypse Now\\".  Though the original theatrical version was not without it's flaws, the insertions here just drag down the proceedings.  What point was there in putting in the Playboy bunny scenes other than for titillation?  The French rubber plantation scenes may be Coppola's attempt to comment on colonialization but they just upset the rhythm of the film.  The only addition that makes sense here is the additional scene with Marlon Brando reading from \\"Time\\" magazine.  This scene illustrates how his character, <br /> Colonel Kurtz, is straddling the slippery fence of madness and sanity and makes his character more sympathetic.  Let me state up front that I feel that the original version of \\"Apocalypse Now\\", despite it's flaws, is a masterpiece and I would unequivocally give it 5 plus stars.  Despite the redundancies of \\"Redux\\" this is still a great film.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|this is a fabulous album. it was a great surprise that Ray Charles had recorded these wonderful selections with such a cross section of popular musicians. it is a joy to listen to and a wonderful gift from the \\"Genius\\". his sound never gets old and his ability to sing with artists who have vastly different approaches and styles proves what a genius he is. i find i'm singing the songs throughout the day. icredible!!!
0316666343|1.0|This book starts out fairly intriguing, but this only serves to heighten the sense of disappointment which follows.  For a book about death, grief and the afterlife it is incredibly shallow and trite.  Susie's heaven is empty and depressing, and the 'climax' is idiotic.  Apparently the most meaningful thing the author can come up with is a couple of teenagers hopping in the sack.  I find it hard to believe this book was written for adults.
B00005JN7O|5.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is an evolutionary experience. Movies have never been like this; but they should be! The visual intensity is nearly unbelievable. The Fictional Universe of the story took on a dream like quality do to the production methods. The whole movie seemed more real, more believable, because of the `memory' like elements used to produce it. The soft edges, and brush stoke quality of the characters blurred the lines between \\"live action\\" and \\"blue screen\\" creations. With any luck movies will move in this direction from henceforth. The evolution of the movie has been a long time coming but with the appearance of \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" that evolution is here now.  <br />  <br /> <br />
B0000U5RNU|1.0|Not a single laugh!  Rowan Atkinson has great talent, but it is wholly wasted here.  The script is hopelessly inept.  This is a model of poor film making.
B00005JN7O|4.0|Looking back in time you would think the Americans of the 1920s and 1930s were nuts when it came to concepts of the world of tomorrow. To many scientists of the modern day, these \\"visions of the future\\" are clumsy, primitive and nave but to young children, and even some older readers, these were a form of escape from the less-enthralling realism of the post-World War I depression era that consumed the country at the time. Science would soon blend with the comic-book/science fiction world creating such astounding superheroes as Superman, Flash Gordon, and Buck Rodgers. This concept would eventually spill over into the realm of the movies, spawning now classic films such as The Invisible Man, The Island of Lost Souls, King Kong, and many more. Today, we look back upon these films, often laughing at the now amusing concepts and clichd situations, but at the same time feeling a bit nostalgia for a time when things seemed, at least in our minds now, a bit simpler then they are now.    The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow takes the futuristic visions of the world as dreamed up in the science-fiction comic books of the 1950s and brings them to life in brilliant style and texture. Though the world seems brighter and better then ever after the horrible events of World War I and the Great Depression, danger still loams on the horizon. Scientists, who were part of an underground doomsday project created before the outbreak of the First World War, are mysteriously disappearing from across the world - six have already been abducted, with the seventh highly aware of his dire situation and looking for safe haven. He soon comes into contact with the ambitious Polly Perkins, an adamant reporter for The Chronicle, and tells her the identity of the mastermind behind a serious of raids on the city conducted by gigantic mechanical robots - Dr. Totenkopf, the same devilishly brilliant scientist behind the organization of the doomsday project. After receiving this startling information, she then pays a visit to an old friend, Sky Captain and his mercenary fighter pilots known as the Flying Legion, who may be the world's only hope from absolute destruction. The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is more then simply a vision of \\"the future that never was\\", at least outside the realm of comic-books, but offers an enthralling storyline combined with a rousing musical score, entertaining performances, and stunning action sequences, all balanced together in a well-formulated film-noir style of filmmaking. Is it jammed packed with clichs and unrealistic situations? Of course it is and that's what makes this film one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, namely for the fact that those clichs are actually used to help it achieve a level of entertainment that is so rarely seen in modern cinema.    Another keen move by first-time director Kerry Conran was to enlist as few high profile performers as possible in order to keep the actions of the film centralized on the two leads, namely Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Though some may have dispute with some of their past performances, kudos must be given to these two for carrying this entire experimental project on their shoulders and for doing it as ideally as they did. Jude Law fits flawlessly into the role of flying ace Sky Captain and pulls off a performance reminiscent of Harrison Ford's in the Indiana Jones series, though with far less prestige and anticipation then Ford's signature role. Even the character himself gives off the suggestion that he might be a direct takeoff on the famous archeologist but perhaps that's what makes the movie all the more attractive and ultimately more enjoyable. Gwyneth Paltrow also gives a commendable performance, though slightly less savoring then Law's but, then again, that was expected considering he is the hero of the film. And Michael Gambon, who recently took over the role of Professor Dumbledore in the immensely popular Harry Potter series, makes a slight appearance in the film as the editor of the Chronicle. His character isn't exceptionally important to the overall storyline but it was just good to see him on screen once again, at least for those who enjoyed the Singing Detective television episodes. There are two minor complaints when it comes to the area of performances in this film: the first being the most blatantly obvious one, that the actors frequently gave some stilted, wood-like performances in particular sequences, but this was to be as expected after the some-what bumbling work that appeared in Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The other issue being the role of Angelina Jolie, more specifically the character of Franky Cook. Whether this is the fault of the advertising department or the filmmakers, Jolie's role was built up as this prominent co-starring role when in actuality it's nothing more then a mere cameo. One can say that they may be holding up on the character in order to broaden her role in any sequels, or quite possible prequels, should this film prove to be a success. These two aren't what would be called \\"deal breakers\\" for this film; rather they are just minor annoyances that merely need to be addressed.    Overall, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow rattles the box office from its usual post-Labor Day slumber and brings about an experience that can best be described as this generation's Raiders of the Lost Ark. The feature's obvious draw will be its astonishing special effects (seriously, the entire film is done in computer animation, with the exception of the actors of course) but thankfully the film relies on a cleverly-crafted script to back it up, rather then depending on a one-trick pony to simply get butts in the seats. Some individuals may go into this film with the impression that it will end up being nothing more then a clichd special effects extravaganza and, in one respect, they would be right but what separates this film from the rest of thetrash that has been cluttering the movie theaters for the past few weeks is that Sky Captain has created its own separate identity and hasn't simply cut-and-pasted ideas from the competition. The script, though not absolutely believable, does what it's suppose to do and that's namely to entertain audiences without going so over the top so that it becomes ridiculous and not worth your time. And what could one ask for more then a villain who comes off as an extremist social-liberal wacko who believes mankind is doomed to destroy itself and should be punished for ruining the planet and filling the world with hatred? Sure this guy may be a god to the left-wing fringe of the Hollywood elite, namely everyone but Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis, but we all know better. Should this film prove to be a success at the box office, it would not be surprising in the least to see this bud into an affluent franchise in the not too distant future, something of high demand from the movie-going public with The Lord of the Rings now done and over with and Harry Potter possibly on the ropes. Bottom-line, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be everyone's cup of magnesia milk but for those tired of sequels and the same old tired retreads, this is the film for you.
6305736650|5.0|I've probably seen this movie more times than any other, and I'll keep watching it, year after year.<br /><br />A lot has been said about Casablanca, so all I can add is my personal impressions. This movie is black and white. Even if color had been available, black and white would still have worked better. The scenes, the closeups of people, they all have some some monumental quality, some kind of skill that's been lost for decades, now. The personalities also stand out in black and white - a resistance hero, a man without a country, a cheerfully venial functionary. Even the DC-3 in the last scene is the icon of a plane, F-15s and 747s not withstanding.<br /><br />No one can claim to be literate if they haven't seen this movie, no more than if they haven't heard Beethoven's Ninth. At the time, this movie was just one among many churned out assembly-line style. Something in it captivated people, though, and keeps captivating them today.<br /><br />Whether or not it's your first time, be captivated.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002LPD|1.0|C'mon man. If you're buying this album you got problems. Van Halen used to be good. Just let go like I did and accept the fact that Van Halen is not the same band as it used to be. Alex doesn't drum the same anymore,Eddie doesn't play like he used to, Dave is gone so the song writing isn't the same, and Mike Anthony is just there. In my opinion anything after \\"1984\\" sucks and just continues to get worse as the years move on. If you don't believe that you're living in denial.
0316776963|4.0|i have really come to appreciate the type of humor i find in david sedaris books.  he really has a way of saying a phrase that is completely hilarious but if he said it in a conversation it would really sound matter of fact.  i love the way that he puts his thoughts down on paper it almost resembles a stream of consciousness type of style.  i also admire the way he sees people, and i think that i relate well to the writing because i often see people in the same way he does.  i dont feel like it is a dislike for all people, but rather a questioning of how do some of the people of this world continue living from day to day.  the writing style is excellent and very readable.  his stories are all humorous and it is quite interesting to view his world for a while because there are some people that could only dream to live a life as interesting as his.  like always there is the same interesting mix of characters, and by characters i mean his family.  the last story of the book about his father and the rotten food is quite amusing.  the second to the last story is also very funny but with an underlying serious tone to it.  the seriousness involves the task of kicking destructive habits and the funny part is how sedaris pretends to be other people with grand accomplishments.  finally, the funniest story i found was the first in the book, it deals with his childhood problem of a lisp and his multiple trials with his speech therapist.  the links he went to in order to avoid the letter s are very inventive and amusing.  this is a very solid book and worth the read as is all of his other works.  always approach these books with an open mind in order to really enjoy and when you do you are sure to have a good time.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|This CD completely BLOWS! Avrli Lavigne Lacks any real talent, all she does is strum her guitar while songwriters feed her the words to sing, i'd rather kill myself than listen to her horribly awful voice
B000002MIB|1.0|This album gets 1 star because ZERO wasn't available. This is not the Van Halen I knew growing up. I personally think Van Halen should've tired after \\"1984\\" came out and when Dave quit. At least we could've remembered them as a good rock band. Now I have to defend Van Halen by telling people they were actually good at one point in history pre Sammy Hagar. Hate me if you want for writing this review- but you know it's true. This album sucks big time. Eddie and Alex don't even sound good anymore. Alex's beats aren't interesting anymore and sound all the same-SERIOUSLY!! I love early Alex and Eddie- but this is wack!!!!
B000059ZLH|3.0|<br />I feel that the corny effects is annoying. Most people who buy this dvd will be watching it over and over and over again simply for the music. but guess what, everytime you watch it over, you're gonna have to see the damn story line played out everytime! It takes away the rawness of the show.  <br /> <br />Yes the sound is too low, but you can still enjoy it. I mean come on, most of us either watches it from a computer or their living rooms. the sound is fine for what it's worth! <br /> <br />This is the first time i've seen dream theater, first time hearing them, and first time for me to really listen to \\"progressive\\" rock.  <br /> <br />With that said, I feel that dream theater made their music so complicated and difficult it's almost impossible to play along! Most of the songs are choppy (as if there were 20 songs put into 1 song). The song has no particular pattern, it seems like the singer is just coming up with melody right at the spot. <br /> <br />Again, the little movies in between songs just annoys the hell out of you when you watch the dvd. It's KINDA cool when you watch it the first time, but after that, who cares????? <br /> <br /> <br />Along with this dvd, i also ordered john petrucci \\"rock discipline.\\" I feel that Petrucci is less of a player compared to satriani and vai. His solos just arn't as wild and sometimes they're boring. <br /> <br />So far, the only DVD that is by the far the best, would be \\"cunning stunt\\" metallica. but then again, metallica has similiar songs, so that's a yawner.  <br /> <br />every dvd concert out there has their flaws! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM! \\"cunning stunt\\" is prob. the best! too bad it's metallica and not steve vai or satriani.

B0001MDP3G|1.0|It was needlessly dirty, boring, and stupid.  A deserter is not romantic.  He should be shot.  What ever, i have better things to review so, once again, this movie sucked.
B00005JN7O|3.0|I had good expectations for \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" and was looking forward to seeing it ever since I saw the first preview. It seemed like a highly original, entertaining flick with a great story to go along. While it definitely succeeds with the former, it fails big time with the latter. <br /> <br />This movie has some of the coolest, most innovative special effects you'll ever see, there's no question about that. I was nothing short of impressed with the CGI, not to mention the cool \\"retro\\" look portraying a futuristic society in the 1930's. Basically, this movie had everything it needed to be great: an all-star cast, big budget and stunning visuals. But unfortunately, a lousy script and hollow story take away its full potential, to the point where it cannot be overlooked. Let's start with the script. There were several instances where people in the audience laughed out loud at the contrived, silly dialogue from the characters. Not all the script was bad; but what wasn't downright lame was only mediocre, so that's not saying much. And then there's the story. Equally as mediocre and uninspiring. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out. The audience is never given the chance to really care about them. Just when you think there might be some character development, a CGI battle sequence comes into play. They were certainly impressive, but there has to be a balance somewhere. And oh yeah, there's also some shameless product placement (Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum, I think Double Bubble as well) although it's not as bad as \\"I, Robot.\\" <br /> <br />In terms of performances, everyone is adequate, considering that they were simply \\"acting\\" in front of a blue screen. The always reliable Jude Law does the best he can with the script he's given to work with. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good although her performance comes across as campy at times. Angelina Jolie phoned this one in, that is, during the whopping 15 minutes that she's actually in the movie. So for any Jolie fans, know that you won't get to see much of her. <br /> <br />I wanted to like \\"Sky Captain\\" a lot more than I did. I'm a fan of every actor and was hoping that they could carry it. But the lack of an intriguing plot and disposable script were a disappointment. This movie plays out more like a comic book, and perhaps that's what it should have been instead. It's got plenty of excellent eye candy, and if that's the only reason you go to movies then you'll surely enjoy it. But for anyone else who expects and hopes for a good story to go along with it, you'll probably leave the theater feeling uninspired. \\"Sky Captain\\" is not a bad movie, far from it. It has its merits. It's just not as good as it could have been, with all it had going for it.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|What a waste that they could have such a cool actor and actress and stil make this movie suck!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I stumbled on Madeleine Peyroux quite by accident, a friend told me about this cover version of Cohen's Dance me...  <br />I wasn't prepared for what I was about to hear, it felt like hearing Billie Holiday singing, again. I was totally taken in and captivated by her voice. Oh I know one shouldn't compare singers, but she can surely stand on her own. A wonderful album, if it took eight years from her debut to make this one, I'll gladly wait eight more for the next, if the result comes anywhere near this. And to those of you that feel Jazz is not yer cup of tea, forget Jazz, this is music at it's best. <br />Her name is Madeleine Peyroux, and boy does she know how to carry a tune, to make it hers.
B00005JMAH|1.0|This movie was so bad when my dad wanted to see is again, i had to say no.  I dont know where to get started, it was boring, fake, and really made up.  Worst camera and cinemetography ever.  Horrible acting and directing.  I dont know, but i say this movie  sucked!!!   <br /> <br />JK RETARD probably feels like crap from firing the guy from the second movie which was actually pretty good.
1400032717|5.0|I read this book with essays and homework for various classes looming over my head... but I still couldn't put it down! Mark Haddon narrates from the perspective of a 15yr old boy with Asperger Syndrome (a form of high-functioning autism), and does a phenomenal job. Because of my experiences babysitting a young boy with this same disorder, this novel truly hit home. Christopher (the narrator) lives in a world that suddenly turns on its head; his ways of coping with these abnormalities may seem weird to the average reader, but he explains himself in such a way that these quirks become logical. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but I'll restrain myself =-] . All in all, read this book as soon as possible! It allows you to enter a foreign land and meet a deep and extraordinary young lad, one whom you will truly never forget.

B000002OVJ|5.0|This is the rock equivalent of the battle of Britain, with the only battle going on is the Who vs. silence, and the Who win by a mile!  <br />This is the greatest rock live album (by anyone other than the Grateful Dead), but simply this is the most rocking live album.  <br />I've never heard any band open with a juggernaut like Heaven and Hell...I mean, this could be an encore, and yet if you listen to this song alone, it's still the greatest rock album f all time.  Can't Explain shows how a relatively simple pop song could be sooped up like putting a 'vette engine in a Pinto. Always loved the Stones version of Fortune Teller, but as Moonie says right before the first note \\"ours of course is the most important version\\" and he could have been right. The Who hit it right on solid with Tatoo, showcasing their diversity, and following with a blistering Young Man Blues, that is nothing short of legendary, and a fitting anthem for the times. <br />At one point Roger Daltrey says \\"it's nice to be playing in England again\\". Hell, if this was the case, they should have never left England, but thankfully they did. Whatever the case here, this was a band firing on all cylinders this night. How the one disc lp with the same name was ever released sans all the songs you get on this one is beyond me. Not previously included were the \\"hits\\" medley (you get Substitute, Happy Jack, as Townshend quips \\"our first number 4 and a scorching I'm a Boy)plus a display of the vocal prowess of A Quick One (while he's away) make this a true  tour de force. The version of Magic Bus just goes to show that the Who recorded music in the studio meant to be played live, whereas many bands tried to make thier studio work sound interesting when they played it in concert.  <br />There are many great performances of the Who live available out there, some worth getting if you can avoid the ridiculous price of bootlegs, but this is worth three times the cost. I never tire of this album in the almost 30 years I've owned it, and would almost personally guaruntee anyone who likes to hear people play their own instruments as a band playing music with power and finesse and intelligence will like this. The Who were a category all by themselves. This is quadrophenia squared....four guys playing like 16!  <br />One more thing...I saw the Who at the Garden in 2000, and it seemed like Townshend, Entwistle and Daltrey realized they may never play live together again, playing with a spark many in their 20's never find,  and these guys were on the verge of 60! The Who......God bless 'em.
B000274THQ|3.0|It was enlightening to see East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down depicted as a modest patriotic country in this warm amusing tale of a young man who goes to great lenghts to shield his mother from the unification of Germany. The already contrived comedic situatiion gets bogged down in the second half with the mother slipping in and out of comas and hospitals, her character becomes the picture of tragic consequences and robs the film of it's gentle light-heartedness. There is also a bit of clumsiness in the young man's infatuation with his long gone father and an East German astronaut, who apparently served as a father figure. The two characters look alike and, as shadows from the past, are seen as the same, lending a bit of confusion. Daniel Bruhl as the young man carries this film single-handedly with his undaunted determination to protect his mother but even his dynamic presence becomes a wee tiresome as his mother succumbs to illness. It seems this tragic angle doesn't absorb well into the hopeful texture of the film.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Kill Bill, Vol. 1 deserves fewer than 1 star. I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel. It's essentially a third-rate, high-violence, somewhat twisted Charlie's Angels. Two main problems. Unlike the Angels, Uma Thurman is not, in the least respect, attractive. The second problem--she can't act. She's simply a terrible actress. Can movies still be good even with bad acting? Sure. Unfortunately, Kill Bill still sucks for a number of reasons. I know it's an action movie, but even as far as action flicks go, this movie has a crap storyline. I know the special effects are \\"supposed to\\" suck, but that idea in itself kind of...well, sucks. Overall, have I seen worse films? Yes. But only two. Bottom line: If you appreciate skilled acting and cinematography, avoid Kill Bill, Vol. 1 at all costs. There's nothing for you here.
B00006JL1Z|2.0|save your money, sounds like it was recorded inside of a coke <br />can.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These are great movies and you must buy them this coming weekend! The new special effects I think will work when you see them, many people are complaining, but I think they will turn out nice. It is also a treat to have these on DVD and thats really cool. I also think that there will be more DVD editions of these film in the future. Lucusfilm and 20th Century Fox can make more money that way. I think that they will do what they did with each of the Alien movies (oh thats another great sci-fi series to check out!). Once \\"Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith\\" arrives on DVD and video Fox will release an Alien Quadriolgy type boxed set for these films. And also release them sepertly. This mega boxed set will include \\"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace\\" regular and special edition, \\"Star Wars: Episode II- Atteck of the Clones\\" regular and special edition, \\"Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith\\" regular and special edition, \\"Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope\\" regular and special edition, \\"Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back\\" regular and special edition, and \\"Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi\\" regular and Special edition. The regular version would be the origional cut that was in the theater back in the 70s and 80s and nothing new added, and for the prequel films the origional version from the 90s and 00's. Now for the special editions, not the new movies from this set but the 1997 special editions, they are not on DVD either so they can also be included, as for the prequels they can just add deleted scenes since the effects are amazing already. Then add lots of features I know they have but just waiting for another addition to release them. So when you buy this boxed set and the \\"Alien Quadtiolgy\\" type boxed set you will have all three additions of the origional films. Then like the Alien films from the mega boxed set they were all released sepertly, as Collector's Editions, so then all 6 Star Wars films will be released under that title and everything is put to rest! Thats what I hope will happen but that might not be for years and years so i'll keep my fingers crossed! <br /> <br />Other classic Sci-Fi films: <br />\\"Alien\\" Series <br />\\"The Matrix\\" Series <br />\\"Star Trek Motion Picture\\" Series <br />\\"Back to the Future\\" Series <br /> <br />Oh also when your out buying the Star Wars Boxed Set make sure to buy \\"THX-1138\\" Lucus first movie and it to is remastered and special effects special effects are also new so make sure to pick that up as well and its classic sci-fi so pick that up as well.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|This is not a CD that follows the flow set by the first 4 CDs. This is the only Enigma CD that I don't like. I'll play 1-4 straight through and skip this last CD.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a VERY good Chili Peppers album. It contains a lot of keyboards and Strings, and alot less guitar riff only songs. Very good. Very Different. Warm Tape is a cool song.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Mystic River will either leave you in the dust, and perhaps for some, leave you asking why.<br /><br />The film rolls with remnants and echoes of other films I own. It has the pacing of \\"In the Bedroom\\", and towards the end, the same tragic spiral down effect of \\"Requiem for a Dream.\\" It's plotted in such a way that we are given one false clue after another (as in Bloodwork) keeping you on the edge of conclusion until we are at the last moment given a huge reveal that shatters everything we have learned prior. At the core, it's a woven tragedy.<br /><br />The acting is tremendous, as you have no doubt read about from many major critics. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and the often underated Kevin Bacon (check out \\"Stir of Echoes\\") are very dependable actors still deep into their prime. All of them do their part's more than justice, though other projects in their massive acting career's have had them in my opinion, at a more difficult level. (Dead Man Walking, Jacobs Ladder, The Shawshank Redemption.)<br /><br />I bought the three disc set of Mystic River specifically because I wanted the best edition out there. The video and sound quality are as good as I hoped for. The saturated filming is downright vibrant in its murkiness, the same way as Se7en. If you don't want to spend the extra ten bucks to have bonus material (though educational from almost every aspect), and the soundtrack then you should be happy with the single disc edition. (check out \\"A perfect World\\", Eastwood at his best.) Mystic River is a good story, and it is what it is. ~S.A.O.S~
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie pleasantly surprised me.  I didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br />First of all, I have to say Maggie's acting was superb.  The breadth of her character's range from weak to strong, simple to complex, and innocent to sensually manipulative, was amazing, far greater than I was prepared for. She starts out as a sad, sensitive, plain, frumpy girl who uses self-inflicting pain to deal with the psychological pain and stresses in her life. It helps keeps her from numbing out too much, and takes the focus away from the hurt in her heart.  She had been doing this for a long time, but an accidental severe injury put her in a mental care institution for a while, when it was thought she had attempted suicide. While there, she was able to find some self-esteem in learning secretarial skills. When released, she sought and found a job as a secretary with a quirky, anal, self-absorbed, demented, semi-genius loner of a lawyer who epitomized the term 'Control Freak'. <br /> <br />As a natural submissive, Lee fought harder to please each time she was debased and scolded over some small error she had done. Soon, it became a dance between she and her boss, with each of them creating excuses for him to discipline her.  As the relationship developed, so did Lee, becoming stronger as a person, and coming out of the shell where she had hidden her entire life. Although her boss was the dominant one, punishing her in erotic fashion, it was she who controlled the pace and action of the relationship. <br /> <br />There's a moderate amount of self-hatred on the part of her boss because of his behavior and outlook on life.  That prevents him from feeling good about where the relationship has gone. <br /> <br />When her boss understood he had lost control of their interactions and relationship, he fires her.  This leads to a showdown, with her boss making extreme demands in order to drive her away. Yet, Lee meets him head on, doing everything that was demanded of her, pushing herselfeven beyond her physical limits, to demonstrate both her love, and strength of the bond between the two of them.  That same intense bond that her boss was denying to both of them. <br /> <br />A crazy, erotic love story, with a breakout performance in a very unconventional role by a stunningly attractive actress I had never seen. <br /> <br />Can't say I was all that impressed with Spader's roll, but it worked well in conjunction with her work. <br /> <br />I found the message very appealing, that there's a chance for each one of us to find someone just right, no matter how different, kinky or weird we may be. <br /> <br />I recommend it highly for those who are comfortable with domination/submission. The story and acting performances were both delicate and powerful.  <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Day after Tomorrow was made, apparently, for one reason: To wow the audience with its special effects and for a few moments make us feel like we are also dodging tidal waves and tornadoes. In that way, for me, it succeeded.<br /><br />You can't approach effects vehicles the same way as hardcore drama's that are filled with the do's and do not's of life. You have to step back and ask: Do I care enough about these characters to worry whether they make it or not? I felt so. I am a massive Gyllenhaal fan, and can't wait for the day when Dennis Quaid gets to show off his true capabilities as an actor. (Check out \\"Frequency\\" or \\"Dragonheart\\").<br /><br />The Day after Tomorrow will no doubt become a show-off disc for my home theatre sound system, and for those who can be willing to have simple minded fun for a few hours this will be the showcase. Though I know some of the savor will be lost as far as scope, it will still be a good dvd to own. ~saos~
0385510438|4.0|I haven't been too impressed with Grisham's writing of late, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Last Juror.  Grisham's depiction of the rural south during the 60's and 70's kept me reading.  More than that, I found myself engrossed in the relationship between Ms. Callie and Willie and watching Willie, a \\"city slicker\\" become a beloved member of Clanton.  Sure, the book had a murder mystery, romance, etc., etc., but this book was more about the growth of an unlikely friendship and what can happen if we open ourselves up to the unexpected.  One of Grisham's best books since A Painted House.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|The soundtracks of the Kill Bill series succeed in what Tarantino attempted to accomplish: A mix of the Samurai Epic and the Spaghetti Western.<br /><br />The wide variety of sound brought forth on this platter will at the very least put a grin on your face. Its definitely a special mixture that ranges from the hyper get-in-your-head anthems of the 5's, 6's, 7's and 8's to the Karate Kid style pan flute of Zamfir. As everyone is entitled to a favorite, mine is the opening theme sung by Nancy Sinatra. Its a hauting, somber tune that I find myself singing out of the clear blue.<br /><br />A definite for lovers of Tarantino's unique mix of the senses. The enhanced version is by far the one to own. ~saos~
B0000C9JFO|5.0|I loved this movie. Not only does it present Barcelona (a city I am in love with) in its own right: a bit messy and chaotic, yet unique and special, like no other place on earth. The city becomes the people and the people, the city.<br /><br />Xavier (a funny French exchange student, played by Romain Duris) goes through the loops and curves that life places in front of him, going away from familiar Paris to come back after a year of sharing an apartment with six other Erasmus students, soaking up each other's culture and learning quite a bit about the opposite sex. He ends up finding his true calling in life, after having learned more about himself in a year than he had in the first 24 years of his life.<br /><br />Fun, human, touching and sexy: all these things are to be found in this International flic, to make it highly enjoyable.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Some people have a hard time accepting you can never go back, was I upset when Greedo shot at Han first? yes.  Was I annoyed when one of the most powerful scenes in Empire(Luke falling after Vader cuts his hand off) was ruined by a bad sound edit of a scream that doesn't even sound like Luke? damn right.  Do I have the right to complain about the changes Lucas decides to make in his movies?  NO.  Why?  Because they are George Lucas' movies...If you don't like the changes, don't buy it.  But remember that what makes Star Wars great isn't the nostalgia of looking back and remembering what it was like when you were a kid, Star Wars is great because (A)it's a modern myth (B) it's not a studio controlled franchise.  If you don't like the special edition/DVD changes, just try to imaging what the series would be like if George wouldn't have made the money to become independent.<br /><br />With that off my chest, I'll just say that I'm super-eager to see whatever changes George deemed fit to make in HIS films (that goes for THX-1138 too).
B00006AW2M|5.0|This is definitely the Stones' most rewarding listen.  Those who make negative comments about sacd, obviously have not heard them on a sacd player and obviously don't care about sound quality.  SACDs definitely have a richer sound quality and should be checked out by those who have a discerning ear.  As for the album, this seems to be everyone's least favorite.  This is the most creative piece of work the Stones ever put together, followed by Between The Buttons.  They experimented with psychedelia and succeeded.  I'm sure the problem is that this album did not sell as well as others or have big hits and so after this album, and especially after Brian Jone's death they totally sold out!  And obviously, that is what the majority of you wanted!
B00000IP3S|5.0|I'd been planning on checking out Blind Guardian for quite some time, but kept putting it off because of how crappy the euro-power metal scene is in general.  But some weeks back I listened to my Demons & Wizards album for the first time in quite a while, and was reminded of just how good it was, so I went out right away and picked this up.  Needless to say I shoulda done that a lot sooner.  As I anticipated, this album is way over the top, but in a good way, and is a helluva lotta fun to listen to.  Essential listening, for sure.<br /><br />The only real problem with this album is the production, which is pretty lousy. Way too muddy, and the guitars aren't loud enough.  But I can live with it, and this production is preferable to the hideous, bass-drum saturated over production that is typical of pretty much all the european power metal that I've heard.(which, admittedly, isn't all that much)  And, despite the muddiness, the mix has got lots of power and energy, particularly in the drums, which is probably more important, for a metal album.<br /><br />This is a truly epic album, with each song graced by a huge vocal chorus.  Fortunately, Kursch is a great singer.  The choral vox sound wonderful and always have great melodies, and I really like the harsher vox typically used during the verses as well.  They sound great individually and compliment each other very well.  Individually, the instruments aren't that exciting, due to the great emphasis on the vocals. But they do what they are required to do quite well.  The rhythm guitar doesn't have that many memorable riffs, but it's got lots of pulsing energy, and there are quite a few nice dual leads.  The drums are fairly conventional as well, but once again provide all the energy and power the album needs. Also, they manage not to overdo it on the double bass in either the production or the performance.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks on this album.  The title track is probably the best.  One of the most epic things here, with the best chorus on the album and great vocals throughout. Some nice leads too. The next track, I'm Alive, is probably the second best track.  It's got a strong speed metal element and the second best chorus on the album. Script for My Requiem is the most over the top song on the album, with just about the most absurdly over blown chorus imaginable.(Other than a few things on A Night at the Opera...) But of course, the weird grandeur of their music is what makes Blind Guardian good, so this is another strong track.  More energetic speed metal riffing at times, and I particularly like the vocal part just before the instrumental bridge after the second chorus.<br /><br />Well, I'm not gonna bother with any more track specifics, as I am certain to say exactly the same thing about each track. I like 'em all, though.  This is something of an acquired taste, so you might wanna try and test it somewhere before you buy, provided you aren't familiar with or don't care for the subgenre in general.  But if you wanna find something that takes the grandeur of prime Iron Maiden and Painkiller-era Judas Priest to the next level you want to get this.epic things here, with the best chorus on the album and great vocals throughout.

B000003CMC|5.0|\\"Eat A Peach\\" is The Allman Brothers Band's 1972 album that marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one for the band. Guitarist Duane Allman died in a tragic motorcycle accident during the making of this album so, \\"Eat A Peach\\" not only serves as Duane's swan-song but also marks the start of the band carrying on without their legendary co-leader.<br /><br />The albums opening three tracks are the ABB's first recordings following Duane's death. \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" is a solid Gregg Allman rocker with a light gospel touch to it. \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" is a 9-minute instrumental tour-de-force composed by guitarist Dickey Betts that has a slight Santana and jazz fusion feel to it. Betts does an amazing job tackling the Allman's trademark duo lead guitar style by overdubbing both guitar parts himself. While Duane Allman is ultimately absent on this track, his presence is definitely felt here. \\"Melissa\\" is a tender country-tinged Gregg Allman ballad which became one of the ABB's well-known hits. There is some great guitar work by Betts on this track as well.<br /><br />The next three tracks are leftovers from ABB's excellent \\"Live At Fillmore East\\" album and feature the full classic original line-up of the band. \\"Mountain Jam\\" originally took up two sides of the album's original double-vinyl and clocks in at an epic 33:38. Here, Duane and Dickey's dual guitars play off each other effortlessly while Gregg displays some flawless Hammond organ solos. While Donavan Leitch's \\"First There Is A Mountain\\" is mentioned in the credits as forming the basis for this long piece, there are also references to Jimi Hendrix's \\"Third Stone From The Sun\\" heard throughout it as well. Definitely a centerpiece for the entire album. The other live tracks are the blues-based \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Trouble No More\\", both of which have since become Allman Brothers classics and fan favorites.<br /><br />\\"Eat A Peach's\\" final three studio tracks are the very last ever recorded with Duane Allman. \\"Stand Back\\" is a driving blues piece which once again highlights Gregg's soulful vocals that deliver a sound reminiscent of Ray Charles. \\"Blue Sky\\" is another country-rock piece in which Dickey Betts grabs the spotlight as lead vocalist with his emotional singing. The closing piece is a poignant acoustic Duane Allman-penned instrumental entitled \\"Little Martha\\" played by Duane and Dickey. This short track serves as a fitting epitaph to Duane's musical legacy and seems appropriate since this was his final album with the band.<br /><br />Tragedy could not stop the Allman Brothers band as clearly proven with this album. The following year, they would suffer another devistating loss with the death of bassist Berry Oakley (also killed in a motorcycle accident). Even this could not halt the band as they continue to record and perform to this day. \\"Eat A Peach\\" not only contains some great music, it also serves as a fitting tribute to Duane Allman and points the Allman Brothers Band to their next musical chapter. The album also serves as a great companion to their \\"Live At Fillmore East\\" album as it includes some excellent performances from those classic concerts.<br /><br />Truly An Allman Brothers Classic!!!Stand Back\\" is a driving blues piece which once again highlights Gregg's soulful vocals that deliver a sound reminiscent of Ray Charles. \\"Blue Sky\\" is another country-rock piece in which Dickey Betts grabs the spotlight as lead vocalist with his emotional singing.

B000068TPN|5.0|When this film was first aired on sky movies i taped it and watched it.The first time i watched i wasnt so sure some scenes were just too horrific to watch and then i watched it again and the more i watched it the more i liked it and now its easily one of my favourites. Mel Gibson puts on a strong southern accent as Lt colonel Hal Moore CO of the 1/7th. The film is truely brilliant Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper give great performances and you really get connected with them and the rest of the characters its easily the best vietnam movie i ever watched and puts films like Green Berets too shame the ending is very solemn theres no sense of victory in it only of loss. Also unlike some other films it shows the enemy as human which in my view makes a a great war film you feel for the viet cong as much as you feel the US troopers i highly recommend this film but be warned its a very graphic film.
B000002UAX|5.0|My first impression of the White Album was rather mild. I bought the CD about the same time that I discovered the Beatles' later works. My father had been a big Beatles fan, and as a result I came to love them at a young age. However, he prefered their earlier works, so those were the ones that we mostly listened to. When I started listening to their later music, I instantly fell in love, and my reaction was to buy their later albums. <br /> <br />After I bought the album, I listened to it for about 40 minutes and then threw it in the bottom of my drawer. There was something about the album that didn't impress me. For about three years the CD remained in my drawer with packets of papers and magazines piled on top of it. I soon forgot about the White Album and listened to the other Beatle albums instead. Then, about seven months ago, I took the album out and decided to give it another try. After listening to the album in its entirety, I realized how amazing it really is. Every song is unique, and the album itself is an array of different types of music. Only the Beatles could record an album with such a mosiac of musical genres. Everything about the album is beautiful and in a way simplistic. It's no wonder that it's considered one of the greatest albums ever made.
B00005JN7O|5.0|\\"Sky Captain\\" should appeal to people who love pulp fiction and the serials of yesteryear like \\"Buck Rogers\\", \\"Superman\\", or their progeny, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"Star Wars\\".  I'm talking about people who haven't entirely lost their innocence or their ability to experience wonder.  Having seen it twice, I can safely say I think it is the best movie of the year.  As Ebert says, it gave me the same feeling I had when I first saw Raiders back in 1981, the feeling that made me say...WOW!  And a bonus--it's even more of a family friendly film than \\"Raiders\\" is! <br /> <br />\\"Sky Captain\\" is what movies should be all about...allowing us to visit the countless worlds of imagination and put aside the confines of reality for a little while.  I still get a lump in my throat when I hear the theme of Sky Captain coming to New York's rescue to save Gotham from the Giant Robot attack and feel the stirring call to action in the Sky Captain march that opens the film.  Only \\"Raiders\\" succeeded in moving me as much, and for Sky Captain to do so to a 44 year old tells one about the care Kevin Conran put into creating his cinematic vision.  Although there are a few nits in the script (the characters refer to World War I, yet there hasn't been a World War II since Nazi Germany doesn't exist in its alternate reality [they should have referred to it as the \\"Great War\\"]), I honestly believe most people will overlook them and just flow with the engaging story. <br /> <br />Jude Law's earnest performance (he's what heroes should be all about--man, do I want to be \\"Sky Captain!\\"), able support by Ribisi (as Dex Dearborn, boy genius) and Angelina Jolie (as sexy, slinky aviatrix Cmdr. Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook), cute, ribbing banter between Sky Captain and Paltrow's Polly Perkins, the spunky reporter who's the hero's former/future girlfriend (a definite bow to Lois Lane and Katherine Hepburn's 40's characters), and reverent bows to the classic movies of the 40s and 50s (look for Godzilla,Kong, and Atlantis in some of the scenes), really hit their marks.  I heartily recommend you see \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow!\\"  Trust me, your inner child will thank you for it. <br />
B00007AJF9|3.0|For those hoping for an educational shortcut into the life and times of Elizabeth I, this movie both elucidates and confuses.  It brings home nicely the conflict between protestants and catholics, and the fact that Elizabeth allowed many catholic nobles to remain in her court.  But the period suffered from having too many Marys -- Mary Tudor (daughter of Catherine of Aragon), Mary of Guise, and Mary Queen of Scots.  The last is by far the best known to most Britons of today, and this movie confuses by totally excluding her.  I'm not a historian, but I spent most of the film assuming that Mary of Guise was another name for Mary Queen of Scots.  So I was perplexed when she was murdered in her bed, rather than beheaded at Fotheringay.  The failure to mention Babington or David Riccio also meant that another two of the principal characters of the era were omitted.  It would also have been nice to see the plot include  the suspected murder of Dudley's wife (in which Dudley and Elizabeth herself were implicated).<br /><br />But historical omissions aside, this is a sumptuous portrayal of the era, and a great means of getting people intrigued to discover more. (I went on to buy Michael Wood's IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE as a result, for example).<br /><br />Cate Blanchett, who isn't English, performs the title role magnificently, by the way.  And in this film, she's not required to help a single hobbit.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A dying Richard Farnsworth gives the performance of his life as the dying Alvin Straight--a simple (but far from simple-minded) man who wants to put right as much as he can, and take one last long look at the world, before he moves on.  If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then it probably isn't--this is the kind of movie that you really have to be in the mood for, and for which some people never are.  I happened to see it after a tough week of work, struggling to fix things that really shouldn't have been my responsibility and dealing with duplicitous managers who seemed to spend most of their time shifting blame.  This gave me a wonderful sense of relief from my own stupid little problems, and some perspective about what really is important.
630542845X|5.0|I loved this movie.  The story of an outcast Jeremy/Powder, an amazing yet somewhat creepy character.  When his preggant mother carries Jeremy/Powder inside her she is stroked by lighting, she then gives birth to electricity itself.  Jeremy/Powder is made of electricity and raised by his grandparents who were infact afraid of him.  They both die when Jeremy/Powder is a teen. He is then taken from his beloved home by a headmistress of a troubled boys school and she finds that he is a most unique boy. Jeremy/Powder discovers the pain outside of his home and sees the terrible truth about the place he was born into.   <br /> <br />The way this movie makes you feel after the movie and even in some of the scenes like the dieing deer scene, the \\"Friends don't...\\" scene in the councilor's office and the scene when Jeremy/Powder helps the sherif's wife comunicate.  Those are the kind of scenes that make the movie unforgetable.  The performance of Sean Patrick Flanery as Jeremy/Powder was amazing .  This movie is one of my favorites at the moment and I would definately recommend it to almost anyone.
B000005J56|4.0|I don't need to listen  the intromissions of that Ry Cooder in the CD, the best part of the album are the astounding cuban musicians. I'd surely give Five Stars to this CD if that Ry Cooder were not in here. <br /> <br />I just can't bear how the Amazon site states that this album is by that Ry Cooder and a band called Buena Vista Social Club, please, be fair, be smart, this album is by Buena Vista Social Club and some guy whose name (Ry Cooder) people barely knew until he \\"teamed up\\" (yeah right...) with the Buena Vista veterans.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I certainly am not about to jump on the bashing-Sofia Coppola bandwagon. It is such an inviting opportunity to trash this movie -- as critics trashed Sofia Coppola's acting, in her role as Mary Corleone in father Francis Ford Coppola's \\"The Godfather, Part III\\" -- because the director is the beneficiary of her father's nepotism.  Well, that is undoubtedly true, but I honestly think she made the grade with this alright movie. (To go out further on a limb, even though her acting was not good in Godfather III, she was believable as Michael Corleone's daughter. I don't necessarily think that would have been the case with Coppola's first choice, Wynona Ryder, even though Ryder is a better actress). Thankfully, nepotism exists, because I think without it, this movie could never have been made. Although it is indeed a worthwhile movie, there are way more talented people out there than Sofia Coppola who can't even get that so-called \\"friend of the independents,\\" Robert Redford, to give them the time of day.    The movie revolves around Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), an oddly matched pair, alienated from the superficial glitz and glam of the Tokyo film and fashion world. Like two lost children caught in a snowstorm, they find each other, and seek warmth and meaning in their friendship. Through random meetings and seeing the sights of Tokyo, they end their time together a little stronger to face the world.    A number of reviewers criticized this flick because \\"nothing happens.\\" No, nothing \\"momentous\\" does happen; that is not the point. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is a quietly told story of, to paraphrase Thoreau, two souls living in quiet desperation. Which is exactly why this story takes place in Tokyo. All right, \\"they're in the middle of Tokyo, and all they do is stare at the walls.\\" Precisely. They are depressed people, and often, depressed people are more intelligent than those around them. They need cerebral stimulation, not merely the obvious sensorial stimulation offered by the Ginza's fury of neon.    Most certainly, I was thinking Bill Murray was nuts for not having an affair with the ethereally beautiful Johansson (who is my second choice candidate for playing Madeleine, if a remake of \\"Vertigo\\" is in the offing; my first is Kirsten Dunst). Yet, many of us have had a friendship that, even though both parties are interested sexually, is far too precious for sex to intrude upon. A paradox, I know, but true nonetheless.    The film had a minimalistic, beautiful story, played by both actors with insight and understatement. I give the actors 4-1/2 stars.    That said, this was hardly a cinematic feast.  My reaction to the cinematography was simply neutral. It makes for a better play than movie. Some people are tossing the phrase \\"Italian Neorealism\\" around rather haphazardly. Please!  As a piece of film, \\"Lost in Translation\\" is to \\"The Bicycle Thief\\" or \\"Stromboli\\" what \\"Body Heat\\" is to \\"Double Indemnity\\" and \\"White Heat.\\" Close, but no cigar. As a work of cinema, I give it 1-1/2 stars. Thus, 3 on balance.    Nevertheless, I hope to see more of Sofia Copolla's movies. I believe that if she studies the fine art of montage, she'll go from being a so-so director to a great one.     She can start by viewing the works of her father.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|Do you what the three biggest mistakes in the history of rock & roll were?    1) John Lennon leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Yoko Ono.    2) Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles to make albums with the inferior Wings.    3) Alan Parsons leaving behind his fans to make an inferior album of lifeless dance tracks, barking dogs, and baby noises.    This almost matches John & Yoko's Two Virgins as the most horrible and unlistenable album I have heard in 30 plus years as a rock fan. Major jeers to Alan Parsons for selling out after such a long string of excellent melodic music. Will he ever make good music again? This is so bad that I doubt it. Let's hope that the Moody Blues & Jethro Tull aren't next. After this disasterous letdown anything seems possible.
B0000033J9|5.0|Maurice Jarre created a sound-track classic-for-all-time . . . and for all times with the soundtrack for the 1965 film \\"Dr. Zhivago\\".  This was an epic movie of an epic love and demanded an epic musical score. This soundtrack transcended that demand. While it was the perfect accompnyment to every scene of the film . .  .it stands on its own as well, even now almost forty years later. <br /> <br />The recurring \\"theme\\" - \\"Lara's Theme\\" (popularly known as 'Somewhere My Love'- as lyrics were added for pop radio) is today, instantly recognizable to everyone. (I can't hear that theme without \\"falling in love all over again\\" with Julie Cristie, who played the role of Lara - or who WAS Lara!) <br /> <br />Another memorable track is the \\"Kontakion\\" from the Kievan Russian Orthodox Requiem Liturgy. This hymn is emotionally moving in every Eastern Orthodox funeral or memorial service for the dead . . . it was just as emotional in the film setting as the young boy Yuri (Zhivago) attends his mother's funeral and interment. Just listening to the track today, brings memories of that scene . . . and to any Orthodox familiar with his/her own spiritual tradition, evokes prayerful memories of every funeral of any loved ones who have departed this life. This track alone makes this disc worthwhile owning. <br /> <br />This 1995 \\"Thirtieth Anniversary Edition\\" is expanded to include much music hich was not included on the oiginal 1995 release . . . all of it worthy. Also, three variations of \\"Lara's Theme\\" (not on the film score) are also added \\"bonus tracks\\" - one jazz, one rock, and one swing -- all interesting and enjoyable, though out of the film context . . .but they demonstrate just how adaptable and viable \\"Laras Theme\\" actually is and can be. (I must admit that the \\"rock\\" version sounds more like \\"Dixieland to my hearing.) <br /> <br />This is a more than worthwhile album to own and to listen to over and over again. Even if you never saw the movie,\\"Dr. Zhivago\\", you will enjoythis album . . . and maybe even be inspired to read Boris Pasternak's book . . . and maybe even get a copy of the film to watch . . . again and again . . . and possibly fall in love with Julie Christie (Lara). <br /> <br />(p.s. - Boris Pasterak actually meant this \\"love story triangle\\" to represent being torn between the love for \\"Mother Russia\\" with the \\"Czar\\" and \\"The Revolution\\" and all that it entailed and hoped to build for a new Russia and all that Revolution ruined and destroyed . . . Zhivago, Tonya, Lara, Strelnikov, Komarovsky are all \\"symbols\\" of the love/longing/strife/war of Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Russia.)
B0002IQHY8|3.0|I have to say that I've read the previous reviews for this album before doing this review and am NOT surprised that there is a bit of division amongst AP fans with respect to this latest release. I, like a lot of reviewers of this album here, am a huge Alan Parsons fan.  I have all of the APP studio albums as well as of the post-Project era albums (live or studio). <br /> <br />This album is definitely different from past releases from AP.  Gone is not only Ian Bairnson (guitar) and Stuart Elliot (drummer) but also long time contributor Andrew Powell (both his playing and his orchestra). <br /> <br />Alan Parsons has definitely chosen a different path for this album by actually contributing his own musicianship (ie. lyrics and music) to the album instead of relying solely on others (like Bairnson, Elliot and long time APP member Eric Woolfson).  <br /> <br />The instrumentals are incredible on this album.   Return to Tunguska is a phenomenal beginning to the album with Alan's \\"electronica\\" talents put to full use as well as hearing the great riffs of legendary guitarist David Gilmour (Pink Floyd).   Mammagamma is redone and passes as a modern day sound of the old classic (my only knock is that Alan may have overdone the \\"electronica\\" on this one!) <br /> <br />Tijuaniac and L'Arc En Ciel are great pieces of work. The programming done for these pieces are phenomenal and of course Alan Parsons' contributions on keyboards are great. <br /> <br />Perhaps the best instrumental on this album, in my honest opinion, is Chomolungma (which, as many people know, is Mt. Everest).   Here, Alan, his son Jeremy and PJ Olsson wrote a stunning instrumental with great programming techniques thrown in, amazing keyboard playing by Alan Parsons, and the \\"haunting\\" chants of \\"Miyo Langsangma\\" (who by the way is the goddess of Mt. Everest according to Nepalese tradition) by both Alan Parsons and PJ Olsson.  Chomolungma delivers a strong finish to this album. <br /> <br />Albeit said, there were some parts of the album that I did not like.  The lyrics on this album I felt were the weakest of all the releases that Alan Parsons has done.   Gone are the days of the clever lyrics from APP and the Bairnson-Elliot eras.  The lyrics on 'A Valid Path' seemed very amateurish, \\"dummy-down\\"ed, and very \\"Mickey Mouse\\".   More Lost Without You instrumentally was great, but sad in terms of lyrics.   We Play The Game is awful, boring and tedious both lyric wise and music wise (sorry Alan, I think the world of you, and I know you wrote the lyrics and most of the music, but this track stinks!).  You Can Run is the worst and perhaps the most pathetic attempt of a track from both Alan Parsons and David Pack (who has contributed on Alan Parsons' Try Anything Once album with The Three of Me and Oh Life - two unbelievably great tracks). Truly a disappointment for those familiar with the \\"Try Anything Once\\" album.  The remake of the Raven (called A Recurring Dream Within a Dream) is way overdone in terms of \\"electronica\\" and should have been left alone.  I never thought a classic song like \\"The Raven\\" could be destroyed by AP, but he found a way to do it! <br /> <br />So, like reviews with 5 stars and 1 star, this review has a bit of both.   If you like the instrumentals from Alan Parsons in the past, you'll like this.   However, the new songs with lyrics are not \\"Parsons\\" good and are a huge disappointment. <br /> <br />Summary:   Instrumentals \\"two thumbs way up\\"....the rest of the album \\"two thumbs down\\" or \\"two middle fingers up\\" depending on the track in question. <br /> <br />The album is worth getting for just the instrumentals and nothing else!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I wasn't even planning on reviewing this movie. It's merits are so self-evident that reviewing it here seemed superfluous. After reading a handful of the ridiculous comments others have written, however, I changed my mind. The two films Christopher Columbus (of Home Alone ignominy) directed are slavishly devoted to the books on which they were based. The results are excremental regurgitations of Rowling's material. They are lifeless, joyless things with nothing to offer a discerning viewer, although they apparently double as a cheap babysitting service to prudish parents with no aesthetic convictions.  <br /> <br />If Prisoner of Azkaban failed to break box-office records, it's because fans of Rowling's books have been disappointed too many times in the past. This is a shame because Alfonso Cuaron's film is the only one (to date) worthy of its source material. His willingness to depart from the text results in a fresh and entertaining film that completely captures the spirit of Rowling's book. Cuaron is a director perfectly suited to the task presented by this film. He has worked with small children in the past with incredible results (see \\"A Little Princess\\"), and his coming of age story \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" is one of the smartest films made in the last ten years. In Azkaban, Cuaron uses his considerable talent to great effect. He humanizes all of the stale characters he has inherited and gets his extremely talented cast to turn in commanding performances. The transformation of starlet Emma Watson is only the most obvious example of his success in this regard. Alan Rickman finally gets screen time in the third film, which comes as a welcome change. The new additions to the cast are all superb - including Michael Gambon tasked with the thankless job of replacing the late Richard Harris. Gambon slips into the role of Dumbledore. Instead of doing his best Harris impersonation, Gambon plays the Hogwarts headmaster as an aging eccentric cryptohippie which is just fine -even if it does force some reviewers to confront the bourgeois prejudices of their class conscious children.  <br /> <br />Cuaron's film is full of unexpected gems. If you're a micro-managing Potter purist you might be bothered by the fact that Hogwarts has some surprises you aren't expecting. But if you're a fan of movie magic, you'll be swept up in this film and you'll remember what it was you liked about the Harry Potter books to begin with.
B000274THQ|4.0|This 2003 German import has an intriguing story line.  It's set in East Berlin in 1990, at the time of the fall of the Berlin wall.  A young man and his sister have been raised by their mother who truly believes in the socialist ideal.  She has a heart attack and is in a coma for 8 months.  When she awakes, the world has changed.  Her beloved East Germany is no more and there is a rapid influx of western influences.  However, since the doctors say that the mother has to remain calm, the brother and sister decide to make believe that these changes didn't happen.  And, along with a friend who makes videotapes, they contrive to keep the mother believing that nothing has changed.<br /><br />This is an allegory, of course.  And at first it seems very funny.  But the film is a full two hours long, and the joke soon fades.  I found myself looking at the clock and wishing the story would move faster.  Soon it all turns into a soap opera.  Even when the mother tells a long, suppressed truth of her own, the deception never ceases.  The acting was good and I liked the theme though.  And I also liked being picked up and put down in the middle of an historic year in this very special place.  I learned a bit about socialism and the way of life under that regime.  In that sense I did enjoy the film.<br /><br />There was a good extra on the DVD too, in which the filmmakers very carefully explained all the technical effects.  As the film was recently shot, they had had to use computer animation to make it look like 1990.  And they had to introduce a computer-animated version of a helicopter carrying a statue of Lenin and make it seem real.  I was fascinated, as I never quite understood the challenges of making this happen.<br /><br />This is not a film for everybody.  But if you have an interest in modern history and don't mind a slow-paced and repetitive film with an interesting viewpoint about the world, you might just enjoy it.

I immediately ordered the book and read it in a couple of days. The book is really funny, you'll find yourself laugh out loud all the time. Everything about his stories are great, he is honest about his less that completely normal life and family.  <br /> <br />Naturally some of the stories are better than others, some just get an occasional smile, but some will have your sides hurting.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is one of the best war movies ever made.  It tells the tragic, true story of how a simple extraction mission became a mission to simply survive. In 1992, the U.S. and the United Nations wanted to stop the slaughter and starvation of the Somali population caught in the middle of a civil war.  The warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, was stealing international food shipments intended to help the civilians.  An elite force of U.S. Rangers and Delta units were ordered to Somalia to capture two of Aidid's top men.  Black Hawk helicopters and ground forces were dispatched.<br /><br />But one well-aimed missile changed the nature of the operation, as a Black Hawk was downed in the middle of a hostile zone.  Josh Hartnett turns in an exceptional performance as Sgt. Matt Eversmann trying to hold his men together when all hope seems lost.<br /><br />Right from the somber DVD intro, you are helplessly drawn into another world.  The soundtrack, as lonely and exotic as the Somali desert and sea, helps to pull you in.  Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) has done a masterful job; at all times you are in the midst of the action with these soldiers.  Ken Nolan has written a tight screenplay.<br /><br />All the actors are tremendous.  Sam Shepard is the tough General Garrison, who has one of the most prophetic lines in the film: \\"This isn't Iraq, it's much more complicated than that.\\"  This line has come back to bite us in the a**; I winced when I heard it.  Another timely line is delivered by a captured top man of Aidid: \\"Do you really think if you get General Aidid, we will smply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy?  That the killing will stop?\\"<br /><br />Black Hawk is very long, almost three hours.  It seems longer, and is unbearable to watch in parts.  Extremely graphic gore had me screaming out loud.  It is very realistic, with military lingo from start to finish, adding to the authenticity.  For example, the Somali's are called \\"Skinnies.\\"  There is a little humor in the beginning.<br /><br />One gets the feeling from hints during the film that these brave soldiers were screwed by eggheads in Washington who did not understand the situation in Somalia.  We can only hope and pray the situation in Iraq will not end the same way, in withdrawal and humiliation.nnies.\\"  There is a little humor in the beginning.   <br /> <br />One gets the feeling from hints during the film that these brave soldiers were screwed by eggheads in Washington who did not understand the situation in Somalia.

B00005JMUA|4.0|In \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 2\\", the second part of Tarantino's genre-bending epic, the director invokes the Spaghetti Western. Where \\"Volume 1\\" was heavily steeped in Asian Martial Arts cinema, this one is more Western, both in the sense of the Wild West and  Occidental culture. Never fear, there is plenty of action. But, as Tarantino said, \\"Volume 1\\" is the questions, \\"Volume 2\\" is the answers. Not surprisingly, the answers don't turn out to be as interesting as the questions. But this is an entertaining film, and it makes good on \\"Volume 1\\"'s promise. \\"Volume 1\\" gave us Chapters 1-5. \\"Volume 2\\" is chapters 6-10, in which we learn more about the wedding massacre that started the rampage and see The Bride (Uma Thurman) confront her former colleagues Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and, finally, Bill (David Carradine).<br /><br />The cast manages to come across naturally, in even the most campy scenes. David Carradine makes a charming and charismatic cold-blooded killer. Watch for Michael Parks in an impressive dual role as Mexican pimp Esteban Vihaio and, in \\"Volume 1\\", police officer Earl McGraw. His comic timing is impeccable. Chia Hui Liu (aka Gordon Liu) is another bit of interesting casting, as High Priest Pai Mei. Pai Mei is a character borrowed from Chinese Martial Arts cinema, whom Chia Hui Liu battled in several of those films. \\"Volume 2\\" didn't generate the adrenaline rush the \\"Volume 1\\" did for me. But I continue to be impressed by Tarantino's -who claims that he doesn't \\"do noir\\"'- ability to reinvent neo-noir with each new film he makes. Whether he likes it or not, Tarantino will go down in cinematic history as one of the great \\"noir\\" auteurs.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a 25-minute \\"making of\\" documentary and a live performance by Robert Rodriguez' band, Chingon, at the film's premiere. Rodriguez composed the score for the film....for free. Chingon performs one song from the soundtrack. The documentary features interviews with Quentin Tarantino and the film's principle cast.

B000002G87|5.0|This is probably the 20th century's finest outpouring of blues-influenced, electric guitar rock.  Post Cream and Blind Faith, and following a stint in Delaney & Bonnie's touring band, Eric Clapton adjourned to Criteria Studios in Miami with legendary Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd and three former Delaney & Bonnie & Friends bandmates - Carl Radle, (bass), Jim Gordon, (drums), and Bobby Whitlock, (keyboards, guitar, vocals).  Rising guitar legend, Duane Allman, (visiting the studio at Dowd's invitation), was asked to join the sessions, covering the sudden departure of second guitarist, Traffic's Dave Mason. <br /> <br />The interplay between Clapton and Allman is nothing short of sensational - often it's impossible to tell the two apart.  The songs are essentially an extended love letter to his best friend's wife, and Clapton, clearly a man in pain, gives it his all - \\"Layla, you've got me on my knees, Layla, I'm begging, darling, please\\"  George Harrison's wife, Patti, was the object of his affections, and given his friendship with the former Beatle, he's completely honest with his feelings: \\"Have you ever loved a woman so much it's a shame and a sin?  And all the time you know she belongs to your very best friend\\"  And the twin guitars keep on a-wailing!  <br /> <br />Forget the god-awful pap of `Tears In Heaven', (regardless of the truly awful circumstances of its inspiration), Clapton never again played anything this good or this emotional - listen to `Layla', `Bell Bottom Blues', `Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' or `Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out' and experience true greatness. <br /> <br />Kim Porter, Fort Magazine, Australia <br />

B00005JNA2|5.0|When I read that writer-director Richard Linklater had made \\"Before Sunset\\" - a sequel to his 1995 film, \\"Before Sunrise\\" - I remember thinking something along the lines of \\"oh, brother,\\" only not quite as nice.  <br /> <br />\\"Sunrise\\" is a great little movie about an American boy and a French girl, Eurail travelers, who meet on a train, hit it off and spend one great day together wandering around Vienna. They talk up a storm, fall hard for each other but then finally go their separate ways.  <br /> <br />It's a perfectly balanced little entity, like a Hemingway story or a great omelet or \\"Astral Weeks,\\" and it absolutely positively did not require a follow-up. Sometimes it's better to leave young love a memory than to mess with it.  <br /> <br />So imagine my surprise when I saw \\"Before Sunset\\" and realized that ... it's better than the original. It's also the first movie I've seen in a long time that was over before I wanted it to end.  <br /> <br />Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke (who co-wrote the script with Linklater) reprise the roles of Celine and Jesse, who this time meet again in Paris nine years after their first encounter. They're grown-ups, now, both past 30 - her eyes have become more complicated and he looks a bit gaunt, with lines on his forehead and a wedding ring on his left hand. But after a slightly too-good-to-be true reunion they're off and talking again, catching up each other (and us) on what they've been doing for the past decade. Their meeting answers some old questions but also presents new dilemmas.  <br /> <br />Fair warning: This is a movie about conversation. It's relatively short but it's basically more than an hour of a single dialogue between two people who are fairly interesting but who, more importantly, are interested in each other. That's it. And that might be the wrong cup of tea for some, but others may find that it hits them just right, particularly if they're fans of the first film.  <br /> <br />That doesn't mean viewers need tohave seen \\"Sunrise\\" in order to appreciate \\"Sunset,\\" however. Though not the romantic lark its predecessor was, it is a more mature, wiser and, as such, sadder little omelet. <br />
B00005JN7O|4.0|When they pulled the summer release of Sky Captain I had a hunch it was a dog. But I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Certainly the most fully formed vision of a world that never was since Blade Runner or perhaps The Fifth Element.  The obvious comparisons would be to the dreadful Rocketeer or the depressing Dark City (interestingly, both with Jennifer Connally who would have really made this a show stopper!)<br /><br />For those who don't get it this is a high tech retread of 1930s  art, movies and cartoons.  Just as Star Wars was a Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers ripoff, Sky Captain is based on a series of 30's motifs.  Specifically, the robots are from the Max Fleischer Superman Cartoon, \\"The Mechanical Monsters\\" (Paltrow is dressed as the Lois Lane character)  The landing decks in the sky were pictured in Popular Science.  Angela Jolie's group, her rocket belt, the rocket  \\"ark\\" and the hover craft are from Things To Come (with a dash of When Worlds Collide).  And the  giant figure at the end, holding the sword, must have been traced from the Tarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Throw in Lost Horizon and a pinch of The Day The Earth Stood Still and you've got it.<br /><br />But somehow it all works.  Its stylish and I found it suprisingly fun.  There is so much detail it will be fun to examine it on DVD.  Why not 5 stars?  Because it was a little too long.

It's also appeared in various movies and TV shows through the years.

It is a medium paced song of some 5 minutes, 21 seconds. It has a very pleasant melody and Sammy (The Man) Hagar does an excellent job singing. The song ends similar to the beginning with the piano and guitar.<br /><br />Other Killer Songs<br /><br />\\"Runaround\\" is a more monotone song, with some fun lyrics played in a medium tempo and includes some exquisite guitar riffs. Sammy does what he does and gets cute in the middle with these spoken suggestive lyrics:<br />\\"Yeah, hey, yeah!!<br />Ooh, yeah....<br />Ooh, Ahhh, goes like this<br />Listen baby... ooh, ow, ow, uhh....<br />Oh, man it's hard enough, yeah..<br />And you make it harder..<br />Fill me up and then I'm satisfied, own me\\"<br />\\"Runaround also has one of the more memorable Choruses of the year with:<br />\\"Here we go Around, (round, round, round)<br />Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)<br />Here we go around, (round, round, round)<br />She's given me the runaround, yeah, ow! (round, round, round, round)\\"<br /><br />\\"Poundcake\\", starts out with a chain saw type guitar sound moving right into a bluesy rock number with lots of background and a medium slow tempo. As usual Sammy does an excellent job, this time telling us he would like in a woman:<br />\\"Poundcake<br />Yeah, she's gotta have a soul,<br />Or it won't feel right,<br />We're just playin, clean and simple<br />Wrapped up, nice and tight<br />In a home-grown, and down home,<br />That makes a woman<br />Cookin' up that old time long lost recipe, for me\\"<br />also Eddie Van Halen provides some guitar fireworks, especially through the middle of this tight catchy song.<br /><br />\\"In 'N' Out\\", Wow, I just love Eddie's whinny guitar opening this really clever, really classic track. With one of the catchier beats I've heard, you help but bang your head to it if not outright dance. The beat is kind of herky jerky and my man Hagar is on top of his game on this one:<br />\\"Yeah, I been in debt from conception<br />I pay for the rest of your life<br />As long as I remember, bills have looked me in the eye<br /><br />You can have it now but ya gotta pay for it later. Oh!<br />Work me out, the payment's cleared<br />Now you're workin' for the man. Yeah<br /><br />They gotcha goin' in. They gotcha comin' out<br />Same amount, woo! In 'n out\\"<br /><br />\\"The Dream Is Over\\", is a pleasant medium tempo, melodic number that almost sounds like a fast ballad. It's about a man's failures in life and how he blames society in general. Here is the catchy chorus:<br />\\"So, dream another dream<br />This dream is over (Ooo-ooo-ooo)<br />Dream another dream<br />This dream is over (Ahh-ahh)<br />Dream another dream (Dream another dream)<br />This dream is over (Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)<br />Over, yeah<br />So dream another dream!\\"<br /><br />\\"Top of the World\\", Surprisingly, this was the biggest of all the big hits on For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. This, unlike \\"the Dream is Over\\", is another positive upbeat song of a medium pace. As with many of the others it's a song that you could easily catch yourself singing over and over again, with out knowing it. The song itself is nothing groundbreaking but being the biggest hit on the number one album, it certainly must appeal to people and with it's pleasant easy going smooth style, I can understand why:<br />\\"I know you believe in me<br />That's all I ever need. Uh-huh<br />No no, nothin's gonna stop it<br />Nothin' will discourage me.

B0000TLA9G|1.0|What a waste this was.  Here's a band that hasn't been around in the classic inception in almost ten years and somebody decides to release a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation to try and milk whatever amount of revenue and money from uninformed morons {which turned out to be over a million, sadly} that would actually buy into this garbage. <br /> <br />Anybody who owns the best of the three GNR albums (Appetite, Use Your Illusion 1 and 2) doesn't need this.  All the songs are already there, tho about four other great songs from Appetite never even made this release.  We also get a few cover tracks from The Spaghetti Incident (worthless) and this is what makes up your Greatest Hits collection that a million of you spent probably over $10 on. <br /> <br />Again, only a moron or somebody completely new to GNR would buy this.  This is similar to the recently released greatest hits compilation by Van Halen -- unnecessary.  This was released without the bands approval but that also doesn't mean Axl and the other guys don't still reap the benefits from this going platinum -- Axl getting richer and staying home and the other few guys getting richer on the road with a walking time bomb singer and middle-of-the-roader band called Velvet Revolver.  The only guy in this mess I really respect is Steven Adler, who is out with his own cool band playing GNR tunes from the classic line-ups and albums and some originals and clearly not doing it for the money. <br /> <br />I don't even want to review this sad sack any further.  And for those of you clinging to the hope that this supposed \\"Chinese Democracy\\" will be released, keep dreaming.  They've been talking about that since about 1996 (almost 10 years now).  And given say it is released in the next 10 years, don't expect it to be anything worthwhile.

E. B. White's story is simple and charming.  It grasps the reader's attention and won't let it go until the very end.  The movie is pretty good too, but the book is sooo much better!

0131103628|2.0|I originally bought \\"The C Programming Language\\" because I quickly needed to acquire skills in C programming. <br /> <br />After working with this book off and on over a period of 4-5 years I have mixed feelings about its usefuleness <br />either as a tutorial or as a work of reference. <br /> <br />The book lacks structure and organization. After reading it cover to cover the general impression is more of a <br />compendium of individual papers on various aspects of the C language and its context rather than a real \\"book\\". At <br />a different level this is also reflected in the authors' tendency to alternate the trite and obscure with the <br />fundamental, making it unnecessarily difficult for the reader to recognize at a glance what is really important. <br /> <br />The samples of code are generally interesting and they usually exemplify sound programming techniques but they are <br />commented in such a cryptic manner, that a gentleman called Steve Summit who teaches the C language professionally <br />using K&R's the C Language as a framework has published his personal notes online in order to complement the book <br />and clarify its numerous obscurities. <br /> <br />One of the problems with C is the confusing syntax of its declarations.  I expected the book to provide a clear and <br />thorough discussion of one of the major hurdles on your way to acquiring C- read/write fluency. With the exception <br />of a few lines on using typedef's the book altogether avoids the subject. <br /> <br />Perhaps another reason why this book can be confusing at times is that it cannot quite decide whether it is about <br />the C language or about C programming, continually mixing the two approaches and thus making it difficult to use - <br />both as a tutorial and as a reference. <br /> <br />Some fifty pages near the end of the book are taken up by a \\"Reference Manual\\" presenting what amounts to a formal <br />grammar of the language. This standalone document is mostly unrelated to the rest of the book. My guess is that <br />not one programmer in a million would ever refer to this text. So what's it for? Add a little bulk to this very <br />slim volume, maybe? <br /> <br />Arguably the fact that K&R \\"invented\\" C guarantees the quality of the book.. Maybe, although a gift for language <br />design does not automatically make you a great writer or teacher.. And, since no one is ever likely to incriminate <br />themselves the book has a marked tendency to gloss over the weaknesses and traps of the language rather than <br />clearly warn the student about them. <br /> <br />A bit strange that solutions to the exercises are not provided.  Obviously K&R had more important things to do <br />than waste more time on this project. <br /> <br />If I had to start over & learn C programming I would probably look for a good online tutorial to quickly learn <br />basic C syntax and spend my money on W. Richard Stevens's \\"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment\\". I'm <br />pretty sure this would get me up to speed a lot faster than working with this book. <br /> <br />Once you realize that working with a programming language is also about integrating a culture you will come to <br />think that you need this book after all.. Generations of C programmers have learned from it and as a result it <br />has pretty much shaped the face of C programming..  This may be one reason why you will eventually want to buy <br />\\"The C Programming Language\\".
B000001DTM|5.0|This album has to be one of the highlights of U2's long and lustrious career.  I really love the way they incorporate middle eastern rhythms and dance/techno into their progressive style of rock.  MYSTERIOUS WAYS has to be one of their greatest songs, and the heartfelt ONE is a somber ode to the AIDS epidemic.  UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is one of the best dance tracks of the early '90s, and it is easy to see it as being a real forerunner to the trance songs we hear today.  It's an excellent album, and one that should properly be put in the annals as a classic record...a real early '90s showcase.
B00005AQF7|5.0|How can anyone give this cd only two stars?? Anyone who does must not know anything about rap, especially someone who would compare this to 50's albums. This album easily blows away any G-Unit related album. <br /> <br />Ive had this album for over 10 years now, and still play it on a regular basis. Thats the sign of a true classic. Snoop would never make another album this good again. His flow and style was perfect on this album, and this was Dre's highest point as a producer. Every song is great, no filler tracks at all. Overall, this is in my top 5 rap albums ever, and probably #2 as a matter of fact behind only 2Pac's \\"7 Day Theory\\" album. Cop it if you havent already!!
B000286RNY|3.0|yeah, i just got finished watching this movie and overall, this is quite an interesting film.  <br /> <br />The special effects were good...tha acting was good...it was a pretty good movie.  <br /> <br />Didn't have any curse words...no EXPLICIT scenes...just a fun film for tha family...well, at least everybody over tha age of 13, as tha rating says on tha back of tha DVD. <br /> <br />I'm not going to buy it but it is worth a look-see at least once but it's not something I'm going to add to my DVD collection... <br /> <br />so if you haven't seen it...you should RENT IT first to see if you like it...

B00005JN7O|5.0|Writer-director Kerry Conran's debut feature \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is both an amazing-looking modern technological feat and a darn entertaining throwback to old Hollywood serials. It's got so much in it that's cool to look at, first of all. And the plot, story and characters have so much pluck that the film wins you over.<br /><br />Thank goodness someone had the sense to finally make a live-action movie about giant killer robots invading New York. I was afraid they wouldn't make one in my lifetime.<br /><br />The story is told in old Hollywood comic-book style, where the hero always cares about his wacky sidekick way more than his girlfriend. The heroine's hair and makeup is always flawless - even though she's escaped from the giant robots, traveled across the globe (and underwater!) in her ex-boyfriend's plane, gotten trapped in a radioactive mine filled with dynamite AND tried to get the biggest scoop in her career as a reporter.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, also known as Sky Captain, the flying ace who heads his own private air battalion intent on protecting the world. Law gives Joe enough attitude and goofy charm to come off as a clean-shaven Errol Flynn in this movie.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, in the funniest and perhaps trickiest role in the movie, plays Polly Perkins, a reporter for the New York Observer who's not above putting her own life (but never her camera) at risk while tracking down an evil madman's plot to destroy the world. Polly, who's either brilliant or dumb-as-a-post depending upon the situation she's in, is also completely self-serving and manipulative. She whines too much, bugs Sky Captain too much, flirts too obviously and doesn't listen to anything anyone has to say. Because of this - and because she's following in the footsteps of her female-heroine ancestors like Fay Wray, her character is HILARIOUS.<br /><br />Many people might have a problem with Polly for this same reason. But, as Paltrow plays her, she's more than just face-value irritating. Paltrow plays her intentionally without irony, short of winking at the camera much of the time, but the joke of Polly Perkins and the running gag of her camera comes through in spades in the film.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie shows up briefly, but her part in the film is key. And her biggest scene provides the film with a great moment that had me and others applauding in the theater.<br /><br />As for the computer effects, they're awesome - even if they're at times obviously fake. That's partly the point, for the effects in the movies \\"Sky Captain\\" is paying homage to did the same thing. Still, the sepia-toned look of the entire film is a marvel.<br /><br />The movie just sweeps you up in its glee, and there are cliffhangers every 10 minutes - the likes of which I haven't seen since \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" \\"Sky Captain\\" has mild language, good laughs and would work for the whole family.<br /><br />It's a very fun trip.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This DVD really did not need \\"extras\\" (those will abound from supporters and detractors in the future).  The powerful cinematography and score did justice to the story as prophesied in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New.<br /><br />Obviously Mel Gibson used artistic license in many scenes, particularly with the character of satan and most of the children(!)  Yet most of the Scripture is followed, even in it's most brutal aspects... except for Isaiah 52:14, which predicted Messiah would be unrecognizably disfigured to the horror of those who saw Him.<br /><br />Gibson has said that he backed off from the true level of violence done to Jesus so that the audience would not disconnect with Caviezel's portrayal.<br /><br />Over all, a classic spiritual film - thoughtfully and respectfully presented -- which will take it's deserved place as one of the best of all time.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|With the release of \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Special Collector's Editions)\\", the remarkable end product of novice filmmaker Kerry Conran's ten-year odyssey to create a breakthrough live action/computer-generated film is finally given it's due. While the reviews of the film, itself, were mixed, the box office was disappointing, and Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's brilliant computer-enhanced \\"Sin City\\" would soon 'steal' it's thunder as a technical achievement, Conran's accomplishment certainly deserves a place of honor of it's own.<br /><br />Using a primitive, five-minute, home-made 'teaser', Conran, and his brother, Kevin, without any previous film experience, were able to generate enough interest to involve veteran producer Jon Avnet, who brought in stars Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. As a growing group of young, dynamic animators were attracted into joining this most non-conventional team, a breathtaking, noir-influenced homage to movie serials, Classic Hollywood, and the Fantasy/SF genre emerged, a film that certainly deserves a spot in every movie buff's film library!<br /><br />The film is ideally suited to DVD, where the pre-WWII 'look', and sly references to \\"Metropolis\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"King Kong\\", \\"Godzilla\\", \\"King's Row\\", the Fleischer \\"Superman\\" cartoons, \\"Lost Horizon\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\", and many other memorable films can be savored...and how many current films can boast of young Laurence Olivier as the villain?<br /><br />Certainly, the soft-focus, 'dark' photography can be distracting, at times (the 'look' actually gave me a headache, when I viewed it on a theatre screen), and the heralded appearance of Angelina Jolie is really little more than a cameo, but there is a sense of fun to the proceedings, and a sweetness that is far more 'family-friendly' than the blood-drenched \\"Sin City\\".<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" may not get the long-term recognition of the Rodriguez/Miller 'instant classic', but Kerry Conran has much to be proud of!uez/Miller 'instant classic', but Kerry Conran has much to be proud of! <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />
B00005JN7O|4.0|It took awhile to get used to the CGI sets, but after awhile you forget about them as you are pulled into the story. The special effects were quite good at creating an old-fashioned atmosphere for the film, and I thought the characters all had good chemistry, especially Law and Paltrow.  Do not go into this movie expecting anything serious, and it is certainly not logical, but aside from a few slow spots Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow never fails to entertain.
B00005JN7O|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) I generally enjoyed this movie.  The imagination and creativity of the ideas was worth seeing, and I like the \\"retro\\" feel of the visuals - although that fuzzy washed-out look DID get a little irritating at times.  Ideas like the floating \\"mobile airstrips,\\" the rocket ship, and the \\"amphibious squadron\\" were cool to see.  And there are great Buck Rogers-ish aspects like the \\"heat beam\\" ray gun invented by Ribisi's character Dex.  An homage to the old Saturday afternoon serials, the story also reminded me at times of the Star Wars series -- not as much in the sci-fi department, more in the way the characters are constantly being placed in peril and having to escape.  However, there are several places in the movie where things get a little boring - I heard people around me yawning, and my own attention was drifting.  So in sum, I had fun overall with Sky Captain, but it's no classic.
0780629450|5.0|+++++<br /><br />Shakespeare's tragic play (and longest play) of \\"Hamlet\\" (written circa 1601) is a play that has everything in it: grieving and death, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, political deceit, revenge, and the fundamental question of whether it's better to live or die.  As well, in this play, there's a play within a play; in Hamlet the character, there's a character within a character.  Hamlet's psyche continually unfolds; there's always another level waiting to be explored.<br /><br />Director Kenneth Branagh's \\"Hamlet\\" captures all of this.  As well, he has retained all five acts or twenty scenes of Shakespeare's play as originally written so nothing is eliminated and we get to hear the Bard's beautiful language throughout.  The only thing that's different is that the costumes and setting have been updated to the<br />nineteenth century.<br /><br />There are seven major characters in this play:<br /><br />1. Hamlet (Kenneth Branagh): Prince of Denmark, son of the former and nephew of the present king; the \\"melancholy Dane;\\" a \\"sweet prince;\\" a scholar, gentleman, and idealist, thrust by fate and by social demands into the role of bloody avenger.<br />2. Claudius (Derek Jacobi): King of Denmark, an \\"incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,\\" \\"a vice of kings,\\" as contrasted with his murdered brother and former King who had the opposite traits.<br />3. Gertrude (Julie Christie): weak-willed Queen of Denmark and mother of Hamlet: \\"Frailty, thy name is woman!\\"<br />4. Horatio (Nick Farrell): faithful friend and confidant of Hamlet, \\"a man that Fortune's buffets and rewards hath taken with equal thanks...not passion's slave,\\" \\"more an antique Roman than a Dane.\\"<br />5. Polonius (Richard Briers): conceited and dull Lord Chamberlain, a \\"wretched, rash, intruding fool.\\"<br />6. Laertes (Michael Maloney): hot-headed son of Polonius, \\"himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\\" foil to Hamlet.<br />7. Ophelia (Kate Winslet): daughter of Polonius and sister of Laertes, beloved by Hamlet but slave to social convention and her father's will.<br /><br />All the above actors do a good job in their roles.  However, I felt that Kenneth Branagh (as Hamlet) and Derek Jacobi (as Claudius) did an extraordinary job. (Jacobi also played the character Hamlet in a 1980 BBC production.)<br /><br />Fortinbras, another character although not a major one, is important to the play.  He is a capable and well-balanced Prince of Norway, \\"puffed with divine ambition;\\" and foil to Hamlet.  The actor who portrays him, Rufus Sewell, does not look Norwegian but looks more Spanish or even Italian.<br /><br />The smaller roles in this movie were given to mainly well-known American actors.  Of these, Charlton Heston as the Player King and Billy Crystal as the first clownish grave-digger did good jobs in their roles.  Robin Williams as the court fop and \\"water-fly\\" Osric also did an adequate job even though I think he was better suited as the second clownish grave-digger.  Jack Lemmon as the Danish castle guard Marcellus seemed to have difficulty with his words and Gerard Depardieu appeared to be scared in his role as Reynaldo, the servant of Polonius.<br /><br />The character Hamlet has more lines than any other Shakespearean character and since this movie, as mentioned above, is uncut, you will hear all the great phrases such as the following:<br /><br />(1) \\"in my mind's eye\\"<br />(2) \\"it smells to heaven\\"<br />(3) \\"method in his madness\\"<br />(4) \\"Brevity is the soul of wit\\"<br />(5) \\"Neither a borrower nor a lender be\\"<br />(6) \\"There's the rub\\"<br />(7) \\"the dog will have his day\\"<br />(8) \\"Get thee to a nunnery.\\"<br /><br />You will hear all the great speeches such as the one that begins with \\"What a piece of work is a man!\\"<br /><br />Finally, you will hear all the great soliloquies such as the one that begins with \\"To be, or not to be,--that is the question.\\"<br /><br />The ending of this movie is spectacular.  The finale is filled with breath-taking dueling, dramatic suspense, murder, poisoned chalices, carnage, deceit, forgiveness--all ending with Hamlet's unforgettable death.  Director Branagh adds some of his own touches in this scene, thus enhancing its dramatic effect.<br /><br />Finally, the scenery and sets are visually stunning.  (The filming was at Shepperton Studios and on location at Blenheim Palace, both in England.)  As well, the background music adds to the movie.  The piece \\"In Pace\\" sung by Placido Domingo during the rolling of the end credits was, I felt, a nice final touch.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.<br /><br />(1996; 4 hours; widescreen; color)<br /><br />+++++ath-taking dueling, dramatic suspense, murder, poisoned chalices, carnage, deceit, forgiveness--all ending with Hamlet's unforgettable death.

B000002GY9|5.0|Late one night in the 70's.on the low end of the dial, a DJ was compelled to play the entire album.  I listened mostly to Miles and new music like Weather Report...I was completely transfixed...I never heard a record continue onward with such genius and originality.  I went to work the next day, and a lot of people were talking about the album.  I still consider this a masterpiece....and would like to remind people that no lyrics are repeated on this album.  That alone is astounding.  There is a light that shines on this man like no other..I want to add the the immediacy of presence of this recording is also stunning, and as CD players have improved, this recording is starting to stand out as an audiophile classic. I mean, just check the players!

B00006G8G1|4.0|This is a great DVD with really good sound and picture but it doesnt get 5 stars for a coubple of reasons. First the set list. There are too many songs from \\"Brave New World\\". Now it was a good album and good comeback but I think they should have added more classics like \\"Aces High\\", \\"The Clairvoyant\\" or \\"Flight of Icarus\\". Another problem are the special features. To be honest they are quite boring and they could have been done much better. Overall though if you are an Iron Maiden fan this is definitely worth buying.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|This movie was a masterpiece of film-making - technically. The performances were better than first rate. I never knew Sean Penn could act. Tim Robbins was brilliant and Kevin Bacon as always made his character.<br /><br />The story itself however was such a downer. Just plain depressing. I didn't see any deep moral to the story, it didn't examine the human condition in any way that meant anything to the real world and it started as a downer and depressed you from there. They style was dark, and from the first scene you just knew that these was to be no good at all in this movie. Just from sad to worse as the film progressed.<br /><br />I'd have given anything for alternate ending
B00005JN7O|5.0|When I first saw the previews earlier this year for SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, I thought, \\"What a dumb looking movie.\\"  A few months later, I saw a longer trailer and thought, \\"This looks interesting.\\" I decided then I would see the film when it came out. A few days before the film's opening, I discovered that other than the actors, a few props, and some costumes, SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW was completely computer generated.  The movie would be worth seeing for that achievement alone.<br /><br />However, SKY CAPTAIN is worth seeing for far more than for the by-line it will receive in cinematic history.  The movie is a complete throwback to old action/adventure serials that used to be shown before the \\"A\\" picture would start.  The INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS films were all inspired by the same pictures. SKY CAPTAIN feels like those movies (cheesy lines and all), but influences from KING KONG, THE WIZARD OF OZ, the Island of Dr. Moreau, and Flash Gordon also have a prescence.<br /><br />SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW takes place in the year 1939. Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an ace reporter for the Chronicle newspaper. She receives a cryptic message from a top scientist about a cynical plan to destory the world.  Before she can find out more, the city is attacked by a huge army of giant robots (think evil IRON GIANTS).  Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law) is called into action and saves Polly from being killed and the city from being totally destroyed.  \\"Sky Captain\\" has a special base outside of the city where he and his private army work at saving the world. Anyway, neither Joe or Polly can figure out what the robots wanted. Then Joe's base comes under attack as does New York. During the fight that assumes, Joe's best friend and genius designer, Dex Dearborn (played perfectly by Giovanni Ribisi) is kidnapped by the invading army. Thus begins a chase over halfway around the world to rescue Dex and uncover what in the world is going on.  Add some mutated animals, a few dinosaurs, and a flying aircraft carrier and you've got The World of Tomorrow.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg knew that audiences loved those types of movies, that's one of the reasons STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK were such huge blockbusters.  Many people have become way to cynical in their movie watching. Some movies entertain, some educate, and the best do both.  SKY CAPTAIN isn't meant to be a film to instruct the masses and change the world. Instead, it's a huge piece of mind candy that more than satisfies. Of course, the technological wonder that the film is could change the filmmaking world, much in the same way that STAR WARS did over 25 years ago.  There were a lot of STAR WARS imitators and I'm sure there will be many SKY CAPTAIN wannabes, too.  Whatever the case, I left the theatre wanting more and actually excited at the prospect that there could possibly be a sequel. So, put the cynicism away, sit back, relax, and enjoy this wonderful world of tomorrow. It'll make you forget about today (at least for 2 hours).going on.

B00005JN7O|5.0|Those who love film are going to recognize Sky Captain as a turning point, much as 2001, Star Wars IV and Jurassic Park were turning points.  While computerized special effects and CGI have been tools for decades, in Sky Captain, the director has taken the next step and used CGI to transfer what is in his mind directly to the screen without having to make any compromises regarding locations, sets, weather, and all the other impediments to realizing a vision.  The implications for the artist are staggering, and the fact that the director chose to visit the classic serial genre with all its deco/moderne/expressionist trappings is a bonus. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, all this is going to go right by a lot of people, particularly young people (even Star Wars was nearly 30 years ago).  But those who love Metropolis, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, King Kong, Lost Horizon, and all the propagada movies and cartoons from the late 30s/early 40s along with modern-day homages to the old-style movie movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars IV will feel very much at home and will thoroughly understand the soft focus and color palette. <br /> <br />I loved every minute of this and will be first in line for the DVD.
0790729407|4.0|In an episode of the 1980's cop drama \\"Miami Vice,\\" Liam Neeson put in an appearance as an IRA terrorist-or at least I think he did if memory serves me correctly. Perhaps his depiction of an Irish tough on television laid the foundation for his work in Neil Jordan's 1996 bio pic \\"Michael Collins.\\" The 1990s saw several films about the \\"Troubles,\\" the word often used to describe the unremitting conflict in Northern Ireland, arrive in theaters. Maybe the hopes of a lasting peace in the troubled region during the last decade, as the IRA agreed to lay down their arms on several occasions, inspired Hollywood. I don't know. Whatever the case, armchair fans of Ireland had plenty to look at in the Cineplex for a few years. While I haven't seen most of these films, I have seen \\"Michael Collins\\" several times over the last eight years, and it is difficult to imagine any of these other pictures surpassing this one in any way, shape, or form. Jordan's picture is an inspired piece of work, a beautiful yet politically complex look at how the IRA came to function as an urban guerilla operation in their efforts to secure a unified Ireland free of British oversight and influence.<br /><br />The film starts on a dramatic tone as Irish rebels battle British troops in the Easter Uprising of 1916. This rebellion fails despite the fact that most of England's resources are tied up in the war raging on the continent. Most of the upstarts-including Michael Collins (Neeson), Harry Boland (Aidan Quinn), and Eamon de Valera (Alan Rickman)-march off to lengthy prison sentences. The perceived ringleaders aren't as lucky: the British line up most of these chaps against the wall and gun them down. Eamon de Valera is one of the few higher ups to survive in large part because he was born in America. With their leadership decimated, Collins and his associates await their release dates so they can continue the fight with the British. It doesn't take long for the rebels to reconstitute a command structure once they get out, but the failed revolt has left its mark on many of the participants. Two schools of strategy emerge concerning future operations for freedom. De Valera and others seek to once again arise and duke it out with the English just as they did in 1916. Collins knows this option will lead to another loss and further prison sentences. He supports taking the war underground by resorting to guerilla warfare in the streets and alleys of Ireland. By striking and then hiding, Collins believes the Irish movement has a much better chance of forcing the British to the bargaining table.<br /><br />Collins gets his chance to launch a bloody campaign against the British when the Irish leadership heads off to jail again. With the assistance of Harry Boland, he persuades groups of young toughs to raid armories for weapons. He also manages to acquire the secret loyalty of an Irish cop working for the British, Ned Broy (Stephen Rea), to allow him access to the mountains of police files on Irish resistance groups. With an inside view of what the English will do before they even do it, Collins's campaigns of violence become amazingly effective. His boys wipe out a special detachment of Brits sent in to quell unrest. They assassinate police officers and officials. Collins is generally safe from the authorities due to a host of reasons, the least of which include his support from the people and the fact that the cops have no clue what he looks like. How the British didn't know Michael Collins on sight considering he spent time in jail is something I can't explain, but nonetheless his terror missions serve their purpose. The British seek a resolution to the conflict, and Eamon de Valera charges Collins with the task of acting as the Irish emissary. This decision is an adroit political move on de Valera's part, and one that has lasting and violent consequences for the future of Ireland.<br /><br />I liked everything about \\"Michael Collins\\" even though the movie suffers under the onerous burden of two key problems. First, the entire subplot involving Harry Boland, Collins, and an Irish lass named Kitty Kiernan (Julia Roberts) tends to grate. I'm sure the studio insisted on putting a romance theme in the movie in order to sell more tickets and to temper the strident political message, but doing so detracts from the power of the film. Second, historical accuracy occasionally flies out the window in lieu of dramatic license. Witness the sporting event where the British drive an armored car onto the field and promptly gun down the athletes and fire into the crowd. The documentary on the film appended to the DVD discusses this depiction in some depth, and even Jordan admits the event didn't happen exactly the way he portrayed it. But what's good works wonders. Neeson is magnificent as the revolutionary both brutal in his outrages and horrified at the results. Rickman plays de Valera with a sinister silkiness. These two actors are so good at what they do that Rea and Quinn often fade into the background. The locations and set pieces look authentic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the extras don't live up to the film. You get a trailer and the aforementioned documentary (which does run for nearly an hour, at least) and that's it. I would have taken the DVD release of this film as an excuse to add a bunch of information about the Irish struggle for independence. C'est la vie, I guess. Whatever the case, the movie is definitely worth the price of the DVD. \\"Michael Collins\\" is a film I watch whenever I get the chance, and I will continue to do so well into the future.ers under the onerous burden of two key problems.

0790751216|3.0|This movie just came out a bit over average in my opinion. Frankly speaking, I was sort of disappointed with this movie and I will explain why below.  <br /> <br />The plot was not creative at all. Clint Eastwood rides in a settlement of Independent Miners whom a criminal Tycoon is trying to run out. They are sitting on a gold mine and the greedy Tycoon wants it for him even though he already owns all the surrounding area. Clint Eastwood who dresses up as a Preacher rescues the miners from this Tycoon and his minions.  <br /> <br />So, for the Hardcore Fans of Western-genre, the story is pretty much average and a rehash of many older stories and movies. Thus, this movie looses 1 -2 stars there.  <br /> <br />This movie also does not have good 'shooting' scenes. Only in the final climax scene does Eastwood actually shoot up the criminal marshall and his deputies and that too is not as good. Lack of enough gunslinging made me want to give it another star less. <br /> <br />You will notice a SHARP contrast to 'Outlaw Josey Wales'.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I've seen it...and I am ashamed. How can Mr. Lucas take a movie and continually change it until it almost doesn't even resemble the original? I am referring to Return of the Jedi. I watched the Ewok Celebration scene. The rumors are true. Hayden Christensen is now Spirit Anakin in ROTJ. I don't what to say except that I'm glad I own the ORIGINAL trilogy on good 'ol VHS to preserve the perfection of these films. I'm sorry Mr. Lucas, but I will not be purchasing your DVD. I'm glad I saw it for free as an employee rental from Blockbuster. You make me sad.
0783228007|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood's one of the best Western's. Even though it may not be as good as 'Outlaw Josey Wales', it is still pretty awesome.  <br /> <br />Clint Eastwood is Joe Kidd in the movie. A gunslinger in one of the towns who has been locked up. Joe Kidd is a man who does what he wants to do and sometimes gets in trouble with the Law. A Land Tycoon pays off his fine because Joe Kidd is the best gunslinger out there.  <br /> <br />Land Tycoon and his minions are trying to run out some poor mexicans from their rightful land. Joe Kidd first supports the Tycoon but when he realizes the situation, he decides to help out rebel mexicans to save their land.  <br /> <br />This has many good shooting scenes. Even though the story wasn't great, the shooting scenes make up for it. You will especially love the last part where Eastwood rams into his enemy gunslingers' building with a locomative and starts shooting! <br /> <br />Anyhow, many claim that it is just an ordinary movie. Ignore them and buy the movie.
B00005LK95|4.0|Short Circuit 2 is one of those movies in a class all it's own.  The character of Johnny Five has an irresistible charisma that I just love.  Sure, other movies feature an out-of-it's element protagonist possessing unusual abilities that both benefit and alienate it, but Short Circuit 2 also has believable characters, good dialogue and delivers an emotional impact.  Witnessing Johnny Five's trials and tribulations proves to be an interesting experience.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is the fact you can't take the movie too seriously.  There are some impossible actions taken by the robot that will leave you with a \\"yeah right\\" feeling.  Also, some harsh language is used which I found to be unnecessary.  It would've been better to leave it out in order to make the film suitable for all ages.<br /><br />This is one sequel that's superior to the original.
B0000029DD|2.0|I have heard nothing but great reviews for this cd so I got it and I'm highly disappointed.  I agree that he has good lyrics and is very emotionally expressive but this is music, not spoken word poetry, and melodies count.  Unfortunately, his melodies seem to wander all over the place.  Go check out Elliott Smith and Aimee Mann for great contemorary examples of songwriters who are literate and melodic.      Buckley's tortured falsetto voice is difficult to listen to in one sitting.  Lacking any real subtlety or restraint it often comes off as whining.    As for all those who gave this cd 5 stars, I have to wonder if it's due to the fact that almost no one can write a decent hook, and Jeff Buckley is simply the best of a bland lot.    The one highlight of this album is his superb remake of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.  However one song can't redeem the whole cd.  Spend your money on Leonard Cohen instead.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard the single \\"This Love\\" on MTV. However it was not until I fell in love with \\"She Will be Loved\\" when I knew I had to check this band out. This album is truly unique. I like all types of music from Oldies to Backstreet Boys to Linkin Park to Lil Jon and the East Side Boys, along with classical music and jazz. Songs about Jane is an album that combines many gneres, but ties them together with their own style. R&B roots lie in jazz and blues, as do funk roots. I don't really care for the whole ocncept of genres, but if I had to categorize this I'd say its Jazz, R&B, and funk infused rock, or Jazz, R&B, and funk infused pop-rock, if you will. It's lamost like a less flamboyant Prince meets rock, but definatley not hard rock. Listening to the samples of the song on Amazon.com, I knew I wanted this CD and it was wort every penny.
0452282152|2.0|The novel starts off visually evocative, describing at length the process by which painter Vermeer goes about his work: about the colours, how he never really feels a painting is finished, and how there must always be something to snag the eye in the finished product.  However, this quickly deteriorates into Griet's obsession with her master (Vermeer), and how, though Tanneke, a fellow maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer, has had her likeness painted (for the wealthy patron Van Ruijven), Griet finds shame and guilt in being the subject of one of Vermeer's paintings - for the same Van Ruijven.      Perhaps I'm being too insensitive, and maybe Griet's overwhelming beauty IS enough to make a painting of her a scandal, and yet a painting of Tanneke a joke.  But besides even the basic holes in the plot, there are major flaws in the character development (which, depending on the character, may be nonexistent), lack of any good wording, and most of the novel is written in summary.  Even the scenes somehow seem to be summarized and disconnected, and one finds herself/himself not in the action, but seemingly above and beyond, watching with a disinterested eye.  Tracy Chevalier many times fails to involve the reader with complex emotions, and the novel is basically devoid of ANY emotion.    The one consistency I find is the steady decline of imagery into Griet's hysterical desires.  The last half of the book is little more than Vermeer's youngest daughter being despicable, and Griet's trailing her master with her eyes wherever he goes, even to the point of spilling wine all over his wife.  The end is melodramatic, proving to the reader that Vermeer, though letting Griet take the blame for the painting he made of her (again, it was painted because of a special request by lustful, creepy Van Ruijven, who has set his hormonal eyes on the young maid), somehow cares for her anyway...or at least, feels sorry for her.    I am sorry to say I could have read this book in third gradeand been dissatisfied with it.  The writing does not seem to be a labor of love, and rather reflects an amateurish, immature-ish writing style.  I have heard it called a \\"chick book\\", but being a \\"chick\\" myself, I can't even see it as that.  The author takes too little time to tell what could have been a deep, involved story.
B00003CXCT|1.0|What the hell is this, in an age where I can get a movie in wide screen and formatted for my tv, where is Star Wars, the original Star Wars.  Don't tell me we can't get it on the same disc, and if that is so put another disc in the pack.  I didn't mind the special edition versions but the original holds up just as good if not better. Protest this box set, do not buy this peice of s**t until it is finished and we get the real first three movies.  My only solace is that I already own the real Star Wars on vhs tape.  I just pray that my tapes lasts long enough until they complete this garbage, I mean we waited this long for what, really what was the big effort that went into it.  I for one am not buying this and any true fan wouldn't either.  My guess would be that six mounths from now there is another set released, can anyone say money grab.  DO NOT BUY THIS I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS.  As fans we deserve it all,  we waited long enough.  If we don't buy this and demand more they will have to give us what we want.  And george quit screwing with a good thing, if something is perfect you dont alter it, idiot.
0399230033|5.0|This was the first book that my son really responded to. At 18 months he laughed out loud at the part where Mrs. Zookeeper realizes there is a gorilla in her bed! No words on that page,  few words elsewhere, just a funny story with funny pictures.  He is 3.5 now and he still gets a kick out of the simple story and hilarious pictures.
1400031354|5.0|I now have a problem - I am hooked. After reading the first book of this series I felt I have to keep on going. After reading the second book I will not rest till I read the whole series. I admit that I am now in a better position to pinpoint several flaws which are more apparant in the second book but these have not spoiled my utter enjoyment. This is a quick read which gives you a feeling that you are not only enjoying yourself but also learning something at the same time. At least this is how I felt.   <br />In the second book the main focus is still Mma Ramotswe, but a very central part is given to her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (and rightly so). Maybe it is easier for the writer to enter into the mind of a man, or maybe he just really likes this guy, as the reader does. He is a kind man, and as one he is easily \\"forced\\" into a new responsibility: adopting two kids, one of them in a wheelchair. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni fears the reaction of our heroine, but she surprises him (Mma Ramotswe reaction seemed a little \\"too good to be true\\" for this reader but things have a nice way of \\"arranging themselves\\" in this book). <br />Mma Ramotswe continues solving mysteries with the help of her loyal secretary, Mma Makutsi, now promoted into the position of Assistant Detective. However, as in the first book I felt the mysteries were not the real essence. The book is really a love song for Africa and the African people (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni for example, wants to give Mma Ramotswe a diamond from the Botswana earth). In this book the writer continues to share with the readers (ignorant in my case) some of the African traditions, way of life, and especially their way of thought.  <br />My slight criticism is of the very easy way in which mysteries are solved. Somehow, Mma Ramotswe happens to meet the right people, to get what she wants out of them or to have the right \\"feelings\\". I confess, I do believe in intuition and especially woman intuition, but it seems that this feeling isa little over used here. Mma Ramotswe is surprised that not all people know, like she does, when someone is lying; this is very clear for her. Another issue is the very easy acceptance of feminism and modern ways in spite of a very central theme in the series of preserving the African ways and traditions, be it with Mma Ramotswe \\"traditionally built\\" body or with her thoughts how children act disrespectfully nowadays. I cannot understand how this is settled with the acceptance (even in thought) that there might be a girl mechanic (coping on a wheelchair) running the garage, aas much as I would like it to happen.  <br />A great book. Am looking forward for the third.
B0002858YS|4.0|You, the face of indie rock seems to change, well according to Spin Magazine and people in general have made it change too. Just because you look like you got up in the morning and slapped your clothes on, then swung by the music shop to pick up some vintage instruments doesn't make you 'indie'.  <br /> <br /> <br />Back on track here, The Killers' debut is good, fluffy, irresistable fun but it can be bad for you in full consumption. The first single \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is cleverly catchy, with a hook so good that it alone was reason why I purchased the album, the rest of the music on here suits these Las Vegas rebels quite well. The first song seems like some type of continuation of of Duran Durans' \\"Friend of Mine\\", the song's name is \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine,\\" it begins with a crackle out of the speakers like a dusty cassette tape. Other mighty-fine highlights include \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Smile Like you mean it\\".  <br /> <br />But eventually the album gives way to being just a little too slow and the down-tempo of their ballads lose focus quickly, this is a band that wasn't built on expressing themselves slowly and introspective, instead they resonate when they're playing poppy-love songs with obvious hints of Pulp, The Smiths, Joy Division and others. <br /> <br />It's a good debut, but I don't suggest listening to it for long periods of time, it's one of those albums that's good to pop, stop and play when the moment is right, like right on a Friday night before you head out into the town.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|In this film, Harry begins his third year at Hogwarts. Things start out really well for him: after escaping from his horrid relatives, he reunites with his good friends and begins another awesome year of magic and mischief with his fellow wizards-in-training. He will soon find out, however, that dark forces are awakening and evil is haunting his footsteps. Sirius Black, a notorious follower of Voldemort, has shockingly escaped from Azkaban (the wizard prison). No one knows where he is, but everyone knows he has one target: Harry. Things start getting exciting as Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands (of course) despite warnings to the contrary, once again proving themselves courageous and loyal beyond their years.     This film has everything a great movie should have: awesome acting, chilling special effects, great music, and gorgeous scenery. WHY are some people complaining that it's a huge disappointment because it wasn't true to the book?! I've read all the books (LOVE them as well as the movies), and, alright, I do admit there were a few details missing in the movie that were important:     1) The fact that Harry's father and his friends used the nicknames Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs (found on the Marauder's Map) when they turned themselves into animals.     2) The awesome scene in which Gryffindor wins the ultimate victory for the first time in years.     I was really surprised that these were left out, but no one can deny the fact that the character's personalities and the magical feeling of the book were brilliantly done. I believe that both Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron did awesome jobs with their different styles. The actors say so, J.K. Rowling says so, and let's not forget that Rowling's approval is what really matters. If she thinks the movie's accurate enough, that should be the end of any complaints. The movie may not have all the details of the book, but it definetly has the heart and the spirit of it.
B00028HBKM|2.0|As an Asian American male, I can objectively state this movie is highly anti-simitic. Quite frankly, I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme. Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.<br /><br />1)Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy. He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor, but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus's teachings. Three separate times, he tries to save Jesus's life. First, when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt. Then, refusing to condemn the man, he sends him to Herod. When Herod sends Jesus back (again not finding him guilty), Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him. The Jews, of course, chooses to save Barabas instead. Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus, hoping it will quell the Jew's anger, the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free. The Jews, and only the Jews, demands Jesus be cruxified.<br /><br />2)The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands. This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands(which may have actually happened few hundred years back). Not only is this scene unbiblical, but historically unlikely. The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched. A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable, especially by pharisees, and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.<br /><br />I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews. In this, I found it even more disturbing than Jesus's death itself. He did die, after all, as a practicing Jew.acticing Jew.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Richard Donner's ambitious, astronomically expensive (for its time) epic gets halfway there, though nearly all of its shortcomings are purely technical.  Grappling with a story that 1978 filmmaking and effects techniques couldn't hope to deliver, it seems like a miracle the film could be made at all.  The special effects work fails to convince, and coupled with poor cutting and poorly timed, low-brow humor gives the movie a cheesy look that threatens to bury it (one can't help but wonder where all that money went).  Further still, the film is drably staged, poorly lit, and woefully inconsistant in tone (it's deadly serious one moment, dreadfully the next), bringing Donner's limitations as a director to the forefront.  By all rights, this picture should have been a disaster.  But it isn't; thanks mostly to the sheer scope of the story, the film sucks you in, and even its drab visuals and glacial pace can't seem to snap you out of it.  The Superman legend is the stuff of great mythology (the parallel between Kal-El's story and the story of Moses is uncanny), and it's all there on the screen.  Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, shines with an openness and charm that belies the God-like power his character has at his command.  Margot Kidder's hyper-feminist Lois Lane is both boorish (in a good way) and sympathetic, and Gene Hackman's cackling, Saturday morning-cartoon villain Lex Luthor always entertains you.  It all adds up to a film whose substance helps compensate for its poor form (unheard of today), and brings to life a story that was told twenty years before it should have been.  Also features Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, and Susannah York in a brief bit.
B00005OWEG|4.0|This movie has the look and feel (sometimes) of the juxtiposition we experienced in Viet Nam. We could move for days to our pickup point with absolute noise security to find a riverboat with their radios blaring (as in the movie). Scenes as this were very disturbing and real and brought back memories I have buried for years.  <br /> <br />During these moments I could almost feel the intense heat and smell the jungle. I have yet to be able to finish the film.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I have to say I was indeed a little surprised by Avril's sophomore album.  I've never been an outright fan of Avril's, but I think 'Under My Skin' is quite an improvement from the first;  'Let Go' was all about reinforcing the image of an underage punk girl filled with angst and horomones.  'Skin' rounds out Avril's personality, proving she does have something more to sing about than skater boys.  \\"Slipped Away,\\" the last track, in my opinion is the standout track.  It's not as bad as Izzy would have you believe.  If it were an option, I would give 3 & 3/4 stars
1577311523|5.0|\\"The Power of Now\\" is comprehensive and complete. For those with interest in New Age spirituality, the book serves as an excellent tool for understanding the many and somewhat etherial aspects. On CD, one must concentrate, for Tolle speaks softly and in somewhat of a monotone nature, but don'f let this get in the way of the content! Highly recommended along with Dyer and Ruiz.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Stephen Schwartz has long been a lightweight in American musical theatre, over the years churning out high school/college favorites like Godspell and Pippin (the latter was only good because Bob Fosse got his mitts on it).  Wicked is a different story, primarily because he was lucky enough to engage the formidable singing and acting talents of Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel in the lead roles, both of whom elevate his music and lyrics far beyond whatever pedestrian elements are intrinsic to them.  Chenoweth and Menzel are thrilling, powerful, accomplished Broadway singers who here seem to be challenging each other to new heights, which only benefits everyone in the end (most of all Mr. Schwartz).  Menzel's Elphaba cannot seem to hit a wrong emotional note -- she is probably the most expressive singer I've heard since Barbra Streisand.  As for Chenoweth, she's hilarious, sly, joyful and knowing as Glinda -- I can't imagine anyone else in the role.  And that's the acid test, of course -- without these two leads this musical will probably never again be as galvanizing, nor as soulful.
B0002DB52M|4.0|A colleague from Danmark recommended me to see this film, Dogville, directed by the internationally acclaimed Danish director Lars von Trier. So I did. The movie was shot in door in a play-like setting -- no real houses and no walls but drawings on the floor to indicate where the houses and the streets are -- which I think is an inventive idea in film-making. With the narrative, filming the movie this way, without visually elaborate scenery, it really makes one focus on the deeper aspect of the story, namely the emotions and feelings of the characters, which are so often ignored by the audience.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This second film in the Harry Potter series is very good.  Very good in the same way that say, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was.  The talented cast, consisting of newcomers as well as screen heavyweights, continued their effective performances from the previous film.  Jason Isaacs is an excellent addition as the evil Lucious Malfoy.<br /><br />As good as this film is, I do not believe that it is as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  You see, Chamber of Secrets definitely had more action.  And the special effects are once again nothing short of amazing.  However, it lacked the drama that the first movie had.  Chamber of Secrets is primarily an action film.  Whereas the Sorcerer's Stone could arguable be considered a beautiful drama.  I do not fault the filmmakers.  They were faithful to the book.  It just so happens that the second book in the series is more action oriented.<br /><br />There were some very subtle, but beautiful, memorable scenes from the Sorcerer's Stone.  How about that scene with Harry and Hedwig outside in the snows.  And really, all of the scenes involving the Mirror of Erised were quite touching.  From Harry seeing his parents, to Dumbledore telling Harry that it doesn't do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.  In my opinion, it is subtle, well-crafted scenes that separate the good movies from the greats.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe's acting is really great to watch.  He cannot be accused of over-acting.  He gives new meaning to subtle.  His facial expressions, really his appearance and demeanor as Harry Potter is very believable as someone who has spent the first ten years of his life being the victim of neglect and emotional abuse.
B000003TAB|4.0|This album came right after Nevermind and when i bought it back in the mid 90's i listened to it a few times but never gave it much thought. I have been listening to it a lot the last few years and nwo that my musical knowledge has grown i can tell how Nirvana was influenced by 60's pop and 80's punk. Bands like Black Flag, angry samoans and circle jerks which Kurt Cobain was a big fan of come through strong. This has all types of songs from heavy grundge , pop-punk, hardcore punk and some metal-sounding songs. Good range from Cobain and the boys.
B0000025KI|5.0|I was 8 years old when this album came out, and it was the album that initially led me to being a Springsteen fan.  Over 20 years later, I regard \\"The River\\" as the finest album ever recorded.  The songs span every emotion, from heartache to celebratory.  The fast songs will make you get up and dance.  The ballads will bring chills up your spine.  This CD could be the soundtrack to anybody's life in itself.
0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman was at his most brilliant in this book. It's similiar to Alice In Wonderland to a degree. Which was featured in Neverwhere. The characters were completely likeable and the story was engaging. Brilliant!
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's self titled debut is not only one of the most significant pop albums of the 80s, but one of the greatest pop albums of all time.  It doesn't have any of the weird or controversial material that you will find on later Madonna albums.  This is just clean, pure 80s dance pop.  Every time I listen to this album, it brings a smile to my face.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Not as powerful as their debut, but certainly packs a punch.  Extremely addictive, not a single song is bad in any way.  However, I would suggest that those who are yet to discover SoaD and their true greatness to start from the ground up and get their first album before moving onto Toxicity and Steal This Album.  Not that there's anything wrong with starting here, I just think it gives a much better feel of what they're all about.  I know for a fact that I didn't completely appreciate Steal This Album until checking out the first two, but of course, that's just me.  Moving onto the review itself, below is a quick rating and comments on each song. <br /> <br />1.  CHIC 'N' STU - A great way to start a great album.  Very addictive, one listen and you'll be hooked.  Crazy lyrics, the opening is nice as well.  A perfect example that SoaD hasn't changed, still just as good as they've always been. (10/10) <br />2.  INNERVISION - One of the best tracks on the CD.  The lyrics are actually kind of beautiful in a strange sense, and the way Serj rips into it at points makes it even better. (10/10) <br />3.  BUBBLES - Not bad, I suppose, but not great.  It's pretty cool the first couple times around, but something about it just doesn't pull you in like most songs on the album does. (8/10) <br />4.  BOOM! - Excellent song about war and the unnesessary death involved.  Powerful lyrics and ever better riffs, they really do rock out in this one.  It's got a certain sound unlike the rest that makes you want to play it over and over again (10/10) <br />5.  NUGUNS - Probably the weakest song on the album.  Like Bubbles, it just doesn't hit me as hard as the others. Still a good song, never the less.  Takes a few listens to warm up to, but still very good in it's ways. (7/10) <br />6.  A.D.D - Good song, somewhat haunting.  Anyone who believes that System of a Down is getting soft or loosing their touch needs to give this a spin. (10/10) <br />7.  MR. JACK - The best song on the album, without a doubt.  If I could go higher than 10 out of 10, I would.  Starts out kinda slow, beautiful use of just about everything.  By the end, you'll see what I mean when I say this is probably the most emotional song on CD.  Nice cursing bit at the end.  Really stands out above the rest. (10/10) <br />8.  I-E-A-I-A-I-O - Strange song, but really kinda fun and addictive the first couple times you listen to it. (9/10) <br />9.  36 - Nice beginning, but far too short.  Would be much better if it had another minute or so added. (9/10) <br />10. PICTURES - One of my favorites, often overlooked, I think.  The lyrics are strange, you really don't know what the hell they're saying the first couple times around, but it's got an addictive sound to it that keeps you coming back for me. (10/10)) <br />11. HIGHWAY SONG - Great drums and guitar with even better lyrics.  The first time I listened to it, I was hooked. (9/10) <br />12. F*CK THE SYSTEM - Great opening with silly lyrics (if you would even consider them lyrics, that is).  Mainly just a bunch of jibberish, but just as addictive as the rest. (10/10) <br />13. EGO BRAIN - Pretty good song, nice lyrics.  The melody is different, not that there's anything wrong with that.  I felt that it could have been better, perhaps less boring. (9/10) <br />14. THETAWAVES - Kinda simple, but once I listened to it a couple of times, it was stuck in my head for good.  Cool lyrics.  The perfect way to begin Roulette, too. (9/10) <br />15. ROULETTE - Beautiful song.  I didn't like it the first time I heard it, but it tends to grow on you after a while.  Mixes in the rest of the album quite well. (10/10) <br />16. STREAMLINE - A lot of emotion involved, the perfect way to end with a bang.  Great in every aspect. (10/10) <br /> <br />To sum it all up, nothing has changed in my eyes.  This is still System of a Down, and if anything, this is a high point.  As the title for the review says, can't wait 'till the next ablum.
1881273156|4.0|This is an excellent book for those that are considering marriage and for those that are married.  The author says we each have a way in which we express love and a way in which we recognize love as being expressed to us.  Some of the stories he tells focus on men going outt to work and women cooking dinner and things like that and so many people don't live that way any more but overall there are a lot of helpful hints in the book.
B000007T1M|5.0|Excellent in every way possible.  Full of powerful riffs and even better lyrics, there is a strong meaning behind each and every song.  This is where the magic first began and I suggest that everyone who is yet to discover System of a Down to start with this before moving onto Toxicity and Steal This Album.  Don't get me wrong, they're both just as good in their own ways, but one can't fully appreciate System of a Down until giving their all-star debut a listen.  Below is a quick rating of each song on a scale 1-10 as far as what I thought. <br /> <br />1.  Suite-Pee - 9/10 <br />2.  Know - 9/10 <br />3.  Sugar - 10/10 <br />4.  Suggestions - 8/10 <br />5.  Spiders - 10/10 <br />6.  DDevil - 9/10 <br />7.  Soil - 10/10 <br />8.  War? - 9/10 <br />9.  Mind - 7/10 <br />10. Peephole - 10/10 <br />11. CUBErt - 8/10 <br />12. Darts - 9/10 <br />13. PLUCK - 10/10 <br /> <br />This is probably the first album I've ever listened to and found each song just as addictive as the next.  I recommend.  =)
1573228737|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this and stayed up until 1:00 AM to finish it. It was really compelling. The Victorian gothic atmosphere was well done; it could have been cliched but it wasn't. I was haunted by the story afterward. I give it a high recommendation.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead's latest major studio album may not be as innovative and imaginative as some of their previous work, but then again how many albums are? Simply put, this album solidifies their status as one of the greatest rock bands of the past 20 years.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this movie.  I heard the word \\"controversy\\" again and again but I could care less about the hype.  Any film based around religion will be controversial. <br /> <br />I pop the movie and it start basically at the betrayal by Judas.  Already I'm disappointed since much more happened in Jesus's life.  But alright.  So the beatings begin.  And it continues relentlessly until the movie ends when Jesus dies on the crucifix.  I kinda figured out about an hour into the beatings/movie what Gibson was trying to depict.  So I sit threw it.  The accuracy of this movie was believable.  By accuracy I mean how and where the movie was filmed, not the biblical accuracy.  I'm not very religious so I wouldn't know this side of it.  The only unbelievable part for me was how badly he was beaten.  I personally would have died in the first 30 minutes of the beatings. <br /> <br />The gore factor was off the hook.  Many people have used the word gore in their reviews for a reason.  We're not talking violent, brutal, or cruel...we mean gore.  I had a hard time watching some of it. <br /> <br />I wish I rented the movie instead of buying it though.  It was one of those movies that only need to be watched once.  I wouldn't show this movie to kids but that's just my personal opinion. <br /> <br />I'll give Gibson credit for one thing though.  When I think about the crucifixion of Jesus I'll always remember the scenes from this movie.  I doubt anyone will out-do depicting the horror of that day. <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam is possibly the greatest band ever assembled.  Better than Nirvana, not saying that Nirvana isn't good.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|besides of the good special effects of the werewolves aka lycans, this movie was very dull and boring. some good fight scenes. very slow and is a great movie for getting your parents to fall asleep so you can sneak out of the house
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I'm gonna grade rappers and tracks but overall the album is great Buy it and you'll see <br /> <br />First the Tracks <br />Git Up: 6/10 <br />Loyalty: 9/10 <br />Be Like U: 3.5/10 <br />I'll be damned: 5/10 <br />Dude (skit) + My Band: 6.5/10 Play em together <br />U R the One: 5.5/10  <br />6 In the Morning: 5/10 <br />How Come: 10/10 <br />Leave dat boy alone: 6/10 <br />Get My Gun: 9.5/10 <br />Bizarre (skit): 5/10  <br />Bitch: 8/10 <br />Steve's Coffee House: 8/10 Funny <br />D12 World: 7/10 <br />40 Oz: 9.5/10 <br />Commercial Break: 7.5/10 Buy Devil's Night to understand <br />American Pycho 2: 8.5/10 <br />Bugz 97: 8/10 <br />Good Die Young: 9/10 <br />Keep Talking (Bonus Track): 5.5/10 <br /> <br />You probably get it. The Album sux at first but gets awsome. My Band and Loyalty should hold u over the first 8 Trax. How Come is the Best on the Album probably because it features only Eminem, Kon Artis and Proof the best rappers in the group. It's Not as explicit and better than Devil's Night Their first album and kinda disappointed they only released 2 singles My suggestions: Loyalty or Good Die Young. <br /> <br />Now The Rappers: <br /> <br />Eminem: How Many People bought the Album just for him? Ok he's good but for me not the best. But is the most original and has the best lyrics 9/10 <br />Best Verse: American Psycho 2 <br /> <br />Kon Artis: He could have gone Solo and you can see why. His Voice reminds me of Redman. He owns Loyalty 9/10 <br />Best Verse: How Come <br /> <br />Swifty: Rap Good but it's very much the same all the way through if you want to hear swifty at his best listen to Under the Influence on the Marshall Mathers LP. 7/10 <br />Best Verse: My Band <br /> <br />Proof: For Me the Best Rapper has a cool Voice and is good on every song he's in 9.5/10 <br />Best Verse: 40 Oz. (Best part of Album) <br /> <br />Kuniva: Is easily confused with Swifty but his voice is lower his rap isn't as good but he has better lyrics. 7/10 <br />Best Verse:40 Oz. <br /> <br />Bizarre: He can't rap his lyrics are funny sometimes but usually offensive. Bizarre gets old but he's at his best on this album 3.5/10 <br />Best Verse: Bitch (Funny)
B000002KAT|5.0|Ok, i listen to about every type of music you can listen to, i like the clash, the beatles, led zeppelin, joni mithcell, metallica, jewel, enya, beethoven, the who, johnny cash, miles davis, and about anything else you throw my way. I have heard thousands and thousands of albums. A few stand out as master peices, such as Zeppelins \\"Houses of the holy' & \\"IV\\" or The Beatles \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgnt Peppers...\\" The Clashes \\"London Calling\\" Miles Davis's \\"Kind Of Blue\\" Coltranes \\"Love Supreme\\" <br />The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and The Velvet undergrounds \\"Velvet underground and nico\\". All of these are some of best recordings you will ever hear, but all of them combined still pale in comparison to Astral Weeks. <br /> <br />Astral Weeks by Van Morrison is the best album of all time on many levels, in its dreamy, whistful lyrics, awe inspiring vcals, and musical structuring so complex that it is sometimes bordering on impossible to pick apart. Though admittedly it is not my \\"favorite CD\\" considering as how whenever i listen to it i have to hear the whole thing, it is easily the best. I first heard it a year ago when i bought it from the library as a \\"wake up\\" CD, i thought it would be a pleasent way to wake up. I was right, but, i ended up being late for school because i got sucked into the CD and didnt have time to get ready. This CD has a unique quality to it that i only find on Radiohead CDs, and that is the ability to not only portray emotion, but BECOME an emotion. After listening to Astral Weeks of Kid A, you don't walk up to a freind and say \\"im in a sad mood\\" or \\"im in a happy mood\\" u say \\"im in a Radiohead/Van Morrison mood\\". It is impossible to describe this CD in words, so just go out and buy te damn thing already! <br /> <br />btw, whoever thinks that moondance is better, go [do something bad] yourself. It may be your fave, but to say it is BETTER is pure blasphamy.
B0000013G9|5.0|This is TLC at their best.  When I first played this \\"tape\\" back in 1994, it was an instant hit for me. It showed me that these girls have talent, not just kiddie clothes, pacifiers and rainbow colored condoms.  My favorite track is Take Our Time.  When my brother first heard that song, he didnt even realize that it was TLC.  Job well done!  R.I.P. Lisa Lopes.
B00020HEG6|3.0|The Music from the Harry Potter films by John Williams are indeed awsome. Each film has been watched in awe with the flowing sounds from this master that magic really does fill the air. When we buy the CD the magic dissapears, especially in the prisoner of azkaban. For a start wheres the lovely cue that launches the film with the choir? and the bubble bubble toil and trouble sounds like its been recorded in a local council office. <br />Wheres the score? Once again I feel cheated by the music industry from what should be the same magic as you get from the films.
B0000025PA|5.0|This is a classic must have album for any toto fan I love this album my favorites are :ROSANA, AFRICA, CAN'T HOLD YOU BACK THIS IS A GREAT GROUP AND A GOOD ALBUM BUY IT!!!!!
B0000075ZB|3.0|The Heartbreaker album can't count as one of the best Dionne Warwick CDs, but this one includes the title song Heartbraker which is written by the Bee Gees. It's a very good sound, and Dionne put a lot of emotion into it. Other songs sounds ok, but not so good as the previous albums of Dionne Warwick. Should do better.
B000063COX|5.0|this together with judas priest british steel made nwobhm <br />this is the best maiden album. <br /> <br />allso look after killers, number of the beast, piece of mind, powerslave and seventh son of a seveth son
B00003CXCT|1.0|I grew up watching these films.  I went to each of the three original releases at least 10 times each with my friends.  I (or, more often...my parents) purchased just about every Star Wars toys around at the time.  I helped to make George Lucas a millionaire MANY times over.  I cannot believe that he would completely change & re-do the films that made him so completely rich...& made so many people happy.  If he wants to release these new \\"& improved\\" versions along with the originals that would be one thing.  But, to change the originals so that they almost don't even appear to be the same movies is a tragedy.  I WILL NOT buy these DVDs & I refuse to watch the next film when it comes out.  The last two have been pure crap anyway...there's no reason to think it will be any better.
B00003W8NM|5.0|How do you fight the decaying morality of modern civilization; based on credit-cards, IKEA-furniture, Starbucks coffee shops on every corner. Even the family has become a franchise and there seems to be now way out. <br /> <br />Meet 'the narrator' whose insomnia leads him to do very very strange things. Is he the messiah, leading the world into a new form of society? Sometimes it looks like it. <br /> <br />He meets a man called Tyler Durden, a maker of soap. This soap is special soap because it is made of human fat. Fat women clean themselves with their own vanity is what the movie is trying to say. <br /> <br />To get out of the materialistic world they start a fight club in which the beat each other up and slowly lose all possessions. They have a plan to blow up creditcard buildings, so everyone will start over again. The ingredients of soap are also the same for dynamite and nitroglycerin. Soap will hereby wash everything clean again. This project, called Mayhem, is where the movie leads to. And the narrator and Tyler face each other again, like in the beginning. <br /> <br />The end of the movie, made stronger with \\"Where is my mind?\\" by the Pixies, is confusing. Apparently the writer of the original book enjoyed this more than his own.  <br /> <br />I have to watch it over and over again. Check out the imdb.com site about Fight Club, there are some interesting twists you'd never thought of before. <br /> <br />One of the greatest endings ever... <br /> <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Robert McNamara, one of the brightest and one of the best Camelot bred cold warriors, reminisces.<br /><br /> FOG OF WAR is pretty much a monologue conducted by former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, with a few questions shouted by an off-screen interviewer. The film is divided into eleven \\"lessons,\\" introduced by a short, epigrammatic title card: Empathize with your enemy, Get the Data, etc.  Filmmaker Errol Morris won an Academy award and it's easy to see why.  Few extended talking head programs are this riveting.  It helps, I suppose, that this central figure in the early history of the Vietnam War was still so sharp and lucid, although still a tad reticent to engage in an in-depth discussion of Vietnam.  Smart use of archival footage and still photographs, and a pulsing undertone score by Philip Glass, make this a treat for anyone interested in Cold War politics circa 1965.
B0002I831S|3.0|In all the years, I have put off buying Star Trek TOS on VHS, then DVD because I was waiting for a complete season set. My wait is over! After all these years...  <br /> <br />I would have given this a 5 star rating. But there are a few things that cut me back to a 3.5. The series itself is 5 stars...don't get me wrong on that. I love this series.  <br /> <br />Best part, no matter the prices I have seen, this set averages less than $5 per episode. That's a definate great value. <br /> <br />But the DVD set here has a few issues for me. <br /> <br />The Jewel case the DVDs themsleves rest in is very vulnerable to breakage. I had to return my 1st set to exchange it. I bought mine locally here in town, I could not wait for it in the mail. And for this reason I did not have to go through the time and effort of shipping it back.  <br /> <br />The next big issue is the horrible William Shatner after Star Trek special feature. UGH! I'd rather see an interview of him speaking OF his Trek Years. I don't care about his personal life and love for horses. This is supposed to be about TREK here.  <br /> <br />I think each disc should have a \\"PLAY ALL\\" feature where you can just insert the DVD and play all of the episodes within it.  <br /> <br />And with this feature there should be an option to play them in \\"production sequence\\" OR \\"Aired Sequence\\". But being the aired sequence was so jumbled...you'd have to change discs contantly. Was NBC on crack back then? I feel most Trek fans (like me) would just have rather had the DVD designed in Production sequence instead of the NBC aired sequence.  <br /> <br />But I am most pleased this is finally available.  <br /> <br />The wait was well worth it and I am most defiantely not a patient individual. <br /> <br />After all these years... I THANK YOU!
B000001F45|3.0|I'm a metal head & most of my music perspective comes from that viewpoint.  \\"Salisbury\\" rocked, \\"Look At Yourself\\" rocked, \\"Demons & Wizards\\" rocked (although a little less than \\"Look\\"). On this effort, however,  other than the opening track \\"Sunrise\\", there is not one  really hard rocking track to be found.  Yes \\"Sweet Loraine\\" rocks minimally, but Hensley's screaming organ really overshadows nearly everything on this song.  This album is far, far from \\"heavy\\".<br />If you like your music laced with keyboards, acoustic rhythm guitars & with no memorable guitar solos, you could maybe up this album to 3 1/2 stars.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad album.  It's a must have for any Uriah Heep fan.  But newcomers would be better served to start with the twin purchase of \\"Look At Yourself\\" & \\"Demons & Wizards\\". Heck  add the \\"Live In 1973\\" album to your cart if you have the extra cash.  Soak in those purchases for awhile before you opt on this one to mellow out.
B0002I831S|3.0|I am one of the crazy few who bought the initial 40 volume DVD release of Star Trek TOS.  I don't regret the purchase as I enjoy the series very much, but I do regret the obvious difference in price versus what I originally paid for the series.   <br /> <br />I don't feel that bad about not getting the box set though after hearing what I have heard about the lack of re-mastering or poor extras on this release set.  <br /> <br />I've encounter a few problems in the first season release of Star Trek the Next Generation as far as video quality as well.   <br /> <br />Paramount could learn from a the Dr. Who series.  There is a team of fans who work at BBC that restore old Dr. Who episodes and they do a WONDERFUL job!  I've seen old B&W footage that looks brand new as if it was just shot.  I'm really to pay extra money for the Dr. Who DVDS because I know I am getting a high-quality product.  Too bad Paramount doesn't treat ST fans with the same respect.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I'm not an Avril fan although I do enjoy some of her (previous) songs from Let Go. However, I have to say that 'Under My Skin' was a HUGE dissapointement.  <br />The only song on the album I actually play is 'Together' and still I try to avoid the ending of it(not a fan of her screaming, sorry). 'Take Me Away' has got quite good lyrics, I can partly relate too but again, the chorus ... not for me. 'He Wasn't' is probably one of the most annoying song ever.Plus crap lyrics. So all in all, not a good song.'How does it feel' has nice melody but again, I think the lyrics are a bit pointless. 'Don't Tell Me' was overplayed so much that I almost hate it same for 'My Happy Ending'.  <br />As I said before, I expected a really great, outstanding album but most of the songs either sound the same, have lyrics I'd not call 'good written' or some annoying screaming in it. In conclusion: Let Go was far better and clearly more various.
B00003CXCT|1.0|George Lucas has insulted the fans and the kid I was during the early 80s growing up with Star Wars: Special Edition ONLY DVDs.  If he wants to go and,IMHO, subjectively mess up his original story with bad CGI (not all CGI is bad, but Jar-jar Binks and the fake Jabba were just awful)that is own business. But I do not understand why he can not simply include the ORIGINAL theaterical releases on the DVD.  That is all I ask. Hell, even if I hate Ep. III I would buy the entire 2007 edition of all six movies when it comes out just to get my hands on the original releases in DVD form, but I won't buy a single George Lucas film at all until he releases Star Wars in the Original form.  George Lucas is darned lucky he released the Indiana Jones set first before announcing that the Star Wars Trilogy is not the \\"classic\\" trilogy it once was.  I was born in 1977.  Just my subjective thoughts to the new younger fans of Star Wars.   If the special effects, including CGI, are awesome, but the plot of the film is awful then the film is still bad.  Plot should ALWAYS come first and then be supported by CGI.  Great CGI does not make a great film.  A good story does.  I feel bad writing this review, but I can not believe how indifferent George Lucas is!
B00028HBKC|2.0|I dunno...I watched this movie expecting it to, at least, arouse SOME sort of emotion, but really, my strongest reaction ended up being, okay...that was pretty boring.  The problem is, it's just dramatically inert.  There's no sort of progression or anything; just wham wham wham the power of christ compels you the end--and the violence is so stylized that even the most basic of visceral reactions is precluded.  Further, Jesus in this movie is so obviously an allegory rather than an actual person that it's impossible to feel anything for him.  They might as well be beating on a pinata.  There's a VERY short snippet from the Sermon on the Mount, and a few other flashbacks, but really, who's fooling whom?  These have about the same weight as story segments in a porn film (which this in many ways IS); they're a tedious obligation, and underplayed as much as possible...which may well be a blessing in disguise; while Caviezel is adequate as a meat puppet, he's not so much so when required to actually, you know, act.  The only at all sympathetic, interesting, or indeed human character in the film is Pilate (though the scene with the camp King Herod is one of the movie's few truly amusing moments); however, as far as that goes, you'd probably be better off just reading The Master and Margarita. <br /> <br />In many ways, the film's anti-semitism is the least of its problems; however, it is there for anyone who cares to see it.  Physically, the hook-nosed, beady-eyed, conniving Jewish patriarchs embody every Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion-style stereotype in the book (whereas Jesus and the posse are clearly already Christians, in spite of actually being, you know, Jewish themselves), and while the Roman soldiers may be comically sadistic, the Patriarchs are obviously the primary villains here; the solidiers are just their blunt instruments.  It's not necessarily something that's going to leap out at you unless you're really looking to have your prejudices reinforced, but I can see it being pretty unhealthy for anyone on a subliminal level. <br /> <br />Granite, there is a fair level of artistry here, even if most of it's wasted.  The opening is atmospheric (though that mood is quickly destroyed when the disciples start busting out the mad ninja skillz on the Roman soldiers), and the creepy androgynous Satan is reasonably cool.  Also...okay, actually, that's about all.  I didn't find the film particularly painful to sit through, but I don't really recommend it either, except in a \\"see what everybody's talking about\\" way.  But if you do see it, you have to follow it up with South Park's \\"Passion of the Jew.\\"  Hysterical stuff.
B0000028RR|5.0|The self-titled album by Rage Against the Machine is an excellent addition to any collection.  Being their first, they burst onto the scene with a well composed album containing many popular songs such as \\"Killing in the Name\\", \\"Know Your Enemy\\", and \\"Wake Up\\" just to name a few.  With its heavy metal sound and commanding tone this album gives inspiration and energy to anyone listening to it.  The lyrics also add to its strengths by addressing the issues of the United State and the problems around the world.  Put these two together, and you get one powerful album. <br /> If heavy rock music is your thing, this album is a must have.  Whether you need something to get you pumped up and going or are looking for an excellent album containing many great hits to listen to while driving in your car, pop this in the player and get ready.  From the opening with \\"Bombtrack\\" till the ending with \\"Freedom\\", just put it in and let it play through because each and every song will blow you away. <br />
B00008H2LB|5.0|I only recently started to like Linkin Park, and i gotta tell ya, THEY ROCK. I first got Hybrid Theory and i thought it was pretty good (4 stars), but in my opinion Meteora is a heck of a lot better .  Can't stop listening to it.  Its one of the coolest CD ever.  Hope LP comes out with another one soon.
0792833236|5.0|First, in terms of boxing footage, this is simply the most gripping biopic you may ever see. Forget Ali or Hurricane. Scorcese's shots of fisticuffs in the ring reek of a majestic grandeur usually associated with opera.<br /><br />Second, the B&W photography emphasizes style and myth, but doesn't detract from realism.<br /><br />Third, and most importantly, De Niro and Joe Pesci are astounding in how well they wear the skin of brothers from the Bronx. De Niro bags most of the credit when people speak of this classic, and his performance truly is soul churning, but Pesci matches that brilliance with his effortless turn as a brother/manager too.<br /><br />The theme of jealousy and personal rage overpowering and eventually demolishing a man who was otherwise a thunderous sportsman, deserves no less than this riveting drama.<br /><br />The DVD itself is a knockout too, get it, it stands tall to repeat viewings.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|You don`t have to be a huge Leone fan or even a fan of westerns to enjoy this film.Guided by the hand of Italian director Sergio Leone,we are treated to what the west could have been...harsh but beautiful,barren but full of promise and populated by people with hopes,dreams,desires and fears of what could be.<br />Claudia Cardinale is Jill,the [hooker] with the heart of gold.Jason Robards as Cheyenne,the bandit who stummbles across the score of a lifetime.Henry Fonda as Frank,the ruthless killer bent on getting the job done whatever the cost.Last but not least,Charles Bronson is Harmonica,the nameless drifter mysteriously bent on killing Frank.<br />The birth of a town,the death of the old west.Sweeping views and extreme close-ups are used to vividly tell the tale of Sweetwater.<br />My father and I sometimes could not always see eye to eye but there was one thing that we could always agree on.....this powerful and entertaining tale is one of the best films of all time.<br />The bonus disc is packed with ruminations from the people who made the film,thoughts and views of some of the directors that were so deeply affected by this beautiful film,visiting locations and hearing how this classic came to be completes the story...it all makes for an unforgettable experience.This is one for your collection.
B0002HTZJI|4.0|I never really \\"got\\" the chilli peppers 'til i started hearing songs from Californication. It almost seemed like they had a new \\"sound\\". Ah forget all that, this band is as good as it gets right now, buy this thing, who cares how much it costs, all the songs are better live, no, really, this is the reason they make live albums.
B0000024K1|5.0|It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back tells us exactly what Public Enemy means: they are activists with their own mind, sharing the hearts of influential leaders such as Malcolm-X, Martin Luther King etc.  Apartheid in South Africa was still a big issue, crack as well as other drugs was in full effect and Black Power was on the edge of defeat. Public Enemy gathered every knowledge they could research and put it all together in a form of a CD that they dropped in '88. This was their second and most influential album, slapping 14-carat asses back to the righteousness Malcolm-X represented.    The Bomb Squad, producers of Public Enemy, dropped street beats using below-the-tempo bass, screeching horns and revolutionary sound bites to suit any revolution's needs, that would demand a musical Uzi weighing a ton. While Chuck-D brought the power of Martin Luther King, Flavor Flav brought the rage of Black Power and Terminator-X brought the equipment needed.  Result? INSTANT CLASSIC. Never (and I mean NEVER) will there ever be another It Takes a Nation of Millions..., Rebel Without a Pause, Bring the Noise, Don't Believe the Hype, Night of the Living Baseheads and Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos are just some classics you need to cop. It's a no-brainer thing to do if you call yourself a rap fan and don't own this album. Public Enemy jammed on def rhymes and rhythms that would shake and shatter the many generations to come.    Influential, a classic, mind-blowing, captivating, gripping, all these words and more describe just how INCREDIBLE this album is. It's all the many reasons why you should own it. Though the messages wouldn't mean as much as it did when it was released, the power and rage of Public Enemy still is very influential. A mind-bloggling tale that will only make sense listening to the disc from start to end, Public Enemy have never sounded fresher than this.    Best moments= Bring the Noise, Louder than a Bomb, Night of the Living Baseheads, Black Steelin the Hour of Chaos and Rebel Without a Pause
0767805712|5.0|This is not a typical film review, but a warning about the downside of the new Superbit version. Though the picture is beautiful, no question - the Superbit version does not include the extras that add so much texture and insight to the original DVD film experience itself.<br /><br />I love Gattaca, and the extras on its original DVD release added to my enjoyment. So when the nice, new, silver-boxed version came out I expected that in addition to its improved picture there would be even more extras, in the tradition of other special collection releases.  I was surprised that not only weren't there new extras, there weren't extras, period.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't buy the Superbit version, but you deserve to know what you're not getting.
B000003B6J|5.0|Before 2Pac, Eminem or any controversial rappers back in the days and today, there was N.W.A., the most controversial group ever known. Consisting of Ruthless Records original CEO, Eazy-E, one of the most important black producers in music business today, Dr. Dre, hard but influential rapper, Ice Cube, underrated but one of the best gangsta rappers, MC Ren and a DJ, DJ Yella (along with The D.O.C. and Arabian Prince as unofficial members), they formed the nucleus of N.W.A. (acronym for Niggaz With Attitudes) and went out and put Compton on the map. <br /> <br />If the streets had to say something, they would turn to N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton to serve as their definite voice. Although it is not as appreciated as it use to be nowadays, it's fair to say that Straight Outta Compton still owns the fact that this is still an influential album. <br />While Public Enemy infested the baseheads with their '88 classic, injected multiple doses of social analysis into the establishment of their musical attack, N.W.A. came outta nowhere and crushed it. Seconds, no, milli-seconds, after the self-titled album hit the streets, Compton became a hip-hop landmark, all thanks given to N.W.A. With Dr. Dre and DJ Yella's genius productions along with Ice Cube's spine-chilling Charles Manson-inspired prophecies and Eazy-E's childish voice, it frightened America. So much, they considered N.W.A. menaces to society. In return, N.W.A. stood up with balls and declared that \\"they'd swarm on any muthaf*cker in a blue uniform\\" on F*ck the Police. And do you know what's gangsta? Them getting a letter from the FBI warning them not to perform that song ever again and what do they do? Perform it at a live concert where they all got arrested. Straight up juice for that to them from me. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, G funk-injected villainous anthems like Dopeman and Gangsta Gangsta gave their listeners criminal minds, making it acceptable to root for the bad guy.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Star Wars, to quote the neo-marxists, is one truly OFFENSIVE movie against someone's intellect. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig are philosophical characters compared to any of Lucas' cash in flicks. Every single character has the quality and relevance of a cardboard box soaked in a leaking gutter. The extraterestrial characters \\"embrace diversity\\" (don't you know, \\"people\\" in the outer space are postmodernists as well...), while all the bad characters are clearly modelled upon guess whom? The FASCISTS, of course. Darth Rader (or something) is a born again Adolph Hitler with much wider goals: conquer the UNIVERSE (rather than our forgettable planet) at all costs. He has no family, no \\"humanity\\" (as if being human is something of a choice), he MUST be wasted so the world be better...<br /><br />I remembered how much I disliked this movie even as a child. Everyone in my country crowded the cinemas to see this forgettable trash just for it was popular in the West. When I saw it, I just felt sorry for the \\"bad character\\", for nobody seemed to care about his fate and everyone cheered upon his death.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Seriously, if you haven't seen this, stop reading and go buy it NOW.  Because: \\"Only after you've lost everything, that your free to do anything.\\"
B00005Q3KC|4.0|I don't see how people can review a \\"best of\\" album and totally trash it. These songs are exactly what made the Corrs famous. I am from the US, and unfortunately we don't get enough musicians like the Corrs around here to show everyone what good music is. That said, onto the album. I happen to own this cd with a \\"bonus\\" bonus track after \\"Make You Mine\\", called \\"Lifting Me\\" - and I have to say that this is an excellent compilation of the Corrs' work. I gave it 4 stars, however, because a few of my favourite tracks (the instrumentals \\"Toss the Feathers\\" and \\"Paddy McCarthy\\") did not make it on here. Oh well! I keep it in my cd player all the time and would recommend it to anyone, but mostly to people who have not had the pleasure of listening to the Corrs' earlier works. Some standout tracks include \\"Would You Be Happier?\\" (I love this song on the \\"VH1 Presents the Corrs Live in Dublin\\" disc), \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten\\", and \\"Only When I Sleep\\". All in all, a great cd!  <br />
0767803434|5.0|This is an action movie that captivated me the first time I saw it and still keeps me from changing the channel whenever I come across it.  It has all of the essential elements of a great action movie; great script, good directing, above-average acting, a reasonable amount of special effects, plenty of twists, and lots of action.  \\"Air Force One\\" takes but a few minutes to set the stage, introduce the main characters, and let the events begin to come together. <br /> <br />Harrison Ford is the president, with a solid military past, whose plane is taken over by Russian reactionary militants.  The concept that the events of this struggle would primarily take place on a jumbo jet adds to the excitement; there's no running away (although it may, at times, seem that there is).  I won't go over the plot because, if you haven't seen \\"Air Force One\\" yet, you won't want to know what's next. <br /> <br />I noticed that some previous reviews had a few objections about various technical and political aspects of the movie.  Yes, there are plenty of bullets flying around while everyone is flying around.  However, I dismissed that as an aspect of the latest in aviation technology as would exist on Air Force One.  Ironically, the idea of terrorists hijacking Air Force One is more believable today than when the movie came out.  My pet peeve with the movie has to do with the failure to properly explain how an inside member of the President's circle could be the one to aid and abet this takeover.  In the several times I've seen the movie, this matter has never satisfactorily been explained.  However, these are mere anomalies when compared to all of the thrilling, action-packed adventure that is the essence of \\"Air Force One\\".  It is truly one of the great action movies of the 1990's.
0671034065|5.0|This book had a unique plot and was funny at the same time. <br /> <br />One of my favorites by Linda Howard. <br />
B0000640SA|2.0|Film noir with a unique narrative device: the story is told starting at the end in short segments in which the story moves forward. Between each of these segments, there is a black and white segment of the protagonist on the phone with an unidentified person. How these segments fit in time with the rest of the story isn't clear, even on repeat viewings. <br /> <br />The narrative device simply makes the story too confusing for a movie audience. DVD viewers can replay segments to catch details and clear up confusion.  <br /> <br />Whether they will want to or not is another question. This film has an overabundance of murder, delusions, revenge, greed, drugs, lies, manipulation, tatoos, violence, and despicable acts of one kind or another to qualify as film noir. But even in film noir at least one of the characters should deserve some sympathy. In this movie, none of the characters do. In the end, we are asked to believe that the main character would choose to become a serial murderer killing people that, at the time he makes this choice, he knows have nothing to do with the attack. His only reason is just to give his life some semblance of a purpose. Nothing in his background makes this action believable. <br /> <br />Even puzzle fans who persist in trying to understand what is going on will be frustrated by the movies plot holes, red herrings, and inconsistencies.  <br /> <br />The main character is supposed to remember everything that happened before the attack, and not be able to make any memories since. But he doesn't remember some things that happened before the attack, and he does remember some things afterward that are inconsistent with his supposed mental condition. He remembers exactly what his mental condition is. How? He can't remember if he's chasing someone or if they're chasing him, but he remembers that he drove to the location, where the car is, how to get back to it, which car it is and where the keys are. How? He remembers that he's supposed to takepictures to help him remember. He remembers that he's taken pictures, and where they are. He remembers that he needs notes to help him remember and he remembers that he's supposed to look for those notes.  <br /> <br />The real story of how his wife died is not credible. It's inconsistent with his mental condition after the attack. It's simply not believable that someone in his mental condition would have been in a position to do what he supposedly did. In addition, one of the other major characters' actions are inexplicable. That character keeps turning up with no apparent motivation, knowing things that the character has no way of knowing.  <br /> <br />Tatoos are important in this film. The protagonist believes most of the tatoo \\"facts.\\" In his condition, how does he remember to believe them? The protagonist has a tatoo that says \\"never answer the phone.\\" Notes are pushed under his door telling him to answer the phone. But why? Why not just knock on the door? So what does he do? He answers the phone. And why is not answering the phone important? He's so easy to dupe in person, the phone doesn't create any bigger threat. Yet he spends much of the movie on the phone.  <br /> <br />At the end of the movie, he's shown in bed with his wife. He has a tatoo that we've never seen before. It says: \\"I've Done It.\\" Presumably he's imagining this. But imagining this tatoo is completely inconsistent with his mental state and motivation at the time.  <br /> <br />Memento is a challenging trip. But ultimately it's a trip not worth taking.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I put off seeing this movie, but I'm glad that I finally did.  It was gory, but it WAS gory and AWFUL that Jesus died, not only Physically but Emotionally.  I give it 4 stars because some parts were a little too gruesome for me.  But I thank Mel Gibson for putting this film out.  It's a reminder for me to thank God for all that he has done for us.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am one of the many people excited about this release of these movies on DVD's and I do not care if Mr. Lucas feels like adding his \\"improvements\\" to the movies for DVD release.  I do find it quite irritating that so many people are whining about it...or not buying it.  All I have to say is...it's your loss.  If you want to be one of the masses who doesn't own a copy of this set...then go right ahead.  But stop griping about it and find something else to complain about. Do you honestly think that you not purchasing a copy of this DVD set is going to hurt Mr. Lucas in any way?  LOL.  I say kudos to George for finally getting to make the movies he intended.  I still enjoy them.
B0000QX0WO|5.0|Def Leppard's High and Dry is a true rock and roll album, from the opening track Let it Go to Me & My Wine.  It was the last album to feature the original guitarist Pete Willis before the band brought in Phil Collen.  Most people would only be familiar with the standout track Bringin On the Heartbreak, which is a highlight, but for longtime Def Leppard fans the fifth track Switch 625 is a brilliant instrumental track that features the talent of Steve Clark who died in the late 80's shortly after the Hysteria world tour.  This album to me is just as well written and preformed as its popular sucessors Pyromania and Hysteria.  The album has catchy rock lyrics with hard and fast guitar riffs, that truly make the album worth listening to over and over again.  Tracks 11 and 12 are not on the U.S. release and they are not found on any other album.
B00005JN7O|5.0|The soft-focused, noir-esque, 1930s-style retrofuture of \\"Sky Captain\\" is a visual feast to behold, unabashedly revelling in obvious influences as Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" and B-movies of the 1930s.  Amid some viewers' complaints of underdeveloped characters and dialogue, here's a movie for those us who truly \\"get it.\\"  Granted, this movie is not for everyone.  But quite frankly, it has a lot of balls. <br /> <br />And dirigibles!  And exploding dirigibles, at that!  And giant robots!  And... <br /> <br />But I digress.  The Question is: Why should you see this movie?   To put it simply, it will be unlike any other movie you've seen recently.  I want to see more movies like this.  I want to see more movies that take chances. <br /> <br />This is a movie for those who enjoy dirigibles, giant robots, ornithopters, dogfights, Manhattan, searchlights, Gwyneth Paltrow's cute over-bite, \\"larger than life\\" heros, the German language, mad scientists, industrial complexes, ray guns, dinosaurs, B-movies, film noir, steampunk, Ridley Scott's Los Angeles, the aforementioned \\"Metropolis\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\", China Mieville's New Crobuzon....The point is that this movie takes you somewhere quite different.  \\"Sky Captain\\" harkens back to a particular time and particular genre of truly escapist movies.  And plus, the exploding dirigibles were just freakin' cool.
B0001I561E|5.0|Ever since the Little Mermaid's unexpected success, Disney's been cranking out films every 2-3 years and after Beauty and the Beast they worked on Aladdin. Was a smash hit despite not having any name actors, although Robin Williams is recognizable, and a bit of controversy with one of the opening lyrics. What was also different was the approach to the story. Disney always had films that were self-contained: no pop culture references. Here Genie is doing imitations left and right and it was quite different but yet it worked. <br /> <br />Aladdin, a street rat(basically a less-offensive word for \\"bum\\"), dreams of living in a luxurious lifestyle without having to steal for food and avoiding guards while doing so. Jasmine, the sultan's daughter and princess, wishes to choose whomever she marrys without it being forced unto her. Chance encounter makes them run into each other and he falls in love(of course).  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Jafar is after a treasure in the Cave of Wonders but not just anyone can enter, it has to be a \\"diamond in the rough\\", which just happens to be Aladdin. Aladdin is trapped in the cave but stumbles upon an hyperactive Genie in a magical lamp and realizes that the way to get to Jasmine is to make himself a prince. Jafar finds the lamp however and Aladdin must stop him without the use of the Genie. <br /> <br />Before the realistic Lion King(well as far as talking animals go, there was no magical powers a la Cinderella or 50 story villains like Ursula or Maleficent), Aladdin continues with its sense of wonder where anything can happen. Props has to be given to Robin Williams, who goes as fast as rapper who drank too much coffee, he's non-stop here. The soundtrack is incredibly catchy but oddly there was something different in this one. Ursula had Poor Unfortunate Souls, Gaston(Beauty and the Beast) had well, Gaston, and Scar from Lion King had Be Prepared, yet Jafar didn't get his own song. Considering Disney usually likes to get the villain tosing, that was odd but oh well. Also Jonathan Freeman, voice of Jafar gives a very good performance here. <br /> <br />I don't know if Disney's doing it's entire catalogue with the Platinum edition stuff(they're almost up to 40 already) but this was a good addition. On the way we have Bambi in march, I believe Cinderella next year, then Jungle Book, 101 Dalmations and Lady and the Tramp I think in the coming years. I hope they do the Gold releases too(Robin Hood especially, Hercules, Mulan and the Aristocats) but in october, you should check this one out too.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I have wanted to get around to writing a review of this terrific movie for a long time. I have kept hearing a voice telling me to honor the effect this movie has had on me in the past year. On this sunny morning, I have decided to do just that! <br /> <br />I was first introduced to Moulin Rouge when it first came out. I saw it with someone to whom I was engaged at the time. We went to see it because we missed another movie. I fell asleep at the time. It just seemed so much, too many visuals and very schizophrenic. I couldn't handle it. I assumed the movie epitomized everything that I think is wrong with American culture and Hollywood.  <br /> <br />Flash forward to this summer. My new partner mentions to me that we should rent this movie. I have a violent reaction and absolutely forbid it! My arms are flailing, I'm stopping my feet on the ground and yelling \\"NO WAY!\\". In all of her wisdom, my new partner ignores me and rents the movie anyway. I am annoyed. She asks me why I am so against this movie. She says that I totally misunderstood the movie the first time or worse. She suggests that my ego was preventing me from appreciating the movie's religious significance. I am a Buddhist and she is a christian unitarian type. She mentions some reviews of the movie I should read. I read the reviews on here and the one on Hollywood Jesus dot com. I am blown away! I am almost ashamed at my blindness and my obvious unwillingness to be stretched to greater understanding and awareness. I was being a total stubborn snob and my partner is just much better at suspending disbelief.  <br /> <br />This movie has made me better able to appreciate the teachings I follow in day to day life. When I react badly to what Hindus call the manifestations of the Kali Yuga, I remember this movie. I remember that my disposition must be one of courage and lovingness and not just hot air, judgment and anger.  <br /> <br />I am definitely interested in learning more about Baz Luhrmann, Craig Pierceand Catherine Martin and their own spiritual journeys. I am officially intrigued how Hollywood people could produce one of my top 5 religious experiences in the past several years. That list includes meeting the Dalai Lama at a benefit for Tibet House! <br /> <br />Thank you to the makers of this movie and to all of you out there who possess the insight, wisdom and patience to have helped me see it for what it really is underneath. Especially my partner. <br />

B000000W5P|4.0|With \\"Some Girls,\\" the Rolling Stones proved it was possible to make a record that rocked hard within the context of the Disco era. This disc features both uncompromising blues and disco-inspired pop. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" is an excellent example of the former, while the opening track \\"Miss You\\" is an outstanding recording that is heavily influenced by the musical mood of that time. The Punk influence on \\"Some Girls\\" is wildly exaggerated, although \\"Shattered\\" is the exception to that argument. It is important to note Ronnie Wood's significance on this album, as the band benefits greatly from his presence. Generally, \\"Some Girls\\" is yet another proof of the Stones' remarkable consistency to deliver great recordings throughout all stages of a career that now spans over fourty years.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|If you are looking for fun and exciting entertainment, then look no further because nothing is better in that department then this.  This is by far one of the most entertaining films ever made.  Its got great action, great story (hey theres more story in this then anything from Stanley Kubrick or Akira Kurosawa), good performances (although they could have been alittle better), comedy, drama, suspense, great visuals, and thrills and fun to burn.  Unquestionably one of the best action films ever, and definetly one of the best times you can have watching a movie.  If you dont like this movie then you just dont like having a good time, so quit life (whats it worth livin for if you dont have fun).  9 out of a 10, cant wait for a sequel, and more from Sommers, he knows how to make an entertaining movie.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Heartbreaker was very OK, but I was astounded at Adam's progress on Gold. It is so varied w/ country, rock, retro, cool pop -- but somehow holds together as an album due to its spirit and tone. Fantastic -- one of my top 20 of all time.
B00005JN7O|5.0|This movie was the best I've seen in probably over a month.  It was just a lot of fun.  A mix of Metropolis, Day the Earth Stood Still, Rocketeer, Independence Day and so on.   <br /> <br />I'm sure you know the premise.  Nearly everything in the movie other than the actors themselves was CGI.  Made for some very interesting backgrounds and visuals.  The movie had a very retro-future look with the kind of Rocketeer attitude.  The story was kind of serial-like, in that we just hopped from one outlandish adventure to the next, but it's all in good fun.   <br /> <br />Various robots keep attacking cities around the world.  \\"The militaries are indisposed,\\" so Sky Captain (Law, a free-agent superhero of sorts) must come to the rescue.  Polly Perkins (Paltrow) is his ex-girlfriend reporter who's trying to get the story of her life.  Ribisi plays Dex, the Q to Sky Captain's Bond who is kidnapped by the evil forces behind these robot attacks.  Sky Captain and Polly follow them to Nepal, rendezvous with Frankie (Jolie), the general of a secret military base, and then they all go after the villain. <br /> <br />It often feels like a movie from the 30s or 40s with dry one-liners and even the last line of the movie.  It kind of ends before you think the story's done, much like older films.   <br /> <br />All in all, a very fun and entertaining movie.
B0000029GA|5.0|this cd is hot. 10 years later and its still one of the best albums.  the lyrics is crzy especially on NY state of Mind. my favorite song is Life's a bitch. ppl say the beats arent good but they just ghetto.  ive been a fan of nas ever since this album. one of the best rap albums of all time
B000002KYR|5.0|Is it possible to buy at ticket to a show and not see ZZ Top?   Only if at that time you don't know the music.  I did that by the way, on their Tres Hombres tour at the UH show with other headliners.  I was am Wishbone Ash fan and woundup on stage with the start of that event.  Be that as it may, I later became an avid ZZ Top fan, partly a Texas thing, mostly just real quality musicianship. <br /> <br />The first time I heard this was in Sugarland, Texas when building Clemens High School.  It came over someones boom box......Da da dah da dah duh.....Got me under Presure.....immediately I was asking who is that and before the week was out I had my copy on LP. <br /> <br />The whole record is just a matter of musicians trying to create new and interesting and fun combinations of sound, video, inspiration to themselves and other..........one of many of ZZ Top's celebrations and experimentations in postive and memorable thoughts, events, and experiences in life. <br /> <br />Also recommended  Afterburner and Recycler (invisible 7 eleven :))
B00003CXCT|1.0|Star Wars will remain my favorite trilogy of all times.  George Lucas will remain one of my most despised directors of all time.      There was a time when we all believed that George could do no wrong.  He had brought us one of the most incredible stories to ever play out on the big screen.  It had all the action, drama, suspense you could possibly want.  It brought out a whole generation of fanatics.  Star Wars brought a smile to a persons face just to think it.  Think about how many times you have seen the trilogy.  Did it ever get old?  Did you ever stop marveling at the sheer magnitude of it?  Did you ever stop loving it?    Did you feel that same sense of joy and wonder watching the \\"Special\\" Edition?  Was anything lost with the new CGI?  Better yet... did you really feel that everything was right with the world once you saw that Han didn't shoot Greedo first?  Did you even care?    Do you think George Lucas cares what you think/feel about \\"his\\" movies?  Short answer... No.  The man has said as much in his interviews.  He doesn't care what fans want.  He doesn't care that we made him his money.  He doesn't care that we like the originals more.  He doesn't care about anything except his precious money.    For those of you who fall for his \\"vision\\" spiel.  Take a look at the latest two installments of the Star Wars universe.  That's his vision.  Aren't you glad he didn't have CGI available for the original trilogy?    Write it down... In less than two years the original versions of the film WILL come out on DVD.  Lucas will say that it's for the fans, but don't believe him.  This is a ploy.  He knows that if he brings out the originals first people won't buy the \\"Special\\" Edition.  If he brings out the \\"Special\\" Edition first then people will jump on it for the love of the series.  Then he'll bring out the original because many of those same people will buy it again.      Don't fall into his trap.  Wait... it will come.  I'm just glad that I have my originals onVHS still.  It's the only reason I still have a VCR.
0393312836|5.0|I had seen the Kubrick film about a gazillion times, and finally broke down and read the book.  Glad I had.  The opening line of the book instantly caught me, and did not let go till the last hair raising sentence. <br /> <br />Before going off on the story, I want to comment on Burgess' intense writing style, which has reshaped my own view of what writing should be.  In addition to the Slang used by Alex (Nasdat) There is a wonderful natural fluidity to his language that grips the reader instantly. <br /> <br />The plot, it seems, is intertwined so that reader must identify with any one particular person at a time, but this changes rapidly.  At one point you find yourself loving the character Alex, then the next moment you realize he's a total jerk!  The police are appreciated till their evil is revealed.  The old man F. Alexander seems to be compassionate till you realize he plans to kill Alex.  You want to smack Alex's parents for not having raised their kid right, yet you pity them for fearing their own sons evil tendancies.  It's bothersome because you don't have any character that you can latch onto. <br /> <br />Alex is evil.  Let there be not mistake.  The state is evil.  The kind old man is evil, driven so because of Alex.  By the end the evil has not left.  It just simply went through a cycle.  In short, this book scared the crap out of me, Bog blast it!
B0002KVUKW|5.0|This film is a great adventure film with non-stop action laced with humour. The cast is wonderful. Kate Beckinsell is lovely and smart. Hugh Jackman makes a virile and sexy younger version of the classic Van Helsing from classic monster films. The special effects are breathtaking along with the sweeping soundtrack. I highly recommend this film for great entertainment. It would not be surprising if there is a sequel.
0767803434|4.0|Harrison Ford continues his top billing streak with this exciting film about terrorists hijacking the President's plane.  He proves his star power in the title role.  Gary Oldman is errie as the leader of the rag-tag group of thugs.  He is one of the best villans in Hollywood today.  Check it out!
B00005JN7O|4.0|This movie has the look and feel of the Sci-Fi movies from the 40s and 50s--except that the effects are much smoother, thanks to CGI technology.  This movie also has the look and feel of a film noir: most of the scenes are dark and shadowed, and lighter scenes have sepia overtones.  The few instances of bright color are startling in contrast. <br /> <br />I won't give away the plot, but I will say that I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  It's one the better adventure movies I've seen.  Do remember to suspend your disbelief at the door, however.  This is, after all, a 40s-style adventure sci-fi movie, and as such, many non-historical things happen. <br /> <br />Speaking of non-historical things, I was disturbed that I couldn't figure out what year (or around what year) the action was taking place.  I'm guessing that the year is 1939, because we see _The Wizard of Oz_ playing at Radio City Music Hall and _Wuthering Heights_ on the marquee of another theater.  Both these movies were released in 1939.  Also, the Second World War doesn't seem to have started yet; the US is still talking to Germany and the Hindenberg III is docking in New York.  Yet the characters repeatedly refer to the First World War, which implies that the Second one had taken place.   <br /> <br />The acting was just fine.  The actors played their parts just as a 40s cast would have done.  I might not have chosen Gwyneth Paltrow as Penny Parker, but there was nothing wrong with her work on this film.  Angelina Jolie had fun playing with sci-fi military equipment and baiting Paltrow's character.  Jude Law put on a performance unlike any other of his I've seen.  Who knew he could pull off an action hero? <br /> <br />Go see the film.  Enjoy it.  It's not an Oscar contender, but it isn't supposed to be. It is meant to be an enjoyable, entertaining, escapist film.  And it does its job admirably.
0765301598|2.0|Where others have attacked this series of books for not living up to the original Dune, I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Sure, they don't compare with Frank Herberet's masterpiece, but then I never expected them to. On their own, the first two novels were good \\"Star Wars\\"-style space opera; however, this book was just not as good. It was almost as if the authors wanted to get the series done and over with so they could move on to other ideas. I think it also lacks in continuity between the other novels. The first two books featured the same characters and followed within several years of the Jihad timeline. This book jumps ahead several decades and introduces and entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of Vorien Atreides who survives because he received life extending treatments from his father. Near the end, the book seems rushed and falls flat. What started out as an OK continuation of the Dune saga fell flat with this novel.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|You're probably thinking, \\"how does he get \\"Romeo & Juliet\\"? This tale of cross species lovers has elements that borrow from Shakesphere. The themes are so universal that they could also apply to the prejudice that whites and blacks (or Asians)might face if they intermarried during the Civil War or anytime before the Civil Rights Movement. The first time I saw it I really, really disliked it. Why? It seemed as if it was too deriative. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. When I went back to watch it again with a a friend I really enjoyed \\"Underworld\\" for what it is.<br /><br />Selene (Kate Beckindale)is a Deathdealer--her job is to hunt down and kill Lycans (Werewolves). It seems the two species have been at war for thousands of years. At one time the Lycans were slaves watching over their masters the Vampires while they slept and protecting them in times of turmoil. That changed due to some pivotal event in the past.<br /><br />Things change when Selene while on a hunt for two Lycans discovers they were hunting a mortal (Scott Speedman). They weren't doing it for food or sport. Instead Lucian (Michael Sheen)has some special purpose for this human. When Selene begins to suspect that Kraven (Shane Brolly)who leads the vampires might have betrayed her kind, she takes it upon herself to discover who this human is and what his importance might be to the Lycans.<br /><br />Stylish and well directed by Len Wiseman from a story conceived by Wiseman (a former art director on \\"Stargate SG1\\", writer Danny McBride (\\"The Outer Limits\\" and a stunt co-ordinator/actor on many film projects) andactor/stuntman Kevin Grevioux (who also appears in the film as a Lycan), \\"Underworld\\" may borrow its look from \\"The Matrix\\" but the themes in the story are as old as the Greek tragedies.

B00005JN7O|5.0|Not since The Fifth Element has a film combined state-of-the-art effects with an original and captivating storyline.  Many people were expecting another rendition of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and I hope they're pleasantly surprised.  Without question, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow looks great.  The CG sets looked real and authentic and the actor truly appear to be inhabiting this virtual world.   <br /> <br />The story is very fast-paced as well as intriguing and captivating.  It reminded me of the Indiana Jones films.  But the biggest surprise here is the brilliant job Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did...especially Gwyneth.  She truly looks, acts and sounds the part of a 1930's reporter.  Angelina Jolie's role is fun and spunky, but unfortunately it's more of a glorified cameo role.  I'm sure there'll be a sequel and hopefully we'll see more of her character.   <br /> <br />There was not one moment in the film where I was bored.  This is a film for people who are looking for entertainment, which it delivers in truckloads.  I recommend it to anyone and I truly hope it fares well in theaters.  It certainly deserves it!

0446677450|5.0|My God. My best friend told me about this book 4 years ago, my roommate told me about it 3 years ago, my mom told me last month, and my financial advisor told me last week. Yet, for some reason, I waited until the day before yesterday to actually buy it and hear it. (I bought the audio version) <br /> <br />It is an excellent book! It demonstrates how important it is to pull youself out of the trap of work hard/spend hard pattern. Although I kind of knew it, but no one has said it as clearly and easy-to-understand as he did. <br /> <br />The reason that I gave this book a 5-star is not because I know how to be rich tomorrow. It is because of his ability to bring a clear vision and direction to me about a concept that most never tries to understand. <br /> <br />Some of the investment decisions that I have to make all of a sudden became really easy after I read the book. By being able to understand what the differences are between assets and liabilities after reading this book, I have more confidence about my financial future because I know what I need to do to reach financial freedom. <br /> <br />Whatever that we do in life, we have to continue to learn to succeed. And whatever that we learn, we have to keep an open mind to really gain wisdom from those lessons. <br /> <br />Keep an open mind and know that this book's goal is to show you the direction to where you might want to go, then, you will maximize your gain from reading it. <br /> <br />I got the audio version of it, and finished it in 3 hours. I have gone through it twice, and am listening to it for the 3rd time now. If you are very busy, at least get the audio version like I did and listen to it in your car, on the bus or in the gym. <br /> <br />Trust me. It is worth much more than what on the price tag of this book.
0060934719|5.0|I wasn't that enthusiatic when I picked up Stardust; I was pretty disappointed by the sloppy ending of Neverwhere.. but anyway, I loved it! On the back of the book, Gaiman thanks CS Lewis, Lor Dunsany.. but I think Stardust is actually closest in flavour to the original Grimms Fairly Tales, complete with talking hares and a leaf that doles out excellent advice. Highly, highly recommended!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Once again Michael Moore plays fast and loose with his agenda driven version of the truth.  His slick editing and questionable interviewing techniques often leave one with more fiction than facts.  Moore is very aware of his audiences biases and plays upon them for maximum effect.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Yeah, this little girl has alot of power, but I think sometimes this movie is interpreted by our own cultural filters-ie, girl power vs. bad, old patriarchal grandfathers- too often.  This movie to me is more about being \\"called\\" than simply \\"girls can do everything boys can do!\\" Pai has been \\"called\\" to the role of leader, you can see it in her being really-and it simply takes time for her Grandfather to see it. I think Koro's actions in many ways are understandable-he is watching his people drown in poverty and the effects of colonization. It is THROUGH tradition and heritage that he sees a solution for his people's demise. And at the end when he says to Pai, \\"forgive me, I am just a fledgling, new to flight,'\\" it is then that we fully understand that Koro recognizes that calling too. Also, I have a Maori cousin who gave me a good insight regarding the part where Pai is nuzzling the whale-in Maori culture, when you pass breath through the nose as a greeting, you are in effect symbolically inferring that you would give your life-in the form of the breath-for that person. So, when Pai does exchange her breath the whale, she is ineffect saying she would exchange her life for that whale. Thus the whole part where she says she wasn't afraid to die-because basically she had already made that commitment earlier with the ritualistic breath exchange. AWESOME MOVIE-all kids should see this movie, as well as adults! There's nothing like making them understand that they are all \\"called\\" to higher callings in their own ways...
B000286S8S|2.0|I have been fortunate enough to obtain numerous live bootlegs of VH from the early years and can compare them to the post 1984 era.  All I can say is that this band was probably the best in the World.  Perhaps they should re-name this album 'Best in the World until 1984'?  DLR was 50% of VH's persona, no doubts.  I have listened and watched all their Hagar material, and as far as cliche rock goes, one era was influenced by a genious and the next era was influenced by a has-been.  I have also watched the DVD 'VH the early days' and in my mind it demonstrates how the band relied on DLR for their stardom.  This compilation is alright, but there are a hell of alot of raw VH missing.  I thought they would have included more from 'Van Halen 2' and Women and Children First'.  Seeing as Eddie is free again and DLR is doing nothing, maybe it's time for a proper reunion so that the old VH magic can be rekindled, because it ain't too late!  I say this because the Hagar tracks on this comp are as limp as f***!
B0002S947K|5.0|I heard this album on a compilation CD. Ther only song I heard was \\"Trouble\\" and I thought it was great. Basically he has the singer/songwriter sound down perfectly. He incorporates the orchestra in many of his songs and has Sara Watkins from Nickel Creek singing angelic harmonies and playng a beautiful fiddle on two songs. His debut album is very impressive and should be recognized and respected by the musical world.
0345457684|3.0|This book has two obvious sides - SF and Noir/hard-boiled detective story. On a SF-side, it succeeds mightily and definitely deserves a lot of praise. The world of future, built around the \\"digital human\\" technology, is carefully constructed, well-thought over and overally convincing, providing a good setting for the story as well as some thought-provoking ideas. The author is obviously familiar with the works of William Gibson and puts a certain effort to avoid direct parallels (for one, nanotechnology is never mentioned at all). Morgan is less concerned with low-life cyberjockeys but more with upper-class politicians and businessmen, so the angle is quite different from Gibson's first trilogy. (Perhaps as a wink to the reader, Morgan names his protagonist Takeshi, thus linking this one to Johnny Mnemonic via Japanese actor/director Kitano; or maybe Morgan is just a fan of his.) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book is also quite flawed, and most of the flaws are on its Noir side. The story itself is not terribly original and has been done many times before in many variations. Mind you, this is still times better than Dan Simmons' Joe Kurtz stuff (why oh why, Dan, money ain't everything... but I digress). More to that, our man Kovacs is not very interesting character, nor is he behaving consistently, conveniently being smart or stupid, brute or samaritan - whichever suits the author at any particular moment. Other characters fare little better in that department. The plot, suitably convoluted, is at times contrived beyond the point of comfort. The whole thing, including the ending, feels very formulaic. <br /> <br />So, what do we have at the and of the day? Rather ambitious SF book, that is still at its heart only a murder mystery. And herein lies its biggest flaw. I can't help but feel that the story doesn't justify the setting. All this technology leading nowhere. Still, the style is here, and I do hope that next time Richard Morgan aims higher.
B000089CJI|5.0|I have been listening to \\"Recycled Air\\" non-stop on my iPod for almost a week now.  I love it!  The reviewer who mentioned that this is for children of the 80's had it so right.  I'm high school class of 1990 and am an absolute sucker for good synth-pop.  This is marries the best of 80's synth-pop with a 21st Century sensibility.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This movie is one of the best Stephen King adaption. And what a wonderful story. I can watch this movie over and over again. I also thing it's cool that Wil Wheaton's character grows up to be a writer, and so does Wil Wheaton in real life. I recommend this movie to everyone i know. Dont let this one pass you by. You'll regret it if you do.
B000089CJI|3.0|I would recommend this album but not as one that I listen to straight through.  I found it to pretty even - on some songs it seems like the vocals and music just don't seem to mesh in enough to make powerful music (like Clark Gable).  Also, as was pointed out in another review, though the chorus is catchy, the lyrics in Sleeping In seems somewhat cheesey and forced.  However, the album is filled with enough gorgeous pop songs to make it worth.  It's strongest tracks include The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Recycled Air, Brand New Colony.
B00000IP4H|3.0|The Good:<br />- Drum Legend Gene Hoglan is in the band.<br />- Eric Peterson isn't placed in the shadows of another guitar player, since he is doing the guitar work himslf.<br />- Shows another side of Testament.<br />The Bad:<br />- Chuck Billy's death metal voice isn't great. Mind you, i'm not a big death metal fan in the first place. (with the exception of Death.)<br />- Hoglan's drum skills aren't shown very good on this album.<br />- Demonic is slower.<br />It is an alright album, but certainly not one of their finer ones. If you are new to this band, don't start your collection here.
B0002I831S|4.0|I normally only review books but I thought this set was worth making a few comments on. First off I like the packaging and the menu graphics are stunning. However I do have a slight quibble (*no that's not a tribble with the shakes !!!) and it concerns the quality of the video. Now I'm in New Zealand so this may only apply to the Region 4 set, but I have noticed that by comparison with the individual DVD sets the picture quality on the box set is not as good. Five years ago when Paramount released disks with two episodes on I managed to get a couple, and it was stated they were substantially enhanced by digitally reprocessing the original masters. I've compared the visual images of those disks and found them to be much cleaner, with all the scratches, hair lines, and film marks removed. When I looked at the box set version many of the episodes don't appear to have been cleaned up at all, in fact I have commercial videos from a few years back that also have superior picture quality to what appears on this set. I am quite frankly shocked by this and would therefore warn fans to think about what they really want before buying this set (*though as I mentioned this may only effect sets produced outside the US). It is entirely possible that different regions used different masters, which would account for this variation in quality, but personally I think this is a blatant misrepresentation of the product by Paramount since clearly many of these episodes have not been digitally enhanced to the same level as the previously released individual disks. I have always been a huge fan of the Original Series so naturally I am not sorry I brought this box set, from a financial point of view it is still the best way to purchase this material, but for die hard fans I would also suggest you think seriously about buying your favourite shows separately. That way you will get the full advantage of the digital enhancement process. Live long and prosper !!!!
6301174240|5.0|I'm making this brief, though it may come across as a current suggestion, but given the context and heat of the King of Pop's death, one would expect somebody to finally release this long lost gem stuck in the analogue world to be re-seen in its respective quality as of 2009/2010 on blu-ray or hell just DVD in general. My waiting begins now.  And like everyone else, i saw it for the first time back in 1989 or so when i was little, and i had the vinyl for MJ's Bad album, so i was highly into him back then and mesmerized.I recommend buying his album Bad first, then watching this film for the full effect that we all had gotten back in the 80's.
B00028HBKM|3.0|A couple of thoughts: <br /> <br />First of all, the fact that the movie was in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew drove me crazy.  I really dislike subtitles, I (personally anyway) find them distracting and they tend to force me away from paying attention to other parts of a film that I like to look at.  <br /> <br />There was no story-telling at all.  Now granted, since it made money hand-over-fist, this may be a moot-point in a lot of ways.  However, if you were coming from a family that wasn't particularly religious, I couldn't help but think that you'd have no idea who the characters were or what was going on. <br /> <br />I had heard people mention that they had thought that `Braveheart' was a warm-up for what Gibson did on TPOTC.  I disagree with that on every possible level.  `Braveheart' was a better film, and not by a small margin. <br /> <br />I had also heard mentioning of \\"The Media's\\" over-hyping the violence in the film.  I didn't think this was at all overstated.  If anything, it was more violent then I expected.  Now, being such a fan of horror, action, and science-fiction movies, I'm the LAST person in the world to complain about a movie being violent or bloody.  I do think though, that it hit a point where the brutality in the movie ceased to have a point in forwarding the story.  It almost seemed to be violent, just for the sake of being violent.  Yeah, I know, and then I get to hear the argument \\"Well, that was what he really went through.\\" Well there's a difference between conveying the point that he was tortured and seeing every minute of Christ BEING tortured.  I felt (in several instances) that Gibson had made his point and just continued to, visually, beat-up his audience.  With a running time of over two hours, you probably very easily could have trimmed about five or ten minutes off and given your audience a little bit more of a mental break.  <br /> <br />Monica Bellucci is an OUTSTANDING Italian actress that's given virtually nothing to do.  <br /> <br />I LOVED the scenes with Mary reflecting back on her life with Christ as a child and a young man, but there aren't NEARLY enough of them.  For me, they were the only points where I felt emotionally invested in the movie.  Other then that I felt like I was watching a one-legged man in an a$$-kicking contest.  <br /> <br />I didn't see where the film was anti-Semitic.  I thought it was clear that the Jewish hierarchy simply felt that its authority was being usurped and that it was the actions of several individuals in power that started \\"the conspiracy against Christ\\" (for lack of a better term) and not an indictment of the ENTIRE Jewish faith.  I think some people are just a bit too sensitive.  <br /> <br />As far as being a \\"traditionalist\\" movie, I didn't think there was enough script to make a judgment.  It didn't appear to shoot off in any bizarre directions, and I never found myself saying \\"Hey ... that didn't happen like that.\\"  What exactly would a \\"non-traditionalist\\" film look like?  <br />  <br /> <br />So on the whole maybe two and a half or three stars out of five.  It will certainly give people something to talk about (which in of itself probably isn't such a bad thing) but I didn't find myself the least bit moved or fulfilled on a religious level. <br />
B00005ASHM|3.0|...but this collection of lush lovely pop tunes, however momentarily charming, is NOT, I repeat NOT ANYWHERE NEAR The Greatest Record Of All-Time! And if you think I'm just a sore Beatles fan, well I can name you at least a dozen records by other artistes that are way better. <br /> <br />There! Rant aside, let me get to the music. Like I said, it's lush, pretty and enjoyable, with a good melodic sense, lovely harmony singing and some nice arrangements. A decent display of songwriting talent. \\"Sloop John B\\" is a song I've always loved, \\"God Only Knows\\" is hauntingly beautiful, especially the harmony singing on the fadeout. \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" may have some really cringeworthy lyrics, but it's a merry little romp. \\"You still believe in me\\" has a lovely melody. The rest of the songs, though, are mostly nondescript - nice, but never stepping beyond that \\"nice\\" into \\"great\\" or even \\"good\\" territory.  <br /> <br />The instrumentals are dull and annoying, and the little dog'n'train sample at the end of \\"Caroline No\\", oddly enough, actually fits in better on \\"Sgt.Pepper\\", where similar effects were used at the end of \\"Good morning, good morning\\" - used sensibly, used in conjunction with the subject matter of the song. Out here, I can't figure out what the Hell it's supposed to mean. It's pretty weird that the effect appeared on \\"Pet Sounds\\" first, 'cause even if The Beatles lifted the idea from Wilson, they at least knew how to put it in the right place! <br /> <br />Now getting down to business. In summary, I have to say that the whole \\"Pet Sounds\\" hype machine is obviously a last-ditch attempt by the American critics and media to suggest that they might actually have a band worthy of combating those \\"evil\\" lads from across the Atlantic (;-). But I'm sorry to say, folks, the Brits got ya beat! (And I'm not a Brit, so don't accuse me of flag-waving). <br /> <br />Look at the Beach Boys themselves. Wilson was an admirable tunesmith. Yet Andy Partridge of XTC (Yes, a British band, a band that I love to distraction, and a band that, to my mind, has produced several masterpieces that surpass \\"Pet Sounds\\" by miles) draws obvious inspiration from Wilson's songwriting style and beats him at his own game! Check out \\"Humble Daisy\\" from XTC's \\"Nonsuch\\" and you'll know what I mean. Pure Beach Boys sound, but better than the Beach Boys! <br /> <br />Lastly, I'm no technical expert, so I can't judge whether the studio tricks Wilson employed were truly ground-breaking or not, but whatever those tricks were, I'm afraid he used them a little too much, resulting in an album that starts sounding dreadfully monotonous and dated after a while. Maybe it was a landmark record in its time, but hey so was the Velvet Underground's banana album, and that still sounds as vital and venomous as it must have done back in '67! This album has not aged well, and Brian Wilson, for all his merits (and all the praise from Paulie) is far from being the Great American Talent.
B00005K9LN|5.0|Judas Priest's sixth album, British Steel (1980) is a classic in all respects. Though not their ultimate album (that would be 1990's Painkiller), this one is almost as good as that and Defenders Of The Faith (1984). The band had one of their biggest hits with this album. If by now you don't know that song and call yourself a Judas Priest fan, go kill yourself. Though \\"Breaking The Law,\\" which is naturally the song I am referring to, is not their best song, it is definitely one of the three highlights of this album, with it's telltale guitar riff and bassline (which I can play). As short and simplistic as this song is, it's incredible. Also, \\"Rapid Fire\\" is a brutal speed metal tune, the DOTF hit \\"Freewheel Burning\\" sounds sort of similar. And \\"Living After Midnight\\" is almost happy. It IS in a major key, but the lyrics aren't exactly peppy. Anyway, when I heard this song on classic rock radio in gym class, I was headbangin' 'till it ended. Overall, this album rules, and I definetely recommend it to fans of Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Diamond Head, Raven (not that damn pop songstress-the NWOBHM band), early Def Leppard, Motorhead, and other British heavy metal acts. ROCK HARD, RIDE FREE! (Judas Priest)
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I avoided this movie because I couldn't buy into the fact that Ashton Kutcher was in a serious role. But with some coaxing from my mother I gave it a shot and WOW! It was so good.  I saw the theatrical release first then the alternate ending.  I think the theatrical one was a lot better.  Evan still got to live.  But there is a valuable lesson learned- before you do something that is going to alter everything THINK IT THROUGH!!!  It is seen that from many alterations there was some tragic consequences.  Since then I've learned that you gotta pay attention to everything.  The smallest thing can make such a huge change.  It was just strange when its played by Kutcher who is the funny guy who punks people.
B0002I831S|4.0|I, fortunately, waited for Paramount to release TOS in series box sets rather than going through the painful and expensive process of buying all 40 original DVDs, knowing the studio's basic greediness backwards and forwards by that point and expecting just such an upgrade.  Still, for an upgrade it could have been better.  The bonus features are OK but where's the blooper reels (waiting for future season boxes)?  And why is the set so expensive compared to season box sets released by other studios?  Even at a discount price I paid much more than usual for a TV series season box.  There has been no visual upgrade from the remasters done in 1998 but I don't think there will be a need to, as the 40-year old series looks about as good as it can get, I think.  The sound seems to be slightly improved, though. <br /> <br />Of course, Star Trek: The Original Series' first season has passed into the annals of TV history as a cultural and almost historical milestone.  The first season is almost uniformly regarded as TOS's finest, with nary a weak episode (excepting the inexplicably edited and weakly acted \\"The Alternative Factor\\") and a host of seminal ideas, themes and characters introduced for the first time into the mass global consciousness.  The whole idea of a racially mixed crew (and look closely, it's not just Sulu and Uhura--the crewmembers who walk the decks are truly racially mixed in *every* way) was radical enough, let alone the ideas that were represented in each script.  Phasers, Klingons, Romulans, Vulcan neck pinches and warp drive were introduced into our vocabulary for the first time and have stuck for nearly a half-century, and have become so common that most people have forgotten how revolutionary they were at the time.  The attempted rape scene between Kirk and Rand in \\"The Enemy Within\\" may still send a shiver down the spine even given the context of TV-shock value today.  Overall, highly recommended, although Paramount could--and should--have done moreto this perennial classic. <br />
B00003CXCT|3.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said before, so I'll let the numbers do the talking... <br />As of this posting, there were 1129 reviews out there, with 37% rating the re-worked versions 3 stars or less. <br /> <br />If we were talking about Episodes I and II, a 63% \\"approval rate\\" would be a good thing, heck it will be a great thing, but this is the \\"original\\" trilogy we are talking about! <br />How is it possible that what had been universally rewarded as the best and most beloved science fiction movie series ever falls to a 37% disapproval rate? <br /> <br />This should be a sure and clear sign to Mr. Lucas that he has made a big mistake by reworking the movies. As I said ealier on this post, the numbers speak by themselves. <br /> <br />
B000063DHL|5.0|Maiden never disappointed in the 80's, and this is certainly no exception. Iron Maiden's sixth album, Somewhere In Time (1986), is perhaps the greatest progressive metal album of all time. It's no Number Of The Beast, but what Maiden CD (aside from that) is? NONE! Anyway, SIT is probably their third best album in my opinion. It features some things that were new to the band at the time: the incorporation of guitar/bass SYNTHS into their music. Overall, it all works out pretty well, they almost sounded like Fate's Warning had moved to England, which is good. And now, of course, the three highlights of the album. \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" is another prime example of how metal albums open well. It starts out as a slow duel of guitar vs. g. synth, then turns into a speed-metal blowout! Track 2, \\"Wasted Years,\\" features one of the greatest guitar intros ever done by the band. It also features one of the greatest choruses of all time. And \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" is an eerie mid-tempo heavy rocker with one of my favorite bass-lines ever. Overall, this album is definetely recommended for Maiden fans, as well as various prog-metal acts, like Kings-X, Fate's Warning, Dream Theater, and Andromeda, among others. ROCK HARD, RIDE FREE! (Judas Priest)
B00000I8BX|5.0|ive recently got a ton of albums and while listening to them 3 stood out. sinner by dp, machine by static-x, and obsolete by ff. as i looked at the tracks EDGECRUSHER caught my eye. i love the remix so i put it on and realized THIS IS THE BEST SONG OF THE CENTURY LIKE NOTHING ANYONES HEARD BEFORE, now the remix soundeds demented. another thing cool about obsolete is if u look in the book, theres a story that includes the songs, for example \\"EDGECRUSHER stops in an abandoned building to rest himself. as he falls to sleep on a cold, flat floor, he repeats the ame words that he does every night\\" then its the lyrics for descent. buy this cd the songs will grow on you and eat u.
B00005JN7O|4.0|This is a 21st century impression of a 1980s impression of a 1930s impression of the 21st century. Unwinding that, it's a story about a future that was imagined in the 1930s of 1940s, in the black and white Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers films. The visual style is reasonably true to that era, down to the black and white look. That was the look that's been retroactively colorized since the 1980s, sometimes badly, and that paint-by-numbers color style is used here.<br /><br />The style works, and I expect to see a lot of imitations, even though this is already an imitation of the colorizers' imitation of real color movies. The palette included only a warm brown, for skin tones, and a blue, for sky, buildings, and most everything else. The reddish lipstick on Polly, the female lead, may have been the only exception to that two-dimensional color scheme.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the acting was pretty two-dimensional as well. For example, once Polly's character was set, she'd wear those spike heels everywhere, even through forests and rubble-strewn disaster sites. Frankie (Angelina Jolie) put words to my thoughts upon seeing Polly for the first time: \\"What's THAT?\\"<br /><br />Well, I just came for the adventure and for the incredible visual style. The adventure was passable, and the style has the advantage of novelty. It's a popcorn movie, modern and retro at the same time. If that's all you expect, you may like it.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen Brothers have done some pretty audacious movies, but this may just be there most audacious yet, as they take on the great book, The Odyssey, and do a might fine job of it in depression-era Mississippi. George Clooney is Ulysses, but of course one can't take him too seriously in the role.  He gets some fine help from John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, as the three convicts make their escape from a chain gang.  Along the way we are introduced to a strange assortment of characters (What would you expect?) held together by a well-conceived storyline that doesn't fail to deliver a fine ending.  T-Bone Burnett provides an inspiring Folk and Prison Blues soundtrack that resurrected James Carter singing Po Lazarus.  While the movie has more than a passing nod to Sullivan's Travels, it moves along at its own brisk pace, as the hapless trio seek its redemption via a series of obstacles that would have made old Preston Sturges smile.
0060920432|5.0|I have been looking out for this book for a year before it appeared at the bookstore again. I had found a book, entitled Good Business by the same author and found his concept of flow intriguing. I supposed Good Business is a great book but I wanted to understand the basic concepts before reading about how they apply to business.<br /><br />Flow is a truly enlightening read. As I mentioned in my previous post, I read Zen in the Art of Archery and Flow is the perfect follow-up to it. Zen in the Art of Archery helped my understand flow in terms of photography. Ever since, photography for me was a spiritual practice. Flow elaborates on the concepts introduced to me in Zen in the Art of Archery. This book de-mystified flow experiences and made me aware of the various methods, conditions and activities which can bring about joy.<br /><br />Csiksentmihalyi succeeded in describing the apparent paradoxes of Zen experiences. This book, although filled with findings from numerous modern studies is a must read for seekers interested to learn more about Zen and thus, life.
B00005A3KS|5.0|I've seen this movie so many times I have compiled a list of best lines: <br /> <br />1. hang ten Pappas, like totally rad dude! <br />2. stay off my wave <br />3. get me two <br />4. punk, quarterback punk <br />5. aka Luptan Pitman <br />6. you bother me! <br />7. we're just gonna f**k you up <br />8. via con dios <br />9. air got dirty, sex got clean <br />10. can't paddle to New Zealand! <br /> <br />I'm sure there's more, just can't think right now.

0735619670|5.0|The main focus of the book is Code Readability, abstraction and single purpose routines, although he does cover so much more, but he does seem to always come back to those 3 points. Secondly, Every conclusion he makes is backed up with one or more studies supporting his conclusion, this really lends credibility. So as stated in my title, if you are a serious programmer (wether new or expereinced) you can gather much information from this book that you can apply to your own programs to make them of higher quality.      Further, Another part of the book I found useful was his \\"Further Reading\\" section. Unlike some books, Steve really gives you a good list of books to read and explains why he is recommending it. Also at this end of the book he lists a series of books that is required reading for his company. These books are listed in a series of more intermediate books to more advanced books. So if your looking for an ordered list of books to buy, that section is very useful.    Lastly, If after reading this book you look at your programs and you immediatly think \\"Coding Horror\\" it is ok, I did too.    Note: This is an edited review, my last one (which was only a line) was found to be very unhelpful (no doubt) and so I have tried to make it more helpful.
B00009ATKS|2.0|I'm not familiar with Mogwai's other albums, but when I stumbled upon the gorgeous -I Know You Are-, I was intrigued and wanted to know if the rest of the album was just as good. -Hunted By A Freak- was strangely pleasing and -Golden Porsche- was depressingly beautiful as well. The rest was so incredibly monotonous (-Boring Machines- being the worst) that they all feel like filler! -Stop Coming To My House- and -Ratts- start without any memorable melody, again, and both end in a cacaphony that has no resemblance to music whatsoever. Mogwai has to get way more creative on the next album to win me over.
B000268QB2|5.0|If you like the single \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" then you'll like this cd, because the rest of the songs are that sort of tempo. The songs are pretty, a little melancholy. I like the singer's voice, it's very nice - sweet actually. It has those kind of songs that you can hum a long to, without ever really listening to lyrics - it's that catchy.
B00061QK02|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters just this pass summer, I was GREAT! I could stop laughing. I really enjoyed all the camios, I ain't gonna say who they are, but I can say they are real famous. I especially like Steve Carell (Daily Show With Jon Stewart) Part in all this, He is very funny. I has every thing from ingnorance to dog punting. The only bad part part is the fact it is taking forever to come out. Definatly buy this movie.
0446530891|1.0|But the second half is pure bad. We have a good idea here, but David Baldacci couldn't figger out how to carry off the one critical ingredient of a good thriller... making it believable. You will need a large notebook just to write down all the inconsistencies and dumb ideas that he uses to piece this book together. Finally you will become irritated by all the little stupidities his hero and heroine continue committing. Still, you can move to the last chapter or two to discover how it ended without missing any of the previous 250 pages.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I have to say that I am impressed with this band.  I first heard Rammstein in the movie XXX (which isn't as bad of a movie as some think) and I then found myself looking for their material on sites such as this.  I absolutely love their song Feuer Frei! and quickly adapted to Sonne and Mein Herz Brennt.  That's when I bought this cd.  After listening to the whole album for the first time I only really cared for the first 5 tracks, which out of 11, isn't that great.  Once I heard the tracks some more I began to like all of them. <br /> <br />Now I don't speak or understand German (and I'm sure most don't in the US) so I went online and searched for the translations.  I can safely say this...the lyrics blow!!!  They are terrible, terrible lyrics and I only like a few.  The reason I'm sticking with them is because 1) I really like the sound of the music, which is the point I suppose and 2) I don't hear what they're saying anyway.  <br /> <br />I will be buying their album Sehnucht and possibly Herzeleid.  My suggestion to anyone who wants to give Rammstein a try, listen to Feuer Frei!, Sonne, Mein Herz Brennt, Ich Will, Engel and Du Hast before passing judgement.  Just try not to think about what the lyrics are/mean.
B00003CXCT|1.0|That Mr. Lucas now has none of the creative fire that gave us the original trilogy is evident. In 1977 a 6 y.o.'s imagination was fired up in a way that nothing before or since equaled - without any of the vaunted effects or scene butcherings that Mr. Lucas now thinks are so integral to the film that he wants nothing to do with them. For Lucas to say that it's too expensive, too much trouble, and something he's completely uninterested in to remaster the handful of scenes it would take to give the *fans* what they want is the heighth of creative death. He no more understands why he has the money to masturbate with than he understands why the Greedo scene isn't just one scene but an entire character's butchering.<br /><br />All it would take is releasing a 8 DVD set with both the \\"director's cut\\" and the theatrical release to make *everyone* happy, and even make Mr. Lucas more money than he already has.<br /><br />I only hope my VHS tapes hold out long enough for my infant daughter to see, because whatever Mr. Lucas thinks he's doing for the kids, isn't.
B0002TT0NW|2.0|ok.......the director for this one.......STINKS!!!!!!!!!  There are many things in this movie that make me say WTF!  First off, lupin has no grey hair, dumbledore looks feeble because his costume looks like he is wearing a noghtgown, to many missing sceens, and what was with that pedgleum in the great hall!  There was nothing about it in the books why add it.  Someone could get hit with that thing.  The grounds change.....looks good but why would you do that......the grounds are way to differnt!  Alfonso Cuaron should NEVER do another Harry Potter movie.  He nearly destroyed the story by remaking it in his own image.  I going to buy it only so I have all the movies to date.....but it was a sad attemped at a great story.
0553208845|5.0|I read this book three times. I read it first in 1973 when I was in psychology graduate school and I was 22 years old. I was a young seeker of truth and the book was perfect for me at the time. I read it a second time in 1982 when I was taking a course on Buddhist imagery in Asian art history. I read it a third time in 2001 when I bought it as a present for my college age nephew and wanted to read it again before giving it as a gift. I think it is a masterpiece. When I was 22 it served as a guide. When I was 50 it confirmed the path.<br /><br />The story parallel the life of the Buddha, who was also named Siddharta. The story is the classic journey, both outward into the world and inward into the soul. Siddharta is reared in wealth and priviledge and yet like many insightful persons, recognizes that this is a fragile and illusory reality and social class construct. He breaks with his father, an act that all of us must underdo to became truely individuated adults. Gifted with male beauty, intelligence, and warm charism, Siddharta makes his way into the world. He joins wandering ascetics and masters hunger and cold. He becomes a hedonist and lover to a beautiful woman while becoming a successful merchant. These were not wasted years. In fact, Siddharta learned deep lessons in his soul through his love-making. He learns the mystery of becoming one with another body during passion. But he also learns that worldly sexual love fades and attachements are hard to break. He becomes a ferryman, gaining wisdom from the tides and river banks.<br /><br />This book is a masterful union of Eastern mysticism and the psychology of Carl Jung. It does not identify or endorse a particular path. Rather it endorses the thoughtful and experience laden journey of life, a natural process of growth and loss, attachment and release. Written as a short parable, it can be read in one evening but I feel sure you will remember it for a lifetime.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|fiftybucks, youre a ranter.  You got the lyrics wrong.  \\"Don't wanna be an american idiot/one nation under a new media/and can you hear the sounds of hysteria/the subliminal mindf*ck america\\".  Great single, I'm getting the album
B00004WGY9|2.0|I am somewhat confused. I thought that this would have all the tracks that were on the Geno LP but, alas... no.<br />Only 4 tracks from \\"Geno\\" made it on to this CD:<br /> 1) Geno<br /> 2) There, There My Dear<br /> 3) Keep It<br /> 4) I'm Just Looking<br />The other tracks on this album are taken from other sources. Now, please do not get me wrong... I really like anything by Dexy's Midnight Runners; it just cheeses me off that I have to end up purchasing 3 more CDs just to get the original track listing from the \\"Geno\\" LP. Also, \\"The Horse\\" (from \\"Geno\\") is not available anywhere on CD!... thank you.

I agree that the originals are plenty good just as they are. One thing ... they are Mr. Lucas' films. If he wants to use new technology to change his films. That's his right. As consumers, we have the right to buy or not buy the product. I am looking forward to these movies.
0393035158|4.0|I have been reading everything I could find on the subject of terrorism and Islam since 9/11.  I have reread the Qur'an, Hadith and Sunnah as well as dozens of books and everything I could find on the internet. <br /> <br />I could find very little with which to disagree in Mr. Harris' book.  It is entertaining and lays his feelings out without the typical beating around the bush and failure to call a spade a spade that permeates the media, political commentary and writing today. <br /> <br />The book is interesting and covers what is undoubtedly the great issue of our time with clarity and directness. <br /> <br />I recommend it to anyone interested in the issues of terrorism, religious doctrine and faith, or the age old battle between faith and reason. <br /> <br />Bill Stenwick
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Well most of what you've read in the other reviews is accurate, except that is is a film about redemption, plain and simple - hence the title, Shawshank (the prison) Redemption.  The characters imprisioned in Shawshank are guilty of one crime or another, whether Red's armed robbery, Brook's spending his entire life in prison (only to commit suicide upon his release) or Andy's neglect of his wife for his career.  BTW, the last part of Jeff Shannon's review is INCORRECT, but I won't ruin the story for you. <br /> <br />To say that Morgan Freeman's acting in this film was bad is laughable.  Get a life - only three people saw \\"Dreamcatcher.\\"  Morgan's sensitive portrayal of a repentant armed robber is exemplary, and his onscreen paring with Tim Robbins is a masterstroke of casting and chemistry.
B0001I562I|5.0|If you have not seen Disney's \\"Flight of the Navigator,\\" then you have not seen a great Disney movie in your life. Others have come close, like Disney's \\"Angels in the Outfield\\" with Christopher Lloyd. However, when young David Freeman falls into a revine just to come back 8 Earth years later, this is where the whole movie begins.  <br /> <br />I will admit that it does have a slow start, but after David climbs out of the revine, the movie just shoots like a spacecraft from there, literally. Hey, if you are looking for a famous celebrity in this movie, young Sarah Jessica Parker from \\"Sex in the City\\" is in this movie. Rent it, buy it, do whatever you have too. Just do what I have told countless others to do, see Disney's \\"Flight of the Navigator.\\" It's the best comedy ever!
0679720200|5.0|Albert Camus is without a doubt a literary genious, his book The Stranger was extremely well written and tells an extremely poignant story about one man and his extestential life.  We follow the character mersault through events in his life, where he seems simply not to care for much of anything.  When mersault suddenly finds himself killing a man, and sitting before trial he realizes his beliefs, that we are all alone in the world, we all die, and without hope we can truly live again.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I love this movie. Tarantino really captures the spirit of the \\"old school\\" kung fu movies, while weaving an original tale of revenge utilizing an almost entirely female cast. The music is great, the cinematography is better, and the women are hot.
0321213351|5.0|Based on its title alone I had high expectations for this book. It didn't disappoint. The book takes two of the most important advances of the past decade (patterns and refactoring) and puts them together into a whole that is definitely more than the sum of its parts.  <br /> <br />I've read many good patterns books and have been applying patterns to how I think and talk about software since the original \\"Design Patterns\\" book in 1995. However, something was always missing. Through my consulting work, whenever I introduced patterns to a new team they would take quickly to the idea and patterns would become part of how they thought-but only when designing, not when coding. Since we spent more time coding than designing, patterns played less of a role than they could have.  <br /> <br />This book does an excellent job of bringing patterns into coding, rather than relegating them just to design discussions. As the author points out, \\"patterns are best viewed in the light of refactoring and that they are destinations best reached by applying sequences of low-level refactorings.\\" <br /> <br />This book has earned a permanent place on my bookshelf. That is, when it's not open beside me as I program. Very highly recommended!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|A horror movie freak's DVD collection is not complete with out this wonderful movie. This genera-blending flick brings together some of the greatest horror characters in movie history. Imagine this: The wolfman, Frankenstien and Dracula all smushed into one action packed movie.       This movie stars Hugh Jackman as the famous Van Helsing. Many people may think that this is just a stupid plotless movie that just throws these monsters together but it all really connects beautifully. Comedy, romance, horror and action: this movie has it all! Plus the very good looking Hugh Jackman beating up some of the most famous monsters ever! A great sound track, stunning special effects and a very well thought out story line adds to it.
B000000WG4|5.0|I first heard this music, late one night in my room, when I was 17 years old, the same age as Mike Oldfield when he wrote this. This was in the days of 'Album rock', and when I first heard that haunting melody, and then the war and play of the Dark , almost demonic sound, and the Light bursting forth triumphant; in my mind a horse and a knight and a lady come suddenly into a clearing and see the castle glistening in the clear morning sunlight...the weirdness, ...like this was a musical message from another place, another era, another world...where did this glorious music come from that held so perfectly the dark and the light? I immediately knew, at that tender age, that there was a lot more to 'reality' that I andeveryone had thought...and young Mike O., had somehow channelled this music through the pain of his adolescence.... Ommadawn was even better, taking music to a building exotic spiritual climax...Tubular Bells II,...hopeful, happy, optimistic, with still a little daemonic energy thrown in...TB III, the most incredible orgiastic climax ever, building to that enormous metallic/resonating strike of the Bell, like the biggest bell on earth, on the top of the mountain...the soundtracks to my life...wherever Mike gets his stuff (I don't believe his personality writes his music, but rather, some greater part of reality comes through him, and his person is a fantastic instrument---guitar-player...)<br /><br />What! wonderful music! There's none other out there like Mike Oldfield...
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|When you listen to this you feel like you're listening to music from the 80's or something like that. And that's good. This band's really good, one of my best CDs.

B00003CXCT|1.0|It may have been Lucas' story, but the fans made it \\"STAR WARS\\". <br /> <br />For every person that has ever read a book and then seen the movie and they didn't quite match up or those who've seen a remake and thought the original was the best...I agree with you. <br /> <br />I guess I will continue watching my VHS tapes and wait for STAR WARS to come out on dvd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|Hayden Christiansen (however his name is spelled) as old Anakin????  Greedo shot first????  JAR JAR Binks?????  Lucas did it again!!!!!!  The idiot damaged the saga with the horrible Phantom Menace and the mediocre Attack of the Clones.  I will keep my original VHS tapes of the REAL trilogy and not this crap.  For REAL fans, the best option is to transfer the VHS tapes to DVD/CDROM until Lucas does the right thing and relases the REAL trilogy on DVD, not his botched special edition attempt.  As for the best trilogy on DVD?  Lord of the Rings, by far.  When the original Star Wars Trilogy goes on sale then it will be a close race, but not the crappy special edition.  All of you who think this version is better than the original probably paid to see Gigli on theaters, get a clue!
B00005JN7O|5.0|This movie is great fun! Part Indiana Jones, part 1930s screwball comedy a la Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, and part gee-Wizard of Oz. The story is pretty basic - great looking heroes & heroines saving the world at breakneck speed - but it's the way it's done that's impressive. Reality is not the point. Surreal? Hyperreal? I don't know what to call it because I've never seen anything quite like it. The visuals are so gorgeous they're almost hypnotic. The characters aren't psychologically complex but there's a mythic tone to their simplicity that works. And the action never stops so don't blink! Take your family, take your friends, a splendid time is guaranteed for all
1591840562|5.0|I run a large center for entrepreneurship at the University of Florida.  I bought this book on a Friday, read it over the weekend and on Sunday ordered copies for our 50 person board of directors and for 80 students in our internet MBA program. <br /> <br />He says so eloquently what I have felt and had trouble teaching.  He cuts through the stodgy tradition of writing a business plan and hoping. <br /> <br />In my view, it is worth the price for the first and last chapters.  The real meat in between is like a free bonus.  Throw in the excellent quotes and I don't see any MBA student in entrepreneurship not reading this book.
B00028HBKC|3.0|There has certainly been a great deal said about this movie. I was very much looking forward to seeing it and I have to say it's a at least a little disappointing. First of all I don't care much for reading a movie. In fact one reason I watch a movie is to escape reading. Perhaps that wouldn't have bothered me so much if the subtitles were left on the screen long enough to read which often they aren't.  <br /> <br />The acting isn't anything really great but then exactly how is an actor supposed to bring any insight into a character when the majority of the movie is comprised of painful and anguished expressions of a man who's been flayed alive?! The fella portraying Jesus of Nazareth does a pretty decent job of expressing sincere pain especially in the throws of death but watching the contemptuous and sneering/laughing expressions of the Roman army becomes somewhat tedious, repetitious and a bit annoying.  <br /> <br />The general consensus seems to be it's either a glorious masterpiece or a hateful/bigoted piece of filth and I'm very glad to disagree. This flick isn't anywhere near as bad as much of what the industry puts out these days but neither is it the best thing I've seen (even this week). It's worth seeing but not worth raving about or being indignant over.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I've been a professional guitarist and music teacher for over two and a half decades. I listen to guitar music day in and day out, ranging in style from Luis de Milan (1536) to Leo Brouwer and Alan Holdsworth. It isn't difficult to observe that almost all music that has survived the test of time has had something valid to say: some of it expresses well the particular fashion/taste of the period; some successfully pushes the existing musical boundaries; and some is just uniquely personal to its creator.    As a musician Jeff Beck belongs mostly within the last of the preceding three groups. Examination of his output suggests it would be hard to argue that he created any new genre, but whenever he experimented in a new field he always sounded unmistakably true to his own unique musical identity. I also believe that a creative performing musician can receive no greater compliment.    The hallmark of Beck's style is melodic fearlessness. This boldness sets him apart musically from perhaps 'superior' technical and 'harmonically informed' peers, especially those of the so-called 'improvisational' based jazz scene. Beck's playing is instantly recognisable and is almost devoid of cliche. Jeff Beck only ever sounds like Jeff Beck. On the occassion that he ever employs a tired phrase of (say) Chuck Berry's, it is in such a manner or in such a place as to turn it on its head or throw new light upon it.      To those wondering whether to add this CD to their collection I recommend that you bear in mind Duke Ellington's words - \\"There are only two kinds of music: good music and bad music\\", because this CD belongs unquestionably to the first category. All instrumental, it contains a variety of styles - including ballad, reggae, funk, and rock - read the other reviews for the details. And finally, please don't ever pretend to have any inkling of what Jeff Beck is about, or what he is capable of, without being familiar with this particular album.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Understanding that this movie was not meant to focus on the life of Christ, but simply his death and sacrifice for humans, I think this movie did an excellent job.  <br /> <br />It changes the account from the fairy-tale, sunday school version where adults tell children \\"Christ died for you,\\" and all the children nod their heads and think 'how nice of him.' This movie brought me to a drastic realization that Christ did not simply, for lack of a better phrase, drop dead, but instead went through enormous pain and suffering because of my personal sin.  <br /> <br />I once heard that even had I been the only one who Christ was trying to save, he still would have gone to the cross for just me. This movie really helped me put the entire aspect of his crucifixion into a real perspective and gave me a new amount of respect and understanding for what Jesus's act meant for me in my life.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|With over 400 reviews here,I doubt that I can add much...But this is such an uncommonly good film,I'm going to throw my two cents worth in anyway...There are people in this world for whom the phrase \\"First Love\\" will not evoke memories of a person,but rather a song.For whom music would become not something they simply enjoyed,but more something that they lived for...A song is not something they listen to,But something they live in.Some will go on to write and record,others to write about those that do.Others still, will find any way to involve themselves in the magic,And almost all of them will amass large record collections as a consequence.Not because they are \\"record collectors\\",but because they need to have every song that ever meant anything to them at close reach.It makes no difference whether it's Josey and The Pussycats or John Mellencamp,if it speaks to you-It's all good!This film is about those people, and that music. Cameron Crowe's brilliance lies in his ability to,in this film give the music a face. thus,making it the central character while the principal characters all play out their own individual relationships with it.--Think \\"Something About Mary\\" with Rock'n'Roll in the Cameron Diaz role,and you'll get a handle on this film.Crudup,Fugit,Lee,McDormand,and Hoffman are all flawless in their roles,but it is Ms.Hudson who will knock you off of your feet.One scene in particular that stands as a testimony to both Her skills as an actress and Crowe's as a Director is when her character boards the plane..Hudson is able to convey so much and so many emotions just through Her face, that you are simply blown away.I've watched a great many films in my life,but I've never,ever seen anything that I would consider PERFECT--Until now.If you're expecting SPINAL TAP,look elsewhere.A tell-all expose on this band or that,Not here.If you are looking for an example of filmaking at it's absolute finest, buy this and make it a permanent and prominent part of your collection.Just be sure to get the Director's Cut,as waaayyy too much landed on the cutting room floor in the theatrical version.(which IS included in this set)...Hey,have I ever steered you wrong?n.Just be sure to get the Director's Cut,as waaayyy too much landed on the cutting room floor in the theatrical version.(which IS included in this set)...Hey,have I ever steered you wrong?
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who's album Who's Next is one of rock n roll's all-time classics.Great showmen as well as great songwriters,The Who really shines on this album.The keyboard drinched Baba O'Reilly opens the album with a bang!Other highlights, as well as radio staples include:Bargain,Behind Blue Eyes,and Going Mobile.The most kick butt song of the album has to be Won't Get Fooled a Again.Who's Next is one of those great albums that just flows from start to finish, every song is as important as the one that proceeded it, and for those of you that have heard Limp Bizkit due Behind Blue Eyes,the original is the only version to have,crappy bands need to leave these classics alone!

B00003CX95|5.0|You know, this is a remarkable film not for it's historical accuracy but for its epic proportions. We used to make movies about people we knew little about. Joan d'Arc, Chanson de Roland, Arthur, El Cid. People . . . us . . . enjoyed them. Heck. We make movies about The Christ and that history is always controversial. I mean, do we really think that Christ had Stephen Hunter's blue, blue eyes?<br /><br />They were spectacular and as an art form, they were supposed to be. So Gibson, never one to shy away from putting his money where his mouth is, makes the story of William Wallace who led the Scots in a fight for independence in the 13th century. Borrowing not just a little from Shakespeare's St. Crispin Day speech, Gibson speaks in a loud booming voice to the troops at Stirling, asking them to consider the Shakesperean choice, 'lying on their death beds 60 years from now, would you not exchange all those days for the one chance to say 'you may take our lives but you'll never take our freedom!'<br /><br />Historically accurate? Probably not. Poetic license? Most certainly. Great movie? Absolutely.<br /><br />I teach a class in business leadership at a local college. It's well attended and has become popular on the campus. The first day of class I start out with William Wallace's speech to the troops at Stirling. Get's the blood flowing.<br /><br />5 Stars Mr. Gibson. You rarely miss. Larry Scantlebury
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I love foreign films.I get the British humor where most people dont.I like intellectual movies.But this one just stinks.Even the most talented U.K actors cant save this.Gawwwd!It is bloody awful.Gag.Only recommended for insomniacs.*
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I posted many times not on purpose. I did not think the system would do this. I thought it was down and just kept posting. Kind of freaky to see all of them at once. Can I erase them? NOTE to Amazon. Com: I did other reviews and I hope they didn't triplicate too. Please fix your system!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I have wanted to get around to writing a review of this terrific movie for a long time. I have kept hearing a voice telling me to honor the effect this movie has had on me in the past year. On this sunny morning, I have decided to do just that! <br /> <br />I was first introduced to Moulin Rouge when it first came out. I saw it with someone to whom I was engaged at the time. We went to see it because we missed another movie. I fell asleep at the time. It just seemed so much, too many visuals and very schizophrenic. I couldn't handle it. I assumed the movie epitomized everything that I think is wrong with American culture and Hollywood.  <br /> <br />Flash forward to this summer. My new partner mentions to me that we should rent this movie. I have a violent reaction and absolutely forbid it! My arms are flailing, I'm stopping my feet on the ground and yelling \\"NO WAY!\\". In all of her wisdom, my new partner ignores me and rents the movie anyway. I am annoyed. She asks me why I am so against this movie. She says that I totally misunderstood the movie the first time or worse. She suggests that my ego was preventing me from appreciating the movie's religious significance. I am a Buddhist and she is a christian unitarian type. She mentions some reviews of the movie I should read. I read the reviews on here and the one on Hollywood Jesus dot com. I am blown away! I am almost ashamed at my blindness and my obvious unwillingness to be stretched to greater understanding and awareness. I was being a total stubborn snob and my partner is just much better at suspending disbelief.  <br /> <br />This movie has made me better able to appreciate the teachings I follow in day to day life. When I react badly to what Hindus call the manifestations of the Kali Yuga, I remember this movie. I remember that my disposition must be one of courage and lovingness and not just hot air, judgment and anger.  <br /> <br />I am definitely interested in learning more about Baz Luhrmann, Craig Pierce and Catherine Martin and their own spiritual journeys. I am officially intrigued how Hollywood people could produce one of my top 5 religious experiences in the past several years. That list includes meeting the Dalai Lama at a benefit for Tibet House! <br /> <br />Thank you to the makers of this movie and to all of you out there who possess the insight, wisdom and patience to have helped me see it for what it really is underneath. Especially my partner. <br />
B0000042GM|5.0|If there is a more effervescent , idiomatic , innovative and resplendently performance of the Handel Variations , I have not heard it . Katchen emphasizes with colossal scrupulosity the wide doe and the diversity spectre of the orchestral instruments . You must marvel at the technical equipment of Katchen playing .<br /><br />The other outstanding version of these Variations is of Michael Ponti (live preformance)<br /><br />gifted with a major emphasis in the striking and color tone ; but the point to remark is that in both performings the approach is similar ; every one of the Variations must be played as a microcosmos in itself ; with nuance , grace , majesty, powerful imagination, sense of the span and above al ; savoir vivre . If you intend to play with authoritative precision without Mediterranean dewy and radiant mood ; you are destined to fail with these Variations and becoming unbearable for the audience and the listener . Lamentably , there are many of them in the actual market but I think you can guess them .<br /><br />The two Rhapsodies are performed with the highest commitment . Melodic flight and arresting lyricism .<br /><br />The Sonatas are superbly performed . The Sonata No. 3 may find serious matchers with Clifford Curzon and Paul Badura Skoda .<br /><br />The intermezzos are depicted with the adequate illuminating . These intimate pages must be played with the perfect balance of light and shadows ; think in Chopin Nocturnes for instance . Only Glenn Gould gets close to him in the Intermezzo Op. 117 No. 2  .<br /><br />The Ballades may be the weakest works of this fundamental set . Benedetti Michelangeli and Emil Gilels recorded brilliant and eloquent versions.<br /><br />Finally The Paganini Variations find in Benedetti Michelangeli a serious and unbeatable adversary .<br /><br />To be honest , this set is widely recommendable for you , to know the whole and intimate world of Johannes Brahms , the beloved son of Hamburg.<br /><br />Katchen also recorded a powerful Islamey and an unforgettable Rachmaninoff No. 2 .table Rachmaninoff No. 2 .
B0000DJZA5|3.0|After all these years, and with the story of \\"Get Back\\"/\\"Let It Be\\" so well known to Beatles fans, what \\"LIB-Naked\\" SHOULD'VE been is a two-disc set with the following:  Disc 1: \\"Let It Be-Naked\\" and the original \\"Let It Be\\" release  Disc 2: The two Glyn Johns \\"Get Back\\" mixes, both of which still exist.    THAT would've given Beatles fans -- many of whom, like myself, don't go after bootlegs -- a chance to hear the progression of the mixes from 1969 to 2003.      That said, the cleaned-up audio quality is superb and the instruments are so much cleaner now.  But I wish Paul and Ringo had chosen to keep the \\"Get back home Loretta\\" coda to \\"Get Back,\\" instead of the straight ending.
B000002KOJ|4.0|Joni's second album Clouds is a lovely introspective and quiet album. All the songs feature only Joni and her guitar with here and there some other instruments to enhance the mood. The best things about the album are the beautiful guitar tunings Joni uses and the lyrics who are passionate and full of feeling. Her voice is still pure here and she sings mostly in her soprano range. Joni's best known song Both Sides, Now is featured on this record and I cannot express how much that song means to me. If you're a casual fan and want to try some of her lesser known work, this is a nice addition to your collection.
0316666343|2.0|Before I begin the review, let me start with a disclaimer. I am notoriously picky about what I read, watch, and listen to. My taste rarely gels with the mainstream. So while I absolutely didn't like this book, I'm sure most of you will love it. In other words, don't listen to me.<br /><br />The biggest obstacle I could never overcome completely was the main gimmick of the book--the narrator in heaven, or as I think more aptly applies, purgatory.  I could never buy into it because of my own conflicting beliefs and as such, every time I read those parts about the narrator in \\"heaven\\"--btw, how can you have an imperfect heaven?  Isn't heaven supposed to be perfect?--it was like torture for me and I have to admit I skipped a few pages near the end.  I just think all that stuff about watching the people below and meeting her relatives (and pets) \\"up there\\" is cliche and a bad cliche at that.  And since the narrator is only 13 it makes it seem like a young adult book, which doesn't interest me.<br /><br />The other problem, and another cliche was with Mr. Harvey the serial killer.  This guy pretty much comes out of Serial Killer 101, the creepy loner who's quiet and no one would really think would hurt anyone.  If I wanted to read about serial killers I could have picked up \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and it would have been much more interesting.<br /><br />The parts that did interest me were with the Salmon family and their coping with the death.  Those were the times when I actually got involved with the story, but the author kept spoiling the mood by going to \\"heaven\\" or detailing how Susie was chopped to bits and stuffed in a safe.  The best way I can think of to explain this effect is that it's like having an intimate moment with your partner and suddenly one of you breaks wind very loudly--the moment is gone and you can't ever get it back to what it was.<br /><br />I think the most annoying moment is when Susie comes back to life for a little bit.  Now if you could come back to life for an hour or so what would you do?  A. Take revenge on your killer B. Say goodbye to your loved ones  C. Have sex with the boy you had a crush on?  Well I guess if you answer C then this is your kind of book.  Since I wouldn't maybe that's part of my problem.  That was another of those mood spoilers for me.<br /><br />I just wish the book would have focused on Susie's family instead of all these tangents that did nothing but ruin my enjoyment.  A few less characters would have helped too, because I didn't care about Ruth or Ray because they didn't seem to do a lot.  They were there primarily for the event I referenced in my little poll up above.  The characters in \\"heaven\\" never contributed much to the story either; I could have done without them as well.<br /><br />As it was, I just didn't think the story focused enough on the most compelling characters and as such I could never really get into the book.  It had some moments, but they were always interrupted before they could blossom.<br /><br />But even though I didn't like it, I'm sure the rest of you will.  See my disclaimer above.  So go ahead and read it.back to life for an hour or so what would you do?  A. Take revenge on your killer B. Say goodbye to your loved ones  C. Have sex with the boy you had a crush on?

0425166805|5.0|Despite what any of you may think, I rated \\"Chariots of the Gods,\\" as a \\"5\\" because it distracts your mind from the main stream if only for a second. Throughout history, there has always been people not willing to except the way that things are said to be. It is in my opinion that no matter whether you feel that this book is based on facts or not, that it will leave you doubting mainstream theories. I am in no way saying that this book in itself will change anything but that it left me feeling refreshed of the traditional historical writings and made me wonder, if only for a second, if everything is as \\"most\\" people say. Or, could the far \\"history\\" be just a fanciful story?  <br /> <br />I don't know and neither do any of you, so just read the book. Even if you only read it as its own fanciful history, just read it and let your imagination run free for the first time in years.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I, like most true Star Wars fans, liked the original trilogy.  From the story to the special effects which were amazing.  I am not a big fan of CGI myself.  If you look into older movies pre-CGI they came up with many interesting solutions to making the special effects work.  Now, they just insert computer generated objects.  To those who think that George Lucas has the right to change his work since it is his are gravely mistaken.  Once he released Star Wars, it became a masterpiece, an icon in Sci-Fi and thus belongs to the fans in its unaltered work.  Just imagine if Leonardo da Vinci repainted the Mona Lisa because he felt that after all these centuries he could do better?  No, it is a piece of art for its flaws and its perfection.  If you watch South Park, they made an episode where the kids try to stop Lucas from changing his movies.  We need to demand the same.  Don't buy this \\"special\\" edition version that adulterates the trilogy we know and love.
0312995423|3.0|Brown's Digital Fortress is an entertaining but predictable piece of fiction that overcomes Brown's often-over-the-top writing style. <br /> <br />The novel follows NSA head cryptographer Susan Fletcher and her fianc, linguist David Becker, as they attempt to unravel the mystery of an unbreakable code that threatens the very existence of the NSA.  When the NSA's code-breaking supercomputer fails to decrypt a mysterious code, Fletcher is called in to oversee the crisis.  Becker is tasked with traveling to Spain to recover the key needed to unlock the code.  Held hostage by the unbreakable code, Fletcher finds herself immersed in a web of lies within NSA while Becker is stalked by an unknown assassin determined to recover the key code himself.  Slowly but surely, Fletcher and Becker find themselves involved in a much larger crisis that threatens the highest levels of US national security. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress' clever, though somewhat predictable plot is its greatest asset.  The author is clearly skilled at crafting interesting plotlines that weave multiple stories together.   However, Brown's writing style is often melodramatic and unnatural, detracting from the overall strength of the story.  In some cases, supposedly brilliant characters make colossally (and conveniently) stupid decisions that help drive the plot.  In addition to Brown's spotty writing, the book contains several factual inaccuracies that detract from the book.  While the author can certainly be forgiven for not being an expert in cryptography, his lack of knowledge in this area becomes a serious liability in a book that revolves almost solely around codebreaking.   <br /> <br />Digital Fortress is therefore a strange combination: a book with serious flaws that remains enjoyable and easy to read.  Readers with a knowledge of cryptography and codebreaking will find some parts of this book annoyingly inaccurate.  General readers will be able to overlook Brown's lack of cryptographic knowledgeand enjoy the book for what it is.  <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|Watched A New Hope last night,which was jaw dropping in its picture and sound and of the 3 I believe suffers the least from the flannelled one's newest updating,but Empire? <br />There is a new scene when the Emperor tells Vader that the young rebel who destroyed the death star is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.Vader says how can this be,when he already stated at the start of the movie that \\"The rebels are there,and I am sure Skywalker is with them\\". <br />How can he be surprised when the Emperor tells him?What a glaring error.Also,in the Empire credits,voice of Emperor is quoted as being by Clive Revill,when clearly the new dialogue is from Ian McDiarmid.This appalling attention to continuity will sully the memory of this movie forever.For 24 years,I have always thought of EMPIRE as the best film I ever saw.Now I am not so sure.Shame on you ,Mr.Lucas.If it aint broke,Don't fix it.
B000001EKX|4.0|I have owned this album in one form or another since 1977. I must admit that I didn't take to it at first. Not because of the songs, but the sound. It always sounded tinny with a poor mix. And many of the vocals are just hard on the ears in their delivery (\\"Got To Choose\\" the main culprit). <br /> <br />And that is why, here in 2004, I give it 4 stars. The sound has not improved in all the years since its release. But, that's where any criticism ends. Actually, its more of a bitch n' moan at the producers and engineers (then and now) than of the band themselves. <br /> <br />Now when you talk about the songs themselves, that's where it gets interesting. \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" conatins many standards that the band has used over the years, and that the fans adore. Myself included. My ALL TIME favorite KISS song, \\"Parasite,\\" is on this CD and that makes it historically worthwhile just on that fact alone. <br /> <br />The material is strong throughout: The title track, \\"Got To Choose,\\" \\"Let Me Go Rock n' Roll,\\" \\"Comin' Home,\\" \\"Watchin' You,\\" \\"All The Way\\" (THE gem on \\"HTH\\") - all stand the test of time and are still some of KISS' best work. In fact, these songs, along with the forementioned \\"Parasite\\" have ALL been done so much better live than they appear here. \\"All The Way\\" is one chestnut that I heard was part of the 2004 set-list that I haven't heard, but have heard \\"reviews\\" on stating it was great. If you listen to any of these songs from \\"Alive!\\" or any bootlegs or what-have-you, they so outdistance the studio versions it's not even close. <br /> <br />The other tracks: (the excellent and heavy) \\"Strange Ways,\\" \\"Mainline,\\" and \\"Goin' Blind\\" are all very memorable; albeit lesser-known to the mass rock n' roll public that only know KISS by \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" or \\"Detroit Rock City.\\" Too bad, because KISS has many hidden gems on their albums that are just as good or better than the most widely known material. \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is loaded, top-to-bottom, with greatsongs - the only negative to the listening enjoyability is the sound. <br /> <br />All in all - very strong early KISS!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is the greatest act a human has ever done.  Just as will be in 2000 years, people will probably not believe what Gandhi did for the world, people today do not believe Jesus, an even more daunting figure in world history.  This movie advocated peace through faith hope love and forgiveness.  Anyone who denounces this film is only looking for trouble, which is what the whole point of the film was to resolve.  Jesus will live on forever, fact or fiction, he is the greatest moral code we have to live by.
B00005JLO2|4.0|For starters, full disclosure: I feel that Shekhar Kapur is one of the great living film directors, with a star that is still rising.  After watching Bandit Queen, for a moment I was almost led to believe that Richard Attenborough's Gandhi was trivial.  Elizabeth, despite great liberties taken with history, is the most riveting tale of the great Queen ever put to film.     Regarding this story, it is based on the novel of the same name by A. E. W. Mason written in 1902.  It has been done some five times before on film, most famously in 1939.  The 1929 version, a sound-tracked silent film starring Fay Wray from King Kong, exists somewhere but unfortunately has not yet been released on VHS or DVD.    The strength of Kapur's version is really the early scenes of British haute culture.  No one, except perhaps the Irish, knows the British as well as the East Indians do, and it truly shows thru the prism of Kapur's Dravidian camera as it focuses on the brutal nature of British \\"civilization\\".  The British are portrayed in a light of sympathy somewhere between what we would expect to feel for Roman centurions and the Nazi elite.     The problem with this is precisely that Kapur does it so well, leaving you almost without sympathy for anyone involved, including Harry (Heath Ledger).  And it's hard to sit thru a film where you don't like anyone in it.  Not helping matters is the acting of the young Hollywood cast, which, although routinely adequate, is never exceptional.  Djimon Hounsou provides the standout performance here, and Ledger starts to grow on you once he loosens up in Africa.  But by this time the story has already begun to suffer from a slight case of Hollywood hokum.  There are some challenging situations and themes presented, but somehow it just doesn't feel satisfying.  And the ending was too long and too happy.      My recommendation: Definitely worth checking out.  It's entertaining enough and covers some important topics which currently face us today.  Youmight also look up the '39 British version and the '29 Hollywood version (if you can find it!).  Surely Shekhar Kapur has greater films yet to come, even David Lean made a less than perfect film now and then.

B00005JMUA|1.0|...and obviously cares very lttle about making cohesive, thought-provoking cinema any more. Sure, he is known for his collection of Seventies' B-movies, and literally throws in as many references as he can in this one. But if Kill Bill Vol.1 was at least an often funny, irreverent and well-choreographed tribute to the trash films of the 1970s, Vol. 2 is his love note to star Uma Thurman. He manages to capture every angle possible of the wraith-like Thurman and loses no self-created opportunity to get close-up shots of her face, mud-spattered and all.<br /><br />  This film has the look and feel of being a slapped-together mish-mash of outtakes from Vol. 1, with ridiculous B-movie dialogue tacked on, and a story appearing to have been created as a means of tying up loose ends at the last minute.<br /><br /> Awful, simply awful. And this was the same guy who gave us Reservoir Dogs...
B000002U9Y|5.0|Back in the early nineties my friends and I used to hang out and listen to this beautiful CD. Every song on it is very colorful. It always had an early- spring type feel to it and, though the CD's production at that time was very muddy, it had this entrancing atmosphere. Side note: Rick Wright's contributions are not boring at all- especially See-Saw which is a pristine song, the prettiest of the disk and probably of their career, about heartbreak. \\"She grows up for another man- and he's down\\". Live it and you'll understand. Or just buy your stupid Hoobastank album and don't worry about it, idiot.
B00023B1AS|5.0|If you saw only a few of these videos in their heyday on MTV you already know how talented & cool ZZ top is as a band. <br />ZZ Top proves that a great video dosen't make the song, but a great song can be enhanced by the visual aspects of the video. <br /> <br />Watching these videos on a HD TV with surround sound really takes these vidoes to a whole new level. <br />Every ZZ Top fan should own this DVD
B000002I25|5.0|This album set into play the two ingredients that The Doors are most know for.The dark emotional content, and the unique organ sound.I haven't heard either of these two elements pursued to the intensive degree that they're pursued here.Although I'm aware of many artists singing about death and suffering, I don't know of it being approached in such a philosophical manner.Which is not to say that Morrison's poems neccesarily make a cohesive storyline over the span of a whole song.It's more that each sentence is potent as a stand-alone, a poem in itself.I find an artistic similarity in the directing style of film-maker Stanley Kubrick.His films don't always form a singular story-line, but they are full of inspirational and unforgettable scenes.BUT... (Yes, I do feel that capital letters were called for) definetely not all of Morrison's lyrics are philosophical.An equal amount is blatantly sexual (some of which lyrics belong to the guitarist Krieger).And his singing (though it has no leanings towards Pavarotti or Carreras) is fully successful at putting these two contrasting mindsets across.He undoubtedly has a strong presence.(I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's pretention or genuinity.For mine, the genuinity sings to me loudest of the two).<br />The organ style of Manzarek is unreplicated in contemporary music.At least, I've never heard anything like it, except in The Animals' version of \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\".The jazz world's usage of organ is probably the nearest brother.And, although much is said about the blues and jazz roots of this band, very little is mentioned of the classical music influence.Manzarek's organ arrangements resemble baroque era harpsichord and church organ music.I wasn't at all surprised when I found out that he was a fan of, and influenced by, J.S Bach.<br />The drumming of Densmore is very 'spicey' by rock standards.He's not generally credited as one of the greatest drummers of all-time (by the masses, anyway).But, pushing the parcel 'creatively' is always going to mean a trade-off in 'performance' practice.Nevertheless, his performances are still quite excellent.He obviously has an ear for latin jazz, and was very imaginative in applying it to rock music. eg.The \\"Break On Through\\" beat stemmed from a latin tune called \\"Embarcadero\\", which used a quiet brushing, instead of The Doors' heavy CRACK! (or, click!) and speeding cymbals.This here reviewer rates Densmore very highly.<br />Krieger's guitaring is often lazily played underneath the organ on this album.And it's even lazier in concert.It's as if his hands were accidentally numbed at the dentist surgery.But his guitaring comes alive in the well-drilled solos, which are often incredible.He was a bit new to the instrument when The Doors began, so it appears to me that he wasn't so accomplished at the less practiced rhythm parts.But he was an excellent composer, and this intelligence definitely shines through via his choices in notation and phrasing.<br />The Doors hired in session bassists for their albums, which I think were never up to par.I actually love the organ taking the bass-line role at concerts.But the band seemed to believe that the organ wasn't the way to go.An example of how effective the organ's bass could be, is on their live performance of \\"Who Do You Love\\".I think that was the most effective bass work that The Doors ever produced.<br />The Doors linger on the border of complexity and simplicity.For mine, they are as 'intricate' as musicians have gotten without losing their 'rock' status.For others, they were a little too obscure, which leads many to deem Morrison pretentious.Personally I don't dismiss people saying that, as nobody (including Morrison) is totally void of pretention.(Which isn't to say that it 'can't' happen).But I do think that they are missing his genuinity, which is definitely there to be found.In concerts he may have gotten carried away at times.But I find him to have been genuine when it came to his studio performances.(Though I'm not impressed by the new remastered edition vocal track on \\"The End\\".I think the original recording is far more credible without it).I'm aware that non-fans hate when Doors fans call this band 'deep', possibly because the 'depth card' is spread on a bit thick at times (even by the band itself).But this overplay aside, I do believe that 'depth' is a fitting description for what this band set out to do.They didn't excude the common garden variety rock mentality.(And yes, I am aware that they engaged the common garden variety rock 'diet'.But \\"You are NOT what you eat\\", even if cliches say that you ARE).I'm not impressed by the new remastered edition vocal track on \\"The End\\".I think the original recording is far more credible without it).I'm aware that non-fans hate when Doors fans call this band 'deep', possibly because the 'depth card' is spread on a bit thick at times (even by the band itself).But this overplay aside, I do believe that 'depth' is a fitting description for what this band set out to do.They didn't excude the common garden variety rock mentality.(And yes, I am aware that they engaged the common garden variety rock 'diet'.But \\"You are NOT what you eat\\", even if cliches say that you ARE).
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Ok.  If you dont get it its a debate amoung us star wars fans who shot first Han SOlo or Greedo?  SOem say Han because he was better, but some say Greedo because then it would make Han look like a cold blooded killer.  It's oneof those things that no one can resolve like the guys dream at the end of 2001 Space Oddessey (a great film to see if you want to be a director)!  But what does it mean?<br /><br />aLSO.  I saw these films when they came out IN the Theatre int he 90s PEOPLE and they are great!  Everything youve heard is true!!  As a kid, when I saw them, I like most boys would fantasize that i was held captive by the evil Darth Vader and I waited for LUke to rescue me and save me with his LIGHT SABER!!!!<br /><br />Also to the fan review by Donovan...Great news about the Re-imagining (its what they call a remake to you...) of SGt.  Peppers.  What cool news for us Silver Beetles fans (as they were first called), but, um, this is a sight for Star Wars reviews, not music!!!  Get with teh PRO-Gram PE-OPLE!!!!<br /><br />Otherwise buy star wars on DVD and relieve the magic over and over again!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I've seen all three original films and the special edition re-releases in the theatre during their original runs.  I own the original and sp.ed. versions on VHS.  But I ain't buyin' this one simply because it's a work of art that has been bastardized.  Just like with Michael Jackson and is face, George Lucas can't stop altering and fiddling around with his art.  <br />Okay, he came up with the story, and he made the original without any corporate interference, yada yada yada.  It's one thing to be anti-corporation.  It's another thing to be anti-fan/anti-audience.  People loved the originals not necessarily because of the visuals, which were stunning, and still are.  They loved the originals because of the acting and the story, which is why the last two additions to the Saga have been widely panned.  George should swallow his pride and realize that having strong principles isn't always a demonstration of good character.  Sometimes you have to realize that you have to please others as well, and not just yourself.<br />Kudos to Mr. Lucas for having the guts to stand up to the corporate film industry system.  Too bad his new paradigm is just as anti-artist and fascistic as the system he fought against for so long.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore has given the nation's dummies yet another rallying point.  In terms of the historical dialectic this is a good thing.  One must take a long-view of history to suffer the kind of frighteningly arrogant foolishness embodied in the Bush/Cheney bid for power.  More Moore, less Bush!  La lucha continua!
B000089RVX|4.0|The popular radio hits are perhaps the best cuts on this, Evanescence's debut album. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" has one of the most haunting openings of a song I've heard in a while, and the rest is just as dark and intense; I could imagine it working quite well in a movie like DAREDEVIL (though I have not seen the film complete). \\"Going Under\\" is rather more of the same, though more a straight rock-and-roll number. But then there's \\"My Immortal\\", probably the only song on this album in a major key. It is tender-sounding, yet not totally free of tension---the lyrics seem to speak of trying to let go of someone that has been lost. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding the fact that those three songs were the ones I first heard on the radio by Evanescence, they are probably the most notable cuts on FALLEN. As for the rest...well, there is no lack of fine music, particularly the searing \\"Tourniquet\\", the touching and instrumentally spare \\"Hello\\", and the haunted murmurs that end \\"Whisper\\". And yet at times, while listening to the album all the way through, I yearned for a bit more variety from the songs, either lyrically or instrumentally. After \\"My Immortal\\", for the most part it seems like the band is pretty much hitting the same sour note from song to song. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is a tribute to the sheer passion in lead singer Amy Lee's voice in all the songs that FALLEN never becomes merely a sour exercise in unrelieved angst. She really feels the words that she sings---or at least gives the impression that she does---which is more than can be said for a lot of pop acts these days. Her singing is passionate yet resolutely unflashy; she resists the urge to indulge in vocal stylings for style's sake. We the listeners are always involved with the lyrical content, not merely marvelling at the singer herself; and that, in my view, is the mark of a potentially great artist. The band members that back her up are certainly no slouches either, providing powerful accompaniments to Lee's impassioned vocalizations. <br /> <br />Evanescence, in short, shows much promise in FALLEN, which is a very good, if a bit monochrome, debut album. I would definitely like to see what they could bring to different kinds of material---it might be a little difficult to take if they sang these same kinds of songs in every single album. Despite my misgivings about this album's content, though, I recommend this disc to those who are curious about this band and their high-powered and reasonably unique rock style.
B00024BHTC|2.0|From reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk I decided to buy this.  But I cannot see why this band is so popular.  The opening track is as heavy as hell, but the Opera influence makes it confusing.  It's a shame that rock has gone to this level, were you are literally putting garage based riffs into classical music.  The transition in my mind doesn't work.  Nightwish will appeal to people who are basically into opera with thrash metal, but musically it isn't worth 5 stars and I wish I hadn't bought it.  I read a previous review that mentioned Symphony X and as the reviewer pointed out, Symphony X were playing this kind of material long before Nightwish.  The main difference between the 2 bands is that Symphony X are more technical and their guitarist is one of the best around.  Nightwish's guitarist is mediocre at best.  I cannot agree with some of the reviews on this record, but I notice that quite a few are from Europe anyway.  Which I guess makes sense at Nightwish are a European Band.
0440236738|5.0|I read TELL NO ONE first and just read GONE FOR GOOD when we were on vacation.  I could not put it down, except when I HAD to so I wouldn't have a heart attack or stroke from the excitement, or overexcitement as the case may be.  I just had to catch my breath at times.   <br /> <br />Coben is a very talented author, especially at twists and mysteries and hidden secrets... all the things we love.  And the pages FLY as you near the end.  Very very good.  Even better than TELL NO ONE which I heartily, thoroughly also enjoyed.

B00003CXCT|4.0|Nearly 30 years ago in a galaxy far far away, wiz kid film maker George Lucas forever altered the cinematic landscape of science fiction with \\"Star Wars.\\"  A memorizing fairytale, and by now legendary intergalactic epic by which all subsequent like-minded endeavors have had to live up to, \\"Star Wars\\" was the story of the son of a Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his quest to rid the galaxy of an evil empire helmed by Darth Vader. That Han Solo (Harrison Ford) slowly began to emerge as everyone's favorite heartthrob (particularly in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\") didn't seem to hamper Lucas' initial story line - especially since Leila was actually Luke's sister and therefore definitely out as a love interest for the young and viral Jedi in training.  But I digress. With its strident overtones of son eclipsing father in \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" Lucas' saga in space fully realized the box office potential of trilogies. Buttressed by spellbinding special effects, script scenarios that seemed to improve in leaps and bounds with each new installment, and a near mythological following akin to \\"Star Trekkies\\" \\"Star Wars became that rarified cinematic sensation; a marketing genius's wet dream. John William's masterful main title forever changed the musical landscape of movies for the better. One needs only to hear the first few bars of music to find instant connection with a film history steeped in great composers and their great compositions.     \\"Star Wars\\" also made George Lucas a very, very rich (if conflicted) man and gave him a cottage industry to fall back on during his less lucrative career in the late 80s and early 90s. That in recent times fans of the first three films in the series have expressed their overwhelming outrage at the director's need to insert new computer generated footage and \\"update\\" his films is a bone of contention well documented. Press releases from on high have used the logic that the films in totem belong to their creator. Hence, if the creator is dissatisfied with his work he has every right to go back and \\"fix\\" what he feels is inadequate. While no one can dispute that it was Lucas' initial genius that created the legacy, it does seem, at least to this reviewer, that Herr Director relinquished his own personal rights as to what is or isn't a good film after he bestowed his greatness on to the collective memory of the free world. After re-releases in the mid 90s the trilogy went into moratorium so that Lucas could produce the last three installments (actually the first three). Despite the overwhelming advancements in the film industry, none of Lucas' subsequent installments come anywhere close to recapturing the magic of the first trilogy.      And now, at last, audiences finally get to see the reason why on DVD.  These new hi-def transfers are, in a word, mind-blowing. The image is pristine and exhibits a surreal amount of clarity, depth and fine detail. Film grain is practically non-existent for an image so smooth you'll swear you're in the same galaxy with Luke and Co. Colors are rich, vibrant and bold. Flesh tones are miraculously true to life. Blacks are deep and solid. The enhanced sequences in the film have a much more integrated feel to them than they did in theatres in the 90s.  Of the three films, Star Wars exhibits the most improvement in video quality. \\"Return of the Jedi\\" in direct comparison seems a tad weak, particularly in the scenes on Endor in which the forest foliage has a decidedly muddy and touch too grainy feel to it. (Aside: the image is still astounding compared to anything you've likely seen before. Compression artifacts are present but do not distract. There's no hint of edge enhancement or pixelization. The audio for all three films has been cleaned up considerably. Though all three soundtracks are decidedly the product of outdated sound equipment they are remarkably engaging for films of their vintage and will surely NOT disappoint.   Apart from the audio commentaries for each film this collection comes with an extra disc loaded with bonus footage. There are vintage documentaries, new featurettes and a host of deleted scenes and outtakes to choose from. But if you're like this reviewer, ultimately these are mere icing on the cake. The real treat here is to finally have the original Lucas legacy back in everyone's video library, well before Christmas!
B00025ETIW|4.0|A friend turned me on to MCR's first album \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" and they quickly became one of my favorite new bands.  Their sophomore release \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" takes the intensity found on the first album and does a great job of intertwining it with more melody, harmony, and musical advancement.  The music is continually driving and the band does a fantastic job at keeping things interesting with little subtleties such as changing time signatures and using more creative off-beat rhythms.  Lyrically the album is solid although I personally find some of the rhymes occasionally trite or forced.  Still, vocalist Gerard Way delivers the lyrics with the same intensity that made me fall in love with \\"Bullets...\\" and it's easy for me to see past the (very) few lyrics I dislike.  The musical aspect that this band seems to have worked on the most since the first album is the ability to write hooks and overall catchy songs.  Songs like Helena and I'm Not Okay (I Promise) are ridiculously catchy, almost to the point that you'd want to call it poppy.  With I'm Not Okay being the first single it won't be surprising to see these guys being played on the radio and even (gasp) MTV soon.  Overall, a great album well worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />My Standout tracks: Helena, You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison, It's Not a Fashion Statement..., I Never Told You What I Do For a Living
0312117337|4.0|I've just received the deck I bought in Amazon. It is so beautiful. But it is not a real tarot deck, in spite of having been massively based on the Waite deck, and having the same number and arrange of cards of a tarot deck. This is the point: why that compromise, making a deck conforming to almost all tarot standards, and basing it on the Waite deck, but going so far away from those standards in some specific cards, such as that of \\"No-thingness\\"? Being almost a tarot deck creates some expectations which are not fulfilled. Well, maybe I'm a bit too critical; this is the first modern non-conventional deck I analyze. It is really beautiful, and the booklet which comes with the deck is very interesting and inspiring - by the way, I really like Zen Buddhism and other Oriental traditions, that's why I bought this deck. I've not used it for divination by now, and if it works (I think it does), it needs no justifications for its differences from the tarot standards, in spite of not fulfilling all the expectations of enlightening the study of tarot cards by means of comparison.
B0002CX4RM|5.0|This S&D is done in a non-traditional setting by one of the designers of Broadway's The Lion King, depicting the Philistines in an abstract/African way, while the Jews are in traditional period garb.  This is what great theater is all about.  The performance is excellent with great acting & singing, a memorable event worth seeing over & over.  Plus an interview with Domingo. I'd have liked to have seen an interview with the stage designers as well. There's little evidence that this was originally an oratorio.  This is an outstanding performance.
1573225517|5.0|High fidelity is the best book that I have ever read. It is thousands of times better than the movie. Nick Hornby's style of writing has earned him a place in my list of top 5 favorite authors (read the book youll get it). I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of music and/or owns a music shop. This book gives us a frighteningly realistic look into the lives of Record Shop employees. Saying that this book rocks would be the understatement of the year.

B000001FN3|4.0|The Alan Parsons Project's 1975 \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" is a mesmerizing progressive rock concept album into Edgar Allan Poe's most renowned stories and poetry.<br /><br />For being Parson's debut record, he certainly influenced the world of progressive/art rock to come. He went on to make several hard hitting releases, such as \\"I Robot,\\" \\"The Turn of a Friendly Card\\" and \\"Eye in the Sky\\". \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" has always remained a close second to \\"I Robot\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />Some of the stand-out tracks here include stories that I remember vividly from grade school, \\"The Raven\\" and \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\". The opening track \\"Dream Within a Dream\\" features Orson Wells narrating the intro. The most unique piece of music the album has to offer is the five part epic of \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\", spanning roughly 15 minutes. It's an exhaustingly well done piece of music.<br /><br />\\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" is an album that writers, readers and progressive rockers alike will enjoy.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I grew up reading Daredevil and love this DVD. It's not perfect but I don't require perfection in life in order to have a great time. There are those who wanted it to be like Spiderman. It's not (no offense to Spidey) and that's a good thing. It had to be tough making a movie about an unconventional hero like DD but they did a nice job.
0823003035|4.0|I purchase books for ideas.  In the drawing category I have many books and most of them espouse a rather common idea of drawing which involves making an overall shape, such as an oval, and then working to improve the shape into a face or feature into which the eyes, mouth et al are added.  In Ryder's book he starts out stressing that the artist should use a method that allows the overall production of the figure to proceed in distinct steps which stress the total development of the work rather than just one area at a time.  He wants the artist to try to use an \\"envelope\\" to start out with that embodies the entire figure including the gesture and the energy of the pose.<br /><br />This is a new idea - at least to me - and it is worth trying.  The author doesn't say it is the only way to draw but he does say it will improve your drawing to try this method and work at it consistently.  Of course it isn't for everyone.  There are many methods of drawing.  Contour is only one.  Mass is another.  This author uses what is basically a contour method and he adds in the mass (light and dark areas) after the contour is perfect.  It shows in his art.  Some will like it and some will not.  But that isn't the point.  The point is he has a method of producing lifelike figures that is different.<br /><br />Thus, I give the book 4 stars, because Mr. Ryder introduces this new idea in a straightforward fashion that allows the artist to try it out to see if it suits them.  The illustrations could be a little more complete but they are good enough to introduce the concept and by trial and error the student can see if it is something that works for them.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS! IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO PUT THIS OUT! IM PSYCHED! THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS OUT!!  Hey Zero get your facts straight before posting negative reviews. Other fans are eager to see this and your description of this version of the film is false. This directors cut has numerous differences from the theatrical version. Now that you know the scoop you can correct your review so it doesn't confuse anybody about what's on this DVD. Thanks!  This cut should be awesome!
0441003257|5.0|This is a wonderful example of the whole being better than the sum of its parts: while both authors are perfectly wonderful on their own (Gaiman is especially fantastic), together they were able to create something utterly unique ... and, honestly, now that I've read the novel at least a half-dozen times, I'm a little offended at the blurb on the cover that compares it to \\"The Hitchhikers Guide.\\"  I haven't yet read anything that came close to this book for pure, giddy, dark joy and moments of uncontrollable laughter. My partner has read the book almost as many times as I, and we still find the need to read some of the more brilliantly hilarious passages out loud to each other.  And I now never leave my tapes in the car for any longer than a week.  ;)
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Look, usually these S.E.'s are filled with a bunch of crap that you didn't care about in the first place.  What makes this worth buying is that it's actually a different verson of the movie.  There is 20 minutes of addtional footage!!  And there is footage that is cut out as well.  That means that roughly 1/4 of the movie will be different than the theatrical cut.  I liked the movie a lot but I think i will love the D.C.

B00007LTIL|5.0|This is the album that transformed me from a typical confused teenager of the 70s into a typical confused deadhead. Back then, we used to engage in seemingly endless debates about weighty topics, including \\"What is the best album (we called them albums back then) of all time?\\"  Many said Sgt Peppers, some said \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  Me, I beleived then, as I do now, that American Beauty is was the best album of its era. <br /> <br />Since those hazy days, I have come to appreciate this album for its inherent uniqueness.  It is a beautiful melding of folk, bluegrass and rock.  The band was at a turning point:  the mind bending days of the 60s had ended, and at least two of the members, Jerry and Phil are coping with the death (or impending death) of loved ones.  This album speaks of a yearning to return to something simpler and more basic.  It succeeds on every level.   <br /> <br />If you are wondering what the Dead thing is all about, and whether the band is as good as the hype, this is one of about a half dozen albums that should be on your must buy list. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I do think having Greedo shoot first was a terrible idea, but do the changes negate the whole? How many of you are not going to see Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong, because it's a remake? The original from 1933 will always be my favorite, but I am dying to see a modern remake making use of today's technology. <br />Besides, I'm not worried about the originals coming out on DVD. I have the \\"Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection\\" on laserdisc and I have burned them to DVD. (I'm not selling them if you're reading this Lucas, don't prosecute)It's 425 lines of resolution not 500, but you really can't tell the difference.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|I was sadly disappointed to hear Neil's opera cd, \\"Greendale\\", fall short of his potential. The songs on his new release sound tired, lack melody and are not very stirring. While the story about the Greens show Neil in a new direction with songs about an imagined family in Greendale, such as Double E that are listenable although the songs sound too identical to one another in their simplicity.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher John Francis Boone, the protagonist of this interesting and amazingly quick read, is a 15 year-old boy with autism.  Living in England with his father, he has a variety of quirks in regard to his daily routine, as well as a brilliant mind and capacity for mathematics.  One evening he finds that his neighbor's dog has been killed with a garden fork.  Despite his father's instructions otherwise, Christopher decides to find out how and why the dog was killed.  In his fearless and heartbreaking mission to learn the truth about the incident, Christopher ultimately learns a great deal about the secrets being kept from him within in his own family. Haddon's writing not only provides an insight into the workings of an autistic mind, but he reveals the hardship that a family can endure while raising a child with such a mental condition. <br /> I could not put this book down, and consequently read it entirely within the span of a day.  Haddon's writing style naturally pulls the reader in; developing an attachment to Christopher is inevitable.  This novel takes the idea of a murder mystery and uses it to create a much more cathartic reading experience.  For adults who have become jaded by all the complexities in life, it's quite refreshing to view the world in the simplistic terms of Christopher's mind.  His basic sense of logic and reasoning provides humor throughout the novel as well as some truly affecting moments.  It is remarkable that narration that is so matter-of-fact and numb can evoke such an emotional response.  I recommend The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime to any reader so that he or she may experience Haddon's incredible ability to write a touching page turner. <br />  <br />
B000001F2X|5.0|A perpetual complaint about J.J. Cale is that he always records the same record. I'm happy to report that the charge may be true. On a bright side, the end result is that Mr. Cale never recorded a bad album, that his songs are always soulful and beautiful and passionate no matter how simple or laidback they are. The emotional core of his music is what makes the songs/albums appear all alike, and this consistency makes him an artist unlike any other. Or, okey, like a very selected few. <br /> <br />The album in front of you, \\"5,\\" is perhaps one of his best. (And as many fans - that many personal favorites you'll find.) It certainly is high on my list, I'll admit it. It's pure J.J. magic: a mix bag of blues, country, soul, subdued funk, traces of early digital life (simple rhythm machines and echoes of synths, remember, this was 1979) and suggestions of what would later be defined as \\"americana,\\" - the mix that makes Mr. Cale's sound so unique.  <br /> <br />Never taking himself very seriously, J.J. created an opus as serene and colorful as life in the West is, mixing effortlessly bits of sadness and humor and earnestness and joy to paint mini pictures of life's simple pleasures (or troubles, depending on where you stand). Songs that make you smile at your own blues, justifying the feeling while making it a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br />What makes this album stand out in the whole opus is one track -\\"Sensitive Kind,\\" which I like to define as perhaps the only song ever to be presented in Cinemascope and old fashioned Technicolor. If you can imagine that. It's a simple love song that preaches better understanding and promotes patience in the everlasting battle of the sexes, but it is so touching it'll make your skin crawl. Strings and horns and mellow solo guitar and Rhodes piano... ah, pure beauty. And if the record is worth having, for anything - it's for this track. I'm not saying that the rest are bad - I love \\"Friday,\\" \\"Boilin' Pot,\\" \\"Mona,\\" \\"Don't Cry Sister,\\" toname just a few - it's just that \\"Sensitive Kind\\" is such a standout track, it towers over whole of Mr Cale's lifetime achievements. <br /> <br />And that pretty much makes this album the one to have. <br /> <br />A bit of a WARNING: although listed, the latest Universal pressing of this CD doesn't contain \\"Katy Kool Lady\\" and if that is the track you crave for, you may end up disappointed; instead, there is a mysterious track in it's place which is a bonus for hardcore fans but some could be upset if they want the exact replica of the original LP. (I'm lucky, I have the original vynil so I'm not complaining.)  <br /> <br />That also raises another question: why is Universal Music Group so cheap? I'm not even sure they properly remastered J.J.'s catalog they own, and the reprinted covers are so poorly designed  I'm thinking I'd do better job converting my vynils into digital tracks and just xeroxing the covers.  <br /> <br />Instead, why not expand the existing albums with outakes and/or some rare tracks - I'm sure there are some lying around, the one included here by mistake is a living proof - maybe add liner notes by a fan or Cale's opus connoisseur, or even some of the musicians who admire him so much, why not make it worthy of such a great talent that Mr. Cale is? <br /> <br />Unless that happens soon, stick to this edition, you will not regret a single note of the music here.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Give me the original trilogy as I saw them when I was a kid Mr. Lucas.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this DVD set because it said it was the complete show and i was tired of having to buy season after season, spending a lot of money in the process.  Well now i wish there was another season to buy of this show, because it's awesome.  Somehow it weaves the genres of western and science fiction to create the most compelling story line i have seen on television.  I wish I heard of this show earlier, maybe while it was actually on television.  Fox brought back The Family Guy after it did well from DVD sales and also viewership on The Cartoon Network, perhaps if sales of Firefly do well and it gets syndication on some cable network, such as The SciFi channel, then it too can be brought back on some network.
B000002MUN|4.0|I personally enjoyed this album more than any of the other Petty albums, to include any of his Greatest Hits packages.  Perhaps it is because it is one of his more modern releases, as opposed to his work in the 70's.  For those who compare Petty to George Harrison or Bob Dylan, I would say that Petty is in good company.<br /><br />I actually find that songs from this disc are played more often on the radio than some of Petty's other work, and the radio-friendly feel is obvious, as you find yourself singing along to all of the songs on this disc.<br /><br />Like Van Halen's first CD, nearly all of the tracks on this disc are worthy of being \\"singles\\", which is not a bad thing, as most artists try to sell a CD on the strength of one or two singles, so when you have an album full of them, and no filler, that's the mark of a good album.<br /><br />Petty doesn't have the greatest voice in the world, nor the greatest range, but he doesn't need it for the material he writes.<br /><br />My personal favorite Tom Petty album.  I first picked it up in the late 90's as soon as I returned from military deployment, and have loved it ever since.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|Context:  Big AP fan going back to 1976.  Bottom line:  Interesting effort but with only 9 songs (including 2 remakes), not enough music to consider an above average AP disc.  The remakes are quite good.  The rest of the music different enough to make it listenable.  If you are an AP fan, get it.  If not, wait for the used discs to show up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There are some changes I like and there are some I don't.   But overall I still enjoy the \\"updated\\" Star Wars Trilogy and it is still lightyears ahead of most of the stuff that Hollywood has dished out so far.  And to finally have it with DVD quality picture and sound is wonderful!!!   <br /> <br />If Leonardo Da Vinci or Shakespeare or Madonna wants to go back and \\"rework\\" THEIR OWN WORK it is their right.  If you don't like it for whatever reason too bad.  Don't buy it.  Or make your own movie.  If it was someone other than the original creator that would be another story.  George Lucas is the rightful owner of the these works and always will be.  George Lucas doesn't \\"owe\\" his fans anything.  He's the one that worked hard on these projects and pulled it out of his imagination. The only \\"right\\" the consumer has over these works is that VHS, laserdisc, or DVD copy of these films that he/she bought. <br /> <br />Anyways, thank you George Lucas for finally briging your fantastic creation on DVD sooner than we hoped for.
B0002MPU1K|1.0|This cd is very disappointing. The instrumentation is wonderful but Peter sings too much and his vocal range is lacking.  Buy the self titled Cincotti cd, which is wonderful, and pass this one over.
0316666343|3.0|There are many different aspects of this book that had me both intrigued and then not- so. The plot of the book was excellent. Not having a set idea of what heaven is or what I truly believe for a religion I was quite curious of how someone else viewed it. I agree with some that the ending did seem rather hurried and not well thought out, which disappointed me to know end. I don't think that anyone would use there last minutes on earth having sex with a middle school crush. What I did like about the book however was how the family coped with the loss of Susie. For the most part this stood true. But it was too unbelievable how anyone could, out of absolutley nowhere, suddenly suspect the killer when there was nothing that indicated this was even an option. Over all though I was rather fond of this book. It wasn't meant to be a suspensful murder-mystery, or a detective type novel it's simply a fiction novel for all ages to read, this book was meant to entertain, and it did just that. This book had me reading until it was finished, I thought the author used her imagination and wrote the book splendidly.
0140187537|5.0|This underrated book presents the classic moral dilemma which pits the desire of the main character to live a moral, simple and decent life against the pressures from outside influences to obtain material wealth and standing through means which would cause him to give up the morals he holds most precious to him.  This is the type of novel that all people should read after they have entered the workforce and can reflect on their own lives.  Steinbeck leads the reader through the main character's thoughts and finishes this personal journey with an ending which will have readers turning back the pages to see the events which preceded the conclusion.  I read the last chapters several times and each time was moved.<br /><br />The reason why this novel is underrated is that while it lacks the size and power of some of Steinbeck's other novels, such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\", I often reflect upon the lessons of this novel years later in my own life. For this reason, it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's novels.  Like all of Steinbeck's writings, it acccomplishes its goals with a concise economic prose, which serves to emphasize the message of the novel.  It is a novel of significant moral effect and it should be read several times during a lifetime to remind us of the difference between right and wrong and the significance that our actions may have on the lives of those around us and on ourselves.
B00005JMAH|1.0|I have read many people complaining about how bad the movie was because of the left out parts from the book.  I understand this disappointment but it is a movie and most times they cannot put everything into the movie that is in the book.  The thing I hated most was the look of the movie.  The first two movies were magical.  Every scene was beautiful.  Take the Dining Hall for example.  In the first two movies, it was majestic.  The tables were beautiful, and the area where the professors sat were beautiful.  But in this third one, most of the sets looked like they were bought from the sets of some low class B-movie.  Hagrids house looked like a shack and was trashy.  When i think of the Harry Potter World i think of magic and adventure.  I do not think about going to the movies and watching another Beverly Hillbillies movie.  That is what this movie reminded me of.  The scenes with harry flying on the hippogriff were really well done and so were the dementors, but the rest of the movie looked like there wasn't enough money left to make the movie truly spectacular.  I hope the new Director for the fourth movie will see this as well and bring us back to the magic that made the first two movies loved throughout the world.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am getting really sick of people calling Moores films propaganda! Do you people even know what the word \\"propaganda\\" even means, well here is the definition given by Websters Dictionary, \\"False information or ideas methodically spread to promote or injure a cause, group, or nation.\\" Now nothing that Moore has said in any of his films is false information! How can something be propaganda when it comes from the sources mouth? One reviewer commented on Bush commenting on the terrorists and then saying \\"watch this drive\\" without missing a beat by saying, \\"cant he golf and not be bothered?\\". NO he cant! He is the president, he should have not commented on his golf swing at all, he should have sayed what he sayed about the terrorists then went on his way. By saying what he sayed the way he said it, it makes him look like he doesn't care and his golfing is more important. Michael Moore is not anti-american, he just wants a better America! One reviewer commented about the woman who lost her son in the war by saying that her son signed on to the military voluntarily. Yes it is true that he did sign on of his own free will, but once you are in the military OWNS you and you do what they say. She was protesting Bush for carelessly sending people to die for an unjust war! He signed up for the military, but not to die for no reason.<br /><br />Michael Moore is a truth seeker not a propagandist, sometimes the truth hurts. If you want to be a drone and just do and beleive everything that Bush says, then you are a fool. I do not hate our country, in fact I love it, but it has many problems, and I commend Moore for having the guts to point these problems out! I can argue every point Moore has made, and welcome anyone to discuss then at any time.
0064407667|5.0|My younger son, now almost 10, and I discovered this series of books about a year ago.  We gobbled up every word in every book and couldn't get enough!  The sharp whit and dark humour in these books is refreshing and appropriate for all ages (including adults!).  The eleventh book, \\"The Grim Grotto\\", comes out tomorrow, and I will be at the bookstore first thing in the morning to grab my copy!
B00005JNEI|1.0|You know going in to this that there would be a ton of reviews, but I thought that more than one would be a critique of the movie.  Granted I only read the first twenty or so reviews but you people have to go to a chat room to get out your political gripes.  I realize that I'm griping here but you would expect to see more than one out of twenty that give you an idea about the movie.  Even the damn Amazon review was bias.   <br />Bad reviews= \\"Bush is great and Micheal Moore is fat.\\"  Wow, that tells me a lot about the movie. <br />Good reviews= \\"Everyone should see this because Bush is bad for or country.\\"  Again, thanks for all the help. <br />Amazon review= \\"Micheal Moore shows how under Bush things are worse.\\"  Gotta hand it Amazon for that beauty.   <br />Don't you people realize that you are whats wrong.  Yes that's the entire thought.  YOU ARE WHAT'S WRONG.
B000000I3O|5.0|The Misfits put goth influenced punk on the map. every song on here is a classic. If you're a music fan you should get this record. Glenn Danzig has to be one of the best vocalist in history even though he does tend to sound like a punk/goth Jim Morisson who was himself a great vocalist,The Lizard King right?Anyway th best song is Skulls with all the other songs coming at a close second.
B00003CXCT|5.0|If Lucas was just not so stubburn...oh well.  Anyway, other than the new Han/Greedo scene, the TERRIBLE song/dance thing in Jabbas palace, and hayden  christianson being in ROTJ, the SE DVDs is Spectacular!! Great sound and picture quality!!  They even brushed up the awful jabba scene in ANH!
B00003CXCT|2.0|In a moment of weakness I pre-ordered the Special Edition DVD. I really hate paying money for a version of these films I don't care for, but am pretty sure the originals WON'T be offered on DVD anytime soon, if ever. <br /> <br />I saw the Special Edition movies when they were re-released in theaters before the horrible Episode I and was under-whelmed by them. The new CGI scenes only diminished the movies I had loved as a kid.  <br /> <br />Obviously, Lucas cares little about the moviegoers who obsessed over the original films and gave him the bucks to create his 'empire'. Would it be such a tremendous faux pas to at least offer 'A New Hope' in its original form? Sure, clean up the picture and tweak the sound, but give people the chance to re-experience, scene-by-scene, what they were so wowed by in '77.  <br /> <br />Given that these DVD's are #1 here on Amazon, I doubt Lucas cares about some upset fans who will end up purchasing the Special Edition anyways. Still, it would be interesting to see if an Original Edition would out-sell the CGI enhanced bastardizations. I certainly believe they would. <br /> <br />One more thing, the bonus disc with the two-hour 'Empire of Dreams' documentary; it just aired on A&E last week! What gives? Four hours of 'special features' now becomes only two hours because I've already seen half of it for free on a cable TV channel!  <br /> <br />Lucas is a man out of touch with what attracted people to his original movies. His last two films are proof of this. Lightning, it would appear, does not strike twice.    <br /> <br />
1401301010|5.0|This book is an awesome, can't put it down, laugh outloud, bring you to tears, insightful and thought provoking book.  It is one you will want to read and re-read.  Anthony Kiedis is so eloquent even when telling you about all the juvenil mayhem he conducted.  I learned so much about him, his life, and the band.  He tells a story that corrects some of the information that has been published about him and the band.  There are also awesome pictures of Anthony and his family and friends with his descriptions, dates, etc.  You will definately want to buy this book and keep it for a lifetime!
B00009XITP|4.0|Yes, this film is a little 'fluffy', but what's wrong with fluff at times?  Fluff can be fun, and this film is most definitely fun.  I rented this to help round out my personal 'Colin Firth Film Festival', and I wasn't disappointed.  (Colin, paternal sentiments, leather pants and a motorcycle. 'Nuff said.) <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised by Amanda Bynes as well.  I'm well past the Nickolodeon demographic, so I hadn't seen more than a few short clips of her work, and those reveal some talent, and a great feel for comedy.  But she does reasonably well with the emotive parts of the film.  As the director's commentary says, there's a lot of acting done in this film with expression, not just dialogue, and Amanda does just fine in this regard. <br /> <br />Something that wasn't mentioned in either commentary, suprisingly, were what I saw, at least, as a couple of subtle nods to Colin Firth's past work (A&E's Pride & Prejudice).  His character's fiancee is played by the wonderful Anna Chancellor, who of course played Miss Caroline Bingley (the rival for his affections) in P&P.  In the scene where Henry is showing off the family portraits to Daphne, he introduces one of them as \\"Bingley Dashwood\\".  I love little winks like that.  <br /> <br />The best scene though (for those of us in it for eye candy of the Colin persuasion) is, of course, when he tugs on those tight black leather pants and...well, you've just got to see it. :) <br /> <br />
B00008K7AM|4.0|My wife and I are big Rob Schneider fans however, after seeing the trailer (which usually highlights the best of the movie) and reading the reviews, we felt that this movie didn't even deserve a rental. Then, Starz showed it on a free preview weekend. Feeling we had nothing to lose we watched it. Yes, it was very predictable and had plently of bathroom humor but the bottom line is, it was very entertaining. Its been a long time since my wife and I watched a movie together where we both laugh ourselves into tears.
B00000JLWW|5.0|There are few movies that in my opinion rival the emotional power of 1997's epic \\"Titanic\\" which is still one of the greatest movies ever made to this very day.<br /><br /> In 1997 when a team of ocean divers send down a couple of deep-sea probes to scour the ocean floor, they recover a safe where they uncover a set of drawings of a young woman named Rose that was drawn back on April 14, 1912 but then they receive a call from a centenarian named Rose Dawson Calvert and she tells them that the drawing of the woman was herself done 84 years ago (At the time of the movie) Set on April 14, 1912 on the Titanic's maiden (and only) voyage, it is the tale of two young lovers one is an extremely wealthy young woman named Rose Bukater and a poor lower class young man named Jack Dawson.<br /><br /> There are few movies that in my opinion rival the emotional impact that titanic had on me back when it was released in movie theatres on that cold December day in 1997. The sets on this movie are among the greatest I've ever seen. The titanic scenes, most of them at least, were in fact shot on a real replica of the ship.<br /><br /> This movie could really have turned out to be another \\"Heaven's Gate\\" as feared, a movie that cost huge amounts to make and ultimately flopped, but instead and deservedly so \\"Titanic\\" ultimately went on to become the most successful box-office film in history with over 1.8 Billion dollars made from it's release and when it was retired from theatres. It's not hard to see why it was so. \\"Titanic\\" is arguably one of the greatest masterpieces ever made and only James Cameron's extremely powerful directing could've made it such a powerful, riveting, and emotional experience.<br /><br /> Cameron is one of my all time favorite directors and his movies are among the greatest I've ever seen but I've got to give my hats off as \\"Titanic\\" is without a doubt his greatest achievement of all time and I highly recommend this today!
B00005JN7O|2.0|Fine throwback to the serial movies of the 40's that is fine for what it is but lacks a script and a story to capture the feel of that era. Jude Law and Company are fine but they are the only things in this entire film that look real. The rest of the film looks a little too fake to be taken seriously and the CGI is a little too much for it's own sake.  <br /> <br />A good film to watch if nothing is on but not worth the ticket to see.  <br />
B00003TL18|5.0|This DVD is an absolute must have. For the poor unfortunates who were unlucky to never see Roy perform, well buy this DVD it's all you could want and more!! My children were absolutely enthralled as to how he could hit perfect note after perfect note with such apparent ease. Nice to see The Boss there and Elvis Costello too, shame KD Lang was only backing but hey who's grumbling. This is absolutely brilliant I'd give more stars if I could
B0002EXH4K|2.0|I dig \\"The System has Failed\\" so much that I've been in a real Megadeth mood lately...so today I wanted to listen to \\"Countdown...\\", but I couldn't find my original. \\"Hey\\", I thought, \\"I'll just check out the re-master\\". I kinda wish I hadn't. It just sounds weak...\\"Symphony\\" sounds gross and thin, with the vocals sounding strange and the drums too up front.  I've only gotten through half the album...I thought the demos were interesting though-the \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" demo being a much different version than that which ended up on the album.<br /><br />  Lately I've just been realizing that \\"re-master\\" does not necessarily equal \\"real good\\". Purchase if you're curious, but do yourself a favor and hang on to the original-it really is a totally different experience...<br /><br />  ...we all know metal sounds best on cassette anyway.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Return to Oz was something I purchased without knowing anything about it. However, I have been an Oz collector for a decade, and if there's anything I've learned, it's to keep an open mind to things like this.  <br /> <br />Return to Oz was a pleasent surprise! But I warn you, it's not the Oz you saw in the Judy Garland musical. There are no cute dance numbers, and the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are not men in costumes.  <br /> <br />Return to Oz received mixed reviews. Fans of the 1939 classic were offended by its darkness, as if to say, \\"How dare you show reality in Oz.\\" But what the avid fans of the movie often miss are the BOOKS!!! Return to Oz was never meant to be a sequel to the movie, but to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. It was based on the second and third books of the series. <br /> <br />Return to Oz was very bold, and used all the newest technology of the time. Who else but Disney would be brave enough to touch a classic that was put on a pedestal by Judy Garland fans? Well folks, believe it or not, some people are so closed minded that they thought anything that had \\"Oz\\" in it would be fluffy. READ THE BOOKS! Not everything is fluff n' puff. <br /> <br />So don't be shocked when Dorothy is sent to a mental institution, or when you see that the little girl who plays her is not 16 years old. That's right, Dorothy is the age she was originally intended to be: 9. Also don't be shocked that the characters you knew from the first are barely in it.  <br /> <br />In the movie, Oz has been overthrown by the evil Gnome King in Dorothy's absence, and all the people of the Emerald City have been turned to stone. So Dorothy comes back to a broken Oz...DON'T BE SHOCKED! Or at least, if you're shocked, keep an open mind because it gets better. <br /> <br />The rest of the film is Dorothy's quest to rescue the Scarecrow, who the Gnome King keeps in his palace as bate for Dorothy. She goes to rescue him of course, and after many grim adventures and after finding some enchanting new friends, everything ends happily ever after.  <br /> <br />The acting and music were superb, and if you're an Oz fan you'll love it. It's a bit much for the kids (it has sometimes been classified as a horror movie) but most kids can handle it.  <br /> <br />It's worth ever cent! I hope you buy it, because you will enjoy it! <br /> <br />God bless!
0060090383|5.0|Far and away the best of the Brit-Chic-Lit genre. I loved Watermelon, and almost all of Marian Keyes' novels, but Rachel's Holiday is the best. I've read them all--Marian, Helen, Sophie, Anna, Lisa, Wendy, Jane, etc... and after a while many of the characters--and most of the plots--start to run together. Not Rachel--or any of her sisters for that matter. Fantastic book!
B00004U2G4|4.0|Guitar virtuoso Jeff Beck's first offering after he left Yardbirds was one of the most important albums to many rock lovers. Many see this album as the blueprint of Led Zeppelin's starting years as there are lots of similarities between Truth & Led Zeppelin's debut album. Offcourse it has a few notable connection with Led Zeppelin. Jimi Page was Jeff Beck's friend and also an ex-Yardbird. John Paul Jones played organ in one its track. Another star performer to appear for one track was Keith Moon with the name \\"You know who\\"...Funny? <br /> <br />What the album offers...it is a pure blue-rocking album with lots of blues presented with Beck's raging guitar, the starting and ending of \\"You shook me\\" is inspiring to say the least...may be he was trying to do some Jimi Hendrix. Ron Wood & Rod Stewart were also in the line up at that point of time. Rod's vocal were not at its fullest at that point of time, he was in a strange situation as producers wanted Beck to sing the songs instead of then lesser known Stewart. Beck even recorded a single as vocalist before release of this album. After Truth & Beck-Ola the band broke up as Stewart & Wood left to form The faces. <br /> <br />Lets go through a few of the songs... <br />\\"Shapes of Things\\" is a Yardbirds tune done differently with a little unstable vocals from Rod.  <br />\\"Let Me Love You\\" is solid blues number.   <br />\\"Morning Dew\\" good pipes at the beginning & end of this track (requested by Rod as he likes scottish pipes)   <br />\\"You Shook Me\\" blues classic also done by Led Zep...  <br />\\"Blues Deluxe\\" - epic from the album.      <br /> <br />Overall it was a great first time effort by Beck & his band but according to me it just misses the top rating...
B000002J03|5.0|I think this is Zeppelin's greatest album. I can qualify this by saying perhaps that this is their best early album. I like this as a very interesting and successful transformation of their original blues ideas into new territory. Page packs in some absolutely classic riffs that are now standards. Curiously two of the tracks are either too long or too dull to me - \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" - a classic riff for sure - but that is about it. However it is testament to how a great band like Zeppelin can spin out a two chord song for so long, and \\"Moby Dick\\" with a great riff but interminably long and boring drum solo (aren't most drum solos dull?). Otherwise this is just superb varied material and with wonderful playing and singing from all involved. My favorites are \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"Thank you\\" and \\"Bring it on home\\". I also really like \\"Living Loving Maid\\" although clearly the band didn't much as they never played it live. I think it is a testament to the greatness of this album that despite having lukewarm feelings towards two of the tracks I think this is a great album.
B00005QEO1|5.0|...at its best. Let me try to sum this album up in one line. \\"Driving speedy blues based hard rock with great vocals, guitars, drums with strains of funk & traces of harmonica\\"...yeah that's the what I can think of. This is the first complete album I listened by them, I have listened atleast something by most of the 70's (my favorite decade in music) bands, but Aerosmith were an exception untill 17th September, 2004. I can't explain why I ignored them for so long but I am very happy that at last I tried something by them. Before that I listened a few hits by them here & there and I liked most of them specially 'Love in an elevator', 'Falling in love', 'I Don't wanna miss a thing'. <br /> <br />Greatness starts right from the first track \\"Young last\\" and ends with \\"What it takes\\" and having only one weak track bluesy \\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\\" this album is a treat for all the fans of hard rock. They execute the album in their style. 4 of the tracks have been divided into two parts...a shorter first part & a great second part. The tracks as usual contains Aerosmith's dirty (I would say naughty) lyrics and enough punches to keep you rocking till you drop. <br /> <br />Best track from the album are \\"Going Down/Love in an Elevator\\", \\"Dulcimer Stomp/The Other Side\\", \\"Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man\\", \\"Young last\\"...there are other 5 tracks which are also not particularly weak. Very rightly this is called Bigboy's comeback album although somebody may want to give that award to \\"Permanent vacation\\". <br /> <br />Anybody interested in Aerosmith should get this. This is not very raw, infact it is much polished than I expected it to be. Let me assure you that the chances are quite bright that you will like it, although you can get the other classics like \\"Rocks\\" and \\"Toys in the attic\\". I will be getting those soon. 5 stars.
B0002B15XI|4.0|The passage of time has had interesting effects on the legacy of Robert Altman's 1970 war satire. On the one hand, you could point to \\"M*A*S*H\\" as an irreverent black comedy with serious political/social undertones; culmination of a sub-genre launched in the 1960s with Stanley Kubrick's pointedly satirical \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", and continuing with the more abstract European anti-war films \\"King Of Hearts\\" and \\"How I Won The War\\". On the other hand, you could also say that \\"M*A*S*H\\", with its generous helping of bawdy frat-boy sex pranks and expletive-rich insult humor (something American audiences hadn't seen much in major studio releases up to that point in time) also could have helped pave the way for the likes of \\"Porky's\\", \\"Caddyshack\\" and the \\"American Pie\\" franchise, i.e. the general \\"dumbing down\\" of Hollywood. (I have to chuckle at some of the younger reviewers making comments to the effect of: \\"This movie is weird and boring-its not ANYTHING like the TV show...\\" I rest my case.) \\"M*A*S*H\\" is the first truly \\"Altmanesque\\" film that Altman made- a huge cast, overlapping (and frequently improvised) dialogue, busy set pieces and a patented mix of high and low comedy. Also notable for launching the careers of Bud Cort, Tom Skeritt, Sally Kellerman, Michael Murphy, and at least a half dozen more actors whose names are credited with the phrase \\"And introducing...\\" The single-disc 2004 DVD version released by Fox features a sparkling widescreen transfer, decent sound and director commentary. Altman's commentary track is sporadic but worthwhile for film buffs. Along with \\"Nashville\\" and \\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\\", this is \\"must-see\\" Altman.
6304806418|2.0|Boy was I ever disappointed with Evita.  The songs are terrible (except for \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" and \\"You Must Love Me\\"), so overly worded, and they do nothing to advance what little story there is.  I'm still dumbfounded as to what exactly Eva Peron did for her country.  From what I could gather from Madonna's close to home performance, was sleep her way to the top.  (I fail to understand why the people of Argentina didn't like the choice of Madonna as their favorite first lady...she seems to fit the role perfectly).  The one pleasant surprise of the movie was how wonderful Antonio Banderas was.  I never knew he could sing as good as he looks!  Give him his own musical.  Don't make him play second fiddle to the you know what.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Mystic River was one of the best dramatic, suspense thrillers that I've seen in a long time.  I didn't get a chance to catch it at the theatre but after I found out how many oscars this film was nominated for along with a star studded cast (Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Laurence Fishburn) I went out and purchased the DVD and boy, was it worth every dollar. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end of the movie.  Two Thumbs up for Mr. Clint Eastwood!

0517123207|5.0|In this wonderfully readable text Darwin introduces the ideas that have changed biology.  <br />The two strongest points of the book are: its readability, which it really is, it's arguments against repeated creationism, which are among the best and clearest I have read.  <br />The structure of the arguments for his theory which slowly unfolds for the eyes of the reader makes for a convincing and readable story. Of course the book being 150 years old there are some shortcomings, especially focussed around Darwin's lack of knowledge of the mechanisms invoklved in inheritance (genes). Quoting and treating of scientific references might also appear oldfashioned.  <br />In spite of thse shortcomings the impact of this book has been so immense that I would advice everyone to read it, that is why it got the 5 stars as well. Without reading it neither supporters nor opponents of his theories can fairly debate about its implicaitons

B000002AEN|5.0|John Smith Hurt of Avalon, Mississippi wasn't really a bluesman. Sure, he had numerous blues tunes in his exceptionally broad repertoire, but he never regarded himself as a blues singer. His playing was just too refined and articulate, and his gentle voice too plain to work in a mass setting such as a dance; John Hurt's music was (and is) best heard in small, intimate gatherings.     Rediscovered in 1963 after 35 years of musical inactivity, John Hurt didn't even own a guitar when Tom Hoskins travelled to Mississippi to establish whether he was still among the living. He was, and he became the darling of the mid-60s folk crowd, but way back in 1928, when Hurt was in his mid-30s, he laid down these thirteen sides for OKeh, and they remain his ultimate musical statement.   These are the highly priced collector's items that initially made Hurt's rediscovery and idea worth pursuing...sheer musical perfection, with a keen sense of chord melody structure which makes John Hurt's bouncy, rhythmic playing sound both elegant and driving, topped as it is by his warm, pleasant voice.     He mixes spirituals, blues, and folk songs, coming off as a songster rather than a bluesman most of the time, and his versions of religious pieces like \\"Praying On The Old Camp Ground\\" and \\"Blessed Be The Name\\" are just beautiful.  These are the original incarnations of \\"Candy Man Blues\\", \\"Avalon Blues\\", \\"Nobody's Dirty Business\\", and Hurt's renditions of \\"Stack O'Lee\\", \\"Spike Driver Blues\\", and \\"Frankie\\". He went on to re-record almost all of these songs in the 60s, but these are the originals, and the ones on which his highly justifiable reputation rests. And the sound quality is truly amazing...would that we could one day hear Charlie Patton or Blind Lemon Jefferson or Son House's 1930 waxings this clearly.

B00005JKN9|1.0|This film omits a crucuial portion of the history of the 1863 draft riots.  The riots largely targeted African Americans and included both the destruction of their property and the lynching and killing of African Americans.  A number of children were killed when a building where Afircan Americans lived was torched.  In an attempt to make the characters look sympathetic, the film ignores disgusting actions taken against a powerless minority. <br /> <br />As an aside, this is not being PC.  All histories of the draft riots include these accounts, including those of conservative historians.
0679735909|4.0|A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION is an intellectual's book.  Its most tangible passion is for the acquisition of knowledge rather than for the depths of the love stories it contains.  Roland Mitchell, a young and floundering scholar, uncovers two unsent letters written by the Victorian poet he is studying, Randolph Henry Ash.  Instead of declaring them to the staff of the London Library, he slips them undetected into his belongings - and sets in motion a literary detective story.  The letters suggest that Ash may not have been entirely faithful to his wife, and Roland's attempts to uncover the identity of the woman lead him to Maud Bailey, a feminist scholar and a descendent of, and expert on, the poet Christabel LaMotte, the probable woman in question.  As the two scholars work together to uncover the truth of the relationship through letters, journals, poetry, and retracing the movements of their respective poets, they find themselves unwilling to share their discoveries with the outside world.  As other, more powerful academics are alerted to their suspicious research, the two become even more insular, to the detriment of personal relationships and careers.  Everyone, it seems, wants sole possession of the information they have since it threatens to challenge everything previously written about the two poets.<br /><br />The \\"Romance\\" part of the title is misleading, for Byatt uses the term in the Victorian, and not the Harlequin, sense.  Yes, the romance between Ash and LaMotte is uncovered, and yes, something simmers between Roland and Maud, but the overriding story involves intellectual sparring and academic adventure.  If you do not like formal poetry, don't even bother opening this book, as Byatt fills it with lengthy, Victorian-style poems that she expects the reader to interpret as artistic proof of the poets' relationship.  Large sections of the book are also filled with the correspondence between Ash and LaMotte, the intentionally bland journal of Ash's wife Ellen, the journal of LaMotte's live-in lover, and excerpts from a biography written by the archrival of Roland's advisor.  While the piecing together of this evidence is both ambitious and clever, the result is a diluted narrative drive.  Passion - and possessiveness - is never as strong when described to another as it is in action, and Byatt's approach leaves little room for lively interaction.  Instead, she relies on the reader's intellectual curiosity, hoping he cares about the fate of literary legacies as much as she does.  The strongest, most vivid passages are written in the more traditional storytelling technique of limited third-person, allowing the reader to see through the eyes of various characters, most notably, near the end, of Ellen Ash, who finally comes alive.  The closing pages, also written this way, are powerfully realized.<br /><br />I can understand why many readers cannot finish this novel, as the formal and often ornate prose feels cold even with Byatt's keen eye; however, readers who like their fiction on an intellectual plane will find much to admire.  I recommend this novel only for serious, and tenacious, readers who enjoy both prose and poetry and who are willing to forgo emotion for the sake of intellectual satisfaction.en, the journal of LaMotte's live-in lover, and excerpts from a biography written by the archrival of Roland's advisor.

0679746048|5.0|This slim memoir of a college student who suffers a \\"breakdown\\" honestly explores the details of mental illness, specifically \\"borderline personality\\" disorders.  The account starts in a cold, almost frightening way:  the first page is a copy of author Kaysen's case record folder.  The reader then is given a fleeting description of the quiet moments leading up to Kaysen's lengthy hospitalization, and then is shown more official documents.  This juxtaposition of the clinical with the personal highlights exactly what this memoir aims to express, that the darkness of mental disease has a face, a voice, that can be hidden by labels and diagnoses.<br /><br />Kaysen's difficult and often terrifying journey  - from the ordinary daughter of two achieving parents to a patient at a psychiatric hospital to, tentatively, a recovered young woman - is at once moving and beautiful.  Even when the author asks questions that many before her have asked, she makes them seem fresh: \\"What is it about meter and cadence and rhythm that makes their makers mad?\\"  She explores her illness at its most intimate moments and often follows her breaks with reality with detached physician reports, giving the reader both inside and outside perspectives.  Through her interactions with other patients, Kaysen makes it clear that not everyone is as fortunate as she, since some cannot extricate themselves from their illness.  Interestingly, despite once not believing that she really had bones inside her, Kaysen is not convinced she was mentally ill; if nothing else, this questions the internal changes we've been taught to accept as part of the onset of mental illness.<br /><br />This book should not be read by anyone believing she is slipping toward insanity, but it might be a comfort to those who have already emerged.  Kaysen is at once ordinary and gifted despite this turbulent part of her life.  More importantly, this book should be read by the loved ones of those in distress, for it gives a human dimension to what is often ostracized.  Understanding the thought processes of at least one stricken young women goes a long way to having compassion for and understanding others.is often ostracized.

B00028HBKC|1.0|I think the real message here is how a great marketing plan can turn a Mel-indulgent, suffering-fest into a blockbuster. Congratulations on your marketing Mel, but boo to your vision. Most of the people in the film are caricatures, devoid of one iota of consciense.  <br /> <br />WWJD? I think he would have walked out of the theatre into the sunlight. Jesus had a simple message. Too bad we continue to Muck it up.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Sometimes you want to just sit and see a movie, just for fun.<br /><br />This is how I viewed, \\"The Hot Chick.\\"  This movie revolves around the story of body switching, yes between a teenage girl and a man definitely below her standards. The teenage girl in this story has everything, hates everyone except herself and really was in a need of an attitude adjustment.  She certainly received it in this story.<br /><br />  Walking up, after having a curse put on her through an ancient pair of earrings, she is now in the body of a man. I giggled through this movie because I was not expecting anything more than that. The acting was good, the storyline lively, and yes it was silly, but sometimes silly is what we all need in a world that if filled with so many trials. Thanks for the smiles!
B000069AUI|5.0|As mentioned in the title, these guys wish they were like their more noteworthy homeland heroes radiohead, and even though they fall short of radiohead's genius, trying is a very ambiguous and commendable endeavor. To put it simply, a Rush of Blood to the Head is melodically adept. Every song has a beautiful flowing melody, complimented by Chris Martin's soothing, yet pleading vocal stylings. The lyrics are straightforward and not incredibly impressive, but the vocal melodies are pristine, which is all that really matters. This album is definitely an investment that won't be regretted, and should tide you over until the next radiohead album comes out which won't be out for another year or so... this, however, will more than likely be coldplay's last album according to Chris Martin. tsk tsk tsk.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|My sister made a CD with a Gavin DeGraw song on it and I don't buy CD's for one measly song, no matter how good it is. . . but I took a risk and bought this album and I fell positively head over heels in love with it.  It's so rare nowadays to find an album where each song is listenable, let alone incredibly written and vocally delivered.  I neglected to listen to the live versions until recently; big mistake!!  There were songs on the original album that I thought were decent that really came to life acoustically.  Just Friends happens to be the prime example.  Gavin adds flavor to each live song that the mass-produced pop crap the radio airs wouldn't usually allow, for whatever stupid reason.  Gavin DeGraw is the Stevie Wonder of today; absolutely amazing!  I drove across the state of Massachusetts and back the long way listening only to this album, belting it out w/ Mr. DeGraw the whole way.  You could probably hear me in California. . . and I NEVER sing.  It's that good.  Personal favorites: Follow Through, Just Friends (acoustic), and More Than Anyone.  If you buy any album this year or in your lifetime, get Chariot (Stripped)!!
B00005JN7O|2.0|As in Cold Mountain, Jude Law's lack of chemistry with his leading ladies let the air out of this movie. Combined with a weak plot it left the film slide along as a chain of stunning set pieces without  emotional involvement.   Jolie's short bit showed how the challenge could have been met, I wish she had played the lead.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I had heard of Damien, and then my roommate made me listen to Eskimo and I was absolutely blown away by his incorporation of opera into folk music or whatever you call this.  It needs no classification; it's just plain good!  This is an album you can listen to over and over and over again.  These are songs to fall in love to.  I personally have made out to Cannonball on repeat for hours at a time.  No joke.  Damien Rice brings to the table a sense of originality that every music artist in every genre should want to have.  And I absolutely love the infusion of Irish folk music into the melodies.  LOVED every song on the album but 1.  Buy it for sure!!
0451191153|5.0|I received this book as a present from a family member. With the little time that I have to spare I kept it on my bookcase unopened for half a year. As soon as I started reading The Fountainhead I was hooked. As an architecture student I can relate to the architecture themes and the characters presented in the novel. Not only could I relate to the characters, but I was enveloped on the personalities of the characters and the outcome of their actions. Ayn Rands descriptive way of writing is so specific that one can easily make a picture of the buildings and projects described. As I read all I thought about was flying to New York to see the buildings that were described, then I would realize that they aren't real and I think that such buildings should.  <br /> I sincerely recommend this book to people who are interested in architecture. I know that architecture is very time consuming, but if you can spare a few minutes a day to read this book, you should. <br />
B000002MY3|5.0|I remember exactly where I was the first time I heard \\"you oughta know\\" and mind you, I only caught the tail end of it; and I HAD to know who the artist was.  Ohhh Alanis.  I forgot how much I loved you and Jagged Little Pill until Saturday when I accidentally saw Alanis again in concert at Mixfest.  Forget India and Providence and whatever else the hell she says in \\"thank you,\\" she should've tipped her hat to Glenn Ballard for producing JLP. Hello, man in the mirror!!  Not only did she create the movement for angry female rockers, she demonstrated her musical diversity; no one song is quite like any other on the album and she does have a softer side.  Although Alanis proved to be mainstream popular, she's a far cry from and quite superior to the meaningless lyricism that shrouds pop today and then. A two-toed sloth could write that crap.  Alanis speaks to hear audience in a way that everyone can relate.  This album is one that will change your life if it didn't already.
B000067J1H|3.0|If you have ever felt anesthetized by modern life, bored with the world of 9 to 5 and sitcoms on the way to yawning yourself to sleep, or pondered if you could have ever become the stereotyped \\"loner who becomes a serial killer\\" if your life had turned out differently, \\"Fight Club\\" has some surprising things to say to you. <br /> <br />This film was very badly promoted upon its 1999 release, showing only its title aspect, wherein young men meet in private to pummel one another into oblivion.  The surprise as a first-time viewer, years later, is that this is only the middle third of the story, a turning point for an anchorless character who apparently has no family or friends and isn't fond of his job, almost literally sleepwalking his way through a life devoted to filling his empty world with marginally interesting stuff and looking for something that might make him feel alive. <br /> <br />The insomniac narrator of the film falls into a rather different circle of friends when his condo is blown to smithereens and he is forced to downgrade his lifestyle considerably.  His introduction to Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) further changes his life path, as our young automobile corporation risk assessment expert begins to reject his superficial, lonely life.  If we didn't grasp the obvious antimaterialistic tone of the script, we surely get it now, as it is literally pounded into our faces repeatedly. <br /> <br />The dialogue during this first two-thirds of the film, prior to and including most of the story involving the actual club, is absolutely brilliant, crackling with wit, insight, and great one-liners.  \\"We're a generation raised by women,\\" Pitt says at one point, in reference to the male-only club.  \\"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.\\"  And when Pitt tells his new friend he should get married, he says, \\"I can't get married.  I'm a 30-year-old boy.\\" <br /> <br />At some point this becomes a modern punk version of \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" Durden and his club becoming a gang devoted to mayhem on a national scale, taking their anger and frustration to the streets, raising their aim from personal self-destruction to that of dragging the whole world down to their level.  The club becomes a rancid cult of personality, Durden's backward spirituality permeating those around him until they become, ironically, as faceless and drone-like as the corporate workers they pretend to care about \\"freeing\\" from their lives of 9 to 5 and sitcoms. <br /> <br />But the plot twist at about the two-thirds spot of the film, while I never saw it coming, was a cheap device in my mind that completely ruined the film's earnest message for me.  An attempt to raise the bar of its own story, which was fine on its own, this twist (far be it from me to reveal anything here) came off as nothing more than an unwelcome intruder and unnecessary complication that only caused me to lose interest in what had been an unusually original, thought-provoking, brutal (in both the good and bad senses of that word) experience. <br /> <br />It basically goes downhill from there, apparently trying very hard to sell the idea that said plot twist is a real part of the story and not just another manipulation on the part of one main character.  By this time, as a viewer, I was totally lost to the story, as the film became something else entirely, spiraling down to an inexplicable ending that only leaves one saying, \\"Huh?\\" <br /> <br />I will certainly give \\"Fight Club\\" credit for its originality.  And again, it is brilliant in the extreme for its first two-thirds.  Certainly not recommended for anyone under 18, nor for the squeamish of any age, \\"Fight Club\\" is worth seeing for its clever camera tricks and editing, for its social commentary, and mostly for the remarkable prose of the words put into the actors' mouths by screenwriter Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk. <br /> <br />But the final 45 minutes or so really ruins what could have been a gripping classic piece of punk cinema, rather than the severely flawed underground cult favorite it has become.  Still, if the so-called \\"brilliant plot twist\\" were removed and the ending had been untwisted and come about a half-hour sooner, this would clearly be a five-star winner. <br /> <br />Kinda like having a great steak dinner with burnt toast for dessert.......
B00003CXCT|5.0|Just because everyone is being as stuborn as Lucas himself over a few scenes, doesn't mean you should not buy these movies. In my opinion, these movies are classics whether greedo shot first or whatever.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Forget the pointless debate about which version is the true Star Wars just for the moment and think: do you want to watch these fantastic films (which I reckon are great in both versions) in grainy old video stereo or sparkly 5.1 surround? On the evidence of today's viewing and the fabulous 2.5 hour main feature documentary this is a must have for any Star Wars fan. <br /> <br />Just one complaint from me (hence not quite a 5 star - I'd have given it 4.95 if I could): by George's own admission and that of many others this is a 'space opera'. So why do DVD producers continue to almost complete ignore the composer of Star Wars and focus only on the librettist, production and techno-geeks (God bless 'em all!)?
B000002LQR|5.0|I've had this album for years and I just listened to it again on my computer so I thought I'd jump on and write a review.<br /><br />It is such a versatile album for everyone....rock, rap, blues, funk and hip-hop.  I always listen to it in the vehicle and always get such a lift from my two favorite tracks: *I could have lied* [which has a most unbelieveable guitar solo] and *Under the bridge*.  But, as anyone will attest, the whole album is great, and lengthy, which is also a bonus.<br /><br />Hats off to the Peppers!  Great album!
B000002HEP|5.0|What a breath of fresh air!!!  I got hooked up with this CD in 2003 because of the Queens of the Stone Age connection.  Where was I when this CD came out?  Probably stuck in the mainstream with the other 90% of us.  Well, I have seen the light and it is Kyuss and the rest of the So. Cal stoner rockers.  I hate the label stoner rock, it should just be underground rock.  If you like all the usual mainstream stuff: Sabbath, Metallica, Soundgarden, etc. etc. etc. you will be glad you picked this one up.   <br /> <br />The CD would go perfect with a 100 mph drive through the Mojave on a cool crisp night.  Super-heavy guitars, prominent bass, killer drumming and top-notch vocals.  I've fired this baby up on many a Friday night at 1:00am.  You won't be skipping tracks.  Buy it now!!!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Okay, I agree that the pre-release hype for this album was ridiculous BUT why the insanely low scores?!  Despite being overhyped, this is still a very solid record.  The people who gave this a bad score probably sit around listening to White Stripes all day and faint every 30 min because of how \\"brilliant\\" it is (despite the fact that they are TERRIBLE!  Meg can't even play the drums at all and what's his name can't write songs).  If you wanna listen to crap, pick up that; if you want to listen to a slightly short and repetitive but overall solid rock album, pick up Is This It or better yet Room on Fire.
B00000DCHE|5.0|I'm almost never a fan of live concert recordings, as it seems that most of the original intensity of the show is lost and were left with a low quality recordings, but this great collection is an extraordinary exception, it really became a clear voice of a mood for me, with so many faces, it can be a great fun music to put on when you work, or when you feel like thinking and reflecting. <br />It's worth mentioning some amazing renditions in this collection, most become very emotional and intense, like \\"Summer Highland Falls\\" and \\"She's Got a Way\\" leading to shaking crescendos.  <br />This entire album is superb, but some performances transcend to literally give you goose bumps - they're just that good, the amazing performance for \\"Captain Jack\\" have even became preferable to the original studio recording, sending shivers down my spine. <br />I'm a big Billy Joel fan, granted, but regardless I think this is a great album that survived many many hearings and personal phases - good and bad, for me, an obvious 5 star. <br />Enjoy.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|To be honest I started listening to this kind of music with his debut album that touched my heart. <br />Since I have always been a fan of progressive and hard rock it's been difficult to get into new types of music. However, it is wonderful to appreciate mesmerizing music like this one. <br />The only thing that I can say is, if you liked his debut cd, buy this one, it is AWESOME.

But I really like Jack Reacher, lead character.  Cannot wait to dig into number two!
B000002H6C|3.0|This album, while not a total disaster, is extremely unfocused. Some of the songs go on way too long, have too many changes in them and are, in general, very fatiguing to listen to. Long and complex for the sake of being long and complex. On this album you can easily tell who the real musical director was. On \\"Kill Em All\\", \\"Ride...\\" and \\"Master...\\" the band was razor sharp and the songs got to the point. Here the band sounds lost and, as a consequence, the songs meander and don't hold the excitement or intensity of their predeccessors. I feel the band was far more lost without Cliff than they will ever admit to (he was the main reason behind not doing videos). Speaking of bass, there isn't any here. On the previous two albums you had to strain to hear it but here it is virtually non-existant and on top of that the guitars are eq'd very strangely that they cover up what is left in the low end. I'd be more willing to give another star if this were totally remixed (and some of the tracks shortened). So, on the whole, while this is far from their worst effort it is also way behind their best.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Anyone who considers Lars Von Trier's pitch-black comedy of human malevolence, DOGVILLE, to be anti-American must suffer from a guilty conscience. In this masterpiece that combines elements of three art forms--film, literature and theater--von Trier happens to use small-town, Depression-era America as the backdrop for his explorations into the darkest recesses of the human mind. The result is one of the freshest, most intelligent, insightful and invigorating films to come along in years, one that despite its 177-minute length never drags. DOGVILLE is filled with amazing dialogue, characterizations and performances, particularly the magnificent Nicole Kidman and the spectacularly droll narration of John Hurt, who tells the story as if it's a long, convoluted joke. Certainly not for the Michael Medveds of the world, nor for fans of the glossy, brain-dead fare spewing out of today's Hollywood, but a challenging, rewarding evening for the open-minded among us.

He shares his view, the tale, as the murder mystery draws links to the dangerous <br />research center Plum Island (the real life place where the world's most lethal viruses, bacteria, and whatever are kept--a few miles off Orient Point, Long Island New York---standing up <br />to the elements of the sea. Thank God the latest hurricanes haven't been a factor. Can you imagine managers facing a power outtage used duct tape as a sealant? And that's a reality...But let's get back to fiction.) Mister DeMille's detective is witty, enjoyable, sarcastic, and lucky. He does dabble in a romantic type ordeal. But it's more a comical read when the man shares <br />\\"then we did it.\\" <br />Fun book.
B000002LQR|5.0|Someone calling themselves 'Muzikfan' has just heard the Chili Peppers? Where have you been? Some fan... <br /> <br />I think its fair to say you should trust the other 200-odd reviews over that drivel. <br /> <br />'Funky Monks' is really the only song on this album that I don't absolutely love. It's my fave RHCP CD and probably in my top ten of all time.
B00003CXCT|5.0|38 Special sure had it right.  Haven't any of you people ever wished you could go back in life and get a \\"do over\\" because you were wronged in some way?  According to the films' creator, had George Lucas been given the finances he requested and \\"final cut\\" (an industry term refering to who gets to get final say in the editing process that usually goes to the studio), these dvd versions would've been the ones released originally.  Now be honest with yourselves -- do any of you REALLY believe in your heart of hearts that had these versions been the ones you saw first that you WOULDN'T still be huge fans or still be buying this product?  Come on.  The guy has earned the power to be able to get his \\"do over.\\"  Why don't we just give it to him and admit that these were the versions we were meant to see in the first place and that the changes ultimately don't impact why the world fell in love with the saga... because of the story and the characters.

B00028HBKC|1.0|Putting all of the religious aspects aside and merely reviewing this movie, it is one of the goriest, bloodiest, most depressing movies I've seen in years. I certainly would not recommend it for youngsters. <br /> <br />When addressing the religious aspects, this does not capture any aspect of the goodness of man or God and reflects very little of the teachings of Jesus or that time. I'm really not sure what the point of the movie was other than to capture how vicious and cruel people can be to each other. We only need to turn on the nightly news to see that. Not a movie worth seeing. <br />
0375422889|4.0|While the first volume packed historical events, the current volume delves more into personal development. The graphic novel spans her age between 14 and 26. During this period she wanders as a teenager in Vienna, returns to Iran spiritually barren and empty-handed, falls in love, gets married, gets accepted to art school, and divorces. I was most moved by her parents and grandmother. It was their affection and sacrifice that helped her move on. Will there be a third volume? It will be interesting to read about her view of the world as a mature person.
0142004235|4.0|Normally, I'm not a fan of John Steinbeck, and I wasn't sure how far I would get into this book before my normal put-it-down-and-forget-I-ever-picked-it-up reaction kicked in.  But I was very pleasantly surprised when I literally could not put this book down.  He brought the Salinas Valley and the characters to life in such vivid detail and evoked in me such strong emotions toward these characters.  I was really wowed by the biblical Garden of Eden parallels, and I really enjoyed that he didn't just start right in talking about one family.  He started out with backgrounds about Adam's and Cathy's families so I felt like I really knew them by the time they started acting out their places in the story.  I also liked how skillfully he interwove the Hamilton family into the story and how he brought in the big issues of the day--i.e. WWI--and somehow brought it down to the level of the story to make it relevant.  I felt like I was right there watching it all unfold around me.
6305907145|5.0|I have to take exception to the reviews that say this movie somehow isn't \\"faithful\\" to either Jane Austen or the novel. I think in many ways it is. A movie SHOULD attempt to interpret a novel, not just offer moving pictures to go along with the texts. And the interpretation of this particular Jane Austen film is very much in the spirit of Austen herself.  <br /> <br />I've read the novel(actually not one of my favorites either). And this film refuses to go for the easy target that we modern folks want these period pieces to do so often-envision this very idealistic time period that's full of rolling hills and romantic courtships. It really gets down to the gritty reality of a woman's status during this time period and how the family and the relationships within this unit are run like a corporation alot of the times.   <br /> <br />Understanding how the social context affects how these various relationships in Austen novels interact in various ways is key to understanding Austen and her keen eye for social commentary. This director picked up on that importance, and made one of the best Austen film treatments to date as a result. She gets Austen's spirit, not just her plotpoints.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I just read an interview with George Lucas confirming that these are the special edition and not the original trilogy.  I wish that had been disclosed before my preorder.  The restored graphics are great, the new CGI stuff looks like a video game.  Also, the jabba stuff is recycled because he couldn't make it the first time around so it was worked in later.  With all due respect to an artist, once it is out and observed, I feel that you lose the right to tinker.  Imagine if Paul McCartney took Hey Jude out of print and replaced it with a version featuring synthesizers and a speaking verse along with a chorus of seal trumpeters.  This is most disturbing indeed.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Nobody did animated features back in the 20's and 30's. The only one doing animation was some small companies and Disney, who were mainly making shorts. Walt had the idea of creating a full length feature. And while I do have some issues with the film, it's definately worth your time. <br /> <br />The Queen is a very vain woman who can't stand anyone being more beautiful than her. There is one rival though: Snow White. The Queen sends a hunter to kill her but he spares her life and she runs off. She ends up finding an old empty cottage and cleans it and passes out. Meanwhile, 7 dwarves with distinctive personalities come home and find their house clean. Eventually, they become a big family and have fun but the Queen finds out she lives and so she poisons an apple that puts all who take a bite into a coma. The dwarves have to come and save the day. <br /> <br />It's a great film full of memorable images, characters and music. However I thought it felt kinda long. When the dwarves come home, they took quite awhile before they actually find Snow White. I guess it's kind of the rookie feeling I have with the film. Disney hadn't really mastered having a long running time yet which they would greatly improve on. There is a wealth of extras also and they did a superb job restoring the film has there was a bit of color fading and scratches in the print.  <br /> <br />If you're at all into disney, I would definately suggest picking this up.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Reading all the reviews especially D. W. West \\"JediWest\\" who provide a great review and important link. I realize that all of us make these famous people who they are today, without us the world would not go round especially in Hollywood. Now Lucas had an idea in the 70's which he needed money and time. He wrote an important story and called it Star Wars. Which is by far the greatest trilogy of it's time? But from reading some of Lucas interviews and watching. I see that this man Lucas had a great idea but surely enough really didn't care about what was finally presented to the public. Now he knew that if it's going to be placed on dvd he could have both version because majority of the people who saw all 3 movies STAR WARS, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AND RETURN OF THE JEDI. Remembers the original version which debut on severely screens. Now that he has everything his respond is why should I release something that was not the final version. He should have never place it on screens until it was finish. This dvd set is not what you expect and quite frankly I prefer the VHS version. But watch on September 21, 2004, everybody is going to run and buy this 4 dvd set.
B000002KIK|3.0|As most people know, this is the last Black Sabbath studio album to feature Ozzy Osbourne (I'm not counting the two studio tracks on \\"Reunion\\").  To many, it is also the last Black Sabbath album.  The first statement is true.  The second statement is most assuredly NOT true. <br /> <br />By this point in the Sabs' history, the band were falling apart due to internal conflicts (mostly between face-of-the-band Ozzy and musical mainspring Tony Iommi), problems with management, and drugs. Ozzy had come and gone several times and was briefly replaced by ex-Savoy Brown singer Dave Walker.  Apparently some rough demos of the songs on this album exist with Walker singing and the band did a few British TV appearances with him.  But, then, Ozzy decided to come back...and he also refused to sing anything that had been written with Walker.  This resulted in the band writing songs in a theatre in Toronto, Ontario (the first time they recorded outside the UK or US) and recording them that night.  This did not make for the highest quality of material. <br /> <br />However, what's on offer here really isn't as bad as some have said, and it's not as great as some say simply because of Ozzy's appearance on it.  Tony Iommi's production is very dry (and of course he also plays very well), Ward's drums are almost \\"clattery\\" sounding and Geezer (when you can hear him) is playing quite well.  Ozzy really does turn in some credible performances that are quite pained-sounding, and authentically so, given what John Michael Osbourne was going through personally at this time. <br /> <br />One unexpected bonus on this album is the excellent keyboard work of Don Airey, one of my favourite keyboard players.  He would go on to Rainbow, Ozzy's band and Brian May, among others.  It's a pity he didn't stay with the band, because he's better than predecessor \\"Jezz\\" Woodroffe or successor Geoff Nicholls. <br /> <br />Yes, the songs do have more of a \\"jazzy\\" influence in parts, but there is still plentyof Sabbath heaviness.  Geezer's lyrics are among his best and most personal. <br /> <br />\\"Never Say Die\\" - An ironic title given that the band was splitting apart at the seams.  A good song though, if a bit poppy. <br /> <br />\\"Johnny Blade\\" - Airey's keyboards really enhance this heavy song about a street kid.  Kind of a continuation of \\"Back Street Kids\\" lyrically and kind of a personal anthem for me as a kid. <br /> <br />\\"Junior's Eyes\\" - A very good song.  Geezer's bass intro leads into Ozzy's pained vocal about losing his father, Jack Osbourne.  Probably my favourite song on the album due to its raw emotion. <br /> <br />\\"A Hard Road\\" - Some nice guitar work from Iommi but just a tad too \\"singsongy\\" for my tastes.  Another attempt at a hit single? <br /> <br />\\"Shock Wave\\" - Good song and lyrically the most like the \\"death, doom and destruction\\" Sabbath of old.  However, at this point it had started to sound cliched. <br /> <br />\\"Air Dance\\" - Not really heavy but a good song about a dancer losing her abilities.  This isn't lyrically very far removed from \\"Losing It\\" on Rush's \\"Signals\\" album of 1982. <br /> <br />\\"Over To You\\" - I think this is the weakest song on the album; it's just not that memorable.  However, there is some good keyboard work from Don Airey. <br /> <br />\\"Breakout\\" - An uncharacteristic instrumental driven by Ward's drums and a brass section (!). <br /> <br />\\"Swinging The Chain\\" - Again a song driven by Bill Ward.  He sings very good lead vocals on it (I wonder if this is one of the songs Ozzy refused to sing?) and the brass section appears again, as well as a harmonica.  From what I can tell, this is yet another song about Sabbath's legal hassles. <br /> <br />This was indeed the end of an era.  There was a tour to support this, but not many cared, especially given that the support band, an unknown California act called Van Halen, were upstaging the legendary British band almost every night. <br /> <br />Black Sabbath almost came to an end here.  Thank God Tony Iommi and Ronnie James Dio didn't allow that to happen.
B000002B5L|5.0|Before I begin reviewing this album, I'd like to tell all Fugee fans the great news.  THE FUGEES HAVE REUNITED!!!!!!!  They all performed together onstage at a Dave Chappele party last week.  Now to the album. <br /> <br />\\"How Many Mics\\": A great opener to the album.  Wyclef, Pras, and Lauryn all flow over a chilling beat.   <br />\\"Ready or Not\\": If you have never heard that amazing chorus(\\"Ready or not here I come you can't hide\\") then you're living under a rock.  This is one of the greatest Hip-Hop records ever recorded.   <br />\\"Zealots\\": One of my favorites on this album.  Pras really shows his lyrical skills on this track, and it's a shame he was so underrated by his groupmates(he has the shortest verses on all the songs on this album).  Wyclef delivers a cool chorus and he and Lauryn drop great verses also. <br />\\"The Beast\\": This is a listenable song but it isn't one of my favorites.  The beat and chorus annoy me sometimes, but the verses are great enough to save it. <br />\\"Fu-Gee-La\\": A classic reggae/rap song.  Lauryn delivers an amazing chorus and everyone once again have amazing verses. <br />\\"Family Business\\": This song is another favorite of mine.  The chorus is fast paced and very emotional.  The only thing I dislike is Pras doesn't get a verse, and is instead replaced by John Forte, who at that time wasn't anything special. <br />\\"Killing Me Softly\\": I don't usually like female R&B but this solo remake from Lauryn Hill captured my attention.  I knew Lauryn could rap great and sing pretty good, but this song proves just how great of a singer she really is.  Simply amazing! <br />\\"The Score\\": Like \\"How Many Mics\\", this song is simply about rapping.  The trio, along with the song's producer Diamond D, all drop great verses.  The classics seem to never end. <br />\\"The Mask\\": This is a good song too.  It is basically about people who wear masks to hide their true identity.  Pras, Clef, and Lauryn once again do not disappoint. <br />\\"Cowboys\\": LYRICAL FIRE!!  The Fugees spit a good old battle song with The Outsidaz(Pacewon, Young Zee, Rah Digga).  The six rappers trade verses slickly with Clef working with Pacewon, Pras working with Zee, and Lauryn working with Digga.  John Forte once again drops by at the end of the last verse, but doesn't ruin the song at all.   <br />\\"No Woman, No Cry\\": A great remake of Bob Marley's classic.  Wyclef shows his skills at singing on this song, as this is his solo song.  I really dig this joint and it is amazing once again. <br />\\"Manifest/Outro\\": This is the greatest outro of all time, simply put.  This is probably the deepest song on the entire album.  Wyclef puts himself in the place of one of Jesus' apostles, Lauryn discusses an addictive but abusive relationship, and Pras discusses the crime life.  This is one of my favorites. <br />\\"Fu-Gee-La(Refugee remix)\\": Why doesn't anyone appreciate this song.  This is a great remix, with the verses changed around a bit and John Forte actually does a good job at rapping.   <br />\\"Fu-Gee-La(remix 2)\\": I don't like this song simply because it is the same thing as the one before it.  Same lyrics, chorus, only the beat is different.  Only real filler on the album. <br />\\"Mista, Mista\\": This is actually a pretty good song.  It is another Wyclef solo, but it is very catchy.  Wyclef basically tells the story about a druggie who gets rejected when asking for money.  The song probably has the most cussing than any other song on the CD, but it is still good because of Clef's good singing and the nice piano beat. <br /> <br />The only complaints I have is the fact that Pras is underrated and that the interludes after most of the songs are annoying and unneeded.   <br /> <br />Other than that check this album out if you want a real Hip-Hop collection. <br /> <br />\\"READY OR NOT REFUGEES TAKIN OVER\\"!!   <br />
B0001MDP36|1.0|i really thought this show would be good but it is so slow and the only part i like was when renee zellweger came in she was the only one made the show worth watching maybe if they would have gotten another leading actress it would have been better but nicole kidman can not act.then that made the leading man look bad but not that  jude law  is bad by any any means but she ruined the whole show don\\"t waste your time or money
B00005JKHN|5.0|I always used to call Sleeping Beauty an updated re-telling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Princess Aurora has a magnificent voice who dreams of her prince and who has many animal friends. Prince overhears her and joins in but she gets frightened and runs off. Instead of 7 distinct dwarves, you get a shortened 3 distinct fairies. Maleficent turns into a dragon while the Queen turns into an old hag. Aurora and Snow White are put into a coma by doing something that the villain has made them do(bite the poisoned apple/prick the needle). But I greatly prefer this and even without the Snow White comparison, I still call it a classic. <br /> <br />On Aurora's birth, the entire townsfolk descends on the castle to see. 3 fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather give their gifts beauty and song. But before Merryweather gives hers, Maleficent shows up and is upset she wasn't invited. In response, she casts a spell that Aurora will prick her finger on a needle before sundown on her 16th birthday and die. Merryweather than casts a spell that instead of death, it's more of a coma that can be broken if she receives true love's first kiss. <br /> <br />Aurora, re-named Briar Rose, is now living with the 3 fairies in a cottage in the forest. While out, she encounters Prince Phillip and says for him to meet her that night. However, she gets upset and runs off. They re-enter the castle but Maleficent puts her in a trance that makes her prick her finger and on top of that, Phillip is captured. The fairies break in her castle where Phillip must get to the castle while battling Maleficent's spells, including herself. <br /> <br />Now I don't know about you, but when Maleficent turns into a dragon, it's still seems frightening even after all these years. \\"Now you must deal with me O Prince, and all the powers of HELL!\\" and she rises high in the air to become a dragon is still probably the better final battles Disney has done, which I would include with the one in Lion King and LittleMermaid. <br /> <br />It's also a really beautiful film that was shot for the first time in widescreen which required more detailed drawings and a very pristine transfer. 1 of 2 Disney films I'm recommending one after another(the other, ironically being Snow White).
0385510438|3.0|when I read the inside flap, I thought this book was going to be about knocking off the jurors. In fact, the book does not even come close to being what the title implies. I guess I liked the book but was disappointed at the end; I wasn't ready for the book to be over.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've just come here, fresh from watching this for the first time. I said it would be better reviewing it at this time since it is so vivid in my mind right now. This was one movie I kept meaning to get on DVD and watch but I never quite did, until now. I'm the type of person that finds it hard to sit through movies, especially when I'm watching them on my own. I do watch lots of them, but can find my attention wavering even through movies I like!    All I can say about this film is, my attention never once wavered, or even attempted to. It is one of the few films that has kept my attention, with a steely grip, on the screen. It's the type of film that everyone should watch, but you know won't.    Much has been made out of the 'decide for yourself' ending. Myself, I love films like that. Like Naomi Watts (my favourite actress) says in her interview in the extras, it's a movie that makes you think, who wants to see one that doesn't. Well said.    David Lynch can be an acquired taste to some. There is no doubt he is one of the most talented directors ever to exist though. He's on top form here and it's my favourite movie by him. It's weird in parts, as you would expect from Lynch. From tense moments such as the board room meeting between director Adam (Justin Theroux) and associates to moments such as Adam finding Billy Ray Cyrus (as a pool cleaner) in his wife's bed!     The plotline has been well summed up elsewhere on this page, all that needs to be said by me is that every actor and actress gives their best and it shows. No one performance is lacking, Justin Theroux as Adam is captivating, but most outstanding is Naomi Watts who plays Betty. The only words I can use to describe her performance are masterful and equissite.    Some reviewers have claimed this movie is 'pretentious', they should not be so critical. There is a difference between style and pretention. Anyone who has watched a David Lynch movie knows he doesn't do pretentious. He is really that complex and oblique. For those that hate Lynch, then I ask why would you watch this movie, as you would know you wouldn't like it!    Everyone else, please take a trip along Mulholland Drive.
B000021Y77|5.0|The only thing upon which I can agree with the previous viewer is that the character of Manni is indeed a bit annoying--not too bright, and all too willing to blame Lola for his own predicament.  This film is so taught, however, that it hardly matters. <br /> <br />Run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take-your-breath-away exciting.  The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience.  Highly, highly recommended!
1573226521|4.0|Alex Garland's book, \\"The Beach,\\" was an underground classic among the hiking and backpacking subculture long before it was made into a big-time Hollywood movie.  In it, Garland takes a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" motif and combines it with the dangers of living a hedonisitc lifestyle.  <br /> <br />Richard, the protagonist, is a 20-something searching for the ultimate adventure.  Sick of the hustle and bustle of the urban world, Richard embarks on an adventure in Thailand thinking it will bring him peace, quiet, and a simpler life.   <br /> <br />The writing is somewhat sophomoric at times, which is why this is not a five-star book.  Had Garland been more eloquent and sophisticated in his writing (which he IS very capable of), this book would possibly be considered among scholars as more of a creative fictional case-study of today's modern youth culture rather than merely a \\"pop\\" read. But then again, Garland WAS only 25 years old when he wrote it -- an impressive feat! <br /> <br />Be sure to see the movie after you read the book, as there are several significant plot differences.
B000002J03|5.0|\\"A Music Fan\\" wrote an intelligent review.  He gave this album two stars, but he backed it up.  It is interesting to read what a good reviewer, who grew up years after this music came out, has to say about it.  <br />    I too have a pretty good collection of music and music is a bit of a hobby with me. <br />    Everyone has different tastes and some albums and artists hold up better than others do over time.  And much seems to depend on what age you were when you first heard the album. <br />    I first heard LZII in high school on a road trip.  I had never heard of Led Zeppelin, so there was no power of suggestion.  I was blown away that first time and continue to be blown away by it.   <br />    I have since come to appreciate the first, more bluesy album as well; but as a straight R&R, record, Led Zep II is one of the best. <br />    They aren't gods, but they did some fine work and I've recently been inspired by a seventeen year old just discovering Zeppelin (from the Cadillac commercial, of all things) to put together a compilation of my favorite LZ tunes.  There is a lot of Zeppelin I don't care for, but there is more than enough in their catalog to fill a blank CD, and Led Zeppelin II will be well represented. <br />    There is a lot of great rock and roll out there in the archives.  I'm still discovering stuff  - album cuts, some entire albums, and occasionally a group from 30 years ago that I had never listened to or fully appreciated.  You don't have to be stuck in the past to appreciate the wealth of music created in that era. <br /> <br />     <br />
B00028HBL6|5.0|Some people dont like the movie because is too violent but i think was necesary to give us a better idea of the suffering of Jesus.When i read 1 star or 2 star reviews i realize that some people dont analize the movie in  objetive way ,violence alone isnt a reason to hate the movie .
B000000OTY|5.0|I own a lot of music...this is my favourite album of all time and the main reason I've become such a PG fan.  Everytime I listen to it I escape into my own Secret World. <br /> <br />If you really want to boost the output get yourself a copy of the concert on video or DVD.  This tour was a hallmark for theatrical concert productions and is as stimulating to watch as it is to listen to. <br /> <br />A must-have for any serious music fan, and I agree with some of these other reviews...it's healing stuff!
B000001F3C|5.0|This is definately the best of U2, im not sure how if better it compares to \\"Boy\\"
B00006G8K0|5.0|I was 7 in 1958, when this movie was released. Even at that age, I could sense something vaguely erotic about this film. I recently bought the DVD and instantly relived that feeling.  This film has the mystery and finesse of an old black and white film, but none of the over-done sensationalism of Technicolor which ruins a lot of horror films. There's something classy about the look of this production and the effortless way it seems to flow along.  The performances by all are first rate. Christopher Lee turns Dracula into a suave, well-mannered gentleman; this makes it all the more jarring when he later bursts into a room screeching just before the attack. At all times, there is this animal quality seething just below the surface that no other Dracula film seems to capture.  In this film especially, Christopher Lee's black-caped Count resembles one of Disney's animated creations, Maleficent, from Sleeping Beauty. It's interesting that these two films were produced at roughly the same time.  One of my many favorite scenes in Horror of Dracula is the simplest--the camera moves (ACTUAL camera movement--NOT a zoom lens) in for a close up of the sepulcher labelled \\"DRACULA\\", over which drops of rich, red blood spatter down. Simple, direct and not overdone. Cool.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Not sure why all the complaining in these reviews- this was a great movie. Darker, more atmospheric, less comic-booky than the first two... just plain better. Better sets, better acting, better plot... I loved this director's vision of Hogwarts.  <br />Yes, important info was left out... but only to those who read the books. This is one of those cases where I can honestly suggest (if you haven't already) see the movie first, then buy the book. You'll love each, but for different reasons.
0195067142|5.0|With the Old Breed should be required reading in our classrooms, for this is the brutal reality of war at its most horrific. No sensationalism here; E. B. Sledge merely tells it the way it was. There is no glory in war, in the shedding of another man's blood; in digging a foxhole in a torrential downpour only to uncover the badly decomposing body of a Japanese soldier crawling with maggots; in watching helplessly as four of your comrades retrieve, on a stretcher, a wounded Marine amid machinegun fire (\\"If it were me out there,\\" Sledge recounts, \\"I would want to know I wouldn't be left behind.\\"); in enduring a night while being shelled by enemy artillery; in stumbling upon fellow Marines that have been tortured, decapitated and butchered in the worst way imaginable; in suffering sleep deprivation, from malaria and jungle rot, and from hunger, thirst, and, alternately, heat and cold. This is why war should be avoided at all costs, and this is why no one man should ever be given the authority, with a flourish of his signature, to risk the lives of young men and women.<br /><br />My dad fought on Okinawa, receiving a citation from the office of the president for his participation in the taking of Shuri Ridge. I never knew my dad as a Marine, as he retired from the Corps before getting married and starting a family. I asked him once, when I was a boy, to tell me about his service, but he refused. I asked him again, about six and a half years ago, during the final year of his life, and he again refused. I had hoped that by sharing his pain a healing could take place. Unfortunately, what he saw, what he endured, died with him.<br /><br />Sledge, in this memoir of his service on Peleliu and Okinawa, told me everything my dad withheld from me. This incredible account, told with frank detachment, is hailed as the best World War II memoir of an enlisted man, and with good reason. Part adventure, part history, \\"Sledgehammer\\" not only relates many of the clich&eacute;s every Hollywood movie depicted on the subject, but also everything they left out.<br /><br />Thanks, Sledgehammer, for sharing your story, and my dad's, with me. He perhaps felt I couldn't understand what he endured. Perhaps no civilian can. Yet after having read With the Old Breed, I understand a little better why he was the way he was.<br /><br />Your generation is truly the greatest generation.n the subject, but also everything they left out.

B000005RU2|5.0|What can I say, a true masterpiece now remastered for a ultimate live experience with one of the best classic rock bands. Just perfect...    Deep Purple were on a rampage during the recording of this concert. Most of the tracks featured here are performed better than on their studios versions. 'Child In Time' is miles ahead the original, with Gillan screaming his guts out in the chorus with extre,ely tight instrumental sections and outstanding guitar playing (probably the best performance of this track). 'Black Night' and 'Strange Kind Of Woman' are performed wonderfully aswell and are also extended with additional instrumental sections.    All fans of Deep Purple and classic rock need this album! If live albums are not your thing, get this only for Ian Gillan's majestic vocal performance which is surely one of his best ever!
B00000F6LQ|5.0|First off, great movie.  and even if you don't like it, the bashing it got was uncalled for.  I guess different people have different senses of humor, but apparently the majority of the world likes this crazy british humor. <br />Second, I didn't know the first mistake pointed out, but anyone who knows the movie at all knows that there is no three-headed knight who says ni.  Theres a three headed knight and a really tall knight who says ni, but they're in different scenes, and are not the same knight.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I have watched this film many a times and recommended it twice as many. What i get in return is a mixed batch of lovers and haters of the film. People who are going to see this film must have an open mind and obove else a sense of humor. Experience with his other films will work too because there are so many annotations from his previous work in this film that just noticing them would take several viewings of the film. Of course people wont go see this film for stuff like that but i find them interesting to see.  <br /> <br />There is plenty of gore, action and Uma to keep the teenagers interested but there is also some great dialogue that didnt get enough credit as it should have by film critics. This film was classified as great cinematography and like many Tarantino films as having an awesome soundtrack, which it does. I think that this film is a balanaced combination of all techniques assciated with classic Tarantino, including dialogue which many people thought was lacking too much in. Best film of the year, for me best film of the decade, but its too early yet to determine that but for the meantime it holds the title.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|If you listen closely you will hear lots of lisps and \\"shs\\" where you should see Ray's standard immaculate enunciation...but the man does not stop his natural, progressive, physical deficiencies stop him from scuplting these lovely songs.<br /><br />Most artists at seventy-four are in wheelchairs or bedbound with their glorious skills long faded...but not Ray.  He defies age by performing these songs with such sincerity and clarity (without the need for the gimmicky multi-tracking and other tricks that are standard in R&B nowadays) that you shake your head in amazement.<br /><br />Charles gives his curtain call in style.  A great CD to keep in the player when driving back and forth from work.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am a 31 year old male who absolutely lived and breathed Star Wars as a child. I think that George Lucas is a very talented and genuinely cool guy but I have a problem with the new star wars movies phantom menace and AOTC. How in the world was he supposed to blend these in with the older ones we grew up with? I think they have so much eye candy that we can't possibly believe they happened before the ones we grew up with. I understand that the change in movie technology is tempting to a imaginitive director like Lucas but it does not work 100% for me. The special editions that came out in the late 90's did not go overboard but they surely don't have enough to fit with these new movies the last 5 years. I also do not like hayden very much and think they could have found a better person to play Anakin Skywalker. The Jar Jar Binks thing is a complete debacle if you ask me and the one person who really brought legitimacy to phantom menace was killed!(Liam Neeson). I am glad Lucas is using Christopher Lee in these movies though as he is the true last living legend of the screen in my opinion and just his presence helps a lot. Ewan Mcgregor is also doing a pretty decent job. By the way it seems obvious to me that General Palpatine is eventually indeed the evil Emperor and I figured that out right away without reading like most of us did.  But something is still wrong with this whole Star Wars thing.....too much eye candy and it is appealing more to the youthful audience then us older die hards. I agree that the older versions should have been released or atleast they should not put Hayden's face on the ghost of vader, but I do feel it is ok to have some of the subtle changes from the Special Editions intact. If they did not do that the old movies would really not fit with this new series of pre-quels. I think it is too late for us to complain though and I only hope that this May I will not be too disapointed with the next movie. Phantom Menace was a bit better then attack of the clones in my opinion but if this gets any crazier I will just stick to my old ones.of the clones in my opinion but if this gets any crazier I will just stick to my old ones.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a marriage of Kubriks Brain and Spielbergs heart. Kubrik sets a tone of the cold and artificial within and against which Spielberg urgently struggles. The sadness and beauty of the end is trancendent, just unbelievable how Spielberg follows an emotional logic. No it feels impossible to talk about it. You may not like it, its an almost religious thing.
B0000026NC|5.0|What \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" has that \\"Pulse\\" doesn't is originality, and more notably, a purpose. Released in 1988, in the wake of the post-split trauma and legal battles with former member Roger Waters, this ably recorded double live set was the group's first release of live material since the psychedelic-era \\"Ummagumma\\" in 1969. After the phenomenal success of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in 1973, Pink Floyd became an essential live act, their grand stadium/arena shows becoming a musical and visual spectacle that aficionados went so far as to call \\"a necessary experience in life.\\" So naturally, after the bitter split with Waters, who had asserted himself as the band's principle visionary, Pink Floyd was presumed dead, until longtime members David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and (slightly later) Richard Wright regrouped (but not without a fight). A resulting studio album \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" hit the Top 10 in both the US and UK, and the next step was a no-brainer; Floyd had proved they were still alive in the studio, now it was time for a 200-date concert tour to regain their territory as live kings.<br /><br />\\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" contains many features that make it an essential piece in the Floyd catalog. The first disc is mostly made up of material from the \\"Lapse\\" album, and what makes them so spectacular is that the presence of Mason and Wright is much more abundant and notable than they were in the studio versions (due to that album's long list of session players). Mason's skilled drumming is \\"all over the album\\" as Gilmour proudly put it, and Wright's keyboards make these songs sound much more like Pink Floyd music than they did on the studio album. 'On the Turning Away' is given such a magical treatment that is becomes a full-blown stadium anthem. The second disc is dedicated to familiar Floyd classics, and the results are predictably startling. Session player Scott Page's saxophone compliments and makes variations on the original sax contributions of Dick Parry, and Guy Pratt's bass is much more flexible and notable than that of Roger Waters (especially on 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 2'). It's interesting to see 'Us and Them' placed before 'Money' due to the fact that on the original \\"Dark Side\\" album, the latter segued into the former, but it still works and sounds great. The midsection of 'Money' is turned into a much more funky, loose jam, complete with fitting female backing vocals. Speaking of vocals, the verses of 'Comfortably Numb' replace Waters with a more slow, haunting, ghostly-melancholy rendition, which is very appropriate to the mood of the song, making it the best live version of the Floyd classic, complete with Gilmour's extended, emotional guitar solos. The closing crowd-pleaser 'Run Like Hell' even features synthesizer work in short notes that replicates high pitched strings.<br /><br />This is the document of a great band reclaiming their place in music, and reminding everyone of the power and startling feeling each musician placed into his performance. 1995's double live \\"Pulse\\" contained several of the same songs featured here and a less than perfect live rendition of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (and the first pressings had a blinking light on the packaging for extra measure), but it was nowhere near as inspired as \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder,\\" an essential document that saw a legendary band breathing with new life.ick Parry, and Guy Pratt's bass is much more flexible and notable than that of Roger Waters (especially on 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 2').

B000000OAN|5.0|I have been slowly replacing my beloved 70's albums with CDs and one of the first bands I replaced was Queen.  From Queen II thru The Works, and while it's hard for me to pick my #1 Queen album....er CD...this certainly always ranks at the top. <br /> <br />People may get caught up in the Freddy Mercury vocals, but make no doubt about it, these guys (Brain May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor) were some seriously talented musicians and vocalists.  And the music has passed the test of time.  I'm turning my 5 year old onto \\"good-old rock\\" music and along with the Beatles, Joe Jackson, REM, yada, yada, yada, he loves this stuff. <br /> <br />I once heard an interview with Freddy Mercury and he mentioned he never knew anything about opera and the title was just a playful, catchy thing.  And yet, Bohemian Rhapsody became one of the all time \\"rock opera\\" tunes. <br /> <br />Just put this album...er disc... on and let the music take you on a rhapsodic ride.  And if you like this disc, be sure to pick up \\"A Day At The Races\\", \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", \\"News of the World\\", \\"Jazz\\", \\"The Game\\" and take yourself back to a time when music was creative and rocking.  And don't forget, up until \\"The Game\\", Queen made all this mastery with no synthesizers.  Truely amazing stuff.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy's book, \\"God of Small Things\\" created a stir when it was published, praised and vilified by many. Called by a previous Booker judge as execrable, it still won the prize and was always controversial, with good reasons. They include, the theme, the writing style and the presentation. Both people in India and outside did not like it for a variety of reasons. People in India did not like it for the content and for the pretentious style. It was of the past and the caste system that they wish to forget and a writer makes it big in the world by reminding everyone of it, no Indian would like it. Sure, the India portrayed there does not exist except in pockets. However for people outside India, it might represent India, which Indians despise.  <br /> <br />Her story is passionate and beautifully portrayed. She has a beautiful style, though the content is tragic and depressing. Everyone I gave the book to was impressed for the writing style and the quality of the literature. Despite the detractors, it will always hold its stand among the special books about India. I have read the book multiple times to check for comparisons with other authors. I have read Rushdie and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I for one do not see too many similarities between the authors. She may be many things, but she has not copied their writing styles, they are unique. Sure, there are a few similarities. But a lot of authors have similarities. Coetzee has similarities with Dostoyevsky, it does not deter his creativity or style. Rushdie wrote about India without living in India, atleast we must give her the credit of writing about India while being in India. The only complaint I have about her is that she stopped writing fiction after that, that is unforgivable.  <br /> <br />There are few Indian authors in English who made it big. They started from R.K. Narayan who was outstanding. Most of the authors such as Rushdie, Naipaul, Mistry etc made it big outside India. She is one of the few who made it big in India in the present generation. A lot of reviewers are judging the book for the author and not the content, which is sad.  <br />

B00000K31Q|4.0|This film is a very smart and charming film. The acting is good. The dialogue is funny and also very clever. The way the actors deliver the great lines is what makes the cast very believable in each situation that they are in. The movie is entertaining and Julia Stiles has a spectacular performance. All teenagers have to like this movie because it is romantic and it deals with situations that teenagers face in their everyday life. It is worth the money.
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi is just candy for the brain that is well and charmingly written.  This is a fanciful sea survival story (which may be fiction, may be revised truth, or may be pure fantasy) with quite a bit of half-baked religious thinking of the warm fuzzy variety added to help win prizes from weak-thinking literary prize judges.  As literature it is reminiscent of Kafka in its use of animals and dream-like fantasy, but Martel is Kafka-lite.  Life of Pi has none of the rich, dark gripping textures of Kafka's works. <br /> <br />I don't think Martel's book is worthy as adventure story, religious philosophy, or as fiction.  If you want to read a genuine survival story I recommend Five Against the Sea: A True Story of Courage and Survival by Ron Arias.  For mental nourishment go back to Kafka.  Don't waste your precious time (like I did) on this mental junk food.

The cast is great and will have you entertained throught the film. The movie also sends a pretty positive message to children too. If you like Tim Burton films then you will love this one. This is the best movie he has made so far. It was definitely one of the best movies of 2003.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Listening to this album, you can't help but wonder if Kurt Cobain unearthed some long lost suitcase of unrecorded Beatles tunes and made them his own.

To say nothing of \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" which might just be the finest song ever written (in my humble opinion, of course). What else can I say? If you're new to Nirvana, then pick this one up.
B00003CXCT|3.0|The respected DVD review site, [...] who LucasFilm allowed to review the discs early is reporting the following..... <br /> <br />\\"In all the hype over the DVD release of Star Wars, I'm afraid to say there's a bit of bad news about the discs (or at least one of them) from a quality standpoint. We've discovered what we believe are serious audio defects on Episode IV - A New Hope. We've updated our DVD review of the set accordingly with the details as follows: <br /> <br />[Editor's Note: since we initially wrote this review, we've detected a number of audio/mixing errors on the DVD version of A New Hope. They are as follows: <br /> <br />1) The familiar Force theme trumpet fanfare that used to play right after Red Leader says: \\"This is it!\\" and just as the X-wings start diving towards the Death Star's surface has been dialed back in volume so that it's almost inaudible - it's almost completely buried in the surround mix. <br /> <br />2) The audio quality varies wildly as Tarkin says the line: \\"You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system.\\" - almost as if the master sound element was damaged. It's very distracting. <br /> <br />3) Possibly most critically, John Williams' entire score for the film has been flipped in the rear channels, so that what should be the left rear channel is playing from the right rear channel (and vise versa). What this means is that the rear channels don't match the front channels - instruments heard from the front right channel come from the left rear instead of the right rear. Again, this is very distracting once you notice it. <br /> <br />These problems are certainly severe enough in our opinion to merit a repressing/exchange of the disc. We're waiting to hear back from Lucasfilm on this issue and we'll update this review with the details as soon as we do.]\\" <br /> <br />
B00009ZYBY|5.0|*******<br />. . . for seven bucks more.<br />Stellar Film, Fine Features Make It a Home-Theater Must...., September 20, 2004<br /><br />I usually don't like \\"sword and sandal\\" films, \\"spaghetti westerns,\\" or films set in ancient Rome. But \\"Gladiator\\" bowled me over twice--once in the theater and once again at home courtesy of the two-disc DVD. (In fact, I consider that DVD such a staple that I'll probably screen it every year or so for years to come.)<br /><br />As you probably know, the plot takes an outstanding Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), from the site of his greatest military victory, and made him persona non grata the minute the old emperor died and the new one, his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) took over under dubious circumstances. Maximus was scheduled for execution by the insecure new emperor but escaped and headed for his villa in Spain, but it was too late--Roman troops had already crucified and burned his wife and child. Maximus suffered a nervous collapse and was sold into slavery.<br /><br />As portrayed by the powerful and versatile actor Russell Crowe, the plotwork of Maximus' struggle out of that and into \\"top billing\\" as a gladiator in Rome's Coliseum is best left to the movie; but as I alluded to before, even a short-attention-span guy like me found this meaty film downright riveting. Not to be ignored is the role of dialog and character development that intelligently and even gracefully motivates the plot. In a sense, this is the kind of epic 20th-Century Fox tried to make in 1962 with Cleopatra but generally flopped; happily, \\"Gladiator\\" deserves its already iconic status. It has everything--an epic scope, taut plotting, and performances worthy of the dialog: alongside Crowe, featured actors include the late Oliver Reed, the ever-so-slithery Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus, and wonderful Derek Jacobi as the elderly Senator who views his nutso new emperor with the detachment of a patrician and the fear of someone worried about the common people's welfare.<br /><br />Thanks to computer animation and lots of graphic design, we are put in the middle of a quite realistic 50,000-seat Coliseum. (The \\"bells and whistles\\" special-feature aspect of the DVD package include a fine documentary of the making of the film, and intelligently discusses how computer-generated imagery [\\"CGI\\"] played such a foundational role in it.)<br /><br />Oh, yes, the blood-and-guts factor at those games? The spectacles are fast, violent, bloody and (despite my every effort) intensely absorbing. And needless to say the scene when Maximus confronts Commodus, who had given him up for dead, is remarkable. your-pal-al allen smalling /<br />This is just one wonderful flick!e.

B00005JN7O|4.0|\\"Sky Captain\\" was a good movie to watch.  The scenes and images depicted in the movie make for an older person who was a child during the 1930s and 1940s a more delight for that nostalgia of comic book heroes and Hollywood glamor.  Jude Law and Gwenyth Paltrow have good chemistry as one-time lovers who still have feelings for each other.  Polly Perkins is a prototype of Lois Lane and Sky Captain is the equivalency of Superman.  Both have strong feelings for each other but they cannot have a deep and meaningful relationship because he is always out to save the world from crime and she is an ambitious career-minded woman.   <br />The movie was entertaining to watch as in sound and graphic effects, costume and set designing, and plot and action.  I have to give Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie credit for their supporting roles to help Sky Captain save the world from destruction.

0679720200|5.0|This is definitely the most thought-provoking book I have read in quite some time.  I first heard about this book from the Cure song \\"Killing an Arab\\" and thought that it would be worth checking out.  This book especially appealed to me because I feel that people are always so busy searching for ways to give their lives meaning that they don't step back and consider the whole picture.  The plot of The Stranger seems relatively simple at first; an average man is drawn into a senseless murder though a series of unlucky circumstances.  As you get further into the book it slowly gets more complicated (as does Camus' style of writing.)  Eventually you learn that the murder is not the focal point of the book, instead it is about how Meursault's attitude and actions do him in (this was termed \\"the nakedness of a man faced with the absurd\\" by Camus.)  In the end Meursault comes to realize that there is nothing he can do about death because we all die someday and somehow and when all is said and done, life is ultimately meaningless (this is the main point behind Camus' type of existentialism.)
0671027387|5.0|In the shadow of the seemingly eternal New York Times best seller The DaVinci Code, Dan Brown penned Deception Point.<br /><br />Deception Point follows intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Arctic, where she has been called by President Zachary Herney to verify a discovery made by NASA in an iceberg.  It just so happens that Rachel's father is Senator Sedgwick Sexton-the President's main threat in reelection and a staunch NASA critic, asserting that NASA spends too much money and never really does anything of worth.<br /><br />In the Arctic, Rachel meets scholar Michael Tolland, another person called on by the government to endorse the NASA find that could potentially change the history books.  Together, they discover evidence that they-and the world-have been deceived.  Rachel and Michael must then fight for their lives as they search for the person behind the lie.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding too clich&eacute;, I was on the edge of my seat through this entire book.  In true DaVinci style, Brown compels his readers to question with Deception Point.  The government and political characters are so believable that one must wonder, if Dan Brown can describe-in such detail!-a government that lies, cheats, and steals, then what could possibly be going on behind the walls of the White House right now?!  The sheer believability of the books made me love it.<br /><br />On a side note, as a true Penn State fan, I was thrilled when Rachel stayed in a room in the White House whose chest of drawers contained only an old Penn State football jersey.<br /><br />Deception Point shocked and pleased me with every turn of a page.  It appeals to conspiracy theorist in all of us, and surely deserves to step out of DaVinci's shadow.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Empire(1990). Queensryche's Fifth Studio Release.<br /><br />Late in 1990, Queensryche would release 'Empire', the album that introduced Progressive Metal genuises Queensryche to the world. Although 'Operation: Mindcrime' is generally considered their best, 'Empire' is the happy medium between Progressive Metal and Hard Rock, accessible to fans of Dream Theater and Tool but also to fans of Rush and Pink Floyd. Soon after 'Empire's release, in 1991, Nirvana and Pearl Jam took the world by storm, but that didn't stop Queensryche; the single \\"Silent Lucidity\\" reached the Top Ten, while \\"Jet City Woman\\" and \\"Best I Can\\" became huge Rock Radio hits, and 'Empire' peaked at #7 on the Billboard Charts. Try to imagine this: In 1991, 'Empire' won the People's Choice Award for the Album of the Year, around Nirvana's 'Nevermind', Pearl Jam's 'Ten, Alice In Chains 'Dirt', and Stone Temple Pilots 'Core'. For one of the few times, talent overcame popularity! So, is 'Empire' as good as fans would lead you to believe, or a weak effort? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Best I Can- Empire's opener, \\"Best I Can\\" reminds me of The Who's \\"Baba O' Reilly\\", sporting a smooth keyboard opener, but Geoff Tate soon comes out and sings an uplifting anthem. Degarmo's epic chords and the dark backup organ, not to mention the mysterious keyboard melody, make \\"Best I Can\\" a catchy, uplifting rocker you can't help but like.<br /><br />The Thin Line- Like Operation: Mindcrime's \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", \\"The Thin Line\\" is a melodic prog rocker, changing from slow, rhythm guitar-driven melodies to upbeat, epic interludes. Degarmo and Wilton's electric and rhythm guitar work is beautiful, and Tate's passionate vocals give \\"The Thin Line\\" a passionate feel.<br /><br />Jet City Woman- Empire's most recognizable track, \\"Jet City Woman\\" is a powerful tune about love and relationships, and still gets a fair amount of airplay today. Tate goes from low and saddened to upbeat and hopeful, and Degarmo's Rush-esque chords fit perfectly with the song. Imagine a Hair Metal song, without the cheese and quite a bit more serious!<br /><br />Della Brown- A rather offbeat track, \\"Della Brown\\" is a bass-laden song not unlike Pink Floyd, with slow measures interspersed with notable choruses. Degarmo rips out rhythm guitar licks worthy of James Hetfield, and his ability to play a solo is incredible. Tate's emotional vocals keep the song moving, and \\"Della Brown\\" is a slow, but ultimately rewarding track.<br /><br />Another Rainy Night(Without You)- Much like The Scorpions, \\"Another Rainy Night\\" finds Queensryche shedding much of their Progressive Metal roots, taking on power chords and emotional lyrics. Power Metal never sounded better, as Tate's \\"lost-love\\" vocals and Degarmo's rhythmic power chords blend to create a mix between \\"Rock Me Like A Hurricane\\" and Queensryche's \\"Jet City Woman\\".<br /><br />Empire- A dark track about our dying culture, \\"Empire\\" combines dark lyrics, sarcastic vocals, and doomy guitar licks to create an uncompromising look at today's degrading society. Although the \\"advertisement\\" thing is annoying, it's hard not to like this track, as it's dark tone sets it apart from the other tracks.<br /><br />Resistance- One of Queensryche's strongest, \\"Resistance\\" could have easily been a hit, a happy medium between The Scorpions and Van Halen. Tate's sing-a-long vocals are very catchy, and Degarmo's guitarmanship reminds me of Rush's modern material. Very addictive and ahead of its time.<br /><br />Silent Lucidity- Queensryche's best-known track, \\"Silent Lucidity\\" is actually much different from their other material. Featuring orchestration from Michael Kamen, Queensryche made an offbeat Pink Floyd-ish track, using Degarmo's brilliant folky rhythm guitar melody and Tate's mysterious vocals to create a ballad unlike any heard before(or after). Epic and beautiful.<br /><br />Hand On Heart- A melodic rocker, \\"Hand On Heart\\" is sure to make you pullyour lighter out and dance. Degarmo mesmerizes you with his electric symphony, and Tate sings a perfect medium between Dio and Bruce Dickinson. Another song that could, and should, have been a hit!<br /><br />One And Only- Another melodic rocker, \\"One And Only\\" combines the tone and beat of The Scorpions, the vocals of Iron Maiden, and the musicianship of Rush to create a slow, yet rewarding track.<br /><br />Anybody Listening?- \\"Anybody Listening?\\" is a song about living in the spotlight, and the best since Rush's \\"Limelight\\" to deal with the subject. The beat is very dark, with mysterious guitars and suspenseful lyrics, and the song develops into an epic rocker not unlike you'd come to expect from Dream Theater. A great ending to an album!<br /><br />In 2003, Queensryche's catalog was remastered with lyrics, expanded liner notes, and extra tracks.

B000001ESJ|4.0|Rush is a band more unique than any other. The music, the singing, everything. But more unique than anything are Rush's lyrics. It was at this point in their career that Rush started basing more and more of their songs on fantasy and mythology. Their songs make you think while rocking you. In my opinion, that is what makes a great band. Just rocking out to good music is fine, but when you finish listening and begin thinking about what you've heard, the real fun is experienced. I don't care what anyone says about Geedy Lee's voice, I personally love it. Anyway, A Farewell To Kings is one of Rush's finest moments. It starts out with \\"Farewell to Kings\\" which quickly goes from a folk-sounding acoustic piece to a hard rocking classic. This song is about bigotry and two-faced \\"leaders\\" full of hatred and greed. This song flows nicely into the epic \\"Xanadu\\", an eleven minute piece based on a poem about \\"Kubla Khan\\". This song features amazing guitar riffs, smooth time changes, and great use of the moog synthesizer. In my opinion, this is one of the best songs of Rush's entire career. Next comes \\"Closer to the Heart\\", the radio hit of the album. The song starts off quiet and slow, but turns into an pretty hard song somewhere in the middle. Alex Lifeson plays a rippin' guitar solo in this song. \\"Cinderella Man\\", the album's fourth song, is based on an old comedy called \\"Mr. Deeds Comes To Town\\". It tells of a Mandrake man's new-found wealth and his struggles along the way. Everything about this song is very good. The chorus, though the softest part, was probably the best. The next song, \\"Madrigal\\" is where the album seems to fall short. It's an okay song, but seems like filler compared to all the other songs on the album. Finally, the album ends with another epic, \\"Cygnus X-1 Book One- The Voyage\\". The song begins with what sounds like a spaceship and a creepy robot voice speaking of the black hole of Cygnus X-1. The vocals don't even start until five minutes into the song,which gives each member of the band time to do their thing. When the vocals do start, it's a full-out energetic rocker straight until the end. This song was to be continued on Rush's next album, Hemispheres. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to newcomers to Rush and big fans alike. It's worth the price alone just for \\"Farewell to Kings\\", \\"Xanadu, and \\"Cygnus X-1\\", but the other songs are great as well.
B0000025DV|5.0|Remember the double LP? If not chances are you are below 30. This album was released at a time when popular music was changing guard between disco and pop/punk, arguably in preparation for what would eventually become 80s new wave. Throughout it all album-oriented rock, the format that \\"built\\" FM radio, delivered a constant stream of anti-hits. ELO fired off this hail-Mary in tandem with an over-the-top concert tour (actual stage presence notwithstanding). <br /> <br />Unfolding the oversized LP jacket to \\"Out of the Blue\\" and beholding the airbrushed album art while listening is something that will be lost to current listeners. However the music holds up well over time, especially to those who have, over the years, distanced themselves from listening to the gloomy mechanized banality of modern radio which has since lost its soul. <br /> <br />Also a plus for the CD: It is good to be able to listen to this album in the car without some of the songs fading out and back in while the 8-track switches. Don't get me started on the \\"reprise\\" (presumably done as filler for the 8-track format) of Shine a Little Love.\\" <br /> <br />
B000084T18|4.0|50's album get rich or die trying is pretty good album. Most of the song in it are tight especially don't push me are of the hook. Some people don't gives this album the credit that it deserve it should of sold more in stores.  Most of songs have good lyrics and beats like PIMP and Patiently waiting. This CD should be in everyone collection so go out and buy it.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night!!!! FINALLY!!!  I'm glad I caught it on Turner Classic Movies.  This movie is awesome.  I am a 21 year old ADDICTED to the Classics, and after one viewing, I have fallen in love with this movie. Great Dancing, Funny Plot...what more could you ask for?!  I even was able to get my bf to watch with me!!<br /><br />I can't wait to get the DVD!!!
B000058983|4.0|Originally released in 1967, this was the band's third effort. 'Forever Changes' appears to be one of rock & roll's all-time most under rated lp's. Probably because it's technically considered to be 'hippie music'. As for myself, I think of Love to be part folk rock and part psychedelic. Love's two main members are vocalists / guitarists Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean (R.I.P.) and IF you ask me, I sort of believe that if Jimi Hendrix were alive today, he'd be a lot like Lee. As I've listened to this reissue several times, I think I may like the seven added bonus tracks -as much- as I did the actual album. The most memorable tunes are &#34;Alone Again Or&#34;, &#34;The Red Telephone&#34;, &#34;Bummer In The Summer&#34; and the bonus cuts, &#34;You Set The Scene&#34; and &#34;Your Mind And We Belong Together&#34;, which are both extended random studio rehearsals. Nice! Should appeal to fans of Moby Grape, Airplane, Buffalo Springfield and The Zombies.
B0001E7LQG|4.0|I bought this video from Hollywood Video a couple nights ago, and I enjoyed watching it.  Diane Keaton (true, she does overact) and Jack Nicholson were awesome and had great chemistry in this.  I liked watching a movie with some \\"old skool\\" actors in it.  LOL, I felt bad for poor Keanu in the end.  But all in all, it was a very amusing movie.
B0001YRVN4|4.0|I've seen some serious shredding of motion pictures in my time, but seeing the recent rout The StarWars Trilogy (Special Editions)on DVD have created takes it all. On one hand I understand the sentiments of the Old School Fans but on the other hand also agree that \\"its the filmmaker's choice\\". George Lucas created StarWars and I guess has every right to alter it as he pleases. Inspite of having grown up watching the Originals, I thought pretty well of some of the changes that were made in 1997.(The Jabba Scene,The First Flight of the Millinium Falcon, Han Solo Bumping into over a hundred storm troopers during that comic display on the Death Star,The Hoth Wompa, The look of Bespin)   <br />                I absolutely hated the Prequels and I'm dreading the Revenge of the Sith. Hayden Christensen simply cannot act and the thought of him being Darth Vader is a little difficult to Fathom. Vader brought out the Fear of God in me when I was a boy but Hayden C is some guy out of a \\"chick flick\\" who represents squat!  <br />                       But coming back to the Trilogy. The one point i'd give Lucas 100/100 on is the quality of his products. The sound in 5.1 Ex will be absolutely spectacular, the remastering of the picture will be amazing and all in all the fact that it has THX attatched to it says it all. So by & large, I'm looking forward to this as a Crisp & Clear  viewing  and listening experience at home and Yes, i'm looking forward to these DVD's Gracing my Shelf(Incidently I already have the Original Trilogy on Lazer Disc that is already on the shelf to begin with).  I'm deducting one star on the account of the changes I did not Like (Greedo Shooting First,The Idiotic band in Jabba's Palace and most of all Hayden being matted in as Anakin Skywalker in Lukes Image at The End)but that aside, I can't wait. <br />
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I read some comments about how good Peter's new album is for someone of his age. True but this album is impressive for a singer of any age and experience. I haven't heard such conviction and musicallity in this kind of music since the young Nat Cole and Sinatra. Peter obviously selects songs with lyrics he believes. Where most other young singers try too hard to make their statement, Peter's is a \\"less is more\\" interpreter as were most of the greats. This allows this great expression and believability to come through and be felt. I met Peter recently after a concert and his genuine and honest personality were consistant with what I'm hearing in his new album. I look for Peter to go on to be a big star.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Not since the Third Reich has someone put together such propoganda. It's rather obvious it's a \\"cut n paste\\" job that seeks to twist the truth buy using only half of it and then only the half that fits the scheme and fullfills the ends of it's creator. <br /> Most of this is dubunked by the 9/11 Commissions Report which I strongely urge to be read by those seeking the truth. One need only open their eyes to see the truth. Unfortunately in a free society we must put up with this kind of trash.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie really opened my eyes to what's going on in our country today.  These many different connections that the government would have us believe are \\"coincidences\\" are just too much.  There's no way anyone can truly call themselves an \\"informed voter\\" if they aren't exposed to this critical information.
B00005OBSD|5.0|I missed this one, for some reason, during the late 60's/early 70's, My mistake!! This is GREAT!! It's right up there with \\"Heartbreaker\\", or any of their releases.

I received this CD today 03/20/04 (shipped 09/15/04!!) and I feel really good about today - because of this CD. Absolutely Great.
0316666343|5.0|I read this novel almost a year after my little brother passed away. My father recommended this book to me, not so much as a source of therapy, but as a really intriguing read.  I fell in love with this book, the characters, and the author.  No other book has chilled, haunted, or moved me with such resonating themes and possibilities. As surreal as it was at times, it never strayed far enough to detach me.  Quite the opposite. Utterly engaging.  It took my breath away and restored me with hopeful imagination that I feared might have evaded me with my brother's passing.  Years after having read this novel, I am still haunted beautifully by it and always will be.
0385336810|5.0|I bought this book as I was attracted to the hip cover (the UK edition). But, after reading the first few pages, I was immediately hooked by miss kinsella's writing style (all those lists..etc.). The main character is funny without being childish or delusional (can't say the same about the shopaholic main character.. she really irritates me). Emma is a very likable character. Her quip 'No taxation without representation' really had me laughing.. not to mention all those situations that she got herself in. If there's any of you out there who didn't like the shopaholic series, don't give up on sophie kinsella. Read this instead. Trust me, you'll love it.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Trust me when I say I'm as die-hard a fan as anyone out there (okay, maybe I've never dressed up as Darth Vader or legally changed my name to \\"Yoda\\").  And I'd love to see the original films on DVD.  But, according to Lucas, that just ain't gonna happen.   <br /> <br />So I will buy the special editions.  And what's so bad about that?  Really, (unless these versions are entirely different than the theatrical releases in the 90s) the added CGI effects and scenes made no real major changes to the storyline, which is what made Star Wars so great.  (With one notable exception below).   <br /> <br />Oh no, he's added CGI effects!!!  So what, none of them took away from the movie, in my opinion. Some of them were pretty cool. <br /> <br />He's cleaned up the print and made the effects look more realistic!!  How dare he!!!   <br /> <br />He put Christensen in as Vader's ghost, because at the time ROTJ was filmed, Christensen was in diapers!!  How dare he erase that other guy, who we saw for one second in the movie, and even then under about ten pounds of makeup so that his ghost was barely recognizable.  Again, just my opinion here, but seeing that Darth Vader looked like Captain Kangaroo without the mustache was a little disappointing to me.  Of course, Hayden's not all that much better, but at least he fits in with the backstory that we have now (flawed as it is---don't get me started). <br /> <br />Which brings us to the notable exception, and the one change that really killed me.  The Greedo shoots first change.  Totally kills the character of Han Solo.  Lucas says he always meant for Greedo to shoot first.  Bull.  If that was the case, it would have been filmed that way.  Lucas says \\"how can you redeem a character who would kill in cold blood?\\" Uhhh, duh, isn't that the whole point of Han's story arc?  That he's a cold-blooded pirate who redeems himself?? <br /> <br /> My guess is Lucas has lost touch with the original thread of Han's character. Han started out as a ruthless pirate.  He was redeemed over the course of A New Hope and the later movies when he put aside that life to join the \\"good guys.\\"  Sheesh, even as a kid I could figure that out.  That's what made him so much more of a compelling character than Luke. <br /> <br />But I digress.  My point here: with a few exceptions, futzing with a few of the shots and the matte painted backgrounds is not the end of the world, and does not change the original story and spirit of the movies.  At least to me.   <br /> <br />If you don't like anything but the most pure, then don't buy it. I don't blame you for it.  We all want to hang on to our nostalgia.   <br /> <br />And if George relents and brings out the original on DVD, I'll have you guys to thank for it (seriously).   <br /> <br />And I'll go ahead and buy the original version too.  So what, it won't kill me to shell out the extra 40 bucks.  Let George be as rich as Midas and just as unhappy.   <br /> <br />
6305327084|5.0|I saw this movie on video years ago (I could have sworn the version I saw started off with Johnny Cash's \\"Ring of Fire\\" and ended with Bob Dylan's cover of the same song, but I guess I was mistaken).  A bittersweet look at male/female relationships.  Yes, Natalie Portman's character adds a certain sadness and sweetness to the story.  When Willie tells her that he doesn't want to be her \\"Pooh,\\" he shows great wisdom.  A very enjoyable film.

B00005R62N|5.0|Most of these songs are becoming rare to find in a live format.  Each and every track is quite simply early Priest at its best.  From the screaming licks that K.K. and Glen lay out to the vocal variety that is Halford, the Priest lay it on heavy and hard (for it's time).  Sure, it isn't hard by today's standards, but you ask any band where their major influences are and Judas Priest is bound to pop up.  At first I was hesitant to pick up the remastered titles, and probably would not have, but they added extra tracks, so it made it a must have.  I was able to take my original CD's to work and use them there.  My only disappointment in the remastered live album was that they didn't fill the CD with more of the classic Priest live.  If you like to hear your bands live like I do, this is one of the best.
B00004Y62T|5.0|In the opening scene, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a nice, but awkward, young man accompanies a singer at a private recital and rubs shoulders with high society, some members of whom see his (borrowed) Princeton blazer and instantly \\"adopt\\" him.  Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), a shipping magnate, soon hires him and sends him to Italy to locate his Princeton-educated son, Dickie, a playboy and wastrel who does not want to return to New York.  Though engaged to Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), a novelist, Dickie remains an independent spirit, and it is not long before he and Tom join forces at the financial expense of his father.<br /><br />Tom's greed soon gets the better of him, however, and he finds himself playing far more complex roles, with murder and mayhem following in his wake.  Matt Damon is outstanding as Tom, playing him as an innocent and socially clumsy nerd who gradually gains polish and expensive tastes.  As Tom's ambition grows and he clearly loses his grip, he is so clever that the viewer is torn between wanting him to succeed and wanting him to fail.  Jude Law (nominated for an Oscar as Best Actor for this role) plays Dickie as a spoiled playboy who has never been required to obey limits, but his vulnerability is obvious and rather touching, and Law's performance is especially memorable.<br /><br />Paltrow, the most emotionally mature of all the main characters, shows that she loves Dickie and believes that somehow she can tame him.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Freddie Miles, plays Dickie's malicious and arrogant friend as a somewhat older, but just as smarmy twit as he was in School Ties.  Cate Blanchett has a minor role in which she plays an heiress (and Gwyneth Paltrow look-alike), and though the role is small, Blanchett gives it the importance it deserves as a significant plot element.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella, who also wrote the (Academy Award-nominated) screenplay from the novel by Patricia Highsmith, has superb control of pacing and suspense, never allowing Damon to appear as evil as he is and keeping the viewer (almost) on his side.  Cinematographer John Seale shows the Italian countryside of the 1950s to its most glorious advantage, with exterior and interior scenes along the coast and in Venice, Rome, and San Remo.  Filled with music, including opera and jazz, the film includes fine new (Academy Award-nominated) music by Gabriel Yared, and the stunning final scenes, so apt, leave the viewer breathless.  Fine acting, direction, music, and cinematography make this a really memorable entertainment.

B00005JMFQ|3.0|The half dozen or so love stories that comprise \\"Love Actually\\" are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be.  This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.<br /><br />Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few.  They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval.  Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love.  The best thing about \\"Love Actually\\" is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters.  The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead.  The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale \\"only in the movies\\" moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there`s a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters.  It didn`t).  The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her.  The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt.  There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton`s portrayal of the President of the United States, a  rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light.  It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.<br /><br />\\"Love Actually\\" suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas;  some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others.  That is simply the nature of the beast.  I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie.  And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall.  Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that \\"Love Actually\\" succeeds more often than it fails.  This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny.  The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen.<br /><br />\\"Love Actually\\" is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits.  But that, perhaps, is as it should be.  Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well.n the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I saw the original star wars in the theatres in 1977 @at the age of ten.  It was not called A New Hope and I think I remember a scene in which Luke and his friend Biggs have a conversation on the planet Yavan just before the end battle sequence.  I think that scene was removed before the re release and the vhs release because it would contradict that Vader was Luke's father.  It has been 30+ years, but I wonder if anybody else remembers it.  I know that Lucasfilms has released the vhs versions a few times with different trimmings.  I do beleave as many have stated that this is a marketing ploy to sell sell sell and that the originals will ultimatly be released someday.  For allot of us it wrong to change these movies that we grew up with.  They are more then just movies to many of us they are a part of our childhood.  I therefore hold on to A New Hope (sorry I couldn't refuse) that the untouched versions will be released some day.
B00005JN7O|5.0|It's about time a movie came along and revisited those nostalgic images from 1930's-40's science fiction. This is the type of movie you watch as you flip through the comic books of your youth. Jude Law makes a dashing, updated version of the Errol Flynn style hero, and Gwenyth Paltrow channels Hepburn. I especially loved the gun that Dex created with the circular rays! The sounds they made were dead on. It's like watching a fantasy come to life. Kudos to all. Strangely enough, I didn't really like the way it looked. I thought the blown out blurry thing gave me a headache after a while,and I started longing for some real sets. But overall a fun ride and I loved it.
B000062YB1|5.0|After the impossible-to-top album \\"Reign in Blood\\", Slayer dropped off with \\"South of Heaven\\", a mediocre album by their standards.  This album was, and is, a return to glory for the thrash metal kings.  Save for a few inconsistencies and songs I could do without, this CD would be exactly on par with \\"Reign In Blood\\".  I gave \\"Reign In Blood\\" 5 stars, I would give this one 4.5 stars if I could. Since I can't, I'm giving it 5 because it is worthy of a rating beyond 4.  One of the classic metal albums in my opinion.  Oh, and to the reviewer who said this album is \\"worse than South of Heaven\\", you might want to listen to both again and ask yourself how you could possibly come to that conclusion.  Slayer fans, this album is what it is all about.  If you don't want to get the entire collection but still like the band, then at least pick up \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" and \\"Reign in  Blood\\".
B0001D0FTW|5.0|This is the best edguy album.  One of the best CD's I own.  It has everything you could want in a rock album. Awesome lyrics, and killer guitar.  Allin all, I give this album 5 stars.
0671688782|4.0|If you have ever considered using Holding Time, I recommend you read this book first. When our social worker suggested we use the technique with our daughter, I didn't understand how holding her while she tried to hurt me and get away from me would work. I thought, \\"How is making her even more mad going to help things get better?\\" As counterintuitive as it sounds, it worked and is working beautifully for us. It is helping our daughter securely attach with us and become a more relaxed and content toddler. Reading the entire book and understanding Welch's theory helped me be more confident about the technique and, in turn, use it more effectively. Be sure and read the Q & A section at the end of the book - it counters many myths and misperceptions about Holding Time. <br /> <br />There are a few reasons I give it four stars instead of five. Firstly, I disagree with Welch's model of gender roles and think that she puts undue burden on the mother to foster and maintain attachment.  Secondly, the book lacks citations that would be helpful for parents wanting to read further and dig a little deeper. Welch mentions numerous studies, but nowhere does she give references for them. Thirdly, at times she portrays Holding Time as a \\"silver bullet\\" that will solve any parenting challenge you face. Holding Time is a powerful and effective technique, but it must be used with other mindful parenting skills that foster open communication and acceptance. <br /> <br />After reading this book, the Holding Time technique makes so much sense, and now that I've seen the positive results with my own daughter, I'm a believer. <br />
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I was worried when this movie was out.  Though for many years he was known as the director with the midas touch, his two most recent films(Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow), were neither the commercial success that was predicted, nor pleasing to his fans.  This was all changed with Big Fish, a harkening back to the style that made him famous. <br /> <br />The movie is based off the relationship between a father(Ed Bloom: Ewan MaCgregor and Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The relationship is a strange one, Will has little knowlege of who his father is, his father is given to telling tall tales.  He has done this all his life, and seems to revel in being the center of attention.  But his son tires of it and after an arguement they break contact.  Until his mother calls telling him that his father is dying, and she thinks he should come home. <br /> <br />Ed Bloom then starts to tell his various life stories to his sons wife.  They are all tall tales, and distinctly American in flavor.  They range from a witch in the swamp that had a glass eye that you can see the time and manner of your death, to strange town in the boonies called Specter(you never leave because it is so perfect.  These stories are done in the tall tale fashion, Ed Bloom always seems to have the answer and always comes off as charasmatic and virtuous.  Ewan MacGregor always seems to have a grin on his face.  But they all have the traditional Burton style of warped humor. <br /> <br />This is a much mellower and more family based than some of his movies, ie the dark fairy tale \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" or insane BettleGuise.  Some of the stories still have that edge, ie the poor man living in the shadow of Bloom all his life and eventually has his woman stolen from him by Bloom, or the chinese singers who are also siamese twins.  But the stories are usually upbeat and have a positive nature to them.  His character is also made up to be the archtypical American Hero for that era.  He is a sports star, good looking, charasmatic, brave, earned his own way, and served in the war receiving honors returning to his wife after it was all over. <br /> <br />The acting was good all around, and well cast.  Ewan McGregor played his role excellently with the wide smile and thick sounthern accent.  Helen Carter has two small but memorable roles and the girl who had a crush on Bloom and the witch.  Danny Devito looks like he is having too much fun as the circus manager Amos Callaway. <br /> <br />The movie was surreal as any of Tim Burtons movies are, but he didn't let it cut into the movies emotional content.  Which was the connection that the father had with his son and wife.  Many consider this movie a tear jerker towards the end.  Making this a great movie for a broad audience, families, couples, or fanatics of Burton's cinematic vision.   <br />
0156012197|5.0|When I saw this tittle for the first time, I thought it was a gorgeous children story with great illustration. Instead I found it as an imagination story with deepness thinking and meaning. I like the story a lot, not a whole part because I still didn't understand all either. Maybe I have become a boring adult who can't see simple imaginations through that little prince's eyes, but at least I've tried. I keep that book in my hon dana so I can read parts that I like any times. I like the part when the writer drew a boa constrictor digesting an elephant, and no adult can understand the picture. Seems like adult always needs explanation. I like the part when the writer judge adults only like figures, I know that's true if you can see it through your real daily life. The writer told us about his meeting with a little prince who has three volcanoes in his planet and loves his haughty flower. The little prince has visited many other planets lived by different adults. The little prince seems confused by adult complex's way of manner. Why they can't make their life more simple, why they like being acclaimed, being admired and always busy with matters of consequence. Instead of collecting many `good things' for his own, the little prince only worried with a flower in his planet. After reading this book, I decide not to be an adult, which is impossible of course. Starting from tomorrow, I just want to slower my walking to office, just to feel more the warm of the morning sunshine above.
B0002858YS|3.0|Neo-retro. <br /> <br />Nu wave. <br /> <br />Call it whatever you want, but it's not only happening-it's growing steadily.  The trick for a band in going with an obviously derivative sound is to not come off like talent less, rip-off hacks or as straight up poseurs.  See also: Orgy who thought they could ride a singer with Goo Goo Doll looks, throw on some eye makeup for the gratuitous 80s homage and a belt out a lite metal cover of a New Order song.  Airplay for a stretch, sure.  But a band to take seriously?  Come on. <br /> <br />That's nothing like the current 80s revisionist scene that is burgeoning.  Interpol does their own phenomenal take on Joy Division and The Smiths in the same way that the Yeah Yeahs Yeahs recalls Siouxsie and The Pretenders.  And then there is The Rapture, who makes no attempt to disguise their adoration for The Cure and P.I.L.  They all need to make room for another member for the club.  <br /> <br />The Killers make their bold entrance to the ring, and perhaps into your living room via MTV spins of \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" their fantastic first single for debut effort, Hot Fuss.  It's really just updated 80s dance/rock that would make Billy Idol and The Cars proud, but would sound just as good right next to Franz Ferdinand.    <br /> <br />With thumping bass lines at the forefront, power drums crashing at every turn, huge synths blazing under frantic vocals, I had a surprisingly hard time pinning down a band I could compare them closest to.  Frankie Goes to Hollywood?  Sure, somewhat.  Blur?  A little, I guess.  After a few more turns it finally hit me.  For all of their 80s nostalgia, The Killers have a decidedly glam rock sound that is a good deal like Suede from the early 90s.    <br /> <br />The standout track on Hot Fuss is \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" which takes self-destructive, jealous paranoia way beyond the most gut wrenching Wedding Present song.  Singer Bandon Flowers appears to be on the verge of a breakdown during his play-by-play of amythical infidelity: <br /> <br />\\"Now I'm falling asleep / and she's calling a cab <br />While he's having a smoke / and she's tacking a drag <br />Now they're going to bed /and my stomach is sick <br />And it's all in my head / But she's touching his chest now <br />He takes off her dress now...letting me go\\" <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" is a galloping opener, \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" could be the Doves and has a strangely infectious anthem-like chorus of, \\"I've got soul / but I'm not a soldier.\\"   The haunted stab and weave in \\"Andy You're a Star\\" is yearning and somber, while the Casio keyboards kick in full tilt with \\"On Top.\\"   <br /> <br />The disc is frontloaded with the best songs, and the tempo is UP for the majority of it, but they do their best Pulp impersonation for the slow jam-carnival ride-of-hope conclusion of \\"Everything Will Be All Right.\\" <br /> <br />The Killers have passed the initial test with their first nu wave effort, the trick now is to remain viable in an ever changing musical landscape.  It certainly seems like they have the stuff to make it happen, if not-they'll be fun while they last. <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|With Nu Metal finally slowing down, and that all the underground metal bands are starting to rise, Lamb Of God are one of those bands that show the posers how REAL American Heavy Metal is made. These guys just keep getting better and heavier with every release. Ashes Of The Wake, the band's third album, and their first with Epic, is just incredible. The opening track \\"Laid To Rest\\" is just addictive. The lyrics here are just what you expect from this band. Vocalist Randy Blythe shows no remorse or emotion whatsoever, just pure jaw dropping rage, hate, and anger. Will Alder and Mark Morton's hate filled twin guitar riffs and John Campbell's bass work rip you madly like a chainsaw, and of course Chris Alder's catchy work behind the drum kit will keep your head banging for days. Other highlights include the title track (which has some awesome guitar solos), \\"Hourglass\\", \\"One Gun\\", \\"Remorse Is For The Dead\\", \\"What I've Become\\", \\"The Faded Line\\", and \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For. If you're looking for some great new heavy metal albums this year, buy Lamb Of God's Ashes Of The Wake, and if you can't, go back and listen to some worthless 80's hair metal crap. I'm talkin about Poison, Cinderella, Warrant, Stryper, LA Guns, and Europe. Those bands aren't even around anymore. The 80's are dead, this is the new millenium, and Lamb Of God are leading the charge. STAY HEAVY.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|This record really shows how much Peter has grown musically since his first CD. You hear the emotion in his voice throughout the entire record, his piano playing is amazing, and his song writing is particularly touching. The hip hop influenced Bali Hai, the funky St. Louis Blues, the cinematic On The Moon, the poignant He's Watching, and the amazingly virtuosic Cherokee, are all stand out tracks. I can't imagine anyone NOT liking this cd. See for yourself. <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I don't care what all the haters say, this album is one of 2004's best. Slipknot's new album Vol 3. The Subliminal Verses is already a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I do like Iowa and the self titled album, but Vol 3 shows both heaviness and melody, and of course maturity as well. Singer Corey Taylor show wonderful melody with his singing, and he does sound a bit different when he screams and shouts. Joey Jordison is already one of the best metal drummers today. His double bass drum work is just fast, just listen to The Blister Exists and you;ll know what I mean. There is even guitar solos on this album, especially on Pulse Of The Maggots (my personal favorite), kudos to lead guitarist Mick Thompson. Other great songs include: Duality, Three Nil, Vermilion Pts 1 and 2, Opium Of The People, Before I Forget, and The Nameless. Slipknot Rules, buy this album now.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV is arguably Zeppelins best album, If not it is at least their most popular. It was on Led Zeppelin IV that Zeppelin created their biggest masterpeice Stairway to Heaven. (A song that still today is heavily requested on Rock Stations)IV is an album that excelled it's days and has basically became a peice of rock n roll history. From Robert's first wail on Black Dog, to the funky sounds of When the Levee Breaks you will be hooked. IV has a nearly magical element to it all listeners will enjoy.
B000000OSE|4.0|It took me a long time to like the Use Your Illusions. They're just so different from Appetite for Destruction. But once i started to get into them i realized they're quite excellent. This one being my favourite of the 2.  <br /> <br />The first track (Right Next Door to Hell) isn't anything special. But it does rock and the guitar's cool. There are a few other tracks like this on here ( #5 Perfect Crime,#7 Back Off B*tch, #14 Bad Apples, & #13 Don't Damn Me).  <br /> <br />I really love Izzy Stradlin's influence in the Illusions. On this one he wrote most of the songs (though only sings vocals on 3 of them). His songs are bluesy and dark... talking about drugs, women, that kind of thing.  <br /> <br />Coma is a jem (it's the last song). 10 minutes long and a real \\"epic\\" so to speak. Axl's lyrics are very cool.  <br /> <br />The Garden (#11), Garden of Eden (#12), Dead Horse (#15), and Bad Obsession (#8) all fall into the category of decent songs that i'd probably rate as 7/10. Except for Garden of Eden...which i like more just cause the video is friggin amusing. <br /> <br />Finally the poor songs. These being the singles Live and Let Die, Don't Cry, and November Rain. I heard them on the radio and got a completely wrong idea about the context of this record. These songs, to me, are just too sappy and glamorous to be hailed as real Guns n' Roses. <br /> <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|How the West was won captures Led Zeppelin at their prime, Kings of the world that changed music forever. The sound is encredibly pure and the album has a very personal feel to it. Most of their best known songs are on here from the guitar frenzied Black Dog, to the 23 minute long Whole Lotta Love. Any Zeppelin fan will fan will love this CD, and many casual fans will also find some glory in this collection.
B00009V7P8|4.0|So I have read several reviewers compare Damien Rice to artists such as Jeff Buckley, Ryan Adams, someone even mentioned Howie Day.  I would like to suggest this album to fans of David Gray as well.  What I love so much about David Gray is the same thing I find in Damien Rice's music -- the instant connection, the expressive nature, the passion in his voice.  Yeah, his voice isn't perfect, but it is so simple and moving... you feel what he is feeling, and no amount of voice lessons or production work can bring that experience.  Check out Damien Rice, and check out David Gray while you're at it.
B000053GTK|5.0|This album is so ridiculously overlooked. From start to finish you are whisked away, downtown to beyond the infinite. I cried (real tears) after purchasing this masterpiece. This is brave, brilliant and off the charts. If you don't own this, or haven't heard this, you have lived an incomplete life. Complete your life and hear this. You won't be disappointed, prog fans.<br /><br />Sleeve51
B00003CXCT|1.0|All this carping about Lucas having the RIGHT to endlessly tweak his films because HE is the creator of them misses the point entirely.  There's more at stake here than artistic freedom. I'm happy for Lucas to put out the \\"special editions\\" as alternate versions, but he has a responsibility to preserve the originals, too.  Failing to transfer them to digital format now means that, eventually, they will be GONE FOREVER; that we will lose one of the most significant pieces of twentieth-century popular culture.  The fact that Lucas seems quite happy for this to happen is sickening.  It shows he has no real understanding of the place of his work in the public culture.  Once you do something as big and as loved as \\"Star Wars\\", in a very real sense it doesn't belong to you anymore.  It belongs to the culture.  It belongs to history.  What's his argument against this?  \\"I want it my way.\\"  One would have thought that a man who has traded on a Jedi philosophy that paints ego, selfishness and the love of power as the paths to darkness would have been a little less selfish than this.  And forgive me if I can't take Lucas's claim to \\"artistic integrity\\" seriously - after Jar Jar, he clearly has none.
068987474X|5.0|I abs. loved this book. I finished it in one day.  I think what's so empowering about the message is that as a together woman, we treat ourselves so well in so many areas of our lives.  However, for some reason when it comes to men, we are contented to settle for second best in hopes that a person we are into will come around.  It is important to realize that you are a beautiful woman with an interesting life.  You do not want to take time out of your wonderful life to bother with a man who is not treating you the way you deserve.   <br />The bottom line: If you have to constantly deal with infinite excuses then this man is clearly not worth your time and you will forever be unhappy with the way he treats you.  I much rather hold out for a man that completely adores me rather than waste my time with a prick that has 101 excuses as to why he can not treat me the way I deserve to be treated. <br />I too will purchase a copy for all my friends:)
0807014265|2.0|Because that's what it sounds like to me. Some people decide life sucks. Frankly, if coming from a concentration camp inmate, I don't think anyone has any right to suggest that is not a valid position.  <br /> <br />Any camp memoir has plenty of examples of the arbitrariness of who got to live and who got to die. Frankl survived by pure chance several times. I don't think we can accept his insinuation that those circumstances were somehow due to his wonderful philosophies.  <br /> <br />I am genuinely pleased for him that he found something that worked for him in the face of the annihilation of his family, and the book is indeed full of inspiring ways of looking at the world. However I find it simplistic in the extreme and  bordering on the offensive that he seems to believe that what worked for him can and should work for everyone else,  particularly when he uses the behaviours of those who gave up and/or died for other reasons (occasionally he seems to blur the distinction) as an example of how not to live.  <br /> <br />I also find his little nuggets of wisdom and anecdotes of how with a simple sentence he turned patients' lives around to be extremely obnoxious. Ditto his unfortunate insinuation that the only thing that can give a woman's life meaning is to have children.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have no problem with Lucas releasing these versions of the film to DVD. I just wish he'd either made 2 different sets availabe (ex: 1. original, pre-special ed. cut and 2. Special Ed.) or had simply included both versions in one set...which has been done for other films.  <br /> <br />Also, to clear up something mentioned in another review: I do not wish to see Han shoot first because I want him to be a \\"cold-blooded killer.\\" I want to see him shoot first because Greedo was there to kill him or take him in and, Han would be smart enough to waste his a$$. It makes both characters look stupid: A. It makes Greedo look like a sorry bounty hunter to miss point-blank. B. It makes Han look slow. Part of the fun is seeing Han transfrom from a mercenary to a hero. There is no reason he could not kill Greedo and still be a good guy.  <br /> <br />Also, I WILL buy these editions on DVD but, thank God I also have DVD copies of the Pre-Special Edition cuts from Laser Disc. That gives me the best of both worlds and a CHOICE....which is all the fans want anyway.
B0002O06N0|4.0|This guitar and drum duo strikes again, and does to Foghat, Free, and Grand Funk Railroad what the White Stripes did to Led Zep. Is that too cryptic? Here's what I mean to say: this is big, warm, riff-oriented, 70's arena rock, dripping with reverb, and speaking with a slight delta blues inflection. It feels a little mainstream, and maybe not quite as urgent as their prior EPs, but c'mon, man, why does it always have to matter what other people think? Turn up the volume, then serve The Black Keys chilled with anything from The Dirtbombs to Chuck Berry. If you hate this album, buy it anyway. It'll be totally ironic.  <br /> <br />Despite the fact these short, straightforward songs tickle my fancy, I'm tempted to give the album three stars because it feels a little too much like I'm riding through the 70's in a white van waiting for Van Halen to debut. However, this album has a way of growing on you. I'll give it four stars today, but I reserve the right to give it five tomorrow.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Never have I seen a movie, let alone any documentary, that could in its short span of play, elicit more emotional transitions on me than this one film. I laughed, I cried, sometimes I was just dumbfounded, but the most profound impact was that the voices that spoke in the film felt closer to me than my neighbour.  <br /> <br />While much has been written that this is
B00001U0DP|5.0|Roberto Benigni in this film has displayed genius about life.  Life is about parents protecting their children from the holocaust and helping them survive.  He showed genius in winning the love of his life, in protecting his son from the cruelty of others and in sacrificing himself for his son.  Is slapstick appropriate for the subject ?  It is when seen in the eyes of a father glancing at his son and knowing that these people will kill his son if he does not keep his son \\"in the game\\".  I am a dad; I would do anything for my children... this is Benigni's genius...
B00000IAU3|5.0|To put it simply, No Angel is as near perfection as any album I have ever heard. There is not one song here that is not entirely original, and Dido's combination of wonderful melodies with spot-on vocals is unbelievable. <br /> <br />Track Ratings- <br /> <br />1) Here With Me- 9/10- nice chorus, but slightly unmemorable. <br />2) Hunter 10/10- simply perfect song with a great beat and catchy lyrics <br />3) Don't Think of Me- 7/10- the only average song on the album, this is song is OK but rather overblown. <br />4) My Lover's Gone- 9/10- simple and beautiful love song <br />5) All You Want 10/10- I love her vocals on this song, which also has a lovely melody and great lyrics, with a twist at the end. <br />6) Thankyou- 9.5/10- great opening which was made famous in Eminem's song Stan- the chorus doesn't really fit though. <br />7) Honestly OK- 8.5/10- this requires a few listens, but is a song where we can truly appreciate Dido's vocal talents. <br />8) Slide- 9/10- great rhytm and chorus <br />9) Isobel- 9.5/10- Touching lyrics and a great buildup to a good chorus <br />10) I'm No Angel- 10/10- for me the best song on the album- this track just blows you away with a very different, slick melody, great lyrics and vocals. <br />11) My Life- 8/10- this is just solid filler, with rather ordinary lyrics <br />12) Take My Hand- 8.5/10- this was a bonus track and is rather different, substituting the smooth rhytm of I'm No Angel with a slower, more sober love song beat.
B000001E18|5.0|This is not u2s finest work, but it is still a musical masterpiece!  On top of the universe after the release of \\"Achtung Baby\\" and the infamous ZooTV Tour, u2 took a bigger risk than ever and went as far away from the \\"u2 sound\\" as possible with this release.  u2, and the production of Eno, make this a experimental classic!   <br /> <br />ZOOROPA: A brilliant opener, mysterious with almost silence the first two minutes, then the dark guitar work by the Edge.  Incredible track! Great lyrics and delivery by Bono (\\"and I have no religion, and I don't know what's what, and I don't know the limit, the limit of what we got...) Untouchable!!! <br /> <br />BABYFACE: Fun and catchy tune about watching porn, resembles TTTYAATW from Achtung Baby, just a cool track, they didnt want to make \\"With or Without You\\" with this song.  <br /> <br />NUMB: Amazing experimentation with this song, just because Edge does the vocals.  Very innovative idea behind \\"Numb,\\" lyrics are great and the video is even better. <br /> <br />LEMON: One of the strongest on the album, amazing voice by Bono and the sounds off this track are just funky! The bassline is phenominal by Adam Clayton, the one negative is that it is too long. <br /> <br />STAY: One of u2's best moments.  Simple as that.  Musical perfection!  It's a song that Edge likes to say, just \\"arrives.\\" <br /> <br />CRASHED CAR: the first 30 seconds alone make this a great tune, awesome beat, very addictive song. <br /> <br />SOMEDAYS: My only filler on the album, never really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />THE FIRST TIME: Amazing lyrics by Bono, very deep and the piano and ending to this song still gives me chills!  <br /> <br />DIRTY DAY: Although sounding much better live, it is a great tune with great guitar work by Edge and Adam Clayton.  Bono's lyrics are top notch on this one. <br /> <br />THE WANDERER:  Maybe the best lyrics I've ever seen, fit Johnny Cash's style so perfectly.  What a way to end an album, with the legend singing and taking over.   <br /> <br />A warning to people first listening to this: You will probably not like it that much! It took me about a year having it in my collection to truly grown on me and appreciate it.  It is one of my favorite u2 albums, it is truly a genius piece of work! With its perfect sounds and experimentation, pick it up and discover it over and over and over again.... <br />
0425170349|3.0|With the fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent dismantlement of the Warsaw Pact, Tom Clancy lost his chief villain (as did James Bond) and had to scour the planet for new villains.  These new villains included the drug cartel, terrorists, disgruntled Native Americans, ex-KGB agents, the Chinese, socialized medicine, the Japanese and tree-huggers (with tree-huggers being the worst of them all).      Thus we come to the book that I am reviewing, \\"Rainbow Six,\\" which is entirely focused on the actions and thoughts  of John Clark and Chavez Ding.  Clark's been given a job where he'll lead a team of multi-national anti-terrorist super soldiers.  And when I say `multi-national', I only mean three nations.  There are a few Americans, some Brits and one German  who are all stationed at a military base in England.  All is well until trouble starts brewing on the other side of the Atlantic.  Several eco-friendly scientists and one cowboy are developing a virus designated `Ebola Shiva' and plan to wipe out pretty much all of humanity (except for themselves of course).  Why?  Because humanity (or rather the extremely large bulk of it) has abused poor Mother Nature long enough.  The tree-huggers shall inherit the Earth!     This revelation depressed me.  `So, the entire book is just an extended Bond-style plot?' is what I first asked myself.  Then after finishing the book, I answered myself with a simple `Yes.'  But the fundamentally weak plot didn't prevent me from highly enjoying certain spots (such as a hostage rescue at a theme park or the final assault on the eco-terrorists).  Also I really enjoyed the display of militaristic technology in this book, which is best personified via the `tricorders.'  These `tricorders' are devices that allow its user to detect the heartbeats of targets behind walls or in the great outdoors.     However, Clancy's books are more about the sum rather than the parts.  So in the end, \\"Rainbow Six\\" has entertaining parts but a weak sum.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars is Star Wars!! Noone complained about Alien 1-3, Apocalpse Nw or Blade Runner, so why all the fuzz?? <br />A reviewer pointed to this article <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />and said that Lucas didn't care about his fans; that's only halfway true. What he says. is: <br />\\"...I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be. I'm the one who has to take responsibility for it. I'm the one who has to have everybody throw rocks at me all the time, so at least if they're going to throw rocks at me, they're going to throw rocks at me for something I love rather than something I think is not very good, or at least something I think is not finished...\\" and later \\"...but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen, and they think it should be their way. Which is fine, except I'm making the movies, so I should have it my way...\\" <br />So there, live with it, get over yourselves! I'm 36, so I was around when the original movies were released and have seen each of them around 35 times. The Special Editions don't detract from the joy...on the contrary, I'm exited to see what's new! <br />Buy or buy not...there is no in between....and it's your choice.
B000007T1M|4.0|This is such a cool CD.  Seriously, it's so awsome and heavy.  Parts of it will stay with you until you die, even if you never hear it again.  I have to say the best lyric is from Suite Pee: \\"I wanna F*CK my way to the garden, cuz everyone...needs...a mother...F*CKEEERRR!!!\\".  Anyway, the songs are all really meaningful.  The cool thing about SOAD is that they only mean what you interpret in their songs.  You make what you want of them.  They're an awsome band and this is an awsome CD.  I just won the \\"Limited Edition Tour CD\\" off of ebay, which is a preview of this CD for DJ's with three songs off of this, both live and recorded.  The disk is blue.  It's cool.  Anyway, this is an awsome CD, so much.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|As I have seen this movie in theaters (many times),  I can't wait until I get this movie on DVD.  It is about the legend war of Troy and telling the story about Achilles. <br /> <br />Some people says it is not better than Gladiator.  They might be right but I say it is like Gladiator (even I'm fan of the great movie GLADIATOR) and I think this is a different story in a different approach.  Gladiator is about a great worrior who was bytrated and he fought for the old empror's beleives, while Troy is about two (or a lot of) great nations fighting for the bad and good.  It is about the greed of the power and gaining new lands and new resources. <br /> <br />It is about....  well enough talking about Troy (2004) Just buy it and add it to your special collection :)
B00007E8V4|4.0|This is another cd from SOAD.  The only downside is that there's no insert, and no lyrics.  The website you get from it doesn't seem to work for me.  Anyway, this CD seems to have even more political meaning than either of the other 2.  I'm anxious for the next one to come out.  Anyway, some songs on here like \\"Boom!\\" are definately meant to have some meaning without the listener thinking about it.  So unlike their other Cd's there are some lyrics that have blatant meaning, other than that it's all about what you think they're saying.  This is definately worth it. <br />
B00005JN2X|5.0|With two of my all-time favorite movies directed by Mann (\\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\"), and having Cruise as one of my favorite actors, I couldn't resist the temptation to check out \\"Collateral\\". And I wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />As Mann has us used to, he has you on the edge of your seat all through the movie, with some fantastic dialog and some great directing and photography, something that has made him legendary by now, with his unique treatment of light and shadows. Interestingly enough, the script's credit this time falls in the lap of Stuart Beattie, one of the co-writers for \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", a 'first time' for Mann, who normally writes or adapts the script himself.<br /><br />As for Cruise and his interaction on the screen with Foxx, it's a perfect match. Cruise: what else can you say about him that has not been said? I guess, the fact that he plays a damn good bad guy! Interesting that he'd be a fourth choice for the role after Rusell Crowe was considered for it, and both, Edward Norton and Colin Farrell, were offered the chance to play Vincent. As for Foxx (\\"Ali\\", \\"Any Given Sunday\\"), he too does a fine job, consolidating him along with Will Smith as the top talent in a solid new generation of african americans following the lead of Denzel Washington.<br /><br />All in all, one solid blend of tasteful directing, great camerawork, engaging dialogs and acting, and tying it all together in the background, an eclectic soundtrack combining the musical talent of James Newton Howard.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is my favorite CD of all time probably.  The songs have so much political and social meaning to me.  System of a Down probably has just a hint of an intended meaning in their songs, but they don't care how you take their lyrics.  That's the whole point.  Their songs only mean what they mean to you.  So much people say they're a religeous band and a political band, it's not true.  They sing and dance about what they see around them in this world.  This CD is so great though.  Shimmy is probably my favorite song now.  I think it's about the insane subjugating school system.  Some awsome tunes and lyrics here.
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Piccoult weaves a thought-provoking and heartbreaking story of what happens when a family member is dying of leukemia.  Sara and Brian Fitzgerald had dreams like any other young couple for their daughter Kate and son Jesse.  However, their life is turned upside down when Kate is diagnosed at age two with acute promyelocytic leukemia. They desperately seek every possible cure for their daughter.  In the process, the entire family becomes acquainted with the doctors, nurses, local hospitals, and medical symptoms associated with leukemia. When the issue of a bone marrow transplant arises they discover that son Jesse is not a match and an outside donor would be too risky.  Their daughter Anna arrives and is a suitable donor.  For the first thirteen years of her life, Anna's activities and her school attendance, are dictated by Kate's health.  At age thirteen, Anna hires a lawyer and seeks to obtain medical emancipation from her parents. The debate grows whether at age thirteen she can make such difficult decisions. The story unfolds from multiple points of views, the family, Anna's lawyer, her court appointed guardian. The narrative flip-flops over the course of Kate's life. The reader learns a little about each character and how they cope with what seems inevitable sadness. The trial reveals how there are no winners in this battle. The ending is filled with sadness and with slight hope of surviving tragedy. Anyone who reads this book will react with emotion and be challenged by the issues and the attitudes it presents.  It is a story that on the last page, the last sentence, you turn to the next page looking for more.
B0002IU988|5.0|I have never written a review for a CD before, but after listening to Alter Bridge, I had to!<br /><br />I wasn't really interested in hearing Alter Bridge because I didn't think that they would have much to offer without the lead singer, Scott.  But, boy, was I WRONG!  Let me be frank, I am over 40 years old, married to a drummer, and have spent the last few years being very unimpressed by what new bands have to offer.  I always fell back on my old favorites when it came time to pick a CD for a road trip, or just driving around town.  Stuff like Queensryche, Dream Theater, Journey, The Eagles, Boston, Bon Jovi, mostly the 80's stuff I grew up with.<br /><br />I have only been pleasantly surprised by the writing, talent of the musicians, and the vocals of a couple of new bands lately - -RA and Evanesence. These two bands found themselves in my CD rotation quite frequently because of the OBVIOUS genius of the song writers and the powerful voice that is evident in each track.<br /><br />Then along comes Alter Bridge.  Honestly, I liked Creed, but I never rushed out to buy the new releases as I did this one.  My 17 year old nephew suggested it to me, but I passed it over.  Then my best friend, also in her 40's told me she had bought it and loved it, so I gave it a try.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.<br /><br />I don't know where Myles Kennedy came from, but what a find.  His range is unbelievable.  He can get gritty and sexy one minute, and then let his voice soar so high that chills erupt down your spine.  (I can't wait 'til they release a DVD, I will be one of the first to pre-order!!!!!!)<br /><br />Marc Tremonti shows his passion and his obvious faith, but tells his stories in his songs in ways anyone of any age group or religion can understand.  His guitar tells stories of its own in each of the songs, but never gets predictable.<br /><br />Brian Marshall impresses me because for years in each of the bands that my musician husband has put together, the GOOD bass players were few and far between.  It is obvious that Brian, Marc, and Scott are part of that select fraternity of groups that can play as One Voice.<br /><br />And, what can I say, I married a drummer.  I am very hard to please when listening to anyone else play, but Scott Phillips has it all.  Energy, Skill, Originality, Confidence....all the things that drew me to my husband all those years ago.<br /><br />All in all, I guess it is obvious that I am not sorry that Creed broke up now that I have finally listened to Alter Bridge.  I think that this one will definitely top the charts of my new favorites for years to come.  Keep the new music coming guys, you can pre-sell me a copy today!!!!!!!!!!!OOD bass players were few and far between.

B000244FDW|5.0|this 1980's version was released on DVD. Like so many others, I had purchased the VHS, 2 tape copy and was disappointed in seeing a good amount was edited out. I remember seeing it when it was aired on Masterpiece Theater over a five week period. It instantly become my favorite British presentation, apart from \\"Flambards\\".  <br /> <br />I have also seen the 1996 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I liked the version very much. Colin did an excellent portrayal of Mr. Darcy and Jennifer was a lovely Elizabeth, but I never forget this earlier version. I kept picturing Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul when I watched the newer P&P and realized, they will always be Elizabeth and Darcy to me. <br /> <br />This older version perfectly captured the overall feel of the novel. True, Rintoul's performance was stiff compared to Colin Firth's, but I honestly feel he really showed the proud and arrogant Mr. Darcy of Jane Austen's story. Sorry, but Colin Firth was just too likable. Elizabeth Garvie was dead on as Elizabeth. She was exactly how I pictured Elizabeth to be. Jennifer Ehle seemed too cheerful at times and was missing some of the archiness and wit that Garvie displayed.  <br /> <br />My favorite scene in this version was when Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at Pemberly. It was word for word from the book,  with every embarrassed look and uneasy feeling captured. The newer version I would said followed the story line more. There were several scenes in this older version that were condensed, such as when Elizabeth visits Charlotte in Hunsford. And the newer version adds scenes which I thought was unneccessary. <br /> <br />I have a hard time choosing between the two version since both were wonderful in their own special way. But if I had to choose, then this 1979 version would be number one with the 1996, a very, very close second.  The main reason being whenever I think of Mr. Darcy, I see David Rintoul!
B000005S6B|5.0|although i buy many things from amazon-books, movies, games for my grandson this is the first review that i have written.  not because the things i bought weren't wonderful but because i think shane macgowan and the pogues are important to our culture.  i just recently discovered this album which has led me to buy more albums.  this is a wonderful introduction to celtic punk music and the genius of shane macgowan's writing.  this album combines both \\"drinking\\" Irish songs along with very haunting Irish songs with Fairytale of New York and If I should Fall from Grace With God being my favorites.  my only complaint is that i did not discover this group until now.  when things were not especially good between the Irish and the English this group of young men have a place in history because they took their Irish Punk Band into Enland and gave the Irish people a reason to be proud. they are responsible for influencing a whole new wave of celtic punk music.  this album is just an absolute must for any Irish-American.  don't expect traditional Danny Boy-shane and the pogues come at you with hard-driving lyrics along with hard-driving banjo, mandolin, accordian, guitar, tin whistle and whatever else they could find i imagine.  i never thought i would become fond of the tin whistle-mainly because i had never even heard of a tin whistle. <br /> <br />i feel so strongly about their influence that i have been buying albums for friends and relatives. i can now even understand every word they sing which took a little bit of patience to understand the heavy brogue! <br /> <br />buy the album and enjoy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Tomorrow the Star Wars trilogy will finally be released on DVD, and today I am watching Return of the Jedi on DVD. You're probably wondering why that is, well, it's one of the great perks to working in a video store. It's great, the picture is great, all of the original material is intact. The only problem most people are having with it is the added material that Lucas added to the movie a few years ago.<br /><br />It's ridiculous for the uproar over the use of the special editions for the DVD's that are coming out. This is the way Lucas wanted it to come out originally, and as the artist in this situation he has ever right to add what he wants to artistically.<br /><br />Of course most of the problems that people have stem from the question: Who shot first, Greedo or Han? I read an interview with George Lucas where he said that the main reason people want to think Han shot first is because you kind of want him to be a cold blooded killer, but he isn't that type of person. The way Lucas originally envisioned it was that they either both shot together, or Greedo shot a hair before Han. But it completely makes sense for him to fix that misunderstanding.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie and say that I love every change that was made, I don't particualarly care for the musical number in the Jabba the Hut scene at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. And Jabba doesn't quite look right in his new scene in A New Hope. But these do add somewhat of a greater understanding to the storylines they inhabit.<br /><br />Allow George Lucas to do what he will to his films, the movies he created. None of you were the artist behind the script, or the artist behind the camera, so allow that artist to do what he will and just enjoy the ride.
0395389496|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" by Chris Van Allsburg is a must-have for holiday reading.  The wonderful story and great pictures pull readers in and keeps them interested throughout the entire story. The story begins when a little boy boards a train filled with many other children on their way to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.  Upon arrival, Santa picks the little boy to receive the first Christmas gift of the year.  The little boy chooses one of the bells from the reindeers' harness.  The boy loses the bell on the way home, but gets it back on Christmas morning from Santa Claus.  This story is one that children will want to read over and over again.
0385335482|5.0|I LOVED this book!  This one, Takes Manhattan and Ties the Knot!  I haven't read the sister one yet but I am going to!!!  Becky is hysterical! <br />I highly recommend this book to all stay at home moms who have a chance to read while the baby is sleeping!!! and while the dishes are drying! and the clothes are in the washer!  and when everybody else is sleeping except you!!!  The only bad thing is that the book is so good I read it so fast and then I have withdrawls!
B00001QEG5|5.0|If the credits says Dee Snider wrote it, you know it's gonna be awsome. This album is just as good (if not better) than other TS albums. When I first heard this (on my birthday) I was surprised how awsome it is (no weak track, even the bonus tracks, every song gets a 10/10). This album also helped make my friend a TS fan as well. Since this album is hardly ever talked about, I thought it wouldn't be that great but it rocks. <br /> <br />
0380789035|3.0|Odin, the All-Father, is back. \\"The long dark tea-time of the soul\\" may not be Douglas Adams at his prime, but seems inspirational enough to provide the backbone of another Gaiman's book. This time fictional. His admiration for the work of the now late DA had previously incarnated in \\"Don't panic\\", a (kind of) biography centered on \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". This isn't supposed to be a detractor of this book. I found it a very enjoyable read, and 3 1/2 would certainly better reflect how I apreciated it. Not a masterpiece by any means though.
B00005JN7O|3.0|Based on the hype, I was expecting something bigger than the Indiana Jones movies.  What this film lacked, was a character as dynamic as Indiana Jones and a plausible storyline.  Also, it appeared that this movie was filmed in black and white and then colorized (to give it an old movie feel).  I think it might have been better if they just stuck to black and white (I hate the look of colorized movies). <br /> <br />There were a lot of good special effects, such as when Gwyenneth Paltrow is manuvering through skyscrapper sized mechanical men and some comic relief that you had to be quick to catch (there is an image of Godzilla attacking Tokyo).  Angelina Jolie is the highlight of the movie, giving a fine performance as a very proper British commander of an armada of flying aircraft carriers (if that makes sense).  I think a sequel with her character as the star would work a lot better. <br /> <br />
B00005JN7O|4.0|The future is now people, and with \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" director Kerry Conran is determined to make sure that we know it.  Using artificial sets and spectacular CGI, the first-time filmmaker delivers an adventure that's too big to be real. <br /> <br />\\"Sky Captain\\" begins with a bang and never lets up. Giant-sized robots descend upon 1930's New York City, destroying anything in their path.  The robots are sent to kidnap scientists and machinery needed by the evil Dr. Totenkopf.  It's up to Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan to stop the rampage.  When his inventor sidekick (Giovanni Ribisi, is also kidnapped, he teams up with ace reporter and ex-flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) to save the day. <br /> <br />What makes \\"Sky Captain\\" so great is the love and effort Conran put into this movie.  This is his first feature film, but it's better than half of the movies that have been released within the past five years.  The action is fast but you are still able to tell what's going on.  There are no fancy edits or slow-motion bullet time, yet even the most attention deficit viewers shouldn't have a problem keeping their eyes on the screen.    <br /> <br />This film will be remembered mostly for being the first to be shot entirely in front of a blue screen.  None of the sets are real.  Conran filmed the actors and then spent several years working on the rest of the film, adding in everything else.  We've seen this kind of thing before, most notably in the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels, but never to this extent.  The robots, the cityscape, the cars, almost everything is CGI.  Even the actor who plays the film's villain is a special effect as he's played by Laurence Olivier, who died in 1989.  While there are a few shots where the blue screen technique is quite obvious, the final product shows that there was some real talent behind the effects work.  Though they don't look photo realistic, the effects create an alternate world that's easy to fall into. <br /> <br />Like most big effects pictures, the plot comes second.  In this case, however, this isn't such a bad thing.  \\"Sky Captain's\\" story comes straight out of the pulp, sci-fi tales of yesteryear.  It's nothing but pure escapism and doesn't need to be complicated.  Conran, who also wrote the script, knows his stuff and keeps the film in homage territory without turning it into one big rip-off.  The one big flaw of \\"Sky Captain\\" is that the characters are almost as simple as the story.  We are given very little history on Joe Sullivan.  He's a hero because the filmmakers need him to be.  He lacks the in-depth persona or background story of such great adventures as Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Polly Perkins isn't afraid to get the story, but we don't know why she's so driven.  Though they seem a little empty, the characters are still likeable, especially Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), who should really appeal to fans of Marvel Comics' Nick Fury.     <br /> <br />Many have said that \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is the new \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Indiana Jones\\".  It's not, but it comes pretty close.  If a future episode gives us a little more character this will be the new adventure epic that fans of the genre have been waiting for. <br /> <br />RATING:  A- or 4  out of 5 stars <br />
B00018D3RI|5.0|It was great reliving my old crushes on Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul (I could never choose)!! I still remembered some specific scenes just like they were yesterday. S&H accurately portrayed the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, giving it a sort of \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" feel, with an added touch of humor. I had fun picking out guest stars who went on to bigger fame.  <br /> <br />Sure, some of the production values were cheesy--such as Starsky wearing the same clothes for several episodes, and a green Chevy Impala blowing up one week and then appearing in the next episode--but this was 70's TV, people! They kept production costs down by reusing props and shooting several episodes in a day. Try that with the cast of Friends. HA!  <br /> <br />If you're a child of the 70s..and even if you're not..get out your bellbottoms, plaid shirts and Adidas and watch this DVD.
0316548189|5.0|The Boston Globe wrote that this book \\"should be read by every person alive\\" and I wholeheartedly agree.  Mandela is an excellent writer, and his story is an amazing demonstration of perseverance and forgiveness.  His reliance on simple values-- truth, the importance of listening, dignity-- reveal how tragically far societies can stray from the basic principles they should be safeguarding. <br /> <br />Read this book, and pass it on (and don't be intimidated by the 600 or so pages).  We should all listen to Mandela's lessons.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is atrociously horrible.  I'm neither a Bush nor a Kerry fan, but I must say that if you value our own opinion at all do not watch Michael Moore's lastest pile of lies and trash.  This man has such a vendeta against the current President that he doesn't care about ethics, morals, or anything else that America values.  Having Michael Moore think for you is worse than having GW think for you.  Make your own decisions, do your own research.  Of course that means you'll have to watch this movie to understand why Moore is easily the largest (literally and figuratively) propagandist since Hitler.  But when November comes, make your own choice.  Don't let this blowhard decide for you.
B00000JPH6|1.0|We recently viewed this movie after reading rave reviews about it on this website.  Having seen it, we can safely say that we've never experienced such a waste of our lives as we did seeing The Dark Crystal.  We believe we are now dumber for having seen it.  It lacks any sort of artistry, plot, dialogue, basically anything that you would hope a movie would contain.  We saw the movie with a group of eight.  By the end of the movie, only two had survived this insult to our intelligence as human beings (And the only reason those two stayed to watch nasty buzzards and annoying gophers for two hours was because one was stubborn and the other was drunk).  We hate to go on and on, but there is such a rage inside of us now, we actually want to physically hurt people who find this movie enjoyable.  The fact that there are 201 other reviewers out there that actually liked this movie challenges our faith in humanity.  Don't get us wrong--we have nothing against movies such as Labyrinth or The Muppets, but if you're going to make a movie, for God's sake make it a movie about something!
B000050FEN|3.0|After reading all of the many and sundry reviews for Se7en, I was ready for something really dark, really disturbing, really stylized. I was ready to be wowed. Maybe I'm just another member of the titillation generation, but I saw nothing here that was any more interesting than any number of other thrillers or dramas.<br /><br />Some notes: For a film that has generated so many \\"gore\\" complaints, there is almost no gore or violence here. Only two of the murders are fully realized as setpieces, the rest are glossed over. In once scene, dozens of squad cars and a laser-guided-weapon-armed SWAT team are sent in to search for one suspect named \\"John Doe.\\" This alone should tell you a lot of what you need to know about this film. Despite the \\"cleverness\\" everyone talks about, the film isn't even tidy; there are eight deaths (assuming that Brad Pitt's character is executed), not seven.<br /><br />I guess I just expected much, much more. Sorry, but this film just isn't that dark, isn't that dreary, mainly because it overplays/under-respects its hand. It would have been better with less \\"action,\\" fewer weepy scenes with underdeveloped characters, and fewer cliches. It would also have been better if more time were given to the seven deadly sins setpieces.<br /><br />I was hoping for a film that really brought the potential of the premise to fruition... seven deadly sins, seven truly horrific setpieces and a baroque, gothic, noir feel. Instead, we get seven deadly sins but only two murder setpieces, one extra murder that's just for the hell of it, one pregnancy subplot, a Cracker Jack box prize for a detective story, and a gimmicky ending. I've much had darker, more dreary afternoons at the city Zoo.<br /><br />Bleh. Three stars for nice cinematography and for the basic premise, which is still excellent. I'd like to see someone with real talent rewrite/reshoot this one and take it to a better and/or more consistent, stronger conclusion.
B00001IVOR|3.0|this album is alright. if u see it for a cheap price then get it, but if its full-price (which it normally is) don't get it. my fave songs on this album are: \\"reunited, \\"for heavens sake\\", \\"triumph\\" & \\"severe punishment\\".

B00008WT5M|3.0|I am by nature a contrarian, which I regard as one of my better traits. However, I wish I weren't sometimes, and this is one of them: AC/DC is a band of legendary status, and I don't want anyone out there to think I'm busting their chops. <br /> <br />That said, I cannot agree with all the reviewers who rated this with 5 stars, and saw this album as the antithesis of their mid-'80s slump. I liked their trio of excellent albums from that period (in order, \\"Flick of the Switch,\\" \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" and \\"Fly on the Wall\\"). I really think that \\"The Razor's Edge\\" belongs with \\"Fly on the Wall,\\" truthfully: There are some really excellent songs on this album, but there's the matter of a wee bit too much filler. <br /> <br />First, let us deal with what makes this album work: The title track is total killer and starts off with a nice \\"Bach rock\\" solo on the part of Angus. \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Moneytalks\\" are two superior tunes that indeed announce to the world that AC/DC has not rolled over and played dead, that they doeth still the world rule. \\"Moneytalks\\" hearkens back to the Bon Scott era kind of songs you heard on \\"High Voltage,\\" \\"Let There Be Rock\\" and \\"Highway to Hell.\\" Really clever ditty, that. <br /> <br />I am also glad to hear Brian Johnson's voice in the forefront, whereas with \\"Blow Up Your Video\\" and \\"Fly On the Wall,\\" he sounded as though he was miked from across the room. His voice is a bit more scratchy here than on previous outings, but I like that bluesy, gravelly quality. <br /> <br />\\"Shot of Love\\" is my favorite on this album. It has a cool backbeat and Brian Johnson spits out the lyrics cantankerously. \\"Are You Ready\\" is a great party and drinking song and makes for an excellent stadium-rousing anthem. <br /> <br />\\"Mistress for Christmas\\" is a nice novelty tune, but if the song's subject were less, shall we say, specialized, it would just be another filler track. <br /> <br />However, I am not convinced that this album really does set AC/DC apart from their mid-to-late '80s stuff: I challenge anyone to show that \\"Fire Your Guns,\\" \\"Rock Your Heart Out,\\" \\"Got You by the Balls,\\" \\"Let's Make It,\\" \\"Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck\\" and \\"If You Dare\\" are anything save a recycling of their '80s filler songs. That's SIX songs that are arguably filler, and if you compare them to the non-hits on \\"Back In Black\\" such as \\"Have a Drink on Me\\" and \\"Shake A Leg,\\" or \\"For Those About to Rock.....\\"'s \\"Inject the Venom\\" and \\"C.O.D.\\", they are not nearly as unique or solid. <br /> <br />That, and Chris Slade's by-the-book drumming do not for an unassailable classic make. Their true comeback album, headlined by the return of original drummer Phil Rudd, would not happen for another five years, until 1995's \\"Ballbreaker.\\"
B00004RFCM|1.0|It's because its \\"star\\" is Sarah Jessica Parker. \\"Sex and the City\\"? That is false advertising. With Parker at the helm of personnae dramatis, it ought to have been called \\"Skank and the City.\\" <br /> <br />I was as aroused by this show as I was by staring at yesterday's pizza. According to the product info, this item is not for sale to anyone under the age of 18, which is quite paradoxical, as it is written, acted and produced for women who have never mentally matured above the age of 13.
0312305060|3.0|To write a good book, it is not enough to write it as a hommage to an author that is already established and with that thought try to conceal some lame constructions inside text.<br /><br />Cunnigham has indeed taken a grasp of interwoven lives of tree women and his story is, in some manner brilliantly told, with emotions, with strange enough lives to keep readers occupied and all that goes with it.<br /><br />But sometimes, as he forgettes himself he slips controversial comment or thought every now and then which is totally out of place, with book as whole or with characters as they are.<br /><br />Though provoking it is not heart gripping and it is one of those books that will be read in one afternoon never to be read again.<br /><br />Given some more effort this could have been a marvelous book, but in it's present state it is just an average piece of literature...
B00006IUL2|5.0|I first saw Medea in college and was highly critical of it, finding it disappointing on almost all counts:  terrible sound editing, cheap film stock, over bright lighting, bizarre, amateurish acting styles, inadequately edited, etc. Then there was the extended murder scene of Glauce and Creon going seemingly on forever, and then . . . wait; what's this?  It's repeated all over again? Did someone get the wrong reel into the house? <br /> <br />Another ten years went by before I watched it again and after the second viewing, found myself emotionally drained, my jaw on the floor with the realization that I'd just finished a film that alternately horrified, fascinated and astonished me. <br /> <br />Medea is a grim, violent, film, minimally processed which only adds to its gruesome, wild rawness.  This is Pasolini's Medea, not Euripedes and it is not easy viewing.  Its wild, African/Middle Eastern score with the nasal bleating of women's voices in near pre-historic sounding rhythmic chant adds further to the element of being \\"out there\\" this film produces:  This is about as far away from popular cinema as one can get.  Medea doesn't easily compare to films of any other style or genre; not even with some of Pasolini's other work.    But, if you can succumb to its hypnotic, mesmerizing pace at once both frenetic and static - you will realize this is as about as close to a hallucinatory experience one can achieve without the use of an illegal substance. Granted, not everyone wants that experience. <br /> <br />As Medea, Callas is simply amazing.  Oddly, when the film came out she was roundly criticized for not being able to transfer the magic she so naturally gave on stage to the big screen.  I will strongly disagree.  The more I watch this film (which is probably several times a year for well over a decade), the more amazed I am by her performance in it.  Where I, too, had first been critical of her languid weirdness, I've grown to see her <br />commitment to the role.  I've come to be riveted to her painfully expressive mask as she completely inhabits this character who is, quite literally, capable of everything (yes - everything is the right word here). <br /> <br />Where I was once critical of the lighting, I've grown up to realize what Pasolini did; why he chose to film at the times of day he chose, and the resulting, fascinatingly brutal and surreal luminosity that bathes the entire film and the almost palpable sense of its visual texture. Stunning.  The landscapes Pasolini chose to film in are as brutal and as vital as the characters of the tale.  His near excision of all spoken text (  the screenplay is nearly dialogue free) brings us into a timeless, yet somehow ancient world where all is understood without the use of verbal communication.  The savage, bloody rites of sacrifices for fertility and harvest initially seem barbarous then become somehow beautiful and fascinating.  Then they make one cringe with the realization of how, not so long ago, this was us. <br /> <br />A remarkable, savage and beautiful film.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have seen several Sitcoms, as well as standup and slapstick comedy. Seinfeld is a concept beyond all that I have ever experiences: 20-25 minutes of pure, uninhibited humor. If you can't see that, then you're either one of those overly sensitive types, or you just don't get it. This is simply the greatest SHOW ever created.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|There is this trend in major label \\"indie\\" rock at the moment.  Everybody is ripping off Gang of Four!  This band is no exception.  Sometimes they are ripping off Wire, but most of the time it sounds like a poor copy of Gang of Four's early sound (late 70's).  I'm actually very surprised that none of the reviews I read mentioned how much this band sounds like them.  Some of the songs here are catchy, yes, but when you consider how much they are trying to sound like Gang of Four, it's kinda lame.  I only gave it 3 stars because at least they are ripping off a good band.  So many bands today directly derive their sound from bands that came before them. You almost have to rate them on just WHO they are ripping off instead of rating them on their ORIGINAL sound.  Just because most people today probably aren't aware of Gang of Four's early records isn't a good reason to rip them off.  Be inspired by them, but take it somewhere else.  Do something else with what you learned from them; merge it with some other band's sound, at least. <br /> <br />Anyways, if you haven't already, I suggest you guys check out Gang of Four's debut LP \\"Entertainment!\\".  You will be shocked and surprised at how ahead of it's time it was.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I gotta confess,I didn't know what to expect when I  <br />bought this DVD.At best,I thought it would be a mediocre  <br />Metallica concert while the symphony plays silently in  <br />the background.I was so wrong!!!First,the concert hall  <br />fits perfectly.Everything was planned out carefully. <br /> <br />The set list is great.When you hear 'Ktulu','Of wolf and men', <br />'Bleeding me','Whom the bell tolls' & 'One' you'll see what I mean.Actually,all the songs are great.There are two new songs: <br />'No leaf clover' and 'Minus Human'.'Clover' is amazing,taking full advantage of the 100+ symphony members.This DVD has replayable value.I watch it every day,at least a part of it,and I find new positive things about it every day.Example:The song 'Outlaw torn' from 'LOAD'.I didn't listen to it enough to like it.But the version on S&M is f.....g amazing.I love it now. <br />Same goes for 'Hero of the day'. <br /> <br />And the symphony isn't just sitting in the background.Symphony gave every song a breath of fresh air.Like a fifth Metallica member.I especially like when Hetfield sings 'Master of puppets' with the crowd.Hammet changed almost every solo a little bit and they still sound great.Jason is a energy bomb.When you hear his 'hoi!hoi!hoi!'you will do that with the crowd.Lars is frightening good in 'Bells'.In short,this DVD is definitely worth your time and money.Buy it and enjoy!!!
B0002OERI0|1.0|greenday not good on this album. by dookie instead of this waste of an album.
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot is one of the best rock albums I've heard all year.  Green Day just refuses to keep playing the same thing over and over, and making new and great music.  The band has steadily matured since the Dookie days.  The harsher, darker Insomniac.  The diverse and musically-expanding Nimrod.  The melodic and artistic Warning.  And now the rock opera, American Idiot.   <br /> <br />In a market clouded by manufactured music that sells and quality music that gets ignored, it's good to see Green Day evolving yet continuing to produce quality music.  The best part is that they still get media attention.  It'd be a shame to see this one get lost in the shuffle.  Albums such as this and Velvet Revolver's Contraband are 2004's attempts to revive rock, and it's taken veterans of the genre.   <br /> <br />I wrote a review of Warning in 2000, when I was a freshman in high school and only liked hard and fast rock and found Warning to be a disappointment.  I wish I could take that review back, since I've matured a lot since then as Green Day did.  Finding appreciation for quality music has been my biggest personal growth over the past few years.  Thank goodness the days where I listened to Limp Bizkit have passed.   <br /> <br />As a run-down of each song: <br /> <br />1. American Idiot (5/5): Catchy first single.  Very reminiscent of some of their older material but still catchy as hell. <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia (5/5): First masterpiece of the album.  This 9-minute epic never gets old, with the highlight being the hard-rocking \\"I don't care.\\"  Lyrically sound and has some nice transitions. <br /> <br />3. Holiday (5/5): One of my favorites from the album.  Perhaps the harshest lyrics from the album, the crunching guitar riffs echo this into the album's biggest political anthem.  Nicely done. <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams (5/5): Continuing from Holiday, this song is very different for Green Day.  Simply put, another great one.  Catchy as hell with lots of emotion from Billie Joe.  Nice ending with the crushing guitars. <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting? (3/5): Not bad, but short.  Nice little anthemic sing-along chorus, though. <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy (3/5): Obligatory hyper-fast song, but is a little too \\"storyish\\" for my tastes, repeating \\"St. Jimmy\\" way too many times.  While the song is trademark Green Day, it seems a little out of place.  The second half where it slows down is really cool, but could have done without the \\"and don't wear it out\\" bit at the end. <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine (4/5): Again, not something that I expected from Green Day, but really moody verses with an unexpected heavy chorus.  Really like this one. <br /> <br />8. She's a Rebel (4/5): Trademark Green Day.  Chorus reminds me a bit of something from Warning, only distorted.  Perfect 2-minute song. <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl (2/5): The only song I don't really like hear.  The song should have been like the opening drum beats, but instead went in a different direction that wasn't too catchy.  I usually skip this one. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb (5/5): Throwback to Insomniac here with a Warning-ish melody but depressing lyrics.  One of my favorites. <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends (5/5): One of Green Day's best written songs.  I was surprised when it went heavy, I though it was going to be like Good Riddance or Macy's Day Parade.  Truly amazing. <br /> <br />12. Homecoming (4/5): Not as good as Jesus of Suburbia, this one has some good stuff and some bad stuff.  The opening part didn't really do anything for me.  Death of St. Jimmy then picked up and was very rockin'.  East 12th Street then killed the songs momentum again until it sped up.  And then Mike's \\"Nobody Likes You\\" killed the momentum again (although it was cool to hear him sing for once.)  Tre's \\"Rock & Roll Girlfriend\\" adds a little humor to the album, which continues into the next area nicely.  The very beginning of \\"We're coming home again\\" is my favorite part of this song, just because of the marching bass melody.  The end of the song is a bit repetitive with Billie Joe repeating the same line over and over, but it was cool to hear it end with Mike's line once more.  Also like how \\"Don't wanna be an American Idiot\\" was fitted into Tre's song. <br /> <br />13. Whatsername (5/5): Nice, sad little closer.  Really gives you the feeling that something has come to an end, as the album closes. <br /> <br />All in all, it was definitely worth the wait, but it's hard to fathom what could be next from the boys.  Let's hope they keep on crankin' out quality music while keeping things fresh.  Green Day has shown that while they are growing up, they sure aren't burning out.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|This is not, as one reviewer has suggested, a rip-off of LotR. Rather, this is another retelling of the journey of the hero along the lines suggested by Campbell. This is filmmaking at its finest, and also a great expression of the post-modern film. After all, this is a film that is always in process, much like Whitman's Leaves of Grass. If you haven't seen Star Wars as an adult who enjoys film, then look at it again. And this is the perfect format for it.
B000051VWW|5.0|Who'd have thought that after an eight year layoff, and roughly  fifteen years after their debut, Sade would deliver their most consistant, most rewarding, most SOLID album ever. I have followed Sade since \\"Smooth Operator\\" was a huge hit on the pop chart and found them to be a pleasant \\"alternative to the alternative\\" of the late eighties, early nineties music that was (mostly, in my opinion ) crap. A few of Sade's albums have been a bit heavy on the filler, with a few amazing songs and brilliant singles sprinkled throughout. Lovers Rock is astounding, there is not one song on this album I skip over. They were smart not to resort to cramming the entire cd full, as most newer pop artists do, in the age of compact discs.   ( Knowing that you can  fit 80 minutes of music on a disc is one thing, knowing that you have enough good songs to do it is quite another. I can name TOO MANY pop and soul artists who are doing the former, not The latter.) Soulful, rhythmic, thoughful, considered music. Beautiful vocals, as always. Ms. Adu's  voice  grows more mature, more assured with each outing. The musical arrangements are mostly quite spare, and the production is crystal clear. I love the way you can hear the fingers sliding up the fret board of the guitar during the chord changes in  \\"Every Word\\". In this case, less is definitely more. You won't find trendy, slick  beats, layers of synthesizers, or digital trickery. Just the band, Sade, in all its glory.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Admittedly the premise behind this movie of an ex-porn starlet moving next-door to a high school (reluctantly term him geek though that shoe is a little large for his niche in high school heirarchy) is stretching things. This movie though takes that plot and runs with it in a highly clever fashion.    From the opening scenes whereby the population of the high school scribble in their year book memories obliviously labeling themselves amongst the high school social order hooked my attention. Emile Hirsh(Presumably a relative new-comer to the Hollywood movie scene as he was unbeknownst to me) fits in his role admirably. As a young man struggling with his self-and familial imposed expectations while wanting to cut loose and enjoy some of the experiences he watches from the classroom window as the \\"rebels\\" cut class to hit the beach and party.    His life changes when he spies the gorgeous blonde neighbour changing prompting her to confront and befriend him.    Soon the two main characters are swept away in the early tides of romance, until the revelation of Elisha's ex-porn profession hits the lad like a ton of bricks. Other obstacles include her ex-producer/boyfriend (brilliantly played) and a school project to import a genuis from overseas to the school (which wasn't an obstacle until the ex-producer showed up).    This film is at heart a romantic comedy, but it appeals to the cynical/jaded audience of the twenty first century not only because of the plot, dark comedy and acting but because it has an edge shining through all the above factors insuring it isn't some mushy lovey dovey story.    This is a romantic comedy for the 21st century.    Finally an apology to Elisha Cuthbert. I had seen some episodes of the critically and audience acclaimed 24 and always thought she looked wooden onscreen. After seeing her acting abilities in this movie I now realize I was judging her talents unfairly. She can not only act(She fulfills this role as if it was written for her andperhaps it was). As an added bonus she is Canadian yay ms. Cuthbert.    This movie is as much a social commentary(another one I know but one of the better ones) on high school and a surprisingly moving love story in which I totally rooted for Matthew and Danielle.
B000002LCK|4.0|If you have no New Order, this 2cd set  is the place to start. And many of these songs are not on standard  releases, so it's a good place to get some  harder to find material, for the more than  casual fan.  It covers the early years ( in my opinion the best ). Forget the naysayers who gripe about the  re-recordings of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\" - they are technically  better sounding , and manage to retain the energy and urgency of the original versions. The first disc is rounded out with a few  12\\" singles - the definitive Shep Pettibone remix of \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" being one highlight. But the b-sides on the second disc are what I like best about Substance. They track New Order's development from haunting atmospheric pieces to electro-dance experiments on to highly rhythmic instrumentals with  tribal drums that sound a bit like Pornography-era Cure, then more electronic esoterica and a  little dance-floor fun. It  ends with  \\"1963\\", a sentimental pop-rocker so good it should have at least been on an album, if not a single itself.
B00003CXCT|3.0|While I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I have to give the thumbs up to Steven Spielberg for taking the high road when it comes to one of his best loved films: ET. While for a new generation and for gentler times Spielberg redid some parts of ET. However, when it came to releasing the film on DVD, Spielberg released the original version as well as the new version. For this, and this alone, Mr. Spielberg has risen in my estimation of a film maker with true integrity.  <br /> <br />Not so with Mr. Lucas. The versions of the Star Wars trilogy on DVD are not the original versions but tweaked versions of the 97 Special Editions. While some of the effects have been improved over the 97 counterparts, the overall effect is jarring. The picture quality is staggering and looks spectacular. The sound is even better, with the exception of the obvious errors in Star Wars (No I will not call it Episode IV: A New Hope).  <br /> <br />Against my better judgement I purchased this set, and I will enjoy it for the special features. The sad fact is that the REAL Star Wars Trilogy is still only available on VHS, Laser Disc and bootleg DVD. If you love the original versions, save yourself the money and don't buy this set. Instead, go to [...] and join the battle to get the original versions on DVD.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I too am disappointed with this record.  I liked the first listen, but then I quickly started skipping tracks and now I don't play it at all because it's boring.  There's too much overlapping in it, one minutes it's metal, next minute it's poppy.
0783226845|5.0|Irascible war veteran teaches impressionable ivy leaguer-in-training a couple of life lessons during a weekend getaway. In his portrayal of a fallen hero blinded by his own nihilism, Pacino attains something close to an apotheosis.
1400031354|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the first title in the series, but found Tears of the Giraffe to be even more beautifully written and difficult to put down.  The characters continue to develop nicely, and the storylines are compelling and full of surprises.  It's one of the best books I've come across in years, and feel like a better person for having read it.  <br /> <br />Anyone who enjoyed the opening book in the series will certainly enjoy this title as well.
B000003TA9|5.0|I'm not a die hard Sonic Youth fan, but this is the album that really hit me. \\"Wish Fulfillment\\" has become my new anthem. There's such a fantastic mixture here of raw and pretty and heartfelt and humor here that it becomes irristable. Highly recomended.
1400034779|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it.  The writing is simple, and effortlessly creates well-developed characters by exploring their inner thoughts as events (even the run-of-the-mill) develop.  The story is indeed \\"heart-warming\\" and reassuring without at all being corny.  The moral lessons are beautiful-- comforting like a childrens' book-- but for adults. <br /> <br />The only trouble is that the second book in the series (Tears of the Giraffe) is even better than the first.  I hope that anyone who isn't completely impressed with this first installment goes on to read the next.
B000068GA4|5.0|Even though I ain't into satanism, I cannot but hail this album as one of the best rock albums ever along with How the Gods Kill. Every song is these albums are awesome and their undeniable darkness is just luring. I have always felt that even though Glen is the brains behind Danzig, Chuck Biscuits simple and powerfull drumming and John Christ's straightforward riffs and solos contributed immensely to the overall performance and unique sound. It's a shame that Glen has lost this kind of inspiration, specially after Danzig 4.Make yourself a favor and buy this one of a kind cd.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever!!!  I recommend everyone see it.  I don't believe that people understand what Jesus did for us.  He gave his life for us, who could never even come close to deserving it.  The pain that he went through while people mocked him, spit on him, humiliated him and he didn't have to go through it, but he did because HE LOVES US! <br />   <br />This movie gives as accurate portrayal of what Jesus did for us as you can get.  James Cavaziel gave an amazing performace.  I don't think anyone could have done any better.   <br /> <br />I believe that Mel Gibson was following GOD in this and I appreciate that someone will stand up for what he believes in and not be ashamed to say that he is a Christian and He loves GOD.   <br /> <br />As for me, I give it 5 stars, and recommend everyone to watch it.  I believe that it will change your life.  I am a Christian and had heard the story of Jesus all of my life, but seeing this movie really opened my eyes to what he went through for me, and everyone else.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Discover the paralleled power and glory of the Gladiator, a dazeling combination of vivd action and extraordinary unforgettable epic motion picture. This movie is simply magnificent and just mind catching it is just spectacular. The movie begins with a character known as Maxiums the commander of the Roman army and the evil emperor Commudus. He sends for the death of Maximums, which he then escapes and wonders on to the dersert and is sold to a man who trains gladiator. Later on he becomes a gladiator and fights and is seen by all, that he is a skilled fighter and earns the respect of the people and his fellow fighters. Then he confrunted by a conflict that changes his view in life, he sees his wife and child hung and burned to death and his house destroyed.He is then confronted by the emperor and is challenged to a fight to the death. No one Konws that he was sopose to be the emperor but Lucilla the sister of Commdus. Later on he is confronted by him and is staved underneath his ribs, but he succeeds on killing the evil emperor but dies as well.He is then carried out of the area by his fellow fighters and friends and his death turns him into a Colisiom star and that is why I give the gladiator a five star rating and is a breathtaking and is a must see and own movie.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is how horror movies should be done.  It is just freaky.  I mean, Michael Myers himself is scary.  I love Jamie Lee Curtis.  She is a really good actress and is amazingly great for this being her first movie.  Don't watch it with the lights off!
B00003CXCT|1.0|If you would like to see the films you grew up with, don't buy this set.  Instead, go to eBay and get the \\"faces\\" VHS box set for around thirty bucks...the \\"faces\\" boxset was the last time the original, untampered-with classic films were released on video--and it will very likely be the last time.  If you're hung up on obtaining DVD versions of these great films, then splurge for laserdisc.  Don't like the jingly little ditty at the end of Jedi special edition?  Neither do I.  Nor do I want to see Hayden replace Sebastian Shaw (the one, true Anakin, whose face remains the one Luke poors his soul out too in the feigning moments of the film, even in this new edition).  Make sense?  No, it doesn't.  Neither does the wooden acting in Clones, or Jar Jar Binks, for that matter, but that is an entirely other rant.  What's next, tweaking Hamill's seventies shag for a more updated look?  I mean really. <br /> <br />My point is, don't waste your money on a pointless rehash of an already great work--get copies of the originals while they're still on the market, and enjoy this awesome trilogy for what it is--an incredible piece of filmmaking that taught the world how to dream. <br /> <br />
B00005JL3A|5.0|Resdient evil is a movie based on a video game, which is supposed to be bad, right?  Those type of movies generally suck.  But, however, this is very good.  It is actually scary and interesting to see these characters stuck in a situation.  It's the video game live.  And, the movie nods its head to alot of the trinkets in the video game.  Milla Jovovich is very convincing, but Michelle Rodriguse (or whatever) can go somewhere.  The commentary is HYSTERICAL.  Besides the story line, the commentary is the best part of this movie.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I have to say I am quite pleased.  The songs have a good flow to each of them, no random stuff to detract.  Links 234 and Mutter and Nebel... and all of them are my favorites.... :) but those three first.  Nebel is quite interesting.  Seriously, if you are interested or if you buy the album, do yourself a favor and dig for some lyrics (in English, or whatever language you prefer).  It really brings the overall theme of the song to bear when you have an idea of what they are singing/shouting.  For instance, Mutter has the singer singing from the perspective of a child, one that either was unborn? or neglected or somesuch ill favor.  I have a copy of the lyrics, but I still am trying to figure out the meaning at the heart of each song.  Spieluhr is another good one to read up on.  The song may sound loud and energetic, but once you know what they are singing. . . . .<br /><br />So, there you have it.  A review of German industrial/rock (forgive me if I mixed up the genres, I don't listen to much music) from an American who is new to both the genre and the language.  I like it.
0920668372|5.0|When my daughter was small, I bought this book and we read it very often.  I am not really a very emotional person, but this book always brought tears to my eyes.  In fact, as my daughter grew older, she would often sing the refrain to me just to elicit some tears.  Now she is a long way away at college and struggling with some problems.  Since I can't be with her to hug her right now, I am ending my emails with the refrain.  This book will keep you connected as you both grow through the stages of your lives.  It's been years since we've read the story together, but I'll always remember \\"I'll love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\"
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is alot like baseball. If you don't like it, it's because you don't get it. Well, consider yourself lucky that you can enjoy so many many more idiotic movies (Independence Day, Waterboy, etc) and not even know the difference! <br /> <br />Sometimes it is better to keep quiet and appear stupid, than to speak and remove all doubt!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This young man is too good to be true.  Let's see, Truth is Beauty, and Beauty, Truth.  This recording is good and true. Powerful and inspiring.  Rich like fine dark chocolate.
B000002H5I|4.0|Well it took me 16 years to get this, and then to realize how incredible an album it is. Sure I heard \\"Fast Car\\" a thousand times on the radio and liked it, but nearly every other track here is at least as good. \\"Talkin' Bout A Revolution\\" is another popular song of hers, and my favorites here are \\"Across The Lines\\", \\"She's Got Her Ticket\\", \\"For My Lover\\", and the beautiful \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\". That song is amazing. As much as I like the subject matter of most of these songs, it's still not as wonderful as the music itself. I'd be suprised if her eventual \\"Best Of\\" album was overall this pleasing.
B00006LLLN|5.0|You will have to hear this recording to believe it.  Then if you still can't, get the DVD.  They sing so sweet and high, not to mention play like the devil.  Great sound and delightful choice of tunes.  Feel free to lift your spirits with this cd.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|Voyageur is clearly missing the suductive mysticalness that I have grown to love and crave about Enigma. Please bring back the subtle chants, chimes, and angelic chorus that seduces the mind and take it to far away mythical places.

Whatever happened to \\"The voice of Enigma?\\" Her voice alone melts the soul.
0790729628|5.0|Following 1979s Alien, the extremely talented director Ridley Scott made what might be the ultimate achievement in Science Fiction filmmaking. Blade Runner works on all levels and includes some mindblowing imagery of the future. The film was even further enhanced by Scott's director's cut. The DVD, however, lacks extra features and even a real title screen. A new possibly 2 disc release would be very welcome and also a long time coming. A film of this caliber deserves the best treatment.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|Don't fall for it, guys! They released a half-finished movie. I've seen many of the movies in this series and I loved them, but this one doesn't have the silhouettes of the guy and his two robots at the bottom of the screen, supplying most of the dialogue. Why did they leave them out? I assumed I was supposed to try to supply the dialogue myself, but everyone in the theater got mad when I tried it. <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I am amoung the unfortunate millions who have been subjected to this \\"trilogy\\". to think of three worse movies would take some time. at over two hours each this is more than six hours of bordem. the special effects for the year this was made were pretty impressive, but it doesn't save the poor acting, terrible script or crusty plot. i wont go on forever with this, only because i know you all have seen these awful movies, and probably agree with me, so i wont waste your time.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Let me first say that I don't own this trilogy.<br /><br />I loved the orignal 1977 film, and have been really looking forward to it's release on dvd. I didn't know that the release was only going to be the \\"special edition\\", and from the reviews here it seems it is special only to Lucas.<br /><br />I am also a fan mostly of the first film. ESB and ROTJ are also great, but Stars Wars will always remain my favorite.<br /><br />I resent the fact that not only has he altered all of the films, but that they are only being released as a boxed set.<br /><br />Why? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ That is why.<br /><br />I only wanted the first film, and not this new butchered version of it anyway, so needless to say I won't be buying this.<br /><br />I find it ironic that he whines about piracy, then he goes and does something like this.<br /><br />This will only contribute to piracy. I don't know if these films were ever available on laserdisc, but if they were, and are still around, someone is surely going to rip them and post them on the net. And there will be a lot of people who, not being able to legitimately purchase them, will be eager to download them.<br /><br />What an idiot.<br /><br />He got it right the first time. While I agree that it is his right as an artist to make changes, I think that in respect to the fans who made both him and his films a smashing success, he could have offered the original theatrical versions also.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are both so awful I wouldn't want them if they were being given away free with a large pizza or a Big Mac.<br /><br />This is Lucas's new \\"vision\\"?<br /><br />If so, then I'd say he needs to schedule a visit to the optometrist.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I'm sure that many people are pleased with the release of the Star Wars Trilogy. I am as well. However, I feel it was a mistake to release an extended version at this particular time. I think Lucas Film should have released the Classic Trilogy first, then extended version later. I was 22 when I first watched Star Wars, and every time I see the Classic version, I feel 22 again. Now I am 48, and watching the extended version, I lose that feeling and think, \\"Oh, that's new footage.\\" Or, \\"That scene with Jabba and Han looks too digital.\\" Or, \\"Why upgrade all this stuff and leave the Death Star plans as basic as a Pong game?\\" I am no longer \\"in the zone\\" of movie watching, I am distracted. So hence, the 3 stars instead of 5.  However, I am glad it is out. My kids will not know the difference, and I am resolved to watch it through THEIR eyes from this point on. If Lucas Film decides to release \\"Star Wars Classic Trilogy - Widescreen\\", he will again have access to my wallet.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This has to be the best album of they year just the sheer anticipation. Now i've listened to a couple of times and have to say that even though it's not super political (which is ok) it is very socially aware that there is something terribly wrong.   <br /> <br /> <br />     Hopefully some little redneck kids who like Green Day will listen to this album and it might make them think about the things going on in Iraq and how stupid our beloved President Gasman\\" is and what he's done.  <br /> <br />    Overall this album is amazing all the songs are awesome and i'm sorry to scare some people off but not every song on here sounds like American Idiot, there are a few that are uptempo/affressive (well as aggressive as Green Day get) , The best songs are \\"Holiday\\", \\"Blvd. of broken dreams\\",  and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". If you're a fan of Green day you should already have this if you like rock music at all you should get this. This is the 21st century London Calling.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Help, please, someone who has bought these: <br /> <br />    I can't get specific information as to whether these are re-mastered copies of the \\"Star Wars\\" I saw 30 yeras ago or the updated, CGI'ed \\"new\\" ones. This is important to me because my criteria can be summed up as follows: <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars\\": Old Space Battles Good, New CGI Jabba Han letting Greedo get the first shot off Bad (Shooting first doesn't make Han a \\"murderer\\", George; if you get the drop on Charles Manson, or anyone else who has just TOLD YOU HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU, shooting first is self-defense.) <br /> <br />\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\": Always so good it almost can't be ruined Good, New Animated matte paintings on every flat service and watering down Vader's best line in the from an Entire-Life-of-Power-Seeking-Ambition-Frustrated-and-Enraged \\"Bring my shuttle\\" to  <br />\\"Give Solo blah blah and meeet me blah Executor blah blah\\" who gives a rip? Bad. REALLY Bad. see above, and note \\"almost\\". <br /> <br />\\"Return of the Jedi\\": Old Non-stop frenetic cartoon action space combat with the same ships now moving six times faster than in \\"Star Wars\\" and H. Beam Piper \\"Fuzzy Sapiens\\" Rip-Off (oh wait, excuse me... it's an \\"homage\\") Dance Picnic Bad, New Tighter editing and a curtain call for all the planets we'd seen or heard of up to that point showing celebrations of the fall of the Emperor  and, of course, the death of the Rule of Law, but what the hell, you can't have everything, right?, but MOST OF ALL the elimination of the above-mentioned cynical marketing ploy monkey-dance Good. <br /> <br />    Yes, I did actually admit that at least in the case of the upgraded \\"Return of the Jedi\\", the new version was better than the original. See? I'm not completely intractable. And hey, I also think the new \\"Sabrina\\" is far better than the old one, too, and I'm a huge fan of Bogart, Hepburn and Holden. <br /> <br />    Anyway, let me know if these are what I fear, because hooking up my laserdisc playerto the plasma screen TV so I can watch the digitally re-mastered original series versions I own on laserdiscs is like trying to run a fighter jet with coal. <br /> <br />    But it will be worth it. <br /> <br />Don \\"Pegging-the-Geek-O-Meter\\" Hawthorne
B00008YJH5|5.0|This came out in 1988 and even today it would be considered groundbreaking. No band since or before has mixed pop, punk ,flamenco and some avant-garde stuff so perfectly. I don't even think anyone has really tried. Even if they have they never matched the pixies energy. Every song is awesome and interesting. Gigantic is just superb and made me fall in love with Kim Deals.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I have to admit; I absolutely loved this one. This movie is nothing deep, but very entertaining. To me, a good movie has to be either deep, touching, or pure fun. This movie is simply pure fun to watch. Uma is certainly the best actress for this role. I can't think of any other Hollywood actress that would be half as good as her. She is absolutely marvelous. The way she handles the sword is so cool, and professional as well. My favorite scene is the combat between Uma and Lucy in the courtyard. The Japanese winter view, the landscape, and the beautiful snowfall already grabbed my attention, let along the stunning music. The fighting took place under such peaceful surroundings. Everything was fascinating.  <br />Again, this movie may not make you think, but it's a gorgeous movie to watch.  I can't wait to watch the second volume, and don't understand why I waited so long to watch the first one.  <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Green Day have come back a lot more mature and interesting than i have ever seen them before. The band has really come full circle, this album seems more like Warning but pumped full of steriods. Warning was a highly political/social album that didn't get a lot of fanfare because it strayed too far away from the Green Day \\"formula\\" even Billie Joe said that Warning lacked some of the energy that they have had in previous efforts, this album does not lack an energy. This album comes back to green day of old for some instances but then takes off into different direction. There are some very touching songs that really show the maturing these guys have done. The lyrics are very well done and aside from a few songs like the title track, rock n' roll girlfriend, and St. Jimmy most of the songs change tempos and stay interesting. The best song is probably \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Blvd. of broken dreams\\". Just an amazing album by a band that can do no harm.
B0000797IO|3.0|Jennifer Anniston leads a carefully constructed yet deadening life as Justine in \\"The Good Girl\\".  In one of those dead-end Texas towns (which I suspect exist largely on backlots in Hollywood) Justine works a dead-end job at a local department store, is married to a dead-end shlub (the latest in a long line of amiable, moron-losers played by John C. Reilly) and has nothing to look forward to.  Bubba seems incapable of having that same perspective - largely because he spends most of his free time smoking pot with his best friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson - late of \\"Holes\\" and \\"Minority Report\\").  Justine is that critical age, when people who had thought themselves young adults realize that middle-age is in sight, and they've got nothing to show for it.  The world that had seemed a candy store to her when she was young, now looks like death row - bereft of possibilities.  Things change with the arrival of Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) a wide-eyed young dreamer who hates his life, but has ideas for changing things.  Holden is a dreamer who patterns his life on \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and the sense that he was meant for bigger things than their town allows.  Sensing Justine's wanting spirit, Holden fixates on her, spurring feelings Justine as well.  Much of the \\"Good Girl\\" follows Justine's dilemma - stick with her hated existence, or take a chance on a reconstructed one with Holden.  Though soon realizing that Holden's sense of imagination means trouble, the dilemma only deepens, and Justine only pines harder for a new life that's increasingly unattainable.  Never making a final decision, Justine verges in one direction, then the other - spurning, then giving into Holden.  Unfortunately, Justine will also learn the consequences that her new relationship will have, and how the tottering of her carefully-balanced life affects the delicate illusions of life for those around her - Holden, her husband and even Bubba. <br /> <br />\\"The Good Girl\\" veers between being a dark comedy anda serious character study - sort of like \\"In the Bedroom\\" with gallows humor.  The script pokes relentless fun at the small-town Texas characters (a compulsively fundamentalist security guard, a goth co-worker, and her dead-pan boss) but remains weighted down by Justine's abject life.  At its worst, \\"Girl\\" is also infected by the same annoyingly arch and flighty personality that drives Holden - but our lives aren't as bleak as Justine's, so we're not as easily fooled, and we're left with a script that tries to be much smarter than any of its players.  It's almost as if Holden wrote it.  If \\"Girl\\" does succeed it's because the leads put more soul into their characters than the script does - with kudos to Reilly and Nelson.  If Bubba and Justine's husband aren't exactly sympathetic characters, they are characters who manage to inject some surprise into their predictable roles.  In short, this isn't a flick for a light-night at home, but it's one you won't soon forget.
B000001IQH|4.0|The way these guys looks probably scare the Simple PLan/New Found Glory kids away but their songs which are very heavily Clash inspired songs. All the songs are very good even though i would rather have Let's go or Life Won't wait. Too bad Rancid kind of sucks now.
B00005JNEI|5.0|First of all, there's a lot of good reviews from people who know what they're talking about and actually watched the movie. If you agree or not with the item being reviewed, it's your choice. Everyone has the freedom to have a point of view about this subject. <br /> <br />However there are lots of reviewers bashing Michael Moore's movie with phrases full of prejudice and anger like \\"he's gay\\", \\"fat\\", ugly\\", \\"morbidly obese\\" and saying he's \\"brainwashing the youth's minds\\". Is this the land of free or the land of the prejudice? I'm sorry to say that but I'm disgusted by your oppinions to say someone is brainwashing my weak mind. But guess what, you don't know me. Wow, just because many people enjoyed this movie and are starting to think about politics and how they affect the world (hmm did you guys forget that you're not alone in this world?), they are wrong and you are right. And this was only from the few posts I've read. Even \\"third reich\\" was quoted. Unbelievable! <br /> <br />Heck, there's even a guy who says, after writing a somewhat long post that he didn't watch it. So what does it show? I bet many haven't watched it either. So what if Michael Moore is popular? It doesn't mean he has to be a nice guy. <br /> <br />What about \\"anti-American propagandha\\"? Man, this sucks, huh? But what about the pro-american propagandha in most Hollywood's war movies? Or teenagers movie, showing the whole world how to dress, how to behave, how to wear? So what if this is an anti-American movie (although I doubt it is)? American propagandha is everywhere. So before you talk about such relevant matters here: <br /> <br />1) Watch the movie <br />2) Think about the WHOLE WORLD IMPACT and not only about your internal politics. There's something wrong with this picture. <br />3) By using prejudice every phrase just proves you're mediocre and Michael Moore maybe should do a movie about you and people like you. Who knows? <br /> <br />This review was only directed to the other reviews not the movie, I'm sorry but I felt it was necessary to express myself. And it doesn't matter where you live, you know that USA's decisions have a major impact over the whole world. Thank you for your time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is Green Day at their finest.  Absolute finest - sooo much respect for everything, the diverse music to the whole concept to the contraversial title.  They went soooo much farther than any band in recent memory to come up with a bold record that stands out.  I had the whole album downloaded, but its just one of those records that I had to own.  Too many way too many outstanding tracks to mention, but my current fav is the final one, WHATSERNAME.  Not a bad one though, what an accomplishment.  Oh and for the two onestar reviews I saw,please please PLEAAAAASE PLEAAAAAAAAAASE disreguard those, as one was just a conservative guy who obviously just didnt like the title of the CD.  And the other was some meaningless joke.  Believe me, even if you don't agree with them, the music is top-notch.  And if you do agree with their politics, it makes it even sweeter.  BY FAR THE BEST RECORD IN RECENT YEARS!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always been a Greenday fan, and really enjoy their live show, but wasn't expecting a lot from this album after hearing the decent, but over-produced and generic first single, \\"American Idiot.\\" After buying the CD, I skipped the first track and was sucked into the ever-changing melodies of \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\" Wow! What a change for Greenday! Obviously taking a page from Pink Floyd, the first six (ten if you count all of the parts of Jesus of Suburbia) or so tracks in this album just flow together one after another and it's refreshing to hear the band try something new and pull it off so well!! I enjoyed the last album, \\"Warning,\\" more than most people, however it definetly had it's faults--it was obviously from a band in transition of styles, no real clear direction, and I think that \\"American Idiot\\" is a much more solid effort on the bands part. It's much more complete and has a very distinct flow to it. \\"American Idiot\\" is a very well thought-out album and is an enjoyable and rewarding listen. Greenday is the only pop-punk band that I've ever really like, they've always had something about them that puts them above the other \\"bands\\" of thier genre, and I'm not sure exactly what it is, but the album, \\"American Idiot\\" has it in groves! 4.5/5 Stars! I'll give it five stars just to counter the idiots giving it one, because they disagree with some of the lyrical content and rating the album based on just the first single. Remember folks--music is an expression of emotion, and you don't neccisarly have to agree with the lyrical content to enjoy the melodies and the emotion driving the songs.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Here it is 2 yrs. after its release & I am still lovin this  <br />CD.  40 yrs. from now I will love this cd.  She was involved in the writing & prducing of 95% of this CD & she has proven that she is the real thing.  I own 100's of CD's all in different musical genres & Stripped by far is at the top of my list.  Christina has it all....showmanship, intelect, & a voice that soars to the Heavens.  She is a gem & every song on this CD is outstanding.  I love the variety of R&B, pop, rock, ballads....& I looooove the new duet with Nelly \\"Tilt Ya Head\\".  I am so anxiously awaiting & cannot wait until her upcoming album.  Love her....
0446530891|2.0|The fiendishly clever and unbelievably intricate master plan of the villain makes no sense and requires a thousand quirky circumstances to converge even to make it creak to the finish line; the supposedly superior law-enforcement characters make the same mistakes over and over and over and over again; no one seems to be motivated by any detectable purpose; the ending seems to take forever. There are huge hunks of expository dialogue where characters recap everything that's happened so far and what it all might mean. This reads like a book written by committee from a plot outline by Rube Goldberg. <br /> <br />It did want me to buy Sean King's house, though. ;)
B00003CXCT|5.0|I cannot believe that these movies are on DVD.  The special effects are incredible.  I cannot wait for the final version when the have all 6 Episodes cleaned up to Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith(ROTS) standards.  When the special effects finally complement, as in add to, (not compliment) the brilliant actors of the day.  I will be so intrigued, that I will devote an entire week to watching the movies 1-6.  After all, they are all on movie broken up in to small segments.  I cannot wait for them to return to theaters in 2007 (educated guess because it is the 30th anniversary of the saga on screen, 2006 will be the 30th anniversary for the book versions) .  They will be able to show episodes one through six with ROTS special effects one right after another, which is what they tried to do in 1997.  (Which was the first time I had ever seen a Star Wars film in the theaters, it was amazing).  I am 20 now so I do not remember the original releases because I was not yet born.  And being in the science field.  I want a story to make sense.  So, when I see episodes one through six  I do not have to worry about the fact that Jango Fetts unaltered clone Boba would have a different voice, logically that does not make sense they are identical twins in every way except age and environment.  Temuera Morrison is the new Boba(clone), because he was Jango(genetic template).  And it looks that the the Stormtroopers are in fact clones of Jango as well which is what we found out in Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones(ATOC).  However, they did not mess with their voices, yet.  I just think that they are waiting for the release of ROTS to see for certain that the Stormtroopers and the Clonetroopers are in fact one and the same.  This is truely the best work of art of all time.  I just cannot get enough of it.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I've been waiting a long, long time for a movie like this. A long, LONG, time. But finally my prayers have been answered. Is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow the steam-punk, retro-futuristic, CGI-candy, dream-come-true that everyone has been hoping and wishing for? All that and a box of everlasting-gobstoppers.<br /><br />The first thing that people will notice about this film is it's eye-popping visuals. Anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing Mamoru Oshii's film Avalon will be familiar with the style. It's hard to describe exactly, but you'll know it when you see it. Everything has a soft focus, and a noir-ish black and a cool retro, almost black-and-white-but-not-quite tint. Some will say this is to cover up the CGI and blue screens. Personally I think it's to create a cool visual effect. Not that there aren't CGI and blue screens...<br /><br />This film has got to have more CGI than any other film in history. That's because EVERYTHING is computer-generated, from the cities, to the skies, to the giant mechanical monsters. Normally I hate CGI usage in films (like in Spiderman or Star Wars), but in this film the CGI is not an effect. It is the entire film. As such it isn't part of the movie so much as it permeates it. It doesn't look fake because the entire film is like an incredible dream you might have if you remembered every cool Hollywood film you grew up with as a kid. And speaking of cool Hollywood films...<br /><br />This movie is super-charged with the same spirit of adventure that made everything from the Adventures of Robin Hood and Captain Blood to Star Wars and Indiana Jones the great films that they are. Watching Sky Captain maneuver his plane through the city streets is exhilarating in the same way that an X-Wing fighter was the first time we saw it head down the Deathstar trench. Don't get the wrong idea, however. This movie in no way feels like it's stealing from great films of the past. Rather, it is a fresh creation born from the spirit, ideals, and idealism of its forerunners (and there's no such thing as an original idea anyway, or at least that's what Isaac Asimov said). The best way I can convey what this film is about is to remind you of movies like The Fifth Element and anime series like The Big O and Giant Robo. These combined old ideas in a new way, sharing the spirit of yesteryear with a whole new generation.<br /><br />Some complain that there isn't much in the way of plot to be found in this picture, and perhaps they are right. I could describe the story of the first Star Wars film in one sentence. I could describe the Prisoner of Zenda in a few more. In other words, good adventure films often HAVE NO PLOT! That's their trademark, really (anyone remember Kurosawa's classic The Hidden Fortress?)<br /><br />Although the action sequences are glorious, and the visuals are breath-taking (going from the aforetomentioned Noir style in the beginning to a mind-blowing explosion of color towards the end), no movie can truly be great without appealing characters and a story that holds your attention. Now I've never been a big fan of Angelina Jolie or Gwyneth Paltrow, but I've always loved Jude Law. That said, I feel that everyone who was in this film gave a great performance, nailing the character they were playing perfectly. Sky Captain is a total Errol Flynn type character and his essence is captured perfectly by Jude Law. Polly Perkins is a wonderful Lios Lane type played wonderfully by Gwyneth Paltrow. And it's a good thing Angelina Jolie is in so little of the movie because she pretty much steals the show with her wonderful portrayal of Frankie Cook.<br /><br />The musical score of this movie harkens back to the good-old-days of Hollywood, much as do the finest scores of John Williams and James Horner. For what it's worth I loved the musical score, watching all the way through the end credits of the film (and Jane Monheit's mesmerizing new version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\").<br /><br />Somepeople like their movies to be realistic. Some people don't like old movies. Some people hate anime, can't stand classic film scores, and don't like cartoons. This movie is not for them. This movie is for the kids who grew up with classic sci-fi and adventure movies, teen-agers who love comic books, and all those who long for the Hollywood days of yesteryear. For what it's worth, I think this is the best film of the year. If more films like this are on the way, it will indeed be a grand and glorious tomorrow!don't like old movies.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Why o why, MUST YOU INSIST ON SCREWING UP OUR FAVORITE CHILDHOOD MOVIES. Granted, alot of the extra crap is appropriate, not too much or little new CGI, but still, WILL YOU JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL DAM VERSION ALREADY???<br /><br />I'm telling you people, there will be at least 3 or 4 releases, then an Aliens \\"Quadrilogy\\" style release (maybe) in 2050. Hopefully I will live to see it. It is so obvious how effing greedy they are, especially when the first \\"new\\" movie was so graciously released on VHS only (for over a year), well into the DVD-age. (...) I''m keeping my crappy TAPES. Thanks.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|As a musicologist, I come across a huge range of music, and a huge range of talent, but I can honestly say that Peter Cincotti is one of the great jazz talents of our age, with a versatility that is even more salient in his second cd than in the first. If you're more into the old standards, Peter's self-titled first cd simply cannot be beat; plus its full of his own compositions, which are impressive even BEFORE you realize he wrote them before he turned 20. If you want to hear him swing AND lay down some unexpected funk to some pop/jazz songs you thought you knew, buy the second cd as well! Either way, you can't go wrong! Peter is a great composer and arranger and his talent is astonishing. His piano skills alone might have made him famous, but he's a double threat, with smooth vocals that convey the emotions of someone who's lived a life three times as long. He's also a fabulous and charismatic live performer! I've been to many shows already and will keep on going. So, my advice is this: Buy his cds! Go to his shows! 4 out of 4 musicologists think you'd be crazy not to.
0393035158|5.0|As I write this morning the headlines are blaring that yet another American has been beheaded in Iraq. Much like the man whom Sam Harris describes in the opening chapter of his groundbreaking book, it is \\"trivially easy - you-could almost-bet-your-life-on-it easy - to guess\\" his murderer's religion. The latest American to lose his head to a Muslim terrorist was \\"guilty\\" of many things - being in the wrong place at the wrong time, needing a job, not professing a belief in Allah - none of which is a capital offense in the rest of the world, but more than sufficient to warrant death by mutilation to those deluded into believing that the \\"Creator of the universe has written a book\\" and that this book makes it OK to kill \\"infidels.\\" The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason should be required reading for everyone who professes belief in \\"Almighty God.\\" <br /> <br />     I have never before read a book that both made me laugh out loud and terrified me. I laughed when on page 35 I read \\"The belief that certain books were written by God (who, for reasons difficult to fathom, made Shakespeare a far better writer than himself) leaves us powerless to address the most potent source of human conflict, past and present.\\" I was terrified when on page 224 I read,  \\"Imagine what it would be like for our descendants to experience the fall of civilization. Imagine failures of reasonableness so total that our largest bombs finally fall upon our largest cities in defense of our religious differences.\\" In between, Sam Harris has the courage to point out that the like the Emperor in the fable, our religious beliefs have no clothes. More frightening, this naked delusion that people call \\"Faith\\" is responsible for evil on a scale that is breath taking and heart breaking.  <br /> <br />     As a woman, I have special reason to fear all forms of fundamentalism. All fundamentalists segregate women and severely punish any expression of female sexuality outside whatever form of marriage they sanction. This is not surprising. As Wilhelm Reich pointed out many years ago in works such as The Sexual Revolution, The Mass Psychology of Fascism and The Invasion of Compulsory Sex Morality the warping of sexuality produces emotionally crippled, frightened people who will tolerate the tyranny of their leaders, be they religious or secular. But if we do not shake off our illusions about faith, and encourage a healthy sexuality in our children, it is unlikely the human race will survive. <br /> <br />     If you care about the future of the world, run, don't walk, to your computer or nearest bookstore and buy this book. <br />

B00005JLXE|4.0|This is a really great time to be a fan of Daredevil. There's Daredevil the movie, many of the great Daredevil comics are available in nice reprints, and Amazon is now taking pre-orders for the Daredevil director's cut. Elektra the movie is on it's way too. I'm excited about all these things. After enjoying Daredevil the movie I can't wait for more Jen as Elektra action.  Speaking of Elektra, the negative reviews that critique her name and claim the film is a bad adaptation of the comic have me perplexed. Elektra's name in the comic is the same as in the movie so they adapted that correctly. If it's good enough for Frank Miller it's okay by me. If they had changed her name for the movie picky people would have still complained.   Jen is cute when she's funny so let's back off attacking the humor in this movie too. It's a comic book movie. Cheese is part of that recipe. It always will be and if you hate cheesy comic book stuff you must be having a coronary over Sky Captain.  I've got no reason to gripe about Daredevil. This is a cool DVD, the director's cut should be even better, and Elektra is on the way!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I havent bought the album yet, but I have downloaded nine of the songs, and they are amazing. This album goes above and beyond what I have come to expect from Green Day. They no longer do short little songs that go by so quickly. Many say this is a bad thing, but I think the increased length and musical complexity creates a much more enjoyable album. Musically, I have heard a great improvement in all three band member's playing. Tre Cool's drumming is more clear smooth then ever, Billie Joe's guitar explores new realms, and Mike's bass creates the perfect background for all the songs. Overall, I give this album five stars. This is definately their best album yet, and their most mature, but every song still carries with it peices of the old Green Day we have come to love so much.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I've been emailing them like crazy to release this cut and my prayers have been answered! By the way, this is not coming out the same week as Spiderman 2 as one review states nor does it only include a few audio differences. This cut includes several minutes of scenes not included in the theatrical release. FANTASTIC!
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|This was worth the wait.  From the copy of the original lp's lyric sheet to the Vanilla tapes to the making of docs, this package has it all.  Disc 1 holds the original album---It's great.  What else to say?  Disc 2 holds the Vanilla tapes.  Early demos of songs from London Calling and songs that did not make the cut.  The versions here of I'm Not Down,  Guns of Brixton and Death or Glory along with Dylan's Man in Me make this set a must have.  The dvd included has a geat short about the making of London Calling along with videos and some studio glimpses. <br /> <br />BUY THIS!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day finally did it!! Back in 1994 when I was in sixth grade I was introduced to a little album called Dookie and it changed my life. Then Insomniac came out and I was floored. Even more amazing and diverse was Nimrod. The acoustic-punk of Warning blew me away. It's been four long years but it has been worth the wait. The genius that Billie Joe Armstrong has been inching towards for more than a decade now comes to fruition with American Idiot. Every song is pure genius. American Idiot, the first single, seems all too relevant to too many people. Holiday is a scathing commentary on the war in Iraq. This album contains some of the best Green Day songs ever including: Boulevard of Broken Dreams, She's A Rebel, Letterbomb, Wake Me Up When September Ends and the nine-minute Jesus of Suburbia. I especially like part two titled \\"City of the Damned.\\" All too often there is a song that comes along that \\"matters.\\" I'm here to tell you that this will be one of the few albums this year that matters. You owe it to yourself to buy this cd born of songwriting genius.
0385336810|5.0|As a reader of the Shopaholic series, I had to buy this book as soon as it came out.  Emma is somewhat like Becky, but the story is very different.  Imagine telling a perfect stranger all your little (and not so little) secrets.  No problem - they don't know you and you'll never see them again - right?  Wrong - they enter your life in a big way and the fun begins.  Worse - Emma has trouble remembering exactly what secrets she has given away!  This book is a light read - great for those of us that want a fun book to laugh with.  There are some ups and downs, but overall this books joins the author's Shopaholic series as a fun read with a happy ending!
B00003CXCT|4.0|The wait has been worth it.  After years of interminable patience, the original Star Wars trilogy at last makes it to the modern technology of DVD.  All three films are spectacular in sound and visuals-particularly the Dolby EX soundtrack.<br /><br />The digital transfer is clear and concise, to the point where some compositing of the motion control spacecraft cells show up a bit too clearly.  It does seem that the Lucasfilm technicians cleaned up most of the shots, but a few got missed.  Oh well-a minor quibble.<br /><br />All three films are magnificent, but my favorite, \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" was the most impressive.  The incredible asteroid chase measures up to ANY modern digital effects sequence, and the DVD treatment only makes it better.  The final \\"I am your father!\\" scene is a masterpiece in digital format; every detail is crystal clear.  At last, there is commentary by director Irving Kershner (who provides some fascinating insights), Lucas, and sound man Ben Burtt.  Disappointingly, the only actor on this disc is Carrie Fisher (I did not do commentary tracks on the other two discs, and so can't comment on those).<br /><br />There are some areas where \\"memory dating\\" takes place: the cheap-looking plastic suits the Imperial Storm Troopers wore, for instance.  Of course, this has nothing to do with the trilogy coming to DVD.  It is just a sign of the more than two decades that have passed since these films were released.  DVD only highlights the passing of time by making the movies sharper.<br /><br />I sincerely hope movie goers of all ages see this spectacular updating of the classic film trilogy of all time.  It is finally in the format it should be seen in!  Watch it again...and again... and again!
0385335482|5.0|I bought this book at an airport and couldn't put it down.  Becky Bloomwood is a young woman that never met a sale she didn't like!  Needless to say, this leads to an overstuffed apartment and an ever mounting pile of bills!  How do you deal with debt - well, you just hide your bills in a drawer or under the bed (you get the idea) and just don't think about them!  This might work for awhile, but Becky finds out that creditors can be very persistant and bank personnel rarely increase credit lines when debt gets out of control!  Things do get better, but I won't tell you more as this book is a must read!  Sit back, relax and prepare to laugh!

B00003CXCT|3.0|According to thedigitalbits.com, viewers have been reporting at least one technical glitch on \\"A New Hope\\".  One of Tarkin's lines is rather garbled, apparently.  Additionally, it has been noted that the surround channels are reversed for at least some of the film, and the trumpet fanfare when the rebels attack the Death Star is buried in the mix.Lucasfilm has issued a statement denying any snafus and that any changes in the audio are intentional.  The problem with Tarkin's speech (asking which planet should he choose) would belie this though.
B0000013GT|5.0|This will not appeal to you if all you like is 50 Cent and Nelly.<br />Okay... This album is my favourite CD everrrrr(tied with OutKast's Aquemini).  This CD is stellar from start to finish.  I can't find a single thing that hurts the rating.  There are NO interludes.  In any CD if there are intuerludes at all, I like them to attach it to a song, or add more tracks.  I hate when a CD has so little songs becasue of interludes.  Anyway...  The beats are still some of my favourites today.  The lyrics mesmerize you and make you think.  The flows, in my opinion, can't be beat.<BR>I love all of the tracks.  Two Dope Boys (In a Cadillac), that is one of the hypest beats ever.  ATLiens is byfar the catchiest chorus I've ever heard.  Good beat and lyrics to go with it.  Wheelz of Steel, like some have said before, has some amazing scratching, flow and beat.  Yes even though Jazzy Belle is a lower key song, it is soooooo good.  Dont skip it just because you mind find it slow.  Oh yeah, theres some scratching in there too.  Elevators is an amazing lyrical feat from both Big Boi and Dre.  It has an amazing beat.  If you play that in your car, people will hear that wicked echo of the snare from so far man.  Ova da woods.  Daaaamn the bassline in that beat kicks it up a notch.  Babylon is a tight song that has some lyrics i love but cant sample here (explicit).  Wailin is a little short but has a really good flow and that a kickin beat.  Mainstream in my opinion is a great song, but is the not the best song in the Album.  Its a great song, but the rest out-level by half a step.  Ohhh my Goshhh.  Decatur Psalm is so amazing.  Everything is good about this track, i dont know what to say.  Millenium is my favourite track on the whole album.  Dre just tears the whole place apart in the very first verse.  The chorus is the best chorus I've ever heard and I would love to hear that live.  Extra-Terrestrial has good lyrics and flow.  Don't let the beat turn you off.  It's not a trunk thumpin' beat but it sounds really good.  13th Floor/Growing Old is a really good song.  It has a good piano style beat.  It is the slowest song on the album, but ond't let that fool you.  You get some really good lyrics in there.  The last track is a remix of Elevators.  I find that the beat is better than the original.  Some amazing scrathing here.  Same great lyrics, just a new beat.
0767817478|1.0|Please don't pain yourself to watch this movie.  I like Broderick, but man, what a crappy movie.  I can't believe this movie was even called Godzilla.  Anyone who knew the original Godzilla will NOT like this movie if they are expecting classic Godzilla.  It's not the CG which is bad it's how Godzilla looks, acts, etc.  Where are the enemy monsters too anyway??? <br />Absolutely dissapointing from start to finish.  At least he sounded like Godzilla.
6304510861|4.0|David Lynch writes and directs this very bizarre and weird look at whatever it was that this movie was pointing out. I myself am a Lynch fan and I think this isnt his best work but it sure makes your head throb trying to think about what the hell is going on. It's intoxicating and you cant leave the room. You gotta watch the whole thing and just go wow, that didnt make any sense but it was awesome. All I got was that Bill Pullman is a saxaphone player who thinks his wife is cheating on him and he gets these videotapes and one part looks like he kills his wife, played by Patricia Arquette so he is sent to prison and that he goes into the mind of Balthazar Getty, seeing threw his eyes, the secrets that unravel about his wife and he secret life and at the end where he kills Robert Loggia, Pullman is actually the kid and he kills him and then Pullman as the kid goes and tells Pullman the jazz musician that Loggia is dead and then takes off on the Lost Highway...but that is all I got and it could be totally different but that's my conclusion on it. Fascinatingly directed by Lynch. Is it just me or is this as confusing as Twin Peaks? Also starring Robert Blake looking like a mime, Richard Pryor in a wheelchair, Rocker Marilyn Manson in a small snuff film, Rocker Henry Rollins as a Prison Guard, Giovanni Ribisi as one of Getty's friends, Natasha Gregson Wagner as Getty's girlfriend, Gary Busey as Getty's father and Michael Massee as that Andy guy. A Tour De Lynch Force.
B00006LIRI|2.0|Like every U2 fan, I wonder why The Fly, Lemon, Please, Walk On and Elevation have been left behind... Oppositely to what have been said about Miss Sarajevo, I think this track is extremely moving and was a must have on this CD. But that isn't were U2 and the marketing team spoiled the CD. It's mostly on the remixes and second CD, of the Special Edition Best of.  <br /> <br />I feel that the B-Sides represent the band, in another way, as much as the singles. And, beside what U2 think, they made great b-sides in the 90s that you can't find here!!! What about \\"Two shots of happy, one shot of sad\\", that most people will never hear? What about \\"Satellite of Love\\", \\"Night and Day\\" and the remix of \\"Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses\\"? Even the \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Paint it Black\\" covers could have been put here, to see where U2 dig in the 90s... And having to suffer these horrible remixes of Numb, Lemon, Discotheque and If God Will Send his Angels is offensing the fans and any listener!And why didn't they put that live, very different and beautiful version of Sunday Bloody Sunday, sung by the Edge...  <br /> <br />As a real fan, I have the singles and the cds... I shouldn't cry about these mistakes. But I thought that these songs could finally be heard and be appreciated by a larger crowd! And I felt that this CD could have more value, could be classified as a YOU NEED THIS ALBUM IN YOUR COLLECTION. But, with this spoiled version, it's not a must. I suggest you buy the normal, one cd version of the Best of, and even then, you wouldn't have a real Best of. I hope How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb will give me shivers, forgiving this commercial mistake!!! <br /> <br />
B00000F566|2.0|Was it the long polka-dot hot pink shirt with the belt around it? Was it the leotards? Was it \\"The Time of My Life,\\" Johnny's final number? I can't remember, but at some point you remember that this isn't really the '60s. Oh, it was Baby's hair. Nobody puts her Aqua Net in the corner!<br /><br />I watched this flick for the first time ever, after having some weird compulsion that told me that everyone else in my generation had seen it. Now I know why I should have seen it when it came out - when I was in elementary school.<br /><br />Can anyone actually call this a good movie with a straight face? Now, I know I risk getting \\"unhelpful\\" votes because of my unpopular opinion, but you gotta realize that a 25-year-old man in 2004 may not have the same sort of feelings a 14-year-old girl would have in 1987.<br /><br />This movie is silly, unrealistic, and lacks any real conflict. I waited almost two hours to hear Swayze's most famous line. I was surprised that Baby was literally sitting in the corner. Maybe she likes to see everybody. I always sit in the corner in restaurants.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm giving it 2 stars for 2 reasons: 1)I respect a man who can dance without seeming a little light in his big black boots and 2)\\"Love is Strange\\" is one of the sexiest songs of the '50s.<br /><br />Biggest Laugh: Patrick Swayze mouthing \\"Owe it all to you,\\" in a very dramatic number - right in front of Baby's parents! She's grounded.<br /><br />By the way, how long were they at that camp? Was it the whole summer? Because Baby got good fast!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Who are you and what did you do with Green Day?  A year ago, I couldn't think of a band less likely to do a concept album and to pull it off.  American Idiot is a masterpiece, in every way, shape, and form.  It is a huge step up musically and lyrically for the band.  The songs weave together beautifully to tell a story that so wonderfully captures the atmosphere in the United States right now.  Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Are We the Waiting are sensational tracks coming one after another.  There are certain musical experiences that have profoundly effected me, and hearing this album for the first time is right at the top of those experiences.
B00003CXCT|5.0|George Lucas keep modifying and altering his masterpieces. I love this trilogy a lot, it's my second favorite to the Lord Of The Rings. I live in Mxico and the release date is the same as in United States, but I'm still don't know whether to buy it or simply rent it. If it's true the rumors of further altering, I won't buy it and I'll stick to my VHS copies of the original. If George Lucas keep doing this, it will be just like Michael Jackson's face, a gruesome and unrecognizable version of what once was perfect.
0312983867|3.0|More of the same, but I think this one was a walk in the park for Evanovich.  She adds a few plot devices that lack inspiration and toys with them long enough to fill the book... take Bender in already.  The lost handcuffs got tired.  The Rabbit.  And I'm glad Albert Kloughn's, Joe Pesci character got distracted from bounty hunting midway through the book.  Lula's character is good, but there only needs to be one.   <br /> <br />I'm ready for Stephanie Plum to get some skills.  I want Stephanie to get the upper hand on Abruzzi and to be a part of bringing him down.  I like that when she gets scared she walks right up to her fear and tells him to back off, but why not put some bullets in the gun and keep it handy instead of half loaded at the bottom of an overstuffed handbag.  This ending was a disappointment. <br /> <br />This series is fun enough to continue following, but I'm glad to be almost caught up so I can cut down to one book a year.  Maybe that will help keep it fun.  2.5 stars
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris book is a miracle.  Finally, we have writer who comes out and tells the truth, truth, truth at last.  The are many, many ways you can argue against having faith in the modern \\"god\\" and Harris is only one way.  Harris does a superb job.     Truth is based on public, replicable \\"Evidence\\".   There has been in thousands of years and will never in the next thousand years, ever, a religion based on scientific \\"evidence\\".   That is why it been assigned the name \\"faith\\" or blind faith.      Turn off your logic, reason, do not ask for facts, evidence, proof, etc. just have blind, dumb faith.      There is no evidence of so-called higher \\"being\\" anywhere.    There is no evidence for faith, that is why there is no many different \\"gods\\" all around the world, even within a single religion; there is disagreement across time and space.  god spelled backward is dog.      \\"god\\" is a human fiction, created by the human mind, in human language.  Witness a typo.  when \\"god\\" is spelled as:    AOD  BOD  COD  DOD  EOD   FOD  GOD  HOD  IOD  JOD  KOD  LOD  MOD  NOD  OOD   POD  QOD   ROD  SOD  TOD  UOD  VOD  WOD  XOD  YOD   ZOD      GOD Spelled with an extra O is GOOD or GOOOD or typo OD or DO.   The word \\"god\\" is fiction from human language.     GOD or COD or FOD or ZOD, exists only in human imagination, human language, in the written human language.  In the modern era, there is no evidence for faith, it is high time for humans to abolish human ignorance, and that faith in a so-called higher being is just nonsense, false, not a shred of evidence
0375707972|4.0|It has taken me three days to sit down and figure out what it is that I wanted to write about this book.  I won't begin to recap the book because many others have done it, and I think that knowing too much about this book will handicap the reader.  Go into this raw, don't read too much about it.<br /><br />This book packs an emotional punch, but it is a punch that is strangely distant, and for me it faded rather quickly.  Perhaps it is because I guessed the plots twists before they happened, but I don't think so.  I think it is because there is a difference between American and German authors.  This work was translated into English and it came across a little too distant for me. I understand the events in the book forced the author to step back, but it was too much for me.  The lack of direct emotion was strangely oft-putting to me.<br /><br />The book is moving, but it is the Chinese food kind of moving.  You will be hungry for something emotional rather quickly.  It is well written and technically sound novel, but too sanitary.
B000002KET|4.0|It pains me to give a Black Sabbath record 4 stars. But still, that is good rating. It would hard for Sabbath to top their fourth album, so instead, the band decided to take an easier approach to their music. The evil feel of Sabbath is almost gone, but the great music is still hear. The title track's awesome riff rips through your ears before you know what hit you. The rest of the song is well contructed and shows a different side of the band. On the rest of the record, the band decided to take on different sounds. Whether it be lush acoustic arrangements (Fluff), synths, (Sabbra Cadabra) or both a mixture heavy and soft music ( the opening and closing tracks, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath marks a different sound for the band. Most of the experiments are well executed, as the album holds up well as well (Though not as good as its predecessors). Yet, the album doesn't really sound like a complete Sabbath album. It's great, but the heart isn't almost there. But like I said, this is a great record and fans of the band ought to check it out. Key tracks include Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Spiral Architect and Killing yourself to live. The rest of the album ranges from great to Ok. But as a whole, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is welcome addition to your CD collection. Check it Out!
6305394776|4.0|French composer Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992) is generally regarded as one of the most important musicians of the 20th century.  Most famous as composer and pedagogue, he was also a virtuoso performer and improvisor.  It was in fact his natural gift for improvisation which led his conservatory teachers to recommend that he study the organ, which in turn led him to compose some of the most important masterpieces ever written for that instrument.<br /><br />Organist at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris for over 60 years, Messiaen constantly improvised music for services, mostly based on Gregorian chant melodies.  These improvisations often generated ideas leading to composed music, thus making the organ loft a real musical workshop.<br /><br />This DVD gives a rare glimpse into that workshop.  It includes three improvisations on the Christmas chant \\"Puer natus est nobis\\" (Unto us a boy is born), filmed in October 1985.  Each is a little program work, the first depicting the joy of the angels announcing the birth of Christ, the second the magi following the star, the last the magi presenting their gifts to Mary and Jesus.<br /><br />We hear musical elements similar to the work he was composing at the time, the Livre du Saint Sacrement for organ (which includes a Puer natus setting).  Yet we also hear milder, more conventional sounds, showing more clearly his stylistic links with other French organists, and how clearly he grew out of that tradition.<br /><br />The video provides extensive shots of Messiaen at the organ console, playing soberly yet deftly with sure, calm and efficient technique.  There are also shots of the organ case and loft, though oddly none of the rest of the church.  The sound quality is generally good -- only a few distortions with deep bass tones.<br /><br />The improvisations last c. 25 minutes.  Then follows a full-length performance of the Quartet for the End of Time, filmed in live concert at a monastery.  The performance is adequate, though somewhat flawed -- the only reason I give this DVD 4 instead of 5 stars.adequate, though somewhat flawed -- the only reason I give this DVD 4 instead of 5 stars.
B000002TPS|5.0|Megadeth. A band which never ceases to amaze me. They don't always seem to be a favorite among metal fans. Metal fans is such a loose term it doesn't matter anyway. This album is great. I have owned it for a while, however, this past week have I rediscovered it. This album just has a certain feeling. I can't put my finger on it. It is quite a depressing album, however it makes you feel good at the same time. The atmosphere is definitly there, you can tell the songs were written with some sort of feeling and passion. Although old school Megadeth fans may not like this as much as Rust in Peace or Peace Sells, you should not turn your back on it, because when you experience this album, you will never turn back. <br /> <br />Standout tracks: Addicted to Chaos, A Tout Le Monde, Youthanasia, I Thought I Knew It All.
B0002O06N0|4.0|The Akron-based duo Black Keys (not to be confused with that other white color-named duo from Detroit) serve up their latest serving of 70s influenced rock-and-blues garage sound, and this time better than ever. This album just explodes with energy!<br /><br />\\"Rubber Factory\\" (13 tracks, 41 min.) starts off with a blazing \\"When the Lights Go Out\\", and doesn't let up from there. \\"The Desparate Man\\" sounds like The Jimi Hendrix Experience revived right here in your veru own living room, as does \\"Girl Is On My Mind\\", really outstanding. \\"The Lenghts\\" is the unexpected track, a ballad of some sort (gulp?), but it works somehow. \\"Stack Shot Billy\\" and \\"Aeroplane Blues\\" are heavy blues-influenced tracks. The album closer \\"Till I Get My Way\\" sums up the album perfectly, an all-out rocker with strong guitar-feedback, wow.<br /><br />The Black Keys are coming to Cincinnati shortly, and that's a show I'm not gonna miss. I can't wait to see these guys bring the songs from \\"Rubber Factory\\" in a live setting. Obviously this album isn't gonna be big on the charts, but no matter, this is a great album. And please, play it loud!
0060589272|4.0|the 1st book i read of coelho was \\"veronika decides to die\\" as it was recommended to me and i could not put it down, read it on a flight and finished it and couldn't stop talking about it ... the next book i picked up was valkries and it was \\"ok\\" a bit preachy though ... so, i picked this up and it was addictive and enjoyable though the ending a bit far-fetched .. but, it made you think a i really enjoyed it .. 2nd to veronika, but, well worth a read
B000089RVX|3.0|I like the band, and i still enjoy some songs from this album. Some songs in here are underrated by fans, for example, i enjoy \\"Hello\\" more than the explosively popular \\"Bring me to Life.\\" \\"Haunted\\" will sound like a cross of their hit songs, and soon most songs will sound rather alike and uninteresting. I think \\"Bring Me to Life\\" caught a lot of attention because it deliverately sells out to the fanbase of contemporary punk rock (especially the like of Linkin Park), but it is in essense uninteresting and unoriginal when heard along with most of their songs. <br /> <br />The album is moreover a classic sell-out. Why else would they include \\"My Immortal\\" if not for the fact that it played in the Daredevil soundtrack and would entice people into purchasing this one as well? To correct a common misconception, it is not their first album, only their first nationally-recognized album. If you however depend on the Evanescence website and the band's sell-out attitude, this is their only album... something i take as further proof of selling out. Well \\"My Immortal\\" is an old song of theirs dating at least to their Origin (2000), that just happened to be included in the Daredevil soundtrack. But due to the soundtrack's popularity they capitalized, which is fine. It doesn't make the album any better. <br /> <br />Ultimately the album is a rather stale promotion of a solid musical style. Previous offerings from Evanescence included musically moving jewels like \\"Eternal\\" and \\"Where Will You Go?\\" (both from Origin, which i deem superior) that did not necessarily depend on angst-ridden Amy Lee and her mediocre singing voice and lyrics, but whose sounds seem merely echoed here. Would you enjoy Fallen? Certainly if you like trendy contemporary punk rock, or if you've enjoyed Amy Lee's singing in \\"My Immortal\\" or Seether's \\"Broken\\". For myself, what i believe is most redeemable from Evanescence is their often-intriguing music, which sometimes stands alone well enough.
6303313345|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in this fast-paced and humorous movie as special agent Harry Tasker, a top spy in the ultra-secret Omega Sector.  His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) has no idea about his involvement with Omega.  She believes that he is a simple computer salesman.  Tom Arnold stars as Albert Gibson, Harry's trusty sidekick. <br /> <br />Omega is on the trail of the Crimson Jihad-a terrorist organization which has acquired nuclear weapons and is threatening to blow up a different American city each week.  Tia Carrere (Juno Skinner) is a member of this organization and has captured Harry and Helen and taken them to an island in the Florida Keys.  Will Harry and Helen survive or will the terrorists prevail? <br /> <br />I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  Schwarzenegger, Curtis, Arnold, Carrere, and Chaleton Heston are excellent in their roles.  The special effects are especially well-done, with the Harrier jet raid on the bridge being one of the best special effect scenes.  But the best scene of the movie has to be Jamie Lee's sexy dance in her black underwear.  As with any Schwarzenegger film, there are plenty of one-liners to keep you laughing.  If you're a fan of action flims, then this movie is for you.  True Lies is an exhilirating mix of non-stop action and romantic comedy.  Watch and see Schwarzenegger and Curtis at their best.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I went and just bought this CD! Its okay. Nothing spectacular, but redundant, same sounding songs! <br /> <br />Best tracks: <br /> <br />American Idiot <br />Wake ME Up When September Ends <br />Jesus of Seburbia
B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory had really out done themselves with this album. This album as soon as it came out was a huge change to the thrash we had been listening to before, like lets say Metallica, and Slayer, two popular bands and with all do respect great bands too. Fear Factory may not be as skilled as Metallica as far as instruments go, however i can tell you, they are for more creative, and that shines on this album. Ministry were the ones, or if not the creators of the Industrial/Thrash Metal scene, however Fear Factory were the first to bring it to the mainstream and dare i say perfect it. When this cd hit the shelves it was very ahead of its time and a good change for thrash, blending in         <br />samples, electronics, and even Death Metal vocals.  <br /> <br />Even though they are much closer to Thrash Metal than Death Metal, they are as brutal as some Death Metal bands and can send shivers down your spine with Christians haunting bass lines, make  <br />your ears bleed Burtons vocals, and guitarist Dino can literally make your spine shatter. The electronic and sample work on here is great and very amusing. The key to their success with the electronics and sample work is that they can perfecly combine that with the instruments and they do not over do it. Think of it this way, the elctronics is just a touch of flavour for this album. Vocalist Burton is very good, he has a very rough, low voice, he's yelling is terrific and his singing is touching. Guitarist Dino is very talented, with very moving riffs, and shotgun like ones alot of the time. Drummer Raymond is a double bass freak, his drum work is fast on this album, and he is a amazing drummer and big impact on why i bought this album. Last but most definitly not least, bassist Christian has done a top-notch job on this album creating some remarkable bass lines and rhythms. <br /> <br />As far as songs go, all of them are great with the excellent opening of \\"Demanufacture\\"(listen to Raymonds double bass control) tothe ending song \\"A Therapy Of Pain\\", a slow creepy song leaving you after that stunned for a bit. Aside from the fact that all songs are good(yep you can even find me listening to \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\"), I will just discuss three of the best songs off this album. \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" is the perfect song to head bang to, if not the best, with its terrific musicianship and  <br />catchy as hell chorus. \\"Zero Signal\\" is a very, very atmospheric song which will be stuck in your head, and it is possibly one of the slowest songs on the album. \\"H-K(hunter killer)\\" is a fantastic song with a cool intro full of sample work, and then like many other songs off this album an explosion of anger and fury is released after the intro. Very cool song. <br /> <br />This album in my book is the best album you'll find in Thrash Metal, with very little flaws which I shall go over. My first and only flaw is that maybe the drummer could have added a little more creative fills on this album. By only finding one flaws this leaves me to say that overall this is the most perfect album i've ever heard in Thrash and possibly overall, and perfect is a very strong word!
B00028HBKM|3.0|THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST WAS A GOOD MOVIE NOT A GREAT OR CLASSIC MOVIES HERES WHY. FIRST MOVIE WAS VERY WELL SHOT,HAD GOOD ACTING,AND VERY GOOD DETAIL TO THE PERIOD WHEN THIS WAS TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE. NOW THE PROBLEMS FIRST THE CHARACTERS WERE VERY UNDERDEVELOPED AND THE MOVIE BECAME ILLOGICAL AT TIMES. HALF THE TIME YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO THE CHARACTERS WERE OR WHY THEY WERE THERE. FOR INSTANCE WHO WERE THE OTHER PEOPLE HANGING ON THE OTHER CROSSES AND WHY WERE THEY THERE. SATANS CHARACTER WAS ANOTHER MYSTERY HE DID NOT MAKE ANY SENCE. ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE RELIGIOUS MESSAGE WHICH THE MOVIE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE. FOR 2 HOURS WE WERE WATCHING JESUS BEING BEATEN, WHIPPED, AND TOURTURED. WE FELT SYMPATHY FOR JESUS BUT THE RELIGIOUS MESSAGE NEVER MADE IT THROUGH. MEL GIBSON WAS MORE INTERESTED IN SHOWING IN GRAPHIC DETAIL OF THE CRUCIFIXTION THAN HIS TEACHINGS. <br />BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID THE MOVIE IS UNDENIABLE WELL SHOT, GREAT ACTING, GOOD MUSIC SCORE, AND GREAT PERIOD RECREATION. THE MOVIES GOOD POINTS OUTWEIGH ITS WEAKNESSES.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has accomplished an aural masterpiece with their latest album, American Idiot. With the hoopla surrounding their newest release, I expected a disappointment, or a spectacular piece of work. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Green Day doesn't disappoint. As many have pointed out, this album is constructed as a punk-rock opera, and not a traditional medly of songs. This is significant; many of the songs build on the events and messages in previous chapters, and much of the meaning is lost if you skip over tracks. This is a CD meant to be listened to from beginning to end. Furthermore, Amazon lists this as a 21-track CD, but don't be fooled: two of the songs, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, are mini-operettas; one song broken up into several parts. <br /> <br />Officially, this album has 13 songs, as opposed to 21. <br /> <br />This is a magnificent album, with every track a strong one. I can't say too much about this album, as I'm absolutely in love with it.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I just thank God That George Lucas didnt paint the Mona Lisa, If he had his heavy hand would have repainted a smile ear to ear, put blue eyeshadow on her and had a circus and a rainbow in the back ground! <br /> <br />But really, Im all for a directors cut..however he should have included the originals ( or is he such a great salesman, that the real star wars will be available next summer for another 50 bucks :P ). <br /> <br />
0062502182|4.0|Those who are looking for another bible sort of thing, an encyclopedia of wisdoms will be disappointed no doubt. But when I look around myself in my society (in West Bengal, India) and observe the young, it seems this book can be strongly recommended. Societies, in which life's meaning and scope have assumed a terribly narrow proportion, must be reminded certain simple things time and again. What can be more important than identifying and giving shape to destiny, not that of a frustrated soul but the glimpse of which the history of civilization helps us to? To reassure one of one's right to a destiny , not that of the condemned, not that of the vanquished but as is granted to the believer is no mean achievement. This book may not be adequate for the philosopher type, may not be as detailed as a manual but definitely meaningful to the directionless majority who have started finding no other destiny except utter cynicism. Only word of note could be that unlike the initial part the issues taken up in the later parts are not that readily identifyable to the irregular reader. But, then when has narrative served the purpose of the attempt fully?
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The choice of songs helped make Love Actually my favourite theatrical release of 2003, as it added to the theme of love itself.  That being said, much of the songs can already be found on other albums, and they are a mix of soul, alternative, pop, and some old classics.  But don't mistake this for one of those NOW or Totally Hits collections.  No, this is something better.<br /><br />Leading off with a soulful Mariahesque pop ballad is Kelly Clarkson's \\"The Trouble With Love Is.\\"  I'd heard the song in the movie due to its \\"love is a many-splendoured thing\\" line and it wasn't until I bought it that I connected the name with the song.  Well, if she's this good, getting her Thankful album, where this song hails from, may be in order.  On Kelly's heels is Dido's breakthrough hit, \\"Here With Me,\\" from No Angel, whose heartfelt strings mirrored the discovery Juliet makes when she sees the wedding video Mark made.<br /><br />As for Norah Jones' mellow \\"Turn Me On\\" from her Come Away With Me done during a slow dance sequence, well, you can't go wrong with Norah.  Two other songs that tug at those strings is Eva Cassidy's cover of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours song \\"Songbird,\\" done during the sequence when Sarah and Karl are about to score in her bedroom.  But nothing beats Joni Mitchell's tear-inducing \\"Both Sides Now,\\" a song that has more import to me, as it was played by my friend Claudia to my mother during her last hours.  Here, it was played by Karen when she discovers her husband may have become unfaithful to her, and yes, it did induce tears from her.<br /><br />On the alternative side, Maroon 5 comes in with a medley of the R&B-flavoured \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" and \\"Sunday Morning,\\" both on Songs About Jane.  I'm glad the Calling's \\"Wherever You Will Go\\" is here, as it saves me from buying Camino Palmero.  The grinding guitars mixed with Alex Band's gritty yearning vocals of someone wondering who will take his place after his girl's left him definitely strikes a chord, especially as many of the characters have gone through the \\"Runaway with my heart/Runaway with my hope/Runaway with my love\\" phase.  Definitely a key song and favourite here.<br /><br />The Beach Boys' \\"God Only Knows\\" played when everybody is embracing and greeting each other at the airport finale, is included.  Why then wasn't the similar-genred Bay City Rollers' \\"Bye Bye Baby,\\" played during the funeral of Daniel's wife on this CD?  Minor quibble there.<br /><br />Hugh Grant's prime minister character did a Tom Cruise-like dance, keeping his pants on, of course, to the Pointer Sisters' classic \\"Jump (For My Love)\\" after scoring a coup against the American president at a press conference and revving up British pride.  Texas's \\"I'll See It Through\\" and the Sugababes' \\"Too Lost In You\\" round out the contemporary R&B side.<br /><br />But Craig Armstrong's bittersweet \\"Glasgow Love Theme\\" instrument is my favourite here, the piano and strings of this slow number bringing out a happy kind of sadness in me.<br /><br />The bonus songs have a distinctive Yuletide flavour to them.  Otis Reddings's rendition of the Irving Berlin-penned \\"White Christmas\\" had me in frowns, as I wondered what mayonnaise had to do with X-mas.  Then it hit me.  Mayonnaise?  He was singing \\"May your days\\" as in \\"may your days be merry and bright.\\"  Well, duh!  Bill Nighy's \\"Christmas Is All Around,\\" perks a smile given the opening sequence when he fluffs the song.  Profanities not included of course.  This version is more polished, needless to say, a mixture of rocking guitar and Yuletide strings on this Christmas version of the Troggs' \\"Love Is All Around.\\"<br /><br />David Lynden Hall, who was the wedding singer in the movie, does a decent cover of the Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love,\\" sung with its trumpet flourishes during Peter and Juliet's wedding.<br /><br />Finally, Olivia Olson, who played the cute preteen love interest Joanna opposite young Sam in the movie, does a competent and racing version of Mariah Carey's \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You.\\"  Vocally, she has shades of Aguilera in her.<br /><br />And that rounds out a multi-genre soundtrack that keeps consistent with its theme of love, with lots of talent involved.shades of Aguilera in her.    And that rounds out a multi-genre soundtrack that keeps consistent with its theme of love, with lots of talent involved.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This album is incrediable I can't stop listening to it.I hope this will be the album of the year.
0385512104|5.0|Christopher is a genius little kid well above the minimal Mensa threshold with a very capable memory, logic skills and very gifted at math.  However, Chris is also an autistic kid, very, very low on his social skills.  The combination of his skills makes him a very special kid: wildly creative, most of the time living in a fantasy world of his own; yet fragile given his unability to read other people's emotions and intentions accurately.      However, Chris is brought to reality by a bizarre incident: the dog of his neighbourg is killed and left in the garden with a fork.  As Chris approached the dog to capture the scene, the lady next door things Chris had something to do with it and calls the police.  The police quickly finds out that the little kid had nothing to do with the incident, but Chris gets deeply engagaged into the whole incident from this point on.    After this point the novel gets into a very quick, engaging turn of events as Chris discovers new traces, somehow by luck, somehow by connecting all the dots that are given to him by the adults around. Eventualy Chris gets to unmangle a web of events that are very relevant to him and his father and \\"the curious incident\\" turns into something very meaningful to him and his dad.      The novel is extremely creative and is definitively a huge breeze of fresh air.  It definitively teaches how simple developments can be used to build high quality fiction work without having to look at the clich toolbox.  Do not miss it - you wont be able to put it down.
B00028HBKM|5.0|A readers' point of view is always a determinant in the perception of any communication text. But in the case of Mel Gibson's \\"Passion,\\" the viewer's values and beliefs could be detrimental. Clearly in making of the film, Gibson was being true to his own deeply felt and held values and beliefs and therefore indisputably his \\"Passion\\" is a work of art-maybe we should add, as Tolstoy defines \\"art.\\" Gibson is sharing his profound feelings without compromising for commercial gains or appearing fair and balanced to viewers who do not share the same values and beliefs, and his honesty and commitment comes across loud, clear, and boldly. Another significant attribute of the film is that its form is closer to painting or music rather than to literature. Gibson primary focus is on the impression his film leaves on the audience rather than how the kernels in the narrative structure fit. Like a painter and composer he leads the viewer to conjure the story and its ideological themes and to realize that the depth of the message is beyond the linear chain of the events that construe the story.                 The events from the gospels depicted in the film are appropriately chosen for the effect Gibson intends. The casting is remarkable-all the actors displaying the mythical iconic look associated with their character. The flaws in the text are minor, and most likely felt because Gibson raises our expectation. Personally, I felt the pace and rhythm was uneven, as if the music here and there failed to flow harmoniously. Certain scenes move too slow and are stretched providing more where less would have enhanced the persuasive power. And I wished there was less emphasis on theatre and more on cinema, less on the composition and staging of the scenes and more on montage. However, I understand this is a film by Gibson, and I have to accept it as such. Yet, I need to state that my wish is not simply my personal idiosyncrasy, but it rises from the fact that I am a serious student of cinema.     \\"Passion\\" is a remarkable achievement. Gibson reveals he understands well that faith is a matter of belief and feelings, rather than science and logic, thus his dialectics is concerned with the universal values of Christ teachings than on the issue of His deity. As far as the issue of controversy surrounding this film, it simply makes no sense. There is no controversy here. Those who are offended by the content of the film are actually in defiance of the gospels. This is Gibson painting and singing the Gospels, accurately, truly, and with all his passion. And finally, I would like to add that I am an Assyrian and Aramaic is my mother language. Far from being a scholar, but I do speak and read the new and old Aramaic language, and still think in Aramaic. Yet, it was very difficult for me to understand the dialogue. When I was able to distinguish a word here and there, I found it heavily accented and often mispronounced.
B00009KM7U|4.0|The Postal Service had an unusual start. No, not THAT postal service, but the unique band behind one of the best albums of 2003, the indie-electronic \\"Give Up.\\" Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello exchanged tapes through the mail, sculpting the sweet, melancholy trip-hop masterpiece \\"Give Up\\".<br /><br />It starts off on strong footing with the melancholy, angelic-voiced \\"District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" with its solemn organ opener. The second song is even stronger -- the sparkling, upbeat \\"Such Great Heights,\\" an adoring love song from a guy to his on-the-road girlfriend. \\"They will see us waving/from such great heights/come down now!/they'll say/but everything looks perfect from far away...\\"<br /><br />With such a great opener, the rest of the album is almost garuanteed to be lackluster. But Gibbard and Tamborello manage to keep the quality up with the delicate \\"Sleeping In,\\" ethereal \\"Nothing Better,\\" and the dreamily majestic \\"Recycled Air\\" with its backdrop of string-like synth. \\"Give Up\\" ends on a slightly darker note with the dark, grittier \\"This Place is a Prison\\" and the fast-paced but strange \\"Brand New Colony,\\" before finishing off with the magnificently cacophonous \\"Natural Anthem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Give Up\\" was originally recorded in a rather weird way, with Gibbard and Tamborello exchanging packages with recorded CDs inside. Not your typical way of making music, and some might have scoffed at this unorthodox method. But it pays off beautifully -- the melodious poppy sound of Postal Service is absolutely intoxicating. It's a perfect mix of beats, clicks, dreamy synth and sweet vocals. Gibbard's clear voice is a little sad, and contemplative, and is backed up in some songs by Jen Wood and Jenny Lewis.<br /><br />The lyrics are beautiful, romantic and heartfelt (\\"I am finally seeing/why I was the one worth leaving...\\"), often evoking a slightly otherworldly feeling, not tied in with the world as we know it. It brings up dark cities, flying couples, gaudy apartments and places where things are sad and a little dreamy. The keyboard arrangements are shimmering, guitar riffs are steady and solid, and a cluster of other instruments (organ and horn) surface and vanish seamlessly.<br /><br />\\"Give Up\\" both satisfies a musical hunger and leaves you wanting more. Proving that innovation is NOT dead in the music biz, the Postal Service is a fantastic breath of fresh air. Dreamy, a little depressed, but uplifting and sweet.up dark cities, flying couples, gaudy apartments and places where things are sad and a little dreamy.

B0002IU988|5.0|This is the first CD that i BOUGHT with just knowing ONE song...and i like the ENTIRE ALBUM!  You guys...don't think this is Creed...don't even COMPARE it to Creed...why?  BECAUSE IT'S NOT CREED!!!  This is the FIRST Album from ALTERBRIDGE.  Take it how it is, it's awesome!  :)
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Yes, f(r)iends. Three versions (the US theatrical edit, the \\"extended\\" version and the \\"European\\" edit), plus TV and radio spots, bios, audio commentary (including one by the film's four stars), theatrical trailers and a DVD full of documentaries. Everything a Romero/Zombie fan could ask for. <br /> <br />The discs have been mastered into glorious \\"living\\" color, and the sound quality is great. <br /> <br />On of my two complaints is that some of the \\"bonus\\" features on Disc 2 don't work on my DVD player, but play perfectly on my Macintosh computer's SuperDrive (If you have a similar problem, try watching the disc on your computer if it's DVD compatable). <br /> <br />My other complaint is the unecessary additions to Roy Frumkes' otherwise excellent documentary \\"Document of the Dead\\". Roy, I saw your film at the School of Visual Arts in NYC and thought it was great. Did you HAVE to tack on all that updated material at the end of the film? I believe that a seperate update, akin to a \\"Return of Document of the Dead\\"  would have been more appropriate. <br /> <br />Still, if you are a DOTD fan, Romero worshipper, Zombie freak, or someone who drove all the way out to Monroeville, Pennsylvania just to see the shopping mall where it was filmed, this is for you. <br /> <br />Okay, just one more gripe...whatever happened to Jesse Del Gre (the actor who played the Old Priest)? <br />
0345423496|2.0|This book gets 2 stars only because I was able to finish it, not because of its content.  It does not compare to the literary quality of the first 2 books in the series.  Good science fiction should be both imaginative in its exploration of the future and intellectually stimulating in its exploration of ethical dilemmas.  This book is neither.  There was only one lame chapter toward the end of the book that dealt with the religion issue and how 31st century science had impacted it.  And what happened to Frank when he landed on Europa and was supposedly reunited with Dave after a millenia?  And Hal, the epitome and representation of evil, now a \\"good guy\\" or at least benevolent?  I agree with the other reviewers that said some things should be left to the imagination and that this book should be read only to complete the series.  By the way, someone who has been writing for as long as Clarke has should not misuse the word \\"myriad\\" as often as he does.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I bought this album, as i am a fan of greenday and thought it was just their new album. Oh, boy i was wrong. What a got was almost a rock opera about George Bush and how he fooled america. <br />I just have to say..........BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whilst I might not agree with everything that this film has to offer. It does show exactly how with careful editing and controlling sound bites you can turn anyone into a buffoon.    Of course in reality GWB does not need very much help from Mr. Moore in showing that he is a buffoon.    It is a shame that the leader of the greatest country on the planet chooses to act more for his own and his families benefit than the countries.    Mr. Moore brings this out time and time again in this \\"documetary\\".     The GOP of course says that you can not do this and get away with it.    But the GOP led media (READ FAWXE NEWZ) does it all day long, every day on thier cable networks.    This now is the way politics will be forever in this country.    I am sure our founding fathers never envisioned this kind of \\"Gutter Politics\\" when the USA came into being in 1776.    God help us all. Cause a day will come when they will give and election and almost no one will vote!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok.. guys! <br />Remember when George Lucas released the VHS in a trilogy.. <br />I had to purchase that, then he came out with the updated version. I got sucked into buying that as well... There goes over $100.00 HARD erned money. <br />Then he releases this DVD trilogy.  <br /> <br />My guess is that he will again re-lease another version... maybe with more stuff in it. <br /> <br />Then when Parts I,II,III are done..He will release part III, then... He will release 1-3 Trilogy months after. <br />Then a year down the road.. I bet he will release the Collectors set VOLUMES 1-6  \\"ALL in one boxed set...with x-tras and free this and free that... <br /> <br />By the time we Star Wars Fans have gotten the best we can get... <br />We probably would have spent about $500.00 hard erned bucks (PER HOUSEHOLD) that's Billions to George Lucas pocket.... <br /> <br />What do you guys think.... <br /> <br />It is a great movie... but do you folks think we should just wait for the COMPLETE SAGA Parts 1-6 in one colletor boxed set? <br /> <br />You decide! <br /> <br /> <br />RJ
B00003CXCT|1.0|Not only is it disgusting there is no deleted scenes, no commentaries by those that we'd care about (Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, even Carrie Fisher's is limited), these Special Edition changes are there with more more additions.  Han still does not shoot first and while its \\"faster\\" its still awkward looking (and obviously annoying).  The naboo celebration scene is new with Jar-Jar doing \\"WEEESA FREEEE!\\" and Hayden as the Jedi Spirit is wrong, plain wrong...you may think you'll get audio commentary in some of these key changes scenes...nope...you'll get Burtt talking about the sound dodging the issues.  Further...AND THIS IS MAJOR...there is are sound errors in a couple scenes of a new hope where the channel got flipped in the surrounds causing it to be muffled (e.g. Leia talking to Tarkin).  They have been compared by numberous A/V forums and they are screwed up.  Lucasfilm has gotten a high volume of complaints already, but released a statement that it was artistic creation.  Garbage.  Many people are calling for a recall.  This is unacceptable.<br /><br />Kershner and Lowry have commented on further work being done on the HD set for release on Blu-Ray/HD-DVD for 2007 (30th anniversary) and that it will have deleted scenes and a number of the \\"making of \\" documentaries that have been lost.<br /><br />Will we get the OT in its original form?  Probably never.  He changed ET with men holding walkie talkies over guns...changes THX 1138 so there will never be an original Archival release on DVD (and boldly calls it The George Lucas Director's cut, not just director's cut...like we didn't know).  The only good thing on that front is lowry worked from the source footage.<br /><br />I am truly dissapointed to say the least...the whole thing is a tease at how good it should've been...if you too are disgusted join the peitition to get the originals at OriginalTrilogy.com
B00003CXCT|5.0|As usual, you have to sift through the hoards of geeks and malcontents to realize that most of these reviews out here are foolishness. Star Wars is awesome fun, and just because Lucas took the opprotunity to expand his original works using today's technology is CERTAINLY no reason to rate them \\"1 star\\" and comment on how they \\"stink\\" and so forth. <br /> <br />This is one of the most fun, entertaining adventures ever put on film. The DVD treatments are here for us to finally enjoy the sound and picture quality we remember from the theaters.  <br /> <br />I for one find the \\"tinkering\\" Lucas has done to be fascinating. I think an artist is never truly done with his work, and \\"Star Wars\\" is one of the great masterpieces. This is surely worth every penny.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I'm not one to be terribly enthusiastic about a lot of punk music, but this CD has a somewhat harder feel, and is filled with great music.  My boyfriend gave it to me as a gift and I had never heard of them before, and I was quite skeptical.  I was blown away with tracks like 'I'm not Okay.'  I usually judge CD's on not so much the number of good songs, but lack of bad songs that you would otherwise skip over.  This Album has no skip over songs at all!
0765310015|5.0|Erikson creates a world of such rich content, that one book is insufficient to hold in all of it.  To a certain extent, many fantasy creations feel spare - the writer creates the present story, but the past is nearly absent.  Not Erikson - the ancient history which gives the book it's scope logically influences the present situation, in matters great and small.  And the characters ... ah, the characters are a pleasure to behold.  Cynical and idealistic, brave or pragmatically cowardly, they feel very much alive.  I strongly recommend this book who enjoys storytelling which draws you in deeper and deeper.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am one of those fans who loves it all. From the corny 1970's Christmas Special to the lame cop-out of Greedo shooting first in  the special edition of 'New Hope'. I can even stomach Jar Jar & Anakin in 'Phantom' and the over-dramatic dialogue in 'Clones' between Hayden and Natalie. Why? Because I simply love Star Wars!<br /><br />This DVD set is very nice. The documentaries alone make it worth  picking up. And at a reasonably affordable price for 4 DVD's,($44 or so) these versions will do for now until the next release of the trilogy arrives.<br /><br />WHAT NEXT RELEASE YOU ASK?<br /><br />The one with (in my opinion) two changes that would have made this first set PERFECT. (1) The original versions of all three films included. (2) Deleted scenes.<br /><br />Everyone knows the controversy surrounding the original versions vs. the new versions. I don't really care that much about it because I like them both (except for that Greedo thing...why, George, why?) so I won't go into that biz. However, I was really looking forward to seeing some deleted scenes from the first trilogy. They have plenty available on the dvd's of 'Phantom' and 'Clones' so I thought, naturally, they'd have them for these films as well.<br /><br />However, aside from a plethora of never-before-seen footage in the documentaries which was interesting in it's own, no luck.<br /><br />I wanted whole deleted scenes. Cutting room floor type stuff. For example, ever since I was a kid, I noticed the difference in the openings of the 'Star Wars: New Hope' script, novel and comic book to the actual theatrical release. There's a scene where Luke see's the opening battle through his electrobinoculars while on Tatooine and then races to Anchorhead to report his findings and runs into Biggs. I have this scene and others like it as stills on bubble gum cards so I know they must exsist somewhere. Not to mention the various other shots taken out of 'Empire' and 'Jedi' I've been dying to see since I was 12. Well, now I'm 33 and a little let down. But hopefull. I'd love a section of organized deleted scenes and commentary on them. That would make the 'circle complete' for this die-hard fan.<br /><br />Looking at how well this trilogy's release has been put together and it's incredible attention to detail, makes me almost certain that Lucas will heed the cries of the millions of fans about the original versions and one day release them on dvd too. When that day comes, maybe I'll get my deleted scenes and a PERFECT collection. Overall I love these films and look forward to 'Revenge of the Sith' next summmer.<br /><br />Also, don't forget to check out the hidden easter eggs in this trilogy's release at [...]<br /><br />for some outakes and bloopers..

B000002MG1|5.0|Pretty much the other prior reviewers have said everything that i've agreed with. Some wonderfully done songs in this album, some well known songs such as Everybody Hurts, Man on the Moon, Nightswimming and Try not to Breath. But what really brings out the finess of this album is the sweet harmony of the instruments with the lyrics.<br /><br />A great CD for anyone looking for music to chill too, this is it. REM at their best.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Well, it's been a very long time for AP fans to wait. Is this album worth it? Hardcore fans will love this album. For the most part, AP has kept up with the times. David Gilmour is a pleasant surprise, and a very welcome addition. They could have left track two in the \\"better not use it\\" file. The instrumentals are worth the price, but the vocals are lukewarm, at best. Add this to your collection, if only because the instrumentals are great!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Every time these movies have been re-released they have increased in quality and content.  This is the world created by George Lucas, and though you guys may have a distant childhood memory he has the original concept that you based your pre-teen imagination's on.   <br />Lucas is the cause of entertainment evolution.  No one has ever erected a statue for a critic... and as history has proven, SW critics claimed that the movie (that you love) was useless and a waste of $10mil. (a bandwagon that you seem to have a comfortable seat, based on collections of other Amazon reviews) <br />Without Mr. Lucas's \\"Force\\"full push for a better copy and the newest technology available we would still be watching old grainy reruns of All in the Family and listening to Edith cackle instead of \\"the Amazon critics\\". <br /> <br />Buy the DVD's, enjoy the content and shut up!
0812548094|4.0|I'm less than halfway through the book, and already I want to choke the editor for leaving out commas, periods, and closing quotation marks all over the place.  It is driving me insane!!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Not the original releases we all know, but these films do look great. They should say SE or something on the set but they don't. I'd be much happier had they not put the young Anakin at the end(my biggest beef with this set and it still would have meshed with the new ones had they just left it alone). That being said these are worth owning. I have heard from inside sources that the original dvds WILL be released(about a year, maybe two) after the Episode III dvd and full 6 dvd set comes out. This trilogy also looks much better than 97 se edition. So what it comes down to is, keep buying all   the sets that come out and you will be happy.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This CD is one of the best from Red Hot Chili Peppers with several hit songs included. Songs like Around The World, Savior, Road Trippin' and Porcelain show the talent of the band in its entirety. Of course the only reason I did not give it 5 points was that it had too many songs from past albums on it.<br /><br />I like listening to RHCP, they've become a favourite of mine with great songs like Scar Tissue, Otherside and Parallel Universe. The track Californication is a one hell of a nice song as well.<br /><br />The album is a strong, vivid listening experience that I recommend for anybody.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I have just edited my review that I made of this album when it first came out.  It won't let me change it from 3 stars to 4.5.  I would.  I was wrong in my initial feelings on the album.  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is possibly the greatest song Green Day has ever written.  Other highlights are \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" \\"Give Me Novacaine,\\" and \\"Whatsername.\\"  I didn't expect what I was getting into with this album.  It took some time to grow on me.  It's still not as controversial as the media made it sound.  There are a couple jabs at the President here and there but nothing very direct and obvious.  It's not about that.  It's a solid rock offering that will easily be the high water mark of Green Day's career.
B000002KK2|5.0|Wow, it's hard to believe that this album was done in the late 70's because it sounds like it could have been recorded day before yesterday.  A great combination of soul, sultry ballads and even child-like songs of innocence and even some light jazz. I just can't say enough good things about this album.  I don't believe Rickie Lee has done a better album than this one.  Some words more talked rather than being sung and you feel and believe every word.  This album will stir many emotions within and has done so for me since I bought it years back.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|Another overwhelming performance by one of the great ones. It must be a real challenge to work with Mr. Hopkins without developing an inferiority complex. He just takes over everything with such a force. <br /> <br />Thad said, every actor performs brilliantly. No weaknesses detected. <br /> <br />So, I liked the film, it was inspiring, enlightening, awesome. <br /> <br />The thing I did not like? To see useless cigarette smoking in the movie. This type of thing should be criticized over and over. Mr. Hopkins does not smoke, but the two female leads do so. It does not fit. It's instrusive and superflous and serves only as unnecessary advertisement for the tobacco cartel which should be banned from this planet.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't know what to say about this CD, other than it is fantastic. I enjoy it more than Room on Fire(which also a great CD) You already know whether you like the strokes and if you do then don't hesitate. buy this album, go to the shows and sing along. I am ecstatic that rock is back and in a big way. groups like Interpol, Hot Hot Heat, The Strokes, The Libertines, Muse and Franz Ferdinand have renewed my faith. So sitback and enjoy what is going on in music. Don't be left behind. Oh yeah this is a Great CD! Enjoy!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Powerful, gut wrenching look at the last day of Jesus life before his death.  The violence, save for 2 scenes is not as bad as the hype has said.  If yu can take saving private ryan or somehting of that ilk, you can take this.  Like i said there are 2 20 minute sequences that lived up the the violence hype, but it was not 2 and a half hours of blood splattering.  The movie itself is a fine piece of cinema, and Gibson, despite my reservations, has made a fine movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was very pleased to see that this new DVD set is the Extended version including the scenes added in the 90's with new special effects.  Some of the purists on this site maintain that this was a poor decision and want 70's special effects???!??  That makes no sense, this is not the 70's and for the most part, effects in that decade were terrible!  If you can have much better effects than stop-motion has to offer these days, I am all for it!  Plus I have seen all 3 movies in the theatre when I was young, all 3 again when they came out on VHS, and again in the theatre when the extended versions came out.  I enjoyed them every single time, after all, what is not to like? <br /> <br />So really, who cares if Greedo shot first?  I don't!  And since George Lukas dictated what would be in this DVD set, he is the best possible person to render that opinion.  He made the originals and the extended movies, so if he prefers the Extended versions, that is just fine by me.  I'll buy them!  This is the greatest trilogy every released, there really is no comparison to any other franchise (well maybe Lord of the Rings...).  The Alien movies are extremely well done but Star Wars ushered in a new era of sci-fi movies, and I don't think the Alien movies would have seen the success they saw without them.  Peter Jackson certainly credits the Star Wars trilogy for allowing him to make his absolutely incredible Lord of the Rings trilogy in the extras within the DVD set. <br /> <br />I was hoping when I first heard about this Trilogy (Lukas had once said that it would NEVER appear on DVD), that they would contain the extended version.  For the films I really like, I always buy the Extended Versions if they exist.  The more, the merrier.  Just like the Extended versions of the Lord of the Rings, I want the experience to last as long as possible.  The purist argument won't sway me in the least.  Well done Lukas! <br /> <br />R.
B000148KK2|5.0|I have several of Diana's cd's but this is by and large the best one yet.  I love track 3, it stops everything, I just have to stop everything and listen to it. <br /> <br />I play this cd all the time in my restaurant and customers always ask me \\"who is this and where can I get it.\\" <br /> <br />I tell them it is Diana and you can get it on amazon.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas' street appeal has never been deniable, and that is his heart on every album he has ever made, from Illmatic, to Stillmatic, to God's Son. Illmatic was released again for its 10th anniversary, and never having owned the album, I bought it. Saying that this is one of the best hip-hop albums ever is a lie. It IS the best hip-hop album ever! Know why? Nas keeps it real for the streets. He doesn't use fancy production, he isn't flashy, and he has a limited vocab but a big heart for rapping. Illmatic has street written all over it. You can FEEL the streets of New York sweep over you as you listen to this album, and the experience is unmatched. Nas has always competed with Jay-Z for king of NYC, except on this album. While I listen to Jay-Z a lot more, and like him better, he doesn't have a heart quite like Nas does. Jay-Z is at his heart, a gentleman, obsessed with cars, girls, and cash by the bags. Nas isn't. He's authentic. I'm not saying Jay-Z is fake, but Nas only cares about rap, and sending messages straight from the projects. Listen to this album for a definition of what rap is. It will send a rush through you unlike any other. And with only 10 tracks, every one is a classic. The best rap album ever. period. <br />Bonus Cuts: They are very good, but they should be saved for another album. Definitely draw away the classic feel from the original Illmatic album. Still worth a listen. *If you already own the original Illmatic, there is little to no point in getting the anniversary edition.
B000268QB2|5.0|Hmm well I'm not sure about the comparison to Freddy Mercury someone else did, I don't hear that but what I do hear is a brilliant album that almost doesn't dispoint on any level. <br />There is some repeatativenes..but not too badly. For me this reminds me of the best of Alan Parson Project with a touch of ELO...something soft but powerful.And while folks younger than I may say Alan who? and ELO what? Since I do not listen to Coldplay or some of the other bands mentioned in the reviews I felt I would share my thoughts as an older listener who is enjoying these gentlemans style and music very very much from the first time I heard \\"Somwhere only we know\\" on the radio. <br />
B000028U0Y|5.0|This was the first Cash CD I ever bought, and a good thing, too. This is an excellent recording of a truly memorable concert...brilliant Americana with a frightening edge to it...note all the ambient prison sounds (clanging doors, PA announcements) left in. When Cash sings \\"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die,\\" this convict audience cheers! Unforgettable.
0743454529|5.0|I could not put down this book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a sibling or children.  My Sister's Keeper is a well written novel.  Great book to read for anyone that's in a book club.
6304806434|4.0|Nicolas Cage,(Cameron Poe) - fresh from deep south elocution lessons drawls out as he watches a Classic Corvette being towed behind an airplane several hundred feet up. Cage plays the nice guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, and goes to prison after inadvertently killing someone harrassing his wife in a brawl. The judge decides that Cage, as an ex Ranger should know better than to use his considerable fighting skills on worthless drunks and sends him away. During his prison term his daughter is born, whom he refuses to let visit, but collects ALL of her pictures and letters whilst incarcerated. He also beefs up, grows his hair long, and acquires a stack of white vests, to help show off his physique. Remember what I said about wrong place wrong time? well sure enough, after getting parole he is being transported on a prison aircraft for a ride home, when the plane is seized (through a planned and elaborate hijack) by the other inmates, among them John Malkovich as the criminally revered Cyrus \\"the Virus\\" Grissom. Of course, the plane is packed with the worst criminals imaginable (including a darkley comic cameo from Steve Buscemi) from across the whole country, we assume all going to some maximum security country club somewhere. I don't want to be harsh about this pure escapist way way over the top action, but it's a lot of fun, and feasible (if highly unlikely) for the most part. John Cusack is excellent as the \\"sensible\\" US Marshal on the ground, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek TNG) plays his complete opposite \\"lets kill em all\\" DEA Agent, trying to get the plane and cargo back. There's enough explosions, chases, and fights to keep most fans of this sort of thing happy for weeks, and the acting is actually very good and believable all round. The main problems are the Director seemingly not knowing when to end the movie (after several finale opportunities), and a lack of any real depth or character development (but then consider the type of movie for a second). The \\"never leave a man behind\\" code that Cage's character constantly bombards the audience with is also a little too cliched for my taste, but all that said, it IS a good picture. Predictable? Yes - but well worth the viewing, and the DVD polish adds a little. Enjoy.\\"never leave a man behind\\" code that Cage's character constantly bombards the audience with is also a little too cliched for my taste, but all that said, it IS a good picture. Predictable?

B00003CXCT|2.0|Although some of the extras make this DVD tempting, I still want to see the original editions of these movies - saving this edition for rental only. For someone who was against colorizing movies, it's ironic that Lucas chose to change these movies again. Why couldn't he simply do what Speilberg did with ET - both old and new editions in the DVD set?  <br /> <br />For people who may not understand the complaint, imagine if someone went back and added CGI effects to the original Flash Gordon serials. Those bad special effects had a certain appeal to the fans and any \\"enhancement\\" would ruin the experience. We want to see 1977-1982 movies with special effects that reflect that time period. It simply doesn't look right when you mix an old movie with new effects. It becomes obvious that the movies and effects are not from the same decade. Lucas could have easily followed Robert Wise's approach to Star Trek: The Motion Picture - Director's Edition. Wise demanded that the CGI look like 1979 effects. Lucas could have made the new creatures look like stop motion creatures.  <br /> <br />There is no way I could recommend this edition of the movies to anyone because of what I've stated above. Some of the extras may be nice for true fans. Empire of Dreams is a good documentary. However, I will stick to my old LaserDiscs for now. (I already own two different sets of the original trilogy.)
B00003CXCT|5.0|One warning: THESE MOVIES ARE VERY LOUD. The THX is mesmerizing but the soundtrack is loud especially if you have surround which my husband and I do. The pictures are clear and crisp, and the transfer to DVD was better than i expected. But, Lucas has the technology to do whatever he wants. We finally have these 3 classic films on disc and in a cool carrying box. Excellent work Lucasfilm and Skywalker Sound!
B00003CXCT|4.0|So let me begin by saying that I was nervous about the release of this Special Edition. The reviews have been so polarized regarding the release of these updated movies, that I was concerned that Lucas had blown it. I was pleased, after my initial viewing of \\"A New Hope\\", that he had not. <br /> <br />I was the generation that grew up with Star Wars. I made my father take me to see EP IV 8 times. So this adding footage thing didn't sit well with me. However, in watching this film, with it's updates and restored picture... I understand what Lucas is doing. Thirty years later, he is continuing his store with EPI, II and III. This is him going back and \\"adjusting\\" for continuity issues (both in the story and from a visual story standpoint) so that the story is consistent. These changes really do help to draw the first three movies into the new set of movies. If you are able to abandon your clutch on what these movies were, and look at the Star Wars saga as it stands today, this all ties together much better than if the movies had been left alone, and will be a launch-pad for the next three movies, if he is in fact going to do them. <br /> <br />There has been footage added and adjustments made since the 1997 release of the Movie, and I am pleased to say they are much better than THAT debacle ( I DID oppose the additions in '97, not because they we're additions, but because the we're really lousy in production value). The changes made in 1997 are still there, but have been improved and feel much more integrated into the newly restored film, which, by the way, looks amazing! So now, this classic movie has a major face lift and some new pieces parts... so what, it is still Star Wars. The story, characters and events haven't changed, or if they have, they've changed for the better in my opinion. <br /> <br />Picture quality is, as I said great. In fact the only reason I don't give this set a 5-STAR rating is because I feel like Lucas wasn't as thorough in his restoration process as he should have been. Being the king of the Lucas Ranch and all that prevails there, these DVDs should have been the benchmark that all heretofore DVDs should be measured by... they are not. They ARE great, but there are some consistency issues and obvious oversights that just simply should not have been (for instance leaving the key blocks around some of the space ships or inconsistencies in color from scene to scene.) Nothing that breaks the movie, but to a detail-oriented person like myself, it seems like a glaring omission. None the less, the film looks pristine and gorgeous and NOT like it had been shot 30 years ago. Also, as I indicated, the restoration of the film helps greatly in the integration of the new sections, they don't have the \\"glaring\\" contrast that they had in '97... it all feels seamless. <br /> <br />In terms of Audio, again GREAT, dynamic 6.1 separation. But again, they miss the 5-star mark for some glaring oversights in the remix. Sudden drops in the soundtrack, the occasional muddled voice track due to a sound effect... things that Skywalker Sound simply should not have happening. That being said, again very critical and doesn't detract from the overall experience too badly. <br /> <br />In terms of extras, I have not gotten to them yet. However, I understand that the bonus DVD feature, \\"Empire of Dreams\\"- the making of the Star Wars saga, is reason enough to own the box set. It's the most comprehensive documentation of the making of to date. <br /> <br />Bottom line, this is a successful DVD launch of these movies. Of course, you KNOW they will be re-released with when EP III comes out on DVD as a 6 part DVD collection, and perhaps for that version they will fix some of these things and maybe even offer the original releases of the movies on alternate DVDs. For now, I am very happy to have these on DVD and in the excellent shape that they are in. And I am also pleased that I can play Ep V next to Ep II and feel like they are part ofthe same story, rather than the glaring 30 year gap that would otherwise be there.
B0002STNQ2|3.0|A repeated theme in Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\" goes something like this: \\"Things never turn out the way you think they will.\\" I find myself wishing that this were true of the novel itself. \\"Prey\\" is a novel that only Michael Crichton could have written, and that comes with both the good and the bad.<br /><br />Crichton's plot, timing, and his ability to keep a story clipping along at a brisk pace are all in evidence here. Michael Crichton books are sometimes better than others, but he rarely fails to entertain or to keep the reader engaged while they are reading. His book are usually fast reads because of this, but they also exhibit that Crichton researches his subjects well, and incorporates that background material into the story without sacrificing the pacing of it. \\"Prey\\" is par for the course by these standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also par for the course in other ways as well. The characters are thin at best, the themes are ones we've seen before in Crichton's work (most obviously in \\"Jurassic Park\\"), and the ending is weak. The book also suffers from a rather poor development about halfway through -- it's something I shouldn't give away (even though it's telegraphed pretty obviously early on), but suffice it to say that Crichton had the opportunity for a really frightening antagonist in \\"Prey,\\" but sold that potential short in a rather unbelieveable way, and made for a rather bland conflict in the end. Again, all things we've seen before from Michael Crichton.<br /><br />Crichton likes to write about new technology trends, and in \\"Prey\\" he turns his attention to nanotechnology. More specifically, self-evolving artificially-intelligent nanotechnology which (of course) breaks free of its creators and threatens life as we know it. If it sounds familiar, that's because it is -- \\"Prey\\" is basically \\"Jurassic Park\\" warmed over, the same themes in a slightly more modern package. The dangers of science unchecked, the corporate world and the scientific one make poor bedfellows, human ingenuity can often outsmart itself, and so on. Yes, very familiar indeed... which I wouldn't have minded if these themes were expressed in a better book.<br /><br />\\"Prey\\" is a fair book. It's entertaining but light. The pacing is good but the characters are only crudely drawn. Its potential exceeds its execution. If we must compare it to other Crichton books (and in this case, I think such comparisons are inevitable), then \\"Jurassic Park\\" is a better book: more suspenseful and a more honest expression of the same themes.<br /><br />Read \\"Prey\\" for some light brain candy if you wish, but don't expect much more than that.one make poor bedfellows, human ingenuity can often outsmart itself, and so on.

B0002OERI0|4.0|Yea to Green Day, I bought this album the day it came out. I didn't like it at first, but after a couple listens, I really started to appreciate the songs a lot more. This cd takes a couple listens to like. This is one of those albums that grows on you. The more you listen, the more you like it.Only a couple songs on here that I really don't like. Sure it's a little different than what you'd expect from Green Day, but that doesn't make it bad. I like it a lot better than Warning, which dissapointed me. 4.5 outta 5 stars.
B0002DB52M|4.0|This film is actually presented as a play with chalkboard homes and an entire invisible town created on a soundstage but it is still an indispensable look into the psyche of humanity. <br /> <br />The town of Dogville exists during the depression era and is nestled deep into the Rocky Mountains, away from prying eyes and the influence of \\"civil\\" society. It is here that we meet Grace (Nicole Kidman) a mysterious woman who stumbles into town looking for acceptance. The moral influence of the town is Tom (Paul Bettany) and it is in him that Grace seeks refuge. The townspeople are presented with a dilemma to harbor a so-called fugitive or to take pity on a woman running from a fearful past. At first the people shun this mysterious woman but soon find her handy at chores and useful to some extent. As with all human nature Grace is soon exploited because she is weak and at the mercy of the strong, her services used and trodden upon and soon the beginnings of destruction stand firmly in Dogville. The ending is justice and vindication based on the need of all humanity for revenge and a violent end to an unfair situation. <br /> <br />This film is intriguing in its message and theory on what exists in the heart of man. Directed brilliantly by Lars von Trier it all seems strange at first until the truth is somehow brought into play. Nicole Kidman is phenomenal as the mysterious woman who becomes the town stepping stone at the sake of her true character. Paul Bettany is perfect as the town philosopher who steers the sleepy inconspicuous town into trouble. The townspeople are played with precision by such great actors as Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazzara along with many other talented individuals. This film is something original and profound with an ability to strike a cord with any society. The story is narrated by John Hurt and the writing is visionary and powerful. <br /> <br />If you like films that make you think this one will do it. In this movie you may find bits and piecesof your worst self as well. It isn't a light hearted look at a small town but rather a study on how man literally becomes as uncivilized as a pack of dogs given the right prey.    <br />
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Here's another film, like Isao Takahata's \\"Grave of the Fireflies,\\" that proves that animation can cover important topics and stories that could seemingly only be done justic through live-action.   <br /> <br />\\"Tokyo Godfathers\\" is the story of three homeless people (Hana, Gin, and Miyuki) who discover a baby in a dumpster the day before Christmas.  The rest of the film is spent trying to discover the parents of the baby.  Along the way, through a complicated series of events, they each learn about one another and themselves.  Each character is given his (or her) chance to develop and tell their story, and each is given a chance to redeem themselves. <br /> <br />The animation is beautiful, perfectly capturing the loneliness of the homeless during the holidays.  The dialogue between the three main characters seems natural, and the Japanese voice actors are excellent.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the mixture of comedy and drama is a bit uneven, perhaps the story and characters can be a bit - bizarre and improbable, but in the end, it doesn't really matter.  Heart-warming and poignant, a wonderful film.  Highly recommended.
B0002ADY24|5.0|Firefly is the first album of the short lived (unforunately) John Lawton era. This album is right up there with their classics of the early 70's. John Lawton is just below David Bryon as far as vocal talent and much better than any of his successors. He's more blusier than Byron,but doesn't have the range.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for the heavy side of the band, this album is not it. The material on this album is closer to the laid back tracks that dominate \\"The Magician Birthday\\". This album features more keyvboard dominated songs than guitar oriented songs. <br /> <br />Breakdown review of the tracks.  <br /> <br />1. The Hanging Tree - UH returns to the fantasy theme on their earlier albums with this one. Nice guitar echo effects at the songs introduction.  <br /> <br />2. Been Gone Too Long - Start out slow and then speeds up, though not too loud. Fits Lawton perfectly.  <br /> <br />3. Who Needs Me. - A Southern rock boogie style song. Songwritter Ken Hensley would leave Heep for Southern rockers a few year later. His interest in Southern fried rock seems to show early here.  <br /> <br />4. Wise Man - The Wizard, part II. Nice piano ballad that continues the theme of the Wizard on Demon and Wizards.  <br /> <br />5. Do You Know - The weakest track on the album. A throw away.  <br /> <br />6. Rollin On - Could easily be mistaken for a Paul Rogers' Bad Company ballad. Good song though.  <br /> <br />7. Sympathy - Nice mid temple rocker.  <br /> <br />8. Firefly - One of the best epic UH has ever done. Song by organist/guitarist Ken Hensley. Nice soft keyboards and accoustic guitars. Has a Crosby, Still, & Nash feel to it.  <br /> <br />9. Crimes of Passion - Another song with a Bad Company feel to it.  <br /> <br />10 A Far Better Way - This is a bonus track that should have made it on the original album. A soft ballad that sounds like it's was song by Ken Hensley (Doesn't sound like Lawton's gritty voice). Could have been an Elton John song. This song is a little different than the 1997 remaster version. There are a little more guitars featured in the 2004 deluxe remaster. <br /> <br />Also featured in the 2004 remaster are two previously unleased songs. Unlike any of the above songs, these are not album ready and are rough around the edges. You can still here scratches on these. <br /> <br />They are. <br /> <br />I Always Knew - Heep tries to do a Stevie Wonder type song on this. Very soulful. Wouldn't have sounded bad once it was cleaned up. <br /> <br />Dance Dance Dance - Heep attempting to do Disco Disco Disco. Could have fit on the Fallen Angel album along side What you say. <br /> <br />There is also a live version of Who Needs Me that is much different than the album version. <br />
B0001CCXZW|3.0|This show is amazing, the relationship between the mother and daughter is one only for tv obviously.  I think this would be every mother and daughters dream relationship.  I enjoyed watching the shows beginning, seeing how it all started.  i have been catching episodes on and off for a few years, never really getting too involved, though i have to say from what i've seen of this coming season Rory isn't taking a good turn.  My biggest complaint with this set is the lack of extra features.  There are NO commentary's at all, and very few behind the scenes stuff.  The quality is great, some due to the fact that there are 6 disks.  This quiet little town draws you into their world, and you'll love being there!
B0002TKFRM|5.0|I am a H U G E fan of the RCA Living Stereo Series. I had all the CD's (I wish I had the LP's) of the series, beginning with the 1993 discs through the releases remastered with the 20 bit UV22 Super CD encoding and the Weiss 24/96 technologies. I also have had the JVC XRCD's that have been released featuring RCA Living Stereo recordings. I mention this merely to establish credibility.<br /><br />The clarity on this Reiner \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" is staggering (and I am just talking about the CD layer of this hybrid for now! I'll get into the SACD layer a bit later.) I did A/B comparisons with the JVC XRCD2 and the CD layer of this recording and was surprised at what I did not hear on the JVC, which costs a cool $30 per disc. The JVC XRCD2 is more veiled and does not give you the spaciousness that the CD Layer gives you. As a weird example of the new clarity afforded by this new remastering, on Track 7 - Bydlo, the tenor tuba player playing the theme takes breaths between each phrase; sometimes it's a long breath, at other times it's a short gasp. On the JVC XRCD, you can barely hear it.<br /><br />The bass drum used liberally throughout the recording is revealed like it has never been on any of the aforementioned recordings. This drum has real weight and impact; its reverberations in the hall are evident and the drum head itself has tone, texture and flex. I was truly shocked that this much sound information had been missing from this recording on CD until now. It's no wonder the LP version is so highly sought after and prized.<br /><br />Throughout the entire disc, reasons to purchase this Hybrid SACD emerge: the wondrous sheen of the strings, the fantastic accuracy of the woodwind tones, the brashness of the brass instruments, the indescribable majesty of the final \\"The Great Gate at Kiev\\", etc. I can't list them all here but I can assure you that there is no other digital recording of Reiner's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" that more completely reveals his genius, the beauty of this work, the virtuosity of the players of the 1957 Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the exquisite acoustics of the Hall in which they played.<br /><br />With regard to the SACD layer, I don't know how a recording can sound more real in the digital domain, unless you were there in the Hall and, of course, at that point it's all analog. Some key SACD points: Wide and deep, accurately rendered soundstage. Stable, pinpoint placement of the players of the orchestra. Excellent timbre and dynamics. Without a hint of the digital etch that plagues CD's. This recording is truly brought to life using DSD. SACD is as close to reality as you're going to get using a 5 inch piece of plastic and this recording proves it!<br /><br />The engineers at Soundmirror, the Boston studio that remastered this SACD from the original master tape to DSD, have done a SUPERB job with Reiner's \\"Pictures at an Exhibition.\\" This new RCA Living Stereo Hybrid SACD is superior in every way to the cr'me-de-la-cr'me JVC XRCD2 which, except for the analog version on LP, was the be all and end all for the digital rendition of this recording.s, the beauty of this work, the virtuosity of the players of the 1957 Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the exquisite acoustics of the Hall in which they played.<br /><br />With regard to the SACD layer, I don't know how a recording can sound more real in the digital domain, unless you were there in the Hall and, of course, at that point it's all analog.

B00005JLR1|1.0|Like \\"Sword in the Stone\\",\\"Great Mouse detective' and \\" Atlantis\\",this movie is a real dud.It's barely faithful to the classic \\"Treasure Island\\",and the characters are dull and uninspired.Skip this dud and watch \\"Muppet Treasure Island\\" instead.
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|I have read dozens of reviews of this album and dont really understand why so many (about half I'd say) are so damn critical of it!  First, this is a LIVE album.  If you were expecting exact renditions of his studio tracks, you are listening to the wrong musician.  Lou NEVER performs songs live as they appear on his albums.<br /><br />Secondly, I hear complaints about the crappy band behind him or Lou's tendency to completely ignore them.  This criticism is WAY off the mark.  This band (named The Everyman Band) was arguably the greatest band that ever played behind solo Lou.  His live shows were jazz-inspired and his band was made up of jazz-influenced musicians.  Listen to the band lie low, playing quietly behind a ranting Lou, and then suddenly explode as Lou hits the chorus.  They dont stumble, they don't stutter...they know exactly when to play.  Besides, this CD contains the best take of Street Hassle I have ever heard.<br /><br />The remastering job is more of a \\"repackaging,\\" so dont expect crystal clarity.  You better hook up the old turntable for that to happen.<br /><br />All in all, I gave this 4 outta 5.  If you are looking for more of Lou's 1978 stint at the Bottom Line, there are a number of bootlegs out there that will satisfy your thirst:  \\"Small Club in NYC\\" and \\"The Compilation Tapes\\" are the best among them.
B00003CXCT|4.0|In the documentary Chewy speaks in the Death Star launch bay scene yapping about the \\"crazy old man\\". It's the only scene in which this is shown.    If you have an X-BOX drop in DVD 4 (bonus materials) and you can play the AWESOME first level of BATTLEFRONT. It is on Endor with the Ewoks, Imperial Walkers and Stormtroopers.    I've always felt that the games should reflect the atmosphere of the films...They've done it.    Kudos LucasArts.
B00000K2SC|3.0|What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  There are over three thousand comments at IMDb and another twenty-nine hundred at Amazon.  There even seems to be some block \\"reviewing\\" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, \\"The One,\\" \\"Trinity,\\" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc.  I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well.  Note that Gloria Foster is \\"Oracle\\" (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is \\"Mr. Reagan\\" (a little secular allusion here).  The band of heroes are also referred to as \\"freedom fighters\\" to recall our ex-prez's words.  (But never mind.)<br /><br />The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many.  Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye.  The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.<br /><br />But is the movie any good?<br /><br />Well, it's not much on video.  The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat.  The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.<br /><br />But I mean philosophically speaking?<br /><br />I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) \\"Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer.\\"  Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking.  The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18.  Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings.  Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.<br /><br />So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?<br /><br />Actually I do.  I just don't think it's original.  I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old.  And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998).  Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.<br /><br />Isn't that stretching it a bit?<br /><br />Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like \\"The Perm-Machine.\\"  Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures.  But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.<br /><br />What about the acting?<br /><br />Forget the acting.  It was okay.  Consider this instead: we are going to become software.  There isn't going to be any \\"warfare\\" between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant.  Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred.  And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!<br /><br />The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present.  Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all.  Some people call this the \\"singularity\\" factor.  The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.all this the \\"singularity\\" factor.  The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I hv waited for this DVD ever since i first bought my first DVD player a while ago.I am a typical Star Wars fan who has seen the movies soo many times and still gets a trill at seing them again.I just can't wait to play this DVD in my HDTV and DTS system, i even hv the original soundtrack in vinyl.The wait is over, finally.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|back 'n the day slipknot was a just a joke in the metal community.    with ross robinson's trademark sloppy lo-fi production, down tuned guitars, and aluminum foil snare snaps, nu-metal trademarks, no one could take them seriously (and for good reason).  and with the gimmick of 9 members, it sounded like they only recorded 4 guys in the studio. their first two albums were turds, cashing in on what korn had done several years before. then rick rubin (aka god, the messiah, omnicient genius) steps in the door and rewrites the whole metal book.  throwing in his trademark multi-vocal mixing and overdubs, he's pretty much turned corey taylor into the mike patton of metal.  the things he does vocally (the nameless, anyone?) are nothing short of astounding (which i highly doubt he can recreate in a live setting).  the guitars are a wall of sound, and joey's kit is deafening. not a weak track on the entire cd.  oh yeah, and it has melody ! (gasp). and the slower songs are some the best i've heard any rock/metal/emo-core band do...period.  the fact of the matter is that this is the hardest most intense record they've ever done, and simultaneously the softest most vulnerable album they've done.  corey's lyrics are more introspective, and an outward reflection of empowerment, rather than ressurrecting the tired formula of a traumatic childhood (staind, anyone?).  even his vocal delivery has changed, moving away from the jack daniels  soaked growl, to a dry throated declaration of power.  rick rubin said his goal was to change people's and critic's opinions of the band and what they could do, and he's succeeded with aplomb (has he ever not?). and when trent reznor listened to \\"the blister exists\\", his only response was \\"dude, i feel like a p***y now, i've gotta go lie down\\". my sentiments, as well.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day seemed on the decline after their 2000 album Warning. Admit it, even you die hard green day fans felt it creeping in. However, Billy Joe and company have managed to silence the critics. <br /> <br />American Idiot delivers. Plain and simple. It's not groundbreaking, but its a good step towards a possibly great follow up album. Their first single \\"American Idiot\\" is more simple than their previous attempts. The video definately does the song justice. <br /> <br />The long intertwined songs of track 2 and 12 are extremely intriguing. The tempo changes are excellent, and original. The chords are different, the tempos are done well, and there's definately an essence of classic Green Day in St. Jimmy. Stand out tracks include American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy, and a few of the different titled tracks in Jesus of Suburbia. <br /> <br />Solid effort, great songs, great melodies, and a larger dose of punk than you'd expect. 4 stars.
B0002QXAD6|4.0|This album is Nightwish's latest and i have mixed feelings about it.. <br /> <br />The album starts off with Dark Chest of Wonders which is a very good song then comes I wish i had an angel which is good but has a touch of techno i don't like. After that comes the best song in this album (and one of the best ever) NEMO! Beauty in all its terms. Planet hell comes afterward which is a nice song with a very operatic start. Then Creek Mary's Blood which is kinda like a script for a movie. Siren then comes which is very oriental, i like it. Dead gardens is also good. Romanticide is weird,its all scrambled, i dont like it that much. Ghost love score is great but its 10 min long. Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan is nice but its in finnish. Higher than hope is a beautiful ending to this album. <br /> <br />My favourites off this album, Dark Chest Of Wonders, Nemo, Planet Hell, Siren, Dead Gardens and Higher Than Hope. <br /> <br />This is a good album, on par with century child tho a bit better. <br />Take note that this album gives a very bad first impression and that you have to listen to it two to three times to apreciate it fully.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is GREAT!!!! Bout time!!!!  <br /> <br />My only problem with this Box Set is Greedo fired first, and that bugs me to all end. For those of you whom don't know what I am talking about, I`ll make it shot and sweet. In the original Theatrical release and the first VHS set as well as the Laser Disk releases, in A New Hope Episode, IV, in the renegade biker bar after Han talks to Obi-Wan and Luke about transporting them, Han proceeds to talk to Greedo (Jaba's assassin) about his debt to Jaba. Greedo says \\"If your lucky he'll (Jaba) just take your ship\\", to witch Han say's \\"Over my dead body\\". This whole time Han is readying his sidearm. Greedo say's \\"that is the idea\\". Han than shoots and kills Greedo, in cold blood, because Han is a pirate, and he is a bad guy. Later in A New Hope it's the same cold Han he just sides with the Federation for the greater good, he reforms his ways. In the Gold Edition and now on the DVD, same situation with Han and Greedo, after Greedo says \\"that's the idea\\" Han said \\"I'd like to see that happen\\", however this time Greedo shoots first misses and Han fires as he did in the original and kills Greedo. My problem is that by doing that Mr. Lucas turned Han from the cold blooded killer that a space pirate is, to a self defender. It should have stayed as Han killing Greedo, and had the Greedo shooting first scene in bonus features in an alternate scene section.  <br /> I gave this 5 Stars, because that is the highest rating amazon.com offers, but there is no numeric star value to give this set, I guess infinity is a sufficient star value, if it was a report card A+ would be the rating, and so on and so on.  <br />
B0002IQAD6|5.0|I can say without doubt that this is the best debut ever.  It is crammed with hits, every song deserves to be a 5-star.  Stop reading this and go out and BUY IT NOW! <br />Highlights:     Big Poppa, Juicy, and Everyday strugle
B0000C1733|4.0|All of their greatest hits on one CD.I have listened to them over the years and am a huge fan and knew one day that they would bring out a greatest hits and I wasn't disappointed.Was a little sad not to see \\"Zepher Song\\" on there but I got that song anyway:)
B000286S8S|5.0|I'm sick of people saying how much better Roth is than Hagar. Roth ain't comin back. Did you reviewers who are Roth fanatics even see him on the Sam and Dave tour. HE SUCKED!!! Half of the people were sitting down halfway thru the show. Sammy's got a better voice, better presence, better songwriting, and better outlook on the biz. Not to mention he made VH a better band. Sorry, Dave may have been good in the past, but he's the ultimate has been now, and VH would have to be desperate to ask him back, after two attempts that Dave screwed up. Oh, yeah, the CD's good. The new Sammy tracks kick!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Why do so many people who are are protesting this \\"Original Trilogy\\" give it more than one star? <br />Why is this not labeled as \\"Special Edition\\" if Lucas is not trying to conceal that fact? <br />Why is Lucas unwilling to present the true originals in their unaltered form when they made him so rich and famous? <br />Why do we have to accept these terrible versions of such perfect classic films? <br />Why do I even have to ask these questions? <br /> <br />Thanks a lot, George! Thanks a lot!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Sorry folks. Releasing the versions like this is the EQUIVALENT of Paul McCartney going back and re-recording the Beatles albums with all the modern technology. That would be interesting and maybe even cool. However, it would TOTALLY BLOW if the *new* versions were the ONLY versions available on CD.  DOESN'T THIS SOUND RIDICULOUS? I will never buy these and instead, give in to piracy. In fact, stuff like this makes me hope that piracy is the END of Lucas.
B00001U0E1|5.0|.  Shakespeare in Love is truly a comedy for the ages.    This outstanding film is much more than the sum of its very impressive parts.    Each of the cast may, justifiably, consider their work here as among the finest of their careers.    The direction is deft and smart and the staging and settings are nothing short of brilliant.    Likewise the cinematography is lush, stunning and elegant in the extreme.    Tom Stoppard's script is crisp and intelligent and is infested with clever Shakespearean references.      In its telling, Shakespeare in Love is sheer delight!    This fictional tale of young Will's romance with the beautiful Viola, set against a backdrop of the writing and premier of Romeo and Juliet, draws us in from its opening witticisms.    The characterisation is rich and warm - which further serves to engage us deeply in the unfolding narrative.    In a film jam-packed with magnificent performances, keep an eye out for Geoffrey Rush as the blundering Mr. Henslowe.    Simply superlative!    It's probably unfair to single out one star in such a luminous galaxy - all here are in fantastic form.    FIVE STARS for this wonderful, warm and witty film.
0385335482|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I've ever read- and I read alot! Sophie is such a great storyteller.  Everyone that enjoys shopping will relate to this character. I've read all of Sophie's books and this one is the best.
B00003CXCT|1.0|What a tragedy these DVDs are. We finally get them and he tinkers yet again. Lucas clearly has obsessive compulsive disorder and these movies are proof. He can't leave well enough alone. Furthermore, he refuses to at least do the decent thing and release ONE version for those of us who'd like to see the originals.
B0000029DD|5.0|This album is absolutely exquisite! Buckley's voice is spirtually resonating. His is truly one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. His music is passionate and I found myself haunted by it even after listening to it. This album is essential and has the power to transform.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Flat out the best album of the year.  Green Day is gutsy and in your face, but at the same time there is a story thread through each song that is moving, thoughtful and provoking.  The best record of the year hands down.  Buy this album! You will not regret it and I doubt you'll be buying any others anytime soon...this will be in your CD player for months to come.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is Green Day's Musical Achievment. THis is the most ambitious record of the year... period. It may be the best modern punk record EVER recorded. The is is the OK Computer and Mellon Collie of Punk Music.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Green Day for a complete decade now. They got me into music and they have remained as a huge focal point in my life as I grow up. With this album, they have really outdone themselves. It is a wonderfully artistic album and I encourage all music fans to give it a shot
B00003CXCT|1.0|George, George, George...say it ain't so! How can you change and mess up a classic trilogy?? I know you're the director and all, but damn...what a critical mistake! I've been a fan of the \\"real\\" star wars since I was a little boy and now learning of this 1st DVD set has been changed on purpose is very disappointing.<br /><br />  AP- \\"Hardcore fans already know this, but these are the special edition upgrades reissued to theaters in the late 1990's w/ extra scenes and augmented effects and creatures; Lucas considers those the definitive versions he would have made initinally if he had the time, money, and technology, and he has no intention of releasing the original versions.\\"<br /><br />  I'm a true fan of your THX audio technology, star wars video games, and of this series ,George, just not the \\"new\\" star wars, but the REAL 'wars all the REAL fans remember & love. I won't buy this garbage no matter the cost, sorry pal. Mr. Lucas has joined the dark side, very sad :(<br /><br />Give us the Originals...PLEASE!!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a fan of Green Day since 'Dookie', the year I started listening to real music, not just kiddie melodies and stuff. They were the first true rock band I appreciated. And I have stuck with them for ten years now and I have never been dissappointed. Everything they do knocks my socks off and blows my mind! They really do sound more mature on this record and I can appreciate this. Dookie will always be their trademakr album, but I personally think that American Idiot is closer to '1,029 smoothed out slappy hours' or 'kerplunk'. I dunno how I have come to this conclusion. It just seems to be this way. But at the same time they do sound like something for a slightly older audience.I appreciate every single one of their songs. I don't have a favorite. Coinicidentally, I was introduced to them by my then 10 year old brother in New York, and in late '96 we moved out to the Bay Area. Guess who lives one block away from me now? Billie Joe Armstrong! I have yet to meet him, but I think I will pretty soon. Hopefully. Anyways, hail to Green Day and all of their side projects! Hopefully they'll still be gonig strong another ten years from now!
B0002IQJUK|1.0|Every once in a while you hear a song on the radio from some <br />unknown that just catches your ear.  It has the groove..  <br />the soul.. the riff.. the words, and you say to yourself <br />\\"Wow, this is a cool sound.. different.. I'll bet this cd is <br />good\\".  When I first heard \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" while surfing the <br />FM dial, this was my feeling.  In this song, Gavin DeGraw  <br />demonstrates a bluesy, soulful, energetic style that will <br />impress the ear of most rock music fans.  Don't let this  <br />advertising gimmick fool you !!!  This song is the only one <br />like it on the cd !!!  The rest of the cd will have you snoozing <br />in no time.  Don't make the mistake of categorizing me as a <br />narrow-minded rocker, because my ear is open to melodies and  <br />mellow sounds as well.  However, I do look for SOME elements of <br />musicianship in any of the genres of music that I listen to. <br />With the exception of \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\", this cd has got to <br />be the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. <br />Put simply.. THIS CD COMPLETELY SUCKS !!! <br /> <br />- tom <br />    <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's a pity that today's TV viewing habits leave little room for expansion or inginuity.  If it's not reality TV, trash TV, or comedy, then it's not good TV.  Who says?  Firefly proves all those notions wrong, while still being able to throw mixtures of all those elements in.  <br /> <br />Want reality? The crew lives with each other 24/7, through all kinds of trials and tribulations. <br /> <br />Want comedy?  Anyone that doesn't giggle at some of the one-liners, smirky comments, and wity backhands needs to check their funnybone. <br /> <br />Want trash?  How about one of the crew being an intergalactic call-girl? <br /> <br />Other elements are a given.  Drama, sci-fi, and action are plentiful, and the special effects and graphics are just superb! <br /> <br />I never saw the series on TV, so though I have to wag a shameful finger at myself for not supporting this show at launch, after seeing this DVD, I'm a firm supporter.  Not since Buck Rogers have I loved a sci-fi series so much.  Please oh holier than thou network suit people....please grab this series.  Sci-fi?  Spike?  Someone?  Though I'm elated that a possible movie is in the works, I still feel the show has too much depth to wrap up in a 2 hour movie.  But I digress, as any continuation of Firefly is a blessing.  Mr. Josh Whedon, with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, you've single handedly re-invented my interest in television!
0345452577|2.0|If this was my first Kellerman novel I would have been captivated. Kellerman has a unique writting style which I believe captivates and keeps his fans coming back for more. But Conspiracy Club was not his best. I was disappointed by the lack of development of the \\"Club\\" members characters. I also found Jeremy Carrier rather boring. Though it ended with Kellerman flare, I fear it was a case of \\"too little too late...\\"not his usual page turner.<br /><br />But Kellerman cannot please everybody all the time, and he is allowed the odd bad book, as long as he follows it up with a smasher like Therapy.
B00005R5G9|5.0|\\"Mannequin\\" is one of those movies where critics completely raked it over hot coals because the premise of the film is too silly but was a box office hit. Although an artistic bomb, I loved \\"Mannequin\\". I saw it in the theatre back in 1987. Still love it to this very day.<br /><br />Andrew McCarthy plays Jonathan Switcher, a starving artist who moves from one job to another aimlessly because he focuses too muchon creating artwork as opposed to simply doing his job. One of his jobs was putting together mannequins for department stores. Before being let go, Jonathan finally creates his masterpiece. A few jobs later he comes across the same mannequin at his latest job working for Claire Prince Timkins(Estelle Getty). The mannequin comes to life as Ema 'Emmy' Hesire (played by a young Kim Cattral). Sparks immediately flies between the two. The only catch is that Jonathan can only see her while everyone else can see her only as a mannequin. The premise is silly but harmless. James Spader played the same smarmy, oily character as he usually does in a lot of his films (which is a good thing) as Mr. Richards, the head of the employment dept. at the store. G.W Bailey as Capt. Felix Maxwell was hilarious with his dogs Rambo I and II but the showstealer here was Meschach Taylor as the flamboyant Hollywood Montrose with his over the top sunglasses. He was hysterical. My favorite moment in the film was when Jonathan took Emmy out on his motorcycle and they pass an elderly couple in a car, not to mention the car chase when Felix and Mr. Richards pursues the pair. \\"Mannequin\\" may not be high art but I love this film.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|With all the extras, this is definitely worth getting if you have the original DVD, and you might even want to keep the old one yet.  I'll be keeping my old DVD because, while the deleted scenes on the old DVD are included in the first cut of the movie on disc 2 of this set (plus many other differences from the theatrical release), the first cut was taken from the SVHS copy submitted to IFFM for review, which means the video and audio quality is not very good (I guess no better copy was available of that version, so this is mainly for historical interest), and the deleted scenes on the old DVD are actually of better quality.  Also, Kevin Smith's introductions to each deleted scene on the old DVD are unique to that release, too (if that matters to you), although some elements are reflected in the new commentary track accompanying the first cut in this set.  So, unless I get hard up for cash some day, I'll hang on to my old DVD yet.  But, even if these aren't reasons enough for you to keep your old DVD, this 10th anniversary set is still worth getting for the restoration of the theatrical version, the historically interesting first cut, the documentary, and the slew of other goodies in this set -- you can always give your old DVD to a friend, or whatever.  And, if you don't have the old DVD, well, then, you're REALLY in for a treat!
B000005H3M|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this CD, and what a bonus you get on the CD vs. the LP-- lots of additional music.  If I had to pick two big band CD's to listen to, this would be one of them.  The other would be Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band \\"Swinging for the fences\\". <br /> <br />This band is tight and talented.  It's a must for any serious collection.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Once again, Nightwish proves to the world that they are the leading goth metal act. Once is another powerful album by the band, showing a lot of emotion from all members. Also,a new addition to the band is a choir and orchastra, which goes very well with their sound. My Favorite  songs are: \\"Dark Chest Of Wonders\\", \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\", and \\"Plante Hell\\". Tarja has the perfect voice for this band. Although less operatic on this release, she still shows she has what it takes. Overall, a great album by a great band.
1594200106|5.0|As a classics major in college, I spent a lot time reading most of the substantial works in the western canon.  Since leaving college I have continued to read at a brisk pace over the years.  I must say that I was completed surprised at this novel.  I had heard good things about it, but as is often the case, these reviews are usually lacking.  Not in this case.  This is one of the best books I have read in many years.  I urge you to read, experience and enjoy this novel.
B00008EY65|5.0|Good story with a new comic hero called Hell Boy and some comedy, you have to watch it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|If you want no political bs just look for the line of ******'s <br /> <br />Since politics is mentioned in every review I will tell you that I am a card carrying Republican (in fact, when I bought this album, I saw a person from my College Republican chapter, I bet I hear about that at some point :-P) <br /> <br />I am in lockstep with Bush on the War on Terror, I disagree with him on other issues though. I thought I would go ahead a burst the bubble of the liberals who think Green Day is just a hippy socialist kind of group. Listen to Holiday which is obviously antiwar, go on to question the protestor's sincerity.  <br /> <br />The lead singer is a registered Libertarian. <br /> <br />********************************************** <br /> <br />Anyway, this album's standouts are American Idiot, Holiday, Jesus of Suburbia, Letterbomb, Homecoming, She's a Rebel. Highly recommended... <br /> <br />--Joey
B0001Z53CY|5.0|It's really good album especialy the \\"Git Up, My Band, How Come\\", I just keep listing to them all the day, Make sure to buy the album with the bonus DVD it's contains \\"My Band & 40 oz.\\" Videos.
0800177177|5.0|Let me say at the outset that I'm generally not inclined to view horror flicks but this rendition of Bram Stoker's classic entranced me as a viewer as if I were under the spell of the Count myself. The screenplay is convincing and engaging, the sets breathtaking in their almost surrealistic panoramas of the Carpathian Mountains, the costumes are authentic and colorful (with the most hideous Devil figure I've seen on film), the special effects effective without being overbearing, and the acting superb in its intensity and talent and in its attention to dialogue and characterization. Coppola has scored is at his artistic best in this film, which tries to be faithful to the novelist's narrative. Moreover, the tempo is quick without feeling like a series of camera flashes or montages. The sets are lush in their attention to detail. Hopkins is almost demonic in his obsession with demons and vampires; never will you find a more sinister (and oddly at times sympathetic) Dracula with accurate historical references to Transylvannia's medieval past. And the mix of horror and sensuality is intoxicating and passionate. A must for fans of the horror genre and highly recommended for those who want a worthy addition to their home video library.
B000067J1H|5.0|Have you ever waondered if you will listen to the bad voices in your mind? <br />Did you thought what will happen if you did that? <br />Will you be a criminal or just a psycho? <br />To answer these questions watch the movie... <br />It's a great movie and one of the Marvels.
0385474547|5.0|The more the reader thinks about Things Fall Apart, the more he becomes aware that the heart of a story is about the struggles of an individual and less about what is a compelling and unsentimental survey of Nigeria's Ibo culture just before the arrival of white settlers.<br /><br />The story's protagonist is Okonkwo, who at first appears to be a model warrior and self-made man who slowly discovers that the attributes he believed would serve him well as an adult instead breed a fear of failure and profound frustration. He is a complex and heavy-handed head of his household who is at once sympathetic and cruel.<br /><br />Most of the story is told before the actual appearance of the first white settlers, but their pending arrival hangs over the middle part of the book like a rain cloud. By the time it actually happens in the last 50 or so pages of the book, Okonkwo has been driven into exile, his life a shambles. He has only a slim hope of redemption, and that is shattered by the arrival of the settlers.<br /><br />Okonkwo's story is a relevant one even at a time when cultural and political imperialism has turned away from Africa toward the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. But more important than its relevance is its artistry: it is a deceptively simple epic tale somehow packed into just over 200 pages, and one of the most impressive first novels on record. Don't miss it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't have the CD yet, but I heard it on MTV's The Leak and IT IS AWESOME! Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and Jesus of Suburbia are the best songs. Man, I gotta buy it. You should too.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a very compelling, if not all together satisfying interview with Robert McNamara.  Although, given the consequences of the Vietnam War, I suppose this is as forthcoming as we can expect McNamara to be.<br /><br />Errol Morris instersperses the interview with videos and stills from McNamara's life, whose first memory is of a celebration after the victory in WWI, the war to end all wars.  To listen to McNamara, he never wanted to be the Secretary of Defense, but when pressed by JFK, accepted the role.  He said he never regretted it, although judging by the lessons he learned during those 7 years in office, one gets the sense that he has thought about it every day since.<br /><br />McNamara has a razor sharp intellect that doesn't appear to have diminished with age.  He is so articulate on his positions, noting, repeatedly, the climate that was created at the time by the Cold War, and that almost any military action was considered justifiable during those dangerous times.  Through it all, McNamara tried to remain the voice of reason, but as he notes in the interview, reason doesn't always prevail.  One has to learn how to empathize with the enemy, which he felt Kennedy did with Krushchev in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but that none of them in the Johnson administration was able to get into the mind of the Vietnamese.<br /><br />These lessons could well apply today, as we find ourselves engaged in a \\"war on terror\\" on two fronts.  McNamara, at the time of the crisis, bears more than a passing resemblance to Rumsfeld, and one senses the anguish that comes with the decisions that have been made, at least in McNamara.  We may think we are fighting for Democracy, but getting that message through to the belligerants in a country is another matter, and here, it seems, is where we lost the war.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I'm a big movie fan. I have always been a big movie fan, and even make my living now in the movie business. Like millions of others, Star Wars was a big deal for me while I was growing up and had a significant influence on my imagination.  <br /> <br />Back in the 90's, I was pretty psyched when the \\"special editions\\" came out in the theaters. They were fun, but I had to admit they really didn't add or improve upon the originals, which even then were considered classics. When I heard that Lucas was making the prequels, I was REALLY psyched. Of course, after seeing Episode 1, I realized that none of these new efforts were going to come close to the magic of the originals.  <br /> <br />So now, finally, years and years after buying my first DVD, \\"the Original Trilogy\\" comes out in the format and box-set we've all been waiting for. But actually... its not the original, but the special editions with even more extra \\"revised\\" stuff pasted in... Huh?  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I'm all for preserving and restoring films so we can view them again with the best possible picture and sound, but that's not really what's going on here. Instead, the original is out of commission and no longer available to see (you know the original, the one that inspired the fanatical devotion, and in turn a billion dollar industry over the last 30 years?). Now its the new \\"revised\\" version, or nothing. I think there is something wrong with that. <br /> <br />So anyway... I enjoyed these movies, but I guess that's it for me. I'll leave this new DVD release to the suckers who want to keep throwing money down the Star Wars pit and don't give a crap. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|It's sad to me to see what George Lucas has done. The movies are (or should I say were) fantastic, and yet he seems to have nothing but contempt for what they were. They were an adventure through a new world, with characters we loved and scenes that we endlessly repeated. All he sees is a dirty old movie with strings and puppets, and he whips out his shiny computer and makes it into what he wanted it to be. Great for him. I sure hope he is finally happy and satisfied. To me, I think he is a selfish, greedy man who has succeeded in spite of his blunders and short-sightedness. <br /> <br />The DVD's will sell, of course. What other choice do we have? He won't even give us the satisfaction of the old versions included on the DVD. It's almost like he is too afraid that people will actually like his old work more than his new spiffed up work, and he is right. With re-making the trilogy, he has botched it up, and he keeps trying to change things, and he just keeps getting it worse. I wish I had the fortitude to boycott this DVD, all his toys, and Episode 3. But alas, I am too big a fan to let it drop, and I must be content with the fumbling, clumsy steps that George Lucas takes to reclaim his work.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Hello, my name is Creedo the Rodian. You might be more familiar with my distant cousin Greedo the bounty hunter and maybe even beedo if you know your history. I have one major complaint I have to set the record straight on. Han Solo killed my cousin in cold blood, plain and simple. I know a certain revisionist is attempting to sanitize Solo's image but it should not come at the expense of besmirching Greedo's bounty hunting credentials. I'll grant you Greedo embarrassed us Rodians by getting lit up by Solo, it was inexcusable to allow Solo to keep his hands under the table during the confrontation. Greedo made a mistake and it cost him.  <br /> <br />This episode is a blot on our history as a race but why do we have to suffer the humiliation of a self absorbed ego-maniac. After today people might actually think Greedo fired first and missed from three feet away. Was Greedo the best bounty hunter we had to offer? The answer is no, Greedo was competent at best but by no means up to Rodian standards. With that being said it is an insult that our people will have to bare for all time to allege Greedo could have missed from point blank range. It is not easy being Rodian and living down Greedo's stupidity has not been easy. It is going to be intolerable having people going around now saying Greedo fired first and missed. Please do not partake in this revisionism. History should reflect that Solo fired first. It is the way it went down. The events were beyond dispute until History was tinkered with.  <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|To Star Wars fans who won't let the \\"Original versions\\" argument go...get lives!!!  This is a moot argument that makes absolutely no difference.  Lucas is the creator and has the right to do whatever he wants with his films.  The important thing about this event is that Star Wars is finally on DVD.  I just wish they would do away with offering Full Frame versions of films. <br /> <br />Average fans take note, you will not be dissapointed.  This is the best presentation of these films...ever.  Especially if you have a widescreen HDTV. <br /> <br />If you are a person who analyzes every frame of these films and dresses up like the characters...seek counseling and quit complaining.  These are just movies and great ones at that.  Great DVD bundle!!!!
B000005IU1|4.0|In the late 60's while \\"La La\\" peace n' love hippie tunes dominated the west coast's music scene, in the cold and somewhat tumultuous Midwest a totally different sound was beginning to emanate. Particularly around Detroit, home of the MC5 and the Stooges. These bands, while it might be far fetched to call them outright \\"punk\\", where instrumental in punk's creation.  <br />I don't quite consider these bands punk because there is a distinct element of bluesy rock n' roll that most punk bands of the 70's where trying to eschew. But the social outcast attitude, dirty guitar tones and smart-assed vocal stylings that would later be the hallmark of punk where definitely evident in these proto punk bands. The Stooges notoriety stems from the fact that they have one of the greatest frontmen of all time. Combining Mick Jagger's vocal swagger, Jim Morrison's ambiguous attitude, a hint of androgny(later emulated by David Bowie and Lou Reed, among others) and an amazing and energetic stage presence, Iggy definitely owns the Stooges. Coming in close behind is guitarist Ron Ashford, who's rusty-chain-being-dragged-through-a-dirt-road guitar stylings influenced countless 3 chorders to follow. <br />Stemming at 8 tracks, this isn't the Stooges finest work. That would either be Funhouse or Raw Power. But it's definitely recommended for those just wanting to touch onto the early proto punk scene. The summer boredom anthems 1969 and No Fun still speak the language of teenage life today. I Wanna Be Your Dog proudly displays what is perhaps the first grunge riff ever written. And the somewhat long but kinda hypnotic track We Will Fall proves that Iggy and his boys, as anti-hippie as they where, still could not resist injecting a little psychedelia in the mix. <br /> <br />A milestone album from a truly golden age of rock n' roll.
0440180295|5.0|Read this book. Full of humor, existential spinning, quantum leaps, horror, absurdity and other life defining delirium. A favorite passage is from page 76:<br /><br />Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: \\"Why me?\\"<br /><br />\\"That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes.\\" Billy, in fact had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three lady-bugs embedded in it.<br /><br />\\"Well, here we are Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.<br /><br />This is a book that can be read quickly and frequently. The writing is easy and to the point. The imagery is active too. Passing from different times in time, from an office in 1967 to a hospital in a POW camp in 1944 for example, all I had to hold me in place was Billy Pilgrim. Pilgrim is the fortunate or unfortunate, I suppose there could be an argument either way, hero of the novel. Slashed at by existence and spun into a universal adventure that gives him two \\"wives,\\" three children, lots of dead friends, a sense of peace amidst the most heinous and hilarious circumstances, and synchronicity with himself through time and space, among other things, that moved me with its elemental truth. So it goes. So it goes.<br /><br />I hope that this book is read and read over and over, especially by school kids, who have English teachers who keep seeing this on lists of \\"challenged\\" books. I think there is an attitude similar to the scenes toward the end of the book when Pilgrim shares and hospital room with Rumfoord, historian of the Air Force. Rumfoord sees Pilgrim as a moron, and despite Pilgrim's eventual admission that he was in Dresden during the firebombing, to Rumfoord he still has no understanding of what war is. Such is Vonnegut to so many \\"patriots\\" and die-hard industrialists who perpetuate advocacy for such horrors. So it goes.<br /><br />This is a book that brings out many emotions, and evokes a sense of experience that has no apparent reasoning. A true classic.
0790729628|3.0|This may very well be one of the greatest science-fiction film ever to grace the screen.  It's themes, story, set design, cinematography, and characters have left an indelible mark that can be seen in so many of today's movies. <br /> <br />Having said that, why on earth isn't this DVD just spilling over with extras?  Where's the 2-disc multi-version set?  Where are the three or four \\"making of\\" featurettes?  Where are the interviews with Ford or the production crew? <br /> <br />Considering the wide influence Blade Runner continues to have, I feel like it deserves more polish then it's getting.  Warner Brothers really fumbled by overlooking this  landmark ... <br />
B00003CXS4|4.0|This is what Tarantino (and probably someone before him) dubbed a 'hangout' movie - it's not about the plot, or even the humor in the dialogue, but about the characters. Watching Snatch for the first time is to be jerked around (and hopefully entertained somewhat) by its elaborate but ultimately meaningless plot. To the watch it for the second or third time is to hang out with your old pals Turkish and Bullet-Tooth Tony, and to notice the little details of their performances which make their characters so vivid and endearing. Maybe not everyone will fall in love with this cast of thieves and murderers, but I think the reason for the comedic nature of the movie, whether Richie intended it or not, is to make it easier to relate to and sympathize with the characters. Someone else, hearing me describe the film, wondered if _any_ of the characters could be sympathetic, but in the end I think that all of them are. Even Brick Top. As Richie relates in the 'making of' documentary: 'I wanted him to be a character that people genuinely disliked...and I thought What do people really hate, and the first thing that came to mind was paedophiles. But my Brazilian cameraman pointed out to me...In England, molesting children is one thing, and torturing dogs is another. So I decided to have him torture dogs. And it was supposed to make the audience dislike him, but I found it had rather the opposite effect.' Indeed, seeing Brick Top's cheerful, earnest grin as he pokes a sharp stick between the bars of a dog's cage makes it awfully hard to dislike him. He loves his work.
B00005QEO1|5.0|Sure, Permanent Vacation got everyone back on the Aerosmith bandwagon, but it was Pump that truly proved that they were for real. The outside writers are still there, but their two best songs originated entirely in the band. <br />1. Young Lust 10/10- About an old guy with a young man's sex drive, typical Aerosmith song dripping with sex. Has a great 20 second drum solo at the end by Joey Kramer. <br />2. F.I.N.E 9/10- Stands for F*cked up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional, this song starts right at the end of Young Lust, there is no quiet space in between. Likeable song with more sex. <br />3. Love in an Elevator 10/10- The intro \\"Going Down\\" still cracks me up every time I hear it. Great verses, a great band jam in the middle, and, if you can believe it, more sex. Possibly one of their greatest songs if it had not been so overplayed. <br />4. Monkey on my Back 8/10- Song that boasts the typical Aerosmith crunch. At the time, Steven Tyler thought he was a real badass for using the \\"F\\" word in a song. <br />5. Janie's Got A Gun 10/10- One of the two great songs on this disc that originated entirely in the band (the other being \\"Elevator\\"). Dark song about child abuse and how F'd up the victims become, has a great bass line throughout. <br />6. The Other Side 10/10- This song was so good that is kicked the song \\"Deuces are Wild\\" off of the album! Contains a horn section and one of Joe Perry's better solos, I just wish this had kicked off a worse song than \\"Deuces\\" like perhaps \\"My Girl.\\" <br />7. My Girl 7/10- Is to this album what \\"Think About You\\" was to \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" not really a ballad, but not something you would imagine them writing because it sounds more like pop rock than hard rock. <br />8. Don't Get Mad, Get Even 7/10- The song is kind of slow and uneventful, but a name like that makes it perfect to listen to when you are really pissed. <br />9. Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man 10/10- Has a great intro called \\"Hoodoo\\" that goes directly into VoodooMedicine Man which might be the greatest Aerosmith song that no one has heard of. Has thoughtful lyrics and a great twin guitar attack by Whitford and Perry. <br />10. What it Takes 9/10- Surprisingly un-sappy ballad to end the album. This is possibly their best ballad since they invented the power ballad with \\"Dream On.\\" An annoying country instrumental at the end keeps this from getting a ten. <br />What makes this album better than \\"Toys\\" or \\"Rocks\\" is that there are no weak songs on the entire disc. A truly monumental recording, was one of the few \\"perfect\\" albums that got commercial recognition (The others being \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" and \\"Empire\\"). It's a shame that people do not recognize how great this was because the big songs were so overplayed. Just think about how great this album would have been if it had had \\"Deuces are Wild\\" instead of \\"My Girl\\" or \\"Don't Get Mad.\\" <br />
B00005JMUA|1.0|I am a big fan of the Q man, but what the heck did I just watch? I like twists, but after watching all 4 hours of the Kill Bill epic I felt like I had been robbed. Volume one was great lots of action, humor and symbolism. Volume 2 (with some execptions) was just empty and predicable. At the end I hated everything and everybody. There was no coolness, no latent hipness. No angst from somebody who was locked in a video store overnight - just a sort of sick contest to be the most unlikeable. There was a possiablity for a really cool ending that would have redemed some and explained more, but instead we just get a stupid joke and emptyness.  <br /> <br />I expected more.  <br />
B000000OU6|5.0|In \\"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,\\" Slash proves something that most of us alrady knew: he is a great guitarist, who plays with more passion and soul (he's half-black) than any other guitarist in the past 20 years. I'm tired of hearing this stuff from pop music magazines saying that \\"It's 5 O'clock Somewhere\\" is bargain bin fodder. First, I had to play $15.00 for this CD and it is impossible to find in any bargain or used CD bin. Second, the music on here is really good. Let's get started:  1. Neither Can I 10/10- One of the songs that is hard-rock influenced blues, instead of vise-versa. Amazing song about suicide and is one of the few songs on here where the lyrics are above mediocre, here they're really good. Slash & Co. sound great, even Eric Dover is amazing.  2. Dime Store Rock 10/10- Not rock music about a dime store, but the song is about rock that you would buy at a dime store, I'll let you firgure the rest out. Fast paced, great song with great guitars and remarkable riffs and hooks. Slows down into another blues song at the end.  3. Beggars and Hangers-On 9/10- Has one of my favorite riffs of all time. Could have been the best song on the album, but the verses are slow and boring and the riff doesn't show up until the chorus.  4. Good To Be Alive 7/10- Complex song, but nothing special at all, and Dover's vocals are annoying.  5. What Do You Wanna Be 9/10- I like this song, but some will find Dover's vocals annoying on this one too. A fun song, but most of the band except for Slash is mediocre. Another song that slows down for a bluesy ending.  6. Monkey Chow 9/10- Great song and melody with stupid lyrics written by Gilby Clarke, one of his only contributions on the entire album.  7. Some City Ward 10/10- For whatever reason I found the lyrics sort of funny: \\"He missed the pool by inches, so he won't be walking soon.\\" Hahaha. Sounds a lot like Aerosmith's \\"Nobody's Fault.\\"  8. ---- the Pit 10/10- Short instrumental with the first half being fast-paced hardrock, and the second part, bass-influenced blues written by Alice in Chains and Ozzy alum, Mike Inez.  9. Lower 10/10- Took several listens before I liked this one, but now it's one of my favorites on the album. Like \\"Neither Can I\\" is a blues song with a heavy hard rock influence. One of the only times in music history where that thing on the guitar with the tube where Slash makes his guitar \\"talk,\\" actually helps the song, unlike Peter Frampton.  10. Take It Away 8/10- Decent song is made worthwhile from Slash's solo.  11. Doin' Fine 6/10- A stupid song about a never-ending party, comes close to filler status.  12. Be the Ball 9/10- Even though the song is simple lyrically, is very complex musically. Slash and Gilby Clarke sound great together.  13. I Hate Everybody (But You) 6/10- Even with funny lyrics and one of the best solos on the disc, this song is a waste of time.  14. Back and Forth Again 9/10- A ballad that actually isn't that bad, with Slash's best solo on the album.  Slash had originally written these songs for the next GNR album, and they almost were (Axl loved them) but him and SLash had an argument so Slash formed his own GNR with Clarke, Sorum, and Reed; Mike Inez replaced McKagan, but Duff helped write \\"Beggars.\\" Many people complain about Dover's vocals, but for the most part, they are very good. A very good album that is overlooked because it does not have the GNR name on it.
0312853238|5.0|. . .and most profound Science Fiction novels ever published. <br /> <br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is a novel set in the not too distant future, where children serve in the great war against a sentient, alien race.  This book can be read on a number of levels:  simply for reading pleasure, for spiritual and moral enrichment (believe it or not!), for psychological understanding, for discussions on the morality of war, etc. <br /> <br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is a painful novel to read.  The thought that our wourld might get to the point where children are exploited (for whatever reason) as soldiers is becoming frighteningly timely.  Orson Scott Card deserved the Hugo and the Nebula he won. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|5.0|i am a major fan of Harry Potter.  i have been ever since JK came out w/ the first book back when i was like 8 or 9. i loved this book when i read it!  i still love it!  even though i read it like 4 years ago, it has still remained my favorite.  i think it is b/c Sirius and Lupin come in for the first time and i love both of them. [which makes the 5th book hard for me to handle. :( ] <br /> <br />anyways, i was very glad when this movie came out in theaters.  i had heard that it was very different from the book.  to be honest though, i couldn't tell, and it was probably b/c i haven't read it in a long time.  i just remembered the main parts and that was good enough for me. :)   <br /> <br />i personally thought it was awesome.  i had wanted to see this one ever since i first heard that they were going to turn them into movies.  i was very glad to hear that it would come out in the theater two days before my 14th birthday as well.   <br /> <br />the whole thing was awesome.  the way they set everything up.  the clothes were even a lot better this time around.  i thought that Alfonso Cuarn did a very good job.   <br /> <br />the story is getting way better than the last two.  it just makes it better w/ harry, hermione, ron, and every1 else being teenagers.  the whole becoming of age thing makes it seem more for older audiences than the last two also.   <br /> <br />all in all, i am very excited for this to come out on DVD!  i can't wait to see it again. :)  it is my favorite HP movie/book, and probably always will be.  when it comes out, i recommend if you haven't read the book that you get this.  also if you aren't too pickey w/ whether or not it is exactly like the book.  or if you have as bad a memory as me and can't really remember much of what happened in the book anyways. ;) <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I'm not sure what upsets me more:  the fact that George Lucas can't stop messing with the films that helped define a large part of my childhood..... or the fact that a man like Lucas even has the power to make a full grown adult, like myself, so upset in the first place. <br /> <br />Does Lucas realize the amount of influence that he has?  Of course.  But does he choose to use that power to set an example, or to placate his own ego? <br /> <br />I think the answer's pretty obvious when you consider Lucas's stubborn refusal to acknowledge the original versions of the films that inspired so many of us.  I'm not saying that by supporting Lucas in the past (i.e. purchasing tickets, toys, videos, and other various merchandise) that we're automatically entitled to a reward for our loyalty.   <br /> <br />But wouldn't it be nice if Lucas would decide to present us with a gift?  Namely, the chance to enjoy his original works of art, and to honor not only his past efforts, but also the work of the various artists that collaborated with him? <br /> <br />I guess one can only dream.....  <br /> <br />Or maybe I should blame myself..... for spending so much time dreaming about someone else's creations, instead of focusing on my own. <br /> <br />Oh well..... blasted Lucas!!!

0671027344|5.0|i got this book on saturday from a friend of mine. as you can tell by the title of my review i recieved it as a birthday present. i unwrapped it from the comic paper that he wrapped it in and saw the title and it made me laugh. i started reading yesterday, sunday. and i'm nearly half done with it and i couldn't wait to write a review. so here it is ... it's a great book, it comes from the perspective of my kind of person. i don't know why but this book reminds me of that old 80's movie, \\"Lucas.\\" i can't say much more than it's wonderful.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|ok first of all pretty fly (for a white guy) is not a poser song. It is however a song about posers and how gay the are...anybody who didnt notice this when they first heard the song was really bloody stupid and probably was a poser (posers usually are the ones to yell poser about others the loudest)....this a great cd over all, possibly their best....do not compare the offspring in anyway shape of form to good charlotte..if you do you deserve to be decapitated....the offspring was at one time on the same level as greenday back when greenday was good...Why dont you get a job and pretty fly for a white guy, which only account for two songs on the cd, are intentionally poppy, this is because the irony of it goes well with the song......
B00003CXCT|4.0|It STAR WARS on DVD. Its STAR WARS with pretty darn good sound and pic. So what are people's problems with sound, special editions and specks here and there ????? <br /> <br />Unbelievable !!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />If you like the movies (as most do) then get the set as its the best quality you wil see these films in and for a good price. I don't actually sit right up close to the tv to note down every bit of grain or dot that i see, nor am i a jedi nut or lives and breathes this stuff because i have no life of my own and must rely on some good movies to create a mythos that i can live by. I mean seriously, for the normal, sane, have my own life viewer who likes STAR WARS you will think that the pic and sound are pretty bl**dy excellent.  <br /> <br />These are movies that everyone has seen and have been re-glossed, re-worked and re-packaged for DVD. So if u want to own them then get the pack as they really are wonderfully presented and just forget the over-anaylitical reviews of those stating that there is a speck here, a sound drop out there and so forth because for most people this set will be good value for money and i doubt (unless your a zelous fan) your not going to notice any flaws.  <br /> <br />As far as the movies only being presented on dvd as 'Special Editions'......BIG DEAL....It is not like he has completely stripped the movies and changed it. I tend to think the re-mastering of some scenes and addtional footage of others ADDS more to both the movies and for the fans to enjoy even more of thier beloved Galaxy far, far away.....but no u got whine about it. Director's cuts have been common for years and thus this fits well with GL re-working of these movies. I mean overall he did a pretty good job and didn't take anything away. Granted it would have been nice to please everyone and release the orginal theatrical versions but he didn't so get over it. <br /> <br />I wish Steven Speliburg would re-work JAWS, u know make the shark look abit more realistic for this day and age and a few other movies that i like could use some re-working so it really doesnt bother me. I don't think GL has ruined his classics by what he has done to them and i still enjoy them as i did when they were first released. <br /> <br />The package loses on star though for Return of the Jedi which is a good 1/2 of a movie trapped in a really bad bear film. I mean those Ewoks !!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ?????
B00002ND77|5.0|Spike Lee did his best with this film. With an excellent choice of Denzel and Angela as Betty, this film truly is an inspiration to all Black and non-Black Muslims such as myself. It truly captivates the beauty of our religion and how one man truly believed in hard work and dedication. The ending was truly the most touching of all and still brings a tear to my eye even today. May the real Malcolm rest in peace. Ameen.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Some would argue that Star Wars is good no matter what.  That, despite the changes and upgrades, Star Wars is a classic.  While this is true, I think there's a lot to be said for *leaving* classics the way they were made famous.  It would be sacrilege to touch a movie like The Wizard of Oz this far down the road.  And would your grandmother's secret recipe for your favourite blueberry pie be the same if she threw in some new ingredients to surprise you? <br /> <br />Here's the skinny: to date, there have be 3 incarnations of the Star Wars Trilogy.  Some of us complain because we've seen and fallen in love with the originals and don't NEED modern technologies to \\"upgrade\\" the films just to fit them into \\"today's Hollywood\\".  Every film on DVD these days seems to have Special Editions and Ultimate Editions, featuring various version of each film.  I think it's only fair that what is arguably the most famous movie franchise in history give their devoted fans the option of seeing what they fell in love with.  I'm 24... so while I didn't SEE the original in the theatre, I grew up with them.  I have them on VHS and though I was petitioning for the DVD all these years, I think I will just keep watching the VHS versions.  George Lucas is being stubborn for no reason. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm biased.  I am not a fan of the new episodes -- mostly because I know Hayden Christensen and find that his entrance into the saga makes it difficult for me to \\"escape\\" into that alternate universe that movies suck us into.  Mostly, it's about betraying your art.  A few years back, another famous movie was altered.  They took \\"E.T.\\" and revamped it, digitally removed the shotguns police men were holding and replaced them with flashlights.  Now, tell me how that's the same movie with the same intensity?  A group of kids come racing to a barricade, worried their precious alien friend if going to be taken away from them... and there... at the barricade... flashlights???  I'd rather remember E.T. how I saw it as a child.  Intense... frightening... not dumbed down and sugar-coated. <br /> <br />What's more, some additions make no sense.  Gredo's hand over the table instead of under?  Anakin's ghost appearing as a young man instead of the older man he IS when he is killed.  Why do the other ghosts appear the same age they were when they died if he doesn't? <br /> <br />Point being: the original trilogy was untouchable.  It was comforting... like an old friend.  There was never any reason to play around with it and keep updating it, except to please a younger, hipper audience.  That's called \\"selling out\\". <br /> <br />Today's audiences are interested in eyecandy.  So I suppose this release has a purpose and that's okay.  But what about the older generation who've been waiting for this for nealy 30 years??  Star Wars -- the original versions, as is -- will always be my favourite.  But I'd rather pretend Lucas never got the chance to put it on DVD.  Do yourself a favour -- buy it on VHS.
B00008AWOD|3.0|Let me give you a bit of background. Placebo have been around for nearly ten years. They started out with their untitled album which was very good, an incredible mixture of melancholy and rawness. Still the best to date. In 1998, they had a huge success. Despite the fact that the album was clearly more accessible, it held some good tracks and went into a more explored layer of styles along with Brian Molko's cold and beautiful voice. 2000's Black Market Music was exactly that. Music for the black market.Black as in \\"dark\\" but \\"market\\" as in commercial, unoriginal and only there to discover for the people who had never heard of Placebo before so they could then say \\"this band is amazing\\".But I suppose it gave Placebo at its commercial rawest. Now, sleeping with ghosts is really different.Not to say it is excellent. It is ok. I guess the band have abandoned their raw edge to work on more melody.It is no where near as deep as their earlier stuff but it is probably more varied. Brian's vocals sound clear in front of the music and the Black Market meat grinding guitars are dispensed of, which is not a bad thing.After all, let's recognise it, what makes Placebo is Brian Molko. In terms of music, there is piano, there are ballads, rockers, and still melancholic moments of \\"old Placebo\\" tied up nicely with synthesisers (Special Needs). Put it this way, out of the four albums Placebo's \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is definitely the easiest to listen to. Placebo are a good rock/pop band but no one should bother calling them alternative any more.If I had to choose between \\"sleeping Whith Ghosts\\" and Muse's \\"Absolution\\" I would go for Muse, but between this and Strokes \\"Room on Fire\\" I 'd prefer this.

B0002IQHY8|2.0|It's very hard for me to write a review about this album without resorting to comparisons, so here they are. \\"A Valid Path\\" is to Alan Parsons what \\"The Division Bell\\" was to Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />You'll begin to wonder whether this is, in fact, Alan Parsons. Or, were Stuart Elliot, Ian Bairnson, Eric Woolfson and the whole gang what made Alan Parsons tick? Hey, why did Polly Samson write a Pink Floyd song (oh, I got my metaphors mixed, sorry). And that will be the easy part about listening to this album. <br /> <br />If you want not to be so shocked about what you'll listen to, I'd strongly recommend to listen to L'Arc En Ciel first, then to Return to Tunguska, and finish it off with Tijuaniac, then listen to the rest of the album. Why? Because I feel that, if you are happily surpried at first, you'll be willing to accept whatever comes next. <br /> <br />And believe me, it's nothing short of... well. <br /> <br />You'll have to listen to it and make up your mind yourself.  <br /> <br />Me? Check out my rating...
B00006LLLN|1.0|If you are an AKUS person, you'll probably go ahead and get this album since it seems to be the \\"latest and greatest\\" by a truly phenomenal group.<br /><br />The sound level is so out-of-control however that you find yourself constantly having to adjust the volume, especially when the yahoos start their \\"ye-haws!\\" and interminable clapping and hollaring.<br /><br />I love live albums generally, but this one has the worst recording quality of any I've ever bought. I've only had it two days, but that's enough time to know what I think about it.  Whoever was responsible for the sound quality ought to be made to stay in Kentucky with the squirrel brain eaters who so degrade this album.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Ive had enough of Mr Lucas and so called \\"artistic freedom\\". I am a fan damn it ! When Star Wars was originally shown in Sydney it included the love scene with R2D2 and C3PO. It was deemed too strong for the US audience and so removed for the US cinemas. I have no problem with this but I have just bought the Australian release boxed dvd set and find the scene not included. I didn't spend all those years sweating in Chewbacca outfits at conventions to be treated like this. Star wars is just not the same without the robotic homo erotica. (...).
B0002OERI0|1.0|I've already heard the song \\"Amercian Idiot\\" before this album was released. I used to like Green Day at one point, but now they're nothing but arogant \\"hippies\\". In other words, I'm sick and tired of these bands preaching their political speeches in their concerts (this includes Incubus, Dave Matthews, Eddie Vedder, and those I forgot, you know who you are). After all, don't we go to concerts to hear their music?!? Save your political speeches for conventions. I am boycotting this band and others that I've mentioned. Put a lid on it. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS!!!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I bought this album because of \\"Take Me Out\\", but pretty much the whole album is good - which is rare.  The songs have a good beat and don't take themselves too seriously.  I will be looking forward to new material from Franz Ferdinand!
B000000WCA|1.0|Spice Girls are NOT underground death metal, they're nothing but radio friendly pop garbage, and I'm glad they split. That Henry guy or whatever the hell his name is must be on drugs or something thinking that this is really death metal, but it's NOT. GET A LIFE LOSER! For REAL death metal, listen to Deicide, Nile, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Mortician, Morbid Angel, Cryptopsy, Children Of Bodom, In Flames, Suffocation, Obituary, Gorguts, Slayer, Sepultura, Brujeria, and Exhumed.
B00003CXCT|3.0|George Lucas' mythic trilogy is finally on DVD, and the millions and millions of Star Wars fanboys across the country will have their reasons whether to snatch this up or not.  Is the holy trilogy, now that it's finally on DVD, worth owning?  Of course it is, but to all fans who made the singular, unified groan that Lucas would be releasing the \\"Special Edition\\" versions of the films on DVD as opposed to the originals that we all grew up with, you'd probably be better off sticking with the original videos.  Despite that though, all three films look glorious, and Empire Strikes Back has never looked or sounded better.  I won't go into the storylines of each film, since just about anyone and everyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the last three decades knows it allready, but I will say this.  I, along with countless others, am getting tired of Lucas going back and re-modifying his films.  Remember his first film, THX 1138 (which is now on DVD, and naturally has all new special effects) which dealt with a technologically overrun society?  It seems like Mr. Lucas' life is immitating his art, and that is a shame.  Despite that, you know you'll eventually pick this up, but maybe you should give it a long, hard thought before George decides to \\"re-modify\\" his films again down the road.
0192802380|4.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.<br /><br />The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.<br /><br />Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.<br /><br />The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am 34 years old, I saw Star Wars 37 times during the summer of 1977, and I was 6/7 at the time.  I stood in line 5 hours the Saturday Empire came out.  I had a Revenge of the Jedi poster that I ordered from the Star Wars fan club. (YES, it was a REVENGE of the Jedi poster, not Return, REVENGE.  God, I wish I still had that, cha-ching) I had just about every action figure, ship and play set Mattel came out with. (Both the large and small Snaggletooth)  I still have most of the action figures, worn as they are.  Like for so many others my age, the original Star Wars Trilogy is a deeply moving experience and one that brings me back to my childhood whenever I see it.  I still have the first VHS set of the movies that came out, and have just about worn them out watching them so many times.  I have every reason to be a purist, and rue the day Lucas came out with the special editions.  But you know what, I don't.  27 years later, I don't remember every minor detail of the movie, just the feelings of wonder and awe I had.  The VHS versions I have watched over the last decades were faded and grainy.  Poor sound and special effects errors had eroded my childish enthusiasm.   But now, the greatest movie trilogy ever has come to DVD, and I am 7 all over again. <br /> <br />The picture transfer is amazing, and every scene (1 or 2 exceptions) is clear and bright.  A lot of work went into transferring the images from the original negatives.  The colors are awesome, and all the smudges and dust that were there are gone.  All the effects errors (Rancor Pit blue screen edge, Ben and Darth fighting with non-glowing light sabers) have been fixed.  My suspension of disbelief is back, I get lost in the films again.  The DVD's really show off the lost art of matte painting.  If you don't believe me, just look at the Cloud City exteriors on the Empire disk.  Try to match that with CG.  These films never looked so good.  Anyone who says they remember exactly how they looked in the theaterall those years ago is either wrong, or processes a photographic memory.   <br /> <br />The sound is fantastic, although I will agree that sometimes the score and effects overwhelm the dialogue.  Home theater is the only way to go with these films, you need to FEEL the explosions (crank up the sub-woofer) and hear the ships speed across the sound field. (Lightsabers make the coolest sound)  I like the changes in dialogue, especially the re-dubbing of Boba Fett.  The commentaries are a bit light, and Hamill and Ford are really missed, but Lucas does make interesting comments about the changes he's made.  (Why no Hamill and Ford, ask them.) <br /> <br />The extras are a little weak, and the centerpiece documentary was on A&E just last week.  I would have liked to see some deleted scenes, but how many times can you watch the grainy, cut up Luke/Biggs conversation from Star Wars?  If you even know about it, you probably have the Star Wars: Behind the Magic CD-Rom just like me.  Watch it there.  Ask yourself, do you buy a DVD for the movie or the extras?  There is a reason they are called \\"Bonus Features\\". <br /> <br />Thus ends my review.  Short I know, but for these films, I think a movie review is a waste of time.  Who hasn't seen the Star Wars Trilogy?  I will now delve into my thoughts on the debate raging over Lucas' changes.  If you're not interested, read no further.   <br /> <br />It is my firm belief that the Star Wars films are 100% the property of their creator, George Lucas.  Let me say that again.  The Star Wars films BELONG TO GEORGE LUCAS!  Don't give me that \\"they belong to the fans\\" crud, you and I did not write, produce, nor direct any of these movies.  We did not invest any time, money, heart or soul into their creation.  We watched them, that's it.  George is the artist, and the movies are his works.  If he says these are the films he wanted to make in the first place, that's good enough for me.  If you are someone who thinks there should be no changes, and moans for the original 1977 theatrical version, that's your right.  Here is what you do, DON'T BUY THE DVD.  Take a stand.  If you are so set against the Special Editions and the changes made, then pull out your old VHS copies, and watch them in all their grainy, pan & scan, mono sound glory.  As for me, I'll be laying back with some popcorn, gazing at the beautiful digital picture and listening to TIE Fighters and X-Wings zip from left to right.  Trust me; I'll be transported back to a time when my biggest concern was fixing the flat tire on my bicycle. <br /> <br />This whole \\"debate\\" reminds me of the Saturday Night Live hosted by William Shatner.  There is a sketch where Shatner plays himself at a Star Trek convention, and is asked what the combination to Kirk's safe was.  Shatner responds to a Spock Eared John Lovitz, \\"What are you, 35?  Have you ever kissed a girl?\\"  Let it go people, there are more important things to worry about than whether or not a Jedi screams during a death dive from a Cloud City catwalk.  I mean, how can you have a meaningful debate when the phrase \\"Cloud City catwalk\\" is part of the conversation? <br />
0385512104|5.0|\\"I like dogs.  You always know what a dog is thinking.  It has four moods.  Happy, sad, cross and concentrating.  Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.(4)\\"  <br /> <br /> Christopher Boone hates the color yellow and loves the color red.  And when Christopher sees numerous yellow cars on the way to school he knows he is going to have a Black Day.  Christopher is a 15 year autistic boy who had an amazing gift for detail and numbers.  One night he innocently stumbles upon the murder of his neighbors dog Wellington.  After finding the impaled dog Christopher becomes a real life Sherlock Holmes who he loves to read novels about.  During his \\"detecting\\" of who killed Wellington, Christopher finds out more and more about his own life.  He discovers that is mother is alive and living in London after believing she died years ago.  While looking for the dog's murderer Christopher finds out that is own father was the killer and has lied to Christopher about the fate of his mother.  Christopher's world is quickly turned upside down and begins a painful and very trying journey to locate his mother in London.  <br /> Mark Haddon the author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time has brilliantly constructed this story interweaving the thoughts that Christopher has throughout the chapters.  His naivety and innocence creates a strong sense of empathy for Christopher as he ventures out to find his mother while \\"fleeing\\" from his loving father he is paranoid will kill him.  All along I felt a strong urge to protect the pure and nave Christopher; this novel truly harbors a real connection between the reader and the narrator Christopher.  Haddon has done an amazing job and I would recommend this book to anyone for a fast paced unique book.  <br />
B0002MPU1K|5.0|Peter Cincotti's self-titled debut CD demonstrated his care in choosing songs, his sensual voice, and above all, his extraordinary piano skills. \\"On the Moon,\\" his second offering, provides evidence that his formidable talents as musician, arranger, and composer mark him as an artist that will be listened to for many years to come. To hear the instrumental \\"Cherokee,\\" shocking in its display of Peter's breathtaking virtuosity at the piano, is to recognize that Cincotti will someday be revered and respected much as Tatum, Peterson, and Evans are today. Cincotti's sensitive interpretations of ballads, such as Carole King's \\"Up on the Roof,\\" recall Chet Baker in that Cincotti understands there is no need to force a lyric or push a sound in order to convey emotional depth. Cincotti retains the ironic pain of \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" his nod to the great Ray Charles, yet manages to put his own stamp on this classic. Perhaps more than any other perfomer of recent vintage, Cincotti can make a standard both contemporary and timeless. Listen to his unique take on the Rodgers and Hammerstein favorite \\"Bali Ha'i\\" from South Pacific -- fresh and vibrant in its approach, yet capable of touching our primal core. Has anyone other than Cincotti unearthed Andrew Lippa's gem \\"Raise the Roof\\" from \\"The Wild Party\\" and given it the prominence it deserves? Cincotti transports this song from its off-Broadway roots into the realm of urban cool, but still manages to infuse the song with all the sinuosity and raucousness suggested by the lyrics and melody.  Peter's own compositions echo Lennon's and McCartney's in their thematic range from the erotic (\\"The Girl for Me Tonight\\") to the sensitive and spiritual (\\"He's Watching\\"). The CD's title song, \\"On the Moon,\\" is a winner that some discerning director will no doubt use in a film. I urge everyone to include this CD in their collection.   <br />          <br />
B0002EXH5O|4.0|You know, most of the reviewers are correct...Dave Mustaine re-recorded some vocals and while they take away some of the bite/edge from the originals, it doesn't really effect the listening.  For Chrissakes, people make it seems unlistenable, but it's not.  The remastering itself is excellent, the whole album has a beefed up sound which is good...but the real reason I love this is hearing Chris Poland on lead guitar and soloing<br /><br />on the 3 bonus demos...Rust In Peace...Polaris, Holy Wars...The Punishment Due and Take No Prisoners.  Just to hear Chris on these tracks is a Godsend.  Any fan of Megadeth's best era (Rust in Peace lineup) will agree!  These 3 demos are worth the price of the remastered CD alone!
B00003CXXS|5.0|I belive that jurassic park 3 had the best story line of the three because the first on was all action with no theme and the second one was really bad and the third had a lot of action and a good story line and rate it 6 stars 10x better than the rest.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First, Dream Theater is progressive, meaning some of their music will change.  Many people expected TOT to be similar to previous releases such as Images and Words (a great album).  TOT is just another chapter in the story that is DT.  TOT is an exciting and heavier album with many driving rythms and awesome runs.  For anyone who has listened to previous albums, listen to them chronologically, it is clear that DT's sound was changing more towards this style, and I expect the next album to sound as different as TOT did from the older albums.  It is good to hear a group that can combine skill (fast runs that are insanely tightly together earns my respect as a musician) and yet they are still able to change their sound and continue to put out new albums.  Change is good, it is progressive.  TOT is an astounding combination of technical runs and riffs with distorted guitar and a heavy, deep sound.  Many of the songs on TOT bear a more darker depth than some of DT's previous albums (Endless Sacrifice and Honor Thy Father - read the lyrics if you don't believe me) but all the songs are just as catchy.  Many of the songs on TOT should be DT classics and rank personally with other DT songs like Change of Seasons, Home, Under a Glass Moon, Learning to Live, and Blind Faith.  To someone who has never heard of DT, I can't quite explain their ability except for their musicianship.  They are some of the best there are.  I recommend this DT album to anyone and everyone, actually I'd recommend pretty much all of DT's albums because you get some varying style and some insane musical ability from DT.  AS far as rating the songs: <br /> <br />As I Am: A great song, more commercial sounding but still long and great, shows the musical skill of DT and has a very catchy chorus.  I love the opener, I always start this song up when I sit down to play videogames because it is great at helping ot set the mood. <br /> <br />This Dying Soul:  Awesome, starts in, goes to solo, has a great pianopart/solo, classic DT structured song.  This is the second song you will fall in love with on the CD (I'd be willing to bet) <br /> <br />Endless Sacrifice: Spectacular, a ballad style song that has some heavy pick up to it, great - no amazing - instumental part, and an insane guitar/keyboard run that is just so awesome and so tightly together.  You WILL love this song. <br /> <br />Honor Thy Father:  A personal favorither, the drum role in grabs the attention so quickly.  It is a dark song with piercing vocals(in parts) that simply astound.  This song is magnificent.  This song really shows that DT knows how and when to change rythms at the perfect time.  Simply Superior. <br /> <br />Vacant: This is the only song under 7 minutes on the album (it is the shortest at 2:57).  It is a slower song that is very reminicent of disappear or space dye-vest.  This is an emotionaly packed song that is emphasized by the beautiful piano part.  This song truly helps to counter the other heavy songs, and completes the album - both musically and emotionally. <br /> <br />Stream of Consciousness: This is yet another instrumental by DT, starting with a great guitar riff, this song still takes me away to another place, and is very fitting with the emotions a listener feels after listening to vacant.  There are so many parts reflecting around the core rythm to this song it is a great work. <br /> <br />In The Name of God:  This is the last tack on TOT, and is very fitting.  It is another DT song with a quiet begining that seems to explode to life, and then it completes the cycle, completes the story, and ends the album.  This song has an amazing chorus ( LaBrie's vocals are so piercing and are undescribably good).  The paino parts are great, this just another complete song that leaves a listener with a feeling of fullness.completeness (the feeling Change of Seasons gives, you know, it's like the story is over and the ending was everything you expected and more and it makes you feel like nothing could top it right at that moment). <br /> <br />Anyhow, Like I said earlier, I would recommend this album and many of DT's others (Images and Words, A Change of Seasons, Awake, etc. - take your pick) to anyone.
0790731924|4.0|Letahl Weapon 2 delivers action/comedy packed in 2 hours that it <br />stands well in the test of time dept.

B00005JLEX|5.0|This is all a great thing for all Seinfeld fans, greatest show finally after so long being released on DVD. But I have one question, I want to know, want to have solid info on all 9 seasons on DVD. Some sites say yes, some say nothing at all as if there is nothing like that coming anytime soon. So if anybody knows anything about it and release dates, just put it up so all fans could see and probably a link to the site/sites, something official, no independent websites because that's the only place i've seen this. Thank you.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Easily the album of the year, and the album that will put Green Day back on top where they belong.  Holiday is the best on the album, but each song is great in it's own way.  Buy this now, if you have any taste in music you won't be disapppointed.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I have seen the highly anticipated \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" at the theaters for the second time in a row, and the film was nothing short of amazing! It was like nothing that I've ever seen in a film before until now, especially since \\"Sky Captain\\" has lots of action and thrills that never let up for a minute! The direction of first-time director Kerry Conran was magnificient! The performances of superstars Jude Law (\\"Cold Mountain\\") and Gwyneth Paltrow (\\"A Perfect Murder\\") were outstanding and top-notch! (The last time that Law and Paltrow appeared in a film together was in 1999's \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", with Matt Damon.) Joining them are Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie (The \\"Tomb Raider\\" films), Giovanni Ribisi (\\"Flight of the Phoenix\\"), Michael Gambon (\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"), and Bai Ling (\\"Red Corner\\") in which they gave great performances as well. <br /> <br />\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" focuses on an intrepid reporter named Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Polly discovers that famous scientists are disappearing from around the world. During an encounter with one of the potential victims, there are a bunch of giant robots parading across the streets, destroying everything in their way. Polly sees the scientists' disappearances and the attacks of the robots as some sort of a connection, and she teams up with her old flame/avation officer Joe \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Law), the captain of a mercenary legion of pilots. Joe and Polly are investigating the case when the robots attack the city yet again, though in a stroke of luck, Joe/Sky Captain's right-hand man, Dex (Ribisi), manages to locate the source of the strange goings-on. Joe and Polly then travel around the world to find the evil Dr. Totenkopf (played by the late Sir Laurence Olivier, in a cameo via manipulated video footage), who is bent on creating a utopia of his own, a \\"World of Tomorrow\\", and destroy the world of today! And the world's only hope lies in the hands of Joe and Polly, along with the help of Joe's comrade, Capt. Franky Cook (Jolie), as they try to thwart Totenkopf's evil plans before it's the end of the world for them! <br /> <br />Jude Law, who plays the title character with charming, silk-scarf nonchalance, is likely to linger in the memory with the staying power of Indiana Jones. Gwyneth Paltrow's Polly Perkins character, however, has the makings of a Lois Lane-type character with enduring appeal. In their own ways, the characters are interchangeable with the appliances they battle, each a collection of attitudes and foibles. (Joe cricks his neck manfully before engaging in combat; Polly is prone to pouting as an expression of sexual tension.) But while they are busy saving the world -- an assignment that takes them to Nepal, Shangri-La, and beneath the sea -- Paltrow and Law fit snugly and happily in front of the bluescreen on which director Conran and his production designer (and brother), Kevin Conran, have built their entirely CG dream universe, in which actual sets are obsolete. And when Law and Paltrow are joined by Angelina Jolie, sporting a kinky black eye patch and a fetish-compatible tight uniform as Capt. Franky Cook, the confection is irresistible: three of Hollywood's most polished stars, assuming the contours of 2-D characters without irony or condescension. <br /> <br />And they never forget their silver-screen roots. \\"I'm late for a movie,\\" Polly tells her editor (Gambon, in a sly tip of the felt brim to his noir masterpiece, \\"The Singing Detective\\") as she hurries off to an interview a source at Radio City Music Hall. On the Music Hall screen, Dorothy is just realizing that she's not in Kansas anymore. This couldn't have happened; \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" never played in Radio City, another smooshing of fact and fiction, as is having the late Laurence Olivier \\"play\\" the evil wizard Dr. Totenkopf through the magic of pixels. Indeed, for all the grandeur of \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" visible on screen, hidden in behind-the-scenes technical specs, and audible in the stirring, enveloping score of Edward Shearmur, it's the little, low-tech grace notes that stand out. I love that Dex, Sky Captain's trusty, tinkering sidekick, chews gum like an all-American boy. That Polly's charm bracelet becomes a liability. And that Frank barks \\"Alert the Amphibious Squad!\\" Ooh, yes, please do! we reply, bouncing with happiness. <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" has it all: thrilling action, laugh-out-loud humor, an excellent plot, groundbreaking special and visual effects, and a great soundtrack as well! This is Jude Law's best film since \\"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence\\" and \\"Cold Mountain\\"; Gwyneth Paltrow's best film since \\"Shallow Hal\\" and \\"A Perfect Murder\\"; and Angelina Jolie's best film since the \\"Tomb Raider\\" films and \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\". Truly a DVD must-have when released, there will be no other film quite like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\"!
B000002TQB|5.0|I wish I had caught this when it had first been released. I've only had the album for about 3 months and it has become one of my favorites. I love brit rock anyway, and these guys had it together at that time.  It probably is not for everybody, as it is very British, but if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.  There is no comparison between blur and Oasis, I dont understand what the big deal was, they are as different as night and day to me. Parklife is a classic album of brit rock, so just check it out!
B0002S94BG|5.0|One Small Problem...    The first time I popped in the Legacy Version, I noticed something- \\"Hallelujah\\" didn't give me the same spine-tingling sensation that the version on Grace did.  The reason?  Simply put, the version of \\"Hallelujah\\" on the original Grace album had a much better balance, level wise, between Jeff's vocals and guitar playing.  If you do a side-by-side comparison, you will find that Jeff's vocals are too harsh and forward on the remastered version of Hallelujah, when compared to the version found on the original Grace CD.    However, all the other tracks on this reissue actually sound BETTER than their previous incarnations.     There's more impact on the drums, deeper bass, more detailed instruments and better separation (listen to the strings on \\"Last Goodbye\\"), and Jeff's vocals (his greatest strength) are clearer and higher up in the mix.    The unreleased song, \\"Forget Her,\\" is definitely the highlight of the second disc.  The remainder of the second disc proves to be an interesting listen that demonstrates the versatility of Jeff Buckley as an artist.    The Bonus DVD showcases the music videos, which range from average-well done, and a 25 minute documentary that features interviews with Jeff, Steve Berkowitz, and \\"behind the scenes\\" footage.  Buckley makes some interesting quotes about the impact of music on his life, that will undoubtedly find their way on an Internet fan site some day.  A welcome addition.    My other suggestion for Columbia would have been to include more information in the included booklet- perhaps more commentary on the Grace album as was done with the tracks on the second disc.    Overall, well worth the purchase for Jeff Buckley fans, and any music lover looking to be challenged and inspired.  Just remember to extract track 7 (\\"Hallelujah\\") onto your hard drive before you give away or sell your original copy of Grace.      UPDATE:    This is in response to S. Johnson's \\"are you people HIGH?\\" review.  Buddy, I read the same article by Rip Rowan a long time ago so please don't try passing off his arguments as your own (including his examples comparing Rush CDs over the past few decades).  Next time quote your source.    Now if you don't feel that the remaster & remix job is any better, all power to you.  I actually agree with Rip Rowan's remarks on how music today is geared towards radio-friendly compressed loudness.  In fact I think everyone should give the article a good read (just google it).    However, when in comes down to it, I trust my ears over anything else.  I've purchased many \\"24 bit digitally remastered\\" over the years and end up returning about half of them because they just don't sound as good as the original CD master.  I'm anal about music to the point where I'll do A/B tests between remasters and original masters using anything from Alessandro and Beyerdynamic headphones to an Eastern Electric Minimax Tube CDP to a regular car stereo system as a point of reference- before I make a decision on which version to keep.  I don't analyze soundwaves for compression or normalization or loudness- I trust whatever sounds better to my ears.    If you prefer something different, that's perfectly fine with me.  But if you want to act like a condescending audio-snob and insult everyone who prefers the overall sound of this remaster, that's another story...
B00008BXJF|5.0|It's amazing that after 35 years of existence, a band can arguably release their most brilliant album yet. Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew's well of creative juices just never run dry. Without question, Power to Believe is their heaviest album. Fripp has always created fantastic riffs and this is no exception.  It's totally smacking you in the face while tickling your mind. The album it most reminds me of is Larks Tongue in Aspic. The title cuts on both albums are found in several separate movements throughout the CD. \\"Dangerous Curves\\" is reminiscent of \\"Kashmir\\" in the way that it is a repetitive tune that grows and keeps growing into a crescendo. Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelloto's contributions are much more defined on this release and I no longer miss the playing of Tony Levin and Bill Bruford. Belew's vocals are solid and he continues to add his sense of humor with songs like \\"Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With\\" Powerful music. I don't know what you own by Crimson, if anything but I would recommend Red as the one to get for early Crimson (`70s), Discipline for middle period (80's) and Power to Believe for today.
0195067142|5.0|Devasting account of the Pacific campaign as fought by the U.S. Marines in WWII. I say forgotten because I, like many Americans, have always seemed to focus on the European campaigns, probably because so many Americans are of European ancestry. Once I started reading about the Pacific War, I came to realize that it was,if anything, more brutal than the European War. Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge recounts his days in the 1st Marine Divsion (The Old Breed) fighting (and remarkably coming out unscathed) at Peleliu and Okinawa. Personally, I had never heard of Peleliu, but after reading this book, I believe it was one of the toughest and most brutal campaigns of the Pacific War. Fighting on a coral island (which made digging foxholes impossible) near the equator (110 in the shade)against an enemy that knows only kill or be killed. And the water brought to the island had been contaminated by motor oil, making many Marines sick if they drank it. Mr Sledge tells his story in a matter of fact narrative that truly makes you realize the horror of these battles faced by American boys. Truly these men were our GREATEST GENERATION.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is by far the best of the three Potter movies to date.  Yes, this isn't a \\"reading\\" of the books on the big screen, but instead is one truly great film that stands on its own merit.  The acting is superb (for the most part in all three films), the cinematography is breathtaking, the mood and pacing builds a perfect sense of wonder mixed with dread, and the art/set design is the most twisted, beautiful, and magical of any HP film.
B000002UAU|5.0|Let's put the Beatles into proper perspective.  The Beatles are the ONLY band of this era guaranteed to have their entire catalogue in print 200 to 300 years from now.  Almost all bands of today will be forgotten except those that made certified classics or were the best at what they did.  Jimi Hendrix will be remembered because he's the greatest guitarist, Bob Dylan will be rembered because he's the greatest songwriter, Elvis will be remembered because he was the king and Led Zeppelin will be remembered because they were so damn influential.  Other's will be remembered, but only because of key albums, like Pink Floyd's \\"The Dark side of the Moon\\" or The Who's \\"Who's Next\\" and maybe, maybe about 50 to 100 others.  Other than that, forget about it. To all you naysayers, ponder on that for a moment and think where your favorite band will be a few centuries from now.
B00003CXCT|5.0|A few years ago, when all three of these movies were in the theatre, I took the day off and saw them one after another, in one day. <br />I was amazed at how much Darth Vader changes from movie to movie, and loved every minute of it. I have seen each movie during its original release, but there's something great about going from one movie right into the next. <br />When the three Special Editions came on VHS, I had to get them. And now, I'm buying the Wideescreen DVD (got to, I have an HDTV!) I look forward to my next rainy day, and all three movies in one day! <br />As to the changes from the original release to the Special Edition to the DVD version - it's a mixed bag. The additional creatures in Mos Isley and the backgrounds in the Cloud City add a depth not available in the original. Changes to Greedo and Jabba don't do much for me. I guess if I want to dispute it with George Lucas, I'd better get some studio to make my movie!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I have to say that I do like this album. Its not because its simply, Green Day. And I don't really care for musicians when they get into politics. But, I hand it to the band for going beyond those 3 power chords and creating a melodic sort of album. <br /> <br />This album breaks new ground for the band, as theres more intricate guitar riffs, and yes, even the use of an xylophone! <br /> <br />American Idiot reads as a diary, or day in the life of a man, aka Green Day's \\"rock opera\\". \\"American Idiot\\" is the rocking opener- setting the tone for the rest of the album. This song harkens back to oldschool Green Day, but the rest of the album is something different. <br /> <br />Mainly, \\"Give Me Novicane\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When Semptember Ends\\" serve as the \\"ballads\\" on this album, and they also illustrate the new sound of Green Day. Novicane is slow, with some great backing guitar, and I guess because of the dental reference, I can't help but be reminded of the video for \\"Geek Stink Breath\\".  \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is slow, but is reminiscent of \\"Time of your Life\\" in subject matter, its a song you might listen to and reflect upon.  <br /> <br />\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\". \\"Holdiay\\" and \\"Tales of a Broken Home\\" incorporate this new sound with bits of the old. I think \\"Tales\\" is the only other song that has the same sort of beat as \\"American Idiot\\". <br /> <br />Most of the songs are good, but its clear that the old Green Day is no more. They've definitely grown up, at least musically. I love the band, and I think its a great album but I wish there were more short little punk-pop elements (my ultimate fav is \\"Kerplunk\\"). But its also nice to see the guys expand musically. Rock on with your frock on, for this one.
B0000028UK|5.0|I think the review by Lauren from Duluth pretty much nailed it (not to mention how awesomely cool and rockin' most of Lauren's reviews are...you've got great taste, if you read this).  The whole album is amazing, but the best tracks, hands down,  are \\"Go,\\" \\"WMA,\\" \\"Rearviewmirror,\\" and \\"Indifference.\\"  I'll never forget one early Saturday morning in late 1993, about three a.m., living in a dormitory in Florida. I woke up, still half drunk, my girlfriend sleeping next to me. She and I had had a pretty huge argument before we passed out, and the whole relationship was nearly dead as it was; we could barely stand each other any more. I grabbed the warm, half-empty beer bottle from the nightstand, lit a cigarette, turned \\"Indifference\\" on quietly, and watched her sleep. I decided at that moment that \\"Indifference\\" was the perfect song for those kinds of moments...the kinds of dark, smoky, inevitable, warm flat beer moments. What a song.  And the buildup of \\"Rearviewmirror.\\" Wow. By the time Eddie's yelling \\"...saw things....saw things...clearer...clearer...\\" I'm about to jump out of my seat. And then the line \\"I gather speed...from you f'n with me...\\" just caps the whole cathartic feel of the song. Eleven years later, and it still hits me like it's the first time.  Just buy the album if you don't already have it.  Tell 'em, Lauren!

B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all i get sick of seeing someone who gets upset when a band sings or \\"protests\\" agianst the troops.  The band isnt saying anything bad about the troops.  Infact most rock bands do support the troops but they dont support the people of this country that are responsible for sending them over there and bands like Green Day are writing songs about them.  Greenday sings or \\"says\\" basiclly that this country is easily influenced by the media. Which it is.  For music this record covers many varieties of music compared to there other albums and is a nice jem in the ever growing moutain of rock music.
B000001G53|5.0|When the previous reviewer says that Kurt Moll may as well be singing Mozart I instantly understood the meaning. Mozart is among the most easily approachable and lovable music that was ever written. Let's face the facts, the passages in Parsifal are EXTREMELY long at times. This is not a gently sloping incline. It's more of a sheer cliff for some individuals...but what a view from the summit! Whatever my personal hang-ups about Wagner, Parsifal is very complex and truly spectacular....certainly this recording is.    Kurt Moll's Gurnemanz is not just noble and commanding but simply beautiful. Stunning. The long passages....soothe at times but mostly, his quality makes them INTERESTING. It's the feeling invested in the singing. And not one major role is sung without feeling. Imagine, Hannah Schwarz as the nameless alto in the 'communion' scene! Barbara Hendricks and Anna Silja listed among the Flower Maidens? Opulence!    Dunja Vejzovic has a wild and desperate quality to her voice that I may not have enjoyed in Mozart (for example) but here it works for Kundry. It works well too; not just drama and theatrics but musically it IS appealing. Julia Varady (a splendid Mozartian), for example, has that 'wild, desperate' quality of which I speak when she sings Wagner (e.g., her sensational Seglinde). Whereas Varady's is more taut and urgent however, Vejzovic is more fragile.    I can't spin tales about Hoffmann's Parsifal being aesthetically pleasing; the wobble is.....sigh! Let's just say that it's not his singing that makes this set so special. Combined with the other monumental talents here, his misguided character can be found completely within his voice. Mind you, that wasn't spite because it too works. I'll stop using that word now but believe me...I don't make excuses for Wagner or his music. If I didn't like the sound of it I'd have no qualms about saying so.    Then Jose Van Dam's tortured Amfortas....as if I didn't already think that the sound of this man's voiceALONE was an art! His Amfortas makes you clutch your own side with feeling (note...NOT your ear, your side; the sound is fabulous!). \\"O strafe, strafe ohnnegleichen...des ah!\\" That line reaches me to the core EVERY time. He conveys the torture and suffering palpably...all the more torturous for its beauty.    I thought Nimsgern's Klingsor was bitter, spiteful and venomous. I loved it! And in the exchange with Kundry during the summoning scene, the special effects had me mouthing a silent prayer! Another reason why I ADORE digital studio recordings.    The choir is overwhelming in its beauty and drama. I have had the opportunity but never saw the NEED to acquire another Parsifal. It will take a while.    Finally Maestro von Karajan. I don't understand the talk of having nurtured Vejzovic too much and yet focusing more on the orchestra to the detriment of the singers. Logic aside, I can't HEAR it. I mean, who can listen to the so-called Easter music or the Transformation music and still remember to speak??! The communion scene is awesomely conducted and the choir/orchestra combination is a great achievement of unassailable beauty, in my humble opinion.    So there you have it: from someone who's not at all into any 'spirit' of Wagnerism. Simply beautiful music. Whatever other meanings may have been intended with Wagner are buried with him for all I care.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl back when it came out originally.  Recently picked it up on CD, finally.  I think this is the most underrated album of Roger's long and distinguished career. <br /> <br />Caveat:  It's more like Final Cut than Dark Side or the Wall.  I believe Final Cut really was more a Roger Waters solo effort than a Pink Floyd album.  So, if you liked Final Cut, you'll probably like this. <br /> <br />The album is really the story of a rocky relationship between a man and a woman between 4:30AM and 5:11AM travelling in their car.  Complete with the trademark Roger Waters anxiety (\\"I just cowered in the corner/ My pyjama coat over my head . . . \\")  and psychological neuroses (\\"Arabs with knives/ at the foot of the bed/ Oh my god how did they get in here?'), it paints a dark, gritty and often bluesy (thanks Eric) portrait of a short moment in time just before dawn showing the strain of a disintegrating relationship near the end of already distant itimacy (another of Waters favorite themes).  <br /> <br />An album where the lyrics matter, but the music really helps create and support the emotion of the story.  The musicians couldn't be better - Eric Clapton on guitar, Michael Kamen on piano, Ray Cooper on percussion, David Sanborn on sax (taking a break from his light jazz work to really sauce it up), and of course Roger on bass (and some guitar).  The music is more bluesy than other Waters work, but rockin as well.  Wide spectrum of emotional timbre. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album, which I believe becomes more interesting each time I listen to it. Not really designed for casual listening or dinner parties, but then you probably knew that.  Roger Waters is one of the great storytellers of music.  Definitely pick this up.

B00005JN7O|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, like Van Helsing, is a pulp film. The important twist is that it's a science fiction pulp film, which has long since fallen out of favor in an era of special effects and complicated scientific explanations. In sci-fi pulp, giant robots look like wind-up toys (actually, wind-up toys were supposed to look like giant robots), ray guns go \\"PEW! PEW!\\" and advanced technology doesn't require a lot of explaining. In pulp, there's non-stop action, the heroes are ridiculously well rounded, and a World War looms around the corner.<br /><br />And oh yeah, dinosaurs. You can't forget the dinosaurs.<br /><br />Sky Captain begins with the majestic view of a gigantic dirigible docking with the Empire State Building, and we know immediately that this is not the 1930s pre-World War II movie we're accustomed to. It is literally the World of Tomorrow, the kind featured at World's Fairs-utterly unrealistic and colored by the biases of the time. Thus, instead of planes ruling the air, we have massive blimps. Indeed, the zeppelin we see is titled \\"Hindenburg III.\\" Presumably, the Hindenburg disaster did not take place in this future. This is the retro-futuristic era of the recent Batman cartoon and The Rocketeer, where dirigibles also rule the skies.<br /><br />Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), an intrepid reporter who always gets her story. She's like the Lois Lane of the 1930s. She receives a desperate message from a hunted scientist. The inimitable Dr. Totenkopf, played by none other than Laurence Olivier, is chasing him. Yes, THAT Laurence Olivier. The fact that the few scenes of the \\"bad guy\\" are actually digitally inserted footage of a man who has been dead for 15 years carries a certain resonance, given the inevitable plot twist at the end of the movie.<br /><br />As Polly struggles to unveil the mystery of just who Totenkopf is, she meets her mysterious contact at Radio City Music Hall. What's playing? The Wizard of Oz, of course (another plot hint). And then just as this movie appears to be a film-noir rather than a pulp action film...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />That's right. Giant frickin' robots. I haven't enjoyed giant robots this much since the Iron Giant. They drop from the skies a fashion similar to the villains from the old Superman cartoons. Or, if you've never seen those, the animated footage used to demonstrate the potential of flying Nazi invaders in The Rocketeer. Their single eye is Gort-like (from the Day the Earth Stood Still), vaporizing the ineffectual police who fire at the five-story robots with their pistols. And yes, the eye rays make the PEW-PEW-PEW sound.<br /><br />Enter our hero, the Sky Captain, Joe Sullivan (Jude Law). Apparently, zeppelins didn't completely overtake the skies because Sky Captain flies a fighter plane that's a bit like a James Bond vehicle. It can shoot missiles, whip around corners with grappling hooks (a nod to Batman), fly underwater, and drop magnetic bombs. Joe, in traditional pulp fashion, is absurdly well rounded: he is an incredible shot, a fantastic pilot, and is well versed in ancient astronomy.<br /><br />But what do the robots want? They want our generators, our fuel supplies, and two samples of every living being on the planet. Why? Well, for the World of Tomorrow of course.<br /><br />The plot gradually unfolds as the rocky relationship between Polly and Joe is revealed. Joe accuses her of sabotaging his plane, Polly accuses him of fooling around. They have a love/hate relationship that ranges from comedic to sincere. The two agree to team up after a mysterious female assassin (who shoots rays out of her hands and can leap file cabinets in a single bound) kills the remaining scientist.<br /><br />Back at his not-so-secret base, Joe plots how to track the robot attackers to their home base with his resident Q-character, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi). Dex manages to invent a gun that makes PEW-PEW-PEW sounds; it has a fin on top and everything, as if it were right out of a Flash Gordon movie. Then, while Polly and Joe discuss their next plans...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />Dex is captured, but not before leaving behind a clue as to the whereabouts of the robots home base. Joe and Polly fly off on a whirlwind adventure that will take them to Shangri-La, underwater, and to an island filled with dinosaurs. Giant frickin' dinosaurs!<br /><br />The entire film is shot through a fuzzy, washed out lens that gives it the feel of an old movie or a pulp comic book. Architecture is art deco. The robots are strange, one-eyed impractical things with joints in all the wrong places, just like the covers of a thousand science fiction novels. And all of it is done through the miracle of CGI.<br /><br />There's not too much for the characters to say, because this is a pulp film after all. Polly's there primarily to look pretty and occasionally punch a bad guy (or good guy) in the face. Joe swaggers and shoots things. And Dex is the anointed spouter of pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />Despite the special effects, Sky Captain retains its sense of humor. And whenever things get boring...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />This is a true rollicking retro sci-fi pulp film, in the tradition of The Rocketeer, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing, and The Iron Giant. Fans of older science fiction films will thoroughly enjoy themselves. Everyone else will probably just get a headache.t has a fin on top and everything, as if it were right out of a Flash Gordon movie.

0452284392|4.0|An E-Review by Kelsey Nakanelua of:<br /><br />Linked: The New Science of Networks<br /><br />By: Albert-Laszlo Barabasi<br /><br />The book, Linked the New Science of Networks is a great place to start in getting information concerning the connectivity of our complicated lives.<br /><br />The concepts presented our explained with enough history and insight that the reader will begin to formulate his/her own ideas.<br /><br />He takes us from Mafia Boy's hacking of Yahoo, giving a historical perspective on nodes and hubs. The emergence and relevance of mathematics and economics involved with networks. By laying down foundations in mathematics, economics, and physics, his concepts have credibility and I could grasp the overall concept that networks are becoming a \\"new science\\".<br /><br />His ability to bring the 80/20 rule of economist Vilfredo Pareto, the scale free model, Power Laws, and Microsoft's connection to the Bose-Einstein condensation is engaging.<br /><br />Barbabasi ability to use current events of Hollywood and Kevin Bacon's Six Degrees of Separation to emphasize how nodes and hubs are design in networks makes reading the book entertaining. All of these various examples point to the concept that there are well connected hubs and the fit hub is key to the development and demise of the networks.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the history revolving around the various topics presented. He identifies and credits Paul Baran with conceptualizing the Internet. The history then follows Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) involvement in the Internet as it involved.<br /><br />The closing chapters focus on the Internet, life and disease, the economy, and terrorist's networks. Barabasi touches on economic networks, by showing the links of Vernon Jordan, a \\"well connected hub\\" in Washington D.C. Having a background in economics, I enjoyed both his Power Law history and connection with Pareto. I would have liked to have more information regarding some other economicnetworks, perhaps, Greenspan and other prominent economist around the country. Or even a Wall Street or Chicago's financial network.<br /><br /> Naming the Al Qaeda networks a true web without a spider. Meaning the network will survive without the leader. These organizations and others like them have self-organized topology. He gives a brief outline that describes elimination of social, economic, and political issues, which will deter the desire to form these types of networks that lead to terrorism.<br /><br />I would also be interested in history and background of the military, since I currently serve in the Naval Reserve. I would like to know the history and \\"new science\\" information regarding the military and their networks and hubs. One that comes to mind is Oliver North, which would be tied politically, but interesting. Another network I would interest in the Whitewater network and the Clinton's involvement.<br /><br />Finally, the book deals with explaining this new science for our lives. Now, that there is an understanding of the different types of networks, I would like to see a formal plan for dealing or solving the problem areas in today's \\"linked\\" world.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and increased my interest in the field of networks.
B000022TSH|3.0|CHINATOWN is such a classic that even if the only existing copy was a third-generation pan-and-scan VHS dub, it would still deserve to be enshrined in the pantheon of great American cinema. <br /> <br />Thankfully, this DVD is a decent, though not spectacular, transfer. Although Paramount doesn't treat this classic as badly as their edition of THE GODFATHER, which has to be one of the murkiest DVD's ever, this edition of CHINATOWN is merely an okay print. The color balance and light levels are fairly steady, but I did see more than a dozen instances of brief trash and specks throughout the movie. <br /> <br />Not much in the way of extras here, except a short documentary with interview snippets from Polanski, Towne, and Evans. It's okay, but doesn't go into any real depth about the making of the movie. When Polanski describes his favorite scene, I was sad to realize it's a fairly inconsequential shot. <br /> <br />There is still an ultimate DVD edition of CHINATOWN waiting to be produced -- one that includes not only Towne's original script, but also a photo gallery of the original period photos that inspired the story. Not to mention some input or commentary from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway! <br /> <br />Here's hoping Paramount will soon start treating its classic library with the respect it deserves.
B0002DB52M|5.0|People who simplify this film as \\"yet another Von Trier female abuse film\\" are closing their puny little minds to one of the most original films I've ever seen. This is indeed Our Town gone to Hell, and it's so refreshing to see the dark points of the US brought to the surface. Anyone with the mentality to have viewed at least one stage play in their life will not find this film \\"boring\\" as some people have stated, but instead have their senses bashed about the head, which is a good thing when it's a masterful director such as Lars. AND I have a new respect for Nicole Kidman. Amen
B000053GTK|5.0|It's really tragic that Gentle Giant's fifth album, In a Glass House has became one of their harder to find titles. The reason was the original LP never received an American release. For some reason Columbia Records deemed it unfit for release. Apparently Vertigo Records in their own country felt the same way, so they got it released on the WWA label. The original LP comes with a cool gimmick cover with a clear plastic window. Despite this being their harder-to-find album, this is, in my opinion, one of their best. Phil Shulman departed the band after the release of Octopus, probably because he was around ten years older than the rest of the band and probably feeling a bit old, being in his thirties, while the other band members were in their twenties. This left the band with their most stable lineup of Ray and Derek Shulman, Kerry Minnear, Gary Green, and John Weathers. This lineup would last until their 1980 breakup. In a Glass House is a more rocking album, but the band still hadn't in any way abandoned the medieval influences that made them famous (at least in the prog community). The opening cut, \\"The Runaway\\" proves this. It starts off with the sound of shattering glass, before the Hammond organ kicks in, and you get to hear the vocals of Derek Shulman. \\"Inmates Lullaby\\" is a nice, laid-back piece, with Kerry Minnear handling vocals, with vibes. This piece harkens back in places to Acquiring the Taste, especially the percussion. \\"Way of Life\\" is another rocking number with Derek Shulman handling vocals again, but part of it mellows out with a more medieval vibe, and like often when the band goes medieval, Kerry Minnear handles the vocals. \\"Experience\\" is a wonderful number that goes through many different changes, from rocking to medieval. \\"Reunion\\" is another nice, laid-back piece with Minnear handling vocals, complete with strings (that reminds me of David Palmer's orchestrations for Jethro Tull, although the violins are from Gentle Giant themselves). The title track is another great prog rock number. There's actually a section where the vocal arrangements sound just like Yes (but replace Jon Anderson with Derek Shulman, and you get the idea). But the rest of this piece is Gentle Giant all the way. It might be more difficult to get a hold of than say, Three Friends or Octopus, but this is truly a must have album.
B00005JNEI|5.0|One of the most moving films I have ever seen.  Michael Moore can come off seeming brash and childish but in retrospect his mannerisms and questions are poignant and appropriate for the tumultuous times we are in. <br /> <br />I am used to watching a movie and escaping to fantasy . . . but Fahrenheit 9/11 clears our eyes, shakes our conscious, and shows us the reality that our trusted media and government had decided to shield us from. <br /> <br />For that, he deserves 5 Stars! <br />
B000002R0P|4.0|Interview marked the last Gentle Giant album where they explored a complex brand of progressive rock that they been doing right from the beginning. Thanks to the coming of punk rock and disco, their following three studio albums (The Missing Piece, Giant For a Day, Civilian) explored a much more straightforward brand of music (in hope of commercial success, which didn't happen). Interview is a more complex and elaborate version of their previous album, Free Hand. The title track is prime example, which is a rather rocking number. \\"Give it Back\\" is an odd one where the band gets funky complete with clavinet. \\"Design\\" is a very complex vocal arrangement, not unlike \\"Knots\\" from Octopus. Perhaps the best song on this album is \\"I Lost My Head\\". Starts off rather mellow, with Kerry Minnear handling vocals, before the song rocks, with Derek Shulman handling vocals. Here the music is more like the rocking moments of Free Hand. It's too bad the changing musical trends caused the band to simplify their music greatly with their final three albums, meaning Interview was their final album with that old prog sound. Nice album to have, although in my opinion Three Friends and In a Glass House are their best albums.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Well despite the somewhat biased and wholly expected spin I liked this movie. This is a good flick if only because it portrays to the world exactly how easy it is for a weasel to control a barnyard of mindless, milling cattle. It is nice to see someone has the guts to show these preening and obviously insincere clowns as privileged children playing politician. GWB really does need a good spanking! <br /> <br />and... the parrot like rhetoric coming from the mouths of some of the American occupying forces showed them to be just as idiotic as the mommys and daddys who whine to God about taking their son(s) away from them. A second generation of moron!  <br /> <br />I also liked the way the movie very frankly focussed on the hypocrisy of sending (or recruiting) the lowest rung on the economic ladder to do the dirty/grunt work for the corporate elite. If MM were to have connected the dots (keeping the quality of American educational institutions low to ensure a fresh crop of eager dummies for the governments next illegal and unethical incursion) I'd probably give this one a five.
B0000029DD|5.0|I honestly feel like I have no right to even judge or describe this album.  I can't believe that this genius has been gone for seven years and I am only hearing his music now.  I have been so down and jaded about music lately and this album has brought back a feeling of appreciation for true energy, talent and creativity that I have not felt in some time.  If you are looking for a musical experience on par with The Bends, OK Computer or Rush of Blood to the Head then Jeff Buckley's Grace is for you. <br />     The tracks on this album are infused with love, passion, pain, longing and nostalgia.  The lyrics are poignant, the music is driving and Buckley's one of a kind voice reigns over it all with such ethereal clarity.  The song \\"Grace\\" is encapsulates what is best in music from the early 90's.  \\"Last Goodbye\\" and \\"Lover You Should Have Come Over\\" break your heart.  \\"Halleluja\\" is one of the most achingly beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard.   <br />     Give this album a chance and you will be struck by two things at once: sheer amazement that this is Buckley's first true studio album and sadness that his untimely death prevented us from hearing what his amazing potential could have done in the future.
B00004XOWM|1.0|rate this 1.5 stars. My Way and Rollin'are improvements over prievious Limp Bizkit hits like Faith, and Nookie, but this band still blows.
B00000720W|4.0|This cd was Mayhems first recording. The vocals f***king suck and so does the recording,but besides all that the guitars are awsome.  <br /> <br />The first time I heard Mayhem was when I was getting into black metal. This is one of the best black metal groups of all time. I like all the songs on this cd. If you like black metal and are starting to get into them buy this cd or there other cd called \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.\\"  <br /> <br />I hope this review helps  <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|Simply put, this is the package that Star Wars fans have waited years for. After toiling with beat up video tapes, devoted fans can finally revel in the splendor of DVD's crisp picture, amazing sound, and stunning clarity, for each film has been remastered to have all of these and more in stunning quality. The picture is incredibly sharp, and while it will never look as clear as the digital film used in the latest films, it looks quite good. The sound is good--definately to be enjoyed on a nice home theater system. The package comes with a bevy of extras that should keep the fans happy.<br /><br />The only thing any good Star Wars fan will complain about is the fact that Lucas has once again made changes to the movies. Why? We all understand that Lucas was frustrated with the level of technology available and how it impacted his vision, but these are the movies fans have grown to love and the fans do not want them changed. It is too bad that Lucas has chosen to ignore the will of the fan and add things to make himself content.<br /><br />Everyone, from the diehard Star Wars fan to the passing enthusiast who might have caught Episode II on HBO should get this package and relive the saga from the beginning and see just how GREAT this sci-fi classic really is.
6304698798|5.0|I never cared much for westerns before Leone made this one. Good guys with white hats on white horses singing by the campfire and mean stinky bad guys all in black... blah! Considering this flick is over thirty-five years old already I'm a little surprised that it's still (IMO) the best western ever made.  <br /> <br />Like a few others have said the panoramic views are fantastic and absolutely it needs to be viewed in the original wide screen format. You don't want to loose any of  Leone's vision... it would be like reformatting a Kubrick film or being forced to hear Brown Shoes Don't Make It on a three inch AM radio speaker.  <br /> <br />I particularly enjoy the way the three personality types are anything but archetypes or perfect stereotypes.  Each character reflects a little of the other's personality at different times in the flick. Ugly, Good and Bad all trade off each other beautifully in this story sharing traits sometimes only suggested in a very quick facial expression (a pretty good reason for some of the close ups I think).  <br /> <br />Let's see... interesting storyline, excellent casting, fantastic cinematography, dynamite soundtrack, memorable performances from all involved in a near perfect digital format. It couldn't be more deserving of a high 5!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Everyone reviewing these movies are citing their personal religious beliefs and downing Christianity and personally attacking mel Gibson. Whatever Dudes. Here is a movie review <br /> <br />The movie was indeed graphic as was gladiator and the patriot which i also loved. Some events are graphic just like some video games are graphic get over it people. We see worse stuff on the evening news. The coolest part i thought of the movie was that you hardly even had to read the subtitles which really speaks volume for the directing and acting. Well just thought i'd give an actual review on the movie. Oh yeah and it's a true story how cool is that. Oh and i am sure i am going to get blasted here for saying its true but even athiests believe that there was a Christ.
B0002UXBD6|4.0|A friend of mine bought this early the day it came out and called me raving about it that night. I was skeptical at first, having heard the single before and not really being happy with it. I went out and bought it and listened to it all the way through. <br />This is really a well done album and shows the band's maturity. The music builds off all of their earlier stuff but is different in its own way. It might become my favorite green day album to date, my favorite song was holiday and my least favorite was american idiot.
B00008PW2D|5.0|I love Sex and the City, every season of it. I have purchased all the DVD's for Sex and the City. Season Five is one of the seasons that I have a complaint about, not to Sex and the City, but to HBO. I don't think its fair, just as many people don't, that HBO charge us full price for Season Five when it is only 8 episodes. If they would have put decent special features, then it would be worth the money. If you're as passionate with Sex and the City as I am, then I would recommend buying this season to complete your collection. The episodes aren't disappointing, it's just the price and lack of special features, which is not Sex and the City's fault.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought this CD on the 1st night it came out, and I immediately LOVED it. It rocks. If you're a Green Day fan, you have to go out and get this CD because it ROCKS!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This cd I am happy to say is every bit as good as dookie is. It just reflects an older and more mature Green Day.  Something, we<br /><br />saw a little of on Nimrod and a lot of on Warning.  There music has finally transitioned into reflecting the adults they have now become and the result is nothing short of amazing.  I look forward to seeing a lot more from them in the future.
0792844882|5.0|This might have been just another young-girl-follows-her-dreams-to-the-big-city-only-to-lose-everything-yet-discover-her-true-self story. But Eszterhas and Verhoeven ensure that \\"Showgirls\\" is at least more memorable than that. Violent over-acting, jaw-droppingly bad dialogue, and a narrative radiantly free of plot will have these 131 minutes of celluloid burned agonizingly into your cortex for all eternity. Others have defended this film as a brilliant satire of American culture along the lines of \\"Starship Troopers\\".  But the battery of ludicrous sex scenes, flailing pudenda, and languorous lesbian kisses give the game away: perhaps the crowning achievement of the Hollywood erotic-thriller sub-genre, \\"Showgirls\\" unwittingly exposes it for what it always was - an excuse to fill the screen with a few dozen pair of admittedly shapely and extremely well-lit breasts. What I want to know is how they all did it without laughing - especially Eszterhas, who apparently got paid $2 million for his \\"work\\". Can I have that job? Please?!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have every one of Green Days albums, and hands down this is their masterpiece. They have gone through many transitions, from their hardcore street punk days, to the invention of the pop punk rock genre, and through a slightly folksy stage with their album \\"Warning\\". And with each stage they got better. From the same 3 chords in every song, to many distict and kick ass riffs and melodies, to complex acoustic cords. And finally Green Days maturity in music as climaxed in this epic, emotional and mature album. Of course they still have taht hard punky edge, if they didnt they wouldnt be Green Day, but their sound in this album is awe-inspiring. These are slso definalty Green days best lyric they have ever wrote.  People who dont like, or appreciate this album does not comprehend green day, and has never understood them. Every previous album has been leading to this, this album is Green Day, not Dookie or Nimrod, but this album. te reason green Day is still around is because they are constantly changing, growing. Please if your are a long time fan of Greenday, from their first album to their last, you will understand this epic, masterwork, of story and song, in the best album Green Day has ever made. Please buy it. Please
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hello, <br />this is a 2 part review of the DVD set for Star Wars... <br />1) the set itself... <br />I found the sound and picture to be of the highest quality and I own a box set of laserdiscs of these movies.  It was also nice to have commentaries by George Lucas for the movies (something that many directors still don't do).  The bonus DVD contains HOURS of extras and is really interesting. <br />2) the uproar regarding the changes.... <br />Yes, I was suprised to see some of the changes since the movies aired and even since my laserdiscs were made ...BUT unlike some of the misguided people, who have reviewed this set ...I DON'T think these movies belong to the people who watched them....they belong to the creator and producer ...Mr Lucas.  If he feels that technology can be utilized to update/ upgrade them to his original vision or to make the series of 6 stories more complete....its his call.  Honestly....after a decade or more of upgrades on CDs by remastering you'd think people would be used to the fact that it can and will be done....this isn't on a par with colorizing black and white movies....and the same reviewers who accuse Mr Lucas of defacing these films are  arrogant enough to say that they ...the viewing public are the rightful owners of them....that is pure nonsense.  I appreciate someone writing that changes to a movie they love ruins the experience for them...and can respect that.  To slander the person who created these movies and make personal attacks isn't  very classy and would encourage anyone to disregard reviews by people making personal attacks part of their review as they obviously are unstable and have an attachment to these films that is not healthy...they're just movies and entertainment for goodness sakes...these characters are not real and the inclusion of an extra scene that changes their motivation ...blah blah blah..is psycho! <br /> <br />bottom line..a very entertaining set....well produced and with hours of fun extras.... <br />thanks.
0812589041|4.0|Ender's game is one hell of an entertaining novel.  It is like a summer blockbuster movie, which grabs a hold of you and you sit back in your seat in awe.  The pages of this book are basically devoured rather than read.  You just race though it, and it isn't until you have completed it, and have time to catch your breath, that you wonder how good it really was.    Ender's game begins, as with every chapter, a dialogue between usually two people discussing what to do about Ender's life.  His real name is Andrew but they have given him the name Ender.  Government forces are keeping a close eye on this boy to see if he is who they think is.  Someone who is going to save the world.  Ender has a brother named Peter who he hates but wishes could love him.  He has a sister Valentine, who he adores, possibly the only one in the world Ender loves.  All three are child geniuses, child prodigies, and they behave in that fashion, rather than acting like normal kids.  The government runs tests on Ender to see if he will pass them.  Ender has no clue.  Eventually they see he is fit to go to a \\"battle school\\" for kids where they learn how to become soldiers.  Most of the novel takes place here, where Ender learns the various strategies needed to defeat the enemy, which are \\"the buggers\\" who attacked earth some 70 years ago, and supposedly are getting ready to attack again.  Ender goes from being afraid and isolated , to being cold and efficient, a brilliant leader, all along destroying the person he really wants to be.  Much of this is mean spirited, but very accurate on how young boys would behave in this kind of a situation.  There is a side story about how Peter and Valentine cause some commotion while Peter is gone, but the main heart of the story is Ender's transformation.  The government is, it seems, always on step ahead of him, molding him into the person they believe will save all humanity from \\"the buggers\\"  I dare not reveal anymore so as not to ruin any surprises or plot twists.    Although Ender's game is relentlessly exciting it is also flawed when you look at it.  At least I thought it was.  I found two reasons that prevented this book from reaching the potential that it could have had.  One, was the underdeveloped side story of how Peter and Valentine attempt to take over the world.  I felt the book would have been more powerful without it, and if it did need to be explored than Card should have put more pages into it so the novel would have been longer.  Either way the story felt like more of a distraction than a help to me.  Card does the best he can to tie it all together, however,  I think the heart of the story was Ender and his coming of age.  The other thing that bothered me was the final 15 pages.  I  think the novel would have been so much better if they could have left a bit more to wonder about, to think about, a bit more \\"what if's\\" if you will.  Instead the book has to explain everything that happened and why it happened, instead of giving us more of the awe and wonder which was so prevalent in all the story leading up to it.  Card does throw in a nice twist near the end of the story, and that worked, but I just did not like how Ender had to discover what the computer game really meant in the end of the novel.  It eliminates  so much of the awe that could have taken place had Card cut off the ending sooner.     It may sound like mentioning these two things would keep me from recommending Ender's Game.  Quite the opposite is true.  I highly recommend you go read it for its breathtaking pace, and for its originality and many moments of poignancy and depth it explores.  It certainly is no LORD OF THE FLIES, as far as exploring how far boys will go when pushed to the limit, but you will always be riveted, that is a promise.  Ender's game is a summer blockbuster for books, it will never leave you bored, but it fails to reach the potential it could have had.    Grade: B+
B00005JGAF|5.0|This cd might change your life.  All the tunes are upbeat, catchy, and classic.   <br />
B00028HBKC|3.0|Mel Gibson has exploited the most common story ever portrayed. At some points it seemed to be almost sado-masochistic on his part. Because of the subject matter people have taken it so sincerely they have even created a \\"Passion of the Christ Gospel\\". It is sad that people dwell so intensely on the death of a man whose life stood for love and peace. Jesus did not want to die, but he knew that he had to in order to make a point for all of the murderous, unloving cretins that could not love themselves or others. The saddest part is that the same sort of people are still killing him over and over..and now you can see it on DVD! I don't recall reading any of this gore in  the gospels albeit it is well known that the Romans were a blood thirsty culture. If people could just live their life with honest integrity Jesus would have never had to go through this in the first place. The acting is sincere and the movie itself is a valid portrayal of life in those very hard and confusing times. I only hope we don't have to see him murdered too many more times after this. Let's try to concentrate on what he did and said when he was alive!
B0002OERI0|5.0|if have loved green day since i got nimrod when i was like 8. ive bought every one of there cds since and will continue to until they stop making new ones. american idiot is amazing. the way they colaborated this cd is billiant. these guys are mentally guineuses and musically gifted. this cd is different from past cds but thats ok. this cd takes a new turn in the right direction. some stand out track are 1: jesus of suburbia(my favorite and many others favorite, truly amazing song(s). <br />2: boulevard of broken hears.(another great and slower song) <br />if you are a green day fan you should already own this but if your not sure if its any good, GO BUY THIS. this is truly one of the greatest albums ive herd in a long time!!!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Some people may not agree with the placement of prequel actors into the movies, but i think with where they did do it it made the Trilogy all the better. Great to watch anytime, everyone needs to own this set!
1591840562|5.0|A quick easy read for anyone wanting to start something.  As someone who's founded a company, helped raise venture capital, and had a lot of experience growing companies; I can say that this book brings it together better than any I've read.   <br /> <br />Start with this book to get your basics down (and you DON'T have them down if you haven't read this book).  The time you spend reading it will be paid back within days by the extra focus it brings to your efforts.  Then pick up other books as necessary to go deep (I particularly recommend Guy's \\"Selling the Dream\\" if you're at all interested in evangalistic marketing). <br />
B000000WCV|5.0|I love daft punk. Its so original. It was there at the beginning. This is an excellent album. Look at how many reviews it has. This album got around and its so popular. How can you not like it. Sure it has its flaws, but what album doesn't. ( If you find one that doesn't please email me - crome06@hotmail.com) Its such a great one to listen to no matter how old it is. If you don't have this album there is no reason you shouldn't, and i don't throw 5 stars around mildly.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan ever since I was in middle school (I'm now a College Grad).  I loved the fast guitar playing and most of their lyrics.  I have bought every album since Dookie.  I would have to say that out of all of the Green Day albums \\"AMERICAN IDIOT\\"  is definitely one of their best.  Some songs on this album are reminiscent of the Ramones (especially American Idiot).  Then they have the guitar style that they had for the Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod(my # 1 Favorite album) albums.  Then they have a few songs that are reminiscent of their songs \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" and \\"Good Ridance (Time of Your Life)\\" as well as a few that sound a lot like their \\"WARNING\\" album (my 2nd favorite before this album).  In my opinion this is one of their best albums, It is definitely better than Shananigans (their \\"movie\\" and \\"cover\\" album).  I am usually one of those type people who have to listen to an album several times before I start to like it, however with this album I liked it from the first notes to the last notes.  In my book \\"AMERICAN IDIOT Scores Big!  By far one of the best Green Day Albums EVER!
B000001ESP|4.0|Rush's 'Moving Pictures' is like what 'No More Tears' is to Ozzy, and 'Number of the Beast' is to Iron Maiden. It's the cream of the crop, the best of the artists's catalog. This Canadian powerhouse was formed in the early 1970's, playing hard-driving progressive rock. Starting with this album, in 1981, they started to play more synth-based, less progressive hard rock. Later on, they got a little too synthesized, but this album is probably their best. It includes the hard rocking smash hit 'Tom Sawyer' as well as the rather straightfoward 'Limelight'. Another standout track is the hard rocking highway song 'Red Barchetta'.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Lucas has finally put this out on dvd- as a big fan of the original (epIV) and not a very big fan of the others I'll concentrate on it- I hate directors cuts- in EVERY single case it proves to me that the stuff belonged on the cutting room floor, and someone with more wisdom than the director needed to keep it there. The stuff he added to this is pointless in the extreme- it consists of shlocky slap stick, like flying mechanical bugs getting swatted, etc. I found every bit intrusive, stupid and wholly uncalled for. Especially with a film like this you need to leave it alone or at least offer it in the original and extended- I hate haveing it force fed down my throat with no opt- out- I see the makers of \\"aliens\\" finally discovered that- they ruined that movie in the directors hack, I mean cut. This is no better- I don't know if lucas is trying to sell extra toys or what, or if it's some self aggrandizing complex he has, but leave it alone and put it out like it was. I gave it three for that reason. Also the audio was rather thin and harsh at times, especially during flybys and laser blasts, etc- grow up and use DTS-
0385510438|3.0|I'm ready for Grisham to return to writing books like The Runaway Jury. The ending in this book as well as the King of Torts left a lot to be desired.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is a great band to throw in the CD player and hit the road to.  Also to cook to while you're getting ready for friends to come over.  Also to jam out to when you're alone.  The riffs are unique, the lyrics deep, the melodies gripping.  Get it.  Get it now.  You won't be disappointed.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|I have had a hard time listening to this CD.  I love Ray Charles but this CD is a poor attempt at a final goodbye.  Whoever mastered of the original tapes, should have their hearing checked. I found off pitch singing and questionable tempos on most of the tracks. Most of this should have been fixed in the studio.   <br /> <br />However, some of the tracks are great especially Ray and Bonnie Raitt on \\"Do I ever cross your mind\\" and with Gladys Knight on \\"Heaven Help us All\\". As a whole, this CD reminds me of the Sinatra Duets.  That album also had many of the same problems.  <br /> <br />I will purchase other Ray Charles CD's but, God Bless Ray, I will not purchase this CD for my friends.
0440237688|4.0|<br />Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" explores a world where the passionate emotions that make humans individuals are absent from their existence.  This world where Jonas lives is \\"perfect\\".  There is no crime, no war, no hatred, but there is no true love.  As 12-year-old Jonas learns more about emotions, he wants to escape.  He realizes the utopia that he lives in is really a delusion.  Murder is everywhere, yet no one realizes it.  They kill those who are deemed insufficient for their community.  Human thought is controlled and creativity doesn't exist.  This is a must read for anyone looking for a though provoking story.  Lowry does a wonderful job using her imagination to create such a world.  It makes the reader really think about the individuality within the human race.   Since the lives of the people are controlled, this book will make anybody thankful for their freedom.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed reading this book and I would definitely recommend it.  The book raises a lot of questions regarding diversity and individuality. It is a great book for the classroom since it brings up many topics for discussion.  <br />
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Despite making (sometimes major) artistic changes to these films, George Lucas' original trilogy remains one of the greatest stories of our age.  These three movies are truly a masterpiece of the magnitude of the Iliad and the Odysee for ancient Greeks.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is almost perfect, but for an old Green Day fan:    1) American idiot (4.5/5) is a return to their roots, agressive music & lyrics, punk-rock style, reminds me Insomniac.    2) Jesus Of Suburbia (5/5) Wow this is the best song on the cd and probably the best Green Day song ever. I love to play it on the guitar AMAZING!!!    3) Holiday (5/5) Great song, superb bridge, anti-war anthem!    4) BOBD (5/5) Great song, I must admit, but that's where I begin to dislike it a little. Looks to me like a major change. To much POP. If one day every Green Day song is like this one, they will loose me as a fan, because I'll get bored after 4 or 5 times.    5) Are we the waiting (4/5) Ok song, sounds like Queen a little.    6) St. Jimmy (5/5)POWER PUNK WOW I LIKE IT!    7) Give me novacaine (5/5) Old style, superb song!    8) She's a Rebel (4/5) Ok song    9) Extraordinary Girl 4.5/5 Beatles style!    10) Letterbomb (5/5) TOTALLY ROCKS!    11) WMUWSE (4/5) Second Ouch ... What's that?    12) Homecoming (5/5) I can't stop playing the Death Of St. Jimmy on my guitar    13) Whatername (5/5) What a way to end the album.    I already went to 3 AI tour show...    Toronto, Montreal & Quebec    I am going to see them again in montreal sept 4.    I just hope they will never make a cd that sounds completely like BOBD & WMUWSE.    They should sound more like JOS, Homecoming, Letterbomb, St. Jimmy, Holiday.    I don't want to listen to the same music that my mom & grandma listen to...
B00005YXZH|2.0|I bought this album based on the fine reviews it had recieved. I think this album sucks. I have tried and tried and it has never grown on me. I think OK Computer from Radiohead is one of the best albums ever made. There have been comparisons made between the two albums, and I can understand why, but for me there is no comparison. This album just does NOTHING for me.
B0000035E7|4.0|Being a big fan of Nirvana of course I bought this it is very not many people even know about this and only know of the big commercial sucess Nevermind which is great but we've got ourselves a gem here.It's very underrated.The highlights to me on this album were \\"Blew\\" and \\"About A Girl\\".So all in all it is definetly a good album and great buy.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Its amazing that its taken so long for these movies to hit DVD, and I must say that in some ways it was worth the wait, but in others I do feel a bit let down by some of the bonus features. While I loved Empire of Dreams (I had no idea the original trilogy was so frustrating for him) I had hoped that From Star Wars to Jedi would make it to the set. I also can't seem to find any deleted scenes. This doesn't mean, however, that they didn't include some of the most comprehensive making-of featurettes for this trilogy that I have ever seen, but somehow I had hoped for more.<br /> In many ways I'm suprised to see this trilogy released now, as I had originally thought that Lucas would wait until Episode 3 was released and then publish these DVDs. What's sad is his reasons for releasing them now. \\"A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now.\\" He told CNN. Kind of scary that piracy has gotten so bad that these kind of fears are out there. Can you imagine a world without the movie industry? I can't. But at least we have these movies on DVD finally!<br /> As for the films themselves, minor things have been changed and tweaked, yes. However the story remains the same as the classic trilogy. These are also the versions of the film that Lucas has declared the \\"finished\\" version. They're beautiful, vibrant, and just as entertaining as their \\"original\\" counterparts, only with better looking special effects. My honest opinion is that while the Star Wars movies may not be the greatest films of all time, they are certainly some of the most fun, and enduring titles, and whether or not Greedo shoots first isn't going to change the fact that these movies are the reason we have the great epics like Lord of the Rings and countless other amazing sci-fi and fantasy classics. This box set is a must own for movie fans of all interests. They're true classics in their own right.of all interests. They're true classics in their own right.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|1. Take Me Away &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; A rock song. <br />2. Together &#62;&#62;10/10 &#62;&#62; One of the best songs on the album.  <br />3. Don't Tell Me &#62;&#62; 8/10 &#62;&#62; It's a good song if you don't have the CD. But when you compare it to the other songs it sounds a bit weak. <br />4.

My Happy Ending &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; This is a really good song with an intersting chorus.  <br />7. Nobody's Home &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; Another slow-ish song.  <br />8. Forgotten &#62;&#62; 10/10 &#62;&#62; Best song on the album. The riffs in this song are...amazing, vocals too.  <br />9. Who Knows &#62;&#62; 9/10 &#62;&#62; Its a great song. <br />10.

Are you ready?- this is a good song. interesting sound cause it has this weird tuning. almost mid-east sounding in the beginning. really good intro song (it's called \\"Are you ready\\" so.......). song rating: 5 <br /> <br />2. What If- awesome song. just great. i think it's probably the hardest song on the album. great song. nice message. the video's cool. probably around 3rd or 4th best song on the album. song rating: 5 <br /> <br />3. Beautiful- really good song. great meaning. good all around. can't say anymore. good song. song rating: 5 <br /> <br />4. Say I- good song. doesn't really stand out a whole lot to me but it's good. but that's just me. you need to buy it inorder to see for yourself. song rating: 4 1/2 <br /> <br />5. Wrong Way- same thing as Say I, the way i go about it. good song, but doesn't stand out. song rating: 4 1/2 <br /> <br />6. Faceless Man- Best song on the record. it's all acousitcy and stuff. really good. nice and peaceful and stuff. cloudy meaning, but only you can see what it is. cool sounding. tuned as Are you ready. it really had the mid-east sound. good song. Mark Tremonti rocks! song rating: 5 <br /> <br />7. Never Die- great song. nice lyrics and meaning. good sound. song rating: 5 <br /> <br />8. With Arms Wide Open- really nice song with a good inspiration (he wrote it about his son, Jagger, when he heard that he was gonna be a dad) everything is good and well put together. i like the strings version better tho, but it's on the cd, and it's the same song so.......... song rating: 5 <br /> <br />9. Higher- good song. good good song. not the best, but it's the \\"radio song\\". in a concert, it really only fits in as an encore song (which is where they put it) catchy riffs and lyrics song rating: 5 <br /> <br />10. Wash Away Those Years- really really deep and meaningful message (listen to it, you'll see). at first it might seem to sad and stuff (it's all like flatted notes and stuff for you musicians) but that's cause it is sad. good song. song rating: 5 <br /> <br />11. Inside Us All- probably like the 2nd or 3rd best on the album. great song. great meaning. nice guitar solo (go Mark Tremonti!!) song rating: 5 <br /> <br />
B00003CXDB|5.0|Let's start with 2 definitions:    A. Economics as the rigorous analysis of incentive and utility in any social institution.  B. Game Theory as the calculus of conflict and cooperation between 2 or more parties.    Now let us take these precepts as the backdrop of a canonical film that scrutinizes the Reaganomics-fueled roaring 80s and corporate transgression and you get something called \\"Wall Street,\\" an incredible epic that works because its creator knows that business is ultimately a long game of chess.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's EVER! I'm not joking! You have to get up and get yourself a copy! If you don't, you're missing out on a great thing. Here's individual track ratings: <br />'Losing Grip'-nice rock feel, nice lyrics <br /> <br />'Complicated'-first single, good message, good lyrics <br /> <br />'Sk8er Boy'-reminds me of someone I know, some-what dancable <br /> <br />'I'm With You'-nice feel, nice lyrics <br /> <br />'Mobile'-nice <br /> <br />'Unwanted'-nice angry feel <br /> <br />'Tomorrow'-one of my two ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs on here! I LOVE THIS SONG! <br /> <br />'Anything But Ordinary'-this song is one of my theme songs, like the lyrics. Is it just me or is this song kind of like 'Soak Up the Sun'? <br /> <br />'Things I'll Never Say'-nice feel <br /> <br />'My World'-catchy beat <br /> <br />'Nobody's Fool'-I like the part where she raps <br /> <br />'Too Much To Ask'-nice and slow <br /> <br />'Naked'-one of my two ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs on here! I LOVE THIS SONG! <br /> <br />GET THIS ALBUM! <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a good Green Day CD, it probably wont blow you away, but its good. Sounds like a mix of Nimrod ballad rock songs and Warning's innovative sounds.  <br /> <br />1. American Idiot (9/10) - Everyone has heard this one, typical Green Day, but with some extra energy. <br /> <br />2. Jesus Of Suburbia (8/10) - This is the first 9 minute song, the first 2 parts (Jesus of Suburbia and City of The Damned)are awesome, especially City of the Damned, unfortunately the last three parts are solid, but forgettable, which is why this song doesn't get a 10. <br /> <br />3. Holiday (10/10) - My 2nd favorite song off the CD, and this will be the 2nd single. It is mid-tempo Green Day with a dark and political twist. Great riff, great lyrics, and the \\"hey!\\"'s are always cool. <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams (10/10) - Incredible ballad/pop rock song (very poppy). Better than Good Riddance IMO. This is the best song on this CD, it will be the 3rd single. The similarity to Avril Lavinge is a bit disturbing, but hey she wouldn't be around w/o Green Day. <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting (8.5/10) - A slow anthem-like track. I really like this one its different. <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy (8/10) - Fast paced traditional Green Day with some extra punk energy. <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novocaine (8/10) - Imagine \\"Island In The Sun\\" by Weezer mixed with \\"When I Come Around,\\" its good, just listen and you will understand :). <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel (6.5/10) - Cool, typical fast pop-punk Green Day, but it just doesn't stand out. The verses are sweet and really catchy, but the chorus lacks a real bite IMO. <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl (6/10) - Once again. its good but it doesn't stand out. It has a western feel to it, which makes it unique, but it also lacks a real hook. Probably the lowest point of the CD. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb (7/10) - A fast ballad rock pop song, Nimrod style. Its enjoyable but also lacks the catchiness expected from Green Day. But other peopleseem to like it more than me. <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends (9/10) - Back to the good stuff, a ballad in the vain of Good Riddance and Macy's Day Parade (except it has a few heavier parts). While it may trail a tiny bit behind those 2, it is still a great song. 4th single. <br /> <br />12. Homecoming (7/10) - The second 9 minute song. Not as good as Jesus of Suburbia. Like JoS, it has its good parts and the parts that lack, Mike sings in one part, or it might be Tre I forget. Anyways its pretty good but has some annoying parts (\\"nobody likes you everybody left you\\" x like 10 times) <br /> <br />13. Whatsername (7.5/10) - Another ballad-ish slower song. It's a good ender, some parts get a little tired, but it's a good song <br /> <br /> <br />Conclusion: American Idiot rocks, Green Day rocks, and Green Day will be on the scene for years to come <br /> <br />*keep in mind this is based off of 2 listens. Some songs might take time to grow on the listener.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is Christina Aguilera's best work so far! I mean, it's notable that she put a lot of dedication, hard work, and persistence on it. Obviously, she's one the most talented female vocalists out there right now, with Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston running up for the same privileged title too. Something great is that Christina is also a lyricist, composer, producer, and executive producer on STRIPPED, which makes it an even more personal work. With this, she's proving that her voice and styles are very versatile. She goes from soulful ballads (Walk Away, Impossible, Beautiful, The Voice Within, I'm OK) to hard-core rock/alternative tracks (Fighter, Make Over); from encouraging mid-tempo tunes (Cruz, Soar, Keep On Singin' My Song) to dancy Hip Hop songs (Can't Hold Us Down, Dirrty); and, from funky beats (Underappreciated, Get Mine, Get Yours) to mellow R&B and \\"flamenco\\" styles (Loving Me 4 Me, Infatuation); all that spiced up with some revealing, sexy, and peaceful interludes. Some standups in STRIPPED are obviously Beautiful (a self-esteem giver gorgeous ballad), Can't Hold Us Down (a feminist anthem featuring Lil' Kim, based on how some men, including Eminem and Fred Durst, had tried to trash her), Fighter (a rockish and hot song, maybe about how her former manager betrayed her, but how it made her stronger), Infatuation (the story of her first love, her Puerto Rican ex-boyfriend), Impossible (a remarkable ballad written, composed, arranged, and produced by Alicia Keys), Make Over (a Courtney-Love-type song where she states that she doesn't need anybody to make her over), and I'm OK (a sad story about her abusive father, produced by 4 Non Blondes' lead singer, Linda Perry). The other songs are amazing too, just that I only listed the ones with the most personal meaning for her. STRIPPED has collaborations (production, lyrics, music, vocals, etc.) of Scott Storch, Linda Perry, Matt Morris, Glen Ballard, Rob Hoffman, Heather Holley, Steve Morales, Redman, Alicia Keys, Lil' Kim, Rockwilder, Dave Navarro, Ron Fair, etc.. I highly recommend this item because I consider it as a masterpiece. Please don't doubt on buying it.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|Peter's first cd was a great start, but this one shows his growth, both vocally and as a musician, and forms a much better showcase for his enormous talents.  'On The Moon' is an apt title, since the sky's the limit for this rising star!
B000002H4Q|3.0|This would have made a great single LP. YES, I know this is only ONE compact disc. But it was originally released as a 2 album set ( in fact, one song had to be taken off - the yanked off  throw-away \\"Hey You\\" -  just to get it all on one CD.) There are just TOO many songs here, too much to digest, too much that isn't up to standard, to make this particularly worthwhile. True, there are some GREAT songs here. But for every song like \\"Catch\\" or \\"Just Like Heaven\\" there are two or three more that are uninteresting, unmemorable, and just not worth a listen. If this had been edited down to one LP, or a short cd,  this would rank as one the Cure's best. But digging through all the   fluff,  the throw-away, and the novelty songs  <br />( \\"HOT! HOT!HOT!\\"... INDEED.....it should have been called \\"NOT! NOT! NOT!\\" ) to get to the 8 or so great songs is too much effort. The closing song \\"Fight \\" is an embaressing stab at   ARENA ROCK, for God's sake. That alone should tip you off to the fact that  \\"Kiss Me...\\" is a desperate attempt to bring new meaning  to devil may care eclecticism. Or maybe they're   trying to convince their fans that they just don't give a toss. My suggestion - buy it, if you must, and burn onto one cd the best of Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me ( which is exactly what I did.)
0451196716|4.0|Having read Stephen King since junior high in the late 70s (gosh I feel old), I wasn't surprised at the unique plot (100 boys set out on a walking contest and only one will finish alive) or the writing style (matter of fact, direct, a love for Maine and Americana) or the characters (some normal, some crazy, some perhaps from another world), but I was surprised at the ending. Obtuse comes to mind. I suppose after a few re-readings it will become clearer. In some part of my mind, I was afraid it would end this way, and after reading the last word, I felt kinda sick to my stomach. But that's King for you. Sometimes he ends logically and sometimes he gives you something to really think about -- things you were hoping he wouldn't address -- things that you'd rather NOT think about.
B000002HPV|4.0|This is my favourite Bjork cd, I go back to it time and time again. It hasn't got that stamp of age on it that her Debut has ( which STILL  sounds for the most part like half-baked club music ) nor does it have the desperate everything-goes approach  of Post. This is meant to listen to all the way through, and it makes for an exhilerating 45 minute journey. The ONLY thing for me that keeps this from a 5 star, perfect rating, is the fact that I like the single mix of All Is Full Of Love ( one of her best songs ever ) rather than the version found here. The cover, by the way, is absolutely  disturbing.
0679720200|4.0|This book is a ponderous, uninspiring read, but it presents a meaningful message. People who feel alienated, bewildered, and detached in an indifferent universe will recognize parallels with their own experiences.  If you sing in the Choir, this book is an apostasy, a blight on an orderly world. <br /> <br />The fortunate many, whose belief in transcendence nestles their hearts in warmth and certainty will be impatient with a heathen who floats unanchored by conventional values and social mores.  If you are religious, mans' every action is birthed within the context of rational cause and effect.  <br /> <br />Meursault does not have the guidance that organized religion provides.  He has not internalized the rules, the guidelines that create conscience, guilt about what he does or does not do. He is freefloating in the universe. <br /> <br />Yes, he does inexplicable things; things that are inexplicable if you expect a rational explanation.  Things happen in the context of the moment - he puts 4 shots into the Arab when the first shot probably killed him. Why? We don't know. As humans, we are uncomfortable with that answer; we must have an answer and where there a void we will fill it in with...something. He did it because... <br /> <br />If you are an atheist, you can relate, at an emotional level with Meursault's experiences. But it goes beyond religion; Meursault did not grieve over the death of his mother. In our society everyone loves their mother (see Philip Wylie's Generation of Vipers).  What if your mother never showed you any love, physical affection, or caring? What if your relationship with her was indifferent? <br /> <br />This book is about the \\"benign indifference of the universe.\\" As such, it is not an enjoyable or fulfulling book. It may be cathartic, perhaps clensing for some. For many who don't know who they are, where they come from, or where they are going this book offers a small reprieve. <br /> <br />
B000002H70|5.0|This album still sounds great. I had the cassette when it came out, listened to it until the tape hissed, then got the cd. I still listen to the second half quite frequently. Prayers for Rain and The Same Deep Water as You are two of the most intense, personal songs Robert Smith has ever written - amazing, in that they are both ballads, and both well over five minutes long. It just goes to show, musical intensity has nothing to do with tempo. A song doesn't have to \\"rock out\\" to grip you. This one is best listened to with a good set of headphones, the sound draws you in, completely envelopes you, and opens itself up, revealing layer upon layer of instruments and voices. Although I like the songs on Pornography album better  than this one, the performance,  the recording, the production and mixing make this a much better artistic statement. Probably their best overall.
B0001KO9QA|5.0|I can't believe I've had this set (Star Wars Trilogy: Special Letterbox Collector's Edition) for 10 years.  I just looked at the receipt and noticed I bought it in 1994!  Although this set is in VHS format, YES, this is the original trilogy -- no new added scenes, no added laser fire (i.e. Greedo didn't shoot first), no Luke screaming down the shaft, etc. <br /> <br />This is the original trilogy as seen in the theatres when first released.  The only thing different would be the \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\" added to the Star Wars crawl.   <br /> <br />The image is not fully restored and the sound isn't crisply digital -- and I love it that way!  I've only occasionally watched these tapes because I bought the 1997 Special Editions and now the DVDs.  And no, I'm not selling!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore's expos of the corruption and incompetence of the Bush administration may be a bit of a shock to those who depend on the corporate media for their news, but it is mostly accurate, although some minor details are omited or blurred (Moore mentions that Bush sat dumbfounded in the classroom for 7 minutes after being informed of the attacks, and the video of him sitting was indeed 7 minutes, but the timeline of the day shows that Bush stayed at the school for over 30 minutes after Card informed him of the attack, putting himself and all the kids in the school in unnecessary danger.  Anyway, the film is at times humorous, often moving, and truly patriotic. <br />For progressives and political junkies, this flick will not show you anything you don't already know, but it will give you an entertaining look at what is in fact a pretty grim administration.
B0002Y4TZG|4.0|This is a great package with the original album, an extended booklet with essays and photos, a single disc of demos, and a DVD.<br /><br />Twenty-five years after its release, the album itself is no mystery. London Calling is a timeless classic. Even today, it stills sounds fresh, lively, and relevant. Not many other records from the late 70's and 1980's can make this claim. The band pushes way beyond its punk roots, yet still keeps a sharp political edge to the lyrics.<br /><br />The demos disc is an interesting document of early versions of the songs and a powerful way to hear the influence of Guy Stevens on the final product. Casual fans or shallow listeners probably won't see the value of the demos, but anybody with a passion for the creative process will find a lot of cool moments on the second disc. Collectors and big fans will also enjoy a batch of unreleased songs, including a Dylan cover and a run-through of Remote Control.<br /><br />The other stuff in the package is good but not great. The booklet feels like it was a bit of an afterthought. A reprint of the original album sleeves, with lyrics and photos, is nice to have. The DVD is mostly interesting for including footage of the band in the studio--you can see for yourself how crazy Guy Stevens was--and videos for London Calling, Train in Vain, and Clampdown.<br /><br />So, 4 stars. A better booklet and more live footage on the DVD would make it 5 stars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|What differentiates Green Day from every other punk band that has ever been is that they are all excellent musicians and with this release Billie Joe Armstrong solidifies himself as a top notch song writer.  Sure the whole band is credited in the liner notes but Billie is the true force behind this epic release.  Some eschew Green Day as nothing more then a pop-punk band.  This is small thinking in my opinion.  The bottom line is it is just a great rock CD from a great band.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|A riveting movie, with some rough spots, but overall, a thoughtful, deliberate and successful story.  It's a slice of working class life in a working class town, where there is no escaping the past.  Only in a town like this, as opposed to a big city, would the three friends at the center of the story, live in the same place and reminisce about the same things they did a generation ago.  There are so many conflicting themes, including a wife who does not give her husband the support a wife should provide, and prior friendships seem to dissolve in spite of themselves.  And at the end, the morality of actions beg the question of  . . is a painful life worth living.  Do things always turn out with some kind of poetic justice, and how is good and bad defined with respect to each other.
B00003CXCT|5.0|all of you who prefer the original versions are just nostalgic.  this is the way it is, live with it.  if this dvd release is so bad, then what the hell is good?  the answer would be nothing. <br /> <br />and the guy who was complaining about the appearance of hayden christensen and not ewan mcgregor... i believe this was done the way it was done because the spirit was meant to show the true anakin skywalker, the good man.  that good man was almost completely wiped out in episode 3.  so when the ghost appears, it looks like how the true anakin skywalker last appeared.  obi wan was still a great man at the time of his death, so he appears as alec guinness.  that's all i got. <br /> <br />anyway, buy these discs, the special features are great, and whoever was bitching about sloppy transfers is full of it.  drop the $42 now.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION was the second straight classic that MEGADETH made. When I found out it was being remasted and remixed, I traded in my entire MEGADETH collection and bought all of the reissues. I have already reviewed the new RIP, and I can say that I am also happy with this version. The sounds are clearer and crisper. This version sound more metal than the original. Dave proved to the world that he would not be overshadowed by METALLICA and this album proves it. I totally dig the new version of SWEATING BULLETS. The beginning sounds heavier and I like that. If you havent listened to this album before, than I suggest you get this version, crank the stereo to 10 and just bang away. I think the first five songs: SKIN O MY TEETH, SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE OF AGGRESSION, FORCLOSURE OF A DREAM, BULLETS just will blow you away. The bonus tracks are cool as are the liner notes from Dave. If you want to know what real metal sounds like, get this album now
B00003CXCT|4.0|This is hands-down, quite simply, the greatest release in dvd history.....so far anyway (we all know theres more Star Wars coming). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was not a completely comprehensive set with the most comprehensive features possible (Lucas is holding out on that for the future). For what it is, and what it encompasses, no other set available can touch it, especially in the sound and picture department. Now, to address the Special Editions ('97 and 04') vs. The Originals:1. First, these movies are made by and are the property of GEORGE LUCAS. As the creator, maker, and owner they are his to do what he wishes just as is the right of any creator, maker, and owner of anything. Its a level playing field people, any other filmmaker has the same rights to his/her films. Lets not throw sour grapes because he chose to exercise his rights, even if no one else does. Besides, his intentions were no mystery. He said it way back in the seventies and eighties that he was disappointed with how the trilogy turned out and that only about 25% of his vision had been realized due to technological limitations. Follow these thoughts to conclusion and we all knew what was coming. 2. The changes he made make sense and are necessary! As soon as Lucas decided to begin making the prequel trilogy in the 90's a situation which never before occurred in cinema history occurred. Someone was making films to show what happened decades before the events of the existing stories. Yes, Lucas invented the prequel. For the first time a trilogy of films made long ago came chronologically long-after a trilogy of films about to be made. Obviously things had to be done to maintain continuity throughout. Shouldn't Palpatine be the same actor from beginning to end? Of course, especially the same gender. Bobba Fett's voice should be identical to Jango's considering they are clones of each other whether the voice is as \\"cool\\" or not. Now the big one, the moment Anakin became Vader he ceased to be the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. Kenobi says it right in Return of the Jedi. Therefore when this event occurrs in Episode III, the Force spirit of Anakin, remains at that point in time. He is a young man. This is why we see him as Hayden at the end of Return of the Jedi because he is redeemed and on the Light side again as the Jedi he once was. If he died unredeemed as Vader Im sure we would see something quite different as his spirit stands on the Dark side with Palpatine, Dooku, and Darth Maul. So this change too makes sense. Its all part of consistent and proper story telling as any good story teller, no less filmmaker, will know.      3. Finally, the question we need to ask ourselves, sentimentallity aside, is \\"Do the changes Lucas made really change the story at all?\\" The answer is NO, if anything, they enhance the story and clear up problems with the finer details. There arent any characters that do anything radically different or out of character given what we already know. No one lives when they originally died and no one dies when they originally lived. No characters are scrapped from films they were once in, the actors are made consistent throughout now. People fell in love with Star Wars for the characters and the stories their lives tell, that remains the same and thats whats important to remember.....not whether Han or Greedo shoots first.      So, if what you fell in love with about the trilogy was the characters and their story go out and buy this set!     One last cathartic note, leave the Ewoks alone already. Lets stop with the \\"cute teddy bear bashing\\". In films there are metaphors told through characters. Godzilla was a metaphor for the bombing of Hiroshima and The Blob was a metaphor for McCarthyism. The Ewoks are a metaphor for the simple, unsophisticated, technologically unadvanced defeating the technologically, superior super-power because they got arrogant and careless.     Its a deep statement shown in a simple, cute way, so you dont even realize it unless you think about it. We live in a time where people dont want to think while theyre \\"being entertained\\" anymore. Thats why we live in a society where \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" can be #1 at the box office when 25 years or more ago such things never saw screen time.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I wrote a review for the original and in that review I stated that on RUST IN PEACE, MEGADETGH finally stepped out of METALLICAS shadow. I still think this is one of the 10 greatest metal albums of all time. When I found out it was being remastered with bonus tracks, I traded in my complete MEGADETH collection and went out and got all of the new issues. This album sounds more brutal, more ass-kicking, more metal than the first one. The sound is great, in my opinion this remaster makes a classic album even better. Now I've read how some of the reviewers dont like how the vocals have been redone on some songs, and to be honest I didnt even notice the lyrical changes. You are entitiled to like or dislike what you want. If you never heard the original, than I suggest you sit back, crank up the stereo and listen to\\"  HANGER 18, HOLY WARS...PUNISHMENT DUE, TORNADO OF SOULS, TAKE NO PRISONERS.  Just sit back and crank the whole album, you will not be disaapointed.
B000002JSN|5.0|What? This was just made up of demos? Wow, then that makes this album and Zep even better! This is easily the best album of the seventies if not the best album of all time, well actually I think Nirvana's 'In Utero' is better but hey thats my opinion. This album is chock full of classic, unforgetable songs like 'Kashmir', 'Houses of the Holy' and especially 'In My Time of Dying' which in my opinion was Leds best song. 'In my time of dying' has two unforgettable solos by Jimmy Page and has that classic drumline that you can never forget, it also has an awesome bassline by none other than John Paul Jones and need I say anything about Robert Plants voice? I dont think I should since it always sounds great. Another masterpiece is 'Ten Years Gone', at first I thought it was about poor Robert losing his son Karac (RIP) but then I realized that he lost Karac in '76 when this came out in '75. This song is truly amazing and if you hear it the wrong way it could be a tear jerker, but if you hear it the way its supposed to be heard then you will know that its one of the greatest Zeppelin songs ever made. Hell this album IS Zeppelins best album (I think I said that already) and its definately worth your hard earned cash. Now here are the order of Zeps best studio albums: <br />1. Physical Graffiti 15/10 <br />2. Led Zeppelin II 12/10 <br />3. Led Zeppelin IV 10/10 <br />4. Led Zeppelin III 10/10 <br />5. Houses of the Holy 10/10 <br />6. Led Zeppelin I 9/10 <br />7. In Through the Out Door 8/10 <br />8. Presence 6.5/10
B00003CXCT|5.0|Does George Lucas need more money? Does he think that he is going to convince anyone by adding ghosts or dinosaurs to the original film? I know he thinks he must add effects so the \\"new generations\\" appreciate his old films more... WRONG, I am 17 and I hate the changes he made to the trilogy, not to mention adding the wrongly-chosen young anaking (Hayden C.) to the EPIC Return of the Jedi...It pisses me off,,, on e thing is restoration, you see that everyday in art, other thing (very bad) is change, you wouldn't like if they added a PERFECT LOOKING COMPUTER GENERATED hair clip to Da Vinci's Monalisa... Would You?. I think that in the 20 years that passed between the two generations of SW, he didn't really sit down and write a good story, like he had done fot IV-V-VI, he just tried to adapt what he thought people would like to see from the old fiilms, and load it in his computers, leaving time and substance HOLES between the two generations. Don't get me wrong, I like the new episodes, but they definitively don't do justice to the old ones, and as I told you, I am 17 years old, so \\"new generation\\" tastes are no reason (unless you just want money) to keep you from doing good movies, and to keep ART being and ART, not a money machine. If you like starwars, buy the THX VHS edition, without all the makeup and changes of the Special Edition, and YES, without Hayden on the ROTJ...This is my honest opinion, THANX
B000060P79|1.0|I'm terribly sorry with all my heart, these guys are anything but punk. When I saw the video for 'Perfect' it was clear to me that their main audience target was 11 - 13 year old poseur girls who think that dying their hair and showing up a minute late to class makes them bad. I hate people like that, especially the ones who provoke them...like Simple Plan for example. These guys target poseur girls and feminine g@y boys because those are the only people that they can relate to. This is one of the biggest disgraces that I have ever had the misfortune to listen too.I'm sure five billion more people can relate to me than not and those who cant relate are either A. POSEURS!!, B. Fake rebels, trying to get attention and fail miserably, or C. MTV obsessors, if you are either you really need your head examined. Maybe its because I'm a metalhead...wait no its not because I really like some nonmetal bands like Nirvana, Green Day, Sex Pistols, Ramones and more...in fact Nirvana is my favorite band (yes I am a metalhead). This album is an utter disaster.  <br />  <br />Caution: FOR POSEURS ONLY
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|It doesn't get any better than Musiquarium I when you are talking about all of the albums and #1 hits that this musical geniuos has done in the past few decades. He should be a role model to all musicians period regardless to whichever musical background that they come from. I am 34 yrs old and remember listening to Stevie since grade school. My hats off to Amazon for allowing myself and countless others to be able to go back in time and purchase whatever we choose whenever we want 24-7.  <br /> <br />Regard, <br />CBG
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris has a long career of making interesting documentaries, and with The Fog of War we become privy to the thoughts of Robert McNamara, JFK's Secretary of Defense and one of the primary architects of the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Illustrating his \\"ten lessons\\" are McNamara's observations on WW2, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War.  Morris inserts thought-provoking images and Philip Glass's score is, as always, haunting and evocative.<br /><br />I know a fair bit about our country's wars, but still found new revelations here, as well as chilling parallels to our own generation's Iraq War -- the beginnings based on faulty information and assumptions, the escalation, etc.<br /><br />DVD extras include additional scenes, McNamara's ten lessons and LBJ's infamous countdown ad.  The film can be heard in English with optional subtitles in Japanese, French, Spanish or Portuguese.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day took the world by storm when \\"Dookie\\" was released in 1994. They forever changed the sound of Punk and Pop/Punk music to come. In 1995 they released \\"Insomniac\\", a high energy back-to-the-roots record, losing much of their MTV/radio fan base, but creating a true underground cult following for their records to come. In 1997 they changed it up again, with \\"Nimrod\\". Again, pushing the limits beyond their standard sound and creating something different. After a three year break, they released the highly underrated Kinks-inspired \\"Warning\\" in 2000; probably the biggest change to their sound up until now.<br /><br />\\"American Idiot\\" works in many way like The Who's rock operas \\"Tommy\\" and \\"A Quick One (While He's Away)\\". Billy Joe Armstrong's politically fueled lyrics are very reminiscent of The Clash. Although this record is fueled by plenty of hard hitting influences, it stands on it's own as an original piece of punk rock opera. Green Day has been developing their own sound for several years now; personalizing themselves with their fans. \\"Warning\\" proved to be an impressive step in maturing musically and lyrically. But \\"American Idiot\\" has surpassed the maturity of \\"Warning\\" in a wide array, capturing the true essence of Armstrong's anger, heartbreak, and disillusionment displayed in his unapologetic lyrics that convey the feelings of American's and life after 9/11.<br /><br />\\"American Idiot\\" combines several styles of music that is unmatched by any other Green Day record. It's amazing how a band like Green Day can take your standard three-chord sound and revive it, making it sound fresh each time. They mix it up with chimes, bongos, piano, sound effects and non three-chord guitar rhythms and solos. This is by far Green Day's most progressive effort to date. The music's time changes very rapidly, drifting in and out of hardcore punk rock directly into soft melodic acoustic settings. The harmony on this record is breathtaking, never seeming dull.<br /><br />Green Day raises the bar once again, proving that their prime hasn't past, starting a new revolution in punk. They weren't destine to be in the spotlight of fame their whole career. They were destine to change punk rock as we know it. They are pioneers that have proven themselves time and time again. Every record they make gets better and better. \\"American Idiot\\" is somewhat of a masterpiece with long lasting power. There is a lot to absorb on this record that may not sink in after one or two listens. It is a multi-faceted undertaking that is unmatched in music history.br />Green Day raises the bar once again, proving that their prime hasn't past, starting a new revolution in punk.

B0002S94OS|5.0|This is by far more listenable than the last album but maintains the ferociousness of the first one. Another winner with slayer like riffing and speed change ups and harmonies !! <br /> <br />Highlights are \\"Laid to Rest\\" , \\"Now You've Got something to Die For\\" (briliant starting riff!), \\"The Faded Line\\" ( another cool cacophony of guitar speed riffing (simple but cool witht he drumming), \\"Omerta\\" and \\"Break You\\". <br /> <br />If you like Slayer, and throughty voices this is your album ! <br /> <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is a breath of fresh air for musicians, singers, and even listeners.  His unique blend of soul, jazz, and rock has affected me personally as a performer and songwriter.  There is always the search for the perfect lyrics, but as seen in many of Gavin's songs, he was just being himself; writing what he was comfortable with and genuine.  This album is superior and will affect people in ways that even Gavin will not be able to fathom.  However, there is one album that is better, and that is \\"Stripped.\\"  This album breaks it all down and exposes Gavin at his finest.  The raw talent demonstrated is unlike any other.  The emotion infused into every song, and the tightness of the band gives this album a step above the rest. I can't say enough good things about these albums except that I have been affected as a writer and musician.
B00006JJ51|3.0|I relistened to 'Straight Outta Compton' and was grinning ear-to-ear only because NWA's gangsta-rap landmark is just as aggressive, just as angry, just as brazen as ear-piercing genres like punk or metal. The only difference being that NWA are able to pull it of with the rhythm, raunchy cheekiness, and musical sensibility of hip-hop. 'Straight Outta Compton' paints a picture of thug realism that's brutally honest and harsh at the sametime. Laced with profanity, graphic violence, and sexual explicit lyrics, such is the reality of living in the hood. It's not a pretty picture. Musically NWA is less dense and frenzied than their old-school counterparts Public Enemy, opting for a more minimalistic sound, yet packing a powerful punch with it's hypnotic bass/beat accents. Funky hip-hop rhythms/samples, trancelike and intense, acting as a soundtrack for ganglife realism. An old-school classic that's seeping with defiance and confrontation, a recording that can only make you smile at it's gutless swagger regardless if you're a fan of hip-hop or not. 'Straight Outta Compton' continues to endure only because struggling is a universal theme, speaking-out against inequality        is a universal theme, and surviving is a universal theme.
B00005OC06|3.0|This DVDis hampered by a distractingly poor, kitchy production.  Although, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle was a well liked director, especially during the 1970s when this was filmed, he almost ruins this DVD with outdated and misguided directing and editing.  The sets are generally tolerable but the costumes and make-up are unattractive and borderline silly.  Worst is the general directing and editing, which culminate at the end of the last act when a t-shirted Domingo jumps through a shoji screen to be freeze-framed in mid-air: a final example of Ponnelle's misguided attempts at drama. <br /> <br />Musically, the cast is superb.  Domingo is in strong voice and an ideal Pinkerton, despite being a bit clumsy an actor under Ponnelle's direction.  Freni fares much better as an actress, and is overall a lovely Butterfly, despite a few harsh notes.  Karajan leads the orchestra wonderfully, rounding out an overall strong and compelling interpretation of Puccini's score. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the poor production leads one to enjoy listening to the DVD more than watching it.  As such, until a better DVD of Butterfly is released, it may pay to just stick with audio recordings and forego the visuals which distract from the beauty of these fine musical artists' interpretations of one of opera's greatest scores. <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|One thing I don't get is how this movie can receive bad reviews!!?? The storyline was very unique and not hard to follow at all as long as you pay attention to it. I never really cared for Jim Carry before, but this film changed my view of him and now he is one of my favorite actors. Kate Winslet's performance was excellent as well. All the actors in this film are right on target and do a great job. I don't think anyone else could have pulled this movie off besides Michel Godry and the creative Charlie Kaufman. This film is defiantly a work of art and visually stunning. This is my favorite movie of all time, it was the most different and like I said before unique movie of all time, and EVERYONE should see it! Its sad that all the good movies like this that makes you think and change some perspectives get semi ignored, and movies like \\"Honey\\" and \\"You got served\\" get  everyone going to it.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I personly liked this album. It was good. Different, and catchy. This by far is not a punk album. It's somewhat punk, but mainly just rock. They have slowed down a lot as a band. American Idiot and St. Jimmy are the two main punk song. The rest are mainly just catchy melodic rock/ pop-punk songs. Fans of good old Dookie and Insomniac will be dissapointed cause this album is slower and not as punky. But harcore Greenday fans like me will love it. It's got great catchy melody. And good political lyrics. This album will be liked by a lot of new punk fans, like the girls who like Simple Plan, and Blink 182, and sellout bands. But this album might not be appreciated by hard core punk heads who like Dookie, and old school punk like NOFX. Me! I like it all except Simple Plan. I apprecciated hard core punk the best like Rancid. But this is a good laid back album, for like doing home work, and it's got variety. Overall it's a good album for Greenday fans. Listen to it if a friend has it before you buy it to make sure you like it.
B0000029DD|2.0|Gratuitous and specious are words that come to mind while parsing this album.  The only worthwhile song was written by L. Cohen (Hallelujah), and Buckley did an excellent job with it.  The rest were written by Buckley, and are regrettable.
0790746905|5.0|Forbidden Planet is on my short list of greatest Sci/Fi-Horror films of all time. It featured a plot that was far more sophisticated and thoughtful than most movies today, some impressive (for the 1950's) set designs and special effects, and a really weird score. I remember after seeing it as a child, having nightmares about being chased down long, empty corridors by the \\"invisible except when exposed to an electrical field\\" Lion-headed creature from the film (Alright, I know we were more easily frightened by movies back then, but there was just something creepy about that thing!). I am actually surprised, given the fact that so many mediocre films and T.V. shows are routinely remade (Scooby-Doo?), that nobody has taken a crack at this classic. In the right hands (Ridley Scott would be a good choice),a remake could be quite a hit.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan since, well since they originated!  They've never displeased me, and \\"American Idiot\\" well it kicks some major ass!  I heard the cd way before it came out and it captured my emotions the first listening.  Holiday is definitely a single that will capture people and take them to a higher place.  Its tunes, and lyrics are out of this world.  The rest of the cd is awesome too.  Don't wait any longer, get off your butt and go buy this CD!!!!  GREEN DAY RULES!!!
B0002OERI0|4.0|American Idiot is a great album. You can easily listen to this album from start to finish without skipping any of the tracks.  However you may be tempted to on Extraordinary Girl but thats really it. It has a sound similiar to that of the first half on Nimrod except the lyrics are more like Warning in that they are more of a social and politicaly commentary. The album does run at about 57 min plus, and as a with just about every \\"(punk)rock opera\\" the plot is inconistant, and the seperation of character is often a little weak.  You usually dont know which character is currently the focal point until their name comes out.  Now as for the names its what you would expect Billie Joe to come with(given the new political edge)Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, Whatsername, and the briefly mentioned ol Whatshisface.  Now while the plot problems are forgiven for the most part becuase it is the nature of the beast when attempting an rock opera, the only thing that keeps it away from 5 stars is that I dont go to Green Day for political commentary (same with the Beastie Boys though Green Day dont go nearly as extreme,)what I want to hear from GD is clever songs about apathy, angest, and the other things that they are known for.  While (like Blink) every band has to a mature however the direction of GDs apparent maturation is one that I will forgive them because of the album being released during an election year.  Ultimatly it is very worth buying, and while politically inclined (to the left) the lyrics are catchy and have the sing-a-long and hook natured appeal as always. So now that you have been informed as to of what to expect its on you to decided whether or not you fork over the $14 for it (I however did spent $25 on the limited ed. which I recommend if you can find it.)
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Ashton Kutcher show a dramatic side in this thrilling movie. His father was institutionalizedwhen people thought he was insane, but whatever mental disorder he had he passed to his son. <br /> As a kid, Ashton's character blacked out a lot and no one knew why. He then goes years without a single one, and everything comes back to him. Just by remembering a certain specific day in his past he can re live it, and change it. But with dire consequences every time. <br /> I founf this movie riveting, brilliantly written and well acted-out. A different side to the 70's Show invalid!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Yet again more changes have been made to the once great films: <br /> <br />What's Been Changed? <br />The rumors are true: Lucas made more changes to the films for their DVD debut. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has been added to a scene in Jedi, Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) replaces Clive Revill with slightly revised lines in Empire, Temuera Morrison has rerecorded Boba Fett's minimal dialogue, and some other small details have been altered. Yes, these changes mean that the Star Wars films are no longer the ones you saw 20 years ago, but these brief changes hardly affect the films, and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies. It's not like a digitized Ewan McGregor has replaced Alec Guiness's scenes, and the infamous changes made for the 1997 special-edition versions were much more intrusive (of course, those are in the DVD versions as well). <br /> <br />Why George Why!?

B00005JKG9|5.0|Playwright David Mamet certainly has something to say about the art of selling with \\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\\" and the overall statement isn't good. I don't have a clue as to what his background was before he struck it big in the entertainment biz, but I suspect Mamet either worked in sales himself or had a family member who went through a similar experience. How else could he capture perfectly the seedy underbelly of boiler room scam artists? Because \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is first and foremost a story about real estate scam artists trying to con a buck out of the average Joe. I think many viewers forget this point. It's disheartening to see so many people take the lessons of this film and apply them to all sales jobs. For example, my father worked as a salesman for his entire career and never experienced anything remotely resembling the horrors seen in the film. On the other hand, everyone has dealt at one time or another with a salesman who just cannot accept \\"no\\" for an answer. So in some respects, \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" rings true even as it exaggerates for dramatic impact. Regardless, the film version of Mamet's play is a fascinating experience.<br /><br />Spirits are low in a branch office of Mitch & Murray, a shady real estate concern that sells properties of dubious value to anyone with a few grand in a savings account. The office is a cauldron of seething resentments as the salesman grind away day after day to seal that elusive deal that will translate into one more day on the job. You've got Shelley \\"The Machine\\" Levene (Jack Lemmon), an old timer who once ruled the roost but has since fallen into a dry spell that leaves him wondering about his job on a minute by minute basis. Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) has superseded Shelley as the new lion, a young, spiffy, silver-tongued con artist with the ability to rack up sale after sale. Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), both peripheral figures in the larger scheme of the office, have their own problems. Aaronow too has hit a dry spell, and Moss spends so much time complaining about the lousy job that he barely has time to go out and sell. Presiding over this insane asylum is office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), a smarmy, by the book type despised by the others because he has never sold a darn thing in his life.<br /><br />Then Blake (Alec Baldwin) struts into the branch office, and what was once a pressure cooker of a job shifts into a primal struggle for survival. Swaggering, brash, insulting Blake announces a new contest for these poor wretches. They will, announces Blake, clear out all of their old \\"leads\\" (cards filled in by potential customers and mailed to the company) before receiving a shot at the fresh, exciting Glengarry leads. The salesman who closes the most deals wins a new Cadillac. Second place is a box of steak knives. Everyone else gets a pink slip. Even worse, Blake threatens, he swears, he impugns the salesmen's manhood; he does everything he can possibly think of to motivate these guys to hit the street and sell. After all, he made nearly a million dollars closing these leads, so anyone who falls below his stellar record is dirt on his shoes. With their very jobs hanging in the balance, the office rapidly disintegrates into chaos and pure panic. Only Roma racks up a sell, to the odd James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce), but even that potentially falls apart in the end. Levene nearly has a nervous breakdown trying to save his skin, a breakdown fueled by the thought of his daughter's desperately needed operation. Some of the salesmen try to bribe Williamson into giving them the Glengarry leads; others plot to steal them out of Williamson's office. You won't figure out how this film ends in a million years.<br /><br />I'm finding it difficult to write about this movie largely because the film lives and breathes through its characters. \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is all about dialogue slathered with a generous helping of profanity and rage fueled rants. It's what goes on behind the dialogue that makes the movie a winner. Mamet sets up this Catch-22 situation (the salesman can't get the good leads until they sell the bad leads, but it's impossible to sell the bad leads) in order to examine the damaging aspects of the \\"sell, sell, sell,\\" all or nothing mentality on the human psyche. The despair etched in the faces of these men, who will probably never find another job if they lose this one, speaks louder than the set pieces or even most of the mundane dialogue. Sure, a lot of these rants are hilarious in and of themselves, but there's a raging desperation behind them that puts a damper on the giggles. Isn't there something fundamentally wrong about a business strategy that drives men to consider stealing in order to protect not only their jobs but also their sense of self? You bet there is, and that is the point Mamet drives home in \\"Glengarry Glen Ross.\\"<br /><br />You get a bunch of extras on these two discs. An audio commentary, a short \\"Always Be Closing\\" documentary on selling, a tribute to Jack Lemmon, clips from \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" and \\"Inside the Actor's Studio,\\" and a bunch of other goodies should keep you watching long after the movie ends. What I discovered most from watching these extras had little to do with the movie, surprisingly, but the realization that Peter Gallagher is one of the most annoying people on the planet (watch the Lemmon tribute to see why). No review will do this monument to modern American business justice-just watch the movie and experience it for yourself.d rants. It's what goes on behind the dialogue that makes the movie a winner.

B000286RNY|5.0|First off, the movie is about an ex-soccer player--who was permanently wounded when he was younger--that wants to coach his own soccer team.  He finds an enthusiastic guy who's alias is Steel Leg; this guy is one of five Shaolin Kung Fu students who really wants to incorporate what they learned with a popular thing in order to make it popular.  The main plot focuses on getting the team together then entering a championship that's worth $1 million to them if they win. <br /> <br />What was so great about Shaolin Soccer is that the story was captivating.  You just are pulled into it.  There's humor, drama, and even a drop of romance.  The special effects were amazing--not in a new way, but how uniquely they used it (Imagine using The Matrix type of FX in a comedy).  The comedy was varied:  satirical, physical, stupid, etc.  There's even a few short song numbers and one dance number (copied, respectively, from MJ's \\"Thriller\\").  There are wonderful camera angles and such, too. <br /> <br />Of course, it wasn't perfect.  Some of the editing was bad, and a few gags were repetitious.  The US version seemed to do well for those parts, but they also took out some very wonderful gags that only make the Chinese version better.  Since I mention the US version I'd like to say this:  the dubbing is like usual dubbed Chinese films (you won't like it as much).  Also, only watch it if you're in the mood to compare the two versions--I watched both versions back to back.  Another thing, and it's more to do with the dvd, is that the Chinese version's sections that are cut out of the US version aren't dubbed (i.e. scene of \\"explosion\\" to dance where the guy talks, but no words are up to hear it). <br /> <br />Overall, I loved this movie. <br />+ Wonderful special effects and action <br />+ Encapturing story <br />+ Awesome variety of humor <br />+ Beautiful cinematography <br />- A few unneeded repetitious gags <br />- Chinese version edited too little (US's edited too much) <br />? Where are the captions? <br />? What, no extras besides both editions? <br /> <br />Closing thoughts:  If you enjoyed the creativity of Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but thought either the story lacked or the action was uninteresting, you'll definitely find an interest in Shaolin Soccer.  You should at least view it once whenever you get the chance.  It's definitely worth buying even if there are no extras on it. 4.9/5__(Movie) 4.6/5__(Dvd)
0142437611|5.0|This work is perhaps the most perfect Bellow of all. It is the story of Tommy Wilhelm a divorced father of two, a former actor , a self- perceived failure as he puts his life bit of money and trust in the truthteller- imposter Dr. Temkin. But the work also catches perfectly the idiom of West Side New York American business life, of a civilization money- driven. It is a richly ironic work with brilliant portraits of minor characters. It tells convincingly of the heartbreak of middle - aged disappointment in a success- measuring civilization. And it does this with a depiction of its central character which is always deep and moving. The book comes to its end in a funeral scene in which self- pitying Wilhelm ( Wilky) mourns with all his soul for himself, and leads us to mourn for him, and for each and every frail mortal who has known most deeply their own failure. What a richness of Yiddish- American idiom and truth of life there is in this compact and beautiful work.

0786868694|5.0|This has become a very inspiring book for me that somehow gives legitimization to homey, comforting needs and the never accomplished wish for a perfect world... A perfect world cannot be ever achieved so a minor solution is to create a little perfection in the kitchen, a little sanctuary from the outside world.... This was the message of the book for me if it does not sound ridiculous to talk about a cook book message.  Nigela Lawson herself does not use the word perfection but instead talks about cooking what suits you. All she wants is to give you new ideas for easier cooking, new ideas to experiment with and suggestions to cooking things you never thought about (do not tell me you ever thought about cooking Ham in Coca-Cola). I know there is a very clear-cut division between the admirers and the haters of Nigela Lawson. I myself have never heard about this woman before reading the book so it was a very \\"fresh\\" experience that got me hooked and curious to watch her on television. The book is a pleasure to read and I have to confess I read it in bed for the first time. The book gives you some life philosophy besides the recipes and the added value comes with the many beautiful pictures that are a pleasure and inspiration. I also confess that maybe the life philosophy and the recipes suit someone like myself who \\"lives to eat\\" and not the other way around and is ready to work a little for this goal. Nigela Lawson makes an effort to make the recipes as easy as possible, she uses several tips and tells you when you can skip a stage, but nevertheless it should be clear that with most recipes some work is involved.  <br />As to the recipes themselves. So far I have tried 5 recipes. Four of them came out outstanding and these include the amazing chocolate fudge cake, and the soft and spicy invaltini eggplants, which have become a cornerstone of my kitchen. I also loved Grandma Lawson pastry and the Union Square spicy nuts. The fifth recipe (liftower dip) was surprisinglybanal. However, I am still on my first stages and have marked the Ham and Coca-Cola-cola as a must.  <br /> <br />

B000286S8S|5.0|(...)  As far as the new songs go, I like them all.  \\"It's About Time\\" isn't just ironic, as some of you have been saying.  Sammy wrote it for us, even if he only had a week or whatever to finish it.  \\"Were gonna make it up to you, big big time\\" or something, I can't recall the exact lyrics at the moment.  Listen to it, he's talking to the fans.    \\"Up for Breakfest\\" ...Hmm..Sammy, you're 56, it's time to stop thinking like a 16 year old.  But then again, if my life was like the song, then maybe I'd get up for breakfast too.    \\"Learning to See\\" is pretty good.  Not a real rocker, more of a bring-me-down.  Still, lyrically, makes some good points.  How many of us have our eyes wide open, but still never see?      I saw Van Halen in concert on their current tour, and I can honestly say, that if you go see them, you will forget about Dave.  There is no more Sammy vs. Dave crap, it's just Sammy.  And it's not Van Hagar, it's Van Halen.  They finally got it right, so stop your complaining.
B000001FA4|5.0|For my 1000th review, I wanted to review an album that really meant something to me, and this is one of those albums. Another reason this seems like a good time to review, is that it's getting cool up here in New England, and nothing's better to listen to during jacket weather than \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\". Pretty much my first memory of \\"U2\\" was hearing \\"Pride (in the name of love)\\", and really being blown away by it, both lyrically and musically. The live version is amazing as well. Other popular songs are \\"Bad\\", \\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\", and the title track, all similar in style, and all wonderful. However I also really enjoy the mellow \\"Promenade\\", \\"Indian Summer Sky\\", and \\"Elvis Presley And America\\" just as much. Plus there's the moving \\"MLK\\", which is a perfect ending to a perfect album. Anyone who's a fan of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" should love this too. To me the two albums are equals. I also really dig the 90's material like \\"Zooropa\\", but this era is even more \\"Unforgettable\\".
0060755598|4.0|This book deserves 7 stars for pointing out the fallacies of how most entrepreneurs operate. The book deserves 1 star for proposing a standard that most people cannot hope to meet. Pay attention to the former, and go light on the latter.<br /><br />Gerber is correct that most entrepreneurs are limited by a comfort zone of wanting to remain in control as either strong technicians or managers, which limits the potential of the business. As soon as they exceed what they can handle, the business either fails in a break-out attempt or shrinks back to a simpler state. The new businesses that succeed the most are the ones that have a business model that is easy to replicate with ordinary people.<br /><br />Where Gerber goes wrong is in suggesting that many people can develop such business models. I regularly study the top 100 CEOs in the country for stock-price growth, and few of them think they can develop a new business model. Why should someone starting up a new company be likely to do better than that? They won't. In fact, I have a friend who attempted to start a new business following Gerber's principles and almost failed before he adjusted to normal operating approaches. He spent so much time developing his business model that he never got around to operating it.<br /><br />Gerber's three favorite examples are McDonald's, Disney, and FedEx. Notice that two of the three got most of their business model ideas from someone else (Ray Kroc from the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California and Fred Smith from an Indian air freight operation).<br /><br />I think there is another fallacy here: You can get ordinary people to do simple things (deliver packages, cook and deliver cheap hamburgers, and smile at people on automated rides). But in many businesses the demands of the market are extraordinary such as in many technological product businesses and services. Microsoft has a business model, for example, but it is not one that Gerber would recognize.<br /><br />Finally, he condemns people who want to operate their business as a job by being technically expert. What if Peter Drucker spent all of his time developing business models and systems to make pizzas and tacos rather than writing business books about management? What if great musicians developed business models for teaching children to play the violin and piano rather than performing? In other words, there is room and a need for extraordinarily able one-person companies run by technicians.<br /><br />But don't let my quibbles keep you as an entrepreneur from failing to appreciate the excellent case Gerber makes for having a business model as soon as possible, and working systematically to improve it. If you can do that, you may well develop a true irresistible growth enterprise.br />Finally, he condemns people who want to operate their business as a job by being technically expert.

B00005O3VC|5.0|I'm not even sure why I'm bothering with a review for this cult classic. EVERYONE over the age of 12 has seen this. There are only two kinds of people on this globe, sayeth I--those who \\"get\\" Monty Python, and those poor, unwashed souls who think that Adam Sandler is funny.<br /><br />On a purely quote-by-quote basis, this beats out This Is Spinal Tap, The Life Of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda, Army Of Darkness, Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein. COMBINED. The opening credits sequence alone has more jokes crammed in it than an entire hour of Saturday Night Live (and that's pre-1996 SNL, mind you). The timing is brilliant, the total lack of a budget works in the film's favor (\\"ou've got two empty 'alves of coconuts and you're banging 'em together!\\"), the performances are ace, etc. etc. etc. (\\"GET ON WITH IT!!\\").<br /><br />This is the ultimate movie geek experience. If you claim to be down with British humor and can't quote at least two-thirds of this movie (accents and all) you are LAME.<br /><br />The picture quality is good, the Lego Camelot bit is cool, and it's even got some educational value (\\"How To Use Your Coconut\\")! So buy this DVD before I wave my private parts at your aunties.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I just got through viewing Star Wars (A New Hope) on DVD, and it looks tremendous.  Say what you will about the Special Editions (the changes don't really bother me), the quality of this film on DVD (and remember its from original 1977 film stock) is outstanding and looks like it was practically shot yesterday.  It feels like you're viewing a whole new movie.  Any one who owns a DVD player should purchase these films, because these films are a piece of history.  These Star Wars 'purists' need to relax.  If you want to view the original films, I'm sure you can find some VHS cassettes out there.  Remember, like a previous reviewer said, these are George Lucas's films, and he has every right to alter them if he so desires.  You may not like it, but you have to respect it.  The changes don't bother me, and in some areas actually do enhance the films.  Now lets hope Episode 3 can bridge the gap, redeem the first two prequels, and create some sort of continuity for the entire saga.
0316168815|5.0|Having gone through some of the reviews on this website, I must say that I am astounded by the lack of insight displayed by some readers. Many described the book as \\"boring,\\" saying that the emotional transition the characters made between grief and closure was unsatisfying and not entertaining enough to suit their tastes. Others complained that the climax of the book - Suzy's time spent with Ray - was unrealistic, and that they'd have spent the time taking revenge on their murderer or alerting the police about their final resting place. Point missed! Suzy Salmon had watched Ray for years and I daresay fell in love with him, all the while wondering about and longing for what could have been. When she possessed Ruth's body, it was not about getting even, or reporting Mr. Harvey, it was about growing up and recieving closure in a different way than the reader had anticipated. It also showed that though her murder had obviously affected her, it did not consume her; she's still the girl she once was.  <br /> <br />Others have commented that the chapter during which Suzie is assaulted and murdered is too brutal and hard to read, as well as trite and cliche. Though Sebold writes an unflinchingly horrific and tramatic event for both Suzie and the reader, it is written with a kind of tenderness that I believe comes from the author's own experience. For those who are uninformed, Alice Sebold was raped when she was a teenager, and called \\"lucky\\" by the police because her attacker had murdered his last victim. I read The Lovely Bones as though it were a theraputic reflection for the author of what might have been, as well as a powerful work of fiction.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like many of you, I am enjoying these DVD's with the enhanced sound and video.  I do not particularily like the added scenes in ANH--Jabba and Greedo especially.  However, \\"Star Wars\\" is \\"Star Wars\\" and they are still great movies.  I had some problems with the disc on ANH--it kept stopping and skipping.  I don't think the problem was with my DVD player because this has never happened with new discs.  I took the set back to the store I bought it and swapped it.  Anyone else have the same problems? <br />I expected more out of the special features disc.  Guess I am spoiled by Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy box sets.  Enjoy!
0385472951|4.0|(SPOILERS)  Some readers seem very disappointed with the twist ending of \\"The Partner,\\" but I felt that, upon reflection, it was quite good and in tune with John Grisham's longtime commitment to good ethics and moral endings.  One of Grisham's strongest themes is:  lose money, find yourself.<br /><br />As \\"The Partner\\" begins, the novel's protagonist, Patrick, has absconded with $90 million illegally gotten funds from his law firm, and is hiding under a new identity in Brazil.  He has a friend/lover in Eva, a Brazilian lawyer, and Eva helps Patrick when he is captured in Brazil, tortured by private mercenaries,  and returned to America for trial by federal and local authorities.<br /><br />\\"The Partner\\" brilliantly shows how Patrick, with the help of Eva and an American lawyer friend named Sandy, fends off every single one of the enemies waiting for him and his $90 million in America:  the FBI and local authorities who want to try him for everything from fraud to murder (he burned a body in his car to fake his own death);  an unfaithful wife and her thug boyfriend; the criminal mastermind who stole the $90 million; his crooked law firm partners and their clients, etc.<br /><br />Patrick pulls it off and heads off for a wealthy life with the beautiful Eva -- and finds that Eva has run off with the rest of the money and disappeared.<br /><br />What Grisham is doing here, I think, is showing Patrick what it feels like to be left behind by a person who -- like Patrick -- runs away from his or her life.  Even as Patrick outfoxes his enemies, we learn that his flight and disappearance caused pain to his mother and friends, and led to the arrest and incarceration of Eva and the kidnapping of her own father.  Eva is simply \\"paying Patrick back\\" for the pain.  He is left broke (as Grisham always likes it -- his tales are anti-greed and anti-wealth), and hoping that he'll someday find Eva. Or that she'll again find him.  Like Patrick, Eva has escaped her old life -- and left Patrick feeling the pain of her loss.<br /><br />It's a wonderful, thought-provoking ending to one of John Grisham's best thrillers.-- and left Patrick feeling the pain of her loss. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful, thought-provoking ending to one of John Grisham's best thrillers.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I was really disapointed in the quality of this set it seem rather cheap when compaired to other set's like alien quadrilogy for example. The box it comes in is very cheap and will not last long wich is wierd considering this was the most anticipated movies to come to dvd? And also the transfer's seem over saturated with color and to dark in other parts of the film's and also the sound for the most part is amazing but in some area's the sound is very loud then get's to the point where it is to low and you have to turn the volume up I found myself turning it up and down alot. As far as them being the special editions that does not bother me although I do prefer the untouched version's these will have to do for now I just wish the box set was of higher quality.
B00003CXCT|3.0|What does everyone think about the HORRIBLE TIE fighter screw-up in the NEW HOPE during the Death Star escape sequence??!?  I have NO idea how it got past the editors.  It's HORRIBLE!  AWFUL mistake! What a slap in the face!  It's the worst thing in all three movies.  About 30 seconds of film ruined the entire boxed set for me.  I'm referring to the scene where the TIE fighters fly around the Falcon during the escape scene.  There are HUGE, discolored black boxes surrounding each fighter!  It's worse than anything in the original version of the movie!  How this got past the editors I will never know.  George Lucas should be ashamed!  He is gonna HAVE to re-do this, absolutely!  It's a MAJOR FLAW! <br /> <br />Other than this major mistake, which comprises about 30 seconds of film, I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY by the rest of the movies.  Chewbacca was much better looking and his mouth moved correctly, adding to every scene he was in.  Jabba looked better and certainly moved much better in A NEW HOPE than he did before.  Everything was improved and BETTER, except the lightsabers in A NEW HOPE.  Apparently Lucas cannot change them much.  But SO much was added that ENHANCED and IMPROVED this set overall!  It was like watching them for the first time again.  So much was added to EVERY SINGLE scene.  It was eye-candy all over the place.  Dagobah, Hoth and Cloud City especially.  Unbelieveable attention to detail.  So many things to talk about that there's just no room... <br /> <br />BUT the TIE fighter sequence during the Death Star escape in A NEW HOPE was the worst.  Unbelieveably sloppy!  The rest of the space scenes looked STELLAR throughout the rest of the movies.   <br /> <br />CHECK IT OUT, STAR WARS FANS.  You won't believe your eyes!  MAJOR BUMMER!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM FOR THE SAME REASON I'VE LOVED ALL THEIR ALBUMS.  HIS SONGS ABOUT LIFE AND GROWING UP ARE ALL THINGS THAT I CAN RELATE TOO.  ITS SCARY HOW SOME SONGS LIKE \\"BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS\\" OR \\"WHATSERNAME\\" SOUND LIKE HE'S WRITTEN ABOUT MY LIFE.  GREENDAY IS THE BEST IN MY OPINION BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY DOWN TO EARTH AND THE LYRICS ARE JUST AMAZING.  TRULY A GIFTED ARTIST. HANDS DOWN..BEST ALBUM OUT YET.  WELL ACTUALLY DOOKIE COMES CLOSE BUT THIS ALBUM REALLY RAWKS \M/
B00007BHOE|4.0|This was the best DVD I have ever seen in my life.  The performence was great, the crowd was great, everything was great. Although, the reason I am giving this DVD 4 stars and not 5 is because the amps for james and micks guitars were to quiet. But other than that it was great. My words of wisdome are...just buy the DVD, I have no other comments.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The second Harry Potter film begins as Harry and Ron fly a magic car to Hogwarts School, join their pal Hermione, and begin their second year of wizarding studies. They meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the celebrated wizard hero, Gilderoy Lockhart, but he may not be all he claims to be. Several people are attacked and petrified, and the culprit is \\"the heir of Slytherin\\" who controls a monster that lives in the \\"Chamber of Secrets.\\" As Harry tries to solve this mystery, he encounters giant spiders, a monstrous serpent, and he even faces a 16-year old Lord Voldemort in a finale that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe shines as 12-year old Harry, the orphan-hero, and he emerges as a real screen star.  He is much more confident and an all-round better actor than he was in the first movie. Rupert Grint (Ron) gets all the funny lines and proves himself a clever sidekick.  Emma Watson (Hermione) has a  smaller part this time, but is also very comfortable in front of the camera. Jason Isaacs plays the villain you love to hate, Lucius Malfoy.  I wish we saw more of him and of Kenneth Branaugh as the very funny Professor Lockhart.<br /><br />Harry Potter fans are sure to enjoy this installment, although it may be too scary for those under 7. If you like action-packed plots and really good special effects, you will not be disappointed.  The DVD includes hours of fun that includes  deleted scenes, interviews, and games.
0671027387|4.0|I really enjoyed Deception Point, even though some of the story seemed far-fetched. I especially enjoyed the beginning and the end of the book, but felt that the middle was less well written. As a thriller it is in the top five of those I've read in the last year, but I must say I rank Davinci Code, Angels and Demons, Winter in Kandahar, and Lost City higher. All things considered, however, I think you'll be glad you read it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is an interesting collection.  This collection is interesting first of all because it is like a snapshot of an era and it's interesting to see which songs by them were the most popular.  It is also interesting because it shows their absolutely astonishing development as artist and musicians over such a short period of time.  But, this album ultimately best serves as a complimentary piece and I don't recommend that it is used as an introduction to The Beatles.  This album is strong but it is not as good as \\"Rubber Soul\\" \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"The White Album\\", or \\"Abbey Road\\".  Those albums are grossly under represented. \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", and \\"The White Album\\" are not represented at all which is astonishing to me, and the few songs from \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" that are on this collection all sound better within their original context.  So, I would definitely buy all of the aforementioned albums before getting this one.  I would also strongly encourage someone to buy the 'Magical Mystery Tour' album in addition to this one because while it includes three great songs from that album, the two best and most significant, 'I am the Walrus' and 'Strawberry Fields', are not included.  With that being said, this album is still a worthy purchase for two reasons: it offers a good overview of their strongest pre-\\"Rubber Soul\\" material, and it has several great singles that can't be found on any of their full albums.  The best of the early songs are 'I want to hold your hand' which I had heard before but had no idea that it was such a great song until I heard it on this cd, and the wonderful and insightful 'Help!'  'Yesterday' could very well be the most simply sweet and wonderfully melodic song that I have ever heard, but the orchestral 'wall of sound' effect that awkwardly intrudes takes away from the overall effect in my opinion.  It's still a great song, but I've managed to find an acoustic version of this song without the intruding wall of soundthat I enjoy even more so.  Other reasons to own this cd include 'Day Tripper' which is simply just a great rock & roll song, 'Hey Jude' which is about as close to aural perfection as your going to get, and the quirky 'The ballad of John and Yoko' which I really love some for reason.  These songs can only be found on other compilation cds.  \\"Past Masters Vol.2\\" has all of the same later years non-album singles but it also includes the absolutely essential single version of 'Revolution', a wonderful soulful rocker called 'Don't Let Me Down', and a great earlier Beatles song called 'Rain', so some people may actually prefer that compilation if they had to choose only one.  With that being said,  this collection is still a worthy purchase, especially if you want a well balanced snapshot of their career.  This album is very effective in that regard.  The fact that the songs are in chronological order also makes this collection a pretty smooth and satisfying listen.  And just as a side note, I would strongly recommend to people like myself who were born years after The Beatles broke up, that you buy their albums in reverse order starting with \\"Abbey Road\\".  So to sum it up, I would recommend this cd to anyone who already owns all of the other Beatles albums from \\"Rubber Soul\\" on with the exception of the good but not great \\"Let it Be', and would like to put this wonderful group into a historical perspective.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It has certainly been a long time since we've heard a truely decent album from Green Day, hardcore fans have been disappointed with almost everything since their Nimrod album. With American Idiot, Green Day goes back to their harder style, sounding much more like  their Dookie days. Old and new fans will definitly be pleased with this latest addition from Green Day.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Don't get me wrong this is a good album but I wish billie would stop singing like he's from england because he's not.Other then that it is a good album
B00000JY1X|4.0|the best pop album in years, i just can't take the songs out of <br />my head. not perfect, but very, very good.
B000000H6D|5.0|This is my favorite type o negative album.To me there are no bad songs on it.The stand out song that I would have to say is Black # 1 I mean it just is cool.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|AVRIL LAVIGNE IS BACK!!! and is better than ever! this cd is a thousand times better than her previous work on &quot;Let Go&quot;. She is more her and had the freedom to write what she wanted. She can get the credit for her lyrics on this album becuase she abondoned The Matrix (good job, Avril) All of the songs on this new album are darker than the old Avril. with her breakups being known and her feelings buried within these songs, i give her tremendous credit! she even collaborated with Raine Maida (our lady peace) and Chantel Kreviazuk. AVRIL IS THE BEST!! AND I CANT WAIT FOR HER NEW ALBUM!!<BR>my favourites song on the album are (even tho they r all excellent..): take me away, together, my happy ending, nobodys home, forgotten, slipped away(which is about her grandfather passing away....awww). I LOVE AVRIL!!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!
B000002UWP|5.0|Listening to this CD carefully, things move along routinely (albeit very nicely) until you encounter \\"Spending My Time\\" -- a stupendous pop song among merely nice pop songs.  Absorbing \\"Spending My Time\\" on headphones, in a relaxed situation, you wonder what it's like, to write some pop lyrics and some pop music, put the two together and suddenly realize that you've created something GREAT in the world of pop music.  This one song makes the album worth acquiring -- it's a beautiful, powerful love song.  What a feeling of exhilarated satisfaction there must have been, the very first time Per and Marie heard this after recording it.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I've hoped that the new director Alfonso Curon could have made the third part of Harry Potter books better than the first, but, I was wrong... That son of a... wasn't going to the book at all!!! The movie could have been better when Columbus was the director of the third part (because he is doing everything by the book). And i hope that \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" is going to be a sucess (but with Alfonso no way!!! New director immidaetly!!!)
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has continued to mature and create better and better albums, and American Idiot has some of the best tracks on the shelf right now. It's nice to see that not all popular music sucks.  <br /> <br />For those of you who believe a band has 'sold out' because they are on a major label, or have become more popular than your control, I advise you go stick your head in a toilet, cause your not a true music fan.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has been my favorite band since I first herd Dookie. After that I have been hooked for life. I have owned all their cds from 1000 Hours to, of course, American Idiot. This cd is an instant classic. For anyone who likes Green Day or great music then this is for you. After there somewhat dissapointing release of Warning they totally got whatever they might have lost of that cd back. Every song, not just a few, but every song is put together perfectly. Go buy it, you will not be dissapointed. This is the best cd that I have herd in a very long time. <br />  <br />Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool and the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles. <br /> <br />Jesus Of Suburbia, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Whatsername, etc. One through twelve are my favorite songs. Please take my advise and buy this cd. I listen to tons of music. That is all I do. I know what is good and what is not. And this is better then good. American Idiot is AMAZING!
0060925000|3.0|No, he is not Tolstoy. Or Proust, of whom he likes to make fun. His style is amiable, unpretentious and amusing. He reminds me, most of all, of TROLLOPE, particularly the Trollope of the Parliamentary [Palliser] novels. He might not be a profound observer of the human condition, or an Olympian of the English language, but his writing has charm and point. And he sure deploys a large canvas!      His protagonists are a very irresponsible but lovable 25-year-old boy and a much TOO sensible 20-year old girl, and the other characters run the gamut from broad Trollopian rajas and intoxicatingly devious manipulators to saints out of Louisa May Alcott and feral parodies  la Sophie Portnoy. As I said, this book covers a lot of ground-as huge as India itself-yet centered on domestic, provincial concerns, as Indian life itself is.  The story never loses focus.    I read it entirely in doctors' waiting rooms, as my father got hour upon hour of chemotherapy; it took me into a different world, and held me there without fail. Maybe that's a little too rosy, but I sure needed it. I don't think Kafka would have been as helpful.    Maybe I'll re-read Barchester Towers next.
B00003CXCT|2.0|i saw star wars when i was seven years old.  it literally changed my life.  it was the first film that made me fall in love with movies and that romance has been burning bright since.  when i watched my first dvd i couldn't wait for the release of the trilogy on dvd.  truthfully, i figured mr. lucas would pull out all the stops.  i had imagined that the set would be a seven disc set that included the original and special edition versions of the three masterpieces, plus a disc overflowing with special features.  to find out that not only is it a four disc set, but also that even more additions have been made to the film is disappointing.  my wife and i recently had a child, a boy.  upon finding out that the trilogy would be released i was seriously stoked to know that i could share that vision and joy of \\"a new hope\\" with my son.  but in reality, he will be seeing a new film, and mr. lucas has stated that he will never release the original (even though there are bootlegs of the original in circulation internationally).  on the other hand though, it is star wars!  the additions do take away from the orginals, but it is still star wars.  it remains one of the greatest cinematic visions (and franchises) of cinematic history and there is nothing more thrilling than hearing the opening bars of the theme song.  so while fanatics will be disappointed it is still great to be able to see some of our best friends in this new medium.  may the force be with you, always.
0345446798|5.0|Tricia has done it in a whole new style.  This book took the information of solid training books and put it into an easy read with wonderful insights that sterile training books miss.  <br />This would be a great book for getting started before getting the dog and a must read for anyone who already has a dog. It was packed full of training help with great stories that helped explain it to the newbies who haven't seen it all.  For those who have seen it all this book brings it home again with delightful stories and a humour rarely seen in dog training books.
B000000I0I|5.0|It is impossible to give this stuff anything less than 5 stars. It is even better than Tubular Bells, the so called Mike Oldfield masterpiece. Both the long instrumental tracks are haunting and the hidden vocal track is so beautiful I continuously hum it for a day or two every time I listen to it.  <br />This must be one of the best instrumentals albums (well it is 95% instrumental). Offcourse it does not beat stuffs like Ian Anderson's \\"Divinities\\" but that was a roam into another genre. Like Tubular Bells, most instruments has been played by prodigious Mike Oldfield. Go for it for an ethereal, out of this world experience. Only weak point can be the themes may seem repeatative for people not into this kind of music.
0553579908|5.0|Wonderful depth, intelligence, skill, and even some vastly interesting/frightening metaphysical themes can be found within this series.   <br /> <br />Much like normal life most of the events in the series are made up of mundane level events ascribable to human foibles and the violence that life/competition brings.  There is however magik in this series despite some odd claims of the opposite seen in these reviews.  Even in the first book there is some.   <br /> <br />For sex and violence the book does rate a hard R or NC17 rating though not X.  It's realistic, especially in times of war and given the social stratification existant in the societies portrayed.  I wouldn't buy this for anyone under 17 and I wouldn't hesitate to let most teenagers watch R movies.  Some things are disturbing.  Once again, I view this as a work for ADULTS.  Not perverts.  Just adults.  If considering buying it as a gift for nonadults, read the first two books yourself first. <br /> <br />I found the use of different viewpoints to be executed with technical brilliance.  It does require a more advanced reader than simpler books.  As it's for adults, this is well and good.  If it's more advanced than some adults have capability for, this is well and good.  Written work should not be dumbed down to high school reading level or below and stagnate human consciousness by refusing to develop us. <br /> <br />Some attempt to call this series a soap opera because seemingly there isn't some Mordor or Darth Vader pointed out in book one that is the ultimate evil that the heroes are suppsed to defeat.  I think their expectations are self limiting.   <br /> <br />This series is not for everyone nor was it intended to be which I am grateful for.   <br /> <br />I give George R.R. Martin extreme praise for these books. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have noticed a lot of people complaining about the changes Lucas has made for the DVD editions.  I agree that most of the additions are either unneeded or hurt the films, but I feel he has the right to make \\"Director's Cut\\" or whatever you want to call them.  The thing that I (and others) am pissed off about is that he is not releasing the Trilogy in its original form.  He could have easily put both the original and altered editions in the same set, but he decided that the new versions are the only \\"true versions\\".  Because of this I have no plans on buying this set.  If he ever decides to release the original versions, which sounds doubtful, I will buy those.
055357342X|5.0|Wonderful depth, intelligence, skill, and even some vastly interesting/frightening metaphysical themes can be found within this series.   <br /> <br />Much like normal life most of the events in the series are made up of mundane level events ascribable to human foibles and the violence that life/competition brings.  There is however magik in this series despite some odd claims of the opposite seen in these reviews.  Even in the first book there is some.   <br /> <br />For sex and violence the book does rate a hard R or NC17 rating though not X.  It's realistic, especially in times of war and given the social stratification existant in the societies portrayed.  I wouldn't buy this for anyone under 17 and I wouldn't hesitate to let most teenagers watch R movies.  Some things are disturbing.  Once again, I view this as a work for ADULTS.  Not perverts.  Just adults.  If considering buying it as a gift for nonadults, read the first two books yourself first. <br /> <br />I found the use of different viewpoints to be executed with technical brilliance.  It does require a more advanced reader than simpler books.  As it's for adults, this is well and good.  If it's more advanced than some adults have capability for, this is well and good.  Written work should not be dumbed down to high school reading level or below and stagnate human consciousness by refusing to develop us. <br /> <br />Some attempt to call this series a soap opera because seemingly there isn't some Mordor or Darth Vader pointed out in book one that is the ultimate evil that the heroes are suppsed to defeat.  I think their expectations are self limiting.   <br /> <br />This series is not for everyone nor was it intended to be which I am grateful for.   <br /> <br />I give George R.R. Martin extreme praise for these books. <br /> <br />
B0002JJBZE|4.0|I am waiting to know what special features this set is going to have. <br /> <br />When will this become available? <br /> <br />Being Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner (Horses..ugh!) had their spotlight on the 1st season set, I would love to see Deforest Kelly and James Doohan get some spotlight on this set to say the least. Even include my favorite..Nichelle Nichols. As a wonderful intelligent lady as she is, she would give a wonderful spotlight special feature. How about some bloopers even? OR a \\"Making Of Trek\\" feature would be great too...include a feature on Matt Jefferies, designer of sets, props and ships...etc...the possibilities are endless... <br /> <br />And I hope some of the quabbles with the 1st season set are addressed here with this set. E.G. A PLAY ALL feature for each disc would be very welcome. <br /> <br />I'm waiting here...
B00005QXDD|4.0|Well I just got this cd a week ago and I couldn't believe it. Jack and Kyle are really great musicians. Jack's vocals sound so cool and the lyrics are great. It took me a couple of listens to the whole cd to get use to it. I didn't find this cd extremely vulgar. Yes, they cursed a lot but only on some songs. Kyle is one of the greatest guitar players ever. That got the cd 2 stars. Jacks vocals got this cd 2 stars. Didn't get the fifth star because this cd is missing some good Tenacious D songs from the HBO episodes. It is missing songs like Cosmic Shame, Sasquatch, and Kyle Took a Bullet for Me. Also there are too many skits on this cd. Of course the skits are funny but they get boring after listening to them a lot. I wish they made the songs longer. It seemed like right when the song was getting really good it ended. Also remember that this cd is not only acoustic, now the songs have drumming and electric guitar played in them. This overall is a great cd for any fan of Jack Black, or rock music. Below I have the rating for each song and the length of each song. For the skits I just have N/A.     1.Kielbasa-(3:02)-10/10   2.One Note Song-(1:24)-N/A   3.Tribute-(4:08)-10/10   4.Wonderboy-(4:07)-10/10   5.Hard *******-(0:36)-N/A  6.FHG-(2:03)-10/10  7.Explosivo-(1:55)-10/10  8.Dio-(1:41)-8/10  9.Inward Singing-(2:13)-N/A  10.Kyle Quit The Band-(1:30)-10/10  11.The Road-(2:20)-10/10  12.**** Pushups-(0:47)-N/A  13.Lee-(1:02)-10/10  14.Friendship Test-(1:31)-N/A  15.Friendship-(2:00)-10/10  16.Karate Schnitzel-(0:37)-N/A  17.Karate-(1:05)-10/10  18.Rock Your Socks-(3:33)-10/10  19.Drive Thru-(3:01)-N/A  20.Double Team-(3:11)-10/10  21.City Hall-(6:47)-9/10    GET ready for there movie coming out in 2005.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Ten years ago, Green Day put out their third and most popular album, Dookie. With it came hordes of angsty teens who cared little for the world around them. I was one of those angsty teens, and you probably were too. Even the kids with Dead Kennedys and Discharge patches had to admit, some of the stuff was catchy.  <br />Now Green Day has matured beyond the three-minute, three-chord apathy band to put out a really good album with social and political undertones that might not be Anti-Flag, Aus Rotten, or Propagandhi, but then again, they shouldn't be. Ignorant conservatives (but aren't they all?) contend that this is some America-bashing, commie scum album that we should all avoid if we don't want Tom Ridge at our door, but in fact, its a solid rock opera about a young man lost is a world gone mad, and trying to deal with it. The politics take a back seat to the social content. Already, of course, the right wingers have begun assaulting the album with their terrible spelling and fragmented sentences. One reviewer said that Billie Joe is a Libertarian...He isn't. He voted for Nader in 2000, and is obviously not happy with the Bush Admin. He also suggested that the line in Holiday (another protester has crossed the line/to find the money's on the other side) isn't bashing the left, but rather bashing liberals who sell out to a corporate agenda. So ignore all the ignorant BS from the GOP amazon members, and pick up this extremely well produced and well executed album that is just as relevent today as it will be years from now. American Idiot is the perfect album for the teen age dookie fan who grew up into a socially conscious adult. Even though Green Day might not be a punk band, you can still pick up Plastic Surgery Disasters or Reagan Youth 12\\" and see where these guys came from.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This is the worst movie I have seen. The first five minutes were good (Where Van Helsing encounters Jeckyl and Hide) but the rest is horrible. The acting is terrible. Note the scene with Dracula and his three wifes. It is sure to go down in the notebooks as one of the worst acted scene in history. This movie is trying to hard to be cool and ends up as just another Hollywood pice of garbage.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow. Not much I can say here--I dont have time to read all these other reviews but I imagine they pretty much cover most of the bases. <br /> <br />What I will say is this: I have never enjoyed a show as much as I enjoyed Firefly. I was never an Angel fan, and while Buffy had some cool episodes and Sarah Michelle Gellar, it was otherwise forgettable. Not so with Firefly! This show hit the perfect mix of science fiction, western expansionism, and character development.  <br /> <br />I was surprised how successfull the show is at making you care. I watched the first episode on fox when it aired and before the show was 5 minutes old I had already fallen in love with everything about it, and anyone who knows me knows that just *doesnt* happen :)

0201485672|5.0|This is one of the best programming books I have ever read, and provides techniques that I use in all my programming projects in any language.   <br /> <br />It is essential to underscore the message that \\"Refactoring\\" is *NOT* rewriting.  It is a deterministic, structured approach that can take unmaintainable code and gradually convert it into something that can be understood.   <br /> <br />I've heard so many people say \\"I'll refactor this code\\" when they are actually going to redesign and rewrite it.  Take their keyboard away until they understand the difference!   <br /> <br />Too many projects get maintained to death, and then leave no other option than a rewrite.  Refactoring techniques aim at the root of this collossal waste of resources, and establish a \\"clean code culture\\" that will protect the organization's investment.  I strongly suggest that every team leader use this book as a guide to set up group exercises on the worst code they support.  This will generate significant discussion on what quality really means, in a tangible, concrete way.  Forget variable naming conventions, typographical standards, formatting guidelines!  The fundamental structure of the code is the key.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, Im a hardcore punk and ska fan.  Favorite bands are Anti-Flag, The Descendents, Operation Ivy,Bad Brains and Swingin Utters.  So Im not some trendy punk-rocker.  But Green Day is the only mainstream punk band that I can consistantly listen to.  Even though most punk rockers consider them the Anti-Christ of punk rock......I like them.  First of all this album gets 5 stars not because each song is good, but it get five because of the \\"concept.\\"  I mean this tool a lot of time and effort to make a whole story and songs that tell the story.  As a song writer I can relate on how hard it is to writing a single song not to mention a whole opera!!!!  So here is my take on each of the songs. <br /> <br />American Idiot- Good opening track.....Old school style but not the best song. <br />Jesus of Suburbia-One of the best in my opinion.....All the parts are great and I can never get tired of it. <br />Holiday-My favorite as of now!!! Great tune and the breakdown is just fantastic. <br />Blvd of Broken Dreams-Not a punk song, but a great melody probably my second favorite. <br />Are we the Waiting-Good chatting song....It surprised me. <br />St. Jimmy-Great punk song Ramones style. <br />Give me Novacaine-Eh not to crazy about it. <br />She's a rebel-Back to the dookie days great short pop-punk song. <br />Extradordinary Girl-Eh once again not bad...Good chorus. <br />Letterbomb-I like the beginning but thats about it. <br />Wake me up when september ends- At first I was like yuck, but then it grows on you very sad song. <br />Homecoming-Dont liek the death of st. jimmy....but when nobody likes you comes along i think its great and rock and roll girlfriend is just like the ramones. Were coming home again also has great harmonies and overall great sound.  <br />Wahtsername-Even though I said holiday is my fav... This is my favorite.  Perfect way to end a story. Very sad and touching.  Can bring a tear to an eye.   <br /> <br />Go out and buy and enjoy.
B0002OERI0|5.0|After the lukewarm album Warning I thought Green Day was washed up and past their prime. American Idiot has proved me wrong. I was so impressed with the different music styles mixed with the Green Day sound. This album rocks, and the concept works. Only thing I would have done different is the ending - a reprise of the song American Idiot would have sent the album out on a kick a** note. The problem with going out with Whatsername is that you don't really know the opera is through. Very minor for a classic album.
0312263120|1.0|I have some experience with the NSA and cryptography. As soon as Brown's characters enter the NSA, it is apparent that Brown has no clue, has never been there, doesn't know the atmosphere or the people, that this book is pure schlock. You have to admire the guy for getting rich writing novels with stereotyped characters and grossly manipulated historical thesis. To think his stuff is being 'seriously' debated is amazing. The DaVinci Code is nonsense. This book is too. Too bad there isn't a rating for less than one star.
B00020BVXI|2.0|Spider man is mediocre film. Crappy direction, bad visual effects, cheesy emotions and Hollywood clichs enhanced by an stupid script. Any serious consideration concerning the quality of its well manufactured commercial approach is completely absurd and futile. Don't mind the childish aspects of its whole concept, you won't need to use your brain through this movie (just the way you like it dear Spider Man Fan). Is it entertaining? Well yeah, but Jerry Springer is way more entertaining and way more stupid. Is it exiting like a roller coaster ride? Hell no! The action sequences are a constant routine, besides the script was to simplistic and superficial to let any of them turn into a real cliffhanger. Is the love story really compelling? Like a soap opera I would say, and just as bad. What about the villain? Well, Willem Dafoe is a great actor, but the Green Goblin thing was to over the top for him, so he is not to blame (the Green Goblin outfit seems like a big pajama with a helmet). And what about Tobey Mcguire as Peter Parker? His looks and performance really fit the character essence, but the film was so bad that it didn't matter, and Sam Raimi has to take all take all the blame for this. It's not his understanding of the characters and their world what he got wrong, but the choice of script and easy direction that pushed every emotive theme too heavy over the protagonist, making everything shallow and vulgar. With great Power comes great Responsibility! Is this line a joke? Hell yeah! Pure vacuity by definition.   So, Peter Parker is a dump nerd trying hard to find his way in life. No body likes him, everybody mocks him, the girl he loves seems to close and away, not a penny in his pocket, and other minor dramas are drawn in his way to become a superhero. Plus, the tragic element enters his life when his beloved uncle dies, Mary Jane hooks up with his best friend, and the villain is born by another accident (who by the way, is the father of his best buddy), andsuddenly: BANG! That is the plot.  I suppose some credit has to be given to the treatment of Spidey's Origin; the rest of the movie is developed between predictable situations and corny adolescent weeps. But any kind of critical statements towards this film may end in a big: who gives a fu...! Its enormous box office success is enough to shut anyone's mouth. Now take also into consideration the DVD income, trigger happy studio executives and ecstatic  pseudo-artistic film makers won't be sad at all with bad reviews.   The visual effects (made up by the already doubtful I.L.M.), resulted in an exposure of cheap muscular movements and bad body textures, too obvious to the be ignore by today's highly trained Spectator Eye (cause anything less the seemingless is not good enough). And of course, the jokes where deadly stupid.   Good and accurate photography, an O.K. music score by Danny Elfman, nice editing and some ephemeral moments of decent narration (plus some dry kisses), made this flick a real taster's choice (that is if you are a fan of Gigli and those dump films that Jerry Bruckheimer so often loves to produce). Questions about; Why Kirsten Dunst was selected to play Mary Jane instead of a Hot Busty Blonde? Can never be answer. Mary Jane importance was all about that lousy wet T-shirt scene, the rest was about looking pretty (no acting incorporated).  There are various versions available of the Spider Man movie on DVD (including a Limited Edition Collector's Gift Set), everyone comes with great Visual and Sound Quality, plus a generous number of special features about the making of this junk. The 3-Disk Deluxe Edition can be considered a less hurtful move to your pocket (Its better to give it as a gift than to own it).   The problem with this kind of films is how easy they can look silly without ever touching their concept with seriousness, the concern is always about looking good in their outfits, the story and its treatment is secondary.    And so, Comic Book adaptations have reached rock bottom. With titles like Spider Man, The Hulk, Dare Devil, and The Punisher, from here on, it can only get better. And never in cinema History such an empty and shallow film has tried so hard to be intimate and personal. The fun side of it is only in your mind, not on the celluloid print.
0060512806|1.0|Snowcrash was a work of rare brilliance.  Cryptonomicon is a dull and plodding rehash of obscure historical events,  poorly narrated.  While there is some gold here (literally and figuratively) the work to dig it out far exceeds the meager rewards... I suggest another book...
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|What else can one do but agree with most of the previous reviews?! <br />This is a fine action movie, with some great action scenes. <br />The Bourne Supremacy, almost entirely shot and post-produced in Berlin (yes, even the tunnel-chase scenes in 'Moscow' are actually done in the Tiergarten Tunnel), the movie highlights all it's locales well and gives most it's actors some interesting things to do - with the exception of Franka Potente (where did that come from ?! What happened to her character was a silly plotpoint to get the movie rolling and give Bourne some urgency - nothing else) and Julia Stiles, whose scenes up from a point seems to have been simply cut out without explanation. The Camera - ok, let's just agree that at best, this is a bad, bad choice. AND, it looses it's novelty, if you do it throughout the whole movie. In the end, so as to not to echo all the other reviews again, a fine action flick, that to me however felt 'cut' at various places (and thus a tad bit incoherent) with camera work that surely should have co-marketed with some strong headache medicine.
0440234743|4.0|In many ways The Testament adheres to a standard formula. There is the billionaire who, while focused exclusively on his business dealings, has gone through many wives and countless mistresses, and (surprise, surprise) has produced greedy, self-centered kids with no redeeming qualities. At the end of his life, he is fed up with them and literally casts them aside in his last will and testament. Of course, that invites a huge legal furor on the part of the children with all of the predictable backstabbing among themselves and their lawyers. And the typical out-of-the-mainstream Grisham lawyer encounters all of the expected difficulties, weather, logistics, injury, disease, etc, in tracking down the heretofore-unknown main beneficiary in the Brazilian jungles.<br /><br />Despite the formulistic aspects of the book, the trials and tribulations of Nate O'Riley, the dispatched lawyer, both past and present, make for an interesting story. Perhaps the reader could wish for a greater role for the missing heiress; her story is inspiring and maybe a little puzzling. All in all, a good Grisham effort.
B00003CXCT|3.0|It's a shame that George Lucas has tampered with a true masterpiece.  I have to agree with the other reviews, especially with the person who mentioned the analogy about the Mona Lisa.  How could he ruin such perfection?  Well he did.  Once again in a Jar Jar Binks effort he has changed lines, watered down the true \\"dark\\" feel of the originals, and has tried to make Han Solo look pure \\"vanilla\\".  How could he have changed the bar scene by not having Solo show his true aggression by striking first?  My suggestion is that you try and get the originals on Laser Disc on E-Bay.  Mr. Lucas has completely written off the very individuals like myself who got this whole ship off the ground back in 1977.  Without us ther wouldn't have been a phenomenon.  Oh by the way I have heard that in the new release Darth Vader only appears for two minutes at the end of the film.  Can you believe it?  May be he'll  bring back Jar Jar and have him turn to the Dark Side.  Good grief.  Take care.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Well, I would welcome this set if it were the original theatrical releases, but every time George releases these films, he manages to change more of history in the process.  For those of you too young to know the truth-these films are not the original theatrical releases, and farther from it than you might think.  All I can say is that HAN SHOT FIRST, period.  George Lucas gets rich, we get revisionist history.  Would you want to watch Casablanca in color?   <br />  Did you know that in this DVD version of Jedi, Lucas has superimposed the face of that Hayden actor onto the face of the original Anikin Skywalker at the end of the movie when Luke is the only one to see their Force lifes?  Amazing that Lucas has done this, just amazing.  Dont buy these films, find the orginal on Laserdisk or old-VHS, then burn them to DVD on your own.  GREEDO DID NOT SHOOT FIRST!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I just spent the day watching the newly released Widescreen DVD edition against my Laserdisc (LD) CAV Definitive Collection (for those unfamiliar with it, a 9 laserdisc box set THX remastered in 1993 that remains the highest quality version of the unenhanced originals until now and if you're lucky is the source for the bootlegs.)  For technically inclined types, I'm watching on an old Pioneer CLD-704 (reasonably high end LD player but 10 years old) versus a Sony DVP-7700 (5 year old reference DVD player) on an 6 year old 32\\" analog Trinitron.  Your mileage may vary if you have a HLD-X9, line doubler, and a plasma HDTV.    My judgment is that the DVD release is simply a milestone in DVD sets, comparable to nothing I've ever seen in terms of video quality.  While watching, the thought occured to me that I was surprised to see VH1 showing heavy people in their 50s doing interviews for the set; the sheer sharpness of images and completely deartifacted frames is astounding and makes me think this came out last week.  Colors are magnificent.  Space blacks are deeper, planet and ship scenes against them cleaner, troubling things like contrast with white-walled interior scenes look more realistic, and the good part of CGI has been to enhance detail of such things as C3POs wiring and making Jabba look as good as Yoda did in II.    I love the soundtrack as well.  The subwoofer and center channel additions of Dolby 5.1 versus the LD Dolby Surround (2 front, 2 back, no distinct subwoofer) are noticable, especially in battle and space scenes.  (Listening to the wind blow across Tattoine and the tympani sequence upon Death Star ignition is a reason to own a subwoofer.)  It is a technical achievement of which the folks in Marin should be proud.     Now for the other side.    First, the extras are impressive at first glance but in comparison aren't that great.  The commentaries are similar to those on the LDs, with both sets having a couple exclusives the others don't.  Photo stills are good but basically identical to the LDs.  There are a couple of nice featurettes that aren't available on the LDs (and a couple on the LDs that aren't on DVD), but the best one - a great 2 hour making of the trilogy special - has already been broadcast on cable several times.  What is most frustrating is that deleted scenes - most notably the famous early Luke and Biggs scene in IV that appeared in picture books but not in the movie - still didn't make the DVD set.    More noticably, as you have probably read elsewhere these are in fact the 1997 versions of the movies.  That means that you do get the Jabba scene in IV - the one great add - along with several things that purist fans (usually born between 1963-1973 who saw the originals in the theaters as young kids) simply hate.  What is more amazing is that Lucas has tinkered _again_, making the Rodian bounty hunter Greedo in the cantina shoot only slightly before Han Solo rather than long before as in the 1997 film, as well as substituting Hayden Christensen for the anonymous actor who played the old Anakin in the pyre scene.  (This last one made my jaw drop as the internet gossip was right.  At least he didn't sub in Ewan MacGregor as Obiwan.)    So be it.  It is Lucas' right to do what he wants with his baby.  He's earned it given what he had to go through to make Star Wars in the first place.    However, Lucas' decision not to include the original versions as an additional disc or two has probably singlehandedly saved Laserdisc as a viable format for the foreseeable future.  Honestly, while the DVDs are a magnificent technical achievement, the quality gain over the 1993 THX remastered LD is noticable but not that dramatic...and with the right equipment, you can probably cut that down.    This is why I am keeping my Laserdisc.  And this is why I think Lucas has singlehandedly saved the format.  For those of us too lazy to transfer the original series to bootleg DVD, we will not part with the defining memoryof our childhoods.  DVD is a better format than Laserdisc (especialy since no new movies have been released on it since 2000!), but to watch one of our most precious memories as a kid the way we remember them is worth it for some of us.  We're not getting rid of the one way we can do it in quality - Laserdisc.  Pioneer and Ebay should write Lucas a check.    For others, Lucas has his presentation the way he wants it, and it is magnificent. More power to him, and if you didn't see the films the way they were presented originally as a kid you probably don't mind the changes.  For me, I have the DVDs for the commentary and features.  However, when I have friends over to watch it, my old Laserdisc will keep humming with the original versions until it breaks.  For those of us with several hundred or thousands of dollars to spare, an interesting add to our collection but not essential; others will be somewhat satisified with the fifty dollar DVDs.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|It should probably be pointed out that I am not basing this review on the new remastered version of Countdown, but rather on the original.  I just decided to write my review here though since it probably has a greater chance of being read by someone (and hopefully convincing them to pick this album up).  I have yet to hear the remastered version but as long as nothing was drastically changed then it should be good. <br /> <br />SONG BY SONG ANALAYSIS <br /> <br />Skin o' My Teeth - a song about Dave's failed suicide attempts.  Not my favorite song on the album, but it has great energy and forward momentum.  It was a good choice for the first track because it kinda starts the whole album out with a bang.   <br /> <br />   SCORE 3.9/5 <br /> <br />Symphony of Destruction - if you haven't heard this song, well, I strongly advice you get this album ASAP.  This is not just one of the absolute greatest songs Megadeth ever wrote.  It's not even only one of the best metal songs ever.  No, this, regardless of genre, is simply one of the greatest songs ever. Period.  The main riff is unforgettable and may in fact be the single greatest guitar riff ever devised by man.  It's amazingly simple, but sometimes simplicity is just more attractive that which is over-complicated.  The song displays much greater complexity in its outstanding chorus, however. <br /> <br />   SCORE 5/5 <br /> <br />Architecture of Aggression - true to its title, this song is extremely aggressive as it does not let up for even a second.  The guitars are razor sharp and the attacking drums are simply awesome.  It creates a very dark and oppressive atmosphere and contains a chorus that is too great for words. <br /> <br />   SCORE 4.7/5 <br /> <br />Foreclosure of a Dream - Now, this song was a fairly big hit, but for some reason it was never one of my favorites.  Along with High Speed Dirt, it almost feels out of place because it lacks the same dark sound of the other songs.  Despite this though, it actually is a great song.  It just took repeated listenings for me to really start enjoying it, though I suspect that quite the contrary might be true for the average listener.  As with every song on this album, it has a great chorus and I appreciate the originality and maturity of its lyrics. <br /> <br />   SCORE 4.4/5 <br /> <br />Sweating Bullets - this song ranks up there with Symphony of Destruction as one of the all time top Megadeth tunes.  In fact, I think this song manages to capture the essence of Megadeth.  It's creative and original, exhibits masterful technical prowess, has a sickeningly good chorus, possesses a very dark and heavy sound, showcases Dave's voice at its most extreme distortion, and has one the of most downright awe-inspiring instrumental segments I've ever heard.  I think it's pretty safe to say that if you don't like this song, you won't like Megadeth.  It is a very strange song as there is really nothing even remotely like it, but, of course, this is part of its appeal.  I can easily see how this song could both intrigue and put-off a virgin listener though.  Dave really contorts his voice in this song and that can definitely be a turn off for the uninitiated.  In fact, it's probably Dave's love-it-or-hate-it singing style that is, strangely enough, both one of the main reasons for loving Megadeth and one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of greater commercial success.  If you really can't stand his voice though, I do highly recommend sticking with it as it does tend to grow on you, and someday you may even grow to appreciate its unique qualities. <br /> <br />   Score 5/5 <br /> <br />This was my Life - they don't get much catchier than this one.  A unique and mesmerizing chorus, great singing, and spectacular end help propel this song into greatness.  Just an all around great song. <br /> <br />   SCORE 4.6/5   <br /> <br />There are five more excellent songs on this album (the most noteworthy probably being Cowntdown to Extinction and Ashes in Your mouth), but I will end my song-by-song analysis here.  Not every song on here is as flawless as Symphony of Destruction, but many are very close and even the worst song on this album is still utterly fantastic.  I've been hoping for 12 years that Megadeth would release an album that could match their effort here, but I do believe that might be an impossible task.  Overall, I view this as the greatest metal album of all time and give it a final score of 5/5.
B00003CXCT|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I was afraid that I may have made a mistake in purchasing the four disc set of Star Wars. A lot of reviewers wrote about muddy colors, poor picture quality, etc.. THEY COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG!<br /><br />THE PICTURE QUALITY OF THESE DVDS IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN FOR THESE MOVIES. After watching episode IV, I am stunned about the excellent quality and look of polish of every scene. The whole movie looks better than I have ever seen it. I don't remember it looking this good in the theater or on any VHS tape that I have seen it on over the years. In fact, one of my biggest complaints with the original Star Wars over the years has been the grainy picture quality and poor contrasting that always tended to spotlight the weaknesses in the special effects of the time. All of those special effects flaws seem to have been miraculously \\"fixed\\"! I can't believe it. Its like the movies are now shiny and new. They could have been made in 1995 instead of 1980!<br /><br />My memories of Star Wars always included some of the special effects flaws of the \\"seams\\" of space where the models did not contrast correctly and blend with the space behind them. Those flaws are gone and I couldn't be more impressed with the outstanding picture QUALITY of these dvds. They did a TERRIFIC job on the film cleanup!
B00003CXCT|1.0|This DVD set is being marketed on television as the \\"classic Star Wars\\" when in fact, it is a transformed version of what we, as children, fell in love with.  Lucas should have NEVER tampered with what was already perfect.  Replacing good old fashioned characters with computer graphics and altering scenes was a huge mistake.  We original Star Wars fans made Lucas what he is today.  We paid to see the movies.  We spent hundreds on the toys.  It's time for Lucas to pay his FANS back and offer the REAL classic trilogy on DVD.
B000286S8S|1.0|I am perplexed at some of the supportive reviews to this garbage of a \\"Best Of\\" compilation. Maybe that's why there are so many used copies available so soon after release? <br />C'mon people, \\"It ain't Van Halen without David Lee Roth\\" and the Lying Dutchmen sunbathing in denial that Spammy is better is an insult to anyone who ever wore a VH Bandana on their heads and chanted the name \\"Eddie\\" in his Pre-5150 prime. <br />The 3 new songs (if you can call them SONGS) TOTALLY SUCK! <br /> <br />Not a single one of the new tracks even comes close to comparing to anything that was released on the first 6 albums and no Die-Hard VH fan could convince themselves of that. <br /> <br />Edward Van Halen has become the punchline of his own joke of a legacy, and instead of buying their garbage when it can't even be packaged right we should be forgetting them and remembering what they used to be when the word \\"Mighty\\" was the only descriptive term that applied to that band. <br /> <br />If you really want the best tunes off this waste of space money grab, then support the original lineup by purchasing any and/or all of the first 6 albums put out by the band when they were fresh, full of fire, and actually worth reaching for the wallet. <br /> <br />They put live versions of Roth tunes with Spammy singing on them in this set, tell me that doesn't just spit in the original fans face.  <br />Band history? How can you even say it is covered when Dave is all but forgotten beyond his tracks, which are of a quality that a 4th rate singer like Spam Hagar could not, and never will be able to produce. <br /> <br />What you have here folks is a desperate attempt at shunning David Lee Roth by the brothers again while reaching for that all mighty dollar. <br />Don't be a \\"sheep\\", leave this release on the shelves where it never should have been in the first place. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this. Take the family out for dinner and at least do something worth while with your cash...Van Hagar doesn't deserve it with this release and the time has come to stop supporting a less than stellar shadow of what a real legendary band used to be with Diamond David Lee Roth. <br /> <br />Roth On!
B00006BTCA|5.0|i think it is less important to compare interpol with bands gone<br /><br />by, however strong the inclination. what is important is...does<br /><br />the music move you. as for me, i give a resounding yes. it took<br /><br />me a number of listens to become enamored with this disc. but,<br /><br />once under my skin, like scabies, it's never left. certain songs<br /><br />stand out, yet, the album as a whole is magnificent. this of<br /><br />course leads me to great expecations of their followup. i hope<br /><br />my gut feeling is accurate.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Ahh yes, when you've got Fidel Castro, Hamas and the Iranian government on your side surely you must be a true patriot. Why keep pretending to be patriotic? This film is being used around the world as anti-american propaganda. Wake up people, that's exactly what it is. Michael Moore is making an impact on world events all right. The result of which will add up to more dead Americans and more terrorism abroad. Why buy the dvd? Just send your money to the Taliban, Al Queda or Saddam Husseins legal team instead.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Hell, scratch that.  Not album of the year, but GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!  To think that this album came from a band who hit it big with a song about [wanking] ten years ago...  When I heard their \\"Warning\\" album four years ago, one song stood out to me (Misery) because of how experimental it was and I hoped that they would even be more experimental on their next album.  Well they were--they put out a really sweet concept album.  Funny how on their Kerplunk album they included a song by the Who, and now like the Who have recorded a rock opera.      This album is incredible from start to finish.  And even though every song is completely amazing, it's hard to start the album from any point other than the beginning because you have to take in the beauty of the whole album played all at once.    Buy this album, you will NOT be disappointed.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is so amazing it's hard to believe. Every song is so great. My least favorite be the first track but I still like it. This is a must have for any Green Day fan. I won't stop listening to this cd for months.
B000001FI7|5.0|I've heard so many of these songs prior to even looking at the song list on this CD.  Yet, songs I've loved from 6 years ago, I'm still blown away by today....my current favorite is 'Roads'....
B000068OSK|5.0|I know the above is a bit of an extreme statement, but that's just the way I feel haha.  I have all four of the White Stripes' CDs, and there's not a song I don't like on any of them.  With each one, upon its purchase, I listen to it over and over until the words are engrained in my brain, and I will never forget them.  This CD's permanent spot since I bought it has been in my stereo right by my bed, and I listen to it every night as I fall asleep and sometimes in the morning when I get ready for work.  I don't really know the names to many of the songs, but I could sing them all.  I noticed no one mentioned, at least in the most recent reviews, the song \\"I Fought Piranhas.\\"  This is my favorite song on that CD.  I love Jack's voice, so full of dramatic suffering, and especially the part at the end when the slide guitar (I'm assuming, I'm not a musical genius) goes up chromatically.  That part is priceless!  The only comment I have to make that isn't entirely positive is that \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\" sounds a bit like a sped up version of \\"Apple Blossom\\" on the De Stijl CD.  At least the background does.  Hasn't anyone else noticed that?  I thought it was a little strange.  Anyways the Stripes can do no wrong, and I am looking eagerly forward to any more they have to offer.  Oh and if you're a newcomer to the White Stripes, I would recommend Elephant first, as it is the most popular of their CDs, and so the most accessible.  I latched on to all of their CDs immediately, but their debut is probably the hardest for most to swallow.
B00003CXCT|2.0|That's 5 stars for the original version, minus one star for editing to get the DVD version, minus two stars for taking away control of my own FF button before the actual movie starts playing. <br /> <br />Ever since two of the three tapes in my VHS version of the original trilogy degerated to the point of being unwatchable, I have been waiting with great anticipation for the DVD versions of these classics.  SPOILERS HEREIN. <br /> <br />I about fell out of my chair when I saw Anakin as a spirit at the end of ROTJ.  I can understand adding snippets of extra scenes, e.g. the celebrations across the universe at the empire's demise, but this Anakin thing seemed pointless (notice that Obiwan and Yoda are shown in their older forms).  I could give many other similar examples, very few of which I found an improvement over the original cut. <br /> <br />Also some mention has been made in previous posts about the quality of the sound mixing.  I must say I found the audio leveling very poor - it was often difficult to hear the dialog through the background clatter and soundtrack, when the orignals were perfectly clear (e.g. CP3O and R2D2 approaching Jaba's palace at the beginning of ROTJ). <br /> <br />But the thing that really irritates me more than anything else is starting the damn movie.  Why oh why do so many DVDs force you to watch 20 seconds of FBI warnings, 20 seconds for InterPol, another 20 seconds for the MPAA thing, still another 20 seconds of worthless mish-mash, followed by some agonizingly long \\"cutsie\\" pre-menu animation (which I have to watch EVERY time I want to display the menu) before giving you control over your own fast-forward button?!  I suggest more DVD producers take a lesson from two of the greatest trilogies in DVD history as examples of how best to design control/menu functionality: The Godfather, and Lord of the Rings.  Pop it in, go straight to the menu, and then straight to the movie.  Brilliant!!
B000068FY0|5.0|I am only 31 years old (only 2 when this album came out!!!) After hearing this album, I must say this is a masterpiece!!!! for 1974, WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME!!! Beyond Words!!!!!! I am surprised this doesn't stand in the same ranks as Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; or &quot;Dark side of the Moon&quot;.....So incredible!!!!! Beautiful, emotional, transcendent!!!!! A SHEER MASTERPIECE!!!
6305744793|4.0|This movie from 1991 isn't as good as the show I don't think but it's still a really good movie. The show is better because they are nutty people but wouldn't hurt a hair on anyones head, well not on purpose anyway lol. Here they are a little too sadistic. I mean the original cast wouldn't pour a pot of hot fluids over the heads of  christmas carolers. Still though I love the cast and think the late Raul Julia made an excellent Gomaz Addams. He was lively and fun in the role. He was talented and is too bad his last movie was StreetFighter. Anjelica Huston (Witches), Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hollow) and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) are really good as well. Although I liked his movie, I really wish the show would be released on dvd.
0060575816|5.0|I love the creativity that Garth Nix uses in the abhorsen series. Truely a great read, excellent thought and style in this book. His views on the river of death are very unique and interesting. A five out of five.
0316096199|4.0|I picked up this book because I read Sebold's Lovely Bones which I liked very much. I am very glad I picked this one also. It's a fast and interesting read. It's hard to put down because this story is so common among young women. <br />The main character struggles with her life after she was raped on campus at her university. The author captures vividly the torment that rape victims go through with family, school, friends and sex life. Alice was brave and spoke up about her rape and was convinced to do everything she could to get the assailant.  <br />I recommend the book to everyone, especially those that know someone who has been raped. It is easier to help someone if you know a little more about what they're going through.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has always been my favorite band. None of their CD's had been my favorite CD, yet. American Idiot tells such a great story, has such good lyrics, and has such good music, I cannot stop listening to it. The whole CD(minus the first song) goes slightly new direction for Green Day, seperating them from their contemporaries that so often try to copy them. Weather you like rock or punk of alternative, this is definetly a CD worth buying.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is so full of BS i only watched a little over a half hour.  This Trador moore tells lies and half truths and takes advantage of morning parents.  Another thing that pissed me off, they didn't give me a refund at the movie theatre.   A movie as horrible as this one, you should get a refund.  I can't believe that there are morons in this country that no only think this piece of crap was good, but also believe all the BS in this movie..   I guess if he made a movie about how there really is an easter bunny those morons would believe it.
B00005JMX6|3.0|That is probably the signature line from this movie and in answering that question this movie really shines. Sure this movie is not original but I found myself captured by the chemistry on screen between Emile Hirsch(playing Matthew Kidman) and Elisha Cuthbert(playing girl next door Danielle). They are the most important characters in the movie and hold their own very well. I'm not going to go into just how similar this movie really is to Risky Business.(It is so similar even some of the soundtrack sounds nearly identical) I'm just going to lay out there the things that stand out most in my mind after viewing the movie twice. <br /> <br />This is coming from a single guy in his mid twenties, but I stress to say that Elisha Cuthbert simply friggin lights up the screen. Not only is she such a wonderful gorgeous, cute, knockout of a girl, she seems to just have a certain something that just makes you want to watch her just to see what she might do next. You watch her along with Matthew Kidman simply captured by her smile and her laughter. Everything seemed so light and natural. Sure her lines are nothing special but I find it rare to find somebody with such a glow. Lets put it this way. Elisha portrays a girl so smokin hot that you can't think of meaningless sex although she has every asset. This is a girl you want to make love to. The way the movie ends kind of never fully captures that especially since Danielle was trying to escape the opposite of that in porn. In fact it is so similar to Risky Business I almost choked the way it comes together. <br /> <br />Anyhow, I think most any person can enjoy the movie although the unrated version will probably offend some people with the more graphic scenes of porn watching. The supporting cast are all solid and Matthew's friends are a real laugh. The kid with the Vivid Video hat is hilarious and basically there is a scene where each supporting character forces you to chuckle. Kelly, the porn producer is so funny and creepy at times you just don't know whether to hate or love him. <br /> <br />Now, if nothing else catches your fancy, at least watch this movie for the sake of seeing Elisha. She is worth the price of admission. Hell, right now she has a welcome home on my desktop. &#60;&#62;__&#60;&#62;
B00003CXCT|2.0|I honestly don't know what to rate this collection.  On one hand I want to give it a five star rating.  I, like many others, grew up with Star Wars and have been waiting for the original trilogy to appear on DVD.  On the other hand, I am quite saddened by many of the changes.  To sum it up, I am rather conflicted...So I will just list the good and bad and let you be the judge. <br /> <br />THE GOOD: <br /> <br />Well, the picture quality is superb.  I was completely blown away by how well they remastered these films.  They look like they were made yesterday.  Also, the sound is absolutely stunning.  If you have a nice surround sound system and a big television and watch any of the 3 with the lights off, you could quite easily be fooled into thinking that you were in a state-of-the-art theatre (I tried it out on a smaller television with a mono speaker and it still sounds good so don't worry if you don't have a fancy set-up).  Also there is a decent commentary track with Lucas and others (including Carrie Fischer) talking about the movies.  It is kind of fun to listen to and informative. <br /> <br />THE BAD: <br /> <br />Frankly, after the picture and sound quality, I was extremely dissapointed.  This was supposed the be the DEFINITIVE DVD set, but unfortunately it isn't.  The special features aren't really that great.  There have been so many news shows, made-for-tv-specials, and special effects programs on television, you would think that they would have included more of it on the fourth disc.  Instead, it is just some mediocre documentary footage.   <br /> <br />The worst thing about this collection though is that the \\"original\\" original trilogy was not included.  I remember on the Abyss and T2 DVDs, there were 2 or 3 versions of each film...on each DVD.  I kind of feel jipped.  They could have put the original, the first Special Edition, and now the Definitive versions all on the same DVD for each film, but didn't.  I also feel that it is false advertising to promote these discs as just Star Wars when it is yet another special edition.  This kind of leads me to believe that the Lucas camp will eventually release the \\"original\\" original trilogy to milk the consumer of even more money instead of just including all version into this set like most other sets do.   <br /> <br />Now I know that most people are complaining about the original, unmodified versions not being availabe.  Then everyone else is complaining about the PEOPLE complaining about how the original, unmodified versions are not available.  All that I have to say is that we have lost too many original films through the years.  Look at Metropolis.  It has been chopped and edited to peices, and we are still trying to peice it back together into its original form.  The same goes for many films for yesteryear.  I have a feeling that the same thing will happen with Star Wars eventually.  The VHS copies are wearing out.  The original celluloid is wearing out.  If these versions are all that we have in the future then film historians will be trying to obtain the Laserdisc versions for prosterity. It would be much better if they unmodified originals were in full circulation also.  <br /> <br />I  honestly don't have a problem with Lucas screwing with his own films (I don't like the changes, but he does have the right).  I do have a problem with not releasing the original versions though.  I would have loved to compare the old with the new.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, everyone reading this probably already knows what Star Wars is all about.  Everyone already knows that changes have been made.  So you now have to ask yourself...Do you feel like spending 40+ dollars for a highly modified version of Star Wars that looks and sounds good but is lacking in special features? <br /> <br />If you are into Star Wars for the big booms and flashy visuals, get this.  If you want the unmodified original trilogy, go sign one of the online petitions that are in circulation.   <br /> <br/>I give this one 2.5 stars.  Even though the unmodified originals aren't included (and they should have been for prosterity's sake) and the special features are lacking (they could relase a DVD set of JUST special features) it is still Star Wars with an ultra-clear pictures and excellent sound and it kicks *** even with all of the CGI added....it just doesn't kick it as hard.
B00003CXCT|5.0|While I'm not terribly happy with the changing of some events in the movies (most of them are minor and don't affect the overall story), I would have to say this is one of the best DVD sets so far.  This is the set that I bought a DVD player for in the first place.  Now that I get to hear it in 5.1 and see the picture in amazing clarity, I am a happy camper. <br /> <br />As for the changes, now Greedo and Han shoot at the same time, which isn't too bad.  There is different dialogue with the Emperor in Empire, but that seems to be more consistent with the current Star Wars movies.  Not sure why Lucas added Haydyn Christensen unless it was for consistency sake again.  Although, if there is some other reason, it's pretty silly because Obiwan is old and he didn't change him. <br /> <br />Overall though, this was an awesome job.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Out of the recent film adaptations of the Jane Austen's novellas, this one tops them all. It's not to be compared to BBC's Pride and Prejudice as that's not a film. But when compared to Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, Gwenyth Paltrow's Emma and Francis O'Conner in Mansfield Park, this film adaptation of 'Persuasion' is my favourite.  <br />I found it difficult to accept the actress as Anne at first,  butshe does grow on you. I found this film exquisite and true to the spirit of the novel.  This version delivers in quality above all the rest. <br /> <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|The Danish Lars von Trier is a cinematic visionary and his creation Dogville is an example of his remarkable cinematic genius. The film is shot in a studio where white lines on the floor depict the where the houses and other significant landmarks are located. There is some minute use of mise-en-scene such as a top of a bell tower floating in mid air by wires and small porcelain figurines, but most of the mise-en-scene is completely removed. The transparent environment produces an atmosphere without secrets and the true nature of people is completely revealed when an opportunity appears.<br /><br />The story takes place in the small mountain village, Dogville, which is located in Colorado during the Great Depression. The young aspiring writer and philosopher Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) wanders through Dogville one late evening when he hears a shot, and later discovers Grace (Nicole Kidman). Grace has escaped pursuing gangsters and Tom decides to act as Grace's savior as he becomes infatuated with her. Tom presents Grace to the village's 15 adult inhabitants as he intends to let the village decide whether she can join the village or not. The people of Dogville give Grace two weeks to prove that she is an honorable person and not a threat.<br /><br />Grace offers herself to the town by helping with the towns chores. Initially Grace faces resistance to her presence, however, the people of Dogville decide that she is useful and they let her stay. This is the beginning of a wonderful time for Grace, but when the police turn up in the small village claiming that she is a dangerous bank robber and she has committed several robberies while she has been in Dogville townsfolk begin to demand more from her. The demands are a lead up to a beginning of a brutal exploitation of Grace's persona while Tom feebly attempts to find a reason to the madness and an escape for Grace.<br /><br />Dogville is a disturbing film with a straight forward story. However, the politics behind the film have an allegorical value as it seems to draw from both historical and contemporary issues. The film strongly hints toward the use of allegory since the intended use of almost no mise-en-scene was cleverly manufactured by von Trier. The story is well directed as the film progresses with ease as it is both chaptered and well-written. When the cinematography, mise-en-scene, cast performance, and script is put together it offers a brilliant cinematic experience that the audience can ponder and discuss for a lengthy time since it can be related to issues that have affected the world.he film have an allegorical value as it seems to draw from both historical and contemporary issues.

B000000OAA|5.0|...and Freddie is the best singer ever.What can I say?A classic metal album.Top 3 Queen albums,nuff said.
B0002VYQ2U|5.0|Norah Jones: International mega star with 25 million albums sold worldwide and sold-out tours around the globe, and she's done it all without once taking her top off for the guys! Now that's impressive ;) Norah, once again, seemlessly blends blues, jazz, folk pop and bluegrass into her gorgeous tunes. The original edition of FEELS LIKE HOME is fab, and the 3 bonus tracks ('Moon Song' and 'Sleepless Nights' are both available as b-sides on international singles) are sweet, delicate ear candy. The videos on the DVD are lovely and well constructed (nothing over the top), but the music is really why I'm a Norah Jones fans. Truth be told, Norah was actually opposed to her album being re-packaged (she finds 'deluxe' editions too commercial and insists her record label is soley responsible for FEELS LIKE HOME being re-released). That's one of the reasons I absolutely love Norah: She's about the music, not the numbers. If you don't have FEELS LIKE HOME yet, then buy this version. If you already own the regular edition, then a legal downloading service might be able to help you add the bonus tracks to your collection.    <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|Cheap paper box. <br />Cheap title menus. <br />Limited extras.  <br />My old VHS tape is clearer than the DVD on Episode IV. <br />Sound is \\"muddy\\" on the DVD. <br />These should have been released seperately at Wal-Mart for $4.78 each. Another cheap 20+ year old movie(s) released on DVD. <br />Why did Lucas wait? All about the money? You will not get what you pay for!!
B0002IU988|4.0|Having just brought Alter Bridge and listening to this CD twice before attempting to type up a review, I feel that I must. Firstly I loved Creed and all their songs. For a 90's rock band, they made such a hard hitting entrance into the sometimes savage rock business but it was profound. Alter Bridge IS the successor of Creed. I am disapointed that Creed is no more but a has been and a memory that will not die for their music will be remembered and listened to by generations to come.<br /><br />I wish Alter Bridge the best of luck in their careers as a newly formed band. On this release album, they have 3 great songs that are well on their way to becoming hits in there own right. These songs are One Day Remains, Open Your Eyes and Down to my Last.<br /><br />Alter Bridge should not be thought of Creed II but should be thought of as an able successor to Creed. I will look out in the future for the next album from this band
B0002MPU1K|5.0|After purchasing and listening non-stop to Cincotti's first (self-titled) CD I didn't see how his new CD could be nearly as good.  Well, I was wrong because it is fabulous! And now I play this one non-stop!  I can't seem to name a favorite track because I love every single song from the jazzy St. Louis Blues, Bali Ha'i and Cherokee to the lovely ballads such as On the Moon and He's Watching.  This artist has terrific piano chops and an innovative and unique keyboard style that is all his own. His voice has such emotion and feeling for someone so young and he croons those ballads ever so sweetly.  This is the first time I have ever bothered to write a review of any CD and there are a lot of them out there than I like.  But this CD is just SO enjoyable that I wanted to share my opinions.  If Cincotti's next CD is every bit as good as his first two, he's going to be around for a long time.  Like I said in my title.....go buy this CD NOW!
B00006AUIG|4.0|While I admit, the plot of this film is not all that great... But I hate to tell the naysayers out there... Style does indeed equal substance... and that isn't all this movie has to offer, I love that this one keeps you hanging on until the end, and for that guy who said 'anyone \\"whom\\" understood this movie must have been high or completely insane... maybe so, but really it's not a complex story... I liked the acting alot, a breakthrough performance for the usually vanilla David Caruso, and the rest of the cast does very well with their roles... The creepy atmosphere of Danvers really adds to the movie and really how can you have any complaints with a movie that centers around asbestos removers... I liked this one alot... It's a refreshing break from all of those movies that try to be spooky but fall flat, and I did like the characters' interactions with eachother and I wouldn't consider them subplots, it's basically formed to keep you wondering what's really going on here until that wonderful 7 minute climax at the end, a brilliant build up lets me without question forgive the basic level of the plot.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The George Lucas I knew and loved growing up, who brought us the classic saga now available on DVD only in it's bastardized versions, is dead.  All that remains is a some shameless schmoe trying to cash in as much as he can.  That he would go for the baby-sat kiddie dollars instead of appealing to his original (and overly zealous) fan base, myself included, in releasing such utter mediocrity in the form of Episode 1 (I still haven't seen Episode 2) when we all know he's capable of so much more, truly disappoints me.  Both his college material and early career work is superb, and this is what he's reduced himself to.  Boo, Mr. Lucas.  Boo.
B000003Z12|5.0|This is without doubt the best guitar album I've ever had the good fortune of discovering. Neal's guitar work is simply stunning and exquisitely moody. <br /> <br />I bought this album in 1995 and to this day whenever I listen to it I have vivid memories of an overnight drive with a very good friend en route to a coastal holiday. The road was quiet and very dark. We didn't say a word for the entire trip, we were both totally absorbed in Neal's magic, without a care in the world. I cannot remember ever having felt so entirely free in every sense in all my life. Listening today, it's still like it was only yesterday. <br /> <br />If ever you're in need of a mood change, want to wind down or want to recapture some of your dreams, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, close your eyes and listen. <br /> <br />As another reviewer says, the world would be a better place if everyone had a copy of this album.  It is life-changing, indeed.
0156907399|1.0|I cannot get over how bad this novel is. Read Faulkner as the master of the stream of consciousness technique. To the elitist reviewers who &quot;Can't believe this only has a 4 star average&quot;, wake up to the fact that this book repulses many people, and it's NOT because we can't understand the content; it's that we see through Woolf's shallow and dull story telling masked by over-the-top modernist phrasing. Seriously, this is by far the most overrated &quot;classic&quot; in our literary cannon.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Alright, I've listened to Green Day for quite some time.  Their first two full albums, 1039 and Kerplunk, tended to spend more time in the CD player more than Dookie because after Dookie, most of the albums sounded the same, but those first two albums had a different sound and lyrics that was sort of the precursor for the sound that Green Day became popular for. I was a little disappointed by Warnin g 4 years ago, as a naive kid expecting to hear Dookie.  But 4 years later, I've never appreciated Green Day more than ever.   <br /> <br />In American Idiot, Green Day doesn't take a step above all of the other albums, they take a step into a whole different world of lyrics and music that only an idiot would complain about.  If you expected the old Green Day like I did 4 years ago, you're an idiot.  This album is the true evolution of Green Day--the political stuff is a bit weird, but keep in mind that bands like 'Anti-Flag' got popular with their mindless and endless political rants. Green Day isn't as serious about politics, but keep in mind that they could've done what bands like Anti-Flag and Bad Religion have done--write the same music over and over again for 10 years.     <br /> <br />Yeah, Green Day did become mainstream...they've been mainstream since 1994.  People complain that they expected the \\"hardcore punk\\" of the past, well wake up, that ended more than 10 years ago .  Mike Dirnt said it himself, \\"When people say we aren't punk rock anymore, they're right.\\" Pick it up and enjoy a renaissance in green day.
B00003CXCT|2.0|True, it is just a movie, but a movie that we all loved and it defined a generation.  How many of us dont get goosebumps when we revisit something from our childhoods, a toy,a  movie, a song?  But George keeps us from seeing the movie that we all loved as kids.  What if Ray Harryhausen had decied to redo all of his classics just becasue the technology was better....no more King Kong, no more mighty Joe Young, no more Sinbad....what a shame that would be. <br /> <br />George we all understand that it is your movie and you certainly have the right to alter it and change it however you like....but, by not giving us the original versions too....you are stealing some of the most cherished childhood memories of Star Wars truest fans.

B0002IQHY8|1.0|Ugh!  I have been an AP fan since 1976's \\"I Robot\\" and I have suffered through highs (\\"Eye in the Sky\\") and lows (\\"Ammonia Avenue\\"), but nothing can prepare you for this shock... and I was so looking forward to a new Alan Parsons CD...<br /><br />What a mess.  If AP was trying to make Dance club music, he's failed.  Others do it better.<br /><br />Painful to listen to... arrangements are all over the place.  Nothing memorable or melodic here.  After listening to \\"Vital Path\\", just to remember how good things used to be, I had to listen to \\"There Must Be More\\" from \\"Try Anything Once\\" to re-affirm my faith in Alan Parsons abilities.  Very disappointed.
B00001NFCY|5.0|The album kicks off with Are You Ready (5/5) which is the perfect in-your-face intro to this album. Then comes What If (4/5), a great heavy track which might be overshadowed by its perfect predecessor. Beautiful (5/5) is the song with the catchy chorus which seems to be coming out of Metallica's BLACK ALBUM. Say I (4/5) and Wrong Way (4/5) are another good track which grow on you whilst Faceless Man (5/5) is the album's epic. Unfortunately, after such a great track, comes the weakest song on the CD, Never Die (3/5), which isn't bad is very unimaginative unlike other Creed songs on this CD. With Arms Wide Open (5/5) lives up to it's rock ballad status with a personal message; unfortunately this song has been played on radio stations till our ears bled. Higher (5/5) is the climax of this album, Creed at their bloody best. Wash Away Those Years (5/5) is another masterpiece with the CD's most poetic verse .... 'don't hold your tears .... they were sent to wash away those years'. Inside Us All (5/5) is a beautiful closing track with a moral message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|George Luca$ used to be a man that I admired a great deal. But his latest tampering with his original trilogy is just ludicrious. I don't know of any other film makers that have gone to the extent's that Luca$ has to redo the trilogy and make it in his opinion, better. I have not watched all of the films yet on this dvd set, but I have watched the end of Return of the Jedi, and yes the rumors are true. Hayden Christainsen does indeed show up as a ghost of Anakin rather then original actor Sabastain Shaw. Luca$ explains that he did this because of the fact that rather then have Anakin return as the old man, he would be all machine then, when Anakin was young as a young man, before the whole Darth Vader ordeal, he wasn't almost all machine. To you and me, this is just plain bs.  <br /> <br />I have no problems with changing and adding effects in, but completly cutting a charecter out and sticking a new one in is just bs. <br /> <br />But don't let this stop you from buying this otherwise excellent set, it's defintily worth it. Just bite your lip whenever you watch the end of Return of the Jedi.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I liked the album, it's different from \\"Let go\\". Great Lyrics, great sound.  <br /> <br />Take me away: Good, it's depressing but it's true! \\"Is there inside all I do is hide...\\" I think she talks about herself, it's deeper and meaningful. Great rock elements on the chorus. 10/10  <br /> <br />Together: It's a great song. I feel so identified with it. The best part is: \\"My thoughts are choking on you my dear\\". I liked the guitar. 10/10  <br /> <br />Don't tell me: It's a popish song, but I liked. Good Message: Don't give it to the boys who only wants your sex. hehe.  <br /> <br />He wasn't: I liked! It reminds me a little of \\"Sk8er Boi\\", the music. It's not great lyrically, but aceptable. It's quite funny, is about when the guy that you like doesn't give you a call. Bit weird! But I liked! 8/10  <br /> <br />How Does it feel: I liked the lyrics, but I don't like much the song, just because I'm not lover of ballads. But it's good. 7/10  <br /> <br />My Happy Ending: I understand perfectly why Avril could write a song like this. I really like it, it's a good song, quite sad but good. 9/10  <br /> <br />Nobody's Home: Quite soft, but one of my favorites. Great chorus, great lyrics!!!   <br /> <br />Forgotten: My favorite song of the album. Strong, sad, dark and angry. That's what I like!!! 11/10. The piano is great, the voice of Avril with her \\"ah, ah\\" is amazing, cool!  <br /> <br />Who Knows: I don't like it much. But I like the lyrics. 7/10  <br /> <br />Fall To pieces: Interesting, it shows an Avril who is in love with a guy. \\"I just wanna cry in front of you\\", I feel identified. whoa! I really liked!! Great Ballad. 10/10  <br /> <br />Freak Out: It's a great song. Optimistic! I like the guitars and the bass! 9/10  <br /> <br />Slipped Away: Good song, but quite sad and slow. I liked but is not my favorite. 8/10  <br /> <br />Well, this album is much better than \\"Let go\\" because it's different in so many ways. I recommend this album.  <br /> <br />By the way...Allthe Avril haters can kiss my a**!!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B0002TSZK6|1.0|By farm, one of the most slanted and jaded liberal jabs I've ever seen.  I felt a sick pulling in the pit of my stomach.  What worries me most about this film is that people that do not or have not made a point to educate themselves on this topic will tend to believe the rubbish shown here.  Education based on bias and lies is a fatal blow to true democracy.
B000002N2P|5.0|still one of my fave albums of all time. i got this cd the day it came out in 1995 and i still love it to death. it remindes me of so many good times this album is truly one of the albums i can call soundtrack of my life.
6303442889|5.0|One of the most memorable and haunting movies I've ever seen. It made me feel this film in on the mark - it's the dog wagging the proverbial tail - not the other way around as some would have us think...An even more memorable and haunting film is Threads (BBC) <br />released in the early 80's.  It's been 20+ years since I've seen that one but - if you see like (and I know you will) The Day After well, you'll have to see Threads.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's much anticipated release American Idiot does not disappoint.  This is one of the most original and exciting records of 2004.  An ambitious, multilayered concept album of righteous political anger.  The band has stated that they wanted to attempt a \\"punk rock opera\\" and to that end, they have succeeded.  Green Day have created a portrait of life in post 9/11 America and have captured the anxiety and dischord of these times in the character sketches they have provided.  They have also released one of the more politically charged albums yet this year.  A fierce, unapologetic attack on the dark political landscape in America. Before you think this album is a real downer, it should be said that its incredibly fun to listen to.  A real rocker that is brilliantly devised.  A must listen for any music buff.
B00028HBKC|5.0|The complaints I've heard are that the movie didn't have any background ... here goes: <br /> <br />In the beginning God created the heaven and earth. <br /> <br />God created mankind with free will ... He preferred that people chose to serve/worship Him instead of having a creation of \\"yes men.\\" <br /> <br />Satan (a fallen angel - who thought himself to be equal with God) tempted Eve and she and Adam disobeyed God (sinned). <br /> <br />They were thrown out of the garden of Eden and everyone born since has come into the world a sinner. <br /> <br />God's law says blood must be shed to pay the price of sin.  Before Christ (B.C.) that was done with the sacrifice of an animal (typically a lamb).   <br /> <br />Jesus (God's Son) came to be the sacrifice for all mankind and pay for everyone's sin. <br /> <br />He chose to die Himself instead of seeing all mankind pay their own price for sin (death ... and eternity in hell). <br /> <br />All we have to do is believe the above and we'll go to heaven for eternity with the Saviour.  Getting to heaven can't be earned by anything we do - other than believe that it's not up to our efforts ... the bill's already been paid - just accept / believe it. <br /> <br />Everyone else, having used their God given free will, will go to hell for eternity. <br /> <br />For more background, pick up a Bible and read it ... it's been around for 2,000 years.   Also, find yourself a church that holds the Bible as truth and start attending.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Over time, there have been many bands that have been shoehorned into a certain mold, only to break out of that mold with a great album that reaches for new boundries. <br /> <br />With \\"American Idiot\\", Green Day joins the likes of The Who (\\"Tommy\\"), Fleetwood Mac (\\"Tusk\\"), and Styx (\\"Kilroy Was Here\\") in going beyond what people thought was possible for them. <br /> <br />For the hardcore punk fans, you should enjoy the title track, which is already in heavy radio rotation, and \\"Holiday\\", which sounds somewhat like The Clash's \\"London Calling\\". <br /> <br />And we all remember \\"Good Riddance\\" from \\"Nimrod\\". This time around, we have \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", which is likely to be another punk power ballad hit for the trio. <br /> <br />If you can deal with the 2 five-part suites and the fact that most of the songs blend together, it would be well worth your while to grab this. It's a turning point for the boys that brought us \\"Dookie\\", and it's a turn in a good direction.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The quality of this DVD set is, so far, outstanding. I have a 48 JVC projection 1080i set and I am very pleased at the lack of compression artifacts. The colors are very nice and bright. I think a very good job was done to make this set top notch. I will, however, never get used to Han stepping over Jabba's tail in episode IV; that scene is just horrible. I can't believe Geoge let that one through.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't know if I can say that Star Wars changed my life. I mean, I was what--3? 4? the first time I saw it. It's more like it shaped my life. I might have been a perfectly normal little girl who liked Barbies and My Little Pony, had my early exposure not rendered me instead the type to collect Rancor Keeper action figures (with removable leather hood!) <br /> <br />I don't know for sure how many times I've seen the films. I lost track somewhere around 27. I suppose, realistically, it must be at least 60 or 70 times altogether. Certainly, whenever I see the 20th Century Fox logo, I am surprised if it is not followed by John Williams' score. (Sadly, this is not an exaggeration. Every time I hear that fanfare, my brain is primed to see a galaxy far, far away, and I feel a little sense of letdown when it doesn't occur.) <br /> <br />What that means to me now is that I can't enjoy my new DVD set as much as I'd like. Certainly, the cleaned-up audio and video are superior to my aging, greenish VHS copies. But I can't find it in myself to enjoy all the digital crap Lucas added into it in 1997. Maybe if I didn't know the films so well, I wouldn't find the additions so glaring, but for the most part I find the CGI doesn't mesh at all well with the puppetry and scale models. Jabba the Hutt's \\"new\\" scene is an abomination; at several points Han Solo clips into him as they move around.  <br /> <br />And change just for the sake of change has never appealed to me. Call me hidebound, but I didn't spend half my life memorizing the dialogue only to be tripped up by a new version of Luke and Yoda chatting on Dagobah. The same information is conveyed; why use an alternate cut? It just distracts me from my enjoyment of the films.  <br /> <br />I guess my only hope is that some other die-hard fan (with more tech-savvy than I possess) will figure out a way to make a DVD of the short-lived remastered VHS version produced in the mid-90s. Meanwhile, I am giving this DVD set 4 stars based in large part on the happy memories it evokes.  More objectively, the hash of \\"improvements\\" Lucas added to the films would make me rate it a 2 or 3.
B00005V0X5|5.0|After being kicked out from Metallica (the best thing that could happen to Mr Mustaine and the Heavy Metal followers by the way), this great High IQ, great thinker and visionary musician put together an awesome project called Megadeth, with the help of Dave Ellefson on bass and two other jazz musicians Mr Samuelson on drums and Mr Poland on lead guitar, speed sound has born and they recorded this amazing album full of the ideas that time ago Dave wanted to develop in Metallica and just a few times he had the chance and the aproval from this band to include in Metallicas sound , after that however Metallica stole some of Mustaines ideas to include in their albums like the track \\"the four horsemen\\" wich originally was called \\"mechanix\\" wich lyrics and music were composed by Dave, Metallica changed the lyrics and the music remained the same despite Mustaine asked them not to record any of the lyrics or music that were his work because he wanted this compositions for his new band after his departure from Metallica, some more of Daves work were included in Metallicas second album , it doesnt matter because Dave Mustaine created a speed metal band more superior than Metallica in many aspects , GnRs Slash has described Megadeth sound as \\"Intelligent Speed Metal\\" and this description definitelly fits in Mr Mustaine work , with Megadeths new release \\"the system has failed\\" Dave has proved once again that he never quits despite adversity after his surprisin recover from a neural dissease that made him retire for a while , this man is a warrior and a remarkable human being <br />HM
B00006AG9J|2.0|This is Tangerine Dream's first album.  It is only 36 minutes long.  Sound quality and mix are not very good. <br /> <br />About half of this album is just noise, with the band members just clanking on stuff or making eerie sounds.  Much of it sounds like one of those Halloween albums of spooky sounds. <br /> <br />The other half is some interesting coherent music, with some interesting trade offs between organ, guitar and drums.  The music is really harsh, churning and metallic.  But, the whole thing sounds like a rip-off of earlier Pink Floyd music, specifcially Saucer Full of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother and Ummagumma.  (Atom Heart Mother and this album would be released at about the same time, but Pink Floyd had been playing variations on Atom Heart Mother for a couple of years). <br /> <br />This album is nothing like later Tangerine Dream album, where they would soften their sound and move towards more electonica and ambient.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am 14 years old, and I have been a Green Day fan since I was 8.  I have all of their albums, and I waited in line this morning to purchase this album, as I did with their last 3 albums.  American Idiot, to me, is a blend of all of Green Day's various styles over the years, from Slappy and 39 Smooth right up to Warning.  It has touches of their softer sounding side, (Wake Me Up When September Ends, Give Me Novacaine,) and the Nimrod era, with the more rock out-able songs like Holiday and Letterbomb.  \\"An Epic Punk Rock Opera.\\"  This isn't my favorite album of Green Day's, but it is definitely a sign that they aren't slowing down any time soon. A must buy for everyone.
B0002OERI0|5.0|If you don't want to be an American Idiot then go out and buy this CD!  All you Green Day for lifers know this CD is amazingly intensely good 'cause you already own it!!  For all you snot nosed high school brat kids who \\"hate your parents\\" and wear Ramones shirts, but weren't out of kindergarten when Dookie came out, go get Green Day's original stuff to know where they've been because only then can you appreciate how amazing this CD is! <br /> <br />Green Day and the Offspring gave punk a rebirth ten years ago (thank God!).  With American Idiot, Green Day show all these new up and comers like NFG and Good Charlotte just how powerful, real, and musical punk music can be.  Let's see if 10 years from now A Simple Plan is still recording.  They won't be.  But if American Idiot is any idea Green Day have many more decades of ruling he punk throne. <br /> <br />Honestly it's a great album and well worth the wait.  Thank God someone stole those master tapes two years ago otherwise we might not have had this!
1591840562|5.0|Life is short, time is short, and one's time is better spent on 'doing' the dream than spent on reading how.   <br /> <br />Guy's new book is the exception.  A very quick read that cuts to the chase and provides insight that every Entrepreneur with or without a 'plan' should read, ponder, and then read again. <br /> <br />I would compare \\"Art of the Start\\" to the best 30 second elevator pitch I have ever heard.  The content is captivating and the message is clear - I'll invest!! (well I did - $18, and I feel I should send Guy more money)

0393035158|5.0|I felt an enormous sense of relief reading this book. Sam Harris has put into words all the things that need to be said about organized religion--specifically Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--but are currently taboo. Not only is the book clear as a bell, well-researched, and thought-provoking, it's also a page-turner. The man is an excellent writer, and \\"The End of Faith\\" is full of wry comments and practical examples that made me laugh out loud. While Harris' call to action--he suggests that people come to their senses and abandon blind faith--isn't likely to occur, that doesn't mean he's not right. Someone has to say it, and his book is a bright light in the wilderness.
0312263120|4.0|This is nothing along the lines of the Robert Langdon books; it's something else entirely.  A thoroughly enjoyable read with likeable characters and an interesting plot line.  I really don't know what more you can ask from a work on fiction.  I like it.
B000022TSV|5.0|this is the best carmen video, bar none. it has an unbeatable cast. migenes is a miracle as carmen. you won't see a better acted performance. and considering the recording was made before the film, it's amazing how well thought out her singing is, just the right emphasis being placed on every word. remarkable! domingo matches her word for word, and raimondi is a suave and commanding escamillo. the natural setting doesn't always work for opera, but here the open spaces give the performances room to breath, which is important because this IS an opera about freedom, sexual and otherwise. migenes, especially, takes full advantage of this. just look at her habanera, how she dances around, mesmerizing as much with her body language as with her bewitching words. this is how the habanera should be sung. wonderful. and she does the same with her other numbers. <br />this is the best carmen video money can buy.
B00003CXCT|3.0|In reviewing these DVD's, covering the plot strikes me as an exercise in the absurd.  If you don't already know it, you're not going to be buying these DVD's.  Instead, I am going to focus my review on two points of comparison that are particularly relevant.  The first is the comparison of these \\"Special Edition\\" versions of \\"Star Wars\\" to the original films; what's better, what's worse, etc.  The second point of comparison is to the \\"Extended Editions\\" of Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films.  These DVD sets represent the gold standard for excellence in a DVD release, and for any film of \\"Star Wars\\" reputation to be considered successful, it must compare favorably to these sets. <br /> <br />First off, calling these films special editions is something of a misnomer; George Lucas has been emphatic that going forward they are the only editions.  Fans will not have the option of buying the original versions on DVD, so asking whether or not these editions really are special is a critical question.  The answer, unfortunately, is yes and no.  The enhanced special effects and new scenes are a mixed bag, that generally stand well on their own, but which sometimes detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br />\\"A New Hope\\" benefits the most from the changes, largely because it was the most primitive film to begin with.  CGI has been used to great effect to make the spaceport of Mos Eisley look like a bustling metropolis, and an additional scene with Jabba the Hutt has been improved upon since the original 1997 release.  Moreover, the spaceships have a much better look than the original models.  Unfortunately, all of this window dressing causes a problem which plagues the other two films: the addition of 2004 CGI to the films looks great until it is bumped up against 1970's and `80's special effects.  Since Lucas didn't replace everything, the pieces he didn't replace look shabby by comparison.  For example, in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" the AT-AT's look significantly worse, not because they were changed any, but because everything else looks better. <br /> <br />There were also a lot of lost opportunities to improve background elements through the use of CGI.  For example, the interior of the Death Star, and most of the larger ships, feature control panels that consist of randomly flashing lights and big blank pieces of plastic with almost no displays.  It would have been relatively simple to clean these up to the point where they actually look like they perform some sort of function.  In a similar vein, the briefing for the attack on the Death Star in \\"A New Hope\\" still features the same ridiculous Atari style graphic, while the same briefing in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" features a hologram.  It would have been relatively simple to update the former in order to bring some internal consistency to the story, but it was completely overlooked.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the CGI additions look great, and they undeniably fix visual problems with the originals.  However, making only partial fixes has created a movie that feels oddly disjointed and that can be visually comical at times. <br /> <br />As for the second comparison, to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Extended Editions, I have to begin with a caveat: I fully understand that Peter Jackson shot his movies with the understanding of the potentials of the DVD format, an understanding Lucas couldn't have possibly had.  Moreover, Jackson deliberately shot mountains of background information for the sole purpose of releasing it on DVD, and again, Lucas wouldn't have done this.  That said, I found the extras to be rather lacking. <br /> <br />I haven't listened to the commentaries in their entirety, but what I have heard is interesting, even engaging, but rarely entirely fresh.  Though to be fair, how much new can be said about these films?  As for the fourth, bonus disc, the extra features are generally solid, but rather limited.  The excellent documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" is an interesting, if somewhat egotistical, journey through Lucas' struggle to make the films.  It stands up well as a biographical work, and has rightly been airing in a somewhat compressed form on A&E.  However, the other extras really only amount to featurettes, none lasting more than 25 minutes.  A highlight is one dealing with the upcoming Episode III, which deals with the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.  It's not a trailer, and not even really a teaser trailer, but it does show some fighting between Obi-Wan and Anakin in front of a blue screen, and was overall a nice little feature.   <br /> <br />However, there was nothing of any substance about the sets, the wardrobe, the weapons, the ships or the races of Star Wars, and in this regard, this set compares very poorly to Jackson's films.  While Lucas may not have the documentary footage Jackson had, he has twenty-seven years of tightly controlled Star Wars mythos to draw upon, and the opportunities for special features are virtually limitless.  Unfortunately, Lucas chose not to give his fans any. <br /> <br />To be fair, these movies look and sound great; in particular they appear as if they were shot yesterday.  Ultimately though, for arguably the most popular films ever made, I found this set lacking, and frankly, there's no excuse for it.  Lucas could have named his price for these discs, and people would have paid it, and I can only assume that the flaws I have outlined will someday be rectified in a \\"Super Special Edition\\", and that speaks to a greed that demeans what these films mean to so many people.  I have no problem with Lucas tinkering with his films, they are his after all, but failing to do so comprehensively is a glaring oversight at best, and insulting to his fans at worst. <br /> <br />Buy these movies because they look and sound great, and because they are still a ton of fun to watch, but don't expect anything special from this latest and greatest edition. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />

B0002OERI0|4.0|I've been a fan of Green Day since the release of \\"Dookie\\" and, like many others in my generation, have stuck with the band since.  While albums like \\"Insomniac\\" and \\"Nimrod\\" carried the torch, the bands previous album \\"Warning\\" was a let down to fans, while not bad, it was just too different too soon.  We should have seen an album like \\"American Idiot\\" coming, but nobody truely did.   <br /> <br />I know there are some skeptics after the more acousticly driven Green Day came about in 2000, fear not, the band you love is back in full force.  \\"American Idiot\\" truely is a work of art for Green Day from start to finish, it displays the bands obvious maturity without alienating a loyal and loving fanbase.  They've been working hard at this one for nearly four years and it's paid off. <br /> <br />It shouldn't come as a suprise to any Green Day fan that this may very well be your favorite album so far.  It appeals to a vast number of listeners, it's obvious the band had this in mind while creating it.  You'll probably be most taken back by the instruments used throughout, most notably the piano in the middle of the near 10 minute \\"Jesus Of Suburbia.\\" <br /> <br />The four year wait for this album was really worth it, just don't expect \\"Kerplunk\\" or \\"Dookie\\" when you press that play button for the first time.  Not to say it doesn't have sprinklings of their Punk and Alternative sounds throughout, just remember that \\"American Idiot\\" is what it is and you'll be fine. <br /> <br />To clarify, I usually reserve my 5 star ratings for albums that are so good that the 5 stars don't do them justice.  I really wish I could give it a 4 1/2 star rating, but Amazon doesn't allow so alas, 4 it is. <br /> <br />Green Day is back.
B002DEPJB6|4.0|The design of this boxed set is superb. The special features were a bonus, though I was hoping for much more. Commentaries over a few of the episodes would have been nice, as would a few more outtakes, but the set is generally worth the money.<br /><br />As for content, I can echo that it is witty, well-written and equally well-acted by regulars and guest stars alike. A fine production. I would like to point out, however, for those thinking this is a family forum drama, that Lorelai Gilmore stands for everything but family. She made it clear from the beginning that she wants very little to do with her own parents, whom she openly despises, and never wanted to start a family of her own with Rory's father, whom she never married. She can be applauded for opting out of abortion and for raising Rory 'a-la-Murphy Brown' into the young woman we find here in season one. However, Lorelai sets no good example for her blossoming young daughter by hopping into bed with Rory's teacher, ending that relationship abruptly when Rory finds out and flips out, then sleeping with Rory's dad when he happens to pop into town for a quick visit after many years away. At season one's end Lorelai is back in the teachers' sack, hiding the renewed relationship from her daughter. (The lie of omission is still deception.) Rory finds out and flips out again, which only compounds her angst as she tries to determine what LOVE is and if she has it for Dean, who broke up with her after he confessed his love and she did not verbally reciprocate.<br /><br />Having just seen the opening episode for the latest season, I can tell you that season one is the most innocent; it goes quickly down hill from there. Rory is now not only hopping from one bed to another and back again - like her mother - but she is now a full-blown, 'my needs are all that matter' adulteress. Rory's friend Lane, a once sweet but now jaded anti-Christian, when finding out about Rory's latest sex-capade with the now married Dean at Miss Patty's studio, remarks &#34;Miss Patty would be proud!&#34; This current moral attitude is far removed from season one's &#34;Rory's Dance&#34; episode where Dean and Rory innocently fell asleep at Miss Patty's, causing jaws to drop all over Stars Hollow.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the quirky characters of Stars Hollow when they first appeared on our little screens, you should find these 22 episodes well worth watching again. Having seen where this Bedford Falls-ish berg eventually decends, however, has got me considering whether to waste my time and emotions on the remaining seasons.ss Patty's studio, remarks &#34;Miss Patty would be proud!&#34; This current moral attitude is far removed from season one's &#34;Rory's Dance&#34; episode where Dean and Rory innocently fell asleep at Miss Patty's, causing jaws to drop all over Stars Hollow.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the quirky characters of Stars Hollow when they first appeared on our little screens, you should find these 22 episodes well worth watching again.
