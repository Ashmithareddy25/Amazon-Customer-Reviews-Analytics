B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac's \\"All Eyez On Me\\" stands out among countless other hip hop albums as a classic, and for good reason. It's very hard to make a 27 track album consistently enjoyable, but 2Pac did it. While there are some tracks that aren't as great as others, even those songs are light years better than anything out now. I've owned this album for years and manages to get heavy play to this day. Legendary album from a legendary artist.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|So, let me first say that this cooler fits the FM1 socket from AMD. I know, because I am using it on my A8-3870K APU. It has a max TDP (the highest power the CPU can be before the cooler can't cool fast enough) of 180 watts, and putting it on my 120 watt overclocked APU allows for more overclocking (the standard TDP of this chip is 100 watts). The fan it comes with moves about 70 CFM, so if you are looking for a replacement fan that's just as good as the one that comes with it, then there's a good starting point. I replaced the fan with a 40 CFM blue light-up case fan and the temps never get over 38C, even when running Furmark (an incredibly system intensive video bench-mark tool). This is important, because for those who don't know, APU's have the CPU and the GPU on one chip, so the heatsink was keeping the GPU cool, even with a slow fan. A friend of mine has the Corsair H60, one of Corsair's liquid-cooling systems. Upon a comparisson, I learned that this cooler keeps my APU cooler than his would. The TDP is higher for the Evo 212+ than it is for the much more expensive H60. This is a very good product, and I recommend it to anyone who needs a good cooler, and has the room in their case to put it.<br /><br />Edit: I have learned that the copper/aluminum heat sink alone is good enough for the APU when it is in it's low power state. The fan frequently turns off, meaning the air flow through the case alone is good enough to keep the processor cool. Yay passive cooling!
B000GCFO0S|1.0|If you want this movie for the first time, then go for it -- this review has no reflection on the movie itself.<br /><br />I have the DVD movie and it's pretty clean on the DVD.  The DVD even has a bonus disk that gives you all the commentary, interviews, making of, origins, etc.  This blu-ray package does not.<br />Seller is false advertising here.  I am 100% completely disappointed because I bought this movie thinking that it would provide me the extras that I wanted now I opened the blu-ray thinking that it had it and it's completely UN-returnable now.<br /><br />Thanks false advertiser!
030758836X|4.0|Did Nick kill his wife?  A few pages, I am sure he did, then a few pages and I have some doubt, then back to thinking he did.  It is a roller coaster.  The author has a great insight into how two people in a marriage see their relationship in entirely different ways. That gave the story a lot of depth for me. I found it a good read if you like psychological thrillers.

0393064476|3.0|This is a monograph describing, among many interesting digressions, the recovery of Lucretius by Poggio Bracciolini and the Epicurean philosophy espoused by Lucretius.  It should be taken as work of part historical narrative, part philosphical exposition, and part personal testament.  I listed to this as an audiobook and found it very enjoyable.  The description of Poggio's personal history, his passion for books, and the arcana surrounding ancient manuscripts is found nowhere else with such enthusiasm and passion.  I also liked his very personal narration of how he discovered Lucretius as a student, and what his philosophy meant to him and how it helped him with his life.  Greenblatt, if I'm not mistaken, also wrote a similar article on this issue that was recently published in the New Yorker Magazine.<br />Yes, of course, Greenblatt overstates the importance of Lucretius in the currents of Western thought.  Most of Roman history is strangely silent about him, and he had in my opinion not a huge influence in Western thought.  Other philosophers were far more influential.  I must also confess that I personally find Epicureanism to be not very appealing.  But the poem is still a dazzling performance, and all educated people should be familiar with it.  Greenblatt does a good job at doing this.  Strongly recommended.
034580404X|2.0|What is all the hype? I stupidly bought the trilogy!<br />Terrible writing, predictable plot and steamy sex scenes....sounds like porn-feel like I bought a bad porn movie in a book, I made it through the 4th chapter and am giving the books away. Guess I need a little more substance in my reading.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well, with all the hype of this trilogy I just HAD to read it. In the beginning you're very curious and a bit turned on really. It's odd because I don't consider myself interested in S&M in any form. But, in a nutshell...boy is this trilogy repetitive! The SAME sex routine...Mr. Grey, Miss Steele, Mrs. Grey and it goes again. I found myself skimming through the same ole sex and wooing scenes. I actually got bored with the S&M. Initially, their need for each other was exciting, but not so much later.<br /><br />I did enjoy when they threw in something different like the psycho guy after Christian and Ana. So, I consider these three books a package of curiosity. I didn't mind reading any of the three, but I wouldn't read them again. If you read book ONE then you must continue and read the next two. I like the way it was wrapped up and wish the author had put more of the life of Christian etc in the last book vs more of the same ole routine.
B008FOB124|1.0|Not their best effort.  Electronic synthesizers fail to sound majestic instead sound like Brian Eno on codeine cough syrup, stuffed up with a cold.  Yes Brandon Perry has a magnificent voice but the lyrics sound like McGuffy's Reader.  Mr. Perry!  Tear down that synthesizer and go unplugged.

0374275637|5.0|I have read the kindle edition of his book, and I find it quite amusing and informative. And, I can recommend it to people who want to learn about the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" we make decisions. Kahnemann is elegantly putting his words, in an understandable, and in layman's words, and his message reaches thereby a larger audience than just academics and professionals so that we all can understand the underlying mechanisms of the flaws, fallacies, and correctness of human decision making.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love this app! if you like this one too also try where's my water. I wish there were more levels
B0071DJZZA|5.0|A really enjoyable read.  Great characters, exciting action and well thought out.  If a book entertains me, keeps me wanting to turn the pages and wipes my mind of my daily grind then I am a happy customer!  I found myself cheering for the success of the characters and look forward to reading the others in the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought that it was going to be about two people who fall in love with each other and stay together for a long time,  living happily and all that (because to be honest, I'm kind of a sucker for those types of stories). However, after finishing it, I'm glad do say that it didn't have a general fairy tale like ending. Rather, it was like a slap in the face-- the good kind that makes you realize things that you would have been blind to before. This book is heartbreakingly beautiful, and is definitely worth reading --at least once, if not many, many,  many more times than that.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very well written, couldn't stop reading the series, a real page turner! This series is not another love story, it's about a rebellion in a post apocalyptic world.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It totally fun. I may be a kid but I know how to pick a good game
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I have to admit I enjoyed reading these books.  They are gripping and addictive.  Yes, there are flaws in the writing, repetitive phrases, some annoying parts, but then writers surely can't please all their audience.  Christian Grey is indeed too good to be true, but this is fiction and I did get swept up into the story and found myself at times unable to put the book down.  It took me out of my daily grind, and for that I was very grateful.  This is high and hot romance, with thriller elements to it aswell.

0767819543|5.0|8/15/12  Script and Cast show excellent ability of casting and adaptation of book by author and film director Walter Moreira Salles Jr....It maintains focus to its plot throughout which makes it unique to many films which tend to be longer in length, but often get caught up in subplots and as a result lose some of the 'brillance of simplicity' .

B000002B35|4.0|I do not share the views expressed here about the outstanding quality of this audio disc. The DVD is a truly remarkable recording both audio and video. This audio disc are from different concerts captured in the DVD. I am also disappointed they dropped 'Take It Back' from the audio set. The biggest fault of this disc is the sound seems \\"remote\\", the recording especially the vocals sound as if came from speakers and not 'directly', as if you're listening to the concert next door. Nevertheless Gilmour's leadership, similar to Phil Collins with Genesis, has allowed us to have these fine documents (Division Bell & Pulse live discs) that mark the end of a truly great band.
0345803493|3.0|found myself skipping forward a bunch trying to find a story line.  the erotic passages, so to speak, were predictive, and became boring,  pun intended - anticlimatic
1442419814|5.0|This is a series made up of 4 books about a society obsessed with beauty, and is on the top of my list. What makes this one great is the fact that on the outside this future seems kind of perfect. Everyone is beautiful and there is no more poverty, but there is a price to perfection. Tally and Shay go on the adventure of their lives and discover a dark secret that brings their perfect world crashing down. This book, along with many dystopian books, is perfect for girls and boys because of the action and adventure along with a bit a light romance.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|really fun to play doesn't have any problems u really should get it its worth it and its also free.
0425263908|5.0|I've been wanting to read this book for awhile and when it was compared to the Fifty Shades book, I thought I better check this out! I'm glad I did.  Although the entire plot is different from 50 Shades, it still involves a strong male who is wealthy and controlling. Gideon (although the name is silly) is a total alpha male and I like that Eva was well off and could hold her own if she wanted. It's a must read for all those contemporary romance lovers out there. (18+)
0394818237|5.0|This is the second Richard Scarry book I have bought for my grandchildren, age 3 and 5 - and they love these books. They were favorites of my children when they we young, and I am delighted these wonderful books haven't lost their charm for this generation. My daughter was thrilled with the book and said that its a great book to read at bedtime. The big book has great illustrations and short text on each page. perfect for young minds.I love buying books on Amazon and buy many for myself, as I am an avid reader.
B004FN16DS|4.0|A clear, accessible discussion of the holes in the free-market ideology, from a development economist at Cambridge University. Each chapter starts with \\"What they tell you,\\" a summary of the free-market argument, and is followed by \\"What they don't tell you,\\" the other side of the issue.
B0058RN85O|5.0|This is a really funny show! My niece gave me the first season and I was really taken away by it. It is snortingly hilarious and I've learned NOT to eat popcorn while watching it as it usually ends up flying out of my nose as I double over in laughter.<br />If anyone out there wants a great TV show at their fingertips they should fork over their dough and buy this baby. Watching it live can be a real bummer with all the commercials so its worth it to buy it.<br />The show sounds simple enough as it is about a five person family and their relatives. The father is an adorable dork who loves his wife and kids more than he does himself. He thinks hes cool but hes really a lovable cad that I can't get enough of, while his wife is a hot control freak who micromanages everything. The oldest daughter is a queen with a dolt of a boyfriend, while her younger sister is a brainiac who can't figure out why everyone loves her older sister so much. The son is a dimwitted little prankster who is screamingly appealing. Throw them and their relatives in a pot and stir it up and you have the best comedy show that TV has seen in years. We watched this second season in like three days as it was even better than the first. This is truly \\"feel good\\" TV so buy it if you want some good vibes! :)
B00846REIS|4.0|After reading the Fifty Shades series I was left wanting something along the same lines. This was pretty much it. Easy to read and ended to quickly for me. I like the story and it does remind me of the Fifty Shades story some but Eva is more mature and isn't so innocent acting. I am really looking forward to the next one.
B000Q66Q9C|5.0|I love all three of these movies, they are simply to die for. I would recommend them to anyone. My favorite is Peter Pan, which takes the favorite Disney cartoon to real life.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|EXCELLENT!!! Award winning performances and dialogue. The film draws you in and awakens emotions. Moving, touching, simply fantastic. I think I am a \\"hard\\" critic of movies, and I think this one is just great. One of the best I have seen in years. Not to be missed...
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Steve Vai is one of the most amazing guitar players and composers of all time and The Story Of Light is his new album that unleashes his intense skills for our musical enjoyment. Like most albums from Steve Vai, The Story Of Light is an artwork from a musician aiming to achieve the best he is capable of both in creativity and performance. Steve Vai surrounds himself with awesome musicians that bring life to his musical creations rather than trying to take the glory all himself. On this album he has got amazing drumming from Jeremy Colson who also nailed the previous Steve Vai album, groove master and technician Philip Bynoe on bass, and long time collaborator Dave Weiner also helping on guitar. The performances are stunning, the sound and production is huge, but most importantly the music is unique and although it hits you immediately there are lots of layers to discover with repeat listening. Picking highlights is pointless in an album of this quality so all I can say is listen to this album if you are a fan of guitar virtuosity that focuses on creating memorable music. Steve Vai you are going to be remembered for what you have achieved in this life...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Just finished Art of Racing in the Rain and was so happy about it. I knew by the things I heard that it was good, and well, I also had a biased view since I know the agency that took it on and I figured, if they are going to swear by a book, then it has to be great. So in result though, I had high expectations. I heard it was good, in a dogs perspective, and would make me cry. What you can't put into words when someone pitches this book to you to read is how strong all elements of this story are. I was surprised at how well this was told, how heart-wrenching and soft and strong and painfully this was told. To see it in a dogs eyes was not what made it so wonderful, it was having the story be told in eyes of someone who longs so painfully to fix everything, to just say what he knows, to take away the pain and the problems, but unfortunately never has that ability. To have no voice, no say, except a few feeble attempts to show in gestures -a bark, a nuzzle, a poop in the foyer- what he thinks and what he wants the characters to do. It was beautifully told, and the elements of racing, of a dog desperate to be in a human body but doing everything he can in the body he has, and the greatest element of all : perseverance. This story is all about the good that comes when you never give up something worth fighting for. I definitely recommend it, I think anyone would enjoy this, but I suggest you read the whole thing somewhere you won't feel shame in a few tears.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicting. ever since its been on my kindle I cant stop playing. so freaking awesome. great<br />game.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is a good game, but I do think it is as great as other reviews. I only play 1 player off-line so perhaps it is because I am missing out on the best part. As for the Campaign mode it is a bit too easy and while I think the foundation of the game is solid I just never really got sucked in enough.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I am a Star Trek fan from day one when it premiered on TV.<br /><br />Here was a TV show with intelligence, wit, characterization, thoughtful story lines, good actors who had real chemistry, and the cheesiest cardboard sets you could imagine.<br /><br />What's not to like? It spun off many equally entertaining shows and has inspired the imaginations of many, some of whom became scientists and even went to work for NASA.<br /><br />Fast forward to THIS film and we have lack of intelligence, mostly witlessness, a vague attempt at characterization, an impossible to believe story line, good actors with some degree of chemistry and enough CGI graphics to distract you from all its many faults.<br /><br />So what's to like? If it spins off a sequel it will mean the end of civilization as we know it, and if it inspires anyone to apply to NASA based on the science in  this film, NASA will bounce them out the door!<br /><br />Well, I'll try to say something nice because I actually like the movie, but only on the most superficial level. That's because the film is so superficial, any attempt at actually thinking about it gives me a headache.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The actors in general are likeable, if a bit over the top at times, especially:<br /><br />Chris Pine as a young and thoroughly rebellious James Tiberius Kirk. He brings plenty of energy to the role, although he's riding mostly on bravado and testosterone. Unfortunately, he doesn't look even remotely like William Shatner.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto does a good job as a young Spock (Spock V2.0)and looks the part much more than Pine looks like Kirk. (Must be the ears.)<br /><br />Leonard Nimoy returns as older Spock (Spock V1.0) and he's always a treat, though WHY he got involved in this mess is \\"highly illogical\\".<br /><br />Karl Urban gives a nice turn as an earlier and less grouchy McCoy. I like him much better than I did DeForest Kelly!<br /><br />Simon Pegg gives us a Scotty that James Doohan would find hard to recognize, but he is entertaining and engaging enough. But, of course, he still can't get the ships engines to function when they should. Some things never change.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana gives us a new Uhura, one who is gorgeous (as was Nichelle Nichols) but this time her only ground breaking attribute is that she is the most brilliant linguist in the galaxy and can give Spock 2.0 an amazing lip lock on the transporter pad. It's not her fault, it's the dang script!<br /><br />So, we have some good actors - necessary for entertainment, but is there anything else in this film to entertain?<br /><br />Yes. If you like CGI and senseless cut-clip action. If you like your movies fast and dumb, this one's for you.<br /><br />If you like to understand what is going on, then, maybe not.<br /><br />And that's the problem with this movie. It makes absolutely no sense. Yet it is a conundrum, because in spite of its massive \\"illogic\\", it has entertainment value. You just have to put your brain on hold, and forget anything you might know about Star Trek the TV franchise, and science, to enjoy it.<br /><br />Basically, it's a roller coaster ride of a movie, all hills and valleys at breakneck speed with no purpose other than to give a thrill, and certainly with no intention of carrying on the Star Trek tradition. It's about as much about Star Trek as \\"Superman the Ride\\" is about the \\"Man of Steel\\".<br /><br />All sci-fi requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but this movie takes it to a level that is hard to beat. It seems to totally ignore the details and nuances of the ST Universe in favor of senseless thrill after senseless thrill.<br /><br />Here are some examples, and why it seems like they got the script from a classroom full of third graders who were making it up as they went along while on a sugar high:<br /><br />**** SPOILER ALERT *****<br /><br />The crux of the matter is that the Star of the Romulus solar system is going Super Nova. Bad, bad star.<br /><br />Okay,so far, we can go with that, it's been known to happen in other places in our actual Universe.<br /><br />Now in the original ST Universe (which tried to follow science a lot more closely, while pushing the envelope), the Romulans are a pretty bright bunch. For one thing they run an Empire, for another, they have developed cloaking technology that not even the Federation can figure out, and finally, they drive their space ships based on a Quantum Singularity (which sometimes gets them into trouble with the physical Universe).<br /><br />So a group of rather bright folks like the Romulans... they're caught by surprise by their star going Super Nova? Nowhere in their own vast Empire can they find ANYONE who has a clue about this? And, just how rapidly does a star go Super Nova? Is it like, one minute we have a star, the next minute BOOM?<br /><br />Well, apparently, in THIS ST Universe, the Romulans are too dumb to notice the problem until, of course, it is too late. Yeah, this is TOTALLY logical!<br /><br />Okay, to make it worse, the ONLY folks in the Universe who can help defeat the evil sudden Super Nova are the ... wait for it... Vulcans! Well, THAT certainly makes sense! Vulcans are even smarter than Romulans (though not smart enough to stay out of this silly movie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Vulcans are busy with something or other, so they can only send an aging Mr. Spock in a tiny space ship that looks like a gyroscope on steroids, with the magical wonder substance \\"Red Matter\\". to deal with the evil Super Nova.<br /><br />Makes perfect sense to me! One tiny drop of Red Matter is SO potent that it will turn a giant Super Nova into... please, wait for it... a black hole! (Hmmm, things seem to be going from bad to worse).<br /><br />Who came up with this insanity? But hang on the plot get worse.<br /><br />It turns out that one gigantic Romulan ship, a mining ship that, for some reason not explained, looks like shredded driftwood, has escaped the Super Nova, but only to see it consume the wonderful planet Romulus, killing every living soul on the planet.<br /><br />The ship is captained by a character named \\"Nero\\", who has more tattoos than a tattoo parlor and wears a long leather trench coat (in a space ship). He is absolutely furious at... the Federation!<br /><br />Yes, he has decided that the Super Nova is the fault of the Federation, and in particular, Mr. Spock, because he arrived too late with his magic \\"Red Matter\\" to prevent the Super Nova by creating a much safer black hole. As we all know, Vulcan is a member of the Federation, so in reverse logic, let's see now... Bad Spock, bad Vulcan, bad Federation, dumb, dumb -- er, I mean poor, poor, Romulans.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I get it.<br /><br />The name Nero and the Trench coat are throwbacks to \\"The Matrix\\", of course, for no other reason that, well, he -- Neo of the Matrix looked spiffy in that movie - except he had hair, so \\"Nero\\" looks like a \\"Neo\\" wannabe.<br /><br />Moving right along (as this movie does, it at least has a very fast pace), after the tardy Spock creates the Back Hole, he and Nero and the super gigantic driftwood spaceship get sucked into the thing, and, surprise, surprise, go back in time to when life was simpler and the Federation was just about to launch the first version of the Star Ship Enterprise. But they appear in a distant part of the galaxy where there just happens to be one of those pesky Federation star ships. Oh joy, Nero can begin taking insane revenge!<br /><br />(One would think he'd instead go to Romulus to warn them of the upcoming Super Nova, but Noooo, that would make sense!)<br /><br />Nero destroys this first Federation space ship (Spock is off somewhere or confused or something so he can't prevent it... he's useless as a super hero) which kills among others, the parents of James Tiberius Kirk, who, like the baby Kal-El of Superman fame, escapes the carnage and winds up on Earth. Hooray!<br /><br />There he grows up as a rebellious young man who, for some reason decides to join Star Fleet. Yeah, every rebellious youth wants to be in the military... it's the spiffy uniforms, you know, real chick magnets.<br /><br />At this point it goes from bad to worse, so much so that I don't want to rehash it. But with just this little bit, anyone can see what a dreg this movie plot is.<br /><br />They try to excuse most of it by saying that this is an \\"Alternate\\" Universe (but not the one with Evil Kirk and Evil Spock like we saw in the TV series). As the saying goes, \\"That dog won't hunt\\" for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1. The Star Ship Enterprise is bigger and looks vastly more advanced than the original Enterprise, or even the later 1701 series (as in STNG and the earlier Star Trek movies).<br /><br />2. The Star Ship Enterprise has a bridge inspired by a department store, or an Apple iPod. Everything is White and LED Blue, and bright enough to blind you. That's because these are the GOOD guys, and good guys always wear white!<br /><br />3. Nero's advanced from-the-future Romulan Ship is even bigger than the bigger Enterprise, but apparently the Romulans have no concept of interior design, in fact they don't even have interior lighting to speak of. So this ship is BLACK. Bad guys always wear black.<br /><br />4. The main engine area of Star Ship Enterprise looks like a cross between a waste water treatment plant and a brewery (actually, it was filmed in a brewery and it seems like the writers made an ample sampling of the product). I guess the Dilithium crystals have to be soaked in water (or beer) in order to work right, and maybe the water (or beer) is needed to cool down the anti-matter injectors or something. Yeah, if I was building a space ship, I'd fill it with tanks of water (or beer).<br /><br />5. Nero's ship has something of a plumbing problem. There's a foot of water everywhere. I would suspect that the toilets backed up, but as everyone knows, there are no toilets on space ships. However, the vast amount of water may account for Nero's bad attitude. He's probably suffering from trench foot from standing in that water for so long.<br /><br />6. When Nero and his wonder ship attack the planet Vulcan (intent -- turn it into a black hole to teach those tardy Vulcans a lesson) they drop this \\"mining drill\\" platform into the upper atmosphere. The Vulcans are, of course, so taken by surprise, and so incredibly incompetent, that they have NO space ships or planetary defenses (thus taking pacifism to an extreme that borders on foolishness) that they are powerless and must ask Earth to send star ships to help.<br /><br />7. Nero gets Captain Pike to reveal Earth's super secret defense codes by making him eat a bug. No, really! Okay, that one's been done before in the \\"Wrath of Kahn\\", only they stuck the bug in someone's ear. Both are gross and insulting to bugs.<br /><br />8. Ensign Chekov is 17 years old. Not old enough to have a driver's license, but old enough to pilot a star ship. And the Federation is exploiting minors, which is only fair, because Nero is exploiting miners.<br /><br />9. Kirk and friends sky dive into the atmosphere of Vulcan wearing only skin tight jump suits and what look like bicycle helmets. They don't build up any heat during the rapid descent, heck, they don't even smoke (smoking is bad)! I bet NASA would love to know what that material is!<br /><br />10. Spock gets mad at Kirk (almost everyone gets mad at Kirk at least once during this movie) and throws him off the ship, abandoning him on an ice planet called Delta Vega. Okay, I guess they haven't got a brig on the massive new Enterprise -- too many beer -- er, water tanks I think. And Spock was angry, after all. Does Starfleet allow a junior officer acting as Captain the authority to throw someone off the dang space ship? (Regulations, what regulations?)<br /><br />11. On Delta Vega, Kirk is chased by a toothy sort of polar bear-walrus thing, which is obviouslyhungry -- or Kirk got it mad just by being there. Fair enough, go chase Kirk. Well, in no time a BIG, red, other thing with four toothy lips (which look a lot like the sand worms in Dune), probably also hungry, bursts through an ice pack and grabs the polar bear thing in its \\"jaws\\". Now, does it EAT the bigger polar bear thing? Of course not. It spits it out and chases Kirk! That's because Kirk probably, like all humans, tastes like chicken, and who can resist a nice chicken dinner? Or, Kirk made it mad at him.<br /><br />12. Kirk eventually gets onto Nero's ship and has a clear shot at him so he could disable him or outright kill him. Does he? No, he asks Nero to surrender. Uh, yeah, that's realistic! Of course, in the time it takes for him to do that, Nero jumps Kirk and we have a smashing good fight!

I better stay here, it makes more sense!p as a rebellious young man who, for some reason decides to join Star Fleet. Yeah, every rebellious youth wants to be in the military... it's the spiffy uniforms, you know, real chick magnets.<br /><br />At this point it goes from bad to worse, so much so that I don't want to rehash it. But with just this little bit, anyone can see what a dreg this movie plot is.<br /><br />They try to excuse most of it by saying that this is an \\"Alternate\\" Universe (but not the one with Evil Kirk and Evil Spock like we saw in the TV series). As the saying goes, \\"That dog won't hunt\\" for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1. The Star Ship Enterprise is bigger and looks vastly more advanced than the original Enterprise, or even the later 1701 series (as in STNG and the earlier Star Trek movies).<br /><br />2. The Star Ship Enterprise has a bridge inspired by a department store, or an Apple iPod. Everything is White and LED Blue, and bright enough to blind you. That's because these are the GOOD guys, and good guys always wear white!<br /><br />3. Nero's advanced from-the-future Romulan Ship is even bigger than the bigger Enterprise, but apparently the Romulans have no concept of interior design, in fact they don't even have interior lighting to speak of. So this ship is BLACK. Bad guys always wear black.<br /><br />4. The main engine area of Star Ship Enterprise looks like a cross between a waste water treatment plant and a brewery (actually, it was filmed in a brewery and it seems like the writers made an ample sampling of the product). I guess the Dilithium crystals have to be soaked in water (or beer) in order to work right, and maybe the water (or beer) is needed to cool down the anti-matter injectors or something. Yeah, if I was building a space ship, I'd fill it with tanks of water (or beer).<br /><br />5. Nero's ship has something of a plumbing problem. There's a foot of water everywhere. I would suspect that the toilets backed up, but as everyone knows, there are no toilets on space ships. However, the vast amount of water may account for Nero's bad attitude. He's probably suffering from trench foot from standing in that water for so long.<br /><br />6. When Nero and his wonder ship attack the planet Vulcan (intent -- turn it into a black hole to teach those tardy Vulcans a lesson) they drop this \\"mining drill\\" platform into the upper atmosphere. The Vulcans are, of course, so taken by surprise, and so incredibly incompetent, that they have NO space ships or planetary defenses (thus taking pacifism to an extreme that borders on foolishness) that they are powerless and must ask Earth to send star ships to help.<br /><br />7. Nero gets Captain Pike to reveal Earth's super secret defense codes by making him eat a bug. No, really! Okay, that one's been done before in the \\"Wrath of Kahn\\", only they stuck the bug in someone's ear. Both are gross and insulting to bugs.<br /><br />8. Ensign Chekov is 17 years old. Not old enough to have a driver's license, but old enough to pilot a star ship. And the Federation is exploiting minors, which is only fair, because Nero is exploiting miners.<br /><br />9. Kirk and friends sky dive into the atmosphere of Vulcan wearing only skin tight jump suits and what look like bicycle helmets. They don't build up any heat during the rapid descent, heck, they don't even smoke (smoking is bad)! I bet NASA would love to know what that material is!<br /><br />10. Spock gets mad at Kirk (almost everyone gets mad at Kirk at least once during this movie) and throws him off the ship, abandoning him on an ice planet called Delta Vega. Okay, I guess they haven't got a brig on the massive new Enterprise -- too many beer -- er, water tanks I think. And Spock was angry, after all. Does Starfleet allow a junior officer acting as Captain the authority to throw someone off the dang space ship? (Regulations, what regulations?)<br /><br />11. On Delta Vega, Kirk is chased by a toothy sort of polar bear-walrus thing, which is obviouslyhungry -- or Kirk got it mad just by being there. Fair enough, go chase Kirk. Well, in no time a BIG, red, other thing with four toothy lips (which look a lot like the sand worms in Dune), probably also hungry, bursts through an ice pack and grabs the polar bear thing in its \\"jaws\\". Now, does it EAT the bigger polar bear thing? Of course not. It spits it out and chases Kirk! That's because Kirk probably, like all humans, tastes like chicken, and who can resist a nice chicken dinner? Or, Kirk made it mad at him.<br /><br />12. Kirk eventually gets onto Nero's ship and has a clear shot at him so he could disable him or outright kill him. Does he? No, he asks Nero to surrender. Uh, yeah, that's realistic! Of course, in the time it takes for him to do that, Nero jumps Kirk and we have a smashing good fight! Nero is a champion fighter, evidenced by his super strength in spite of wearing that cumbersome trench coat. It must be cold on his ship.<br /><br />13. Kirk wins the fight and rescues Captain Pike. Pike is apparently held down to a table with duct tape. (Did we run out of budget here?)<br /><br />14. Skipping ahead (because it gets even sillier) we wind up with:<br /><br />Spock saves Earth from the mining drill by shooting it to bits with his gyroscope space ship's lasers (er- phasers).

034580404X|4.0|I received the books in the perfect amount of time, and much cheaper then buying them from the book store. Just finished 50 shades of grey and could not put it down, can't wait to start the others.
B00846REIS|2.0|I was prepared to like this book because I do enjoy romances with strong Alpha males with or without D/s. Unfortunately this book didn't have much of any of that, romance, alpha male or D/s. I don't know what to say really other than that this book felt like it was written as one type of book then the D/s elements were added later to ride the Fifty Shades popularity. The knock off cover should have tipped me off. Here's what bothered me the most and why I say don't waste your money. There is nothing to like about either Gideon or Eva. They are both whiny and if two people were meant to NOT be together it's the two of them. Normally I wouldn't be able to understand what a filthy rich, powerful man would see in a young woman with no confidence who is so high maintenance. Then I realized that he had no confidence either and was also high maintenance. The D/s was thrown in at the end, almost as an afterthought. It is totally unbelievable that a man who repeatedly says things like, I f*&^%ed up again, please don't leave me, could ever be a Dom. Coming from such a troubled background, I would have expected her to have so much more understanding and empathy for his troubles. She said she did repeatedly but when he didn't do exactly what she wanted when she wanted she would run. And then the book claims she's a submissive. Huh? I won't even go into the fact that the first week on the job she is sleeping with the client. Sorry but it's a real pet peeve of mine when young women make stupid moves like that and it's all fine and dandy with the boss. Another pet peeve is when someone with a background of sexual abuse instantly becomes multiorgasmic. Sorry but this book pressed my buttons and not the good ones!
086571701X|5.0|This great little book had everything I needed for getting started with a home aquaponics gardening system. It's well written and has lots of easy-to-understand drawings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the trilogy! I have seen a lit of bad reviews, but I can not see why. Yes there are similarities to Twilight in these books, but if you read about this author you find see did write this with Twilight in mind.  This is s great erotic romsnce trilogy.  I LOVE ME SOME CHRISTIAN GREY!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Compelling premise, GREAT character development.<br /><br />I was a little worried originally about buying an \\"Indie\\" book, but this book has better quality writing than most major publishing house books. I didn't see any typos, and every sentence was written in a way that didn't trip me up as a reader.  If the Indie concern is holding you back, press the 'buy' button right now.<br /><br />The series is definitely set up for additional books, so be prepared to invest time and thought into this series.<br /><br />I'd rate this as the second most addicting read ever for me. (First place goes to \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\")
0439023513|3.0|I was so excited about finishing the series I couldn't wait to finish this book.  The book in a word.  RUSHED!!!!!  The ending could have been so much better.  I would have waited for God knows how long for this book and it could have been so much better.  All I have to say is if they make a movie with this book that this will be one of those that doesn't stick close to the book.  The book was more about how war destroys peoples psyche's than how the characters should have been developed.  The general idea of the book was a great idea which is why I gave it 3 stars but it was disappointing to say the least.  Character deaths and emotions were extremely down played.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it's a pretty Cool game but not the best city building game but its free so it doesn't matter. dbfdt
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so cool and fun and I love this game and its so hard to beet its so long to and fun.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I started watching this and boy, its really fun to sing to. I can't wait to go on a cross country rode trip and belt out the tunes from this film! Dick Van Dyke fan, loved him in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang too. Julie Andrews wow what a lady! She looks so pretty in this film.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app for you.could need real money and a lot of friends but very fun and cool with all different food

1469984202|5.0|As soon as I finished the first novella I was hooked.  I wanted to know more.  I liked how the first three novella's were very distinct and showed the silo from different points of view.  But then I also liked how book 4 and 5 were a continuation of Juliette's story.<br /><br />I read some reviews of people who didn't like the book's name.  I disagree.  I think once you understood how \\"wool\\" fit into the story it worked.<br /><br />This book reminded me of a classic sci-fi book.  Howey's version of the dystopian future reminded me of Bradbury and Asimov.  At first appearance the story seemed to be simple but as you read more a beautiful complexity became visible.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|We purchased for our great grandson Keagen..he loves Duplos..when we go to visit, he takes his Poppa by the hand and says lets go to my room to play.  He always builds something from all his Legos that we purchased via Amazon.  His favorite toys ever.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim, not sure who Caitlin Moran was. But I was sold after just the first page. Moran has become one of my top five favorite feminists.<br /><br />I love this book. I'm a young feminist, but I've known how I feel about equality for a long time now. My knowledge before Moran came from books that I love, but are focused on a different generation (i.e. Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, etc.). How to Be a Women is the perfect book for the modern feminist. Moran is intelligent, edgy, kind, and hilarious. You just can't go wrong with this book.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|This is a film of the book by John Le Carr&eacute;, previously serialized by the BBC. Now I have enjoyed reading Le Carr&eacute; and the TV series was exciting but I cannot get enthusiastic about this film. I thought the direction was very muddled. The plot (this won't give away anything important) is about the efforts to track down a `mole' in the upper echelons of the British Secret Service. The whole film jumps back and forth between the present and the past, and I was never sure exactly which I was watching. One of the protagonists gets shot in the end (as a traitor?) but another is dispatched to Moscow and yet another to Siberia. Were they all traitors? Was it in fact a conspiracy? I just thought the whole thing was a disorganised mess. The two stars are for the authentic Cold War atmosphere and the quality of the acting: but -1* for the direction.
B004LSO6YI|4.0|Beautifully illustrated movie of what it's like to love someone and not be able to have them. Fell in love with this movie, could relate to it so much. A must see!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|While I hesitate to give a five star review since I will reserve those for the all time great books, this book is deserving of four stars.  The story grabs you and doesn't let go.  It takes you on a journey of a man through the eyes of his dog.  The writing was interesting and never dull.  Just the right length with an ending that leaves you satisfied.  I would recommend this book to anyone, dog lover or not.
0142407542|4.0|This is the sequel to The Gruffalo--who was also afraid of the Big Bad Mouse.  Both the book and DVD are nicely done.  The story isn't very long, but is cute and the video is nicely illustrated and fun to watch.  The snake, owl, and fox have some similarities to the Big Bad Mouse, but not quite...<br /><br />I received a copy in exchange for my honest opinion.
B008OOYALE|1.0|this is just like dinolife, and they're trying to get me to spend real money. pretty boring app. I don't like it.
1400052181|5.0|This book is such an exceptional work. Sometimes I had to remind myself that it is non-fiction, very informational and entertaining at the same time. I would highly recommend this book - reader beware - very difficult to put this book down.
0439023491|4.0|Great Read! It starts off a little slow but it definitely keep guessing. I could not put it down after the halfway point.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The new Sony headset works great with my ipod...much better than my previous maxell phones.  The sound is much better.  My hope is that they prove to be more durable too.  Ordering and delivery was quick and easy, as always, with Amazon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely an interesting plot with several twists/ turns to keep the reader on his/ her toes!! It was a good read, but it was also a little dark. I recommend this book for anyone who likes some cynic humor and maybe a bit of evil with their fiction. Again,there are definite dark moments, so it isn't the light hearted read that goes by quickly, leaving warm fuzzies in its wake. Still, it was well done and quite enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these are the best games ever.I love how its challenging but not to challenging.GET THIS GAME NOW!!!And I mean now!
0307592731|5.0|Anyone who has lost a mother to cancer is going to relate to this story, that gaping hole our mothers leave that many of us plummet down. Cheryl Strayed's book, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, resonated with me, from the shock, denial and eventual acceptance of my own mother's death.  And, though I sobbed through several scenes (the death of her mother's beloved horse), the book is far from morose, but rather humorous, cathartic, awakening, and confirming.<br /><br />Cheryl sets off on The Pacific Crest Trail, without proper preparations, or research, just an \\"ah-ha moment\\" that she might find herself after her mother's death causes her to spiral downward into drugs, infidelity, and divorce.<br /><br />She took this wilderness trail through the Mohave Desert, up through the Sierra Nevada, and Cascade mountain ranges, alone in 1991, when there wasn't GPS, cell phones, or easy access to communications.  She didn't physically prepare, even used used heroin the week before (weak moment) still, she set out!  She wasn't packed correctly; her \\"Monster\\" backpack literally dug holes into her hips.  Her feet were mutilated from boots that were too small, and eventually she loses those off a cliff.  But she never turns back, even though it was a record snowfall, forcing her to leave the trail in various locations and skirt the edges.<br /><br />There's so many delightfully funny moments of an ill prepared journey, some poignant, with interesting hikers and \\"trail angels\\" along the way, and you'll find yourself cheering her on.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you hike or not, the journey is just worth tagging along.  The grueling trail gives her insights and revelations about herself and eventually some peace about her mother's death, and self forgiveness.<br /><br />If I had to give any critical sighting, it would be that I'd wished the ending had a little more depth.  Still, the journey was wonderful and I loved every step she took--felt I was on that trail with her.il with her.

0060392886|5.0|I missed Motley Crue, due to my youth, so i read this not as a fan, but a fan of rock and hard music.  I LOVED this book.  It wasn't your usual, boring \\"i was born in...\\"book.  I liked how it was divided into different band members recollection of an event and how their recollection varied.  It also seemed very honest.  I learnt more about these four people than i ever have about any rock band.  It was so personal.  I shed some tears when Vince recollection of his daughters death. Excellent book.  I bought Girls, girls girls and Dr Feelgood halfway through reading this. They have a new fan :)  THANKS GUYS!!!  HIGHLY recommend!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is boring I think it is dumb and so so so so hard.it is a wast of time.so do not buy!!!&iexcl;!!!&iexcl;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A co-worker told me about Wool and, since it was only $5.95, I bought it and downloaded it to my iPad. I'm glad I did because this is a great book. The author does such an amazing job describing life in the silo that you feel as though you are there. And, really, that is the best part of the book...the descriptive language. The story then becomes a mystery. Who are these people? How did they end up in a silo? Are they the only people left in the world or are there others? The characters are well developed, the story catches you and won't let go, and you keep reading to find out what happens. In short, you will not be disappointed with this book. I downloaded Wool 6 and can't wait to start it. Congrats to the author on a fantastic book!

B008UZDXCO|5.0|Warning: Opening scene:<br /><br />The movie starts out funny. Steve Carrol and his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) are sitting at a restaurant. Steve asks his wife what she wants. She blurts out, \\" A divorce.\\" On the way home Steve jumps out of the car. When they get home, the babysitter asks, \\"What happened to you?\\" Steve very dryly says, \\"Emily said she wanted a divorce and I jumped out of the car.\\" Meanwhile Emily is discussing with the sitter about her child and broccoli. The sitter had walked in on the 13 year old boy while he was choking his chicken. He in turn tells the babysitter he was thinking of her. This beginning scene had me hooked...then Emma Stone comes on the screen as icing on the cake. 5 star opening scene. Oh and the 17 year old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) has taken a liking to Steve.<br /><br />Steve does not take the divorce very well. He goes to a bar and pours out his grief to anyone who will listen and sometimes he talks to the thin air. He is taken in under the tutoring of pick-up artist Ryan Gosling who guarantees to make this sad sack into a lady killer. Steve does very well until he opens his mouth. When he talks he makes women want to leave the bar....with Ryan Gosling. Eventually Steve becomes a master Jedi. Kevin Bacon plays David Lindhagen, the \\"other man.\\"<br /><br />The movie has many laugh out loud moments, great characters and great actors with a wonderful climax scene. From the title you should be able to figure out this is a chick flick.

B008UZEL34|3.0|A group of thugs from Charlestown, Boston, Mass. rob a bank. They take the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) along with them. They take her license and leave her by the ocean, only to find out she lives 4 blocks away. Ben Affleck, the brains of the group, stalks her to find out what she knows. He starts to date her and falls in love, or at least a Charlestown version of love, he buys her dinner, they have sex and he gets her a necklace. The relationship was not well developed due to the bad writing of Affleck who was more concerned about his scene shots than giving us a believable script. Ben and his boys rob more places. The FBI knows everyone in the gang who committed the crimes and start to close in to a final climatic scene.<br /><br />Not Affleck's best role. Never write, direct and star in the same movie. This movie was referenced by the GOP to describe their relationship to the Tea Party with Affleck being the GOP and the Tea Party being his psycho killer friend...and the Tea Party liked the analogy.(Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger.)<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: Sex, F-bombs, no nudity.
1451627289|5.0|I've been a long-time fan of King's work. My favorite book of all time had been The Stand. It's now been replaced (although I still adore The Stand) by this book. I did not want it to end, and my heart ached when it did.  If you're like me, and you've read King's works, you'll notice the references to older novels. I'm clear on fantasy vs. reality, but it almost felt like I knew Jake Epping and felt his joy as well as his pain--a testament to Mr. King's writing. 11-22-63 will stay with you long after you've put it down, and you'll remember every nuance, every pleasure, every pain for a long time to come.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|I saw this movie last month on Netflix. Before seeing it, I had seen GIFs of the movie on the internet (Tumblr) and thought it looked really interesting. I saw the movie on Netflix and I was hooked. It has now become one of my top 5 favorite movies. I love love love the soundtrack to it as well which was done by Alex Turner. I am now an Arctic Monkeys fan thanks to this movie. It was just a very relatable movie. I loved every second. I also found out Ben Stiller produced this....I had NO IDEA he produced movies let alone had this kind of ability. AMAZING!
B004ZNANZA|5.0|The disk 1 and 2 do not require comment, as it topped the charts in the United States, France, Germany, Sweden and Australia when it was released. \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2\\" became a hit, selling over a million copies in a few weeks after launch, now the demo CD is without doubt a wonderful news and he was alone worth the expense to the album, it brings a side of \\"the Wall\\" I did not know.

B00362DRMW|5.0|This release is a very good one! The sound quality is far better than the ordinary Vinyl album orignal release, plus very interesting new versions. If you collect Duran Duran, you probably have all the versions, and the 2CD + DVD Deluxe Edition is a better choice, but this is worth your money too.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|So you've probably heard one or two of Pink Floyd's big iconic albums, Dark Side of The Moon or The Wall perhaps, and you'd like to delve a little deeper. Where to begin? Well I recommend Meddle.<br /><br />Right from it's opening winds to it's ever ascending closing choir Meddle takes you on a \\"trip\\". A cliche I know but it seems little can be written about Pink Floyds music without referring the psychadelic experience. You don't have to be high though to appreciate or understand Pink Floyd, something about Meddle seems to resonate with the part of your mind that dreams, it's as though they've discovered some secret esoteric musical formula. Maybe that's why they become so many people's favourite band?<br /><br />Pink Floyd were always moving forward and with Meddle you could almost sense they were on the edge of something big. They'd brought along what they'd learnt from their experimental soundtrack years and were now combining it with a growing skill in arrangement and a knack for great, great tunes. Of course they really were on edge of something big but we didn't know that back then!<br /><br />There's almost nothing better than donning your headphones and floating away on a pillow of winds to Meddle land! It's beautifully mixed to create the Floyd landscape. Gilmour's guitar is almost impossibly mournful, Mason's organ sounds are deep and gutteral throughout and the harmonies are lush and tuneful. Much has been said about the dynamic within the band but on Meddle they must have been perfectly in balance. Things gets a bit weird in places but that's what we all love about Floyd right.<br /><br />Meddle is one of those albums you won't want to listen to in passing, it arrests your attention, it is a world within itself. This is where I come to another recommendation; if you're into that Floyd approach of expansive, slightly proggy, ambitious, guitar driven tunage then you should try Mohribold by Andrew Taylor (google it), I downloaded it from a site called bandcamp. Taylor creates landscapes with his music just like Pink Floyd used to and remember you heard it here first!

B003U21TBO|5.0|I love Matt Smith as the Doctor and I love Amy as the Doctor's companion. And this particular episode is outstanding. In fact, I found it more than a little touching. Easily earns 5 stars.<br /><br />I never really got Dr. Who until I saw a Matt Smith episode. Now I'm fully into the series. Smith is quite a good actor. His version of the Doctor is quirky, distracted, funny, brilliant, but more than anything else, compassionate. He has an ever-present kindness in his eyes that is very believable.

B005PYZG6E|1.0|Listen I was like you thinking that there are just a bunch of negative nancies on here. Nope this thing is not worth anything, that's right anything. Even if it was $1 it wouldn't be worth it. It can barely balance itself, I tried all of my cameras including the tiny GoPro. IT DOESN'T WORK. Spend the extra and I know it's a big difference, but this thing doesn't work. You are buying a paperweight. Seriously look at the product stock photo, the person is balancing it with their thumb... I wish I had read the other negative reviews...
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writing was terrible and childish, the story line was kind of crap and the characters were overly winey and moody with not much depth but still likable to a point. The books feels like it is written by a high school student with a kinky but immature mind. The repetition in the novel is awful. The same phrases such as \\"oh crap\\" and \\"groan\\" are overused to the point of murder and it feels like the author pulled out a thesaurus and just randomly replaced words to make the book seem more well written. It only made the novel more juvenile.<br /><br />Will I read the rest of the series? Probably, because I just can't stand not finding out for myself what happens.<br /><br />All in all if you're looking for a well written classic piece of literature, go read an Austen or a Bronte, but if you're looking for an easy, weekend read with a slightly erotic twist, give Fifty Shades of Grey a shot. It's not a bad book, but it's definately not going to leave your mind churning from its intellectual wit.
B007STBUIW|5.0|** This is a review of the BD/DVD 100th anniversary edition **<br /><br />I don't know where to start.<br /><br />The digital restoration is amazing, especially in regards to Bruce (the shark). The feature AND most of the extras are all in 7.1 sound. The BD is slammed full of special features covering everything from the musical score, extras, interviews, and all sorts of chum in the waters. There are more than two HOURS of bonus material, but alas: no commentary. Dollar for dollar, quote for quote, this is the version a true JAWS fan wants. Everything else is left wanting.<br /><br />The Shark Still Works, and it looks great!

030758836X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns of this book until the last chapter.  I hated the ending.  I don't want to go into details because I don't want to ruin the suspense.  However, unless the author is planning a sequel, the last chapter was totally scary; in not a good way, and it's too awful to imagine the possibilities.

1468161660|5.0|Lake tries to cope with the loss of her father as best as she can, but leaving Texas and the only home she'd ever known to move in a strange town seems too much to take. At least her younger brother, Kel, seems to be taking it well thanks to the little boy next door. Caulder is also 9 and the two of them become instantly best friends. Life seems much easier in childhood...<br />But there isn't only one boy next door. Will, the big brother, is a good looking man that draws Lake in from the first moment they meet. They have a perfect first date that makes their connection even stronger, and both realize they're meant to be together.<br />And then reality hits hard.<br /><br />I didn't see SLAMMED as the typical forbidden love story. Will is very young at 21 and Lake is 18 - even if she's been 18 only for two weeks. This makes them an appropriate young couple in my opinion. They enter each other's lives at exactly the right moment, filling the void they feel inside. Nevertheless, I don't think this book was really about what forces them apart, but more about what draws them together. The fact that their relationship is forbidden is nothing but another boulder that life throws in their way. Will they be able to get over it?<br /><br />  \\"God Layken. How do you do it?\\" she says. She blows her nose and grabs another tissue out of the box. How do I do what? I sniff as I continue to wipe the tears from my eyes. \\"How do you not fall in love with him?\\" The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they had ceased. I grab yet another tissue. \\"I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!\\"<br /><br />I usually avoid drama stories for the main reason that I see too much of them in real life. I try not to let them also invade the little time I spend reading. I consider reading the best way to escape reality - even for a little while - and that's why I read fantasy - mostly. That being said, it's not the tragedy they have to cope with, nor the fact thatlife seems to hit them from every direction, the reason that made me love this book so much. I think I loved it because Lake and Will are so young! And they keep enjoying life at any cost! They still live it, they still go out, have fun, make friends.<br /><br />  Life wants you to fight it<br />  Learn how to make it your own.<br />  It wants you to grab and axe and hack through the wood.<br />  It wants you to get a sledgehammer and break through concrete.<br />  It wants you to grab a torch and burn through the metal and steel until you can reach through and grab it.<br /><br />This novel is the perfect reminder that life goes on, with it's good and bad things - and it's still beautiful.  I didn't imagine so many bad things could happen to real people in such a short time, practically all at once - but I guess they could, and that's the most amazing thing about SLAMMED: it's so real, that you can actually feel the story, taste the sadness, the helplessness. This actually scared me a bit: the possibility that somewhere, someone can pass through such trauma, and it could be any of you, or even me.<br /><br />  \\"Don't take life too seriously. Punch it in the face when it needs a good hit. Laugh at it.\\"<br /><br />How can a book be so fast paced and at the same time leave you the impression that the action takes place at this very moment, that your best friend tells you in detail her story? Well that's how SLAMMED is. It left me questioning myself how much tragedy can a person endure, and what can keep one moving on. I loved all about it. The storyline, the analogies - how could someone stop carving pumpkins? - the two little brothers with their clever little games, and, most of all, the poetry.<br /><br />  \\"I got schooled this year<br />  by<br />  a<br />  boy.<br /><br />  A boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.<br />  And he taught me the most important thing of all...<br /><br />  To put the emphasis<br />  On life .\\"<br /><br /> Happy Reading!

B007STBUIW|3.0|If you want a GREAT movie,then you need look no further than JAWS. But if you want the original version as it appeared in the theaters back in 1975, you won't find it here. Even though this edition of JAWS is billed as being from the original 35mm print, it's not. This is still the same version that has been in previous DVD releases and VHS tape releases with the chopped up opening theme music, the chopped up opening credits. When JAWS appeared on TV for the first time, the opening titles and credits had to replaced with smaller versions that would fit the TV screens (they didn't do letterboxing back then). And since that time, JAWS has never been the same. They've always released this TV version. Will we ever see JAWS on DVD or BluRay as it originally appeared in 1975 in the theaters? I'm beginning to wonder of anybody has a copy of that version any more.

0451205146|5.0|I think most people have heard of Black Hawk Down, if not from the actual battle itself than from the much acclaimed movie.  The movie has been a long time favorite of mine and one that I watch periodically.  I finally gave in read Bowden's narrative of the events of that ever so violent battle.<br /><br />What makes Bowden's account so interesting is that not only does he tell the side of the Americans, but he also tells, although not in as much detail, the side of the Somalis.  This added so many more levels to the story that he made it more of an important event in history for both countries, instead of major battle for the Americans.  Bowden's narrative follows many accounts and is able to give such a detailed account of what happened because of how many eyewitnesses there were.  He was able to crosscheck their stories with someone else's and ultimately come of with a very real depiction of what happened.  What started as a quick snatch of high level people turned in to a blood bath as the Somalis were prepared, using the very weapons the Americans were confident could not harm them: RPGs.  As the first helicopter went down it set in motion chains of events that showed the horror that not only the Marines, SEALS and Delta Force had to live through, but what horror the Somalis people were enduring to stand for what they perceived as correct and right.<br /><br />The interesting difference between the movie and the book is that where certain characters were amplified and made larger than life in the movie.  Hoot, the Delta Force operator, fearless in battle and expert at what he did, was in actuality many Delta Force operators combined in to one.  Sergeant Eversman, a prominent character in the movie, actually played next to no part in the book.  Instead all the events that took place in the movie around him were a whole bunch of isolated incidents with other marines throughout the battle.  It is obvious that the book will always be better than a movie (well almost always), but in this case this is so true simply because it painted a much better picture of the men involved, showed their true sides and what they stood for.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend Black Hawk Down to not only those who have watched the movie, but also for anyone interested in military books.  This is one battle that is an absolute must to read to get the greater picture of what happened in Mogadishu, and to come to some beginning of an understanding of the political situation there in 1993.<br /><br />5 stars
B007V508CC|2.0|I tried really hard to like this album, but all of the magic is gone and this album is basically pop radio fodder.  I can hardly hear guitars at all!  Nothing but synth, droning and dumb 4/4 loud bass drum downbeat, and Levine singing (which gets annoying).  I hope this was a fluke.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I tend to read through a whole series when I like the author, the setting, and the main character. I picked up The Redbreast on a friend's recommendation and enjoyed it very much! Excellent plot line and character development! I will devour them all. Harry Hole is a memorable guy...right up there with Larsson's Blomkvist and DeMille's Corey.
B001B51B9M|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie made during my lifetime.  I know there have been a lot of movies that were more critically acclaimed, but I remember seeing this in the theater when it first came out, and at the ripe old age of 6, it really inspired me.  So while I know, I probably have a person bias because of it, I still feel this is a wonderful and wholesome movie.

0805095535|5.0|He is sixty-four.  The writer refers to himself as you, thereby inviting the reader in to share his musings.  He reports that he drinks and smokes, has vile habits.  In 1952 he is five.  In 2002 there is something wrong.  His wife worries about his driving.  Then the car is demolished.  The jaws of life are used to remove the author's wife from the car.  Childhood recalls a passion for baseball.  A game is something a boyish body is able to do.  In the seventies there is Paris.  In a dispute with a fellow tenant, the writer pointed out that it was absurd that two Jews were fighting each other.  The anger dissipated.<br /><br />The writer relates his childhood in Newark and the Oranges, his college years at Columbia, his sojourn in Paris, his writing career beginning with pieces in little magazines, and then his arrival in California, Berkeley rather than San Francisco for the lower rents.  Susequently he returned to New York, seeking its vastness, and ending up in Dutchess County carrying a broken marriage.  Next he lands on Varick Street at a time when he is able to start writing again and experiences shock and renewal.  Having to move in 1980, an apartment in Carroll Gardens is found.  From there the author and his family live at various addresses in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Summer of 1989 finds the family seeking respite from the city in Windham, Vermont.  Family members enjoy the silence and the Vermont air.  Panic ensues after the death of Auster's mother.  (This is certainly a reasonable reaction, I think.)  Moving to silence, the author concludes, he has entered the winter of life.  This is a wonderful book.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|EDIT3:  More than a year later, still going strong.  I'm still very happy with the watch and have had many people ask where to get one like it.<br /><br />EDIT2:  After a month with my replacement I feel comfortable updating my review again.  The replacement has a noisier rotor than the original, but at least it has stayed attached. :-)  I hear that it's kind of hit/miss on the rotor noise.  While this one is noisy, I've become accustomed to it and don't notice much anymore.  I like the watch overall and have increased my score back to 4 stars.<br /><br />EDIT:  Temporary edit, will update again later.  The winding rotor came unscrewed on mine after three weeks of otherwise perfect operation, so I'm returning it.  Have ordered another and will update my review once I have more experience.  Lowered from 5 to 3 stars...<br /><br />I'll start out with a disclaimer... I'm resisting my compulsion to collect far too much data.  For this reason, I have no data to report on the \\"to the second\\" accuracy of the watch.<br /><br />I received this watch a bit over two weeks ago.  My initial impressions were extremely positive.  It looks better than I expected, was the perfect size for my small wrists, and generally had a great feeling of quality.  It arrived very nicely packaged in a clam-shell box with a slip off sleeve holding it closed.  Inside I found a soft pillow with the Seiko logo on it holding the watch, an instruction booklet, and warranty information.  Very nice, I was afraid, based on some other reviews, that the watch would come in a zip-lock bag or something. :-)<br /><br />Visual inspection of the watch shows a very high quality fit & finish.  There was one very very tiny spot on the crystal (front glass) which was probably from manufacture, but you have to look very closely to see it.  The brushed finish of the case looks very nicely finished and shows no imperfections.<br /><br />I set the watch and put it on (be careful not to set the date during the hours around midnight, or you'll break it!!) and it fits well.  For a few days I found the band to be very uncomfortable, with sharp edges, but that went away rather quickly.  By day 3 or 4 I no longer noticed.<br /><br />I've worn the watch every day since I purchased it, taking it off at night and putting it on the bedside table.  It has plenty of reserve and continues to run through the night.  It has kept time within a minute (though I did change time zones twice, so it's been reset once per week) during the entire duration that I've owned it.  Mine came with the 7S26B movement, which apparently can have a problem with the hairspring hanging up if banged, causing the watch to run fast, but I've not experienced any such problem<br /><br />The case and crystal durability have been fine so far.  Admittedly I've been careful with it, but I have scraped it against door-jams and otherwise a few times by accident, yet it shows no sign of cosmetic damage from those mishaps, so I hope it will continue to be scratch free for some time.<br /><br />A few negatives:  1) the lume isn't quite as bright as I'd hoped.  It's EXTREMELY bright right after exposure to sunlight, but indoor lighting barely charges it enough and it only lasts a few hours after a typical evening indoors.  If you'll need the lume, be sure to  explicitly charge it with a flashlight or lamp or something.  2) the rotor (winding weight) does rattle a little bit (as some reviewers have noted), but I have to try to cause it and listen carefully to hear it.  It's mostly noticeable when I'm carrying the watch and not wearing it.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this watch so far and would recommend it to anybody who is interested in a value priced mechanical.

B005FI6IRG|5.0|In the language of wine, Cencic is \\"charnu\\" and Jaroussky is \\"bois&eacute;\\". Wine is \\"bois&eacute;\\" when the new wood of the barrel in which it has aged gives its taste to the wine and I would say the wood used for Jaroussky's vocal barrel was redwood or even maybe sequoia because it erupts into the sky like a spear of life out of some dark underground lair in the earth. Light, very slender and agile it climbs to heavens in one leap. On the other side wine is \\"charnu\\" when its body has some density and some fleshy elasticity. The dense vocal flesh of Cencic is like the embodiment of the light slim bones of Jaroussky. They are the two inseparable parts of the same being, the body and the skeleton without which there is no soul and the soul is the music. The best wines are those thar are \\"charnu\\" with a good \\"bois&eacute;\\" taste behind and throughout.<br /><br />If we listen to them like that, and no one can ever mix them up even when they sing together, we can see the music they sing live under our own eyes. One illuminates the other though Cencic is dark and yet brilliant with the light of the sun reflected into him by Jaroussky who is the selenian moon in the sky that reflects the light of the sun into Cencic and who takes its splendour from this darkness that you feel in Cencic and surrounds Jaroussky. Cencic is the roots of the tree of life and Jaroussky the fronds of that very same tree of life. And the tree of life is their music.<br /><br />We can only approach those two countertenors via metaphors because the simple music lovers who do not like technical words have not yet found the plain words and language with which we may be allowed to speak of these two admirable and adorable singers who are just enjoying their mystery and who don't want us to mix and meddle with their shared feelings and emotions. So we, the simple music lovers, are supposed to provide the dress and attire of this evanescent form we can hardly perceive through the images it brings to our minds and the empathy that Jaroussky and Cencic are sharing something that go miles and aeons beyond whatever we can imagine.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the victorious warrior Achilles who is able to hold the whole world mesmerized in front of his decision to suspend his support and let us die bloodless just because we do not deserve the privilege of winning the war against ugliness and inhumanity. Too bad for us but luckily there is Patroclus. Achilles gets his strength and will find his right mind in the love that unites him to Patroclus. Achilles is the whimsical inspiration of the moment who follows his guts and emotions whereas Patroclus has a sound sense of responsibility that comes from the unfathomable depth of history. And Patroclus sends Achilles back to the battle field, back to the music. And Achilles wins but launches Patroclus with him to the victory line. The Trojan Hors of these two is the music they share that invades our ears and ours souls. We are defeated like puppies in the claws of two eagles.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the batter on his home plate and Cencic is all the others, and first of all the pitcher, around this god, this king, this mysterious priest of an enigmatic religion, that of baseball. But the batter is nothing without his home plate on which he stands, and all the others are nothing without this home plate they have to reach and touch, and the batter in return is nothing since the value of the homes plate on which he stands comes from the need for the other, all the Cencics of the game to reach out and touch that home plate. How can you cut Jaroussky from Cencic without sterilizing the whole world of each one of them and of both, the whole world of us all. Music is a collective game and the batter is little without the pitcher who throws the ball and the players who have plenty of things to do to score and the audience who is suspended to the outcome.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the nibbana the illuminated spirituality worshipper is trying to reach so than when he dies he will finally be able to escape the curse of being reborn again, but Cencic is the eightfold path the illuminated spirituality worshipper has to follow to reach that nibbana. There is no escape from the curse of life if we don't have that path of enlightenment and illumination. There is no beauty if Jaroussky and Cencic do not sing together and bring us the nibbana of perfect passion and passionate perfection.<br /><br />But more than anything else Jaroussky is David and Cenci is Jonathan, the son of King Saul who hates David and wants Jonathan his son to kill him. But it all goes wrong because David without Jonathan's love is dead to the future he carries in himself, and Jonathan without David's love is dead for God and salvation since he would become a plain and ordinary murderer executing his father's orders and everyone would hate? He prefers obeying Saul's folly who sends him to fight some Philistines, though he Jonathan knows he will die in that battle, but then he would not have to kill David and be rejected by God and David will eternally love him beyond his own death. That love between Jonathan and Davis is so well rendered by Handel in his opera Saul. And the story comes from far away:<br /><br />\\"17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.<br />58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.<br />18:1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.<br />2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.<br />3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.<br />4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\\" (1 Samuel 17:57-18:4, Bible, American Standard Version)<br /><br />To finish with that CD, I have to speak of tracks 22 and 23. In both Jaroussky and Cencic are two young men who are in love with the same woman. Instead of fighting to the death or one treacherously killing the other, or the other committing suicide out of despair, they come together and cannot find any way out of their curse. Since they love the same woman the same way they are forever linked and bound together in a love that is beyond the way they love the woman they love, the love of two souls tied up together in some kind of a fix.<br /><br />\\"That noble light / leads my soul / enthralled and bound.<br />Following those footsteps / my loyalty could never / live more contented / or more happily.\\" (track 22)<br /><br />Their contentment is in the common love they share and in the common resolution to walk together away from this woman since they are bound together and cannot cut themselves from each other but neither one nor the other will ever forget that woman and the love they feel for her.<br /><br />And again:<br /><br />\\"Say, god of hearts / if there is any pain equal to mine.\\" (track 23)<br /><br />Imagine these two excerpts sung by the two men together in absolute love for that same woman and you may understand the blending of the two voices, both obviously male in their harmonics, and one always on top of the other and yet we never know which one is on top and the other under, and yet you will never mix them. They are so different in their sameness and so identical in their specificity.<br /><br />That's when you understand that it is a crime against artistic humanity to have female sopranos replace castratos... or countertenors and male sopranos in today's world. It is true some of the best conductors do it. Well at least one does not and it is William Christie.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUn when he dies he will finally be able to escape the curse of being reborn again, but Cencic is the eightfold path the illuminated spirituality worshipper has to follow to reach that nibbana.

And the story comes from far away:<br /><br />\\"17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.<br />58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.<br />18:1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.<br />2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.<br />3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.<br />4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel,even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\\" (1 Samuel 17:57-18:4, Bible, American Standard Version)<br /><br />To finish with that CD, I have to speak of tracks 22 and 23. In both Jaroussky and Cencic are two young men who are in love with the same woman. Instead of fighting to the death or one treacherously killing the other, or the other committing suicide out of despair, they come together and cannot find any way out of their curse. Since they love the same woman the same way they are forever linked and bound together in a love that is beyond the way they love the woman they love, the love of two souls tied up together in some kind of a fix.<br /><br />\\"That noble light / leads my soul / enthralled and bound.<br />Following those footsteps / my loyalty could never / live more contented / or more happily.\\" (track 22)<br /><br />Their contentment is in the common love they share and in the common resolution to walk together away from this woman since they are bound together and cannot cut themselves from each other but neither one nor the other will ever forget that woman and the love they feel for her.<br /><br />And again:<br /><br />\\"Say, god of hearts / if there is any pain equal to mine.\\" (track 23)<br /><br />Imagine these two excerpts sung by the two men together in absolute love for that same woman and you may understand the blending of the two voices, both obviously male in their harmonics, and one always on top of the other and yet we never know which one is on top and the other under, and yet you will never mix them. They are so different in their sameness and so identical in their specificity.<br /><br />That's when you understand that it is a crime against artistic humanity to have female sopranos replace castratos... or countertenors and male sopranos in today's world. It is true some of the best conductors do it. Well at least one does not and it is William Christie.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm being selective in the books that I am downloading to my Kindle....took the advice from my neighbor who reads constantly. She is 30 and I am 60...this is a good read for all. Unbelievable twists and turns..Good book!
0380977273|5.0|Revisiting novels I loved in my youth. Purchased \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" Ray Bradbury after his recent passing last month. -Wasn't available in Kindle and so I purchased a hardcopy- haven't done that in over a year. Got it yesterday afternoon and finished half before I realized it.<br /><br />Such rich characters such as Tom Fury, lightening-rod salesman who tells the main characters that there is a storm coming the night a dark carnival comes to town. Will Halloway and his best friend Jim Nightshade, both 13 years old and born next door neighbors. They have the distinction of being born one minute apart at the stroke of midnight. Bradbury has them see the exact same events, but their point of view is so widely different. Blond Will is the optimist and Jim Nightshade ever the pessimist. Will's dad, Charles Halloway is the older-frail librarian who stands against Mr. Dark, the illustrated man and owner of the carnival- think surrogate father- who wants to lure Jim away as his new partner. I have to think that Stephen King has this book on his own shelf- themes are similar in so many of his own titles.<br /><br />Yup, I'm a fan and have been since I was Will Halloway's age- I cannot recommend this as a Young Adult title however. I am not sure if the themes adults willing to sacrifice their souls for youth or teenagers willing to sacrifice their youth for adulthood isn't too subtle.

I hope the BDSM community is pissed off about this horrid book that should have stayed as \\"fan fiction\\". I couldn't even finish the book, its like the author couldn't decide what direction she wanted to take the story. Also, I am no literary genius, but if this book was edited at all the editor should be fired & never allowed to edit again. Waste of time!! I have better sex than what is in this book. If the average woman gets all excited about the sex in this book they need to educate their man on what they want. Its called open communication.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ok...so this is not literary genius. But seriously, did anyone really expect it to be? I certainly did not. I read it because a friend recommended it and I had heard all the hype. Honestly, the sex was not my favorite part of the series. The story was. I could, on some levels, relate to Ana and Christian. What girl has not dreamed of some rich, good-looking hottie to sweep her off of her feet? I usually do not read to have realistic scenarios. I read to ESCAPE the realistic scenarios! So, if you're looking to escape for a while into an easy-to-read, fun-filled fantasy, read this series. It's worth it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'd always wondered when TV would get around to putting on a show about zombies. Heck, we have or had TV shows on everything from vampires(True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, Moonlight) to werewolves(Teen Wolf) to aliens invading earth(V, Fallen Skies).<br /><br />The Walking Dead being the biggest hit of the 2010 television season might not be too far off, to be honest.<br /><br />Based on the acclaimed graphic novel by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead follows police officer Rick Grimes who wakes up from a coma after being shot to find that the world he once knew no longer exists. In its' place, a zombie epidemic of worldly proportions. His wife and son are missing so he hits the road to look for them. Heading to Atlanta where, literally, all the survivors are heading; Rick finds a small group of people who struggle to survive as zombies face them at each and every turn.  That, my friends, is where the saga of The Walking Dead begins.<br /><br />If you're thinking that this show is like all the zombie movies you've ever watched, well- it isn't. What makes this show shine is how it deals with the humanity of this global epidemic. An example of this is how Rick, in one scene, goes back to put the Bicycle zombie woman out of her misery and apologizes to her that what happend to her happend & that he has to do what he has to do to end her suffering. Some reviewers out there seem to think that the show blows it out of proportion and make a big deal out of the emotional things. Personally, I think that is what sets this apart from all the other zombie stories out there. It gives a more realistic approach to dealing with a situation like that. I mean, ask yourself this..Would you not feel remorse for having to put someone out of their misery of being turned into something such as that?<br /><br />Make no mistake; there's plenty of blood, guts & everything else that makes zombie films so great..as well. It is a zombie program after all. So, for those of you that are in it for that, the show has that too.<br /><br />I suggest this show to all fans of the genre and even those who aren't. It's a really great program.that, the show has that too.<br /><br />I suggest this show to all fans of the genre and even those who aren't. It's a really great program.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|Loved it! Needed to be longer though for more plot development...hopefully this extended version will provide exactly that. I am definitely hoping for a sequel!
034580404X|2.0|This series wants so much to be like Twilight, Hunger Games and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but falls short.  The writing is formulatic - conflict, sex, happy times, repeat.  But this series uses the same formula over and over and over.  The sex is childish, Anna never really grows as a person, Christian is the only interesting character and the story is predictable.  The sub-plots are unbelievable (i.e. Elliot and Kate).  This series had so much promise and with a good editor it could have been another great series, but there are just too many short comings.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|This was a moving and well written book that made me feel like I was walking beside the author and helping her discover what had happened. I love reading any books that take place overseas (especially France), so loved this book even more.<br /><br />The main topic of this book (the fate of many Jewish citizens in France) is such an important part of history and this book made it easy to relate and follow, giving many people who have not directly been touched by this or previously taught in depth about it (such as myself) a better understanding of how devastating it really was.<br /><br />I liked that the main character, Julia, was a strong woman, and not afraid to make hard decisions based on what is truly right, both personally and professionally - even though this is a fictional story I think more young woman need strong role models to look up to (rather than weak female characters like in Fifty Shades!)<br /><br />I've only just realised they have made this book in to a movie, so this is one I will be checking out soon for sure. A great book and one I think  most readers would be able to pick up and enjoy.
0345803507|2.0|Of the three books, this is worst.  It's so formulatic - conflict, sex, happy times, repeat - and predictable.  You know where this story is going and the sub-plots are not believeable (i.e. Elliot and Kate). I knew how it was going to end, but I was invested in the characters enough to want to read this book.  If you have read the first two then you'll want to finish the series, but don't get your hopes up.
0553386794|3.0|I'd heard some great things about Game of Thrones and ASOIAF in general, so I picked this up a while back and now I'm going to start reviewing the series (I'm on book 4 currently).<br /><br />As for this book amongst the series as a whole:<br /><br />Of the first three books, this one is the weakest.  That said, the next two books are among the best I've ever read, so calling this one the weakest is still saying something.  This book is also much more plot driven than the others, which are guided more by the characters personal desires than an outside force.  The characters don't feel as developed, as such, but even still they're quite gripping.<br /><br />As for the book by itself:<br /><br />Exhilarating.  The political intrigue, the characters, the powerful sense of gray.  This is more of a cynic's fantasy novel than anything, I believe.  It lacks the traditionalism and the sense of epicness (in literary terms, not in atmosphere) that older fantasy authors borrowed from the ancient classics.  There's a good sense of pace, balancing the quick parts with the slow parts.  Unlike so many other fantasy novels out there this book lacks any painfully dull scenes.  When its slow, it's slow for a good reason--to build character, mostly.<br /><br />The most powerful aspect of this book is how it treats its characters.  There's a stark sense of reality, here.  Anyone can die, just like in real life, and anyone can be hurt, and hurt terribly, at that.  This is not a friendly world.  There is no sense of contrived hope and happiness, and that can often lead to crushing defeats, in both a physical and emotional sense.  I've often heard that as a complaint, but think of this--the harder the character's fall, the more incredible you'll feel when they rise to meet the challenge and finally overcome it.  They need to hit rock bottom, otherwise the series ends, or the conflicts are resolved simply and quickly and you don't feel much.  Relish those dark moments.  Be thankful that Martin can make you feel something so potent, and know that it will all pay off in a way you probably won't expect.rtin can make you feel something so potent, and know that it will all pay off in a way you probably won't expect.
0345803493|3.0|This book is the best of the Fifty Shades series.  It focuses more on Christian's past.  The book suffers from lack of editing and the sex is juvenile and boring like the first book.  Again the author continues to use the same phrases over and over, which is where a good editor would help.  But if you made through the first book this book is much more interesting.
0553582038|1.0|So, I've read the other three books.  I'd say the first is three stars, the second and third are five stars, and this... a measly one star.  This book is downright boring.  And, unlike what most people say, it's not entirely because of this somewhat-new cast we're introduced to, here.  Granted, part of that is the reason, but not all of it.  The problem is the general lack of conflict.  I found that most chapters just have characters performing mundane actions--their daily activities.  Not everything has to be a great sword battle to garner interest, and Martin knows that.  Heck, there's little real action in the first three books, but all the slow parts are filled with juicy character development, conflict that comes from new experience and learning.  In this book there are no real challenges--the characters don't really end up learning anything.  They just have their little goals and go about completing them.  That's not compelling!<br /><br />Then there's the new cast.  Now, in some cases the \\"new cast\\" isn't all that new.  We're just getting new viewpoints from people who've been in the story already, like Cersei and Brienne.  Jaime returns, as do Arya and Sansa (who later goes by the name Alayne), and Samwell.  However, we get these little in between chapters, where we go to a new character viewpoint, usually from the Iron Islands or Dorn.  These in between chapters are just one-shots, each one from a new character.  This is a pain, as we often don't know these characters no do we care for them.  It's especially tricky to work a technique like this so far into the series, and it really doesn't pan out very well.  I skipped almost all of them.<br /><br />In fact, I found myself skimming through most of the book, which makes me wonder--why did this have to be its own book?  Those who follow Martin know that Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons, the fifth book, started out as one manuscript.  However, Martin felt it was growing too large, so he separated the books based on location and characters, and thus we have Feast for Crows.  But there's almost no true content in Feast.  It could have easily been closer to 300-350 pages and still told the same story, and it could have been incorporated into Dance with Dragons.  Granted, Dance with Dragons would then be enormous, but if its full of great story-telling, then who cares?  Better a titanic, great book then a crappy, padded kinda-long book.<br /><br />Really, there isn't much else to say, here.  I feel like the characters could have been incredibly interesting if Martin had used them well, but they just end up being mundane and tiresome.  Even viewpoint characters from the first three books like Arya and Jaime are severely lacking, here.  I hope Dance With Dragons doesn't disappoint like this one did.
0425263908|1.0|I found this book mundane. No real thought behind the characters and unrealistic. Have to admit I didn't finish the book to bored.
159514188X|5.0|I decided to write this review because I saw so many negative comments about the book, so I thought I should put my two cents in.  First of all, this book is really well written and the concept it remarkable.  I have never read a book before that was written like this and found it very engaging!  Second of all, a lot of the people have said that the main character Hannah is shallow and her reasons for suicide are selfish.  As true as this may be, they are missing the point of the book.  Suicide is a VERY serious subject and is one that is not discussed openly enough in high schools across this nation.  This book is a GREAT way to get the conversation started, and maybe someone that may feel as Hannah did will reach out for help.  For that reason alone, this book deserves 5 stars!  If you have teenagers in your family, this book should be read, not only by them, but by the parents as well.
0345803485|5.0|This is a hot, passionate ROMANCE with several intesnse, erotic love scenes.  This is NOT an Erotica Book, in the same way that Anne Rice's books are erotica.  This is heavy on the passion and romance.  These people actually fall in love.  As far as the quality of the writing, I look forward to see how Ms. James continues to grow in her craft.  She's a great story teller.  I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

1476712042|4.0|An aptly written title, I'm not exactly sure what to think of this one. I clearly liked it a whole lot, as I couldn't put it down and read it in just one night; I needed to know what happened. There were moments where I loved Abby and Travis, but there were also so many manic moments that made me hate them as a couple. As Abby's roommate says at one point in the book, Travis is too dependent on Abby and it's a disaster waiting to happen. She's right. It's not healthy, or cute, or the kind of relationship that I get to the end of the book and wish for.<br /><br />I think the part that disturbed me the most is the trivialization of fighting in this book. There were never any repercussions of Travis beating a kid to a pulp in the middle of the cafeteria, and nowadays when we see some terrible story every moment in the news, it's not OK. Yet the book made it seem OK and that he was untouchable. His rage was oftentimes so great that I kept thinking, \\"This is it, he's going to kill this guy and this book is just going to take one more step towards crazy.\\" It didn't. And, while I'm sure this happens in real life, it'll never be an action or an aspect of a relationship that I'll understand or idolize.<br /><br />The slightly crazy part is that despite it all, I lost myself in this book and the characters' stories. I somehow was rooting for them to figure it all out by the end, to make that big literary 180 that can only happen in books and make everything wrapped up in a nice bow. Of course it wasn't staying true to the characters to wrap it up so nicely, so I commend Ms. McGuire for not doing that. Because somehow, despite all my grievances and moments of head shaking and eye-rolling through the pages, there was just something about it that pulled me in. I was hooked, and, though I don't understand it, I'm intrigued to read the follow-up when it comes out.

B00005JPKE|5.0|This is a great movie. Iwo Jima was one of the bloodiest battles ever fought by U.S. forces. This movie shows the battle from the Japanese side. It shows the deprivations & suffering the soldiers suffered way before the invasion. It also takes us through the battle as the Japanese fought & died. Two parts of it struk me. The scenes were a wounded US Marine is brought into the cave network & is given what little medical care the Japanese had. There a Japanese officer talks with him about life in the states & the marine talks with him about his family & vice versa. Eventually the marine dies of his wounds. The other scene is where a couple of Japanese soldiers try to get to the marine lines to surrender. One makes it. Only to be executed a while after surrendering because the men guarding them were tired of their task & wanted to move on. So the prisoner was killed. A fantastic movie. I also have So sad to fall in battle, the book used as a starter for the movie. I highly recommend this. It's great!

B00BLSAM3A|5.0|Addendum to my review of the inferior 2007 blu-ray (Max against blue and orange clouds on the cover). This review is for the superior 2013 remastered blu-ray (Max against grayish clouds on the cover):<br /><br />Warner gets it right this time! The color saturation in this Australian \\"Mad Max 2\\" print is still a bit dull compared to the richer color of the American \\"Road Warrior\\" print Warner used to make the old 1996 DVD, which I think, minus the resolution of blu-ray, is still a perfectly fine transfer, but the color timing is thankfully toward the warm end of that old transfer and away from the cold blueish tint of the inferior 2007 blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />I reckon this is as good as this film is going to look on blu-ray. Dean Semler's \\"magic hour\\" (before dawn and after dusk) cinematography is once again a pleasure to look at, and the night scene when the Feral kid makes wolf calls to distract the baddies from killing Max is once again DARK, as it should be, not as dark as I remember it being in cinemas, but still pretty dark!<br /><br />Best of all, the 5.1 surround mix containing the omnipotent 360-degree surround effects has been reinstated.  Superb!<br /><br />Avoid the 2007 blu-ray like the plague. It is a sub-par transfer. Read my comments below:<br /><br />+++++<br /><br />While I love this film, I am not happy with the blu-ray of this action masterpiece. While the Aussie \\"Mad Max 2\\" print has plenty of detail, it lacks the rich, saturated color and contrast of the print used for the earlier \\"Road Warrior\\" American print used for the DVD. It looks like a work-print rather than a first-generation print made right off the original camera negative, which is what Warner should be using.<br /><br />There appears to be a limited exposure lattitude/contrast range between highlights and shadows in this print. The blue Aussie skies look mostly white, and the night scene when Max accidentally falls into a crevase and drops the gas cans he's been carrying alerting the Lord Humongous' dogs of war, and the Feral kid distracts one of the nasties by making wolf calls, looks unnecessarily brightened up to the point where there is horrendous grain visible swimming around and the left side of the screen is faded blue.  Horrible!<br /><br />To top it off, the soundtrack, while discreet stereo and very clean, seems to have lost its omnipotent 360-degree surround effects that are present in the 1997 Warner DVD. This is especially evident in the shot just preceding coming out of the blower in the beginning, when we are propelled head-over-heals from the past mono prologue back-story into stereo surround present, what would be a spectacular effect!  Gyro's helicopter coming in from the surrounds and in various fly-bys is also gone.<br /><br />Hopefully, Warner will put out some mondo edition of this release in the future, which will, hopefully, include both this Aussie \\"Mad Max 2\\" version AND the American \\"Road Warrior\\" version, with all the special features of this release plus some new ones, and, hopefully, the American Road Warrior version will be from a better print, as this Australian print is inferior.<br /><br />Creatively, the only differences between the \\"Mad Max 2\\" and \\"Road Warrior\\" versions of this film are:<br /><br />1) The opening zoomed-in title in the Aussie version says \\"Mad Max 2\\" and the design of the title looks cheesy like the original \\"Mad Max\\" title.  The superior zoomed-in \\"Road Warrior\\" title is in chrome with a flare across it.<br /><br />There are two more moments of \\"ultra-violence\\":<br /><br />2) There are two additional shots of Wez, Humungus' lead \\"dog of war\\", pulling the steel crossbow arrow out of his arm, a shot of the arrow tugging at his severed flesh and a shot of his face reacting to the pain, which the American MPAA apparently thought were too gory and painful, so they had director George Miller excise them from the American \\"Road Warrior\\" print.<br /><br />3) A closeup shot of the boomerang that the Feral kid threw in Wez's boy-toy's head, another shot the American MPAA also apparently thought was too gory.<br /><br />Otherwise, the \\"Mad Max 2\\" and \\"Road Warrior\\" versions of the film are identical, and I'm perfectly happy with the American \\"Road Warrior\\" print.  Looks like I'll be holding onto my old Warner DVD, as minus the resolution of high-def, I find it to be a better presentation of the film!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|the first two were awesome and i give them 5stars but i only give mocking jay 3 stars. it was rather boring and all that ever happened was katniss being in the hospital or hiding in a closet. i still recomend that you read the series the rest of it is great
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I am pleased with the Dark Shadows movie. Tim Burton did a fantastic job because it was entertaining, mysterious, and silly from start to finish. There wasn't a boring moment as the movie moved from one intriguing and highly dramatic scene to the next. Most notable are the special effects and make-up. Furthermore, all of the characters were interesting and very well acted. What keeps this movie intriguing is that it contains several sub-plots enmeshed into the main plot.<br /><br />Johnny Depp played his character exceptionally well with the utmost professional skill. The hilarious one-liners were delivered with perfection. Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, and Helena Bonham Carter performed with hilarious wit, too. The musical shock-rock legend Alice Cooper made a fantastic cameo and performance. Additionally, a cameo by horror legend Christopher Lee was a much appreciated surprise.<br /><br />The horror and silliness elements of the movie worked very well together in creating a great campy retrogressive fusion.<br /><br />This movie is recommended to those who are fans of Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Alice Cooper, and campy horror movies.<br /><br />I give this movie an A-.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could rate this amazing movie anywhere below 4 stars?! ''Rise of the planet of the Apes'' truly deserves to be in ''Planet of the apes'' saga. The movie started off as nothing special. The plot was not too original and certainly simple. Then through out half of the movie (before the point of no return happens with Cesar), we see us, humans, from our sadistic, barbarian side. You will see animal cruelty often. But then the expected happens and movie becomes truly magnificent as Cesar rises. I'm very much against animal abuse, and to those people who think they shouldn't watch because of it, you should! There is no overdose, and everything as if was taken from our every day lives. Besides of the virus that was designed by humans that turned apes into smart beings, everything else is very believable. Don't just take my word for it, buy the movie and enjoy it! I truly want a second part of the movie! And hope there are more like me. A great movie. Go and buy it right now! You won't regret your choice even if you are new to the ''Planet of the apes'' saga! I hope you will like it as much as I did!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|In the final book of the Hunger Games trilogy the fate of Katniss and the rest of the districts is finally revealed.  Collins begins the book giving a description of the secret, underground District 13 where Katniss and the survivors of District 12 are starting new lives.  Katniss is quickly thrust into her role as figurehead Mockingjay and, unfortunately, the hands on role she played in the arena is given up for one where she smiles for the cameras, gives some speeches, and is on constant watch so she can't get her hands dirty.  While Katniss is tyring to come to terms with her future in District 13 Peeta is being tortured by President Snow, eventually becoming the voice of the Capitol and Katniss's most dangerous enemy.<br /><br />As a stand alone book Mockingjay doesn't deliver the way the other two books in this trilogy have.  There is a lot of action but somehow this doesn't help the plot along.  Of the three books this is the one that drags the most.  Katniss is out of her element in the role of figurehead and, while she is still the girl on fire we've come to love, the rest of her team is less than lovable.  It's hard to love former head-game maker Plutrarch and the residents of District 13 come across as unfeeling compared to the citizens of 12.  That being said this book does still deliver some lovable characters with Finnick and Anne, and even Johanna.<br /><br />This book seems to be a lot more graphic than the other two, although nothing more intense than the things Collins has already described in the arena.  The love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta is milked for all it's worth and, while it makes for an interesting side story, really takes up too much of the plot.  All this aside, the ending will deliver a few twists that make this book's shortcomings worth forging through and delivers a satisfying ending to the trilogy. Collins does add an epilogue for those dying to know what happens to Katniss once the war is over, but as I'm not a fan of epilogues I don't think it adds much to the story and could have been done without.  Then again, there are plenty of readers who will enjoy it.<br /><br />As an ending to the trilogy this book is a success, but on its own it doesn't stand up to the original \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  It does seem to drag in the middle and a lot of the action is just more of the same.  Once you've gotten into the Hunger Games it would be impossible to quit so there's no reason to pass up on the final book of the series, just don't be surprised if you find yourself a little disappointed with what you're given.epilogues I don't think it adds much to the story and could have been done without.

B005I6EU7U|2.0|I bought this because it was rich looking and created the illusion of my kindle being a real book. I bought this in Feb of 2012. About 2 months ago the bottom left strap broke. One side came out of the slit that it was glued in. I was not happy but it still functioned. Then last night the bottom right strap broke the same way. Now I am sure I can probably re-glue the straps with much difficulty and have it functioning again but I am not about to go through the hassle. This should have never happened. The price is high and I thought worth it for the look and feel (not real leather but...). Now I have to purchase another case but will stay away from ones that hold the Fire with straps! I am giving it 2 stars as I did really like it at first but am not happy with the strap problem.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|i love this app. ive had it for years. use it every night. the reason i took a star away is because in order to shut it off- u have to shut down my kindle. that's annoying. ive tried task managers but it doesn't shut it down. everything else Does,  but not white noise. Fix it!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Alot of people will throw this show down before they even watch it because of the fact that it looks something similar to \\"Twilight\\". Well let me be the first to tell you that this show is in no way shape or form related to those films. This show is amazing, I was suprised when I saw the first episode because I knew it was hooked! I have always been a MASSIVE SMALLVILLE (Tom Welling, Kristin Kruek) fan and was dissapointed when it ended because I didn't think there would be a show with a similar plot to come around, Vampire Diaries is a chick drama and romance type show, Supernatural never caught my attention...though to be honest I have never given it a solid chance. But seriously watch this show, there was an interview with the producer (if you go to the Wiki Page of the show)and he states that they are planning to run this show for a lot more seasons. Even after the \\"High School Era\\" the characters are currently in. Thats good news for us who are hooked. The acting, lighting, directing, and all the rest of the making of this show is extremely good. Give it a shot, if after the 5th or 6th episode you don't like it...so be it. This to me would fall under the Genre of Dark Comedy/Supernatural Drama.<br /><br />Cheers Mate!<br /><br />Do Not let the Cover scare you away. lol

B0083GNOYW|5.0|Great season finale, The show has been going on for a while now and is much closer to the series finale than the series pilot, But I love the direction the show is going, I hope Ted's wife is introduced with at least 3 episodes left, so we can get a chance to know who's been making us scratch our heads for the past 7-8 years lol, Most characters are very likable, (I'm personally not a big fan of Robin or Lily) But they're a big part of the show and it wouldn't be the same without them.
B005K15XR4|5.0|I have been collecting Scores and Soundtrack music since the late 1970s. This was before you could buy them, when I had to sneak my cassette recorder into the movie to capture these sounds. We're now in the Age of Hans Zimmer and this genre of music has been shoved into the next level. Two Steps From Hell IS the next level. Though their focus is Trailer music, they have a style of composing that has brought an epicness that has never been seen before. \\"Invincible\\" features a very good mix of their most powerful pieces, and is a very good display of their explosive style. This is what Chuck Norris listens to when he exercises (probably).
B00631VJIC|4.0|The cd is very good , one or two songs just ok. But there are many more songs that should have been included. We can only hope they will be on another cd. If a second cd was available I would be first in line to buy it.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Due to the hype given this book I felt there must be something to back it up.  Unfortunately, after the first couple of titilating chapters, the book is a repeat of the same. Definitely a book for the young looking to expand their \\"knowledge\\" but as for a story line goes the book is weak.  No wonder the whole set of the \\"Grey\\" stories is currently being sold at knock down prices already.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Calling a movie a classic a bold statement. When one thinks of the word classic, other films, oscar winning films, will probably come to mind.<br /><br />Hocus Pocus is a staple of the Halloween and autumn season, just like Autumn leaves, The Spirit Store, Pumpkin Pie and Cheesecake, Jack-O-Laterns, Tim Burton, lowering temperatures, crisp cool nights and the colors black and orange are. 20 years later, it still is, more than ever. That, simply, is why this movie is a classic.

B0083EXW50|4.0|This is a fine follow up to the awesome \\"Mechanize\\" album.  Many of the songs sound similar to songs off of that album.  However, \\"Mechanize\\" is a much better album.  I bought the 10 track version of this album and the last two tracks are disappointing.  They make up a long, repetitive, and rather pointless ambient industrial track that just doesn't fit well with the rest of the album.  Hearing it once was enough for me so whenever I got to those tracks I skipped them upon repeated listening of the album.
B00338QENI|5.0|One of the few times the ENTIRE book club loved a selection!

Great read for people who love a great story, as well as social reformists and scientific-minded types.

B007CI81IQ|3.0|There are lots of interesting ideas in this book but the narrative is spoiled by an overly polemic tone. I got bored about half way through sort of 'yes yes I get your point now get on with giving me the evidence.' An argument/narrative/voice is essential to any non-fiction book but unless you are preaching to the converted the reader also needs space to draw their own conclusions, that space was missing in this book.

0743297334|4.0|This was an interesting novel. It's a very simple story of some friends who go on a trip to a festival in spain. There are no real outstanding or shocking events in the book. It's just a narrative of a normal excursion. This book is not for everybody, many would find it extremely dull. But if you look closely, you see the underlying themes of a struggle for purpose in Post World War 1 europe. It's a pretty good book. I do think it's slightly overrated though.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|My wife and I first saw this film on a flight to Hawaii for our honeymoon. We are not usually fans of musicals and would not have seen it if it had not been the only film choice on this flight. This turned out to be a wonderful surprise and a very special film. I would highly recommend it!
0307744434|3.0|The book was very different and very well written but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I was disappointed in the luke-warm ending and the ultra-strange resolution of the relationship between the two main characters.
0812979656|5.0|The God of Small Things, by Arundhati Roy is one of my all-time favourite books. I read it first when I was seventeen and I've read it at least a dozen times since. There aren't enough superlatives to accurately describe this book! The author's writing style is utterly spellbinding. The images she conjures are breathtakingly evocative and her characters are completely heartbreaking.<br />Ms. Roy is a master storyteller. The story starts slowly and builds beautifully and with perfect unflawed timing to its resounding crescendo. There are many themes intricately woven into the plot; love, family and murder. It's an enthralling story that will make you think about the \\"small things\\" and their importance and significance. Everyone should read this book.

B00866H7SS|3.0|Some people believe that imitation is the greatest form of flattery, but I'm not so sure. I think if I was E.L. James I'd be a little irritated by the extent to which Sylvia Day has copied Fifty Shades. Bared to You has a very similar cover and an almost identical premise.<br />I felt uncomfortable reading about the intimate moments between two people who were abused as children. Of course, Eva and Gideon are consenting adults but part of me found their sex life quite disturbing. There was something very voyeuristic about that storyline. I felt that the characters needed help, but not from each other. Their relationship wasn't healthy; it was obsessive and possessive.<br />Fifty Shades was pure escapism for me and I applaud EL James for her success. There was something inexplicably captivating about the Fifty Shades storyline. Admittedly, there was too much sex, in my opinion, but the love story between Christian and Ana pulled me in. There was something about them that tugged at the heart strings and I felt a certain empathy for them. The characters in Bared to You were cold and lacking. It just didn't appeal to me.<br />You can't beat EL James, the original, in my opinion.

B004GTKP3S|5.0|I loved the Cranford series and was looking for Return to Cranford on Amazon for  some time.  Although the first one is good, Return to Cranford is even better with a more interesting storyline, characters, set designs, costumes, and performances. A huge fan of Dame Judy Dench, it's a joy to watch her in this series. She perfectly captures the sensibilities of a spinster in 1840s England, without being overly sentimental or unrealistic. I'm glad I bought it on Amazon Instant, rather than rent it, since this will be one watched again and again.

Searched the internet to find an affordable DVD, and came to Amazon.  Received the movie in a short while, put it in the player, and enjoyed it again.  Lent it to friends who said they liked it too.  To make a lomg story short, the movie was reasonably priced, arrived in a timely manner, and was very enjoyable.

Maybe I finally accepted I am a sugar addict and when I read that the most common craving for sugar is right after dinner despite my feeling full, I knew I had to get real. I liked the easy and direct writing. It's been over a month and I feel better. I don't have much craving and I still look forward to summer fruit but in moderation.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|:::::::::::Warning, all manner of spoilers ahead, ending revealed::::::::::::::<br /><br />Prometheus, who was killed by the gods for giving humans fire is the name of the ship and a reference to the aliens called Engineers, or at least to one of them. The opening is a DNA blowing CGI fest wherein a 10-ft-tall Engineer abandoned on a desolate and lifeless earth drinks a black genetic goo and is ripped apart at the molecular level scattering it's DNA about the waters of our planet.<br /><br />Cut ahead several thousand years cave paintings thousands of miles and years apart all depict the same 10ft engineer pointing to the same star cluster. Does it seem like weak science, yes! But that's the point, in fact they admit as much in the film. They go on the journey on the whim of a dying old trillionaire out to meet his maker and maybe cheat death. He's got nothing else to loose and he's using his own daughter and an android to lead the mission. So you can't take this as a \\"week-science\\" issue, because it's a leap of human faith to make the journey and the whim of a dying recluse with endless funds.<br /><br />There destination is moon in the same solar system as the Planet in Alien. There they discover vast numbers of dead Engineers (including at least one with a chest-burst!)and a mysterious life sign that keeps moving and disappearing (and is actually never found or explained - cue sequel)There's also a room of canisters vaguely resembling the Alien egg room but it's a visual only, these aren't eggs. There's more of the black-goo in them, and in that is tiny worms that have grown in it, these become the prototype of the famous face-hugger model.<br /><br />Part of the interest, and some of the complaints for this film start here. The worm doesn't just cause an alien to form, for example, but instead mutates and drives the infected insane. The \\"alien\\" is actually a more complicated creation, the \\"goo\\" is unwittingly ingested and the infected couples and impregnates our female scientist, she in-turns \\"gives birth\\" (through the most emergency c-section on film)and that \\"face hugger\\" will later attach to an Engineer and something similar to the \\"Alien\\" of the classic films is the result, and the end.<br /><br />Basically it seems many were expecting the goo to simply interact and cause the first \\"alien\\" but that's not the case, the film won't be that simplistic, the \\"alien\\" isn't even the purpose of the film, it's a side chapter.<br /><br />Turns out there is at least one living, but \\"sleeping\\" engineer, they wake him and learn more secrets, he attacks and tries to take a ship full of the deadly goo to Earth, there's sacrifice and he is stopped. However, there are more ships, many more and that strange life-sign knocking around as well as the proto-typical Alien at the last second of film. The one \\"survivor\\" goes off in search of the Engineers home world and we see several sequel opportunities including a more flat out Alien prequel (that would be a great idea, really, two sequels, one tracking the journey to the Engineers home the other filling in the gaps between this and Alien.) It would be especially unnerving to find out there was another crew lost before the Nostromo and that Waylend Industries sent them to the Alien ship knowing full well they'd all likely die (obviously they knew something, hence the issues with the android.)<br /><br />As far as \\"doesn't explain\\" well, Prometheus tells a story, and in that story the Characters never find all the answers, so, neither do we. And that's okay. It tells a complete tale, you could argue that cutting 15 - 20 minutes would take away the questions so people would stop complaining about not having answers but that would degrade the film.<br /><br />This is an awesome, I felt too short (if it's epic, make it 3hrs, the material was there!!!) film, it's not mindless action, it's not neat and tidy, it's more Shakespeare than Micheal Bay. So with that in mind, see it.female scientist, she in-turns \\"gives birth\\" (through the most emergency c-section on film)and that \\"face hugger\\" will later attach to an Engineer and something similar to the \\"Alien\\" of the classic films is the result, and the end.<br /><br />Basically it seems many were expecting the goo to simply interact and cause the first \\"alien\\" but that's not the case, the film won't be that simplistic, the \\"alien\\" isn't even the purpose of the film, it's a side chapter.<br /><br />Turns out there is at least one living, but \\"sleeping\\" engineer, they wake him and learn more secrets, he attacks and tries to take a ship full of the deadly goo to Earth, there's sacrifice and he is stopped.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I like this device. I use it primarily when working out, so that I can tune out background noise of the gym equipment. It does what it says. It amplifies the music, but does not compromise the sound quality. Nice feature is the ability to toggle through various preset EQ levels (ie rock, r&b, flat..etc) Only thing that could make this better is a clearer way to determine how much juice it has left. A couple of times when I thought it was charged, it died on me midway through a workout. User error to be sure, but this is why I gave 4 instead of 5. Slap on a better way to gauge battery life left, and it would be 5 stars for me.

144185696X|5.0|I'm a HUGE Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch fan, so I'm afraid I can't offer a \\"critical\\" review.  I loved this book, and love that Harry was not as depressed as he can sometimes be.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I listened to this book while commuting. What a great story!! Didn't see the end coming -- and that was great. I have recommended it to many people.

B00003CX95|5.0|Wow, here's yet another movie I may not have chosen to view!  When this was in the theater's I passed on this movie, because of maybe the trailers being shown on it!!<br /><br />Mistake!!  The movie is excellently written, acted and entirely believable.<br /><br />Love it!!!  Recommend this movie to anyone that wants to witness the passion and strength of a character that's willing to give their life for something they believe in!!  EXCELLENT MOVIE!!  Can you tell I like this one?? :)<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon for having the movie in stock and for making it available at an excellent value!<br /><br />Valarey
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle after listening to all the hype about it.  Whoever published this book, must have a great marketing team, because I bought into the buzz....  I got about 1/3 through the book and then couldn't read it any more.  While the storyline, was ok, the writing is horrible.  Wow... how did this ever get published?
030758836X|4.0|What a fantastic read. suspenseful and intelligent and entertaining.  I had a few issues with minor plot development plausibility, but beyond that, wow. My husband, a skeptical  reader to say the least, loved it as much as I did.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a poorly written book.  Everything about it, from the characters, to the plot, to the dialog, and event he sex scenes was absolutely terribly written.  This is another book written by a woman that debases the entire gender.  And this is not a reference to the \\"BDSM\\" references throughout the book.  The main female character was a weak-willed, simpering, whiny, idiot.  The main  male character was one of the worst examples of a \\"Dom\\" I have ever seen or read about.<br /><br />Don't bother reading this book, much less paying for it.  This is the internet.  Go and find GOOD smut to read.  Smut with good sex scenes, better characters, and smut that only makes you feel dirty in all the good ways.  And you can probably find it for free.
B008BM9L72|2.0|There was very little in the way of a deep storyline to these books.  The majority of the story was just porn and became very difficult to read.  I'm not sure I would recommend this read to anyone.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|As a motorcyclist that grew up in California, there is a certain understanding I have when watching this show. Very entertaining. Its great to see Katie Sagal in something again too.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was such a great read,I literally couldnt put the book down. I finished the book in no time, and have already bought the other two. If you like romance novels this is great, it has some kinkiness, but the intimate parts don't take up the whole book. Check it out! :)
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I found that I liked the story line of the book. It was well balanced with a good amount of banter between the main characters.I found the erotic components to be inoffensive. I immediately bought the next book ater I had been left hanging at the end of the first. Can't wait to see where this one goes!

B005FISBTO|2.0|Dexter Season 6 did not disappoint me at all it was the 2-minute SHOWTIME advertisement that I was forced to watch before every disc. I know two minutes is really short but the fact that I couldn't hit menu, fast forward or skip on a DVD that I purchased was extremely frustrating! I would love to get this fixed for any future viewings.
1932735410|4.0|Thanks and Yes I had received it safely. But a concern please , when I tried to use the CD which is given in the PMP book it is asking me for the License Serial Number. It says that the License Serial Number is inside the cover of the CD but I could not see that if I am right !<br /><br />So when I tried to use the CD it says the info as Site Code is C66B 0F55 E1A2 6394 07 and asks me for the<br /><br />License Serial Number<br /> ???<br /><br />Now can you please let me know regarding this.

B007STBUIW|5.0|I just received the Jaws [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)disks.<br /><br />Much to my surprise they (Universal) included not only their Ultraviolet digital copy BUT also included the iTunes code to redeem. No hassles.<br /><br />The best part is when you redeem the iTunes code you are downloading three things:<br /><br />1) HD (yes HD) digital copy of Jaws, weighing in at 4.51 GB.<br />2) non HD version of Jaws, 1.97 GB this is all I was expecting...<br />3) Jaws iTunes Extras / Steven Spielberg, 1.76 GB<br /><br />About 8.3GB total.<br /><br />Good job Universal, I take back all those bad things I thought about you when you were trying to force me into Ultraviolet digital copies...<br /><br />P.S. The digital copies must be redeemed by 4/30/15. Nice, almost 3 years.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|Daniella Obraztsov IMO has done an excellent review on this series, and that being the case, I can't see the point in repeating what she has commented on here. I basically agree with her review, and to anyone reading this, please read the books first, then watch the DVD/recorded series. You will not get an accurate portrayal of the stories otherwise. The producers strayed so far the books, it was in a word, pathetic. The Undying scene for instance, wasn't anything like the book. There was so much more to Jon's story left out. The battle scene towards the end in the book, was nothing like the DVD. Tyrion was in the heat of the battle on one of the sinking ships, when saved by his squire, not out side the castle walls. There was no mention or sight of his famous chain in the river. There was so many important parts of the story left out, that to me, the series made little sense. The producers should have taken the time to write the adaptation more acturately and include a few more episodes if necessary, to get it right. Yes I realise they have a budget, but it's the old story, do it right, or don't do it at all. Fantastic books, and I take my hat off to Martin, how he kept track of all those story lines is beyond me. I won't waste my money buying Series 3 when it is released, I'll wait for it to come out on Fox and record it. For all us GOT fans, I hope it's heaps better than this one.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This movie was the best invasion flick in years. It is hands down better than Battle Los Angeles. The movie has the same feel as Independence Day in that the characters and events are not 100% serious and it does not try to be a technically accurate sci-fi. It's about excitement and fun - not blood and gore. It's about people and not big strategy; the strategy has its flaws just like Independence Day. The special effects are excellent, not cheesy. The movie is not as epic like Independence Day and remains tightly focused on a few characters. I highly recommend this flick for a less cerebral night at the movies.

0441020712|5.0|This was for me a thoroughly enjoyable novel. I'm very particular about my science fiction, and this latest from Reynolds beckoned me every time I put it down. I'm glad I purchased the hardback version to keep on the shelf with the others that follow. Some books are perfect for the Kindle, but this is one of those gems that deserves to be held and have its pages turned with the whisper of paper and words.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This thing is great. Its nice to know where my battery is at first thing when I open my Kindle for the day.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not like the somewhat hopeless outcome of the book.  The author is so innovative I felt sure she would come forth with an  an \\"O. Henry\\" bit of irony and justice. Many friends liked the book very much, and as it is a best seller I must be the odd man out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It takes some critical thinking on the higher levels to solve. My only complaint is the levels that don't use all the squares with the most efficient route between corresponding dots. It makes you go pointlessly all over the board just to fill every square.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Gameplay is okay, but ads are easy for kit to accidentally hit. Thay purposely make it tough to exit the game. So this one is a no go for my family.
B005FJ7EIC|1.0|Wanted to see movie but since amazon had bandwidth issues could  not view and no way to get refund. Horrible service and system.<br />K
B004KDO2G6|5.0|We all get used to fine music making from this team - but this is one of the best. This was the final concert that Abbado gave with this orchestra as the chief conductor and the affection that the orchestra and Abbado shared with each other is quite evident throughout and the orchestra clearly rise to this very special occasion. The venue for this concert was Palermo in Italy so to some extent Abbado is playing to the home crowd and they love it with copious flowers raining down from the boxes and balconies at the end.<br /><br />The Brahms violin concerto with Gil Shaham has come to be regarded as outstanding in a crowded market and is well able to be compared favourably with the best. A good forward momentum is maintained without any feeling of undue hurry. The playing of Shaham and the orchestra is fully sensitive to every nuance but this is done without undue expressive heaviness.<br /><br />The Dvorak has the tremendous drive and spontaneity that you can get at some live concerts. As with the Brahms, there is a good forward momentum maintained but combined with sensitive playing from the orchestra and the soloists within the orchestra. This is a very exciting `live' experience.<br /><br />The Verdi Overture encore maintains this excitement and this becomes to be a thrilling end to a particularly memorable event.<br /><br />The whole concert is in good sound and with sympathetic camera work. The recording was made in 2002 and with genuine HD recording equipment. The producer, Paul Smaczny, had started using HD recording equipment since about 2000 and this results in crisp imaging and wide ranging sound presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. (Another example of genuine HD recording and dating from 2000 is the Wagner Ring as conceived and conducted by Maazel).<br /><br />This recording has achieved considerable recognition as a special event over the intervening years. The DVD was a notable success but the Blu-ray edition adds significantly to that. Both options provide a deeply satisfying musical experience which should give purchasers equivalent pleasure. It seems totally reasonable to recommend this disc as being worth a full 5 stars therefore in either format.which should give purchasers equivalent pleasure.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Lives up to the Hype! Was captivated in every chapter the smutty parts are well described while holding your attentiopn to the story line. It's a romance, smutt, adventure all in one.
B0064JV4LU|5.0|I just watched this movie last night at The Neon in Dayton, OH and I can't stop thinking about it! It was more that great, it was essential, it's good for the heart and soul.<br /><br />This story is about a parapalegic man who has had many tragedies in his life, but he is so financially well off you can barely tell. His life has been one way and he has been treated one way only. Then walks in this man, who is a grown man in age but not so much mentally, with no job and no real motivation to work, he would rather hang on the street corner with his boys.<br /><br />Then BAM! their worlds collide in such a seamless fashion that you know it was meant to be. The camaraderie that happens in a matter of moments resonates throughout the whole film. Subtitles shmubtitles, who cares what you don't like, go see this movie, and if you have a heart, even a little one, you will leave the theatre full and satisfied, I guarantee it.
0307744434|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading The Night Circus. If I could, I would create new words to describe it, because \\"enchanting,\\" \\"whimsical,\\" \\"spellbinding,\\" \\"mesmerizing\\" all seem too pale and overused to describe the experience of this extraordinary tale. I probably read 200+ books a year, and I don't know if I have ever read another book that filled me with such a seamless sense of delight and wonder as this. I won't copy the work of other reviewers and give a summary of the book. I will just say that reading this book has left my spirit sated and cat-that-ate-the-cream content. What a remarkable achievement! And no, I am not related to and I do not know the author!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is much clearer than previous examples of its type. As far as I am able to tell, all the important computer operations and functions are covered in this book which should allow the novice writer to successfully achieve kindle designed books. The continuity of this book is good, for example, it starts with the formatting of the word file that you wish to upload, then covers how to handle picture inserts and goes on to cover the later stages of production, search options, covers, uploading to kindle, etc. All in all this book is easy to read, informative and it is hard to see how it can be improved upon, unless an individual expert in kindle design is looking to explore in detail a specific function.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|The Raid is a vicious and energetic Indonesian action flick that tells the story of a squad of heavily armed cops who invade a tenement building run by a big time drug lord. When the raid does not go as planned, the surviving officers must fight to stay alive and try to escape from deep within enemy territory. Writer/Director Gareth Evans does a great job of providing us with numerous action scenes of ballistic intensity. Whether it's machine guns or knives or when things go hand to hand, we get treated to some crazy and kinetic action that's back to basics, balls to the wall, kick ass style. No John Woo glossiness here (Not that there's anything wrong with that. Love JohnWoo). It's just blood soaked and tooth and nail. It's like a Shaw Borthers movie on crack...and lots of it. The Indonesian fighting style adds a uniqueness to the fights and Evans' camera captures all the rapid fire moves of his martial arts savvy cast. And best of all, Evans also knows to back up his action with some good suspense, some strong drama and a few nice plot twists along the way. He also knows to let us catch our breath now and then so we are ready and waiting for the next life and death struggle. And we get plenty of those. Sure there are some flaws and it is vicious and brutally violent but, it also is an entertaining and exhilarating action crime thriller.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|get the hd version it has the migthy eagle and it has free powerups :p dont get this just get the hd one its only two dollars more.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|But this one had me unable to put it down.  Humorous, real characters, and a twisting plot that you couldn't guess the ending.  Only thing, sometimes I found it hard to follow the jumping back and forth in time.
B000BT97AO|3.0|Was excited to see this movie, especially since my husband & I love Jim Henson's work. We were a little let down with this movie though. It was interesting, but if you are expecting to see his incredible muppets (which we were) you will be sorely disappointed. It has wonderful effects and is NOT a bad movie, but I was expecting something a little different. Worth giving a try, but look around and don't pay full price for it.
B007OUINLC|1.0|The most unsexy sex I've seen since a comedy involving falling on a bannana peel and knocking over lamps. With all the Victorian layers of clothing and sexual repression, what fun this movie could have had slowly peeling away the layers. Instead we get the opposite of eroticism- sudden shots to the middle of a sex scene that could not possibly be less erotic. Middles are never good- show us the beginning. There's no foreplay. It's ironic because the rest of the movie is so slow that when slowness is needed, it's fast! In addtion, there is bad acting all around. Keira especially overacts so much i couldnt bear it. Everones accent is wrong. Dialogue slow. False Embellishments to the real story of freud vs jung. Also .Not a single redeeming feature.  Cant' believe i paid 13 bucks for that!

B001TCHDPS|5.0|How did we overlook this person in the 70s? Rodriguez was as talented as any of those song writers, singers we all knew and loved in that era.  His music is brilliant - such magnificent and powerful words. And he can really sing and play a guitar. Can these songs really be 40 years old?  We are extremely fortunate that he was such a success in South Africa and that over the years two people were driven to find him and learn the true story. Rodriguez's music is as relevant and moving today as it was then and has a very strong message. His song \\"Cause\\" starting with \\"cause I lost my job two weeks before Christmans...could be a song about our world today. \\"Climb Up On My Music\\" takes me back to another time.  May he find success, happiness and wealth from this new awakening of his music. Rodriguez, I celebrate you.
0345803485|1.0|I am an aspiring novelist in the young adult genre, just finishing my first book and undertaking the horrifyingly difficult task that is publication. I have had four full rewrites demanded of my by potential literary agents. All the repetitive words have been changed; all my sentence formations have been questioned and improved upon, etc. The list goes on.<br /><br />And somehow, because there is no justice in the world, this book makes it to the top of the best seller list. I found blatant typos, quotations in the wrong places, obvious grammatical errors all over the place! It's unbelievable.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be mean. All writers make mistakes. But didn't somebody edit this thing?<br /><br />I read all the Twilight books and had to concede that, although they were awkward and over-the-top, she had a great story and an ability to keep the pace moving. This is an outrageous imitation of the first Twilight book-- she even rips off major plot elements, not to mention characters and setting.<br /><br />It was like the writer put down Twilight and said, \\"Damn, I wish I could see Edward and Bella do the nasty, but I'm not into the vampire thing,\\"  then started writing fan fiction.<br /><br />Weirdly, the characters speak like they're British.<br />(\\"Turn round\\", he says and cups my bottom.)<br /><br />This virgin goes nympho without ever having had a single sexual experience, with no character development to explain it. The main character has no personality; the male lead is just...awful.<br /><br />I can't say any more. It's awful. I want my six hours back. I was curious. This is what I get. It's my punishment. I can't un-read it. I have a compulsion to finish every book I start. Ugh.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Where to begin....  I love this album. The words and the music are so spiritual and just timeless.  My biggest regret is that 40 years were lost and I hope that in the future Rodriguez will continue to create and release more music.  What a remarkable story to learn that this album became symbolic and was an inspiration to so many people during such a troubling time in South Africa. Rodriguez is undeniably a living legend. Take your time when you listen to this CD.  Enjoy the beat, listen to words and appreciate the gift he has given us.  His story is an inspiration to all.

B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|this album has so much potential. but it is sad to say that it just didnt reach it. having said that this album is not too bad, it is a HUGE improvement from their near terrible last album but does not stand even close to hybrid theory or meteora. And the sad and painful thing is, it could of done and should of done.<br /><br />starting with lost in the echo rating 7/10 this track had so much potential, because it was so high in energy and it had the rap rock style lp used to have, having said that this track was ruined by all the synth and techno dominating the guitar. now i don't mind a little bit of techno but not when it blocks out the guitar i hate that. if they had let the guitar come out of the wind surrounded by techno this track would of been a hundred times better and i probably would of given it a 10 although this is quite a good track it could of been so much better<br /><br />in my remains rating 6.5/10 this song was quite good the lyrics and vocals were well done. but the guitar sounds like it is from a cheesy coldpay song. once again musically it should have been much better but not a bad track overall<br /><br />burn it down rating 5.5/10 this is the albums hit single and i can see why. musically this song is quite good but still could of been improved by less synth and more guitar, but that not the problem i have with this song. lyrically this is a pop song im sorry guys but the lyrics of this song are not up to scratch im mean really, we're building it up to break it back down we're building it up to burn it down we cant wait to burn it to the ground really! thats the best analogy you can come up with. i totally understand why this song is in the charts because it is just a shout out to be played at 16 year olds birthday partys but musically this song is saved from being terrible<br /><br />lies greed misery rating 5/10 this song is such a disappointment and it could of been so much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the structure is similar to bleedit out of minutes to midnight but does not even stand up close to that track. lyrically and vocally this song is ok because the energy is really high but musically it is TERRIBLE! they try to create this dubstep sound with a little bit of distorted guitar and it just doesnt fit into the high power of this song. disappointed<br /><br />ill be gone rating 7.5/10 this song is one of the better tracks on this album musically it is ok and vocally it is pretty good but its nothing special, its definitely not a memorable track but is is decent enough<br /><br />castle of glass rating 8/10 i was plesantly surprised by this song! although the lyrics in the chorus arnt great vocally and musically it is a very good track, everything fits together i was hoping for a huge chorus at the end but it is still a very good track<br /><br />victimised 9/10 i loved this track it was so powered with energy, one of the few tracks where you could hea the guitar over the synth the only reason im not giving it a 10 is because it was way too short!<br /><br />roads untravelled rating 8/10 this song is very good! took me a while to get used but now i am really starting to like it i cant actually find any synth on this song the guitar really does shine vocally and lyrically it is also very good the only thing i would of liked is a more creative chorus , good song though<br /><br />skin to bone rating 3/10 this song is not good, musically and lyrically. the music sounds like its been recycled from a lmfao song and the lyrics are plain awful! i mean honestly skin to bone dust to dust ash to ashes right to left and left to right  STUPID! a ten year old can write better lyrics then that the only reason im giving it a 3 and not a 1 is because the energy was decent but overall not a good song extremely reppetive<br /><br />until it breaks rating 2.5/10 this song has to be the worst on the album it does not fit at all mike shinoda does a nice rap but the lyrics are so dumb it makes me laugh and especially the last part of the song. it sounded so stupid and didnt fit in at all with the rest of the song i would like to give it a 1 but mikes rapping was ok. overall terrible track<br /><br />tinfoil (interlude) rating 8/10 nice intro to powerless<br /><br />powerless rating 8/10 a very nice end to the album the lyrics and vocals are powerful and so is the guitar! the guitar sounds great on this song,  little bit corny in places but overall a solid track<br /><br />overall rating 78/120  an album which could have been much better in places but is a solid step in the right direction for linkin park as it was much better then a thousand suns hopefully next album there will be less synth and more guitar.[[ASIN:B008B3H4VQ Living Things]]

034580404X|5.0|I bought this set for my daughter-in-law and when she was done with a book she gave it to me. I was hooked immediately! I'm on the last chapter of the 3rd book and OMG...I loved every moment of reading it. It has been a long time since I read a book that held my interest as long as it did and couldn't wait until the next book! E.L.James is an amazing writer!
1400082773|1.0|Completely stupid book that glorifies socialism in its worse form. I was shocked to see the lack of education on Obamas part. WOW.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I liked it at first. it was good for music but after a while when I went to download a new song it wouldn't play. it would say playback error
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Keane have delivered another fantastic album. Like their debut \\"Hopes and Fears\\", there are so many standout tunes on this album that lesser bands would have stretched this output over multiple albums. But this is by no means a retreat to their debut sound, as some  professional reviewers have mistakenly claimed. This album builds on everything Keane have done before with an easy touch born of maturity.  There is the same emotional intensity as \\"Under the Iron Sea\\", but without the unrelenting darkness of that masterpiece. It retains the airy 80s feel of \\"Perfect Symmetry\\", but with more deft and restraint.  The end result is the most complete album they have produced to date.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I originally started Rick Riordan with Percy Jackson and The Lighting Theif (the movie, not the book). I liked the movie so much I read the book and the next and the next and all 5, then moved to Heroes of Olympus series and loved them too. Unfortuately, I had (still waiting) for the third installment of the series and decided to give this book a go... what a good choice. It moved fans from Greek and Roman gods and mythology to Egyptian gods and mythology... Very entertaining and keeps moving. It is written in a brother/sister format which my 13 year old daughter REALLY liked. Fantastic book again by Rick Riordan!!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|How many times can you regurgitate the same movie? Like many have said the movie was a visual feast but if you already have the 3-d version then this is going to be nothing new except they put it in a new package and added the words \\"Collector's Edition\\". Then add a new extra or two.<br /> I can wait for the extended version.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|\\"The White Album\\" is surrounded by so much myth and legend that it's difficult to see it clearly through the lens we must use to see into the past -- specifically 44 years into the past, back to its 1968 release.<br /><br />Yes, this was the album that sent mass murderer Charles Manson over the edge, although if it hadn't been this, something else would have. Yes, this is the album featuring the notorious Lennon/McCartney composition \\"Helter Skelter,\\" although it should be noted that Manson's interpretation of the song was thoroughly insane.<br /><br />And yes, this is one of the Beatles albums on which the band members often worked by themselves -- or rather on which John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison often worked separately from one another; apparently Ringo Starr does do most if not all the drumming (McCartney played drums on a couple of the tracks when even the affable Ringo got disgusted and quit temporarily).<br /><br />What's amazing about this album is how good it is even though the group members were at odds with one another. The songs they brought to the project were incredibly strong. One, \\"Don't Pass Me By,\\" is credited to Starr (or his real name Richard Starkey). Lead guitarist George Harrison contributed four songs: \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Piggies,\\" \\"Savoy Truffle\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long.\\" The other 25 songs were credited to rhythm guitarist John Lennon and bassist/keyboardist Paul McCartney, although their songwriting partnership really wasn't active anymore. Hence, it's common knowledge now that \\"Dear Prudence,\\" for example, was a Lennon song, whereas \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" was McCartney, and so on.<br /><br />So it wasn't a cohesive album, but it offered some of the most fascinating music of the Beatles' career as a band. Lennon's best tunes ranged from the raucous \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" to the understated \\"Julia\\" to the gritty \\"Yer Blues.\\" McCartney contributed several fine songs, including the pensive \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and the rather notorious \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" Harrison's four songs were the best of his career up to that point, especially the scathing \\"Piggies\\"; he would transcend even these offerings, though, with \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" on \\"Abbey Road.\\" Starr's \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" was slighter than the songs of his bandmates but still quite pleasant.<br /><br />The Beatles, as they always had, were not afraid to experiment with instrumentation, going far beyond the usual rock 'n' roll tools of guitars, bass and drums. Instruments on \\"The White Album,\\" much of it played by the band members themselves but some contributed by session musicians, included piano, organ, harmonium, strings, brass, woodwinds and timpani.<br /><br />The album also featured one of the strangest \\"songs\\" in the Beatles canon, the sound-effect/spoken-word/musical montage \\"Revolution 9.\\"<br /><br />I consider this to be a cornerstone album of my music collection. It's rich and kaleidoscopic; its stylistic diversity makes it an album that can be played over and over again. Highly recommended.ccoon\\" and the rather notorious \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\" Harrison's four songs were the best of his career up to that point, especially the scathing \\"Piggies\\"; he would transcend even these offerings, though, with \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" on \\"Abbey Road.\\" Starr's \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" was slighter than the songs of his bandmates but still quite pleasant.<br /><br />The Beatles, as they always had, were not afraid to experiment with instrumentation, going far beyond the usual rock 'n' roll tools of guitars, bass and drums.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I started watching Firefly after seeing the movie Serenity  years ago. I was amazed on what a great story it was, the acting was phenomenal. I didn't want it to end. I didn't know that there was a TV show. I watched the DVD extras and found out there, so I went to iTunes and bought the bunch. WOW! I still watch them now, about 1x per year.
1476712042|5.0|How do I even begin a review about this book? I have no idea, because it was just that amazing. I loved every second of this book. Beware; this isn't your typical YA book. It is actually new adult and it deals with adult things. It isn't suitable for readers under 16 or so. If you're over 16 then read on! J    Cover:  I really like the cover! It's super cute! The cover is simple and pretty. To me, it kind of symbolizes a feeling of being trapped, and hating that feeling. Also, I really like the butterfly. J    Plot/Writing:  Every second of this book was an up and down. There were moments when I was jumping for joy, wanting to shake Abby and Travis, and then jumping and squealing again. I loved it. I stayed up till all hours of the night reading Beautiful Disaster! You were drawn into the ups and downs of Travis and Abby's very messed up relationship. When I say messed up, I mean it. Their relationship wasn't healthy, but they made it work. I am going to direct you to In between Writing and Reading because she made some great points and I applaud her for this post!    Characters:  Abby was running away from her old life. She spent the whole book with walls up and well, it was a little annoying. There are rare moments when you see her with her walls down and those are when she is the best. She meets Travis in the first scene of the book and you just watch their relationship escalate into something more than friendship. I was amazed by her strength and courage throughout the whole book. I know that at some points she was a little much, but at others it was amazing watching her journey.    Travis is another story. He's the typical tough boy player who doesn't let anyone see the real him. Yet, when he's around Abby he opens up and shows her the real Travis, the one with the crazy family and someone who just wants to be happy and stop fighting everything in his life. There are many different versions of Travis in this book, and yet you love everyone of them. For the mostpart.    All in all:  I really loved this book. I am writing this book after almost 3 weeks after reading the book and it is still on my mind. If that shows you anything about the book, then you should definitely buy it. Just bare with the book and the characters, it really is an amazing journey of college kids trying to find themselves. Happy reading!    In Between Writing and Reading Review: [...]
B006JD48NM|5.0|great film for the race fan and those that can learn something about formula one racing. a must see film for everyone.
030758836X|4.0|At first when reading this book, it kind of started off real slow for me. I didn't know what to expect since it wasn't grabbing my attention. After getting about 1/4 into the book it started picking up and i couldn't put it down. It starts with the couple being happy and then finally you get a twist like what the heck is going on and then another. it was great all the way until the end- it kind of left a cliffhanger to me.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I just put 2 16 gb flash cards into this little miracle. Now I have 32 gb in my PSP, little over 20 games. Amazing! Thanks. Be advise the seller is in China, so shipping take time, but I know that before I places the order, so no complain there, just be forewarned it will take longer than usual to come. If you thinking about adding memory to your PSP, don't think, it really works.

0316069884|5.0|Parts of this book were very difficult to read and parts of it drove me to tears. I encourage all my friends, especially those who eat meat, to read it. And before some of you carnivores get your feathers ruffled, it does not necessarily proselytize for converting to a Vegetarian/Vegan diet, but there is important information in it that you need to know. Especially if you want to be a responsible meat eater. Information about your health, the environment and your humanity. Brilliantly and lovingly written.
0307346617|5.0|A spectacular read! Very well written with detail you would expect from someone who actually lived, fought, and survived the zombie war. Such a great read that I have been unable to put it down! It's so entertaining I keep reading it over and over! One of the best books I have read!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Maze Runner trilogy and I was really excited about this prequel. I have to admit that what I expected was something more related to WICKED and the Trials. This book was very good as apocalyptic science fiction goes, but as a prequel I would have prefered to get something more closely related to the trilogy itself. The opening scene with Teresa was a bit misleading in that respect and seemed to me a bit forced. I actually would have loved it if Dashner had taken that idea and ran with it, because that has so much potential for a great prequel that would actually give us background information to understanding the plot of the trilogy. I also thought that the characters in this book were a bit under-developed and I would have liked to have more information about Mark's life before the sun flares and to see more development of Mark and Trina's relationship, not to mention more focus on other characters such as Lana. However, all in all I enjoyed this book and the quality of the writing was definitely up to Dashner's usual standard. I would love to see another book added to this set focusing on the characters of the Maze Runner trilogy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game with so many mini games to choose from there is always one to keep the grandkids entertained thanks

B005ILWOZA|2.0|I thought I would really enjoy this after listening to some of the sample tracks and I really loved the song/video for \\"I Wont Let You Go\\".  I wasn't really all that familiar with James Morrison's music but this was a big disappointment for me.  There were only a couple of songs that I somewhat liked and the rest were not music to my ears at all.  I've only played it a couple of times and probably won't listen to it again.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just received the Amazon Basic Backpack yesterday. Far as I can tell it seems to be well made and very sturdy.  I was able to fit my dlsr, zoom lens, battery charger, flash, filters, point and shoot camera and misc items with room to add more. I also really like all the extra pockets.  Can't wait to get out and put it to use!  For $35 you can't beat it. And received it in 4 business days.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins and many of the other members of the New Atheist movement fancy themselves to be messianic figures here to spread the truth to us ill-equipped laymen on the subjects of science and religion.  Under the assumption that the Judaic-Islamic-Christian concept of a monotheistic deity can be the only definition of God, they pride themselves in their abilities to squabble with Christian, Judaic, and Islamic apologists on the internet, public television, and in books.  Instead of championing empirical evidence that clearly shows there is no such thing as god, divinity, or spirit, the books by the authors of the New Atheist movement usually degrade into metaphysical ramblings in response to age-old philosophical treatises such as Pascal's wager and abstract metaphors that are supposed to illustrate that there is no god, never was, and never will be.<br /><br />With sensationalist shock-and-awe tactics such as the choice to title their books with such gems as \\"The God Delusion\\", \\"God is Not Great\\", and \\"The End of Faith\\", the new atheists seem to have just as much faith as the religious fundamentalists that they so much oppose.  Open only to the possibility that their own personal beliefs are the truth, the new atheists are on a crusade to convert as many people as they can to the atheist wtorldview with their beloved scientific method.  Thanks to these truly \\"righteous\\" fellows, many religious fundamentalists are becoming even more scared of science once they come into contact with the new atheist folk, because lo and behold, they simply view them as a threat to their way of life.  The radical, countercultural ideals espoused by individuals such as Richard Dawkins call to mind the psychedelic Gurus of the 1960s with their sheer refusal to think of the possibility that maybe a respectful approach to the issues at hand will get more done than a radical approach to combatting modern ideals and attempting to shift the mainstream's view on subjects such as the existence ofgod and the value of science.<br /><br />This country was founded on the basis of democracy, a respectful discourse between individuals holding different points of view in an attempt to sustain equality and happiness and a melting pot of different viewpoints and ideals in which we can all grow and learn from one another.  What we have in the literature of the New Atheist movement is a spark that has ignited a cultural firestorm that will ultimately cause an infinitely greater amount of problems than a healthy dose of scientific thinking and a question of the existence of god could ever hope to solve.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|Very unique movie. I myself thoroughly enjoyed it! The morbidity of it is enticing. The dirty man who needs to clean his nails is out seeking the arousal of a woman's deadly scent. Serial killer returning home to be devoured. It is unlike any movie I have ever seen. Though close to the end it becomes very easily predetermined as to what he will do next, it concludes in a way you have never thought. Must see. At least once.
0345803507|4.0|I am actually very surprised to see how many people dislike the fifty shades series. Almost every review that I see gives a one or two star rating, and has some form of a 'This sucks' title. Come on guys, it's not that bad!<br /><br />I absolutely loved Fify Shades Freed, in my opinion it is the best book out of the three by far! The two before it are mainly a messed up love story, but the third book is actually comprised of love, a wedding, and even some intense action! I very much enjoyed the various Epilogoues as well after the story reached it's conclusion. One of them is the interview between Ana and Christian from the first book, but from Christain's point of view. It was very interesting to read.<br /><br />This book is no literary masterpeice, but it is a very good read for anyone looking for an interesting love story.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Eye popping and jaw dropping 3d effects! Hands down..I have watched the Panasonic 3D bluray version, and I know that this is not the same, but most likely this version could be better than the Panasonic's..<br /><br />Watching it is like your part of the movie and it's like the first you've watched it. Jungle scene was really awesome! The plants, ferns, etc was really out of this world and absolutely wonderful! The separation of objects/items/people to the background have great depth that makes you think it's in front of you, and some parts make you feel your in the movie.  Wwwoooaaaahhhh! Every 3d bluray movies should be made like this. I have watched other 3d bluray movies, and the pop-out effects are not as good as this.<br /><br />The end result is a perfect 3d video that truly shows the spirit and emotion of the film.<br /><br />I know this 3d bluray release is very very very late already for a 2009 film, but I'm not gonna comment about that anymore. I'm just saying my experience when I watched this 3d bluray.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Worth every penny!
034580404X|4.0|I thought these books were really good. Super addicting! I finished all three in like 2 wks and I'm not an avid reader. I def recommend. I wish I would have just borrowed them from somebody instead of buying b/c I'll never read them again, but still a good read.
B00821OX98|4.0|If you like scifi shows, this is a great one to watch.  action, drama and aliens, how could you go wrong.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This rocks for a sleepy app! I have trouble sleeping and Relax helps alot. I will buy the paid version whenever they come down on the price!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book is a very good read..Sparks is amazing like always !:) I couldn't put the put down when i started..!
1466401885|4.0|I found that I could completely relate to the main character and her being torn between what she thinks she wants to be and what she really is and following her heart vs. following her head. It made me nostalgic for my youth falling in love for the first time and being with someone you know is not right for you. Well written, easy read. I feel the author could have gone more into depth with the character's feelings, but my imagination filled in the blanks. All in all, I loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my whole family is amused by this one. the 9 year old and the 17 year old (a much as a teen will let on). I like it too. the larger blocks do get challenging enough to make it fun!

B004XANKVO|5.0|I've have this backpack for a while now, and it is indeed sturdy, which is what I expected when I first got it based on the quality of construction.  While the aesthetic design elements could be better, the overall practical design is superlative for a backpack.  Even though it is quite expensive, if you travel a bit and have some stuff to haul, this would be a good backpack choice.  Beyond the padded pocket for electronics, I really like the hard shell case up top for sunglasses, camera, etc.  And the open face \\"shove-it\\" pocket is a good stowaway for a light jacket/sweatshirt.  The shoulder straps are comfortable and the cross-chest strap is good for longer walks.  I wish I was a little taller as the bottom of the backpack does dig a little into my rear hip. All in all, a pricey, but really well designed backpack.
B005C6HGSG|4.0|I loved this book. I read the whole book with Bobby's voice speaking in my head. It was very fun! I mesure how much I like a book in how fast I finished and since English isn't my first language sometimes I need to take several breaks. Not with this book!. Didn't put it down until it was finished.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Slammed is a \\"cute love\\" story about Will and Lake.<br />Quick overview - (for those of us who don't like lengthy review)<br />This story is not a Romance story; it is more of unforeseen struggles of young adulthood.<br />Lake moved to Michigan from Texas after her father's death, like any 18 year only, she already hates the move.  Then she meets Will (21) and his young brother (9) the neighbor, and the story takes a different twist... Lake likes Will, Will likes Lake, and can't be together.... :(<br /><br />This is a YA read, high school level, and I would recommend this book to that age group.<br />If you were a fan of the 50 Shades trilogy, Beautiful Disaster, Twilight trilogy, Gone Girl, just to name a few, then you will find this book \\"a bore\\" that is why I gave it a 3 stars. This books is a cute story but honestly not a \\"best seller\\" and should not categorize as Romance by Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy is you decide to read... read with an open mind of a YA!<br /><br />** just finished reading the second book - Point of Retreat, the continuation for Slammed is so much better!! Point of Retreats starts off where Slammed left,  I recommend Slammed, just to read Point of Retreat! **
0307744434|1.0|I know this book is feverishly adored by many readers.  The author certainly creates a magical, mystical world with the circus, and her descriptive prose are good.  The problem was the plot.  There wasn't much of one.  The novel lacked a strong narrative drive.  All the enchanting descriptions by themselves were not enough to keep me up all night,  wondering what was going to happen next.  What wafer-thin plot there was devolved into a typical syrupy love story.  The mysterious and supernatural elements are undercooked, watered down, and never fully explored.  It could have been so much more.<br />I'm learning that the book industry is very much like the music industry, or the movie industry;  they all jump on \\"trends.\\"  How much does Hollywood spend on brainless blockbusters, sequels and remakes?  What's with all the generic pop garbage clogging up the top of the music charts?  And the book industry is not much different.  There are at least a half-dozen knock-offs of The Help floating around (some of them quite good).  The Night Circus was not garbage by any means, but what kept coming to my mind as I was reading was:  this is like Harry Potter for grown-ups.  Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but never forget rule number one:  you've got to tell a good story.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Pretty catchy theme, I love the background in this game. This game will keep you busy, you'll love the game as it will keep you on your toes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the most gripping science fiction books i have ever read. I instantly felt interested in the characters and their fates. I highly recomend this to everyone.
B005FITIK0|1.0|Okay, so I saw this movie the other night thinking it would be alright due to the cast/writer and director, however I ended up being extremely disappointed by this awfully boring, long excuse of a movie.  So first of, Charlize Theron's character is an absolute psychotic home-wrecking bitch who you have no sympathy for for the whole movie, not even at the end because she learns NOTHING.  Honestly, people who are trying to justify this character's 'development' are seriously kidding themselves, she's an awful person and stays that way, however in the end she realizes that she needs to just live her life and 'grow up', yet she shows no signs of any progress...to put it simply, this movie is no more entertaining than watching paint dry.  The plot goes nowhere, there is no climax or character development.  And the lack of music in the majority of the scenes is awkward and adds a serious tone to almost every scene, the preview for this movie was very deceiving.  All in all, the movie blows, you stick around waiting for it to get better but then it ends and you sit there wondering how they could make such a crappy movie with really great actors and a good team of film makers/writers behind it...
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Product great but was upset that the entire series appeared the next day on Netflix :-(  Guess that's my fault for not looking.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This was recommended by a friend as a great book.  I found it engaging in the 'Then and Now' perspectives.  It dragged a bit at times and was predictable at others.  The trial was well written with the twists and turns, flips and flops resembling the great roller coaster rides of today.  The ending left me feeling a bit let down, kinda of an 'Oh Well' feeling.

B001DCQI82|5.0|Karajan's rendition of Beethoven's symphonies is gripping. Especially, I am in awe of the ninth where the sublime meets the exuberant. Attend to the moment in the last movement, just before the bass soloist sings the recitatives already anticipated by cellos and basses. It feels very much like the Apollonian transfigures itself into the Dionysian. And Karajan is superb in achieving this miracle.
0345803485|5.0|I don't get how this book or series in general could ever get below 4stars. This book is a perfect start to this triology and I wasn't disappointed. Just left bereft. Not in a bad way. Just wish this book/series could continue. It's one of those books that are sexy yet entertainging with the suspense maybe?  Don't know if that's quite the word. Things do move rather quickly in this book but trust that once you pick up 'Fifty Shades of Grey' you'll just want to get your hands on the next book. You crave to see what happens next. I highly recommend this book if you're mature and an avid reader. Just finished the last book and I'm sad that its done....for now. I have absolutely nothing to do now. Smh, the book is THAT good. Take a chance and grab hold. Fifty Shades Babe.....
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I absolutely loved this story!!  The author did a tremendous job of drawing me into the characters.  I generally get sucked into series because I LOVE character development, but this author did a great job with just a couple hundred pages.  I have already purchased the author's other books in the Kindle Store and I can't wait to read her other work.  Good Job Ms. McGuire!!
B0086700CM|5.0|amazing game. cant stop playing it. the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun. temple run should keep anyone entertained for a couple hours.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|does what it says, monitors battery level. has a few extras that don't apply to my kindle fire, but I'm sure they would be useful on a phone.
B000Z0OX9O|2.0|This is the third version I've purchased since 1988 , and I thought it would be my last . Unfortunately , disc 2 is the only part of this package worth having . If you have already bought the 1994 release , it's there again , as disc 1 . Disc 3 , IMO , is an utter cash-grab ... barely qualifies as BladeRunner material . Do yourself a favor , avoid this altogether , and scour the nets for what's called the EMS Recombination set . 4 discs , in film sequential order , alternate takes , even the Japanese ambient tracks which went largely un-noticed . Superior and unprecedented quality ! Fans out there have done what the greedy corporations could/would not , bringing the complete BladeRunner score together better than ever , and free .
B007VUA7VO|4.0|since the kindle fire doesn't tell you a percentage of your battery, I use this app. I'm sure this app has more features but for now I just use it for my battery percentage.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The more I use it, the easier it is to use. I take my kindle to church and any where when there is time to take it out my purse and just read. The different versions are a big help as well. Thanks for the app. Looking forward for more religious informative spiritual material. Donna G

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I forced myself to read this because I kept thinking, it has to get better.  It didn't.  I wanted a fun beach read.  This was a tedious, insipid book.  Don't waste you time and money.

1476712042|2.0|Marketted as a YA-friendly Fifty Shades of Grey, Beautiful Disaster is a book that people seem to either absolutely love or hate with burning passion. Its addictive, fast-paced and emotionally engaging writing style is bound to keep you captivated and entertained all the way through. However, whether you'll actually enjoy reading it or not is a whole different story. I myself came out of reading it emotionally drained, shaky, and very, very disturbed. In the end, despite its intriguing premise and great potential, this book proved to be more \\"disaster\\" and less \\"beautiful\\".<br /><br />  Make no mistake, this book is no Young Adult fiction and under no circumstances should it be categorized as such. If you're looking for a fluffy romance, or even a more profound, uplifting and meaningful love story, you should probably stir clear of it. Beautiful Disaster is a book full of adult themes and heavy social/emotional/psychological issues. It contains sexually suggestive scenes, plenty of violence and coarse language. The relationship featured within its pages is not by any means positive, and most definitely not one that people should admire, envy, or approve of. Everything about it - from the dynamics of Travis and Abby's interactions, to the way they treat other people - is downright unhealthy and dysfunctional.<br /><br />  In terms of redability this book is a winner. It's more than 400 pages long, but you could probably devour it in one sitting. The plot moves along very swiftly, the tension and excitement never lets up, and I just couldn't wait to find out how the story ends. It's a real emotional roller coaster. That's not to say that I was happy with the ending. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I kept on waiting for Abby and Travis to realize just how wrong their relationship was. I wanted Abby to understand that this really wasn't good for her (she seemed to know that, but that didn't deter her from dating Travis). Most of all, I really wanted to see some positive changes in Travis. Up until the very last page I hoped he would learn something about himself, change his ways, mature, morph into someone remotely safe and trust-worthy.. someone you could actually be with. But that never happened. As I was getting close to the end, I knew that the conclusion of the story will play a vital role in my overall rating of it. I don't mind reading about difficult, dysfunctional relationships, violence, emotional abuse, and sex - as long as it all accounts to some sort of meaningful message in the end. The only redeemable quality for this story would have been its ending, given that the characters would grow and change, or go their separate ways. Again, that didn't happen, and the ending itself left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and a sick feeling in my stomach. The only thing missing from the disastrous picture painted by the author was a knock-up and a trailer park.<br /><br />  Usually, stories such as this one have a moral, or at least they aspire to teach you a lesson. More often than not, when an author paints a very disquieting picture, it is with a purpose to educate and raise awareness. And in most of the cases there is a clear message: the events described within the pages are not meant to be perceived as positive ones. Heavy-subject-matter books are meant to inspire you to think about certain issues, analyze both the plot and the characters, reflect and learn something valuable about life. Well, that is not the case with Beautiful Disaster. As much as I would love to see a dramatic turn of events that would prove to me otherwise, this book came closer to condoning abusive behaviour that it did to educating or showing that it was wrong. Yes, I understand that the lead characters were both disturbed individuals, with difficult pasts that obviously influenced their personalities and decision-making capabilities in a bad way, but I find it all-too disturbing that their unacceptable behaviour (towards each other and other people in the story) was presented as perfectly normal, at times even cool.<br /><br />  Travis is not hot or sexy. Sure, he's good looking, strong, muscular and self-confident, but he's also jealous (borderline paranoid), controlling, possessive, irresponsible, hot-tempered, violent and emotionally abusive. On top of that, he is very needy and requires constant reassurance that he is loved and wanted. He is most definitely not swoon-worthy. Quite to the contrary, he's the type of person that you often see featured on shows like 20/20 - him being the one who lost his temper and murdered someone for a totally ridiculous reason. His idea of a relationship is just.. beyond wrong. He's not interested in partnership, he wants to own the other person. He needs to feel that Abby is his and his only, and he'll do just about anything it takes to make it happen. He tells Abby how to dress and what to do. He's so insecure that every time Abby is approached by another guy, or even looked at or spoken to, he's all rage and fists. Overprotective? Yes, but also insanely territorial and obsessive. If something doesn't go according to his plans, he's enraged and ready to destroy everything in his path. When Abby leaves his apartment without telling him, he literally goes nuts and starts breaking everything within his reach to pieces.<br /><br />  Like that wasn't enough, Travis is just an overblown version of a stereotypical bad-boy, complete with tattoos, smoking and drinking habit, motorbike and a military-cut hairstyle. Oh, and did I mention he's also promiscuous? His entire existence is made up of drinking, fighting and one-night-stands. Every night he goes drinking, comes home with a random girl, has sex with her, and then kicks her out, making it clear that she was nothing more than a way to satisfy his primitive sexual needs. Am I really supposed to believe that he will change for Abby? I guess it's not impossible, people do change, but - having read the entire book - I can honestly say that Travis is as likely to change as I am to go to Justin Bieber's concert. Because to change, one first needs to see the flaws in oneself and recognize the need for improvement. And Travis, while he often realizes his mistakes and wrongdoings, is blaming his bad behaviour on being madly in love with Abby.<br /><br />  Like I said before, it really doesn't bother me to read a book featuring violent, disturbing themes. I don't mind reading about violent/abusive characters either. I am well aware that life is not all flowers and sunshine all the time, and real-life stories, with mature-subject matter, are more than welcome on my reading list. However, when a lead character is described in a way that suggests serious psychological problems and deeply-rooted abusive tendencies, I at least expect to see his actions well-motivated, or entirely condemned in the story (whether it's by the narrator - which in this case is no one else but Abby - or by other characters in the story). More over, I also expect to see consequences of his negative behaviour. That, of course, doesn't happen. Travis is not only not criticised for the things he does (over and over again), he is in fact treated as some sort of hero, who is acting the way he is just because he's in love with Abby (and that makes it all perfectly fine). He is all-too quick to beat the living soul out of random people in the school's cafeteria for reason no other than them making a mean joke directed at his girl. What is even more disturbing, Abby herself encourages him to do so. Now, I know I'm old and it's been a long time since I went to college, but last time I checked it was not the right way to solve meaningless conflicts.<br /><br />  Despite what the blurb claims, Abby is not exactly a good girl, either. Just like Travis she's been through some difficult times in her life. Her mom is an alcoholic who can't tell winter from summer, and who doesn't care about the well-being of her offspring at all. Her dad is a famous poker player. He's addicted to gambling and would bet his own daughter without as much as a blink. Abby's life was never easy, and from the moment Travis comes into it, she knows that he's nothing but trouble. The knowledge, however, is one thing, and what we do with it is a whole different story. Abby can't seem to stay away from Travis, and after she loses a bet, she even moves in with him for an entire month. She then lets him dictate her every move and push her around however he feels like. If Travis doesn't like her clothes, Abby quickly changes. If Travis doesn't like her date, Abby ditches the poor guy without thinking twice. When Travis comes home drunk and accompanied by two random girls, and then proceeds to have sex with both of them on the couch in the living room, Abby puts a pillow over her head and patiently waits for him to be done. As much as I would like to say that Abby is just an innocent victim, though, I can't, because that would be a lie. She is manipulative, undecided, and often mean (and not only to Travis, but also to innocent bystanders), and I liked her even less than her controlling boyfriend.<br /><br />  In the end, this book had an enormous potential and could have been so much better, if only Mrs. McGuire approached it with a little bit more thought and caution. I do believe that this author has a talent for writing captivating, emotionally engaging books, though, and I am definitely looking forward to her upcoming ones. Fans of this book (and I know there are many) will be pleased to know that Beautiful Disaster will be adapted into a movie by Warner Bross, with Donald De Line (the producer of Micheal Bay's Pain and Gain) involved in the project. Additionally, rumor has it that Jamie McGuire is considering writing a sequel (or a companion-novel) from Travis' point of view. While I do not agree with the message that this book sends out to young adult and adult readers alike, I did have a good time reading it, and am certainly looking forward to its movie adaptation.can honestly say that Travis is as likely to change as I am to go to Justin Bieber's concert.

B000050XEI|5.0|Well, that's what it is ---- a replacement copy. I love music, all kinds of music EXCEPT RAP ! A couple of years ago I was driving to Las Vegas, and while out on a lonely desert highway road at 2 in the morning I heard Enya's \\"Only Time\\" over the radio. I have never done this before, but I had to know the name of that selection and who the artist was ---- so I pulled over to the side of the highway and stopped to listen to the announcer for awhile. HE NEVER DID COME BACK AND SAY WHO IT WAS OR WHAT THE TITLE WAS --- and it was driving me crazy, so I pulled over to a telephone booth and called the radio station (my cell phone didn't work out there). As soon as I reached 'Vegas, and once the stores opened, I went to a Music Dealer and bought a copy. I have played this CD so much that the CD player in my Jeep won't accept it any longer (too many small scratches from sliding it in and out of the CD sleeve on the driver's side visor). So I bought a better, more protective CD file for the car, and now I'm replacing four or five CD's that all have these little \\"storage scratches\\" on them. I can't say that I absolutely love every selection on this CD, but I have to have my Enya fix with \\"Only Time\\" on it every once in a while. Try it and you'll see what I mean.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|this is one great movie to keep you out of the water.  this is about one huge shark terrorizing and killing people.  full of action.  this is one of Steven Spielberg's first movies that he made.
B008N1LL42|5.0|I just watched Battleship. Oh wow, did I ever watch Battleship! Three times in a row to be exact,  and rewound to the most spellbinding authentic appearing and downright heart rending scenes too many times to count.<br /><br />After I invested my entire day with this BRILLIANT movie, I then went to Wikipedia to check on how it had done, etc. Well, folks, I was downright peeved. I still am! This movie did the WORST for a movie that cost what it did to produce. Are they NUTS whoever \\"they\\" are? I've had this on my wait list since I first learned of it - on the internet, by the way. Actually, via seeing a \\"drop\\" which is basically a 10 second commercial, on HULU likely, but I'm not sure. What I notice is this. I didn't see ANY other advertising for it - and wouldn't have located it had I not done my own searching for when it would be out.<br /><br />Now, with the movie industry making these massively costly boo boos for their box office, don't they get it? Don't they get the fact that most of us want to stay at home now and watch these newly released movies for MUCH less than going out to the theater and dropping a hundred bucks for all the concession nonsense as well as the cost of going? Look, film makers. We are in a real bad place here in the US financially, and yet these movies are still our outlet. Also, we who have a set income, have to limit our entertainment options - and there is much more now available via ROKU and the net. Heck, I haven't had cable for years since I found HULU. It rocks to have the option of watching what I want, when I want to watch it. Also, all the networks have gotten it apparently - because I can also watch CSI or whatever - and when I wish, via their website. Who, in the world, doesn't know this now? I don't know anyone.<br /><br />Back to BATTLESHIP! My point is simple. This movie is exceptional, as is another movie by the star, Taylor Kitsch who appears in this one - John Carter the movie. It didn't do well at all either - and I just happened on it. On Amazon, of course, and you should buy it too! You won't be sorry. So, all you who are making the mistake of paying any attention to other than what folks are sharing in this forum? Get over it and WATCH THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE! BUY BATTLESHIP, pop some popcorn, get some Kit-Kats at Walmart and have fun! Be prepared to be proud of the USA. We are the greatest country on this earth...well, the best of the worst anyway! Anyway, Battleship is absolutely worth it. Now, I think I'm going to watch it again!! Be well, all of you.t happened on it. On Amazon, of course, and you should buy it too! You won't be sorry. So, all you who are making the mistake of paying any attention to other than what folks are sharing in this forum? Get over it and WATCH THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE!

0385742886|4.0|I thought this prequel was pretty good. Nice writing, as usual. The new characters had good development, good plot, and i liked getting a peak at Teresa and Thomas pre maze. I also liked getting in the head of the government and what led up to the maze. It was boring at times, I loved the 1st half of the book and the ending. But a chunk towards the end wasnt needed. The boring was also pulling me out of the emotion towards the characters. Good book though. Worth reading.<br /><br />BTW>>>>>>> I recommend reading the prequel last if you havent read any of them yet.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but after reading some reviews before I downloaded this album I feel the need to write one.  I think this is an outstanding album.  I usually need to hear an album a few times before I really appreciate it and this one took me two listens to realize how outstanding it is.<br /><br />Let me start by saying this is a band that REALLY needs to be in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame!!  The music is excellent as usual.  Getty, Alex and Neil have not lost a thing with their music.  They are among the best musicians at their craft.  I really enjoy the music on this album more than the previous two efforts.  It is different but that is what all Rush fans have come to appreciate with this band.  Some of my favorite music pieces are The Anarchist, Caravan, Clockwork Angels and Carnies.  They have a good drive and beat.  The Wreckers is a bit more of a medley but I really like it.  I have read some reviews that really did not like the lyrics.  Let me say that I don't think they are on par with Red Barchetta or Spirit of Radio but that is not what this album is about.  I think Neil is showing his songwriting diversity.  And let's face it classic songs are really hard to top and aren't produced every day.  I think the lyrics are very good but not outstanding.  In all I find this album a very good listen and for the past week I have listened to it every night when I get home from work and on my way home.  I think all Rush fans can appreciate this album.
0765316994|2.0|I love all the John Scalzi books but this one. I tried, but I just didn't care for it. Surprising as I love Star Trek and John Scalzi novels and thought it to be a perfect fit, but I just could not get into the humor (or irony?) of it. Just my opinion.
B007I9JGSS|5.0|I become more of a fan of Anoushka with each release.<br /><br />Even though I happen to like \\"Breathing Under Water\\" better, nevertheless this is still a 5 star release. I like the fact that this is something very different and I like the fact that Anoushka is pushing the envelope, using the sitar in new and unique musical expressions.<br /><br />Who knew that Flamenco music originated in India? I did not. But blending Spanish and Indian music as she has done here makes for a very nice musical outing.<br /><br />I look forward to Anoushka's next surprise!

0307594165|5.0|The first chapter of this book may be the best fiction I have ever read.  I actually had to stop after I'd read it and just calm down a bit.  You can read the first chapter here on Amazon.  Do that and you will want to read the book.  Ms. Morrison writes so beautifully.  Great book.  I will read it again.
0345803485|1.0|Well, what can I say. I dragged myself through Books 1 and 2 hoping it would improve. There was a glimmer of hope in Book 3 while I waited for the resolution of the Hyde incident, but alas and alack, no joy. I couldn't finish Book 3. I was BORED!!!!!!! Ms. James, please don't bother to write another book. And to your editors, this was NOT erotica. This was NOT a romance. This was a waste of trees.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I enjoyed this a lot more then the first book, but that's understandable as it is a much fleshier story and really allows you to get to know these two people who have been through so much together. The writing allowed me to feel thoroughly engaged in their conversations and you really feel everything that Adam does, and you really feel for him.<br /><br />You don't Need to read the first book to get this one but it does help in understanding Mia and the choice she made and the love Adam had for her.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I'm not a fan of ballroom dancing but I am a fan of good movies and this one certainly qualifies. A story told with so much affection and humor your start smiling right from the start and don't stop till the rousing finale. By the time this movie was over, I was looking for a dance partner.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've read through this book several times and I KNOW I will read it again. It's that gripping, intense, emotional, funny and exciting. I loved how the relationship progressed between the two main characters, it wasn't rushed or too slow and the writing was just ridiculously good. You felt everything they felt. When they were happy so were you and when they hurt you were hurting right along with them. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is now and will always be one of my all time favorites

While they were watching the movie my husband, in another room, heard the coach say \\"What the h--- are you doing?\\" or something close to that...the point is, this is a movie with looney toon characters. LOONEY TOONS...thought this would be a safe choice. I know this is considered mild, but 5-year olds repeat so much of what they hear. The boys will probably watch it again and we will explain the poor choice of language but it's too bad the movie industry chooses to include language inappropriate for chlldren.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|well its a cute little game...theres not really much  u can buy with the money u get unless u actually buy more coins which costs REAL money. so unless you dont mind spending real money for a GAME then this might not be your cup of tea.but its still fun and very much based off the movie! plus you do get ur own on here but it justs takes a while to build up ur village without buying more village coins for the store.

B007L96VCY|4.0|McCartney is a favorite of mine but he certainly started slowly on his own.  \\"McCartney\\" was mostly filler around 'Maybe I'm Amazed' & this second album is inconsistant.  There are great songs like 'Uncle Albert' & 'Smile Away' (which should have been all over the radio).  There are good songs like 'Heart of the Country' & 'Too Many People', & there are also really bad songs like (both) 'Ram'(s) & '3 Legs'.  There are also songs that are almost good like 'Eat at Home' & 'Monkberry Moon Delight'.<br /><br />The special edition includes several extra songs including the great 'Another Day' and the seldom heard goodies 'Oh Woman Oh Why' & 'Little Woman Love' (both really good former B-sides).  It also has a few songs I'd never heard and mostly they were very good - 'Hey Diddle' & 'Love For You' especially.  He should have put these songs on the disc originally & left off someof the crap.<br /><br />I think the extra songs make the special edition the way to buy this disc if you are thinking about it at all.  Not a good album originally the extra make it a lot more enjoyable.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This is another great product from Sony. I have a Sony Win7, and you would think it would be easy to install.  Not quite.  You need to play around with \\"Manage Audio Devices\\" to play through your pc.  Once the setup is good and you can hear the record player, it's time for the software. Once you played around with it (high learning curve), it records GREAT.  I have recorded 40+ yr old records...And the software removes the scratches and pops. This is amazing! New life to old LPs!
B000007MVU|3.0|I have a lot of Ringo's albums.  Ringo might be the most underrated & under appreciated artist in music.  I'm sure he sells plenty of albums but he seldom gets on the radio and you never hear much about him.  But his stuff is almost always really good and he always has a revolving cast of the world's greatest musicians backing him.<br /><br />\\"Sentimental Journey\\" is his first effort & nothing here was in much danger of getting radio play.  But several songs are very good, especially 'The Whispering Grass'. 'Stardust' & 'I'm A Fool To Care' are also quite good.  Interestingly, 'Night & Day' is essentially a Beatles song since it was done by Ringo, McCartney, & Geargoe Martin at Abbey Road studio during the \\"Abbey Road\\" sessions.  It is o.k. but not special at all.  There are also several fails.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying this knowing what I know now, but the above mentioned songs are very worth buying themselves.

Instead its about the writing and the way the book hooked me..I couldn't wait to see what would happen next and see if the person who was responsible for the crime was caught.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for someone who wants a light murder/mystery feel with a lot of tension and wondering what is going to happen!!<br /><br />GOOD BOOK!!!
B0000041WV|5.0|Just want to add my 5-stars to the discussion. These are great and beautifully played renditions. Are they perfect? Maybe not, but I don't look for perfection, just honesty, committment, sincerity, and a sense that the artists involved are trying to show these works in a way that is individual and interesting. That is all here in spades. As for the sound, I think it's a very good analog sound; that is to say, glare in the treble, not very strong in the bass frequencies with amazing detail and impact. Just like most LPs sounded like then. Personally, I think it's wonderful. So, put the bass up and enjoy! The packaging is a drawback, but I don't delete stars for that.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Neal Stephenson caught my attention with [[ASIN:0061694940 Anathem]], and when I found Cryptonomicon on a \\"10 Science Fiction Novels You Pretend to Have Read (And Why You Should Actually Read Them\\" list, I was ready to dive in. So far it's been amazing, it is a tome of a book but well worth every page.
B007SGM084|3.0|I believe that if I did not read them I would not have  missed much.  I did not feel that they were well written.  I don't really enjoy these kind of books.  All my (girl) friends said I had to read them.  I did.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I'm a fan of all of their albums. Each one is unique, and shows a different period of music for the band.<br /><br />This one shows a period of anger. Maria and Chris went into the studio after some band-related issues and pumped out some music that reflected their feelings. What came from it seems to be either loved or hated by the listeners. I think this is a natural step forward from \\"A Star-Crossed Wasteland\\" sound-wise. It carries on the good melodies, while Maria continues to mix-up the singing and screaming like she did the previous album. There is more screaming here than in \\"A Star-Crossed Wasteland,\\" but that only seems natural when you look into what was going on right before they dove into this album.<br /><br />The samples hardly do the songs justice, and it's worth checking out the entire album!<br /><br />Recommended songs are: \\"Blood,\\" \\"Adrenalize,\\" \\"Whore,\\" \\"Burn,\\" \\"Scarlet,\\" and \\"Comanche.\\"

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I will pre-order this movie. Whats nice about Amazon is if it is the same as the Panasonic release you can just return itif you have prime. I have the Panasonic 3D version. Paid 80 bucks for it. Well worth it. Best movie for 3D that I own. There isn't a person that doesn't finish the movie when we sit down to \\"show off\\" the 3D picture. I have the Sharp Aquos LC-70LE735U 70-inch That extra yelllow pixel makes this TV. The glasses for this tv have also gone down to $40 also. Don't get anything smaller than a 70\\", if the 80\\" would have been 3D last year when I bought the 70\\" I would have gotten the 80\\" one.
0345803493|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever attempted to read!  I should have learned my lesson after reading the first novel in the trilogy!  How is this book a best seller?  Maybe if you never read a book before in your life you might think it is good.  The first book has somewhat of a plot, but the second one has no plot whatsoever.  It is just page after page of boring blah blah blah, sex, blah, blah, sex, rinse, repeat...I found myself skipping pages just to finish...since I spent my money on this piece of garbage after all.  Please do not waste your money on these books!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book so much! It was a good mix of action drama and romance. I enjoyed it alot because it was so thrilling!You could never guess what was to happen next. I cried many times throughout the book.I highly recomend this book!The only thing I can say upset me was that when I  got to the end I found myself craving more!!!This is a must read!  GO TEAM PEETA!!!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It's very rare these days to find an action movie or a comedy that has any thought behind it at all.  RED is brilliantly written.  So many movies are written for what I consider to be the \\"dumb\\" general public... very slapstick, typical, predictable humor.  This movie was entertaining without being predictable in any way.  The actors were fantastic in their delivery, and made for a genuinely funny action comedy.  John Malcovich makes the movie.  He is proof that most of the \\"funny\\" in comedy comes from the delivery of simple lines.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Worth every minute!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|It took a great effort to procure this game. It was mentioned on \\"NCIS Los Angeles\\" so I assumed it would be great. This is the lamest game I've ever played...no instructions...no controls that do anything. A total waste of money.

0345803485|1.0|I can't believe I have not wrote a review for this yet. All I can say about the book and the hype surrounding it is... \\"So what.\\" I was actually watching the Today show the day I got my Kindle in the mail and on that episode Hoda was raving about 50 Shades of Grey. Around that time was when this book was really becoming big. I finally wanted to read a book that everyone was reading because I thought it would be fun to get into something like that.  There was so much surrounding this book and people made it seem like the type of book that I would be interested in reading. Nope, not so much.<br /><br />While reading the book I kept wondering to myself \\"Why are grown women reading this and getting so excited? It seems like a book that was wrote for young teenagers.\\" Honestly the writing of the book is that for a young girl. And the hype surrounding it!? ...He's into whips and chains. So what! This book (Like The Hunger Games) is very juvenile.  Yes the main character is a virgin but she's in her twenties and when reading from her point of view it feels as if you're reading from a 13 year old child's mind.<br /><br />I'm the type of person that once I start a book, I have to finish. Oh what a struggle it was for me to finish this very boring book about an immature girl and a man that is into kinky sex.<br /><br />It's not a very bad book, it was just very lame. No big deal.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I just got this product in the mail today and its great i have tested it out for 2 hrs on MW3 and there is no dead zones what so ever and is a great feel in your hand. The only bad thing is that it took me some while to get used to it xD
0439023521|1.0|Yet another book that I decided to read because of the Hype surrounding it. Really people!? Really?!<br /><br />I cannot believe the hype surrounding this book.  It was very predictable I honestly knew everything that was going to happen. Anytime something went wrong, bam! There was something to fix it. Everything, just like that, fell into place.<br /><br />I will say that if I were a 9 year old child I would probably give this book a 4 star review but being 22 this book was such an easy read and makes me wonder why there are adults acting like it was such a good book. It has a Twilight feel to it.<br /><br />I'm not writing a deep review on this book and I won't be reading the rest.
0345803485|5.0|It is a great read.  And you want to go on to the next book in the Trilogy.  So, go ahead and by the trilogy if you can as you will want to read on.

B006M9NJFG|4.0|Good item, costs too much normally and could be even better quality and material but still good buy without regrets
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I started listing to this CD through my son who is constantly playing it on his I-phone and in the car.  I love all the songs and some of them (music and voice and wise) give me a sort of Stevie Wonder vibe. It's so wonderful to finally pay for a CD that is good from beginning to the end; you can just kick back a listen to it any time. For those of you looking for a really great CD to listen to this would be it.<br /><br />One more thing I know there has been a lot of talk regarding this young musician's lifestyle and why some may be hesitant to listen to or buy the CD.  What I have to say about that is I doesn't matter how he chooses to live, Frank Ocean is so very talented and this CD deserves a standing ovation.
0345803485|3.0|Ok, for the most part, it did keep me reading. I was intrigued and wanted to know what happened next. But seriously? Come on! This book is not realistic at all! I borrowed this from a friend. Thank goodness!! Here are my main issues with the writing: The author apparently does not have a clue how a 21 year old speaks. She says like, \\"He's a lovely man.\\" \\"I am acting like a wanton.\\" \\"How do you do?\\" and my personal fav. the use of the word, foul. Who in the 21st century speaks like this? Let alone a 21 year old college student. Also, she says she's shy, but a shy person does not ask a complete powerful, stranger if he is gay. I have yet to understand why Mr. Grey likes Ana so much. All I've noticed while reading is that she has a smart mouth and rolls her eyes a lot. The author never gives any description of Ana's appearance, but Grey is apparently perfect looking. Grey is a psycho though! She's scared to be around him half the time. This was voted best romance? So hitting a woman is ok? I don't care if it \\"turns you on!\\" Why does everyone like this book so much? It scares me that it's so popular. This is what good literature is these days? The sad thing is the author mentions some great classic literature in this book. Too bad she didn't learn a thing or twenty.
0375851569|5.0|With a new grandchild's arrival I had to get the early Dr. Seuss books to start his collection.  No one can beat these beginning readers!  I'll be reading to this child immediately, he'll be raised on Dr. Seuss as was his father.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a good way to uwind and use your brain. I like &quot;cypherin on tough things&quot;. I feel thing double ott seven.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Honestly, at first I thought it was a copy of Twilight. The setting of Washington, the innocent girl and the dangerous, not good for you, mysterious boy. The attraction to each other despite their differences, and the way he is serious and overprotective like Edward. The main difference I thought was that this one actually allowed them to have sex. Then once you get into the book a little more, you see the depth to it. Eventhough it read like Twilight in the beginning, I couldn't put it down because I kept thinking, \\"there's gotta be something more to this\\". There was a bit of that, like the bits of Christian's background you get fed, and his past, but mostly it came at the end by leaving you hanging after they break up. I did enjoy the book. The author has a good sense of humor and can get into the thought process of Ana so you feel like you are thinking the same thing she is. I like that she shows the struggle between what you think you know you should do with her conscience, and the do what you like and do it whenever you like \\"inner goddess\\". I think the second and third book are a little better becuase you get more of a story around the sex,but the first one is needed to introduce the characters. I do like the adult situations in here and makes their relationship seem more realistic because they actually do get together.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|there are apps that are horrible versions of this that want you to shell out cash. get this. I have tried other ones. it was one that was the faotd like 2 months ago and everyone gave it bad ratings. this right here is simple and to the point an alarm clock dude. you can set heckuv em and choose from a whole bunch of music to play when the alarm goes off. cop it.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|I have not seen the Blu-Ray yet, but I did catch this one at the movies. I can honestly say it was one of the worst along with \\"Promethieus\\" movie I have seen in ages. It was supposed to be about games, but very little of the actual games are evident. Just a very bad movie in every department; screenplay, director, acting, editing, music. Wow did it stink!!

B00004SYWZ|4.0|Gets into some of the old A-Ha stuff we all liked back in the day... 80's  I like it, had to hunt for it, but totally worth it.
0345803485|5.0|I know the controversy is as hot and heavy as the book, but honestly, lets just put it out there the book is HOT.  James knows how to build sexual tension and characters that appeal.  I loved the humor of the email exchanges, the amazing sex, and both of the characters quirks. I found myself thoroughly engrossed and more than a bit turned on. Really, read this book in private. LOL<br /><br />Seriously, I caught a few of the grammar mistakes and it is too bad those were not corrected, but it wasn't too bad and never pulled me out of the story.  Ana's low self-esteem does get a bit much at times, but lets face it, the book is super popular for a reason.  Somewhere inside of us a lot of us really want to be shamefully seduced by a rich billionaire that we don't feel worthy of.  For now I would settle for that first elevator kiss.  There is something about elevators.  Now, I am off to bury myself under the covers and read the sequel.

B000AYQNYI|3.0|Bon Jovi are like the first car you got lucky in; Every time you see one in an old TV rerun you smile and your mind drifts away for a minute, but more for what was happening around them than by how amazing they actually were...That's really not that bad of a dig-80's Pop Metal was more about commercializing the the Sunset Strip Scene for MTV than any attempt at making a musical statement, and Slippery When Wet is one of the best content filled examples of commercial rock of the period. Compare how big these guys were in their day to modern \\"music hit makers\\" and any disdain you may have for Bon Jovi seems horribly misplaced, duddin' it? In this case I think I'd rather be so good at it some people hate me for it, than be so bad at it no one knows me from it, but I digress...<br /><br />Since you could also argue more people bought this record than have ever heard of Becker and Fagen, maybe mentioning the sound and presentation of the remaster and Surround Mixes of the Dual Disc here could help the cause of improved re-release techniques for all music. No this isn't the sonic equivelant of the Gaucho or Avalon SACD's, but I was surprised that a) yes I too had a regular CD of this in my collection to compare it to (!), and b) there was a very noticable improvement in the quality of the stereo mix. The Surround Mix was VERY well done, in that there's no gymnastic panning tricks to what would be almost expected in an 80's Metal record redux. Everything that needs to stay in a place does, and the surrounds do open up synth pads, percussion, and the occasional layered guitar in a very satisfying way. In sonics, a very respectful treatment to the material.<br /><br />I do however take great pause to altering the original track's content-Several of the tracks are extended, or have alternate intros, etc. Even if this is/was \\"just\\" 80's pop music, if you're going to go to the efforts to re-release the masterpiece experience, then re-release it in the original version as people remember, THEN add \\"alternate version\\" tracks, demos, extras, etc. There's plenty of space on the disc...If this were done to a Rush or Queen Classic-Changing (and thus replacing) the original versions of songs (even slightly) from what will most likely be the best sounding presentations you'll find in your lifetimes, there would be rioting in the streets and blogs...ok maybe just the blogs, but again-there's a big difference between clearing up historical records and altering the \\"facts\\". With all due respect to Bon Jovi fans, as fans you deserve better and it doesn't look like you get it. I hope I'm wrong...What's next, an altered version of \\"Back in Black\\" with drum solos?? For me as a casual fan of Bon Jovi music, I applaud the sonic efforts even if I have philosophical differeces with the presentation.  3-stars.remember, THEN add \\"alternate version\\" tracks, demos, extras, etc. There's plenty of space on the disc...If this were done to a Rush or Queen Classic-Changing (and thus replacing) the original versions of songs (even slightly) from what will most likely be the best sounding presentations you'll find in your lifetimes, there would be rioting in the streets and blogs...ok maybe just the blogs, but again-there's a big difference between clearing up historical records and altering the \\"facts\\".

B007IXWL2C|5.0|There are 1291 books in my Kindle library and this is only the 3rd or 4th on which I feel compelled to comment. It is so easy to criticize an authors work but, really, I don't care if it's poorly written as long as it grabs my imagination and never lets go. She's a new author, producing her first works! So what if Anastasia seems wimpy and weak. She's a college kid (and a virgin to boot) bowled over by a billionaire pervert. I love these characters and the way Ms. James develops them. This is not great literature but it is great reading and I will never forget Christian and Anastasia and their beautiful love story. Ms James, Thank you. You keep writing and I'll keep reading.
B008DVJO8C|1.0|Being a huge fan of In This Moment's last effort, A Star-Crossed Wasteland, I waited with eager anticipation for Blood.  Even though the title single's chorus reminded me of heavy cover of Toni Basil's Hey Mickey, I quickly dismissed this as their attempt to make a more radio friendly song.  I never fault bands for trying to appeal to wider audiences as long as their musical integrity remains intact.  Sadly, this is not the case with ITM's newest release.<br /><br />With every successive track my distaste grew.  At first I was intrigued by Maria Brink's lyrics, they are much darker and filled with hurt and negativity.  However, they soon became whiny and left the impression that she was attempting to be edgy.  Instead of being an exploration of deep personal insecurities the lyrics come off as sordid and contrived.  I quickly realized I wasn't listening to the ITM that I've enjoyed since Beautiful Tragedy but a clone of Halestorm, which by my standards would be the same as if Lamb of God emulated Nickelback.<br /><br />I'll be honest; lyrically, ITM has had their share of hiccups but they always managed to make up for the triteness with highly impressive musicality.  Brink's vocals, Blood included, have always been top notch.  She definitely has a gift and is just as comfortable screaming with rage as she is singing with melody and emotion (i.e. World in Flames). But for some reason, her conveyance of said rage and emotion on Blood is completely absent.  And speaking of absent, what happened to Chris Howorth?  As a guitarist myself, I loved Howorth's style and tone.  Although not overly complex, he was still able to shred while keeping his solos tasteful and complimentary to the song environment.  In fact, the main reason I rushed out to buy the new album was to see what he had in store.  My high expectations inevitably lead to my biggest disappointment with Blood.  There are absolutely NO guitar solos worthy of Chris Howorth.  There were a few moments where I actually thought he would deliver but the opportunities were squandered.  He might have 3 or 4 solos on the whole album, all of them weak and amateurish at best.  I know that not all solos have to be face-melters but it's as if he didn't even try.  Even his rhythms were bland and uninspired.  I went so far as to check to make sure he was still involved with band and wasn't replaced by a session guitarist.  Without musicianship to salvage the wreckage, as soon as track 14 ended, I promptly ejected the disc from my CD player (rarely do I not give an album a second listen, especially when it's a new purchase), withheld my urge to crack it in half, and placed it in the case where it will remain.  I'm not even ripping it to iTunes for fear it will somehow reappear on my shuffle.<br /><br />I hate so much that my first review on Amazon is so negative.  What's worse is that I am so fond of In This Moment.  While the talent is definitely present, Blood is a far cry from the band's capabilities.  Brink and Howorth should be ashamed of their laziness and will hopefully grow out of this 2002 nu-metal throwback phase in time for their next album.
1590200918|4.0|On a freezing January night Oliver visits his old tutor Theo in Cambridge. Seated near a briskly burning fire with drinks within reach, the old bachelor, who has lived there for over 50 years, prepares to tell Oliver the story of the late 18th-century painting that hangs almost invisible between two bookcases. Oliver walks over and is instantly enthralled.<br />Young Theo was a keen buyer and seller of old drawings and paintings at auctions. This piece is a detailed crowd scene of carnival in Venice, &agrave; la Breughel or Hieronymus Bosch with lots of things going on at once. After the auction, Theo was accosted by an excited man commissioned to buy the work, who arrived late; he wants to buy it from Theo at any price. Theo had been mysteriously drawn to it during viewing hours and the incident fortified his resolve: he will not sell it, never, ever.<br />Susan Hill (SH) describes the painting from the perspective of four main characters. Some report having detected whiffs of newly-dried paint, and/or have seen the terrified faces of recently, suddenly passed-away loved ones trapped in the painting. The four accounts are an incomplete history of how the painting may have blighted the lives of many generations of owners. The oldest reference is of its having been a wedding present from a young lady who hoped to be the bride herself...<br />I am no expert of this genre. SH is a gifted plotter and good on atmosphere in Cambridge and North Yorkshire and Venice is described as dangerous. The novella is timeless, but a chance mention of a mobile phone reveals it occurred yesterday. There are other issues. One smart reader wrote that it reads like a first draft with many loose ends. He/she is right. Some scenes are Gothic page-fillers going nowhere. Oliver's future wife is introduced much too late in the book. And why does Theo, aware of the painting's evil past, bequeath it to Oliver? Neither Oliver nor Theo see the end of the story. Ideal for reading groups and to reread solo.Neither Oliver nor Theo see the end of the story. Ideal for reading groups and to reread solo.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this book with great excitement. Please don't read any more of this review if you are going to read the book.  The main character was sleazy, missing woman was sleazy, but the turns and twist were good.  The villain was to smart for my liking and the book didn't seem to end, just kinda faded away.  Too many \\"oh yeah by the way the villain had prepared for that\\" to be creditable.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|This book was NOT funny at all.  I read other reviews and was eager to get it to read on a long trip.  All I can say is I must not have the same sense of humor as others.  This book just wasn't what I consider a \\"good read\\"
034580404X|5.0|LOVE these books. All 3 are awesome and leave u wanting more! I'll probably read them all again. Makes ne so ready for the movie to come out. The language is pretty bad, but other than that they're really good!

B0087DFIYA|4.0|I wasn't expecting much and was prepared to fast-forward through the video, but found myself kicking back and thoroughly enjoying \\"Get the Gringo.\\" It's not easy (and actually risky) to attempt mixing comedy, action, and drama in a film, yet the writers (including Gibson), actors, and director pulled it off here. I agree with others that Mel is at the top of his game in this one, and his co-stars, Kevin Hernandez (as the boy) and Dolores Heredia (as the mom) shine as well. My favorite scene involves Mel...nah, I'm not going to spoil it. :)
030758836X|4.0|4.5 Stars.<br />I don't read many thrillers but this was one of those books that all my friends had read and kept asking me about so I decided to give it a go.  The first half of the book is outstanding...maybe even too outstanding because the second half (as things come crashing to a conclusion) doesn't quite live up to the setup.  So yeah, I can understand why some readers don't like the ending.  That said, never once was I tempted to put down this book.  Overall, Flynn is a brilliant writer and a master of character voices.  Even if you're not a die-hard fan of the genre, Gone Girl is well worth reading.

0439023513|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read! (And I have read: Harry Potter, 50 Shades, Twilight, and countless others.) I do not want this series to end! I am glad I enjoyed the movies, so that I can at least get another Hunger Games fix, every time the new movies come out.  Then I will have to re-read the series I think.  This book has so many emotions, from hope to despair, and everything in between. I was expecting the epilogue as much as I thought it would be completely different. I know that doesn't make much sense, but SPOILER ALERT<br />SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Katniss ends up with Peeta (which I expected) and lives a kind of happily ever after (which I did not expect).  I am glad that Panem didn't end up a fairy tale, magic, happy place, because I think it would have taken away from the believability of the entire series. (I could totally see our government acting like this in the future.) I like the way Ms. Collins portrayed Katniss and Peeta kind of broken and trying to figure out how to live, after surviving 2 Hunger Games, and the war against the capital. And am I the only one that was stoked Katniss killed Coin?<br />VERDICT<br /><br />Read the series. Go. Now. Read!<br />see more of my reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com

0439023491|5.0|Wow!  I loved the Hunger Games and gave it a 5 star review.  This book was just as entertaining, and shocking as Book 1.  This book starts at the end of Book 1.  Katniss is the image of the rebellion, because of what happened when she was in the Hunger Games, and her attempt to save herself and Peeta.  If you loved the Hunger Games, you won't be disappointed with this installment in the series.  The characters are descripted so beautifully, you can't help feeling for them throughout the book.  You gasp when they are injured, swoon when they kiss, and mourn when they die.  I want to say so much, but don't want to spoil it for you.  This book was more shocking than book 1, due to the Quarter Quell, and unrest in the Districts. ARGH! READ THIS NOW. see more of my reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com

B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Guy lying on the ground. The ball bouncing up is everything he see as a soul of a person who has committed suicide. He tells his honey about how everything was good that went bad but how we will recover from it. Hes in so much trouble. He takes a walk.  The wife the children never understand but all the weight of others he employed looking at him as a loser is too much. He has a great life insurance policy he leaves them what he can. Passion Pit puts this into words and song. That's Genius.  This is a number 1 song for intelligent people. If your not intelligent don't listen to it. That's the answer.
B006PGL7OQ|1.0|This Sony blu-ray release has an audio track that is infected with cinavia corruption.  Send Sony a message that corrupted lossless audio tracks are unacceptable.  Do not purchase this.
B008MEM24S|3.0|Like I mean I love a lot of the games and I just smile if they aren't good but I don't like Phineas and Ferb. and find it annoying but its a cute idea and don't have anything against the creators cuz its better than what I could do I just wouldn't and don't play the game often. and people who disagree have their oppini<br />on and that's fair
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This is an excellent read.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  I was very pleased with as well as th eother books in this series.  i'm yearning for more.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|THIS COULD BE ANTHRAX'S BEST ALBUM THAT THEY HAVE EVER DONE AND COULD EASILY BE METAL ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!! THE MUSIC AND THE RETURN OF BELLADONNA ON VOCAL'S IS AMAZING TO SAY THE LEAST, AND HIS VOICE IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN HE SOUNDED 20 YEARS AGO! I DON'T BELIEVE JOHN BUSH (EVEN THOUGH HE DID WELL WITH ANTHRAX) OR ANY OTHER SINGER WOULD HAVE MADE THIS ALBUM SOUND AS GOOD AS IT DOES VOCALLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE CLASSIC ANTHRAX AGAIN! I VERY RARELY GIVE ANYTHING 5 STARS, BUT I BELIEVE THIS ALBUM DESERVES IT. FOR A COMEBACK ALBUM RETURNING TO FORM AND REUNITING WITH JOEY B. MAKES THIS A SPECIAL KICK ASS ALBUM THAT MANY OF US LONG TIME FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR, THANKS ANTHRAX FOR MAKING A DREAM COME TRUE FOR MANY OF US AND GO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!
0718157834|5.0|I was really skeptical about reading this book. I thought it would be hard to get into and difficult to read and a bit cliche, it wasn't, such an easy read and you get sucked in almost right away. The story is so touching and you feel like you're there watching the events that occur and you want to reach out and help too. JoJo Moyes shows great passion in this book, it's the first book I have read of hers and it was so worth it. As much as it's a sad ending, it feels so real, as if you knew the characters and you want the best to happen. Definitely buy this book, any bad reviews are just rubbish, I was recommended this book by family and I don't even enjoy reading until I read this book....
B006UG90RM|5.0|IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE 14 OR 54 THIS IS \\"ROCK N' ROLL!\\" AND THAT IS ALL THAT MATTER'S! I TOLD MYSELF A LONG TIME AGO THAT I WOULD NOT DISCUSS IN GREAT DETAIL ABOUT MY TOP 6 OR SEVEN FAVORITE BANDS IN GENERAL OR GIVE MY OPINION ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE MY FAVORITE! AND I FEEL THAT I MAY OVER EXAGGERATE OR TALK TO FAST, BUT IN THIS CASE LIKE I WAS SAYING BEFORE; IF YOU LIKE ROCK N' ROLL, HARD ROCK, OR WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO CALL IT...... THIS IS VAN HALEN AND \\"VAN HALEN RULES!!!\\" AND SO DOES THIS AWESOME MATERIAL, WELL CONSTRUCTED AND WELL PLAYED FROM OUR \\"GOD FATHERS OF ROCK!\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First I'd like to say that I'm very picky when it comes to new authors, and I am just getting into this new \\"Indie\\" world of fiction, which until now has proven, shall I say, lacking.  I usually decide whether or not I buy a book based on the reviews from other people, and have been tricked a few times, mostly into books that I couldn't finish, not for lack of trying.  To each his own.<br /><br />Buying \\"Wool\\" has turned into one of the most rewarding books I've read in a long time.  I am a huge David Weber, Peter F. Hamilton fan, and while this book doesn't have the grand scale of most of their books, I felt more engaged and entertained by \\"Wool\\".  I could literally feel the tension rising throughout the stories, and said to myself several times \\"I wish I could read faster, I need to know what happens!\\"<br /><br />While I don't watch a lot of TV, I was a big fan of \\"Lost\\"...that is until the last season.  The few  first few seasons, after every episode, I would literally be on the edge of my seat yelling...\\"WHAAAT?!  No way!\\"  That's how I felt reading this story, every chapter MADE me want to read the next.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever been so engaged about a book series as I am with \\"Wool\\"!  Thank you Hugh Howey for writing such a great work.  Can't wait for more!!!!
B007RKPO84|4.0|THIS ALBUM BY KREATOR FLAT OUT ROCKS!! WELL PRODUCED, WRITTEN AND ARRANGED THIS ALBUM HAS AN OLD/NEW SOUND LIKE ENEMY OF GOD MEETS COMA OF SOULS.

B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this app so much! the only thing that bugs me is that in the dance of the sugar plum fairy,  you have to use three keys at one time but they can only calculate two at the same time. anyways beside that this app is wonderful. I'm thinking of getting the full version

B006LSZECO|4.0|Would have found this easier to read in print because of the way the chapters are set up.  I wanted to go back to check the table of contents frequently.  It was a little slow getting into it.  I didn't find the characters particularly appealing.  A friend told me she couldn't put the book down, and I was not feeling that way.  But about half-way through, I found out what she meant, and I finished the book the next day.  Quite the amazing story.  I don't think I have read anything quite like it.  Left me a little breathless.
B007Y36K46|3.0|John Carter is a great synopsis of the book. I think the acting could have been a little better; there were moments in the movie when the lines and presentation were great, in others just filling air, hence my 3 star rating.  I'd like to see a sequel which this alludes to.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a nice ap, esp for being free.  I like that I can choose the sounds I like and have them play together, and that I can control the volume of each.  And there is the potential to create background beats for creating deeper states of consciousness w headphones.<br /><br /> I use it at night to have background noise to help me go to sleep which is very nice.<br /><br />Like other people have said it would be nice if this background generator would play while I am doing something else on the tablet.<br /><br />So all in all. I am very happy and grateful.  Thank you for creating this nice ap and generously sharing it.  I hope it makes you rich!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I liked this movie even though the camera was on constant tilt. I  bought a new copy because my other one was lost at a relatives house. But, it's cool-they are reimbursing me! Would like to see \\"CLOVERFIELD TWO\\". Just hope the find someone who can hold a camera straight!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I expected an outstanding performance by a Star, cast as an historical politician.<br />The film shows the kaleidoscopic flashbacks of a senile old woman, that made few connections with one of Great Britons finest Prime Ministers.<br />If you want to view \\"The Iron Lady,\\" Margaret Thatcher, I suggest you review old news clips and pass on this tripe.<br />I hope that Ms. Streep reads the screenplays of her future endeavors more closely before committing to play the character.<br />This is a very boring movie that I painfully watched, hoping the next scene would be better.<br />I was very disappointed, because I expected more from a great actress.
B007SGM084|4.0|This Is a good story. It has extremely graphic sex scenes so it would be rated pg-13. I enjoyed reading it.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Beatles For Sale is kind of the demarcation point for the Beatles career.  Lennon and McCartney are coming into their own as writers and taking chances with themes that are not just cute love songs, a bit moody (consider: I'm a Loser, No Reply, Baby's in Black, I'll Follow the Sun, What You're Doing, I Don't Want to Spoil the Party).<br /><br />Yet we still have six songs that are standards, typical of the era.  \\"Help\\" that followed only had two covers and thereafter it was all Beatles compositions.  Even so, The Beatles always gave great renditions of their covers - John Lennon is terrific on Rock and Roll Music, as is McCartney on Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey, George on Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby, and Ringo on Honey Don't.  These guys really respected the artists that influenced them and wanted to show it.  Mr. Moonlight, however, is one of the worst songs ever.<br /><br />BFS is the first album I ever owned and as result it has sentimental value for me.  My mom bought it for me in France and it was called \\"Beatles 65\\".  I love this album even though critically it may not stand up to others that followed.  These songs, and maybe the seven songs from the movie Help, are the last of the fun, Beatlemania times.
B00571F26Y|5.0|this book totally opened my eyes to the horrors that is wheat. i got both of my parents to read it and they both removed wheat from their diet as well. this book shows every aspect of why wheat is bad for your mind and overall health. it is not just about weight loss it explains why it will be a healthier life.
B007ZZKWHY|5.0|So far there have been FOUR truly great movies of the year; Cabin in the Woods, Iron Sky, The Raid and The Avengers. But this post is dedicated to the one getting the least amount of attention. Iron Sky is BRILLIANT! Imagine if Joe Dante (Gremlins) made a movie about Space Nazi's(!), written by Paul Bartel (Death Race 2000, Eating Raoul), Produced by Roger Corman and utilizing all the advantages of CGI on a low budget and you get an idea of how awesome this movie is.<br /><br /> Not only is Iron Sky a great comedy but it's also a fantastic satire. Even more amazing is that they managed to make this for about 10 million which puts every bloated blockbuster out this summer to shame. I really can't stress how good this movie is. Sure, you look at the trailers and think \\"heh, one note joke!\\" but it's soo much more than that. I was worried that the bulk of the movie was going to be \\"cultural misunderstanding\\" comedy and although there's a little bit of that, it's not overdone.<br /><br /> At about 90 minutes long it's perfectly paced and while you're average Corman cheapie was never really able to deliver a big payoff, Iron Sky delivers a climax on par with the likes of Starship Troopers' Klendathu Drop crossed with the alien invasion of Independence Day. But unlike most high concept comedies, Iron Sky delivers an ending that is both satisfying and chilling at the same time. Can't recommend this enough.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I purchased this app without really knowing if I wanted/needed white noise for sleeping. Honestly, I thought it was kind of silly. Then I tried it - wow! You can choose from so many sounds, layer them, adjust the volume of each one (birds not so loud, rain louder and so on) and then save your specific noise. My favorite is the campfire, with crickets (not too loud) and the babbling brook. It's the next best thing to actually camping!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this for all of my devices and love it.  Thanks for such an easy excessible app to use.
B001974DG0|5.0|I've seldom come across a Dean Koontz reader who doesn't say, \\"Watchers was my favorite.\\"<br /><br />It's typical Koontz.  Old Koontz novels are pretty formula stuff, and it's a formula that worked well.  A kid/family that you love, a dog that you care about and either a serial killer or some secret black government operation...or both.<br /><br />\\"Watchers\\" has the best dog in literature.  Yeah, even better than Enzo from 'The Art Racing in the Rain'.<br /><br />And the novel has all the suspense of Dean Koontz.  If you read only one Dean Koontz novel in your life...make it Watchers!<br /><br />I read it when it came out...maybe the late 80s, early 90s?...and read it again and again.

0143117009|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book as I had read several other books that trace the rise and fall of various civilizations and underlying causes.  This book seemed very promising, but was really just a series of isolated examples of very minor backwater civilizations being used to prove a political argument, rather than present a convincing discussion of how civilizations evolve and then end.<br /><br />His major argument is that big business neglects the environment and if this continues, our civilization will collapse.  This sounds a bit silly when stated flat out and seems likely a highly questionable conlusion based on ancedotal, n=1 style evidence.  However he cloaks the argument in several hundred pages of rambling discussion, much of it with a very moral overtone.  The moral overtone itself, is very much a turn off, but it serves the purpose of highlighting that he is not detached enough from the value based argument to evalute his own \\"evidence\\" and questionable, tenous conclusions and reasoning.  The book strikes one as strangely myopic, clinging to individual, one-off data points to support a value based perspective and moderately irrational as it rambles and struggles to connect the ideas being expressed.
1416914285|5.0|I've recently been a little tired of reading YA/teen books, and thought I should go on a break from them for awhile. This book brought back my interest in the genre. I, admittedly, was about to give up reading the book after I read the first chapter, but I'm glad I didn't because after the third chapter, it piqued my interest and made the book unputdownable. Although I really didn't feel like putting my brain through learning the imaginary world of yet another YA author, Cassandra Clare made the knowledge flow natural and connected the elements in a way that told the story in an adventurous fluidity. City of Bones has made me a fan of Cassandra Clare's work and because of this (and I really want to know the rest of the story) I'm going to finish reading this series and her Infernal Devices series.<br />----<br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"He turned around. His eyes, very blue behind the glasses, rested on her with a look of firm affection. 'Clary, you're an artist, like your mother. That means you see the world in ways that other people don't. It's your gift, to see the beauty and the horror in ordinary things. It doesn't make you crazy--just different. There's nothing wrong with being different.'\\" (23)
1400069289|1.0|Life the universe and everything viewed through the lens of habit.<br /><br />I was very happy to get this book through the Vine program. I got the advanced copy. Sadly, the publisher thought that a book like this didn't need annotation to be reviewed. The footnote are included but not knowing what is being attributed makes them all but worthless.<br /><br />I did look at a few footnotes and I'll mention two in particular below.<br /><br />It is well written in that it reads like a novel. There is no doubt that Mr. Duhigg is an able professional writer capable of telling a story in an interesting manner. That is very valuable and I looked forward to reading the book because of it.<br /><br />What it turned out to be was a long winded fuzzy restatement of known behavioral science.<br /><br />The book is rife with it but one thing that really stood out was the cabbage story. See, the military started including *fresh* cabbage with meals for soldiers. If you've ever eaten fresh cabbage you know why it wasn't a big hit. They started serving it boiled and soldiers started eating it. Duhigg's analysis is that the resulting increase in consumption was because the dish was now prepared in a way familiar to the soldiers and thus they ate it out of habit! I must ask, has this man ever eaten raw cabbage and cooked cabbage? The taste, texture and appearance are night and day.<br /><br />One of the stories is about the song Hey Ya. According to research, people say they don't like songs but actually they secretly like and listen to them. When you check the footnote for it the research Duhigg is referring to is a group of 800 people given pager devices. These devices relieve the subject of having to keep a diary. The question is, how do the researchers know that the wearer doesn't just sit the device down on the table and walk off when a crappy song comes on just like people use commercials to do stuff around the house?<br /><br />I've got some other serious gripes with the bookbut they are more subjective so I'll put them in a comment.<br /><br />It is an easy book to read and it is well written and that is about all it has going for it.
1416914307|5.0|The ending may be a bit predictable, but the book was way better than the second. I found the character developments enlightening and there was a lot more action, interspersed with love rather than overwhelmed with it. The twists and turns this book takes ties in all of the character relations and developments from the previous two books seamlessly. The story line was fueled by determination, passion, war, and even unity as the Shadowhunters, Downworlders, Angels and Demons collide.<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"'I don't want to talk about this, Alec. Not now, not ever. Don't ask me about it again.' Jace's tone was savage, and Alec fell silent. Clary cold almost feel his hurt. What a night, Clary thought. A night of so much pain for everyone.\\" (287)
B008VNI9IS|5.0|The principal attraction of this 2010 production of Tosca from the Teatro Carlo Felice di Genova is that it the staging is based on Adolf Hohenstein's original production designs from 1900. The gritty realism of the sets, particularly the Sant' Andrea chapel of Act I and in the Castel Sant' Angelo of Act III, look superb, fitting perfectly with the melodramatic verismo nature of a work that is not so much concerned with grand themes or concepts as much as in relating a human drama of love, jealousy and passion set against the backdrop of revolutionary activity, writ large in the sweep and tug of Puccini's grand score. This is how Tosca was originally meant to be seen, and this is as close as you can get to its original intentions. There's merit in this alone, but it's even better when the opera is played and sung as well as it's done here.<br /><br />It would be all too easy to just go through the motions in such a well-known opera, in a very traditional production and it's easy for the listener to become blasé about yet another production of Tosca, but there's no sign of any complacency here from any of the main performers and never any danger of the listener remaining detached from it all. There's a real sense of commitment in Daniela Dessì's Floria Tosca and in Fabio Armiliato's Caravadossi. Neither are as young as they used to be, and the close-ups in High Definition are rather unforgiving, but there's no substitute for experience. There's scarcely a weakness anywhere in their performances or their singing, a perfect pairing who work exceptionally well together. You don't often get that, and it's something remarkably special when you get such a connection.<br /><br />Neither singer gives any sense of this being a prestige performance, but both are clearly totally involved in the roles for the sake of the drama. It's unfortunate then that the performance here includes in-the-moment encores for 'Vissi d'arte' and 'E lucevan le stelle' that disrupts the dramaticflow, but on the other hand, it is a recording of a live performance of a popular work for a paying public and there's no question that the encores called for here are merited and impressively reprised. Claudio Sgura isn't quite as strong as Scarpia, but it's a fine attempt at a more human performance of a role that is more often played - and unfortunately scored as such by Puccini - as a caricature baddie.<br /><br />Superbly directed for TV, capturing all the intensity and passion of the live performance as well as the beauty of the stage production, this Tosca looks and sounds tremendous on Blu-ray. Image and sound are just about flawless. There are no extra features on the disc and no synopsis in the booklet, but the background to the work and its plot are covered in an essay. BD25, 1080i full-HD, PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1, All regions, subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.
038572179X|4.0|I really wish I would've known about the book before seeing the movie, because of course I would've read the novel first. Because I saw the movie first, the book seemed a bit drawn out, overly descriptive and tedious. I felt like I could skip a few paragraphs, or even pages, and still not have missed out on the overall plot. This is a great reason I don't like watching the movies before reading the book. That said, I did absolutely love the original story line and overall plot. The exploitation of a child's innocence was taken in a grim view of over-fantasized dramatic life sequences that played off of that child's objection to reality, and later, guilt. This novel is quite the page turner.
B0032Y0OH0|3.0|I'm a bit disappointed that this device doesn't come with Audacity 2 support out of the box. It's not like Audacity is an unknown app, or not widely used. The ShuttleXpress requires the user to create their own usage map, and that's time consuming. Without knowing the device as well as I will in, say, a month of use, I'm just taking stabs at what will and won't work with it.<br /><br />Having said that, it works nicely once it's set up, and it comes with dozens of other programs that are already part of the driver package, Adobe Photoshop being one. My use, however, was to combine this device with my recordings on Audacity that I do for Librivox DOT org. I wanted it to emulate a jog wheel that is part of a dedicated video or audio editor so that I can advance or back up to a specific point and then mark it. The Xpress is limited to the keyboard shortcuts that are available in Audacity, as it is with any other program. If something can't be done via the keyboard, then you won't be able to do it via the ShuttleXpress either. Therefore, if you're looking to provide the functionality of a dedicated editing system, the ShuttleXpress is not going to work. In addition, this is not meant to supplant a mouse or trackpad, it's designed to work in conjunction with it. That gets back to the statement that the ShuttleXpress will only work with existing keyboard shortcuts. Anything else you'll need to do manually.<br /><br />I do think that once I get accustomed to using it, and have it programmed, that it will be a big help in my recording and editing chores. Unfortunately, as stated above, the lack of Audacity 2 support out of the box is very disappointing. I simply can't be the only person using this device for this purpose. Unfortunately, both the Audacity and Contour forums aren't of much help in finding a driver map that can be imported or adopted, so if that's your software, be aware that you'll have to create it on your own. Ditto for any other software that isn't supported out of the box by Contour.<br /><br />Lastly, for Mac users, if you're upgrading to Mountain Lion, you'll need to download an updated driver from the Contour website. Save yourself some aggravation of having to uninstall the one that comes with the device (a suggested requirement by the manufacturer for the updated driver), and download it first, then proceed with your software installation.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty capable device that would, in my case, have had much more utility with an existing Audacity map.ed out of the box by Contour.<br /><br />Lastly, for Mac users, if you're upgrading to Mountain Lion, you'll need to download an updated driver from the Contour website.

1416972242|3.0|I liked the book, just not as much as the first in it's series. It didn't seem to have as much action... just more focus on love and, dare I say it, incest? Well, there may be some clues that the latter might not be true, with the actions of the Inquisitor in the end, as well as some other things that I won't get into because I don't want to include spoilers. In all the book advances the knowledge and strengths of the main characters as they fight to figure out Valentine's intentions and battles. I only hope City of Glass restores my interest in the series, because this book didn't have the zing that the previous book did.<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"'I remember you saying that growing up happens when you start having things you look back on and wish you could change. I guess that means I've grown up now. It's just that --that I--' I thought you'd be there when I did.\\" (209)
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I had a few misgivings when I learned of Catwoman being in this final part of the saga.  The Michael Keaton/Catwoman movie was a bit too silly (still better than the two that followed) and I was afraid that the same thing might happen again.  While the young lady that plays the part seems like a fine actor and certainly looked great in the catsuit I still felt that the character detracted from the movie.  It was formulaic.....Batman trusts her from the outset to do the right thing, she disappoints repeatedly, finally she does it.  Not exactly new.<br /><br />The movie tries to combine the best of the comic book storylines of \\"No Man's Land\\" and \\"Knightfall\\" and it's simply too big of a task.  Those stories went on for months; to try to adapt them to less than three hours is ....a tall order.  Just as those comic book stories had their weaknesses so does the movie.  The Batman is too accessible, too public, too much in the daylight.  There is no element of mystery and very little finesse.  Batman doesn't outthink his enemies as much as he simply goes through them.  In all fairness, the same was true of these comic stories.  Batman is less \\"the world's greatest detective\\" anymore than he is violent and this is part and parcel of the movie.<br /><br />While it was good to see Batman back on the big screen it wasn't that good.  Here's hoping they don't wait a decade to redo him again.
0140177396|5.0|A great short read. The story was infinitely better than what I thought it would be. The connection and symbolism between Candy & his Dog and George & Lennie came as quite a shock and made me view George and Lennie in a new light. The book situated around different aspects of loneliness (of how some long for company, and others long for solitude) and how sometimes ridding yourself of burdens, no matter how painful and emotional it may be, is the only way to move on. The book was very moving and I definitely recommend this to any and everyone.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is a perfect example of the way hype sells books. While Fifty Shades is not a terrible novel, and I found no glaring spelling errors, the repetition of certain words and phrases is irritating, to say the least. Isn't there a better way to describe Gray's facial expressions instead of \\"he smirked\\"? I lost count after about 10.<br />  Therapists are aware that sadists and masochists find each other and create painful relationships, but most of us prefer to think of love as a warm, physical and emotional bond between two humans. After the age of twenty or so, there is not much titillation in reading about the paraphenalia used in kinky sex. So why are people buying the book? Buzz. I wasted a little money to find out what the hype was all about. And now I know...much ado about nothing. But kudos to e.l.james for having the smarts to release all three at the same time. Brilliant marketing. We will probably see a plethora of S&M books this year, following James' financial success. Just like vampire stories.

And I appreciate the author shedding light on the darker side of sexy!

I like to check a number of sites for information I can trust. If you're reading this, you know Amazon is the best place to find out what others like or dislike about the  thousands of products available on Amazon. TripAdvisor is another valuable site. Though I am relatively new (this year) to this app, I have already found it very useful. Try it.

The best thing is her weekly cook up tips! Makes this soooooo easy :) the other best thing is the Rogan Josh! Made it with 2+ lbs of stew meat and had hoped to have left overs for lunch...no such luck! The whole family loved it. Also love the \\"best chicken you've ever eaten\\" it reminds me of an Indian restaurant in Germany's Tandoori chicken! Delicious stuff throughout!! My daughter drank the Moroccan dipping sauce! I look through it every day and keep finding more and more stuff to make! PS: we are only on our 9th day of the whole 30!
B006IDG2T6|4.0|This a is very easy to read book and short enough to not worry about getting started on. I finished it in two or three sessions. A very good look at what makes us think and the almost spiritual topic of free will. I have my doubts though about the author's conclusions that we don't really have free will, but it is definitely great food for thought and may challenge one's notions of individual responsibility, fate, destiny, and human behavior.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought the G13 when I started getting back into MMOs. I'm conditioned to console gaming, so using a keyboard & mouse feels clunky & counterintuitive to me. The G13 does a lot to remedy that. It's certainly a more comfortable and natural way to play, & the customization options let you prioritize your actions. It looks nice & I haven't had a single problem getting it to do everything it promises to do.<br /><br />If there is a downside (and isn't there always?) it's that it is a little large and therefore awkward for my tiny lady-hands .<br /><br />Bonus neat thing: the preset game profiles. I was bored one day & fired up Dragon Age: Origins. It recognized the game immediately & already had some standard presets.
0425263908|4.0|I would definitely recommend this book. There's a very compelling story here about two rather damaged people coming together.  Much has been made about it's similarity to Fifty Shades of Grey and I have to agree that to me it read like the author read FSOG and said, \\"I can do it better.\\"  So, in some respects it IS a better book; more polished, better edited, tighter plot.  In other respects though I don't think it works quite as well.  Whereas FSOG has (in my opinion) a balance with one damaged character (Christian) and one pristine character (Ana), BTY has two very damaged leads in Eva and Gideon.  It made BTY uncomfortably intense at times and almost manic.  There was a lot of lust and a lot of conflict and a lot of Eva running away and Gideon chasing her and it all made for passion and lust and need and intensity, but I don't know that I'm buying \\"love\\" yet.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book.  I thought the love scenes were pretty darn hot.  I really loved how complete and mature a character Eva is. I liked the dynamics with Cary (her roommate).  What I didn't like was Gideon who (so far) reads a little flat to me.  I will certainly read the sequel, but I find it a little funny that I'm more anticipating what will happen with their therapy sessions than what will happen in the bedroom.

I saw the reviews on this and thought, \\"Wow, those are some seriously high reviews for what appears to be an unreleased, possibly B Movie.\\"  I decided to give it a try.  WOW!!!! Mel Gibson FINALLY redeems himself.  The fact that this never hit the theaters is a disgrace.  This is an awesome movie.  I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson due to the last couple of years, but the boy redeems himself.  This movie is gritty, mad action, great story it's solidly comparable to Slum Dog Millionaire.  Skip whatever else you are considering, this is a must see movie, so good!
0061692042|4.0|For most of us, transitioning from child to young adult proved an ordinary, mostly uneventful experience (though, probably, none of us really felt that way about it as it happened to us).  Not so for the 66-year-old narrator recounting those years in his life.  In one of the most memorable and arresting openings in a long time, Dell announces that his parents robbed a bank and that murderers occurred.<br /><br />As Ford slowly unfolds his bildungsroman in simple yet evocative prose, we meet Dell's parents, a mismatch of thoughtful and brash, Bev and Neeva, and his rebellious sister, Berner, odd names for odd people.  They live in Great Falls, Montana, where Bev served in the Air Force as a Captain, until he resigned his commission after a demotion over a misguided and bungled fraud involving beef and Native Americans.  Unable to cope with civilian life, he gets involved in a situation with those same culprits that results in him robbing a bank, ringing his wife into the affair, and, eventually, leaving Dell and Berner on the verge of becoming wards of Montana.<br /><br />Then, Berner flees and a friend of Dell's mother rescues him, transporting him to the care of her brother, the mysterious Arthur Remlinger, a man with a troubled back story, hunkered in the wheat fields of Saskatchewan, waiting.  Arthur proves a distant guardian, until he reveals his motive for taking in Dell.  Up to that time, Charlie Quarters, a very strange and scary and malformed individual, an all-around hand who handles Remlinger's geese hunting business and other chores, takes charge of Dell.<br /><br />The tale is told in multiple parts, but really there are two.  First, Dell tries to understand his parents and their relationship to him and his place in the world.  He longs for friends, for some stability, in place of the nomadic and uncertain existence the family has had up to Great Falls.  Leading up to and after the bank robbery, in which Bev contemplated involving him, the nefarious doubled, and compounded, later with Arthur Remlinger, he attempts understanding his father and mother and recounts how their lives affect his and Berner's.<br /><br />Second, Dell finds himself nowhere on the desolate wheat plains of Saskatchewan in a shack under the tutelage of Charlie Quarters.  When he had hoped to be in school making friends, getting on with his life, he is instead adrift, wondering who Arthur Remlinger is and what he might have in store for him.  It isn't good.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Ford's other work, such as the Bascombe series, you'll find CANADA similar and different:  similar in the introspective nature of the story and the descriptive detail of places and people; different in that CANADA has an honest to goodness plot as it is a suspense novel of sorts, but without suspense being the main objective.<br /><br />Recommended for Ford's writing verve and for the thoughtful treatment of a lost boy who eventually discovers himself and makes a life.led, and compounded, later with Arthur Remlinger, he attempts understanding his father and mother and recounts how their lives affect his and Berner's.<br /><br />Second, Dell finds himself nowhere on the desolate wheat plains of Saskatchewan in a shack under the tutelage of Charlie Quarters.

0896762629|5.0|When I last heard from Janet, this books was in parts on her living room floor. She sadly passed away, and her students have thankfully finished it. It is as detailed as her prior books,( also called Patterns of Fashion) and as a 16th century costumer (I've taught classes on the clothing in historical St. Augustine) I adore the detail. The color photos are fabulous, and I wish Arnold's prior works could have had some of this color photography. The close up photos are all the historical researcher would wish for. This book is NOT for the casual costumer, but more for those researching historical details on 16th and 17th century underclothes and accessories. Patterns are also included, as is typical of Arnold's books.

The book is real in every way, including the family side, which I havent seen in other works. I recommend to any former trooper or to anyone who wants to be able to see how the bravest of the brave live.

1476712042|3.0|Summary:<br />Now that Abby is off to college, she can finally leave her old life behind and start over as a whole new girl. The only person who knows about her dark past is her best friend America - and Abby plans to keep it that way. When she meets Travis, she knows he's everything she's trying to leave behind, but she still can't seem to stay away from him. In an effort to keep Abby in his life, Travis makes a bet with her... If he wins, Abby has to live in his apartment for a month. If he loses, he has to give up his steady stream of women for a month. But the bet is just the beginning of the roller coaster ride for Abby & Travis.<br /><br />Review:<br />I had a love / hate relationship with this book. I loved the story and the writing, but I kinda hated the characters. And yet, despite being appalled by how incredibly stupid and messed-up the main characters were, I devoured their story and couldn't stop myself from rooting for them. To be fair, I think characters were well developed and realistic; they just weren't the greatest people. But, crazy and impulsive behaviour is pretty common when you're in college so I could often understand the irrational actions even if I didn't agree with them. That aside, the story flows well and sucks you in with a surprising amount of twists and turns. Just when you think it must be over, there's another bump in the road for Abby & Travis.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I could NOT put this book down. While I can't quite say that Beautiful Disaster a good book, I still loved it. And even though it makes no sense for this to be a series, I'm sure I'll read Walking Disaster (Beautiful #2) when it comes out!

B008JAFXOQ|4.0|Kenneth Lonergan's Margaret (2012): Just watched the 150 minute cut of this. I was reminded of several of Alexander Payne's films while watching, especially Election (1999). The two directors share a very similar moral vision: people are not as connected to each other (or as moral) as they might think, they tell stories so they feel connected to something (themselves maybe), but their stories just make them all the more aware of how isolated and compromised they really are. The films of both directors never end with any kind of resolution or redemption, they just end. I don't know that Lonergan is the more ambitious of the two, but he is certainly the more artsy (and by artsy I suppose I mean ambiguous). \\"Margaret\\" for instance is not the name of any character in the film, rather that is the name of a character in a Hopkins poem read aloud in an English class. The main character's name is Lisa, a high school senior, who experiences a traumatic event and becomes either a) so sensitive to the ongoing tragedies in the world around her that she ceases to think her own existence even matters, or, b) so callous that she cannot take pleasure in anything unless it inflicts harm upon others. Lisa switches back and forth between these extremes, sometimes in the course of single conversations. Its very difficult to say what the trauma has done to her or what kind of person Lisa is. You keep watching but its hard to know what to make of the character or the film. Even at 150 minutes, this still reads like the first chapter of a much longer work. This is solid filmmaking but ultimately unsatisfying because incomplete.

Upon speaking to people who have read it they said continue reading. I did and eventually it got a little better but when it all came together I felt like this book was a waste of my time. It doesn't deserve to be on the bestsellers list and I'm glad I didn't buy it,it was borrowed if from the library. This is the worst mystery/crime novel I ever ready. Don't waste your time with this..
003061368X|5.0|This book was recommended to me because of my fascination and interest in history. The author takes the bare bones of 14th and 15th century English history and makes it alive and vivid with all the human complexities inherent in the \\"Human Condition,\\" which is made up of joy and sorrow. She especially casts new life and interpretations of King Richard the 3rd, both before and during his reign. Perhaps,he in fact was not the scoundrel portrayed in Shakespeare and English history described by many historians

Almost.<br />Love a lot of the songs (though I could do without a few that I just find a bit annoying). I can't get ENOUGH of the cover of Prince's Kiss - it has a swing edge, and I love it.<br />Let's be honest - no album is EVER going to live up to Songs About Jane. I could easily say that I LOVED every song on that album - but I'm happy with this one, and I feel like their back on the right track. I disagree with the negative reviews.

B004AKCMD4|4.0|A bit of a retelling of \\"The Hidden Fortress\\" mixed with \\"Excalibur\\" but for the kiddies The Owls of Ga'Hoole is a dizzyingly beautiful visual feast on Blu-ray.  When brothers are taken from their home fear and courage separate them into camps of malevolent brainwashed bad guys and prisoner of war rebels who run into each other at movies end for their own personal showdown.  Because this is essentially a movie aimed at children the parent would probably think and expect that the brother turned bad would see the error of his ways and come back to the side of his courageous, righteous brother.  The parent would be wrong in this case as the story presents more of an unsettingly reality, and consequences, than what we have come to expect from the average kids movie.  Don't get me wrong: the good guys still win here but there are real losers.<br /><br />After you see this movie do yourself more of a favor--patronize your local zoo and check out their owls.  They really are magnificent birds.

0553386794|5.0|I don't expect to be able to add any original or innovative thoughts about this series when it's already been picked apart and talked about by so many readers since its release  sixteen years ago.  However, I just wanted to jot down a few thoughts about the book.  First of all, despite all the hype and my fondness for fantasy novels thusfar, I didn't actually pick up the book entirely for the book's sake.  I decided I should finally watch the HBO show.  But because I'm me and have certain quirks, I  felt compelled to read the book first.  That wasn't quite what happened.  Thanks to some wonderful wiki contributors, I found a guide to which episodes corresponded to which chapters online (the \\"Notes\\" section of the episode guides on the wikia GoT wiki).  So, I read the chapters for each episode, then watched the episode shortly afterwards.  This approach really worked for me, and I found myself enjoying both the book and the show immensely.  This approach helped me picture some of the areas and characters, and helped me keep everything straight.  If you haven't watched the show or read the book but you want to, you might consider doing the same.  I was glad I did.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad the show adhered quite closely to the novel, because I loved the book.  For me, it definitely lived up to the hype.  George R. R. Martin has a true talent for world-building and story crafting.  While some might complain that the novel is too complicated, has too many characters and intricacies, I was blown away that Martin was able to craft such a detailed world.  But just because he obviously spent so much time on the environment, surroundings, and lore doesn't mean that the characters suffered for it.  Quite the opposite, actually.  The characters were are a real strong point in the novel.  I particularly like Tyrion and Daenerys, was interested in Arya, Bran and Jon, looked forward to major events happening with Catelyn and Eddard, was disturbed by the events in the Eyrie, and loved to hate Cersei and Joffrey.  This is a strong fantasy novel.  As long as dwarves and elves aren't a prerequisite for you enjoying a fantasy world, Game of Thrones has plenty to offer you.  A detailed world, interwoven characters and events, plenty of intrigue and betrayal.  I expect you won't be disappointed.d loved to hate Cersei and Joffrey.  This is a strong fantasy novel.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend, and I did enjoy it. I had it read in a weekend. That being said, I'm shocked this is a professionally published title. There were far more typos than I would expect...tons. It felt more like a low-budget self-published book (I seriously have nothing against self-publishing, but I had to go back and check if it really was a S&S published book!). I definitely found the characters and relationship disturbing. I was waiting for the relationship to end in physical abuse or worse. Of course, this kept me reading because I had to see if Abby made it to the end of the book alive. That being said, I thought the ending was strange and rushed. Overall, it was a good read that brought up a hint of nostalgia from some of my own college experiences (sans the underground fighting!!). Though I can't say I'll be spending the $$ for the follow-up from Travis's perspective.
B006CHML4I|5.0|this watch has a technical/military-ish looking dial (is it modelled after a Stowa aviator watch?) but very pretty hands, and the details on the dial have a look of precision and delicacy (like the little dots of luminescent paint on the five-minute marks) A very nice everyday watch -- elegant but casual.<br /><br />I'm a little puzzled by the reviews about how noisy the watch was -- if you shake it hard and put your ear near it, you can faintly hear the little weighted thing that winds the watch go back and forth. Not a problem for me, anyway.
0307592731|5.0|While I agree with several other reviewers that Cheryl created many of her own problems, I could not help but be drawn in by her willingness to confront her demons, her courage in making the three-month hike on the PCT, and her wonderful way with words. At age 65 (well, let's be honest--at any age), I am not inspired to strap on a backpack, but I found Cheryl's account riveting, enjoying the digressions into her past as much as her actual experiences on the trail.

B002MT3CIY|1.0|Got to say I am a BIG Pink Floyd fan and wanted to \\"test\\" and see what an \\"unofficial\\" DVD release of Delicate Sound of Thunder would look and sound like. Glad I only paid ten bucks, because the nicest thing about this heap is the cover. It looks professional. Even the disc is \\"pressed\\" and not burned onto a DVD-R like most bootlegs. But may the Pink Floyd gods have mercy on who released this rubbish! Like another reviewer stated, the image was to be square 1.33 and not what ever they did to this mess. This looks worse than zoom being used. It seems...I don't know what! It looks to be out of some shape because nothing looks right (especially their video screen)!! This is absurdity at its best! I can't even mention the sound, because I didn't watch enough of this garbage to even think about how it sounded. I could not get past the terrible blurry, blown up, stretched out video image.<br />Be warned if you expect good quality from this version. Because it ain't there. This is one disappointed Floyd fan. I'll stick to the awesome Pulse concert while waiting for an OFFICIAL release of Delicate Sound of Thunder. Now if they would only release Pulse on blu ray!! Wow! Now that would be a visual treat!

I have no idea how this book was actually published with such omissions.  I have this on Kindle, so maybe the paper copy has the citations to the actual studies.<br /><br />On the positive side, Matthews is correct in pointing out the regular B.S. that people have heard or think is true.

William Landay has written a 'straight from the headlines' book about today's youth, bullying, social media and its effect on the family. \\"Defending Jacob\\" is a great read for book clubs as it has so many topics for discussion:  How far would you go to protect your child? Do you believe in the theory of a murder gene?  Highly recommend this book!
B002M89UMW|5.0|This sparkling musical is set in St. Louis in 1903. It tells the story of a year in the life of the Smith family and the script by Irving Beecher and Fred Finkelhoffe was created out of a series of short stories in the New Yorker magazine written by Sally Benson. The storyline is filled for the most part with the trivia of everyday family life except that father (Leon Ames) is offered a job in New York, to the consternation of the rest of the family, only to decide against it later. Mary Astor played the mother of the family and Marjorie Main was the redoubtable maid. But the star of course was Judy Garland who played Esther, one of the four daughters of the Smith family. She had a few lovely songs to sing written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane - `The trolley song', `Have yourself a merry little Christmas', and `The boy next door'. The boy in question was played by Tom Drake. The title song was composed by Andrew B. Sterling and Kerry Mills. The direction was by Vincente Minnelli, using Technicolor for the first time. This was a splendid and thoroughly enjoyable movie.
B007HJ84ZK|4.0|I hear what all the critics were saying about this being a good series. The cinematography alone is insane for an HBO series. The casting is excellent and the acting is good too. The are 2-3 to good story lines in the first season but the other story lines are marginal and left me wanting/expecting more. I heard so many good things about this series that maybe my expectations were too high. You need to really pay attention to the plots as there are 7 different thrones and too many different and confusing character names to remember. If it were not for the nudity/ sexual scenes in the first few episodes I would of given this a 3 star rating. Gotta love those brothels in the medieval times!
B000I0QL82|4.0|This black-and-white musical (Paramount, 1942) was the first to pair Bing Crosby with Fred Astaire. They play a song-and-dance duo that split up when Crosby decides that it is time to retire and he opens up a holiday inn in Connecticut - one that will open only on public holidays! There were eight public holidays celebrated in the film, with two for 4th July. Those familiar with White Christmas (Paramount, 1954) will recognize that this is essentially the same theme, except that the inn there is owned by a retired general who is only too happy to have guests the whole year round.<br /><br />The score for Holiday Inn was provided by Irving Berlin (words and music) and he also created the basic storyline. Many Berlin standards that we have come to know and love from the hit parade were first heard in this film - and sometimes recycled as themes for other films (like White Christmas and Easter Parade). Berlin's `Lazy' also appeared for the first time to be given a much more erotic interpretation in later years by Marilyn Monroe. Eydie Gorme gave a classic interpretation later on record of `Be careful, it's my heart'. Bob Crosby's Bobcats were on hand to provide some of the music. The female leads in the film are played by Marjorie Reynolds (whose singing voice was dubbed by Martha Mears) and Virginia Dale and the film was produced and directed by Mark Sandrich.<br /><br />The New York Post described this as `The best musical drama of the year': 100 minutes of pure joy!

B005HSG3U6|1.0|I bought this item and it got broken in a little more than 2 months so I don't think you should buy this item. I called Customer Service to explain the problem and they offered me a 50% refund, I wonder why? It is not my fault this product is damaged but they told me is the policy.<br />I am really disappointed.
B005FMZVLQ|3.0|I have enjoyed wearing this watch, especially since I wear my wristwatches on my right. There are very few left handed watches available at any price point.<br /><br />All my watches are extremely well taken care of. I seldom wear one two days in a row and they are stored in either a watch winder or watch case, depending on the movement.<br /><br />I have had this model for over two years and it had been trouble free until a few days ago. Then the small hour hand for the timer fell off. This was under normal wear. I had an extended warranty, so was not concerned. However, when I went to Invicta's site for info on getting the watch repaired, I found a number of concerns. One, you must prepay for shipping the watch back to you. And, they charge $28 for shipping. Plus, you are paying to ship the watch back to them. Also, I received a notice that the repair estimate was close to $40 if it is not covered by warranty. There are no guidelines as to way it would not be covered.<br /><br />So, at a minimum, you are paying at least $40 for shipping both ways. Possibly another $40 in repair work. In addition, they say it will take 3 months to complete the work. Given how much I paid for the watch, this makes no sense at all. Why wait three months and end up paying close to the purchase price to get a repaired item back?<br /><br />Unfortunately, this does not seem like a viable option and I can't recommend this company.<br />(NOTE: this entire series is essentially the same watch.)<br />Invicta Men's 1512 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap WatchInvicta Men's 1515 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap WatchInvicta Men's 1516 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap WatchInvicta Men's 1513 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap WatchInvicta Men's 1516 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap Watch
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this for use on my D90 when taking landscape shots on a tripod. The cable length works nicely for my needs. The connector has a tight fit when plugging it in to the camera.<br /><br />Overall, it's very easy to operate and great value for the money -- works as expected.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|\\"11/22/63\\" is probably my favorite Stephen King book ever.  As a teenager I devoured his books, even doing a final class report comparing one of his short stories against an HG Wells story.  My other favorite book of his is The Stand, which is an amazing journey through an entire universe, similar to this story.  I had not picked up any of his books in many years, but what a return.  His tone and pace of storytelling was familiar and great to revisit, and I was pulled into the world of this story quickly and had a hard time putting the book down.  It made for great reading while I was spending a lot of time on airplanes as I was transported to another place literally and figuratively.  If you enjoy a fully engaging story with intense characters, and aren't afraid of a long read, I highly recommend this book.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief explores the reality of Hitlerian Germany from the late 1930s into the 40s through the experiences of a young woman whose story is told by Death.  Death is the ever present reality, but it is not the death of the extermination camps or the war front, though both loom ominously in the background. In this highly active moment in the long life of Death emerges the experience of Liesel, who is confronted by Death so soon in her young life she cannot possibly understand his character; however, life in the little town outside Munich offers immense possibilities for getting to know death on a more intimate level. Liesel's instinct is for life in all of its ordinary and extraordinary manifestations. Without much thought, she steals life by stealing books. The power of words to enhance life confronts the power of words to destroy life as Mein Kampf demonstrates. Mein Kampf is a looming even ironic presence throughout the novel.<br /><br />I read this book for a book club to which I belong.  This was not the selection I voted for because I was not in the mood for another Holocaust novel.  The Book Thief is not that.  It's an allegory on living. Markus Zusak uses Germany under Hitler to explore what it means to be alive in the face of death.  We are always life in the face of death but rarely have to confront his presence so intensely. (I use the male pronouns here because the great purveyor of death in Hitlerian Germany is male.) For some reason I'm reminded of Thorton Wilder's \\"Our Town\\" where the most ordinary elements of life in the ever-presence of death become utterly beautiful and awesome.<br /><br />I was disappointed in only one aspect: the novel was too long.  I had trouble getting through the last hundred pages or so.  The story ends up being tedious and repetitive; however, that should not keep a person from the experience.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I was blissfully surprised at the smirky humor and learning value of the book.  I think unlike many children's books, this allows the reader to enjoy a story while learning Greek mythology.  It was very easy to understand the Gods and myths when in this format (easier than the actual myths which I find confusing, although not near as confusing after reading this). It was fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone- from my best friend's daughter to my own grandmother.  I plan to read them all.
1469984202|5.0|I bought this entire series one at a time on my kindle and loved it so much I had to buy a hard copy to be able to share with others!
0670022950|5.0|A must read!  Vital information!  A long term statistic report on civilization, that evidences our progress and evolution and why we have not failed but rather continued to make advances as a people, that ensure our survival. Earth people are doing well!  Thanks to all that contributed to the motion!

B006WXW098|5.0|There were a number of naysayers around when the beautiful, petite, fashionably gowned Yuja Wang first stepped onto the stage, wowing audiences first with her appearance then with her demeanor and finally with her technical prowess and intense musicality - offering comments like `flash in the pan showmanship' etc.  But this young artist continues to grow, maintaining all her allure while constantly reassuring audiences that she knows very well her instrument and her musicianship.<br /><br />This recording is almost like an extended thank you to her growing audience.  The works here are not only difficult to perform but they are brief and offer a spectrum of her abilities. Some may label this a grab bag of audience favorites - and that may just be what she has in mind: give them what they want and deserve. And so she tosses off Rachmaninov Etudes, a sparkling and light fingered Scarlatti sonata, an arrangement of themes from Gluck's `Orfeo', Alb&eacute;niz' Iberia selection, Bizet's `Carmen' in transcription, the Schubert/Liszt Gretchen am Spinnrade, as well as works by Strauss, Chopin, Scriabin, Dukas, Saint-Saens.  It is a veritable feast of gloriously performed magic.  The only thing missing is the joy of watching this young artist in action!  Highly recommended for those who know the artistry of Yuja Wang as well as those who are wondering what all the talk is about.  Grady Harp, August 12
B008JGSM6G|4.0|at times it is fun and addictive. but at other times u have a need to play a different game. so that's why I only like it not love it. thx
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|A perfect compliment to their debut album, Halestorm's Lzzy Hale shows you why she is considered 1 of todays most influencial singer/songwriters. Showing her soft underside for the 1st time in never before unleashed ballads, her powerful lyrics & unmistakable voice will raise you to the roof & then drag you across the floor. Do not pass this album by.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I am wondering why everyone was raving over this.  It was like wading through treacle.  Only read them all as I had paid for the Trilogy. Not a book I would recommend. Complete and utter rubbish!!!  Wondering if Kindle version is abridged and all the substance was edited out?<br />Don't waste your money.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|From cover to cover, this album is amazing. If you like Shinedown, or are just vaguely familiar w/ them, you will LOVE this album!!
1423113462|5.0|Sweeping fantasy for young adults. The interwoven elements of Greek mythology make this a truly wonderful fantasy adventure series. Yet, despite the fantasy element, the characters are very easy to relate to as they undergo similar travails as those of readers of the target age group.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|the app is great the books fit on my sd card and i can read them whenever i want. however the app will stop working or freeze at times but as long as you dont force shut down it tends to fix itself.
1455508977|5.0|Loved this sweet, tender love story. Every woman dreams of meeting Mr. Right who will sweep her off her feet, and Mr. Sparks certainly makes this fantasy come true in The Lucky One. A wonderful read for a cozy night indoors.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was ecstatic about the Hunger Games trilogy when I got to the end of the first book. And then it was time for me to start the second book. I would pick it up with great anticipation, but just couldn't get into it. I think I had to restart it about four or five times, get past those first couple of chapters, and then I was able to fully immerse myself in it. I have no idea why it takes me so long to get into these books. Once it got going, though, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games and now must go on their Victory Tour. Katniss is torn between her true feelings for Gale and her show of feelings for Peeta. She does have some feelings for him; they just are not the same. The love triangle heats up in this book, especially once Katniss hears what the Capitol is expecting her to do.<br /><br />The stakes are also higher in this book. Katniss and Peeta have incited rebellion in some of the Districts. Granted, they were just waiting for an opportunity to have an uprising, but here it is. This puts both of them and their loved ones into more danger.<br /><br />This is also the 75th anniversary of the Hunger Games, which means it is a Quarter Quell. These special editions of the Hunger Games always have some kind of sick twist to them. This one is by far the worst. Katniss does not believe for a moment that the special circumstances of this particular Quarter Quell were a part of the original plan, but she is forced to go along with it.<br /><br />Drama and danger keep the pages turning, well into the wee hours of the morning. The first-person narration as you walk inside Katniss' shoes helps to keep you engaged and to feel like you are a part of the action. I again zipped through this book and cannot wait to get my hands on the final book of the trilogy to find out what happens in the end. I am glad I continued with the series.<br /><br />This review also appears on Andi's Young Adult Books.
B0060QM09M|5.0|This book had great story telling. It was made for animal lovers. Anyone who has ever had any kind of pet would love this series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that I have a dependable alarm clock right in my Kindle Fire.  It's easy to set and takes up no extra room on my nightstand.  I always have it with me when I travel.  It doesn't need winding or electricity.  I even use it while camping.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writer has writen this book in a way that completely relates to the way I think, bringing this sexy fantasy to the brink of reality!
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This was an enjoyable reading experience.  The book was just as good as I remembered it to be. I last read it in high school over 40 years ago so I hadn't read the book with the additional material added. I highly recommend it.
0765357151|5.0|This was a very unique story in it's time and in a way it still is.  It's sad how few people know the original story and only the many film adaptations (the Vincent Price version being closest to the actual novel).  So many people don't even know the meaning behind the title \\"I am Legend.\\"  In fact many people, too used to the movies, aren't even aware that this is a vampire novel with traditional (old school, vulnerable to garlic and sacred objects) vampires.<br /><br />This is a well written and tragic story.  It really grabs you and can, surprisingly, break your heart.  Read it if you can bear it.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|I admit that I was less then enthusiastic about seeing this the first time(there are so many versions). The fact is this version is the definitive version. If you loved 'Hook' then this is a must have. The two movies together make a pretty seamless duology. If you really want to go off the deepend then check out 'Neverland' as a prequel of sorts. This movie really needs to be appreciated on Blu-Ray as the visuals are just amazing. There's a great user review of this on IMDB.COM that really does a nice job of showcasing this movie's strengths.[...]
B00007KQA3|5.0|I don't think this story really needs my review.  So many people have already said everything that needs to be said. All I can say is when I was done with reading this story I felt a trembling deep inside of myself that never fully went away.  There is a terrible truth here that needs to be seen.<br /><br />John Hurt was incredible as Winston Smith.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I still remember seeing this in the theater, and watching it on blu-ray is a nice treat. I admit I'm still not a fan of the Rufio character, but it works. This movie is a lot of fun for the whole family.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I give it zero stars- as my 7 year old said when I asked if he liked it! I fermliy believe many of the positive reviewe were staged! it crashed my fire! plus you can not even close it out! And there are so many in- app purchases! please do not get this game! unless you want to crash your device!  how is this even popular!

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I found this app by luck and I struck gold!  I have  been using this for the past couple of days and I love it. I have been using relaxing/white noise to help sleep for years but this is the best I ever used. the fact that I can basically create my own distinct melodies with just tapping the icons is awesome.<br />I plan on getting the full version also. its worth it!!!
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|With such an important event in history, I would have expected something much, much better than this. By far and large the worst movie I have ever watched, if you can call it a movie. I can't understand Sandra Bullock and Tom hanks putting their names to this albeit for the money they were paid. If anyone remotely likes this \\"movie\\" I can only suggest you must be related to the director or so called story line writer. It doesn't get any sort of rating from me apart from it actually being worse than The New World. Maybe being Australian I have missed something or I'm not a certain part of the \\"field\\". I mean, I dislike Red Dog which is an Aussie movie and supposed to be a smash hit. For me, the three worst movies I have seen this year and in order are Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, The New World and Red Dog.<br />I have at least learnt now to see the movie first before buying it.<br />They're kidding.<br />Stewart,<br />Australia. 17-08-12

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm actually ashamed that I drank the kool-aid. What a terrible book. Everything about it is far-fetched. Every character is more beautiful than than the most beautiful, and Christian Grey--don't get me started! A multi-billionaire in his 20's who has a constant erection, rarely works, and lives in a penthouse with a ton of secret rooms. Embarassingly bad, and now I see it lining the aisles of Target. Obviously directed at non-readers looking for a porn fix and trying to hide it from Mom.
B001974DG0|5.0|Loved this book couldn't put it down and was sorry when I was done reading it the story was so good I wanted it to go on and on.
B005U3V7MC|2.0|Am disappointed in this book.  It has not grabbed me and am having trouble finishing it.<br />Have read other great PD James, but this one is not my favorite.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a stimulating reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes. It retains the essentials, including favorite key phrases, shifting the context to permit a whole new interpretation. Some shifts work better than others, but all are insightful. I particularly liked the interpretation of \\"fall\\" in Reichenbach Falls. Of course, overarching it all is an aggressive view of personality disorders, sibling disorders, and the refreshingly modern interpretation of Moriarty and Watson. Good fun that should add to a rereading of the original tales.
034580404X|3.0|I'm reading the third book now after finishing the first two.  I know these books were bestsellers, but seriously don't understand why.<br />The story is decent, but I found the characters frustrating and somewhat simple.<br />Is it really necessary to fill all three books with endless, graphic sexual encounters?<br />I know some will disagree with my opinion, but less certainly would have been more for me.<br /><br />Without the detailed description of ever sexual encounter, often more than once as the primary character thinks about it, the story probably would have fit nicely in a single book.<br />While I'm enjoying the read, these aren't likely to be keepers for me.  It's not likely that I would want to read them again.<br /><br />Some of the sex is integral to the story and some is welcome, but by the second book I found myself skimming over the repetitive scenes to find the story.<br />They're okay, not what I was expecting from such talked about, bestselling books.<br /><br />Update after finishing the third book:<br />About midway through the last book, the story took a few decent twists and turns and regained my interest.<br />It remained oversaturated with sex, but the rest of the story finally evolved.<br />I found myself liking the series more by the end of the last book.<br />While I still think less would have been more, my overall impression of the story improved.
0446691437|4.0|I thought this was a really good book overall.  \\"Book I\\" goes into procrastination, or \\"resistance\\" as the author calls it, and attempts to turn it into a real, physical enemy.  \\"Book II\\" attempts to fight that enemy by telling you how a professional over comes it.  My only gripe with the book is \\"Book III\\" which gets a little ... out there.  I understand the point he's trying to make ( where creativity comes from ) but the way he does it is a little unbelievable.<br /><br />But for the struggling creative person, the person who wants to take that risk, I would definitely suggest this book.  If you're made that leap and are struggling with getting things done, this book helps explain why.  But if you're looking for more of a \\"getting things done\\" book with actionable steps, I'd get \\"The Now Habit\\" instead.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|This movie reminded me a lot of the Black Beauty movie, but it was just as heartfelt and beautiful as that one, which is my favorite. I highly recommend this movie not only for the story, but for its accurate historical context. I've always known horses can change people's lives.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I decided to read this book because i saw a trailer at the theater for the new film coming of, The Life of Pi, I finished the book with in 48 hours (very fast rate for myself). You cannot read the book without having a aftermath of love and guilt for everything. Love to appriciate what you have now and guilt for what you took for granted. If you do read this book you will have to understamd that there is more than what the book tells you it goes beyond words. You have to think after reading this, how is life special to me?
0345803485|4.0|Ok, it is not the greatest book ever, the writing is poor, it is repetitive, simplistic, immature... But it is a fantasy. It keeps you waiting for the next encounter, it is an easy read, I could not put it down. The story as well as the sex is very unrealistic and kind of corny but how else can a sexual fantasy be? If you are looking for a literary master piece look somewhere else, but if you are looking for some distraction and a little fantasy to keep your imagination going, I say this is a good book for that. Christian Gray is the prime example of what a woman dreams in a man (well except for the deeply troubled and perverted sexual life that he has... Sometimes anyway lol) he is handsome, masculine, billionaire, skilled, confident, smart, aggressive, controlling (in a very deviant but sexy kind of way although he is a little too much). I liked it, and my husband (without reading it) liked it too ;). I am trying to make him a Christian Grey but he is too sweet for that. I'll have to be Christina Grey I guess ;).  Nothing wrong with that. It's a fun read to wake up your imagination :).
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|That is according to my daughter, who despite being a little older, says this is one of her favorites.  It definitely looks and sounds the part, with the voiceover actors doing an excellent job with the leads; and I agree that the digital animation appears top notch, despite being a straight to DVD film (although I read that Disney briefly released it theatrically in LA to qualify for award nominations).
B006UAWH2S|5.0|Like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind meets district 9 meets outbreak meets Melancholia. Couldn't recommend it more. Not overstated. beautifully shot.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A great conclusion to the series. It took me a little longer to get through than the other two, but was still captivating. If you liked the first two books, you will be just as pleased with this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|With free games it's a matter of if it's enjoyable or not, and honestly I can say I enjoyed this app. It's super additive and it actually challenges you to think. Lots of fun!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I enjoy mixing the sounds great to take with u when you need to be away from the comfort of your own home.
B004OKFIYU|1.0|I was thrilled when I saw that Piano Man was re-released on SACD. I could finally enjoy one of my favorite albums in Hi Rez with jet black backgrounds and explosive dynamic range.<br />Wrong!!!!<br />The album sounds like somebody threw a pillow over the microphone. The background isn't silent, it's muffled. The highs don't soar - like they should - they are dead and gone.<br />My old 1998 Columbia version is clearly better for an audiophile. I had to check to make sure I didn't get the discs mixed up.<br />This disc sounds just as bad through my Sennheiser HD800 headphones as my Bosendorfer speakers.<br /><br />On the other hand - the Animals Retrospective SACD album is a treasure if you're looking for a place to spend your money.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|love this. I love being able to change the difficulty settings. works well. never force closed or anything like that.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was quite disappointed with this series after all the hype.  It was one of the most demented \\"love\\" stories I have read.  If I had a daughter, I would tell her to run like mad from this psychotic, possessive, emotionally abusive man.  Maybe it is because my mom worked at a battered woman's shelter when I was growing up...regardless, I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|This is a great cover for the Kindle Fire.  Makes for a nice stand when using the Fire, and the color Purple is very nice.  This is a multi-purpose case with a 4-prong lock to set you Fire for holding and securing.  It has a secure strap to cover the case when closed.  The price is great, you will not be disappointed.<br />Terry
B0086QS7N2|5.0|As usual Rush hits it out of the park with this one.  Wide variety of songs, I hear echos from things/effects of classic Rush albums in some of these songs.  Not bad for a band NOT IN THE R&R HALL OF FAME (how is that even possible?)...
B008MEM24S|4.0|Love this game but it really needs more levels to enjoy. I would give more stars if there were more levels.
B005KELW26|5.0|The tab folio for the Kindle Fire is just the right size and makes handling it much more comfortable and provides safety in the event of a possible drop.  For those who prefer to hold a book while reading, this folio allows one to \\"hold a book\\" although it saves much space in the home since you've either borrowed a book or bought one and have saved it in your digital library.  I'm glad I purchased this item as soon as I got my Kindle!

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I had seen this in regular DVD format before I bought this Blu-Ray. Once I bought a big screen TV and Blu-Ray player, the first movie I though I wanted to see on Blu-Ray was TinTin. This movie did not disapoint. There is a full-lenght movie's worth of extras that were well made, and the quality is amazing. Sound and picture are awesome. The sleeve was glued in the wrong spot, but that is not enough negative to remove a star. Great movie!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I knew that I shouldn't have rented this....I should have bought it!!! And even though I just saw it as a rental, I have since indeed purchased it on Blu Ray. And to those looking to stream this via Instant Video, I hope that the device that you are streaming it to will play it in HD with DTS 5.1 Surround sound. If not, I'd recommend that you stream something else in your queue, and pick this up on DVD or Blu Ray. Because....<br /><br />If you have seen the live show, you may think before viewing this that a DVD could not possibly do justice to something that so captured your heart live on Broadway (or wherever you saw it live). I had the same thought too. I have seen the live show with several different companies on Broadway going all the way back to 1990, and every time I saw the show it affected me unlike any live performance that I have seen to date. From the spectacular stage design, to the talented performers, to the pure emotion emanated from every song, the show took me in, pulled on every heart string and left me dying for more. Now with the DVD I can attest that any preconceived notion that I had about it not living up to the live performance has evaporated.<br /><br />Clearly some of my enchantment with the DVD was because I have seen the show live. The bar is set very high for what I expected out of the performances of the actors/actresses, and ESPECIALLY what I expected from the sound quality and filming direction. And all of my expectations were exceeded!<br /><br />The performances are unforgettable. Any actor/actress looking to play the respective roles of The Phantom and Christine Daa&eacute; has to fill the shoes of original cast members Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman (and the scores of talent that succeeded them). After all, you can have all of the elements in place to put on a Broadway show, but if you don't have the talent that makes you believe and puts everything that they have into their performance...it just won't work. The performances in the 25th Anniversary Celebration show have it all. Most importantly, Sierra Boggess in the role of Christine is outstanding...amazing...beautiful...and unforgettable. And lesser known Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Hadley Fraser as Raoul could have won the lead roles back in 1986. The performances are just phenomenal and the entire cast shines; everyone stands out in their own roles.<br /><br />When seeing a live show the booming sound of the live orchestra behind the performers contributes heavily to a memorable experience. The sound on the DVD is perfected and presented in DTS Surround where if you have a home theater that plays in 5.1 or better and you crank up the volume...well, you will think that you are literally at the live show. If you're adamant about streaming this instead of getting the DVD, you'd probably get satisfactory 2.0 sound using a pair of headphones, but this really is a big screen production and you will appreciate it more watching it in HD on a large flat screen.<br /><br />And finally, as far as the film direction for this performance...the camera was right where you would want it to be at every moment. Long, perfect angles for each shot with no inappropriate jumping around. The camera moved as if it were your own eyes moving to where they would move if you were in one of the first few rows of the show.<br /><br />As somewhat of a bonus, at the end of the show after the cast takes their bows, Andrew Lloyd Webber comes out for a bow too, and thanks everyone involved in the production going back to the beginning. The highlight being when he brings out Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. Webber says that Brightman has agreed to sing, and she proceeds to perform Phantom of the Opera with several of the past Phantoms....except for Crawford! Word is that Crawford didn't sing because he had just finished performing in a matinee of The Wizard of Oz at the London Palladium...Um...so?!? If there was a disappointment in this package, that wasthe only one.<br /><br />So do not make the same mistake that I did with viewing Phantom's 25th Anniversary Celebration. I rented it. Don't rent it....Buy it! It now sits prominently along side the other music and arts DVDs in my collection.nly one.<br /><br />So do not make the same mistake that I did with viewing Phantom's 25th Anniversary Celebration.

0307744434|1.0|Seriously, did I pick up the wrong book?  I had to have picked up the wrong book.  The one that I intended to read was a book about an intriguing magical circus, dueling magicians, and a romantic love affair.  You know, I'm talking about the book that was so highly rated by many, many, many reviewers.<br /><br />Quite honestly, this is the worst book I have ever read.  The book was so bad that I had to write a review about it.  I have read thousands of books and have never been compelled to write a review.  In fact, this is the first one I have ever written.<br /><br />The book was so incredibly boring.  After about 50 pages, I wanted to poke my eyes out.  But, since I had to read the book for my book club, I kept plugging along.  The characters were so flat - no dimension to them at all.  There was nothing in the book to help me get to know the characters, nor did I care what happened to them.  I was confused about this supposed competition most of the way through.  There were no rules or purpose for anything the characters did.  Nothing moved the story along - each chapter was more of the same crap that you had already read.<br /><br />I won't even go into the grammatical errors or tense changes.  I don't pretend to be a writer or know all of the rules, but I think an English teacher would have set fire to this crappy book.<br /><br />The utter lack of character development, plot, suspense, and romance made this book very difficult to get through.  The ending was as disappointing as the rest and made about as much sense as the rest of the book.  I can not even begin to understand what people thought was so \\"magical\\" about it.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book is very boring. Has a lot of sex that was written in book one and two and repeated in three. It shows that this book was written by a beginner writer.  A complete waste of money.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book reads like a romance novel. Except it has a lot of sex written pages. I did not like this book, because it was boring. I like a story to have a plot. This book does not have a plot. The only page turner about this book is wishing to come to the end soon.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|The \\"film\\" approach to this movie is ingenious as much as it is off-putting. I can see where the erratic film-style could make one person hate the movie and feel like their about to have a seizure, while another person feels hypnotized.<br /><br />What I mean by \\"film\\" approach is the unnerving bizarre angles, jarring music and sound at odd moments, color distortion to frames of the movie, skewed and unexplained timeline, very little talking from actors, etc. These in my opinion are all Hallmarks of a \\"film\\" not a movie.<br />Because of this my husband hated \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin.\\" I on the other hand, thought the \\"film\\" approach made things unnerving and uncomfortable for the viewer..... which is EXACTLY how you need to feel watching the material you are watching. The content of the movie is intensely disturbing so the combined effect is genious.<br /><br />The bouncing back and forth with flashbacks, screaming child - then quiet seemingly evil child, violent and raw behaviors, lack of communication between the parents - it is all meant to leave you with frayed nerves so that you can't swallow what is happening to Tilda Swinton's character any more than she can. It builds you up climactically too as you discover the horror of what Kevin does - while seeing that no one did anything to stop it, and debating with yourself if there was anything that could ever have been done.<br /><br />After the movie was over, I felt uncomfortable and disturbed. My normal life and everything around me felt so quiet and slow - after what I had just seen : quick flashes/auditory assault/jarring content all jumbled together. The effect was tangible.  I didn't like feeling that way....... but I have to admit that the directors and Tilda Swinton did an astounding job to have left me with such a lasting impression and effect.<br /><br />This is not a movie you watch over and over. But it is a disturbing film that is thought provoking and discussion worthy..... if you can stomach it's odd but effective film style.s odd but effective film style.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|I am still in the middle of this fascinating book (40% point of the Kindle).  I really like the explanation of Level 5 leaders that \\"embody all five layers of the pyramid.\\"  \\"Humility + Will = Level 5\\" is a concept that most people don't realize.  I have worked with many CEO's who never made it to Level 5 because they are so charmed by their own power and sense of superior decision making that they make costly mistakes.<br /><br />In addition, I like the Hedgehog Concept as a strategy for core business success.  Develop and focus on a very simple concept to be used as a frame of reference for decisions.  The simple concept is based on three key dimensions  -- what can you be best at, what drives your economic engine (the single factor that drives profit), and what are you \\"deeply passionate about.\\"<br /><br />And another great concept that a lot of companies should follow but don't -- \\"get the right people on the bus and the wrong people off!\\"  There's a lot more, but I will continue reading the book and add onto my review later.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|This movie is awesome, and if all you want to do is to watch the movie this edition is just fine. The picture and sound are great, and you can choose between the theatrical and extended special editions, as well as a third cut that has two more deleted scenes (including a different happy ending) if you enter a code (82997) in the menu.<br /><br />Where this edition fails is with the special features. The packaging advertises 8 hours of features, but it's a complete lie. Those features are not on the disc, they're on the internet. If your player isn't connected to the internet, you'll never see them. From reading other reviews, however, it seems that disconnecting your player from the internet does give you a better experience with this Bluray, because it prevents the painfully long loading process as \\"Skynet\\" takes control of your player.<br /><br />Despite the low cost of this edition, if another Bluray edition is available with the extended cut of the film and with special features actually on-disc and in the box, then that other edition would be the version I recommend.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|When listening to sounds its all good... and then it is complete silence and then sounds and silence. Every sound has a pause between the loops. There should be no pause, it sucks! The rest is nice and easy to use. There are a couple sounds that the pause is not as noticeable because the sound naturally becomes quieter, like the purring and the wind chimes.
1469984202|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This book will be a classic sci fi read one day. Would also make a great film! Strong female protagonist is a plus. The only thig I hope is that this story is not the end.
B00846REIS|4.0|Read this and other reviews at Madison Says {dot} com.<br /><br />If you're having a difficult time moving on after reading Fifty Shades, this is a great first step for the erotic romance alone. However, as you will probably read in any other reviews of this book - it is incredibly similar - right down to to the cover. Bared to You comes from the same publishing house that picked up Fifty Shades, and for that reason, it is assumed they are sort of lumping them together - which makes it appear as a rip off. I don't think that's the case, although, there are plenty of similarities. The most obvious similarities are this: mega rich, hot and dominant male with serious boundary issues meets naive girl with super nosy roommate.<br /><br />Gideon Cross has specific tastes and when he meets Eva Tramell he gets right to what he's looking for. Both characters have major demons in their pasts - those demons become more in the forefront when they try to navigate a new relationship with one another. The relationship they do have, though, is hot. hot. hot. Like scorching! They are troubled, sexy and super passionate people. What I really loved was the fact that Ms. Day gave Eva strength. She stuck up for herself and was a strong chick. She wasn't afraid of Gideon and had her own voice. I really appreciated that in the tortured heroine character. She knew her weaknesses, but that didn't stop her from having her strengths! With Gideon - there's not much to say. Hot, rich, tortured. Sounds like a winning combo to me ;).<br /><br />I am excited for the next installment in this trilogy to come out in October. I am guessing it'll be even better than the first. I feel like a lot was left untold in the first book. There was a lack of climactic energy (no pun intended, ha) in this one that I am sure will be coming in book two. Please know that this book is not Fifty Shades and if you go into it expecting that, you will be disappointed. Ms. Day created her own characters with a different storyline and it's a great story, when taken as it's own. While it does contain the same sort of erotic presence as Fifty Shades it is NOTFifty Shades. :)<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to mature adults looking for a hot, sex-filled, erotic and intense love story. The storyline is great and keeps you intrigued and the characters are multi-dimensional and definitely very hot, but also super complicated ! I can't wait to see what happens next with them!<br /><br />And keep your eye out for my review of Reflected in You in early October. I'm sure it won't disappoint!toryline and it's a great story, when taken as it's own.

0307730697|5.0|Absolutely outstanding.  A great tribute to a real American hero.  I don't think these guys get the recognition they deserve.  A very good look at the power of the human spirit.  In our society today, this is the sort of book that should be required reading in school instead of some of the useless \\"classics.\\"  As a society, we have lost sight of the important things, but this book helps bring some of that back into focus.

0071762345|5.0|After hearing Dave Kerpen's awesome talk at WOMMA last spring, I couldn't wait to read more. Packed with crisp case studies and easy-to-implement tips, his book delivered. In fact, I'm now on my third or fourth copy, having given it away several times to friends and clients. I always make sure to replace it, though---it's an essential part of my tightly curated marketing/business library.<br /><br />Lots has been written already, so here's a visual recap of my top takeaways from Dave's book, which I created using Haiku Deck: [...]<br />I can also add that Dave himself is one of the most likeable guys in the business---incredibly committed, yet delightful to talk to. Thanks for helping make the world a more likeable place, Dave!

B008B3GP2A|5.0|This album is awesome and it truly lives up to its name because I have played it over and over again there are so many good songs.  I am hoping that with so much material radio will not drive one particular song into the ground like they did with Jaegger.  Great pop album, if you like pop music you will love this album.

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|well there is nothing more to say .. you get it for 78 $ with nice packaging .. but take care the 250 version requires a masterful skill to take pictures with .. as on the largest magnification and zoom level depth of field is like a hair .. you also need a wireless flash or a ring flash or sunny daylight .. focus distance with the 55 250 is like 20 - 30 cm

B004LWZWBU|5.0|If you enjoy movies with charm that are somewhat mellow in nature and would like a change from the foul-mouthed, overly gratuitous \\"adventures\\" Hollywood generally puts out, then I believe you will like this one.  I rented this movie because of the main actors involved.  I've enjoyed each of them in various films and was intrigued with a story involving all three together.  I expected to laugh, which I did.  What I didn't expect but enjoyed immensely was how easy going and clean this was.  In a Hollywood culture where sex, violence, and crudeness reign sensationally, it was refreshing to see something that was more down-to-earth and realistic.  Like another reviewer, I have watched this more than once.  It's a bit of a feel-good antidote to stress for me.  I also learned some things; if you are not a \\"birder\\", you will too.  It's just one of those feel-good movies that is easy to watch unless you really don't enjoy the less action-packed genres.

B0059XTUVI|1.0|When your subject has the distinction of being the UK's first female and longest-serving prime minister, whose administration made a big impact on her country during tumultuous times, making an interesting movie about that person's life ought to be a piece of cake whether you agree or disagree with her politics. Instead, whoever made \\"The Iron Lady\\" has done the impossible. They succeeded in making Margaret Thatcher's life story boring.<br /><br />It's a schizophrenic film about an elderly woman suffering from dementia with brief little bits and pieces of her formative years and political career thrown in at random.  I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this. Maybe they wanted to spread the gloomy message that accomplishing great things doesn't matter because you'll end up old, helpless, and forgotten anyway?  Maybe they wanted to recreate for their audience the confused thoughts of people with dementia? Or maybe they hired Edward Scissorhands to do the film editing because he needed a job? Anyway, all the jumping back and forth was confusing, then I got bored enough not to care.<br /><br />If your objective is to get some idea of what Margaret Thatcher was all about, you'd be better off (and more entertained) watching videos of her speeches on YouTube or reading a biography.  But if you have insomnia and your objective is to find an alternative to sleeping pills or counting sheep, then you should buy this movie.<br /><br />The one star I gave was for Meryl Streep's performance.  She was very convincing as Margaret Thatcher--looked like her, sounded like her.  Streep's talent was wasted on this movie.  What I saw of the other actors was also good, but none of them was onscreen long enough to really establish their characters.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Avatar is finally available on 3d blu ray and you do not have to purchase a Panasonic TV and Blu-Ray player to own this. Excellent 3d effects - this is the movie that made me buy my first 3d TV. Although not the most original plot (in my opinion only) The 3D effects make up for this.  I was able to see the panasonic version 3D with a friend and truly enjoyed this movie. Now this release does not contain the EXTENDED VERSION that everyone seems to want.  Yes, after waiting all this time, we deserve the extended version. BUT those of us who HAVE this 3D version and are upset that there is no extended version on Blu- Ray either 1.Paid for the Panasonic 3D television and have the starter kit. 2. Got ripped off paying 200 dollars on Ebay for this movie, or 3. found a boot-leg copy somewhere.  I am giving this movie 4 stars (would be 5 stars, but again the plot wasn't as original as the special effects).  Now I will probably get \\"ripped\\" on for my review, to be honest, I could NOT afford the Panasonic 3D television, and had to settle for the 720p Samsung 3D television. Myself and many other people were out of luck!  Now that we have a release that everyone can afford this review goes out to everyone like myself who want to have a \\"fair\\" price for buying a movie. You could also look at this release as \\"double dipping\\", and you could look at it as James Cameron wanting to get rich off of everyone.  Well name one director/producer/studio who doesn't want to make money on re-releases. When we see Avatar PART 9 come out, then complain! (haha)  For those of us who waited (and are broke), Our time has come! BUY THIS MOVIE!! It's worth every penny!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Rush have taken their time having put together \\"Clockwork Angels\\" over the course of the past several years.  The first two tracks \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" were both released as internet singles more than two years ago and have been a part of their live show for the same time period.  Both tracks have been slightly improved here with some added flourishes not found in the originals.  To my ears Rush has been on a bit of a creative comeback of late.  I thought their last album \\"Snakes And Arrows\\" was their best in years, and \\"Clockwork\\" continues moving in the right direction.  All of Rush strengths are shown here revolving around a concept that will be eventually expanded into a novel.  This album took a few listens to really click with me, but I am really enjoying it now.  There are a few tracks here, (\\"Headlong Flight\\" is a good example) which rate right up there with the best the band has ever done.  Instrumentally the band, as always, is still on fire with all three guys showing off their chops throughout the disc.  Geddy's vocals have changed a bit over the years, but he still has good range and can belt it out.  My one criticism with the production is the sound.  As with many modern albums, everything is compressed to death and comes out muddy on my system.  One thing you do not want on a Rush album is muddy sounding drums, and unfortunately they are nearly as clear and crisp as they should be.  Hell, some of the band's old 70's albums sound better than this.  Other than the sound issue I think this is a very strong release from Rush.  These guys defiantly still have it.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the series and sincerely wish I hadn't. After reading the first book all I can say is it is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life. It takes feminism back about 100 years and the fact that it is so incredibly popular amongst women is...frightening to say the least.

B00466H3F4|5.0|My nieces, 5 year old twins, spend every other Saturday with me and I'm careful to make sure they watch movies approved by their parents.  Babe had parental approval.  I bought this and it arrived while they were at my place.  I popped it in and they absolutely loved it - the dogs, the sheep, the mice, and most of all, Babe.  It was wonderful to watch with them the way I had with my three sons.  My brother and sister-in-law said that the girls now go around saying 'That'll do, pig, that'll do' to their cats and dog.
0451450523|5.0|Fans of the animated film should definitely read this book. I was very impressed with the way it was an adult novel, with more adult themes, but younger people and children would still be able to read it. Very, very good.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|An interesting read on a situation that few understood or even now understand.  I haven't read any other books on the subject, so I can't compare to others.  The personalities covered were interesting and their stories were well told.  I would recommend as a view into a world most don't know exists.
B007549W62|4.0|From the perspective of what the produces wanted to convey I think this movie did it.  It certainly portrayed what might happen in a post nuclear situation.  I found it very disturbing and I am sure that is what it was meant to be.  The acting was well done and the dialog realistic.  I can only say that it is not for the faint at heart.  I am not a fan of this type movie because they seem to be very depressing and this was but it kept my interest nonetheless.  I wanted to turn it off yet I didn't.  If you are someone that likes really intense apocalyptic movies this one is a good one to watch.
030758836X|4.0|*No Spoilers*<br /><br />If you haven't heard of this book, then you're ignoring it on purpose because it's everywhere and lots and lots of people are talking about it including Reese Witherspoon who hopes to produce the movie.<br /><br />So, what's it about? Why the hype?<br /><br />Technically, it's about Nick and Amy Dunne and how their marriage goes very, very wrong. It's about control and the loss of control and the ability for two people to go from happily married, to anything but. It's manipulation turned up as high as it will go and it's riveting.<br /><br />Riveting.<br /><br />Absolutely riveting.<br /><br />However, it was also one of the most ridiculous plots I have ever read. I mean, when you hear that this book is \\"all kinds of crazy\\" they aren't kidding. I think everything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong and then even cycled back around to repeat some stuff that wasn't fully played out the first time around. This book is crazy on a stick!<br /><br />I was happy with it halfway through, because every time I picked it up, my eyes were glued to the page and nothing else mattered. But after the halfway point, I found myself thinking that Ms. Flynn was just fooling with me. She dropped red herrings everywhere and threw in some really incredible things for shock value but none of it, NONE OF IT surprised me and most of the time I could even see it coming.<br /><br />I think this book is doing well for many reasons. One, Flynn can write. Two, when everyone says it's crazy, you've gotta to know why. Three, it's fun to be on the other side of crazy, where you can watch this train wreck unfold from the comfort of your home and not have to know these people in real life. Four, it's a page-turner and for its entertainment alone, it's worth the price you pay for it.<br /><br />So, I have mixed feelings about it. I liked it for its entertainment value and I liked being able to discuss it with others who have already read it. There is a lot to discuss with this one. However, it didn't surprise me or wow me or even shock me. It was predictable and parts of it were so ridiculous that I sprained my eyeballs rolling them.<br /><br />I got to thinking though, there's nothing wrong with an entertaining read. This is a book that will keep your mind off of the smelly person sitting next to you on the train and when the movie comes out, I'm sure I'll see it.this one.

B008M34INW|5.0|If you don't like Mel Gibson for what has happened offscreen the last few years, I understand. If that makes it impossible for you to enjoy viewing one of his movies. I understand as well. However, you'd be doing yourself a favor by putting those feelings aside and watching this movie.<br />In-spite of the less than favorable press he has earned for himself, his latest two movies might be his best ever. I enjoyed the depth he showed in \\"The Beaver,\\" and now with this movie, he goes another step into greatness. Obviously this required a different performance that \\"the Beaver,\\" but the end result is the same. He is one of the five most watchable performers ever. If you enjoy being entertained, this movie is for you.
0767903862|5.0|This is a very funny, well written and very informative book which I really enjoyed especially since I will be making my first trip to Australia very soon.  Highly recommended.  The author travels all over the country and offers some very useful and interesting information about Down Under, its cities and the Outback, in a country that is somewhat unfamiliar to many Americans, including its history, extreme climate, and dangerous but exotic and unique living creatures.  Australia is home to the friendliest people on earth, the most extreme climates on earth, and also the most lethal creatures on earth, and these perceptions are described in a very sincere and sometimes hilarious manner.  Loved it.
B007FLHW3K|1.0|The wiring failed after just one week of using, or approximately 80 miles of commuting in NYC. The roads here can be pretty rough (bumpy), so that may have had something to do with it. Still, if I pay $50 for a product, I expect it to be built so that there are no failing parts. Buyer beware.<br /><br />Power no longer flows from the battery pack to the light, unless I physically hold the wires at a very acute angle. As soon as I release, the power stops flowing.

1935251740|3.0|Biocentrism makes the case, based on the findings of quantum mechanics, that nothing exists unless we observe it. In extremis, this means that when you leave the office at night it ceases to exist and is reconstituted when you come back and see it again. In other words, all reality is subjective in the sense that it exists only when we observe it.<br /><br />The author is a physician and a very intelligent and thoughtful person. However, it is something of a stretch to think that California does not exist unless I (or someone else presumablty) is there to observe it. It has been conclusively established as the author repeatedly points out that at the quantum scale there is a basis for this line of reasoning. Those familiar with the Heisenberg principle, that the act of observation effects that which is observed, and the various experiments with particles and photons proving that, at this level, a particle is in what is called a \\"superposition\\", that is it is neither here nor there until an observation defines its position, will be better prepared  to make the leap of thinking required to accept the author's postulates.<br /><br />However, he never addresses the question of the existince of multiple consciousnesses. If California isnt here unless I observe it, I must not be here unless some biological consciousness observes me. Was the world here when an amoeba could sense it? When I am gone, will the universe go with me? Or will the concsiousnesses of the billions of other sentient entities on earth suffice to preserve its form? Before we had telescopes, were the distant galaxies not there?<br /><br />I think the implications of quantum physics actually argue more forcefully for a sort of cosmic consciousness that senses all and observes all, which sounds portentuously theological. Then of course comes the question of who or what observes that observer so that it continues to exist. Perhaps that's our job, and why religion seems so persistent in spite of all the efforts of science to explain it away. As I grow older, it seems to me that science sounds a more and more uncertain trumpet as it delves deeper and deeper into the mysteries of such things as quantum physics. Perhaps there is more to reaity than meets the eye, even the scientific one.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Anastasia was too nieve. She acted as a small child not 21. It is unfitting, given what the book is about. I would have liked her to be a stronger character. Christian is, well, ridiculous. Billionaire talented at everything. The story is far reaching and out of a teenager's juvenile mind. It was repetitive: the characters, the sex scenes, the conversations. Media hype makes the sex seem so much darker than what it is. I say this book is fair. It would have been better with mature characters, a more relatable story, and less repetition.

0985114606|2.0|This book was good, but it was practically the same as 50 shades! I cannot believe the similarities between the two.. Gideon Cross/Christian Grey (same initials just switched round), Eva/Ana, Cary/Kate, Angus/Taylor, Magdalen/Mrs. Robinson, Corinne/Leila, Mark/Jack (names are similar even though they are two different people), Eva is an assistant, Cross has a haunting past and nightmares, everyone is wealthy and gorgeous. Eva's parents are split and her mom married money, the list can go on and on. It was still well written, and I'll probably read the next one to see if it is any different, but i doubt it will.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I regret buying it almost immediately. I read up to about 14%, based on my Kindle, and I am damn proud of myself for getting so far.<br />I didn't like Twilight that much. This is really, very alike Twilight, but with different setting and characters' names.<br />The main character was so, so much like Bella - weakwilled, very clumsy, inexperienced in almost everything but reading, blushes like crazy, and taciturn. I don't know what Christian Grey sees in her. Her character is just plain annoying. It's repetitive. Her \\"inner voice\\" is very annoying.<br />I think the only thing I like about this book is Grey. I could see why he's very attractive to many women. I could also see why Twilight fans who fawn over him; he's Edward except not a virgin, does not sparkle, and makes wicked innuendos.<br /><br />Personally, I like my main character to be more strong-willed than this. So, I couldn't get through it. I am sorry I bought it.<br /><br />Please check out \\"Bared to You.\\" It's similar to 50 Shades, but both the main characters are more developed than this. And they are mature.

145162607X|3.0|Phillipa Gregory has handled a muddled history with unexpected orgiginality. When The Kingmaker's Daughter came out, I was excited but equally hesitant to read it. From reading Philippa's other books, I felt she would handle the story of Anne and Isabel in one of two ways. The first was to make Anne and Isabel anachronistically independent, and the second was to make them absolute pushovers. While Philippa did make use of that worn-out anaology of medieval women acting like pawns in a chessgame, she also made Anne and Isabel seem realistic, with a few exceptions. I was also impressed by the way Philippa treated such characters as George of Clarence and Richard III because her characterization of them was, if not totally new, at least different from the majority of Wars of the Roses novels on the market these days. Overall, my chief complaint in regards to this novel was, in my opinion, the poor writing and a certain lack of consistency which hindered an otherwise enjoyable story.<br /><br />In Kingmaker's Daughter, Gregory's writing seems almost like a parody of itself. The simple, slightly ominous and foreboding style that served her so well before became heavy-handed. In one sentence, she describes Edward IV as \\"glorious\\" twice, and this is only one example of her constant repition of overblown adjectives and phrases. Despite all these adjectives, I felt the writing did not serve to set an atmosphere or setting for the novel. It was clunky and amateurish, and since I know Philippa can do better from her other novels, I can't help but feel that the writing in Kingmaker's Daughter is simply the product of laziness, either on Philippa's part or her editor's. In general, the caliber of writing seems to decrease with each of her releases, specifically the books in the Cousin's War series.<br /><br />For me, the second half of the book was what made it a worthwhile read. Despite the writing even, the second half was suspensful and exciting,even for someone who knows the history and can therefore be considered \\"spoiled\\" as to the events in the novel. As I mentioned before, Philippa's take on George of Clarence, Richard III, and what happened between Warwick's death and Richard III's kingship, was refreshing and unexpected. I wish this had been so throughout the novel, for the first half seems to be an entirely different novel than the second! George of Clarence from the first half is a totally different character from the second half. Isabel's characterization was also confusing and the proposed motives for her behavoir lacked the ring of believability. I also don't think that Warwick, for being such an important figure, was given enough space on the page.<br /><br />All things considered, it wasn't a bad novel. I liked it infinitely better than The Red Queen. I finished it in a day, and it held my attention, but I think there was a greater potential here that failed to be met. 3/5history and can therefore be considered \\"spoiled\\" as to the events in the novel.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I am very in between with this book. Gillian Flynn does have a very unique writing style. There was something psychologically wrong with the main characters (which is the point). It is the first book I have read and did not like the main characters, but it made it more interesting to read.<br /><br />It did start out slow for me but after you got a hang of how it's written, you are hooked all the way to the very end. The ending was definitely a let down for me but I read it over and over and realize the creepy vibe you get from Amy. *SPOILER ALERT* Nick finally said something that got to her. Amy playing her mind games, playing the hero, and after all the things she has done, she feels somewhat guilt in the end. It's not as of a great ending if you don't think about it. Possibly people wanted more action, or some \\"great\\" future. Or maybe for Nick to \\"win\\" Amy's mind games. I wouldn't know what kind of ending I would have wanted since I don't like Nick or Amy, but if you think about the ending, it makes sense. However, I do crave more.<br /><br />This book definitely messed with me. It was very out there and bizarre, but that's what kept me reading.
1609611543|5.0|Two years ago at the age of 51, I was diagnosed with heart failure and was told I would need a transplant.  But, I was dying so quickly that instead they implanted an LVAD (left ventricular assist device).  I became obsessed with finding answers as to why this happened to me and how to reverse the situation.  I was able to do so and have written about it in my own book, \\"One Percent: My Journey Overcoming Heart Disease.\\" .[[ASIN:1600476694 One Percent: My Journey Overcoming Heart Disease]] But as I've continued reading, one topic which has come up repeatedly is inflammation - it is the start of heart disease, cancer, alzheimers, arthritis and other maladies.  So although there are ways to deal with the inflammation, what is the source?  In reading this book and others, I now know that wheat, soy and corn - the three staples of the American diet, all are gentically modified foods and cause havoc to our bodies, much like processed sugars.  As I continue to read this book my mouth continues to hang open as if I have finally located the holy grail.  I still take a wide array of nutrients, but wonder how many are still necessary considering all of the other nutrient-dense foods I eat and especially since I've now eliminated wheat.  Yes, I did lose 5 pounds rather quickly, but I am not particularly overweight to begin with and weight loss is not why I am recommending this book.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book and \\"Nourishing Traditions\\" by Sally Fallon to begin a nutional path back to optimal health[[ASIN:0967089735 Nourishing Traditions:  The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats]]

B008BM9L72|1.0|To be honest I was not expecting much from the books, I only purchased them as nearly everyone in work was reading them & I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I got about halfway through the first book before I gave up hoping it was going to improve. They are very poorly written and the thin plot is entirely predictable. I couldn't in all honestly recommend them to anyone. In short, do not waste your money or time on this excuse for a book!

B00005JKJA|1.0|When it first came out, I was enthralled, or should I say, seduced by the movie, but not for substantial reasons.  Two viewings later, I have no desire ever to waste time on its utter pretentiousness again. I would rather visit the Salvation Army than that kinky downtown theatre dive bathed in the color red.  I was suckered,yes. This over-reach turns out to be a stilted exercise in ill-wrought  symbolism, too much of it feeling distant and abstract, the entire affair confusingly nonsensical.  Perhaps if I really understood the obtuse plot line, were that even possible, I might recant.  I have no desire to try.  The movie fails, I believe, because of its lack of realistic specificity; it is a con.  Lynch, straining for creativity (what a grand imposter he is) stoops to trying to appropriate \\"Day of the Locust\\" end-point imagery.  But this film can't begin to compare to the brilliantly realistic Locust, which is possibly the finest film ever made about Hollywood. What did I like the most about Mullholand Drive?  Ann Miller.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I have always been a fan of the King Arthur Legend. I own movie versions dating back to the 1950's (Knights of the Round Table), the 1960's (Camelot, the musical), 1980's (Excalibur) 1990's (First Knight). Even though I am not a TV series person, I could not resist Eva Green and Joseph Fiennes in this well done version re-telling the story with a few believable twists. The acting is superb, and the photography as well and production values are excellent. The Blu-rays are very sharp in 16:9. I wish they had a PANAVISION aspect ratio of 2.35:1, but these were filmed for HD TV, and not for theatrical release. If you like the legend, you will enjoy watching  this new millennium version of the classic tale.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is a great exercise in taking a handful of topics to illustrate how reality varies greatly from common paradigms.  It helped me realize that many of the decisions made by individuals and institutions are based on incomplete or faulty perceptions of what is really happening.  It is also humbling to recognize that much of success is better explained by chance or circumstance than by the illusion of the \\"self made man\\".  All of this is written in a style easy to read.  I've recommended this book to many friends. You might also enjoy \\"You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself\\" by David McRaney (Oct 27, 2011)
B004I1K2NW|4.0|I first saw this movie only because I had purchased the soundtrack (score by Danny Elfman) and thought the original cover art was interesting. Was I ever surprised by this film. It's a great blend of supernatural horror mixed with comedy and a whodunnit all in one. The special effects are top-notch, and I believe at the time of the film's release it was the most effects ever in one film. It has a great cast all around, from Michael J. Fox to John Astin to Dee Wallace Stone to Jeffrey Combs.<br /><br />My original DVD of this film errored out during the last half hour of the film, so I am very pleased to now own a Blu-Ray release as a replacement. And a director's cut, no less! Thanks, Peter Jackson, for this fun, underrated and underviewed movie.

B0085G0DH6|5.0|Recorded live in Japan in 1979 with the European Quartet, Garbarek, Danielsson and Chrisensen, is probably the best album of this Quartet. They have only two studio albums, \\"Belonggin\\" and \\"My song\\" and another two life, \\"Nude ants\\" and Personal Mountains\\". This two are recorded in 1979 with only weeks of diferecence. This one, \\"Sleeper\\" is the best probably because the sound mix is better. In any case this is a wonderful album, with incredible versions and with Jarret an Garbarek in perfect harmony. My only question is why ECM have wait so long time to present this real jewel. A great performance that today sound better than ever.1979 was the year for the European Quartet. Don't miss it

0374203032|1.0|Is money the root of all evil?<br /><br />In truth it was one of our greatest inventions. Barter works fine if each party has something the other wants. Otherwise, it's far handier if you can sell your stuff for cash you can use to buy anything. This enabled the division of labor, with people specializing in professions - one of civilization's killer apps.<br /><br />However, Sandel decries a world where it seems everything is for sale; he doesn't want poor people selling kidneys to rich ones, for example. Many would indeed see an \\"ick\\" factor here.<br /><br />But that ignores the fundamental logic, and virtue, of all market transactions: people buy and sell to each other only when it makes both better off. You can argue (as does Sandel) that the impoverished kidney seller is not really a free agent in the transaction because his poverty leaves him little choice. Perhaps so. But this is condescending elitism of the worst sort.<br /><br />Nobody is ever totally free; everything we do or choose is constrained by a myriad of factors - economic, social, cultural, psychological, physical. Poverty is just one such constraint. Still we try to do what improves our circumstances. Thus the kidney peddler may be constrained by dire poverty, but given that reality, he judges that selling the kidney will improve his situation. He needs the money more than the kidney. Where does philosopher Sandel get off telling him he shouldn't be allowed to make that choice for himself? And what about the other guy who may die if he can't buy the kidney? Do Sandel's moral scruples leave either of them better off? No, they do not.<br /><br />In fairness, Sandel effectively argues that allowing such sales is bad for society; and that's a legitimate concern. Certainly society may limit freedoms that harm third parties. But are kidney sales anybody's business but the buyer and seller? Well, you might argue that a society permitting this is in some sense a worse society for everyone. That selling kidneys for money somehow uglifies society, or somehow degrades human life, etc.; again, the gut's \\"ick\\" response. But these are all subjective judgments with no basis other than feeling. Not good enough.<br /><br />To feel there's something inherently grubby about selling anything for money is an irrational prejudice. The existence and use of money is a good thing, not bad. Ability to buy and sell things makes people more free. That's why it's called a free market. It means having more opportunities to engage in exchanges that make people better off - and kidney sales are in fact a perfect example. Anything that hinders such transactions makes people worse off. If you disallow kidney sales, the seller can't ameliorate his poverty, and the other fellow will die (the ultimate in being worse off).<br /><br />Sandel has forgotten what may be the first principle of moral philosophy: whether something is good or bad depends on how it affects the well-being of creatures capable of feeling. The parties to the kidney sale strike a deal because it improves well-being for both. It may put Sandel's sensitive moral nose out of joint; but I don't see how his personal feelings come into the matter at all.idneys for money somehow uglifies society, or somehow degrades human life, etc.; again, the gut's \\"ick\\" response.

B004R5XMDG|1.0|I do not recommend this product.  I am very interested in the background of Barack Obama and have read several different biographies, so I was interested in hearing Obama read his own book.  I had read the print version of his autobiography and was very interested in hearing several portions of the book read in the author's own voice.  I was very disappointed to find that the audio book was heavily edited to remove any section that might be politically embarrassing to the author. For example, in the original Obama autobiography there was much written on his visits to Kenya and his interaction with his relatives and family homes. In the audio book this part of his original book was edited to the point of being non-existent and the family and geographic ties expressed so strongly in the original book had been removed. If you are after a \\"feel good\\" book about our president this will fill the bill, but if you are after an understanding of the feelings of Obama toward his family and the country of his forefathers, read the print version of the book.  For a follow on to the print version, I would recommend reading the Dinesh D'Souza book, \\"The Roots of Obama's Rage\\". The D'Souza book develops the Obama-Kenya ties and gives a plausible framework for Obama's actions in later life.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Read more:  [...]    The Basics: It's not difficult to tell why this book has been blowing up the book blog world. Hamilton has an ear for pretty descriptions and a head for an exciting, twisty plot. Nothing is as it seems in the world of Sophia Parsons. Just when you think you understand the game, everything shifts. I really enjoyed the Sophia and Charles romance--very sweet and well done, and if you're more of a romance fan than me, you'll adore it even more! The supporting cast was a little sporadic, but all the characters felt fully realized. Even through a few draggy bits that could have been cut, I was fascinated by the fantasy world Hamilton has created. It's a take on vampires like you've never seen before, plus a whole host of clever mythological hybrids that I couldn't get enough of.    Plot (3/5): Most of the time, I was paging through quickly, excited for the next piece. The twists keep you guessing; this is anything but predictable! Especially during the first half and the last half. Only a few parts dragged. One, I thought the romance between Sophia and Charles got too intense too quickly. But other than that, I thought their progression was sweet and I really enjoyed them together. Also, I liked hearing Ivory's story but it was just too long right in the middle of intense action. The ending could have been shorter too. I didn't really need the slow denouement.    Concept (5/5): One of the most clever takes on vampires I've seen. Hamilton sets up a world of elementals that gels perfectly with the Wiccan backdrop and ties in lots of fun mythology. I thought her stories of the Universe and the creations of the elementals were brilliant! Original, very well thought-out, and they just had this atmosphere of magical-ness. Top notch.    Characters (5/5): I love Sophia. Even when she annoyed me, it was in an, \\"Oh, you silly girl\\" endearing way. She felt like a friend by the end. Charles is a nice break from Mr. Controlling. He had a few moments of being too domineering, but in the end, he let Sophia do her own thing and helped her grow. Some of the side characters didn't get a lot of play time, but I still felt like I knew them quite well. Mrs. Franklin was an eerily fantastic addition.    Style (4/5): Hamilton's writing is largely very pretty and very clear. I could imagine everything extremely well. She has a great sense of atmosphere, which is important in any book. Only, there were too many adjectives for my taste. I didn't really need to know the exactly color or texture or brand of everything. I didn't need everything to be stripped out, either. Sometimes, a very detailed description is a great accent. I just didn't like so much of it.    Mechanics (5/5): A couple typos, but nothing that I noticed more than in passing. The book is very well formatted in general. Hamilton has a great sense of grammar, which always makes me smile. Yeah, I'm a grammar nazi. Deal with it.    Take Home Message: An exciting, fresh take on supernaturals with its own mythology. Must-read for any fans of the paranormal.
B00005R24G|5.0|Forget about the misguided, insipid remake (ironically, starring Michael Caine in the original Olivier role) and just pray, if you haven't already seen this original version or do not know anyone who has it, that it will soon be rereleased. A film about games and one-upsmanship, no description of the plot (without numerous spoilers for those unfamiliar with the story) can even begin to do this film justice. Even having seen the play and knowing all the twists and turns, I found this movie absolutely enthralling, thanks to the brilliantly matched acting of Caine and Olivier. They had to have enjoyed making this film immensely, because the pure acting delight comes through in every frame of this film. Wonderfully directed, with a delightful score - just sit back and have fun.

B007KQI1NA|5.0|I have a several year old version of Streets and Trips that came with a GPS receiver.  Out in the open, it worked better than expected.  In my plastic bodied car, it works fine.  In my wife's steel bodied car, nothing.<br /><br />For a couple years, I've been thinking about purchasing a better receiver and the GlobalSat products have been standouts.  Getting the latest for half what the previous version cost makes me very happy.  That the receiver works so well is just amazing.  When it sees the sats, it works very quickly.  If the receiver is buried in a basement of a two-story house, it still does not work so well (but what does?).<br /><br />A couple extra thoughts:  With Windows 8, it seems that no driver is needed outside of what Windows 8 finds by itself!  The GPS Info tool can be useful to see what satellites are visible to the receiver as well as making sure that it is functioning properly - the US site for GlobalSat has a single zipped download for the BU-353-S4 that contains a properly working version of GPS Info.  As of this review, the TW site for GlobalSat downloads is better avoided.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|I've been playing about a week, and I think it is almost addicting.  Almost.  I have not felt the need to even consider in app purchases.  However, there is some grinding.  You can replay early levels for getting 60 credits a pop easily.  The downside is why should I have to.  The game is too difficult past about level 5 without upgrades. . .lots of upgrades.  You don't need IAP to obtain, but a pain to grind.  Controls for placing objects can be tricky and you can accidently build where you did not intend.  Finally, enemies come in pres determined waves and flight paths so it becomes excercise in memorizing where to best place defenses.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|well I think that it is hard to unlock a lot of the games and you need to save up too many points. and a lot of the games are boring. the title of the games makes you think its going to be interesting but there's nothing related to the title in the games. this was a waste of my time.
0345803507|5.0|I found the triology of 50 Shade of Grey / Darker / freed, well written with a very intriguing story line. Did the writer have personal knowledge of the subject within the story? was she  a dom or Sub?? as I felt as I read the books that this was very real.<br />The way the writer put all the books together with their story lines was also what held my attention.<br />The ending seemed to be very quick and I wonder will there be a fourth to the story as anastasia is still pregnent?  Does Christian get over his torment, especially as now a father?.<br />Well worth the money for the books and if the writer EL James writes any more please inform me<br /><br />Malbet<br />Amazon verified Purchase

If you are already a Whovian, or if you've never before traveled with The Doctor, you will not be disappointed.

I downloaded this book because it was #4 on the NY Times Best Seller List (of course only edged out by the 50-Shades of Grey series) WOW, what a great story teller Gillian Flynn is!!! It took a couple of chapters to really get into the story, once she has you hooked, its hard to put this book down. I read 2/3's of it on my iphone and didn't mind a bit.<br />Incredible character development. Lots of twists and turns and ending you'd NEVER see coming.<br />If your feeling like you can or need to squeeze in one last book this summer, THIS IS THE BOOK!!!!

0451228731|5.0|When I started reading this novel I said, \\"Wow, there's no way the author can keep this pace for 700 pages!\\"  I also said, \\"This book is going to have the greatest ending ever!\\"  I was wrong on both counts.  Yes this novel is a bare knuckle, no holds barred, thrill ride from beginning to end.  It NEVER slows down, the plot advances further and further, and with each chapter things get more and more out of controlled and hopelessly complex.  The book is filled with characters, so many that after a while, I just stopped trying to remember them all.  It may help to make a list of characters as you go, because they show up at random intervals and you find yourself saying, \\"Who was that guy again, OH YA, THAT GUY!\\"  Unfortunately, for a novel that does nearly everything right, it does one thing wrong.  It doesn't end.  The ending isn't good, nor it is bad; its non-existent.  This book just ends, leaving you feeling a little cheated actually, considering the thrill ride that brought you to this point.  Now, there will be many that say, \\"Oh, you are just the typical American and you want your plot spoonfed to you, and you are just mad that you aren't creative enough to come up with your own ending for this novel.\\"  No, that's not it, I think its pretty clear how this story will end, but the author just doesn't bother to take you there.  Perhaps the author was trying to save the reader from the tedium of global annihilation, so he brings you right to the brink, and says, \\"Ok, things are looking bad, I don't need to tell you how this will probably end, and you don't want to accept it, so we will just leave it here and you can go on with your life always hoping that maybe, just maybe, things turned out OK.\\"  In a way, I felt like that was the key point of this novel.  Things change, and change is destructive, but the thing that makes change so destructive, isn't the ones who come after, its the ones that came before who refuse to let go of the past because they have this belief (regardless of what the history books say) that things will NEVER change, we will always be here, just like this, and those that have power will always have power.  You may even be one of those people, and if so, I'm sorry, but history would like a retort.ef (regardless of what the history books say) that things will NEVER change, we will always be here, just like this, and those that have power will always have power.

0547569653|5.0|Eat & Run is an important read for any human being that has ever doubted their own abilities or gave themselves an excuse as to why it is okay to give up. There are numerous stories of Scott getting injured and then finishing the race. We aren't talking stubbed toes or a cut either, he snaps tendons and keeps running breaks bones and still wins these races. Scott Jurek is an incredible athlete as well as a humble caring individual with a heart open to others sharing many of the secrets to his success as a ultramarathon champion. After meeting him in person it is safe to say he is not exaggerating or embellishing these stories nor is he prideful of his status in running. Scott has the desire to share running with the world and hoped that his acomplishments would spark others to get out and run. Half way into the book I couldn't stop reading, this guy was running all day all night on little food with no rest I could forego food for a while and finish this book. I sat on a bench in the park for hours until the sun went down finishing the last few pages by moon light. Here is a sneak peak into why I think this is a must read for everyone.<br /><br />\\"Life is not a race. Neither is an ultramarathon, not really, even though it looks like one. There is no finish line. We strive toward a goal, and whether we achieve it or not is important, but it's not what's most important. What matters is how we move toward that goal. What's crucial is the step we're taking now, the step you're taking now.\\"<br />[...]

0425241505|4.0|I liked this first novel in the series. It was fun and fast! I love a page turner! Read it in a day and a half! It's getting old that the female lead role in all the series I have been reading are down on themselves or clumsy or man dependant! This one is different! She doesnt brag on herself by any means but she doesnt second guess herself either! She is fun and cute and the man is hot! What more could you ask for??
B0081L37Z0|4.0|This is a fun film that does a good job with the original TV series. These two are funny together in their roles as undercover highschool brothers. Surprise at the end!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm on the edge of a cliff right now, so will be immediately continuing onto book 3 after this.<br />Poor Katniss!<br />For someone that didn't sign up for the position she's been stuck in, she sure holds her own. So strong, smart and resourceful, it seems she can get through anything. My heart still hurts for her though, knowing this shouldn't be happening to her. But then again, I am cheering her on all the while hoping she kicks some major butt!<br />Ok, so like the rest of the world, I saw the movie when it came out. And now I am dying to see this one. Sucks it doesn't come till next year though, and I'm not looking forward to a certain part with Cinna. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Lenny Kravitz!<br />Anyway, if you are the last person on earth to hear about this series, or just haven't the cash flow to get it, I highly suggest requesting it for a birthday gift or something. It's totally worth it!

0345803485|1.0|This book is quite confusing.  For starters, I did my best to find 50 shades of grey.  The cover is tinted blue, it's not even grey!  I suppose if the tint wasn't there, one could count 3 or 4 shades, tops.  The pages are more of an off-white with black text.  Nothing unusual for a book at all, but hardly what I'd call shades of grey.  So the title makes no sense at all.<br /><br />I also don't understand the cover, it shows a tie.  A fairly nice one, I may see if I can find a similar one when I next go shopping.  But the text has very little to do with ties, and more to do with being tied up!  Now if the cover art was a pun, and it was about two Thai people I'd forgive them, but it isn't.  It's apparently about a British woman whom thinks she's native to somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, and the man she meets that well, does have the surname of Grey.  But he's never described as being that color, so they can't even claim one of the characters as being a shade of Grey!<br /><br />I guess since it is set in the Pacific Northwest, and the stereotype of that area is being often cloudy and raining, one might count 50 shades of grey in the clouds.  But no illustration in the book shows such, so I think that hardly counts!<br /><br />In all, this book is just very confusing!  Maybe if they named this book 3 or 4 Shades of Blue that would be Grey if not Tinted it would be a much more accurate title!  For shame for such deception!

B005LAIIQC|4.0|\\"Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.\\" After trying to cover up and take care of the Jason Bourne problem the agents of TREADSTONE have another problem to deal with. When too much classified Intel gets out and the two heads of the project are seen together too often the decision is made to scrap the project and rebuild later. One by one the agents are canceled until the agents think they are safe. One has survived and Aaron Cross (Renner) isn't ready to end his mission yet. I have liked all of the movies in this series but have never really been obsessed with them. I was looking forward to this one because of Jeremy Renner and I was interested in what they will do with the series without Damon. I have to say that I was impressed and really did enjoy this movie. The only downside to it is that it really is nothing all that different from the other movies in the series. For fans of the series who are afraid to see this because of Damon not being in it don't worry, this is a worthy addition to the series. Overall, very good continuation to the franchise, but I thought the \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" was still better. Very much worth seeing though. I give it a B+.

0812982622|5.0|One of the best books of the year. . . A fantastically imaginative, exceptionally well written story about one of the most bizarre and inhospitable places to live on earth.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I used to be at the gym 5-7 days a week and would not for the life of me get below 150, no matter what I did. I had no idea this book existed until I was browsing through the web looking for the 4 Hour Work Week and I saw that Tim Ferriss had actually written another book! I was FLOORED before I even got the book because I knew it would be an awesome and worthwhile read. Guess what? I was right. I finally broke the 150 mark and I'm down to 148, while going to the gym sometimes 1 day and at the most 3 days :-) I eat more and better than I ever have and am so so so so happy because I'm fitting into clothes I could not fit into for almost 2 years since my little girl was born. I'm also very happy that I am not loosing my curves! This book shows you how to sculpt your body to keep your hour glass shape. IT IS A MUST BUY! It is a thick book, as thick as the Bible but it is basically like the Bible for fitness! Seriously! Worth every penny! Got it both on my phone and hard cover.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Southport is my home so while the movie production crew was here all summer filming the movie version of Safe Haven I decided I needed to read the book to see what all the hubbub was about.  This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read, and I must say I like his writing style.  Some of the things that I looked for in his book was how true he stayed to Southport.  For the most part he stayed very true to my town.  ( I thought the bike ride from Southport to Wilmington was a little over the top, and I can't think of a single bistro on Caswell beach) As I read this book and started to understand the characters I kept visualizing Julia Roberts in Sleeping with the Enemy.  However, while Safe Haven does have a lot of parallels with Sleeping with the Enemy it is not just a remake of that novel or movie.  The ending was awesome, I never saw that coming so hats off to Mr. Sparks for keeping me entertained.  I'm sure I will go see this movie when it hit's theaters.  Read this book you will enjoy it.

0743424425|5.0|I read this in a day, do yourself a courtesy and attempt the same. It helps if you find a temporary position at H&R block during tax season. I chose the Secretary position in an office hidden in a Sears department store. If you can find an office hidden as this one was, you will find yourself bored with Microsoft paint in no time. By the time you figure this out, a book might catch your eye. The Shining will captivate your attention for the entire day. You will feel sorry for the tax preparation going on in the background as you pour over the pages in front of you. Keep in mind that it isn't fair, but it is alright.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I read books one to three of the series and found them rather entertaining.  Book four left me with lots of unresolved cliff-hangers and then this one came along.  Huge disappointment.  Turgid and rambling, going off down all sorts of irrelevant side allies while barely even mentioning the plot points left hanging at the end of book four.  Not only that, but the violence - and yes, there's plenty in all the books because that's what the story is about, took some rather nasty and vicarious turns, all a bit unpleasant.<br /><br />I think the whole series would have been better if it were to have been condensed and wrapped up on three or four volumes.  I have to say that at the present rate of publication and with maybe four or five years to wait for volume six and then who knows how long until seven I may not bother continuing.  Such a shame.
0307593495|2.0|I won't rehash the plot, others have done a fine job of that. My problem with the book is that Henning Mankell was astonishingly lazy with his plotting. He seems to have made up the plot as he went along, with no clear idea of where he was going or what the solution would be. There's a stunningly inane, unbelievable, and contrived coincidence a third of the way through the book that ultimately ends up being totally unnecessary. I can't understand why Mankell didn't cut it, because it asks for such a massive suspension of disbelief that it ruins the novel. There are other plotting problems, ones you'd expect from a novice rather than an accomplished pro like Mankell. Whenever Wallander has a gap in his knowledge, rather than come up with a clever and interesting way for the detective to find out what he needs to know, Mankell creates instant expository characters to conveniently give Wallander answers and then leave the stage, never to be seen again in the novel (ie, Wallander knows nothing about East Germany, so he creates an East German defector Wallander once knew that can give him a detailed lecture on the specific area of Wallanders interest. Or, in another example, Wallander knows nothing about Swedish naval history, so Mankell creates a childhood friend Wallander has lost touch with who just happens to be an expert on everything that has ever happened to any naval officer or their family members in the history of Sweden, including the details of their day-to-day calendars). As a mystery, this book is a big, and often frustrating, disappointment that comes to a very unsatisfying, clumsy conclusion. But the novel does work as a melancholy look into the life of Kurt Wallander, a lonely and sad policeman who feels his age and is losing his grasp on his memory.
B004GF244K|5.0|The title says it all; even though it was 10 years ago, the tribute concert is still a pleasure to watch. Great music for a great musician.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book a week ago. I re-read it the same day. I have read about seven books since I read this one, but for some reason I still can't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />Slammed isn't perfect. The prose isn't all beautiful and flowy and amazing. The trope of teacher/student is probably a little cliche at this point and overdone. The name of the main character is awkward and I didn't like it at all.<br /><br />But the characters... they will grab hold of your heart and just won't let go. I fell in love with Will and Lake after their date. I fell in love with Lake's mom Julia when she acted like a real mother (something so rare in YA novels these days). I absolutely fell in love with Kel and Caulder, the younger brothers of Lake and Will who steal the show throughout the book.<br /><br />And the poetry... I hate poetry. In most novels if there is poetry I just skip it over and ignore it. It seems a common thing these days to make heroines of YA novels all about poetry and classic novels. I was sure I would hate a book where the characters are so emotional about poetry. Instead, I found myself sucked in by it. For the first time I actually read the words and liked them.<br /><br />The last chapter of this book, including the last two poems, just moved me. That's such a cheesy way to say it, but I'm not very eloquent and I can't think of a better way. Over the past week I've re-read the last chapter of this book every time I've felt a little down because there's no way to read that last chapter and not sit there with a huge grin on your face.<br /><br />Just writing about this book as me wanting to go read it again. Which I think I will do as soon as I hit save on this review. READ IT!

1118026470|2.0|The first 3 chapters are a very good review of the state of Internet security in general.  Then you hit chapter 4 and everything becomes C.I.P.U. (clear if previously understood) in a hurry. What is \\"Burp\\" and why do I need it?  You have to jump to chapter 20 to find out, where you are told how to set up a proxy server. So now what?  Use Burp to figure things out! We're going in a circle here. (And this assumes you've got your proxy even working.)<br /><br />The book also stresses on-line learning thru their website, for a modest fee. But just what do you get for these lessons.  I don't know, because the first one doesn't occur until chapter 5. And by then I was turned off by the book.<br /><br />To be fair, there's a gold mine of material in this book. But it's not for the beginner.  You have to put it together like a jig saw puzzle, but without benefit of any picture of what the finished puzzle should look like.<br /><br />If you are already beyond basic hacking, are aware of the tools available, and know the HTML standard inside out, then this is probably a good book for you. But it is way too much for the newbie. This book should come with the skill level notice of \\"For intermediate to advanced users.\\"
B005VPRF0M|5.0|\\"The Batwing Battle Over Gotham City\\" set contains 278 pieces which come together to form my favorite \\"DC Universe\\" set. The Batwing and the Jokers Chopper. Set comes with 3 figures; a Joker w/machine gun, a Joker henchman and a Batman w/ 2 batarangs. Both were bigger than I expected, the wingspan on the Batwing is 8 inches. The batwing has a flick missile under each wing, a bat bomb that detaches via a push button, up and down cockpit and the back wings raise up to form a 'X'. The Jokers Chopper has 2 flick missiles on each side and a cute Joker face flick missile underneath, has a dangling ladder, up and down cockpit as well and the blades spin nice and smooth.<br /><br />Both are super durable, solidly built and look pretty sweet, especially the Batwing. Nothing falls off during play which is a plus. Just another great set by Lego.

B00280LYIC|5.0|a few years ago i watched the movie that was released and i enjoyed the movie. i found out that there was a book for it so i picked it up for my kindle. i wont get to much into the details of the story as you can find those in other reviews but this book is definitely different from what most people would think the Olympian gods are like. The plot was very interesting as i personally enjoy Greek mythology and history. i would recomend this book to any child who knows at least a little information about greek mythology and to adults who have interests in greek mythology.
125000568X|5.0|Whether you're a lifelong Queen fan or a person who has just discovered their music, this book is a must have.

B007UW9VWO|5.0|Jiro Ono is an 85 year old sushi chef who owns Sukiyabashi Jiro, a restaurant in the basement of a Tokyo high-rise building which only seats ten people. It has a three star Michelin rating, and many in the area consider it the best sushi restaurant in the world. People travel from round the world and make reservations months in advance in order to sample the treasures that lie within.<br /><br />This fascinating documentary follows Jiro and his two sons, as well as many of his apprentices, as they prepare meals, share stories about their experiences with Jiro, and make plans for the future. The film also delves into the complicated past of this extraordinary man. His parents left him to fend for himself at the tender age of nine, and he has worked extremely hard all of his life. At almost 90 years of age, Jiro is still very active, never ceasing in his craft, always striving for perfection. The many interviewees in the film regard him as something of a legend, and in fact, he is.<br /><br />The film is perfectly crafted, captivating, and mouthwatering. With a musical soundtrack containing the likes of Philip Glass and other such minimalist composers, the filmmakers capture Jiro's simple style of artistry and create the perfect mood for the proceedings.<br /><br />Magnolia Pictures has released 'Jiro' on Blu-ray with a commentary, and several other special features worth viewing.<br /><br />Rated PG, 88 minutes, directed by David Gelb, released by Magnolia Pictures.
0345803485|5.0|So I wanted to know that every one was talking and how this book was so good, and when I started reading it I knew right away what the fuss was about. This is truly my most favorite book trilogy of all time. I could not put it down I read all 3 in two week their addicting. Im about to re-read them because I have not found any thing better and I can't stop thing about the characters. These atelier the best books ever!

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This book is far and away the finest novel that I've read by a living writer in very many years, Speed readers, keep away! The prose is eloquent, deeply felt, graceful, and deserves to be read slowly and savored. The protagonist, meditating on his traumatic boyhood, is richly realized. Ford has written several very good novels, and Canada is his finest.
030758836X|5.0|This is one delicious twister of a book. It's really not what I expected from the reviews. I had stayed away from spoilers because I knew it had \\"What the heck just happened?\\" twists. The twists are head-spinning. This is the second Gillian Flynn book I have read and man does she have a talent for extremely odd but beautifully apt descriptions and imagery. I can't recall an example here but I don't know how many times my jaw dropped at some incredible phrasing.<br /><br />Characters. It says a lot that you will feel sympathy for the emotional distant, apathetic husband who is cheating on his wife.The wife is an unforgettable psychopath: so much so that I question if such psychopathic planning is even possible. It's a little over the top. I really would like to know if she is any way based on a living person.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who have criticized the ending. I guess having read a Flynn book, it did not at all surprise me that there is no happy ending. She doesn't seem to do those. The ending is open and it is difficult to imagine that any good could come of these two people.<br /><br />Flynn, a former writer for Entertainment Weekly, gleefully skewers the entertainment industry press while adding pop culture nuggets here and there like name dropping authors whose works you have probably read but whose names you can't recall. Many books incorporate some famous work of literature in the stories, but this one happily doesn't base a plot point on a famous work but instead references several works in a passing mention. I liked that.

0812982622|3.0|Definitely worth reading, and it is very obvious that alot of research has been done for this fiction as there are so many wonderfully surprising facts woven into the characters of diverse classes and status of this enigmatic country. The story, as expected, is very depressing but at the same time, has dark humor and is entertaining.  The only reason for 3 stars is that this is a kind of book that has alot of events, and slightly lacks depth of characters.

B007Q476KU|5.0|Once again, I am taking a different angle on a movie that, on the surface, appears to be about the heroic triumph of an \\"exceptional\\" horse. To me, it is about the heroic triumph of the human spirit, as manifested by the individuals whom the horse, Joey, encounters during his lifetime. At each crossroad the horse encounters, with peril and death on one side and salvation on the other, an individual arises to assist the horse and facilitate his survival, often at great risk to themselves.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Albert and his father save Joey from an ignominious life. The English officer selects Joey as his personal mount, promising to protect him. The German brothers shelter and protect Joey while in German hands. The Grandfather and his granddaughter rescue Joey from the Germans temporarily. Once back in German hands, the horse is again sheltered and protected by the enlisted man in charge of horses. In a pivotal scene, both a German and English soldier risk their lives to extricate Joey from barbed wire. The horse is spared from euthanasia by a caring English doctor, sensing the special bond between Joey and Albert....etc. etc. It should be noted that saviors arise from all walks of life and on both sides of the wartime conflict. In this respect it is much more even-handed than most productions, thus making its message more universal.<br /><br />Secondly, there are no real \\"villains\\". War is depicted as a futile horror, but the people involved in it do not inflict needless harm on the horse. Joey is forced to pull a huge cannon (with human assistance) to the top of a hill, but this is not done out of cruelty but rather perceived necessity by the soldiers who possess him. In addition, this bit of \\"cruelty\\" is no worse than that inflicted by Joey's initial saviors when he was forced to plow a hard and rock-strewn field...again, perceived necessity. Unlike most traditional \\"noble animal\\" stories, no one goes out of their way to inflict suffering on the horse, he,like the humans he coexists with, suffer together.<br /><br />In conclusion, the horse demonstrates great nobility during his adventures, but so do the humans he encounters. Indeed, without them to guide and assist him on his way, his story would have been much shorter....and much less noble. For this reason, I feel this story was elevated far above the standard \\"animal in peril\\" tearjerker. It presents scenarios in which good people risk their lives to do good deeds for a good animal, and thus portrays a triumph of the spirit of both humans and horse.

B005LAIGWS|3.0|The story has some good ingredients and some inconsistencies.  The script has some good lines as well as some dull contrived BS. The visuals of the flaming skull are much improved over the previous pic.... However, to insert stationary art and time slowed violence scenes just interrupts the movie. Only Cage and the guy who plays the devil shine as actors. (Where is Fonda, anyway?)The others are just acceptacle. And the over the top scenes with mining equipment and other flaming mechanical devices is a bit much. Within all this a decent movie resides.....but must we be conflicted with all that other dross to enjoy it? I am looking forward to a third edition, if there is one....
B004529NKC|5.0|A nice feel good movie!The dance scenes are incredible!!! it's nice to see a movie about one person trying to make a difference for him, his friends and neighborhood.It reinforces that old adage that persistance over comes resistance.You will enjoy the movie.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|This is a brilliant and absolutely groundbreaking book. But, I have no idea why it has such obvious flaws. The last chapter how Africa became black is almost a comedy. Is he aware of how silly what he is writing sounds to a learned African? It is pure Eurocentric arrogance. Here are \\"blacks\\" and then here are \\"khoisan\\" and according to his European eyes they are two different groups. The Somalia and the Wolof are in the same group--but not the San(because they are small and have big bums--as if Somali women don't). If in doubt consult an actually African and stop writing about people via your Eurocentric lens.  I don't think he has been to Africa the way he wildly generalize similarity and difference is such backward ways using such backward terms like \\"black\\" to describe diverse people. This one thing does spoil the book, because I expected more from a progressive. It would make you think all Africans are black in color.<br /><br />Which one is it south west Asia or Fertile Crescent? Pick one and stick with it. The novice reader would be rushing for a map. Only to find the author is making up new Geographic paradigms. Worst Eurasia how can I connect with a territory created to make his case. How on Earth is North Africa, not Africa but Eurasia? Then in comes Ethiopia to mess up his plan. So should we say Ethiopia is atypical and hence not Africa? Everything in Ethiopia makes it line up with North Africa, but this caveat messes up the Sub-Saharan African argument. Now in comes black people and European people. Where do these black people come from,? Because I know where Europeans come from. Then say Africans and Europeans! The book is random, messy in its flexible terminology and this is its greatest weakness. Because terms such as sub-Saharan Africa are more colonial than historical and if you are working out of these models you distort history - as he has done.<br /><br />Please do not let the above review make anyone think I did not consider this book an absolutemasterpiece. It is because it is such a masterpiece that these flaws are so annoying. This is the kind of book power brokers and statesmen will read. No one book can sum up the history of everything, but this comes as close as humanly possible. I am more sensitive to the flaws in geographical designations and linguistics because it is a subject I follow in detail.<br /><br />The book is a gift to a new understanding and all kinds of subsequent work will be based upon some of its paradigm shifts.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I thought this was a very sweet book about a boy with a deformity and how he coped with it.  It is a \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" book and I think school children should all have to read it and then teachers could have discussions with the kids.  The boy in the book captures your heart and you want everyone to see the \\"inner\\" person and accept him.  I picked it to read to see if it would be a good book for my 12 year old and I would highly recommend it for kids of all ages.  The author made it very relatable to keep kids interest and funny.  It was not too sad, but just enough to feel how the boy feels.  He is a strong person and you just want him to succeed in life and be happy.
0151012768|5.0|I'll actually begin with the book's shortcomings: the characters are rather one-dimensional. The author did attempt a bit of character development for the main protagonist (the fisheries scientist) but it was so plainly obvious in which direction he was to develop.<br /><br />So why rate the book a whopping five stars? For two reasons - first, it's extremely readable and has some extremely funny moments (the cameo appearance of Boris Johnson was just one such example). And most importantly, the ending was just perfect. I've seen so many would-be-great books irredeemably botched by a stupid ending, that this one was like a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />P.S.<br />There is a movie now, I haven't seen it but from what I gather it seems like a bit of a dumb-down from the book; so do not use the movie as a basis of judgement.

It´s such a shame, guys...look at BAD RELIGION...their albuns may sound the same, but they never try to become a TEENAGE band!!! well, for me is over!!! i will always respect what OFFSPRING did in the past, but now they really become a joke...
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is actually my first English book that i have read. Even the language is little bit harder to understand in some passages it is actually no bog problem to understand context. Book itself is a masterpiece of thriller, horror and drama. The classy format of diaries, correspondence making feel that you are reading the file of some case is astonishing clever. This book is way to discover history of England/Europe, get thrilled by original story of Dracula and to understand what it mean the word Gentleman.

B005FISBTO|4.0|Dexter is one of the few shows I actually buy on DVD (or Blu-Ray this year).  The idea of the character is unique among the genre, and the first seasons carried it off so well, better in many ways than the books, which is also a unique quality.  There is always some significant suspension of disbelief (how many times do people get to sneak into Dexter's house before he gets an alarm?  Even the cliff hanger:  Dexter would never have been so careless to allow it to happen, except when it's convenient to the story.  Dexter only works two hours a day, stays up all night, and is fine.)<br /><br />Season six is different.  There is a continual darkness to it that wasn't there before, which I think happens because we don't have the lighter side:  no Rita, no Cody, no Astor.  Only we have a weaker villain, so the general darkness is mismatched to the weak bad guy, and some too easy resolutions to conflict.  Edward James Olmos could have been put to better use, and there are many opportunities to make the storyline tense that just zipped by.  We also had the focus on Debra's problems, and less on the other characters than we have seen in the past, including adding a new detective with very little character development.  In fact, we find the characters uniformly not liking the new guy in one episode, and then the theme disappears.<br /><br />On the other hand, the cliff hanger means that next season has to be really different.  Unless it was a dream.  Deb as LT with LaGuerta as the boss with no one to intervene.  Either the show jumped the shark this year and we won't find out until next, or it is really going to get interesting.

1594630844|5.0|Professor Karl Pillemer went on a quest of sorts to gather information from the elderly, discover their wisdom and turn this wisdom into practical advice for the rest of us.  Pillemer's main thesis is that these folks have by virtue of their age experience from which we all can learn.  He breaks up the topics into categories like marriage, work, etc.  There is a lot of useful advice here.  For example: stop worrying.  The elderly said that this is a useless emotion that made very little in their lives.  Another good nugget is to take care of your body, not to keep yourself from dying, but to live a life without chronic disease.  Pillemer indicated that many people who do not follow this advice simply expect to drop dead at some point.  What happens instead is that they end up with maybe 20 years or so of chronically poor health.  There is also interesting advice on child-rearing as well as how to maintain a good mindset towards death - it turns out most of the elderly don't fear it the way younger people do.  A lot of benefit can be gained from reading this book.  As the author suggested, why not take advantage today of the lessons learned by those who came before us.

B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The HP calculator in itself is phenomenal. When a calculator can withstand the test of time, in the information age no less, you know it's special. However,...<br /><br />Of the four protective pads at the rear corners of the calculator, one of the pads came off when I first put the calculator inside the case. I have since tried sticking it back on, but every time I put the calculator into the case and pull it back out, the pad is removed. I did not expect such poor product quality from HP. 5 stars for the calculator and its phenomenal functions -1 star for the build quality (although I was tempted to remove 2 starts).
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|30 Minutes or Less is a really good comedy/suspense.  It's about Jesse Eisenberg playing the part of a pizza delivery boy who happens to deliver a pizza to the wrong house one night involving two nerdy out of shape young men who come up with this scheme to kidnap Jesse's character and deliberately make him go through with a bank robbery.  These men also contact a hitman in case the robbery doesn't succeed for whatever reason, and the hitman plays a huge role in the movie near the end.<br /><br />This is definitely more a comedy than a suspense, that's for sure!  I was laughing pretty much the entire time.  Jesse brings along his friend Aziz Ansari who's equally funny and finds himself in all kinds of comedy segments as well.  Basically the storyline is hilarious because it revolves around several familiar bank robbery/money delivering antics that go *completely* wrong.  A twist on the genre if you will.  A good example is when Jesse and Aziz walk into a bank, tells everyone to get on the floor and when it's discovered one woman has a gun, she tosses it across the room and an innocent man gets shot when the gun hits the counter, which prompts him to yells at HER and therefore takes the attention away from the robbers, lol.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention Jesse has a bomb strapped to his chest the entire time?  Yeah that's an important element to the storyline!  Sometimes the bomb is used as a way to gain an advantage which you'll find out about later.  Good writing there.  There's several swear words being tossed around, especially by the father of the two guys who come up with the bank robbery plan.  The father had me rolling on the floor with laughter because of his strict military-like demeanor and the ways he'd constantly belittle his own son and his friend, lol.<br /><br />Overall hilarious, well-told and just a lot of fun.  That pretty much describes 30 Minutes or Less... and this review only took me less than 10 minutes to write.

B000068FWC|5.0|There seems to be a major resurgence of interest in 1970s music as today's 15-25 year olds rediscover music from that decade.

B006TTC5JK|4.0|Sweet, lovely comedy, adapted from Mary Chase's play by the author and Oscar Brodney, gave Jimmy Stewart one of his signature roles as kindly Elwood P. Dowd - the good-natured bachelor whose best friend is a six-foot tall-plus rabbit who appears only to him. Hollywood has tried numerous times over the years to remake \\"Harvey\\" (most recently with Steven Spielberg expressing interest), but there's an innocence and playfulness in Henry Koster's 1950 film that's going to be impossible for anyone to recapture. Universal's 1080p AVC encoded transfer is another winner, offering good detail (and a happy lack of DNR) in its crisp B&W image. Extras include an introduction from Jimmy Stewart that was filmed for the early `90s video release, plus two more Universal 100 Years featurettes (the Carl Laemmle Era, the Lew Wasserman Era), plus a DVD, digital copy and the theatrical trailer.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Love these guys, have seen them play in the USA and Germany; have listened to them all over the world.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks stepped away from their usual rolls and did a wonderful job in a heavier serious role. The screen play is well written, and touches the still unspeakable ongoing loss of the worst day in America. I was moved.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was fast paced and well written.  The characters have depth and draw you in.  Nice twist at the end.

B006LSZECO|1.0|All I can say is the book was good and kept my attention, but once it reached the last 30 pages or so the author seriously let me down, it was horrible, even terrible.  I wanted to throw my kindle across the room.....All that time I will never get back.  I won't be reading anything from this author again.
B007XNAOS0|5.0|3rd release from expansive, forward-thinking \\"metal\\" band out of Savannah, Georgia.  Though<br />  dedicated metal-heads may disagree; \\"Yellow & Green\\" is, to my ears, their masterpiece so far.<br />  It's a surprisingly diverse album with an epic sincerity that owes as much to the grandeur of U2<br />  and the pop pathos of the National as it does to the prog-metal of Opeth or the psychedelic<br />  doom of Orange Goblin.  This is a magnificently warm and richly textured psych-prog, post-Goth,<br />  atmospheric pop-metal album.  The songs are subtle and intricate, but ring with the thick and<br />  muscular power of trenchant metal songcraft, meticulously arranged and delivered with the<br />  Devil's own polish.  Vocal harmonies and dual guitars help give it a full, sonorous sense of<br />  strength and direction.  Includes members from Birds Of Prey & A Place To Bury Strangers.<br />  \\"Yellow & Green\\" incorporates a wide myriad of influences & styles, and references a diverse<br />  range of bands:  Pink Floyd, Big Elf, Led Zeppelin, Fields of the Nephilim, Wishbone Ash, Sleepy<br />  Sun, Thin Lizzy, Muse, Sea of Green, Torche, Hypnos 69, Mastodon, the Cult, Mangoo, the<br />  Kings of Frog Island, Ozric Tentacles, Astra, Solstafir, Crippled Black Phoenix, and many more.<br />  This is a rock album of grand proportions, with enough variety & distinct quality of creation to<br />  give it a sense of classic timelessness.  Truly impressive, one of the best of 2012.
1468161660|5.0|Loved this book and the follow up Point of Retreat.  Couldn't put them down, you really care about the characters.  I usually don't re-read a book, but I found myself wanting to follow their story again and again!!!

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Having read a small sample of Fifty Shades - (and given up in disgust at the really, seriously poor quality of writing)- and a lot of the very witty reviews of which the vast majority are in agreement that the book is 'total crap', the only question that is going through my mind is 'WHY then, are all three books BESTSELLERS??' It doesn't make sense! There have always been badly written books  out there, they are read by a few people and they sink without trace, some quite well written books fall into this abyss too...<br />- Is it just the sex?? I am baffled!
0307716546|5.0|This is a very interesting mystery.<br />A mother and her teenage daughter become comatose after a fire. However, their minds leave their bodies and try to find out who caused this horrible crime.<br />My husband would think this book absolutely ridiculous because he likes straight forward mysteries, but I found AFTERWARDS quite believable and readable. Lupton's writing is masterful and beautiful, and grabs your heart.<br /><br />If you are Mother, you'll understand Grace immediately. Her love for her daughter Jenny and her needs to protect everybody in her family broke my heart. I knew there wouldn't be a perfect ending for all of them, but I still kept hoping until the end.<br /><br />As a mystery, there are so many turns and twists that you'll never get bored.<br /><br />And you'll cry even if you think the story was a bit weird.<br /><br />I loved SISTER by the same author and I will definitely read her next book.
0470570954|5.0|Wow. This book is an excellent biochemical resource. It is a little dense, but if you have a sturdy background in physics, math, and chemistry, you'll find the material efficient and right to the point.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Keeps your interest.  I read the book fairly quickly and couldn't put it down.  Another good book by Danielle Steele
0425263908|2.0|I gave this book two stars because the author is an excellent writer, HOWEVER, I was really disappointed with this book. After reading the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy, \\"Bared to You\\" has a lot of similarities to FSoG. Those similarities are what turned me off. I felt that the writer basically twisted small facts of FSoG and restructured them into BTY, some of which I think mocks FSoG. Some of the examples are... the foil packet, cell phone tracking/stalking, Eva cannot stand to be touched by anyone else but Gideon, Eva works out and eats all the time, Eva will not agree to sub/dom relationships, Gideon's brother will go to great lengths to steal everything Gideon has, Gideon wipes off Eva's make-up and provides close and a separate bedroom in his house, they are both chauffeured around, Gideon automatically appears to save Eva from some close calls, Gideon owns everything (Gym, nightclub, office building), they make a point to watch TV shows together, Gideon prefers Brunette's over Blonde's and Eva is Blonde, money is no issue because Eva has her own money, the rings they give each other are not for a proposal yet. There is so much more I could add, but I will stop for now.<br /><br />Even though the characters in BTY are more developed and their abusive childhood is different with a slightly different family story, this was not enough for me to look beyond the similarities to FSoG. These details are what made FSoG stand out from all the rest.<br /><br />There is a possibility I could have enjoyed this book IF I had not read FSoG first. \\"Bared to You\\" was a good effort at creating a sequel trilogy to these new erotic romance novels, but \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is the original and I will not forget that.<br /><br />Good luck to you all!
B005EY2XFC|5.0|It is such a shame that this was Brandon Lee's last film. He played his role perfectly! And the best time to watch this movie is at midnight with all the lights out. The movie is not only dark with it's lighting (which is how it should be) but the theme is also dark. Very enjoyable, and eerie, and bring your teddy bear!
B0006J28BO|4.0|Very original story with exciting characters.  This is another fun one to watch with my daughter.  Haru's experiences in the Cat Kingdom are very hilarious.  And then with Baron Von Cat and Muta...and a crazy King, well...you get the picture.  Get it?  Get the picture?  :) I strongly recommend this one!
B00004Y2QT|5.0|I was extremely happy with this great concert..soo entertaining..and colorful! Prince so handsome in his on stage attire and wonderful camera shots.. the music was fantastic!!
B00338QENI|4.0|This is an extremely well done and interesting read on many levels.  There were times when reading the book that I thought that I would not have had the tenacity to follow through with the story as well as the author has done.  This book gives many insightful moments into the life of black families on the brink of poverty and homelessness.  There are also insights into the wide gulf between white and black america, as well as the willingness of individuals as well as large institutions to take advantage of people in poverty.  Surprisingly enough, I also noted the desperate creativity that can happen when people are on the verge of having nothing.  In the \\"money is everything\\" world that we inhabit here in the USA it is more than interesting to know that one of our larger wealthier institutions, Johns Hopkins University, would never consider reparations to the Lacks family no matter how much money they may have made from her cells.  Well you've got to have money and some status to sue.  If they had summoned the wherewithall to press for money who knows where the Lacks descendants might end up........graduating from school, college and contributing to our society perhaps?<br /><br />In conclusion, this is not an easy book to read, but I believe that it is well worth the effort.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|i enjoyed  all three books very much, and recommended them to all my friends. i was however very disappointed,because i had purchased all three books at once,when it came to the last book freed ,i was only a few pages into it when it said i couldnt continue. i tried doing what it told me but it wouldnt work.so i just purchased the last book freed again.i just had to know how it all ended.

B0063IH60K|1.0|I originally gave this game a good review but I was playing tonightand a stupid commerical like one gets on television csme on and just about blasted me out of my seat and one has to tap the menu button and then tap the back button while yhis ad blares at you. Now normally I don 't mind the ads as most are silent but when a loud annoying stjpid tv type thing comes on I get upset,  I know you have the ads to make some money but this just seems greedy in the extreme. When watching tv I almost always mute the commericals after they have run a few times as my attention span is more than six minutes and if the next time I play this game I am assailed by loud boring ads for products I care little or nothing about I will uninstall this game. Also just in case mobilityware puts them in the other games I have I will uninstall them before I am bombarded by this crap e and needless to say I will not get another game from this developer. Remember silence is golden,  especially in the middle of the night!!!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this book very helpful in formatting my novel No Plans for Love for Kindle. I am about to embark on formatting my next novel, Lost Memories, on Kindle. I look forward to working with a book that has such clear instructions and images to describe the process. If any writer wants to publish an ebook for Kindle, I recommend this book. The instructions are easily comprehended and to the point.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Great book to have on the shelf as it covers everything you need to know for getting in better shape and stronger.  I bought on Kindle and was very easy to read and had good information. Everything is presented in a simple format so people can understand and don't feel overwhelmed.  Presentation gives everyone hope they can improve their health.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery app is simply awesome. I'm hooked. It lets me know everything i want to know about my battery without going all over the place. I especially like the temperature, voltage, usage, and battery percentage graph over time features. I leave the widget on my homescreen with temp displayed so i can see if my battery is overheating. It would've come in handy when i fried my first battery bc it got too hot and actually warped and bulged out. 5 stars!
B00009YOQW|5.0|I found this drum after hunting for a solid musical toy for my son that could stand up to some heavy use and be a quality product. Plan Toys delivered! I've had as much fun playing it as my son. The different tones are excellent, and it is about as sturdy as it can be. If I had to find a con, I wish the middle tone area had a support under it like the other two do. I understand why it doesn't musically but that creates the only potential point of failure. Even with that said, it would take some heavy use/abuse to break anything. Great sound, well-built, looks good, and safe... a perfect toy!
0375869026|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I was left speechless by \\"Wonder\\", R.J. Palacio's homage to anybody who's ever been judged on his / her physical appearance. If you were moved by Sharon M. Draper's \\"Out of My Mind\\", you will be, in turn, agitated, affected, angered - and, ultimately, inspired by \\"Wonder.\\"<br /><br />What Palacio achieved with \\"Wonder\\" that puts it over \\"Out of My Mind\\" is in the inclusion of the points of view of the other players in August's story. While August's severe physical disfigurement is the main focus of the story, Palacio (in the course of a mere 320 pages) acknowledges through her characters that, sometimes, our physical hang-ups are more to do with our own perceptions than those of others (and so it's something we can overcome ourselves). Of course, the fact that one of the auxiliary characters is a 15-year-old who has read \\"War and Peace\\" just made my day (see previous review).<br /><br />I tried to find some fault with the story - but, honestly, I came up short. RJ Palacio's handling of her subject matter was sensitive and age-appropriate. While I wasn't quite sure why Justin's point of view was laid out in all lower case, it did not distract from the pace, mood, setting or point of the novel. A *wonderful* TIMELESS read for ALL AGES, EVERYWHERE. Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\" 'Wonder' by RJ Palacio is an awesome book about how a boy, considered a medical wonder because he has, unluckily, two genes that make his face look horrendous, tries to fit into a world of regular-looking people .<br /><br />\\"August Pullman is pretty much like any other boy: he likes Star Wars and ice cream, and his favorite holiday is Halloween (candy and creepy things ... every boy's dream!) The problem is that no one seems to realize that he is ordinary on the inside - probably because his face would make Frankenstein's monster look cute.<br /><br />\\"Homeschooled Auggie has had to deal with stares and taunts andscreams all his life - but it's usually okay, because either his big sister, Via, is there with him to take care of the bullies, or his dog, Darth Daisy (Daisy for short), is.<br /><br />\\"But when Auggie has to go to fifth grade IN A REGULAR SCHOOL ... let's just say that he isn't looking forward to it at all. Everyone staring at him and calling him names? No thank you!!<br /><br />\\"And those things DO happen - the kids in his school invent a game called 'The Plague' (where if anyone touches Auggie, they will catch his ugliness) and call him the Zombie Kid. They say in his face how 'I would totally want to kill myself if I looked like Auggie.'  Yet, despite all that, Auggie also finds himself some real friends. Can Auggie and his friends stand up to the bullies of the school? Or will they let themselves be walked all over?<br /><br />\\"I love, love, love, LOVE this book. It is so sweet and hopeful and wonderful - and I love how there were different perspectives throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"My favorite character would have to be Summer. She was one of the first people to be nice to August, without being told to by an adult, and she was really funny and nice. However, I also like Jack and Auggie. Jack was one of the first people to be nice to August as well, and, even though, he made some mistakes, he stood by Auggie in the end. And, of course, I love Auggie. He was so sweet and funny - even though it seemed like the world was a giant lottery and he pulled the unlucky ticket.<br /><br />\\"I like how the book is full of little quotes, too. Ever since I was in 4th grade, I've 'collected' awesome quotes from books, movies, celebrities, etc. So the fact that not only is the book itself awesome, but that it also contains some of my all-time favorite quotes, is amazing!<br /><br />\\"A few years ago, I read a book that is kind of like this - it was called \\"Out of My Mind\\", and was about a girl whose whole entire body was basically paralyzed by cerebral palsy, but her brainwas still working, and she got a computer that helped her talk to people, but people still didn't treat her very well. That book was good as well, but I have to say that 'Wonder' is better. 'Out of My Mind' was more 'why did this happen to ME?!' and 'Wonder' was more like 'how can I make this situation better?'<br /><br />\\"I would give the book seven stars if I could: two stars for the plot, three stars for the characters, and two stars for the awesome writing. :-) Best. Book. Ever.\\"
086571701X|4.0|Excellent book for the first timer. Gives you a grass roots approach. The book is easy reading and should get you started in you aquaponic adventure.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty shades is indeed the best romance I have ever read and according to one reviewer it has literally ruined all other books for me.  It has taken me a while to write this review because I think it warranted justification to this trilogy.<br /><br />Yes there was some repetition involved, the biting lip thing was a little overrated as well as the inner goddess thing, but looking past that it was pure brilliance.<br /><br />I dislike how people have said its porn for women, when actually it's a truly breathtaking and amazing story about a young man with a deeply troubled soul that stemmed from a  horrendous childhood,who developed a coping mechanism by having BDSM short term relationships in order to avoid any emotional feelings towards a girl. Then he encounters the beautiful Ana that intrigues the S*** out him because of her innocence and humility and who is also not an opportunist.  There is a physical attraction in the beginning that neither of them can avoid.<br /><br />Christian is the epitome of a fantasy come true. He is absolutely the most giving,caring, loving, understanding, sinfully good-looking and seriously rich character I have ever encountered in any book. Yes he is overprotective at times, but this stems from his undying love for Ana.  And off course Ana knows how to handle him and not accept all of his `controlling tendencies', and since she is the first to do this Christian loves her more because of it.<br /><br />I must admit I had no idea that this was an erotic series when I started the first book and was therefore taken by storm when the scenes started. This however made it much more realistic in appreciating Ana's views about the whole BDSM relationship  and `the red room of pain'which I never knew exisited.  I could relate to how she felt after the first spanking and I actually cried with her.<br /><br />I have truly enjoyed the emails  back and forth, that was so amusing and romantic. `Yes a little email sparring will do that to a girl' .And off course eventually the twitching palms was pleasurable. Let's not forget about those silver balls. Oh My! Guys, you could take a few hints in how to please a woman.  I also loved the idea of `more' and what it means in any relationship.<br /><br />It was a joy to read about the evolution of Christian from being control freak, dominant and crazy to becoming the absolutely most perfect person in this planet. Seriously I would recommend this novel for young mature people who should set standards in what is tolerable and what is unacceptable in any relationship. Girls, set your standards high as to how much S*** you can take from any man.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to all my friends. Thank you E.L James for an amazing story.

B004QL7K6Q|5.0|Im baffled by the poor reviews of this movie. Must be the Mid-Westerners chimming in. Yeah, if your a prude then rent something else. This is an adult comedy, for people with a modern sense of humor.<br /><br /> Jen and Paul Rudd are a married couple who lose their jobs and home. They then stumble upon a Hippie village by accident in the middle of nowhere GA. Things seem perfect at first, only to find out that the grass isnt always greener. This movie had my wife and I gasping for air after the first 2 minutes. Rent it, buy it, whatever! You wont be dissapointed! I agree that some jokes are drawn out; but they appear to do so, knowingly, on purpose, and it was funny regardless.<br /><br />Cliff notes: Swearing, crude humor, nudity, reefer, peyote, Jennifer Annistone, whats not to like?!
030758836X|5.0|I hadn't read anything by Gillian Flynn, and have to admit that though I'm an avid reader, I wasn't familiar with her or even that she was from Kansas City.  I only picked up this book because of the fact that it takes place in Missouri, and I'm a fan of mysterys and suspense. I purchased this book on a Friday evening, and once I hit about page 40, I was hooked.  The distinct back and forth (chapter wise) of the telling of the story, the absolute disgust I developed toward both main characters, the surprises the writer provides with each chapter, added up to an amazing read.  I've never in my life read a book quite like this one.  I am definitely going to get her other 2 books.  As the title of my review states, I was up till 2:00AM finishing this book...24 hours after I purchased it.  Thank you, Ms. Flynn, for a book that I'm still talking about a week later.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Love this album and so happy I bought it.  I went and got their CD and after i listened to it for the first time I was in love with them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app because the cards move with so mug fluidity! I also love that there is an option to play on multiplayer mode. Also, to the people who get turned off by the ads, there is the option to click away from the ad either immediately or within 5 seconds. Plus, it's free.
B00006EXL5|4.0|I went and got their CD and after i listened to it for the first time I was in love with them. I ended up buying the next two albums as well.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Each update either totally fails, or if it actually works, it requires a complete uninstall and reinstall (it does this each time by itself). Therefore I lose all saved gameplay. Sucks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was really good and delivered quickly to my Kindle.  I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked and ended up buying the rest of the series two days later to see how it ended.
0553212478|4.0|Like Dracula, this book did not tell the story I thought I already knew.<br /><br />Frankenstein is another one of those stories to have entered the Western consciousness so deeply that we're all convinced we know it. We see it in cartoons, in comedies, in serious movies, stories, and TV shows. We see the green-skinned monster with his arms out, shuffling along and moaning, the little girl with a flower, and the brave (if wrongheaded) townspeople bristling with torches and pitchforks. What we don't see is Shelly's monster, and whether I mean Frankenstein's creation, Frankenstein himself, or all of humanity is something you have to decide by reading the book.<br /><br />I was sympathetic to the narrator from time to time. Other times I caught myself saying internally \\"if you would have just reacted with kindness from the beginning...\\" In other words, I really debated who the monster was - he whose creation violated the laws of nature, or he who hated his creation.<br /><br />From what I understand, the former is the traditional reading of the book. Since Frankenstein played God, he was punished by his creation. He violated natural moral laws and he (and those around him) suffered the consequences. The references (both implicit and explicit) to physiognomy seem to point to this - the monster was simply a monster at heart, despite any hope we might hold out for him.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'm convinced that it wasn't just a literary tool in her hands. If so, she wielded it to great effect - I can easily imagine that my internal dialogue, my occasional sympathy for the monster's situation, was anticipated long ago. In my reading, there is no intrinsic evil in the monster's existence, even if Frankenstein himself sinned in bringing him into being.<br /><br />Instead, Frankenstein's primary sin was in casting out his creation based on physical appearance and on his place as a creature of a creature. Frankenstein's sin was a lack of love for the one he owed a duty of love to. Is this a purely modern reading, or is this what Shelley intended? I don't know, but I like to think she intended me to see it this way.<br /><br />Either way, the Frankenstein I thought I knew never forced me to ask the question. I'm glad I read this book.to. Is this a purely modern reading, or is this what Shelley intended?

B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this right after I finished reading The Hunger Games as I couldn't wait to see what President Snow had in store for Katniss Everdeen and was hooked for the start.
B000005RU2|5.0|This Live CD set was remastered at Abbey road, and mixed by Ian Paice and Roger Glover.The booklet is an essential item for reading with this masterwork ( even if it was primarily done for the LIVE IN JAPAN triple CD set).It explains the Made in Japan/Live in Japan difference, and covers other details, also including some great photos along the way.<br /><br /> 1. Highway Star : Superb Version , a great start to the CDs).<br /> 2.Child in Time : Great variations; Superb sounds ( crowd reaction, Brill !!)<br />  [Can even hear a mike stand fall what sounds like the reverb on a live mic.]<br />  A bizarre quote that i hope I have right is:<br />  \\"There is always someone smaller than you...<br />  There is always Somebody Taller than you...\\" [?]<br /> 3.Smoke on the Water;<br />  Gillan gives the intro. The Bass sounds fuller and distorted or at least like it has been boosted  by an octaver ( or is the Bass guitar given a D.I treatment or possibly a pedal ? ).<br />  The Keyboard and guitar exchange is great, very superb live treatment.<br /><br /> As an inbetween comment after Gillan asks for more Monitor, someone in the background says something, and<br />  Gillan seems to repeat it : \\" Everything Louder than Everything else\\", which is a conundrum like  comment  typical of Gillan.<br /> 4. The Mule. Excellent vehicle for Paice's drum solo. Works very well. Excellent end.<br /> 5. Strange Kind of Woman ; Superb Guitar Solo. and Great Vocal Sparring with Keyboard, Guitar et al.<br /> 6.Lazy: Amazing Keyboard intro, and the guitars work extra-ordinarily well as well ( Semi-Classical feel  for the guitar, and a kind of Jazz-fusion for Jon Lord's Keyboards.)<br /> 7.Space Trucking: After the main part of the song, the drums take it down, and Ritchie plays some Volume  Control Guitar, which is more likely done with volume knob touch rather than a pedal, and the Keyboard  emphasizes the touch behind the tone.<br /><br /> Disc 2.<br /> 8. Black Night: Awesome version.<br />9. Speed King; Keeps the Feeling going, an excellent Thumper.<br /> 10. Lucille: What a power song in the hands of expert players !! A brilliant end to the set.<br /><br />  [ I just started listening to DEEP PURPLE live at the BEEB, 1970, and though just in, its great, especially  for mono processed to stereo.AUGUST 27 Note: I Listened to DEEP PURPLE IN CONCERT 1970 and 1972( many times), what I call live at the BEEB, and the Double disc set is a perfect match for LIVE IN JAPAN.Fans will enjoy both of these sets.]

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. wonderful sounds and love how you can mix two together. Such a great find. would recommend to friends.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I'm going to attempt to write a review for this but in no way will I come near to doing it justice. It was just that great! I was drawn in and hooked from the very beginning. The historical/fantasy world was intricate and brilliantly described to the point that it impacted all of my senses; the frangrance of the oranges, the sounds of Neith, the touch of Silhara, the taste of Dragon Piss and the images of the Gift. The character development was flawless even with all their complexities.<br /><br />The story is enemies-to-lovers themed revolving around Silhara (H) and Martise (h). Silhara is a poor orange farmer and outcast mage known as the Master of Crows. His deep dark secret is that he is the reborn avatar to the god Corruption. Martise is a plain, servant slave loaned to Silhara for research and translations. (Actually she is there to earn her freedom by spying on Silhara and providing proof of his crimes of treachery and heresy) In return, he is supposed to help her Gift manifest. Um, I will just say that nothing went exactly as planned. Even with all the darkness, I loved their snarky wit and humerous banter. I actually found myself laughing so hard my eyes were watering. Also, the sexual tension between them was thick and the sex was scorching hot!<br /><br />I was too enamored with the story to highlight many quotes, but this one in particular affected me:<br /><br />\\"Did I please you?\\"<br />Silhara raised his head slowly to stare at her. High color flagged his cheekbones. His pupils swallowed the lighter black of his eyes. \\"Please me? You've vanquished me.\\"<br /><br />The story does end with a HEA but there is some angst along the way. It had some really intense moments and I had to take a few breaks near the end to settle my stomach and catch my breath. Just the thoughts of self sacrifice was making me nauseous. But this amazing love story was worth it.<br /><br />I loved this story and highly recommend it to everyone! It will not be one that I will soon forget. Plus, the current price is only $2.99!!!<br /><br />I think this might be the best book I've read all year!!!orget. Plus, the current price is only $2.99!!!<br /><br />I think this might be the best book I've read all year!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So there seems to be a lot of haters out there. I looked through 36 reviews and most of them were either two or three stars I would say she did a great job writing this book. And one more thing why did the people write/type such long reviews? I can read three Harry Potter books in one day if I stick to it, however, when I try to read your reviews I just get bored out of my mind! Besides if you can make a better book, then do it and stop complaining. I feel that Suzanne did a great job :)
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|TH1RT3EN will thrill anynbody like me who loves the music over the years. Still, it's not the maximum quality we have come to expect. A little tired and getting a little old. Needs some new sounds to bring it into this century.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is a pornographic romance novel in the vein of Beauty and the Beast.  Not very well written, but if you want a peek into an unknown world with quite a lot of steam . . .
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Where's the 3.01 update?<br />Play store already has it.<br />Can someone from SwiftKey please respond?<br />This is a popular app, with a rapidly growing customer based.<br />Timely updates are essential.<br /><br />Come on Amazon, it's the twenty first century for crying out loud...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the book/series. Its a must read I couldn't put it down. I wish there were more! Christin Grey is so intriguing!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I bought this book after watching the television series.  Longmire is the kind of character that has long been missing from modern day entertainment.  I love how the author tells the tale.  The pace is dead on perfect and I have a hard time putting it down.  The books are even better than the TV series but I recommend that anyone who has read this book watch the reruns.  He is a wonderful modern day sheriff.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes a down-to-earth hero.
B003LSU0K8|5.0|The watch arrived promptly, was brand new. It is a good dependable watch that does what is expected of it.
0545323126|5.0|My kids love these books.  We went to our local library to rent one of the titles and it was not available.  I decided to buy them...and it was a great investment!
B002VECM6S|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in many years and I have watched it 3 times and expect to watch it a lot more with friends that need to be enlightened by the message and spirit of the film.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wasn't quite what I expected. A little more graphic than I realized from the sample and quite s bit different from what I normally read. Liked it well enough to move on to the second book though.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Errol Morris is an intellectual giant, and in this documentary he introduces us to the confusion that surrounds war, and the doubts, uncertainties and fears that float around in the brains of men saddled with incredible power and responsibility, in this case former U.S. Secretary of State Robert S. McNamara.<br /><br />For more fodder on what a waste of time, life and resources the Vietnam War was, Rick says check it out.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|the action and suspense of this movie is mind blowing from start to end. truly its 1 of the best action movies i ever saw in a very long time. of course the u.s. is gonna have its version soon. cant wait to see part 2 which the director will e working on soon.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Quit killing off the good characters! Good book but so many characters and ongoing subplots makes it difficult to keep everyone straight.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Okay, I know Disney likes to distance themselves from this film because of questionable language and other unimportant things. This blu-ray better come with more than a working Title Menu...meaning special features! (behind the scenes, commentary from at least one of the cast members), deleted scenes, outtakes, and whatever you have. You are Disney, you can make anything possible. No excuses. Thank you. BTW: It's a classic.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Epic Epic Epic. Love the world building aspect and the character of Kaladin.<br /><br />Also fan of:<br />The dark tower<br />A game of thrones<br />Lord of the rings<br /><br />If you liked those this won't dissappoint!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is the best game on here. this game wont give you any problems or freeze you kindle. the best game ever
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was reacquainted with Sully (Joe Lando) in Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman on reruns through our local cable company. It was hard just seeing random ones not being in order, so I found the Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman: Complete Series on Amazon and bought it. Great price and it is has been wonderful watching the series in order and re-watch my favorite episodes. The Complete Series also included the two movies made after the series was canceled.  I purchased it primarily because of Sully!!! :) Joe was a perfect fit to play Sully!!  The story lines and all the cast are wonderful.  I really enjoy the historical facts that they work into the shows. This was a great investment!!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|great app.... lots you can do! easy to manipulate photos just like on your pc. very handy. recommend highly. get it!
0439023513|5.0|Despite the pessimistic reviews, I thought this book was great. A little bit too sci-fi (it started going a bit 'Aliens'-like towards the end), but an enjoyable book all the same.<br /><br />Oh, but with Peeta... I couldn't stop crying. The thought of losing him (his mind, not actually him) and how lovely he was... I spent quite a lot of it balling my eyes out. I think that was what made it a good book for me, that I felt I could empathise with Katniss better and feel soppy over Peeta. I think the first book worked best, as it plot line was the best and might not have enjoyed the last as much if Peeta hadn't got me all welled up, but all was good in the end.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's a great way to calm my brain so I can fall asleep.  I like the timer feature a lot. I hate waking to a kindle with a dead battery.
0439023521|5.0|I have never been so in awe of an author in my life (admittedly it isn't a spectacularly long one). I set myself up to be freaked out and put off by the violence but it wasn't like that at all.<br /><br />Set in future North America in a country called Panen, Katniss Everdeen, a girl of 16, spends her days providing for her mother and sister in a place called District 12. The book is set around an annual event called the Hunger Games, in which  a boy and girl from each of the 12 districts in Panem are set into an arena to fight to the death and watched on live TV. This is as payment to the Capitol, the city in Panem, after the districts rebelled 74 years previously.<br /><br />After Katniss' sister is called up to fight at the Reaping, she volunteers to take her place and is delivered off to the Capitol to be prepared, knowing only one person can survive.<br /><br />Now I had the idea that the area would be some kind of gladiator ring, or just out in the wilderness. I didn't realise that Capitol had complete control over the arena, rigging up certain areas to pose more dangers to the tributes. It worked really well and added more danger that made the chance of survival remote. In fact, it wasn't at all what I expected, which made it all the more better - I hadn't imagined the book would be like it is at all.<br /><br />The structure of the book may take some getting used to but it works really well and compliments the first person style. I loved the humour in the book and felt like I was living in the arena with Katniss and the other tributes. It pulled me in and I read each book one after another. And then again. And again.<br /><br />I loved these books soooo much and wish I could unread them, just to get the privilege of reading them again! If you haven't read them yet, I would definitely try now, especially if you haven't seen the film. The book is a lot better and really worth the read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was awsome! I couldn't put it down, for a second!<br />When I was done, I nearly cried! now I have nothing good to read.
030758836X|5.0|I downloaded the audio book from my library (very well narrated).  Be careful reading reviews because there are lots of twists and you might read something that gives away too much.  The characters are more intriguing than lovable and the story is, for the most part, unpredictable. I see a lot of reviews saying the ending was awful but I thought it was well done.  The story didn't end abruptly; it was just so good that I wanted more.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The only thing this book has going for it is remarkable marketing. Seems unfair so much money can be made from such talentless writing.
0345803485|1.0|So I guess most men's wives get all excited after reading this book. My poor husband got an earful of feminist rants.<br /><br />Am I the only one disturbed by the -extreme- inequality between the female and male protagonists?<br /><br />Her heroine is Tess of the d'Urbervilles for God's sake. Really? Now I related to Tess when I was maybe 15-16 but not in my 20s.<br /><br />If it's the hot sex in the book that people like, I get that, but there is no reason why the protagonist had to come into the relationship with no power, with nothing. She doesn't even know how to dress. And no computer or e-mail address? In 2011??<br /><br />I have -no desire- to go back to being broke and naive and can't understand why women my age have gone crazy over these books.
034580404X|3.0|I hated the first book. The second one was better. The third one was my favorite. I feel like the author has improved in writing the books.
B006RXQ800|3.0|This is a review of the product and how the movie is split up into two discs.  I bought this movie because I like it so the movie obviously gets 5 stars.  Great actors and some historical truth to it like the name at least of that corrupt mayor.  It's a movie and it never claimed to be a documentary.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I would like to play this game...but every time it force closes on me after like 15 seconds. if it would stop doing that I think I would enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy on the eyes.  I am glad my husband found this for me.  This app has been so helpful since I have been handling the books for an outing.
B008MM9630|5.0|great game. I love that you don't need the Internet to play. its super fun I love all the cute little animals
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This set of 5 audio CD's contains the information to truly transform a persons thinking and thus their life.  Rhonda Bryne shares beautiful stories, inspiring music, and amazing details in one of the most powerful presentations I've ever been privleged to hear.  It's truly wonderful to be able to listen over and over again, to enjoy every minute detail and become the very best that you can be in your life!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|It's campy, shticky, deadpan. I loved it. If you're expecting a serious drama, or mainly a love story, you'll be disappointed. I was expecting more of a love story (I grew up watching the Dark Shadows remake of the 90s), but when I figured out what the movie was meant to be, I dropped my expectations and just went with it. Burton and Depp give a nod to the overacting and over-makeup of the silent film era and a nod to the kitschy 60s and 70s era with a subtly twisted humor. Vampires, lava lamps, funky 70s earrings, an exploding fish cannery, and Alice Cooper... what's not to like, lol?
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|This movie was really horrible considering how much hype Disney made about it coming out. The movie is almost nothing like the book and the whole idea that they put behind was poor. Felt like I was watching a ghetto sci-fi movie you see on Syfy channel. Not worth my $5 in theater and definitely not worth paying more than $1 for.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|My first thoughts after watching this film was not particularly positive. I thought it was too long. However I could not get the film out of my mind. Images from the film kept appearing in my head. A second viewing made me realize why the film was one of the Best Picture nominations for 2011. As with other Best Picture nominations, academy members are attracted to and recognize high quality filmmaking. There should be no doubt that 'War Horse' qualifies as an example of outstanding production and acting. In lesser hands, 'War Horse' would have been an average attempt at epic filmmaking, but Spielberg is an artist and it shows in this production of beautifully staged set pieces.<br /><br />'War Horse' is a film about a rural English family in the early part of the Twentieth Century that buys a thoroughbred horse that they name Joey for an exorbitant price that they cannot afford. They also needed a quarter horse, a work horse, and not a race horse for farm work. The young son of the family convinces his parents that he can make the horse productive and help save the farm. His efforts fail and Joey is sold to the army at the beginning of WW I. The son, Albert, vows that he and Joey will someday be reunited. We then follow Joey through 4 years of war and different owners.<br /><br />Joey is the centerpiece of an episodic plot line which is how the original book and play was presented. Some film goers may be turned off by this. But if they look at the film in terms of plot they are missing what this film is really about. This is a film about a horse and the lives of the people he influences. There is no romance, no sex. This is a PG-13 film. War violence is present but understated. Several times, the camera looks away or conceals by foreground objects scenes that would have earned the film an 'R' rating. This is a film that could have been filmed as an historical epics of the 1960's. The retro feel of the film is just what this movie is about. Spielberg set out to create a 1960's-like film such as one that might have been made by David Lean.<br /><br /> The film is old fashioned in that it takes its time to tell the story. No digital camera here. It was all filmed on celluloid. No CGI except for a brief animal scene. All animal scenes are real. The camera lingers on every scene.The pastoral beauty of Southwestern England and the trenches of WW I is captured without digital fakery.<br /><br />I recommend this film as one of the best of 2011.e a 1960's-like film such as one that might have been made by David Lean.<br /><br /> The film is old fashioned in that it takes its time to tell the story.

B001FB5634|5.0|I don't recall why I watched this film. I abhor sad films. I prefer to watch films that entertain or take me away from it all. This film didn't do either, at least not in the way I've come to expect. This is the scariest film I have ever seen. Why? Because it can happen and it is so realistically done.<br />In The Road, somehow, the world as we know it has come to an end. What occurred is never revealed. A couple go to bed on the end of a beautiful, sunny day and wake up in the middle of the night to strange voices outside and fires are visibly glowing outside their draped windows. The woman gives birth to a son and for about nine (?) years they live closed up in their home. Finally, things come to a head as the real journey to survive begins.<br />Outside, all the world appears to have gone up in flames. The world has turned upside down. People have turned cannaballistic and murderous. Laws no longer exist. The sun no longer shines. Everything has died: the trees... the grass... the animals.<br />This is a tragic film. This is a drama. This is a horror film at its basic level. If you like to be entertained, or watch a film to escape life, don't watch this one. If you want to see humanity at its worst, or best in crisis, I can recommend this film without hesitation.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I must say that I can't wait for the next one.  How much longer do I have to? I really quite enjoyed this one.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW COMPLETED 11/20/11.<br />One word to describe my feelings about this book: OBSESSED. I love this book every time I re-read it! I literally couldn't put the book down the first time I read it and finished it in one night. The title describes the book accurately. This story is different than anything that I've read. It's not your typical girl meets bad boy scenario. Abby and Travis have a passionate, dysfunctional, explosive, yet endearing relationship that you can't help but become consumed by. Jamie McGuire sucks you into this phenomenal story and takes you on a wild ride.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy starts college with one goal in mind: a brand new start. She wants to leave her old life behind and her best friend, America, is there to help her. I loved the relationship Abby had with America. They really looked out for each other and had a genuine friendship. As she and America settle in to college life, Abby didn't expect to meet the campus bad boy and fall for him. I really fell in love with Abby and Travis. Even after reading this book 4 times, I still get frustrated with Abby, but I do understand her.<br /><br />Travis Maddox. Just saying his name makes me SWOON. Travis is a tough guy, but he's also smart. He makes his living at night in a college fight ring and spends his days as a college co-ed. He is the object of desire for all the ladies on campus. He's covered in tattoos and gives off a devil may care attitude. That is, until he meets Abby. I don't think he ever expected to fall for Abby. After a few rounds of serious flirtation, Travis makes a bet with Abby. When Abby loses the bet, both of their lives are changed forever. I loved seeing how their relationship developed. You can literally feel their passion for each other and there is such a deep connection between these characters that you can't help but root for them.<br /><br />I am such an enormous fan of Beautiful Disaster and am thrilled to share my love for this book. Not only is Beautiful Disaster among the top five books I recommend, but the book and Travis are among the top all-time searches leading to my blog. That makes me do a happy dance every time I see it.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire has created a work of art. She's developed an addictive story and truly memorable characters. I look forward to  Jamie's future projects. When I found out there was going to be a book written in Travis' perspective, I nearly fell off the couch. I'd also like to see more of the Maddox Brothers. After I read Walking Disaster of course!tiful Disaster among the top five books I recommend, but the book and Travis are among the top all-time searches leading to my blog.

B0016OLC5Q|2.0|This is the worst movie ever! I can't believe the main character didn't jump on the jailbait when he had the chance. If he doesn't agree with society and society's laws then he must have not agree to the underage law of 18. He is a freaking hypocrite! I wanted to see some action not homosexual singing on the stage. What a fool! That poor girl. She must have felt like unwanted and ugly when she was rejected after throwing herself at him. He got what was coming to him at the end. Stupid idiot.

B002ZG997M|5.0|Literally one of my favorite movies, has a great story and some surprising twists, the acting and fight scenes are great!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Simply put, this movie is beautiful. The plot, the animation, everything is like a moving work of art. I won't get into the plot since it seems other reviewers have already done so, but I highly recommend you buy this movie. I first watched it online for free and loved it so much I decided to buy it. This is the type of movie anyone will like, even if they aren't hardcore anime fans (like me). Watch it by yourself or with the whole family! So many movies nowadays have no deeper meaning, or are simply newer versions of older movies (I think we can agree that Hollywood is running out of ideas), but this movie really touched my heart.<br /><br />For some reason, I really like the DVD itself. It has a cardboard overlay that displays the characters as they are in Oz, and then the DVD package shows the characters as they are in real life. The inside has a family snapshot, and the CDs each have a very cute character icon. On packaging alone I'm sold!<br /><br />But seriously, buy this DVD. You will not regret it.

0547569653|5.0|The mix of technique, stories and dietary advice is the most useful part of this book.  In addition, it is highly entertaining.  This is a must read for every runner, no matter what distance you prefer.  This is a must read for anyone interested in diet, no matter herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore.  Most books on running are either great stories or great tips.  This has both and is a must read for any athlete or armchair athlete.<br /><br />Scott is an inspiration in so many ways and over the years we have only heard short stories about who he is.  This book gives a great insight into him and how each of us can overcome whatever is put in our way!<br /><br />Thanks Scott for writing this book.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|This new version of Clash of the Titans over shadow the original one.

Love it Love it, Clash of the Titans vs Prince of Persia for me I loveeeeeeeee me some Jake, means Prince is my #1 pick but it's a close race though.<br /><br />FYI I just seen it's a Part2 on the Titans titled Wrath of the Titans&lt;&lt;&lt; I must get it asap!

B00127RAJY|5.0|Great Workout! I am a new mom with a baby who takes very short naps so I don't have a whole lot of time to workout. This video is awesome because I get a good, sweaty workout in while she takes one of her 30 minute naps. I love the workouts because they are constantly changing things up so I don't get bored with doing the same old move. I have many workout videos but this one is my favorite and the one I recommend the most.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was relectant about reading this book but after being influenced by everyone around me I finally agreed to read it, and boy was I shocked at the fact that I could not put it down. I was hooked, I would recommend it to anyone , the story is very good and the chemistry between both characters is something all girls only can dream about, Im anxious in finishing the other books!

0375869026|5.0|Wonder is about this boy named August, who was born with a birth defect.  He was born with a cleft palate, which is a face deformity. I liked how he got to be a strong person in the middle of the book when he started going to a real school. He was not able to go to a regular school as a child because he had twenty-seven surgeries so he couldn't go to school. I also liked how people had stuck up for him, when people talked bad about his face. He couldn't help that his face was like that. There were parts in the book when things were sad. One sad part was when August's dog died. Another sad part had to do with a student, named Julian, who marked out August's face in any school pictures. The main characters are August, Jack Will, Julian, Via, Miranda, and Summer.  The main characters do a lot in the story. They all have a section in the book telling the story from their perspectives. A few questions that I would ask the author are: what if August never went to school?  How would the story have started or ended? Would it be better or worse?  How would August get along with others if he did not go to school with other kids? This book reminded me of \\"Marley and Me\\" just because the dog died after getting sick. It was a good movie but parts of the book and movie had both sad and happy parts. The author could have put more information in it because this book was very good and it was interesting. I wish everyone would read this book because the story was so good. The most embarrassing moment for August was when he was in the cafeteria eating and because of his disorder he chewed weird so people looked at him. Via is August's sister, and she is a great older sister. She has a boyfriend named Justin, and Justin was very nice to August whenever he saw him. August was partners with Jack Will in science and they got an \\"A\\" on their project. Jack Will has never gotten an \\"A\\" before. Jack and August became good friends. August LOVES star wars and knows everything about them. He hashad a roaring noise in his ears his whole life and when he got hearing aids it was so much better. One day august went on a school trip for two nights and he was nervous about it, but he went, and they sat by a camp fire and roasted marshmallows. The next night they went to watch the \\"Sound of Music\\" and Jack had to go to the bathroom, so August went with him.  The line was too long so they walked in the woods. Then this group of people came and they were making fun of August's face. Julian's friends, Amos, Henry, and Miles came, but Julian didn't come on the trip. One of Julian's friends punched the guy that was teasing August. August's sweat shirt was like tug-a-war one person was pulling on one side and one pulling on the other. August, Jack, Amos, Henry, and Miles were running and they finally got away and they were in a corn field. August had lost his hearing aids and they found their way back to the movie. Then went home and the school said they would pay for August's hearing aids. The next day they had an award ceremony for school.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Woo-hoo!  Now I can take my favorite time-killer site with me to the kitchen or the, uh, reading room, or just enjoy Pinterest while I'm watching TV.  Heck, who needs TV?  Thanks to another reviewer I was able to find the app on my Kindle Fire app store page (search for \\"Pinterest\\" - one word - and scroll 'way down) and get it installed.  It's easy to log in, browse (scroll left to see categories, center for current activity, right for your own activity and link to your profile), scroll through and see pins, link to their source, see other people's pages, follow them, re-pin, like, and comment. There's a \\"Create pin\\" link at the top, too.  Couldn't see a way to edit my own information, but that's certainly not a necessity and I may have overlooked it.  Overall, love it!  If you can't get my attention online, just flag me down on Pinterest since I'll probably be spending even more time there from now on.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />I really enjoyed a lot this book, it is very nice written. With a plot line that involves you from the very first pages. I love the political issues and conspiracies. It has very real characters that you will love or hate. I recommend it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Absolutely the one of the worst books that I have ever read !!!<br />  Certainly not interested in the two sequels and am so sorry that I have contributed<br />to this authors best seller status!!!<br />Very badly written, no depth, and sex for the sake of sales.The author is no doubt laughing all<br />the way to the bank.<br />  Such a shame when there are so many other amazing and talented authors out there<br />  who are not having the same success.<br />  I will in future trust my instincts and not believe media hype!!!!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Great animation as well as descriptions for various uses.  I also love the optional views and a favorites.  Got it for free,  but would have definitely paid for something like this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. This series has a gravity that pulls you in and keeps you there. On several occasions my roommate nearly had to remove the Kindle from my lap by force to make me go outside. The attention Hugh gives to all his characters is a breath of fresh air to me. I hate books that immediately fall stagnant, whether it is because of bad dialogue, or that the author ceased caring for his story -- feeling bored, just wanted it to end... This book, on the other hand, intrigued me and had me craving more from the very first page to its last.
1468161660|4.0|The story works...the characters are believable and likeable...it kept me turning the pages well after 11 pm...found myself looking forward to reading it...<br /><br />I began this book with low expectations and frankly, the mindset that most of the positive reviewers had a low threshold for good reading.  What a nice surprise to find that I enjoyed the story just as much as everyone said they did!<br /><br />I didn't care for the book format (large size - didn't fit in my hands very well, weird page design - the paragraphs were too broadly spaced and not flush) and I didn't care for the way the poetry was outlined (lots of bold lettering, many cascading paragraphs) but really that is all secondary to the story.  I liked it very much, was a little disappointed in the ending, and am now looking into the sequel.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This movie is a follow up to the Firefly series that was canceled before its time. I would rate this movie as one of my top 10 favorites of all time. The characters are engaging and believable. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It has moments where you want to stand up and cheer, moments of laughter, and moments of sadness all mixed in a very good way.  The effects, set design, costumes, locations, and props were all extremely well done.<br /><br />In full disclosure though, I did see the series before the movie so the characters were known to me.  In my humble opinion, if they had continued this to more movies, it would have been better than Star Wars and Star Trek and just about anything else.  This is, I believe, is Joss Whedons greatest work.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't normally do reviews for anything, but this was bad enough that I needed to warn people.<br /><br />I gave up reading this book at 20%.  The story was going no where, and was horribly written! The author gives ridiculous analogies for everything in the book! It is impossible to keep up with what is going on when she decribes how every character walks, holds their hands, breaths...
0345803485|3.0|The book is just...okay.  I read it and got so tired of the sex (shock).  It was expected in this book (obviously), but it just became a bit redundant.  Other than that, I liked it.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've now been listening to the album for over two months, and as I learn its nuances it just gets better and better. As several other reviewers have noted, how many bands have been around for nearly 40 years and are still exploring, getting better musically in terms of both technical skill and in composition (not to mention selling out concerts just about anywhere they play?). You can count them on one digit. They are THE power trio, and it is really amazing that three guys can create such amazing music like this, let along perform it.<br />The album cover shows a clock with alchemy and other symbols representing each of the songs, with time a central theme. The entire album tells a story - a mega-epic of over 70 minutes, but each song can still stand on its own, musically if not lyrically.<br /><br />1. Caravan starts off the story in what's become a standard Rush practice of having the most iconic song up front on the album- it's a tribute to the youthful longing for adventure and getting-out-of-dodge. A young man wants to escape the safe, secure farm where he grew up. It has a great stop-time riff for the verses, an anthemic chorus somewhat reminiscent of Dreamline on Roll the Bones, and an instrumental break/bridge section that just flat out kicks ass to hear (and to see live on the Time Machine tour video). Three top-notch musicians playing off of and supporting the others with a chemistry matched by few other groups.<br /><br />2. BU2B has a very brief acoustic guitar and haunting voice intro before kicking into a pounding riff punctuated by a steam venting sound effect (which they match with their steampunk stage setup on tour). The song talks about the predominant beliefs of the society the protagonist was raised in - a very fatalistic belief system that kept anyone from questioning what they were `brought up to believe.' The liner notes teaser for the song talks about the omniscient Watchmaker who ruled  Crown City, the capital the protagonist travelled to,with alchemist-priests (vaguely like the priests in 2112) providing for every need. Not a very subtle hint at Neil's, and probably Geddy and Alex's disdain for organized religion and contempt for those who never question anything. The same attitude is shared by the protagonist as he learns more about life in the big city. Musically the song has a melody that doesn't seem like much initially but quickly gets stuck in your head. No extensive solos in this one, just solid rock.<br /><br />3. Clockwork Angels takes the protagonist to the center of Crown City, to Chronos Square (noticing the theme of time again?) where he sees the aforementioned Clockwork Angels - floating globes representing Light, Sea, Sky and Land - basically the four elements. They are the visible symbols worshipped by those in the city, but even they are beholden to the unseen Watchmaker. The music has a majestic sound to it that complements the reverence held for the Angels - punctuated by a mocking bridge section with Geddy's voice distorted as he sings they lyrics - a partial Biblical quote `Lean not upon your own understanding' which is attributed in the liner notes to \\"Proverbs 3:5 (and In-N-Out milkshake!)\\" and again mocks the fatalism of those in this perfectly ordered society.<br /><br />4. No ordered society is complete without a villain - The Anarchist. The rhythmic, lively music to me contrasts sharply with the dark character in the lyrics.  To me it speaks of a deeply held contempt for the sort of behavior demonstrated by the worst of the pseudo-Marxist-nihilist idiots who seemed to infest OWS protests in larger cities last year.<br />`I lack their smiles and their diamonds, I lack their happiness and love - I envy them for all those things, I never got my fair share of<br />`The lenses inside of me that paint the world black, the pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage'<br />Anyway, the Anarchist could be a Heath Ledger's Joker-esque character, consumed by hate andenvy, who just wants to spread chaos through the city, but again the music is an interesting contrast to that.<br /><br />5. In the fifth song, Carnies, the protagonist has taken a job working on a carnival (kinda like Neil did when he was young) and one night amidst the busy crowds, games, dancers and performers, he spots the Anarchist planting a bomb, and just as he shouts to warn the crowd, the villain throws the detonator to him and disappears. The crowds assume the protagonist is the guilty party and he's forced to flee the city. The music starts off with an ominous sounding riff alternating with a lighter section that builds tension. The chorus is built around the idea that you should be careful what you wish for...<br />`How I prayed just to get away, to carry me anywhere<br />Sometimes the angels punish us, by answering our prayers.'<br /><br />6. Halo Effect backtracks a bit (or it's the protagonist reminiscing) and introduces a little bit of love story - even if it turns out badly. It's a short ballad, barely over three minutes, led by Alex with a melancholy acoustic guitar on the verses. The protagonist becomes obsessed with a beautiful acrobat performer who doesn't share his feelings, and he has to come to terms with the fact that he was just projecting his vision of a perfect soulmate onto the object of his infatuation - to be disappointed when she doesn't comes close.<br />`It's so shameful to tell<br />Just how often I fell<br />In love with illusions again'<br /><br />7. In the next song the protagonist makes his way to the rough port city of Poseidon. `Seven Cities of Gold' plays off of the old Spanish legend - the unreachable untold cities of riches always forever just beyond reach, but tortuously visible past a brutal wilderness described in the lyrics and Hugh Syme's artwork that resembles the four corners area (only colder). The protagonist of course hears the stories and has to try to find them, spending who knows how many months or years, andends up nearly freezing to death before having to return to Poseidon.<br /><br />8. In The Wreckers the protagonist believes his luck has run out and catches a ship back home. He's tired, a bit older, and has had his fill of adventure. They get caught in a vicious storm at sea and get lost, and when they see a signal light they believe they're saved by some Samaritans. But, it turns out it's a trap to get ships to run aground so the wreckers can plunder the cargos and leave the poor passengers to drown in the waves. Musically, the verses have a melody that reflects the tragedy of the passengers' shattered hope, with a chorus that reflects the protagonists growing disillusionment.<br />'All I know it that sometimes you have to be wary<br />Of a miracle to good to be true<br />All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary<br />Everything in life you thought you knew<br />All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary<br />Cause sometimes the target is you'<br />The protagonist is the only survivor of the doomed voyage.<br /><br />9. Headlong Flight has the protagonist, presumably back home and safe, reminiscing again about all the adventures he's had, and in spite of how bad things may have seen from time to time, that they all helped make him the person he became. The chorus contains a tribute to Neil's mentor Freddy Gruber...the real test of a life well-lived is whether you would do it all again. Musically this is the most kick-ass song on the album, starting out with a killer bass riff from Geddy before launching into a rocking 7-minute fast-tempo song that shows off Geddy, Alex and Neil's jaw-dropping chops...it is going to be a blast to watch them play this one live!<br /><br />10. BU2B2 is a short acoustic reprise of the first one, but from a protagonist who's older, disillusioned, but wiser, and despite still having the same disdain for the fatalists and their unquestioning beliefs, he realizes his own refusal to share in their beliefs and his desire tocontinue living his own way in spite of all the challenges he's faced is itself a reflection of a kind of faith.<br /><br />11. Wish Them Well is a lesson the protagonist tries to teach - how you can't let those who don't agree with, dislike or hate become a driving factor in your life. Those who are evil, mean, stupid or nasty simply aren't worth spending any more of your energy than needed to get away and get them out of your life. (There's too much other cool stuff to do!)<br />`Spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy, always angry and dissatisfied; even the lost ones, the frightened and mean ones, even the ones with a devil inside. Thank your stars you're not that way, turn your back and walk away; don't even pause and ask them why.\\"<br />Not as fast-paced as Headlong Flight, it has easy pace and an uplifting sound that reminds me a bit of some songs on the Presto album (but without that album's tinny sound.<br /><br />12. The final song, The Garden: I think it's the most beautiful song Rush has ever written. It floored me. Musically it has Geddy starting out singing the lyrics to an almost folk-sounding melody that's not quite like anything they've done in any of their more `ballad-y' songs over the years, with Alex playing an acoustic in support. Then it builds with bass and then Neil joining in on the drums, and then it incorporates some piano and orchestral parts. It has Geddy's best singing on the album, and closes out with a gorgeous solo from Alex. The lyrics provide the finale to the theme of time and the unseen Watchmaker behind the scenes. As his final lesson the protagonist realizes that the meaning of his life boiled down to a quest for two very simple things. From the liner note intro to the song:<br />\\"Long ago I read a story from another timeline about a character named Candide. He also survived a harrowing series of misadventures and tragedies, then settled on a farm near Constantinople. Listening to a philosophical rant, Candide replied \\"That's all very well, but now we must tend our garden.\\" I have now arrived at that point in my own story. There is a metaphorical garden in the acts and attitudes of a person's life, and the treasures of that garden are love and respect. I have come to realize that the gathering of love and respect - from others and for myself - has been the real quest of my life. `Now we must tend our garden.'\\"<br /><br />It is a stunning song - I found myself playing this one several times through.<br /><br />Considering several of the songs individually this would seem like a very dark album, but as a whole I find the story and the music as uplifting and inspiring as any I've ever heard. Its lesson is that if you've gone through life without experiencing its tough times, its tragedies and disappointments, you'll only be a fraction of what you could be. Life is about overcoming all of those things.<br />One of the biggest criticisms about epic songs like Rush has done in the past is that they are not casually listenable. I don't think any of these are that way - musically each one can stand alone, even if you don't understand its place in the larger story, the choruses on almost all of them deal with universal themes. Will it be too much for some fans or blunt the growth of their fanbase from being overly complex or intellectual? I doubt it.<br /> I really hope they play this entire album in concert, but given that they've only played the 20-minute 2112 epic on one tour in their careers, playing this 70+ minute magnum opus is probably too much to hope for. But damn, that would be an amazing thing to experience.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|I ran across Gregory Porter's CD and the cover caught my attention. Just based on the his photo, I deceided to listen. I am so glad that I did. I am now a huge fan. I started listening in my car on the way to work. I thought that I could finish listening at work at my desk. Oh no... I began to get emotional. I had to finish listening after work in my car. I listened to this CD on a 6 hour road trip out of state. Made my trip so enjoyable. It seemed like I'd gotten to my destination faster than normal. Gregory's voice is so strong and pure. With a voice like his, he doesn't need to do runs or any other tricks. The CD Water is great too!

Poor writing, acting, plot, characters and more.  If that weren't bad enough, the 3D version only has 3D in the opening credits and closing credits.  The rest can be viewed comfortable in 2D.  Don't waste your money buying this one, unless your a porn/gore enthusiast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A very good read. And well worth the money. Could not put it down till the last book. Must buy!
140131046X|5.0|First let me say I listened to this on CD while driving to an appointment for my job a state away.  I liked this so much that I'm online debating whether to get it for my Kindle or in paperback.  I picked it up knowing I'd really enjoyed your other books, but nothing prepared me for how this one spoke to me.  I also do not consider myself devout and although I believe in God, do not like the negative aspects of organized religion.  I tell myself relgion starts wars, pits people of different faiths against one another and involves too much wealth when God has no need of money.<br /><br />That being said, this book and what you learned along with the conversations with \\"The Reb\\" and the christian minister really made me stop and think about religion and what it means.  I loved what the rabbi had to say about the questions Mitch asked, because these are my questions, too.  I've never had them addressed with such honesty and candor.<br /><br />Thank you Mitch for writing this book. It truly touched my soul and spoke to me as nothing else ever has on this complex and controversial subject of faith and God.
