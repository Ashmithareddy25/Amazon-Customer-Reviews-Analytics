0553208845|5.0|speaking as an indian , I have seldom read a book which conveys the essence of hinduism more succintly than Siddartha ,shows the entire connection of the universal spirit of life ,the unity of all things and maybe you could find the answer to existence itself here ,if you read carefully enough!
0345315227|1.0|If anyone suggests you read this book, just say NO!  Why?  How about: NO plot, NO characterization, NO answers, NO drama, NO tension, and above all:  NO sense of wonder!  Of all the books I would  have loved to see convey a sense of wonder over the mysteries of the universe, this would be it.  A very disappointing Cincinnati-to-San-Francisco-on-Delta read
0345377370|4.0|LeCarre does a pretty good job of making a complex story somewhat followable.  Some parts are confusing, everything is the opposite of what you think it is, sometimes the opposite of that, but it all comes together in the end.  One helluva surprise in the end.  Worth reading just for the end
0684874350|4.0|The whole time I was reading this moving tale I just wished I could be there to fix him a nice meal. Loved the book but heard the misery of his life was highly embellished and, please, does anyone really have such vivid memories of being three and four
0060175184|4.0|This book is, in my opinion, not as good as Kane and Abel and A Matter of Honour, but none- theless, it's worth reading. This is an exciting  story in the good-old-Jeffrey Archer-style.
0517591812|5.0|If you have a love of everything  British, then this book is for you.  Yes, it's long, and yes, there are a lot of characters to keep up with, but I felt it was worth it.    I know I will read this book several more times.  I have used the internet to help me keep the lines of the monarchy straight, and I have also found pictures of important sites.  It's been like doing an independent study course!  I just loved it
0440131480|5.0|Poo-tee-tweet?  Let me ask you one question.  What would you ask your creator, if given the chance?   Vonnegut gives us his best writing and insight, in this incredible Novel.  The characters are brilliant, the setting is clear, and I now believe, that humans, are indeed robots.  Machines.    oh, to be young again.
0679745203|5.0|<br />  &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a momentous turning point in English letters. Don't look at these statements in dismay, dear reader. &quot;It is only a book,&quot; you're saying?  Only a book... Only words...<br />  \\"Words, Carravagio. They have a power.\\" This quote sums up the main theme of the book. It is a homage to words. A tribute to the unarmed devastation words, books, literature can wreak in a person's life. They shatter worlds only to rebuild them in their own image. <BR>   Translation. Ondaatje uses this word a lot. What are books, but translations of life? And all those references to books; all those references to words... Ondaatje, himself, is a participant in this story. He is the ubiquitous magus, reinventing words, adorning them in the stardust of boundless imagination. By putting words through the dance steps of his own invention, he makes them stand out in a new light. Brilliant choreography, custom-made for his favourite ballerina -- language. The book screams of his love. The book reverberates with his powerful, yet tender presence.<BR>   There are other themes. War. The war waged by the outside world against our souls. Healing. The process of healing the wounds of our souls to discover our true identity under the thick scabs of scars. Foreign lands. Where familiarity stops being a buffer between us and our demons, but where, through facing those demons, we are free to shed the accoutrements of roots and expectations and to reinvent ourselves in our own image.<BR>   Yet through all this, there is an underlying melody of Time and Words. Sometimes enemies. Sometimes allies. Words in time. Words through time. Timeless words. Time is a river, carrying the barges of books with their immortal passengers -- words.<br />   Perhaps not everyone will recognize the importance of this novel immediately. Perhaps our society  must breathe through the realization of its impact. Amid artists who throw paint on the canvas of their works with reservation, Michael Ondaatje has the audacity and the bold strokes of an accomplished and confident Master. In the literary world full of brilliant followers, Ondaatje stands out as a profound innovator. It is inevitable, that in time &quot;The English Patient&quot; will become universally accepted as the little novel that shook the world.
0440131480|5.0|This novel, Goodbye Blue Monday, is among the finest literay pieces, I have ever read.  Anything, and everything, which is great about Vonnegut, is in this book.  Great characters, satire, sex, and sci-fi.  After reading this, I feel the same as Dwayne Hoover, that everyone IS a robot, and they must be taken down.  Poo-tee-weet?  Make me young!  Make me young!  Tell me one thing, what would you ask your creator, if given the chance
044651506X|4.0|Everything that has been said is true.  The story is predictalbe and the boat ride in the hurricane is a bit far fetched.  The one-liners are funny but a bit overused.  But guess what.  I enjoyed it.... I have been going through &quot;withdrawal pains&quot; waiting for this book.  It was not as action riveting as Cathedrel , By The Waters of Babylon and The Talbot Odyssey, nor as stirring and frightening as The Charm School or as funny as the Gold Coast and not as compelling as Word of Honor. But  It is as enjoyable as Generals Daughter and Spencerville .  I can't wait for his next book which I understand will be taking us back to Vietnam.  Write fast!!
0312955006|5.0|I selected this novel, a bit disappointed that I couldn't get my hands on a new Lucas Davenport mystery from John Sandford.  But all disappointment vanished within five minutes of beginning The Concrete Blonde.  It's everything a mystery/detective/suspense reader loves.  If you're looking for something totally absorbing, a real page-turner that may keep you up all night to finish it, then this is for you!  Truly imaginitive, uniquely creative, it makes you want to get started on another as soon as you put this one down.  Having read Black Ice, Last Coyote, and the Poet, I can honestly say that Michael Connelly is &quot;first class,&quot;  right up there with the best of his genre. Being an attorney myself, I am usually completely turned of by phony courtroom scenes and by a generally lousy grip of the law that many mystery writers seem to share.  But not so here.  I think I actually learned something!  It's a must read for any mystery lover
0887307396|5.0|&quot;Built to Last&quot; is one of those rare non-fiction books you just can't put down.  Unequivocally the best &quot;business&quot; book I have ever read, &quot;Built to Last&quot; by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras is a compelling, thorough, well-written, unprecedented look at what it takes to &quot;create and achieve long-lasting greatness as a visionary corporation.&quot;  Unlike many current &quot;trendy&quot; management and &quot;business success&quot; books out on the market, Collins and Porras differentiate &quot;Built to Last&quot; by using their own six-year comprehensive, well-documented research study as the basis for further analysis.<br />    What separates &quot;Built to Last&quot; is that each visionary company (3M, HP, Procter &amp; Gamble, Wal-Mart...) is contrasted with a comparison company founded in the same time, in the same industry, with similar founding products and markets (Norton, TI, Colgate, Ames...).  Perhaps what I found most intriguing were some of the twelve &quot;shattered myths&quot; they go on to counter throughout the book:<br />      1.  It takes a great idea to start a great company<BR>   2.  Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders<BR>   3.  Visionary companies share a common subset of &quot;correct&quot; core values<BR>   4.  Highly successful companies make their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning<BR>   5.  The most successful companies focus primarily on beating the competition<br />      As a current business student with a summer internship in a &quot;visionary company,&quot; I was amazed as their careful analysis rang true.  This is one book I can highly recommend to any student, professional, or business educator looking for those not-so-subtle traits that characterize a truly visionary company.<br />
0399142851|4.0|After a disappointing showing with Hornet's Nest, hurrah to PatCornwell for a return to Kay Scarpetta.  Not only does she decide tostick with the tried and true, but the development of Dr. Scarpetta as a woman with a real life (complete with love and loss) gives her readers something more to anticipate.  I just can't wait to know what happens to Lucy's career.

0380002930|5.0|I know that this is the latest in a long list of glowing reviews for this fabulous book, so I'll make this short.  This book has it all.

0553577123|4.0|I have just finished reading both versions of The Diary of A Young Girl by Anne Frank, the first edition, which was heavily edited by her father and the Definitive Edition which returns many of the passages he left out.<br /><br /> Since we are rating the Definitive Edition specifically, I rate it 8.  The first edition of this book as 9.  These rating are based on the translations of the original German text.  A 10 not possible.  Translations of any language not native to the writer are always subject to the translator's views and translation abilities.<br /><br /> Unless one reads the original manuscript in German and can understand the German of the time the diary was written they therefore must rely on the translator to convey the story adequately.<br /><br /> Much of the Definitive Edition was loaded with contemporary idioms which may or may not be accurate in translation.  And while the Definitive Edition does bring to light information about their situation which was not<br /> in the first, I found it tedious to read some passages over and over again.  All diaries have repetition since people are repetitious but the original editing helped to keep some of that to a minimum.<br /><br /> I am not sure why Otto Frank felt compelled to suppress some of the statisical information that Anne reported, though I can understand the<br /> suppression of some of the sexually explicit comments Anne makes, given the time the first edition was published (in the late fifties).  The only thing I can think of is that the first edition may have been slanted to an age<br /> group of readers similar in age to Anne Frank when she wrote the diary.<br /><br /> Even the vocabulary of the Definitive Edition is quite a bit higher educationally than I would suspect Anne Frank of having used.<br /><br /> Reading the Definitive Edition only served to confuse the reader as to what was in her original diary and what was her later modified version meant for publication by Anne herself and what the translator thought was the appropriate translation.<br /><br /> This book was supposed to be referencing a real historical document, Anne Frank's personal diary.

0684874350|5.0|Having spent much of my adult life coming to terms with my Irish Catholic Brooklyn childhood, I read Angela's Ashes with foreboding, relief, recognition, and admiration.  Before long, I was green with envy as I &quot;lived&quot; Frank's childhood with him.  <br />  Some readers who live their lives in denial of the cruelties they suffered as powerless wee folk have to run screaming from this memoir in sheer self-preservation.  But those of us who have dared to look the truth in the eye can do no less than EMBRACE this book, and surrender to the helpless spasms of sorrow-- and the JOY that such sorrow spawns . . . joy from sorrow--the true mystery of the universe.  <br />  Many readers and critics remarked with wonder and approval at what they perceived as Frank McCourt's &quot;forgiveness.&quot;  However, I do not see his honest, straightforward, witty, unaccusing accounting as forgiveness.  What I see in his narration is simply, PROFOUNDLY,  mysteriously:  LOVE.  These other readers perceive his failure to accuse and condemn as forgiveness.  I see it as the fact and the truth that his love for his faulty parents got the majority of his sweet, guileless, innocent votes.   Love is the microscope through which he recalls his childhood.  It is because of this stupendous love that one can witness the ANGUISH of such a childhood.  The anguish IS -- that the child LOVES the parents.  Not in spite of.  Not because of.  But   SIMPLY.   He loves them. <br />  I humbly claim kinship to his experience, his pathos, and his love for the parents.  Me hat is off to the talent that makes one JEALOUS that one's childhood was not QUITE as bad; and I need TWO heads to take me hat off again  --to the talent that made me absolutely REVERE the humble egg--the solitary egg that could be a Thanksgiving Day feast for four brothers!    Oops!   Make that THREE heads, for what a talent 'tis that makes one weep for the parents, the religion, the society that inflicts such pain and shame upon such gentle souls.  <br />One reviewer said that they kept expecting, hoping, for the Father to see the light and transform the lives of his family.  That critique made me realize that that was the key to the mystery of this boy's love, this man's abiding love:   we dream of 100% parental aptitude; in this man's early life we are tempted to accept, indeed to revel, in 50% parental effort.  But the amazing fact o' the matter is that this profound accounting of a life shows that a mere 10% could have made a monumental difference toward childhood happiness.  (I realize that this is off the point, but it is a philosophical observation that I could not resist.)  <br />While I am eternally indebted to Frank McCourt for my newly acquired reverence for the egg, as well as all the other material wonders of my adult life, I must, however reluctantly, reprimand him for omitting from his flawless report the tattered, crotchless underpants of my own Brooklyn, Irish, Catholic-school youth.  <br />Love ya, Frank.  If I were twenty years younger I'd let you have my children.  <br />Now, HOW do I entice others to read this marvelous memoir?   Maybe with the message that I enclosed when I sent me mither the book:   You'll cry.                    You'll laugh.                     You'll commit suicide
0886461251|5.0|This book is excellent.  I read it over ten years ago, but it stands out in my mind as one of the funniest books I've read, along with Slaughterhouse Five.  You will find yourself laughing out loud.  One of those books that everyone should read
0684874350|5.0|What a wonderful read! It all came flooding back as I read the reader comments, most of which mirror my thinking: How can anyone in America today complain about life's circumstances without reflecting how F. McCourt and family hoped to survive in the face of everything defeating. I want to offer this to everyone I know as a remarkable lesson in humanity; love for family and humor in face of it all make this compelling reading. I laughed as often as I cried. This will have lasting value for any and all who treasure a good story. Mary Schwind
0553277472|5.0|If I were to draw a timeline of philosophy with two markers, one marker would be the works of Plato and Aristotle, which placed Truth at the top of the heap (a proposition which forms the basis of western scientific thinking); the other marker would be Pirsig's work, which places Good at the top and Truth second.  Pirsig had an insight into the Quality Relationship.  Just as an eye cannot see itself, the Quality Relationship is very difficult to see because it is the means by which seeing (in the intellectual sense) takes place.  Even the purest scientific truth passes into the mind of its discoverer on a rail established by the Quality Relationship.  The implication is that all truth is personal and subjective, even widely accepted scientific truths.  That acceptance exists in the minds of many individuals, each of whom is motivated to receive the information and judge it against scientific criteria.  The motivation rests on the Quality Relationship, and that is strictly a personal value judgement of whatever the mind choses to examine.  Since individuals possess the Quality Relationship, this philosophy places individuals above science (modern society seems to need some of that view).  Pirsig's second work, Lila, examines what it means for larger social entities such as governments to possess their own Quality Relationships.  The book is also the exquisitely told personal story of Pirsig's efforts to recover this insight after losing the memory of it to shock treatment.  A beautiful book in all respects
0399142851|5.0|As always Ms. Cornwell blends old and new characterstogether. I love the way the reader gets to see how some charctersgrow and some stay the same. Ms. Cornwell shows that Dr.Scarpetta has humanity for others by worrying about co-workers and near strangers.,This adds a special quality to this book and to all the Kay Scarpetta books.
0061092037|3.0|This is a book meant only for first time Archer readers.  If you've never so much as take a glance  at a story by this master of storytellers, then go ahead take the plunge.  You'll definitely find this an immensely witty and exciting tale of two highly ambitious men fighting for fame and fortune.  As for all the Jeffrey Archer fans, who is like myself, out there you will sadly be disappointed as this is merely like a merging of two great novels that spellbound all of us, &quot;Kane And Abel&quot; and &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;.  Sigh...He has certainly let us down this time
1573225517|5.0|This book caused great consternation in our beach house last weekend! I kept interrupting perfectly normal conversations to &quot;let me read you just one part&quot; and by the end of the weekend I practically had to tether the book to my arm -- the house had turned into an army of bookstealers. The part about &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; is particularly both hilarious and witty (not the same thing) and had my compadres in hysterics. A wonderful, thoughtful, interesting and sympathetic look at the gap between the Baby Boomers and Gen-X, and the loves, jobs, families and crises that make it all worth living -- and definately worth reading about. I'm about to order ten copies from Amazon so that I can eventually get my own back. I want it to be part of my permanent collection, not on permanent loan!
0399142851|2.0|Redundant in many technical explanations-and not so technical.Pat, do you really have to explain what every acronym means?  I pitythe person who doesn't understand that AOL refers to America Online. Give readers a little more credit than that!
0393039765|5.0|This is truly one of the most thought-provoking books I have read in years.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who likes modern fiction.  The prose is clean and exciting and the setting and plot are extraordinary.  Although it is not the kind of book that might seem to appeal to women, I loved it
0679445099|4.0|Was good but I missed Marino in this book.  He didn't have much of a storyline and he is the one that gives humor to the Scarpetta stories
6301967984|3.0|I consider myself a fairly open-minded individual   but this film tests me. Pasolini shocks the viewer  with a twisted fictional interpretation of de Sade's &quot;The 120 Day's of Sodom&quot;. Libertine's will find delight in the acts of sadism committed within the castle deep inside the Black Forest. The town of Salo could never recover from this one. How Pasolini managed to keep the film &quot;artistic&quot; with such bad taste has to be seen to be believed. There is a lot of philosophical monologue and dialogue between the intense (very intense) visual scenes of the most disgusting acts imaginable. No Hollywood ending  for this flick.  END
0671004107|5.0|Real Carl Sagan fans will already own the book.  So what am I doing at Amazon?  Well I think the book is at my parents house; and I want to reread it. I was raised on Carl Sagan and to see the 'Contact' movie was to bring me back to what I used to be.  The movie will disappoint those seeking the latest special effect-ed aliens; but it will move those who as children dreamt of answering the big questions and/or traveling to the stars.  Was I the only one who asked himself, &quot;If I could travel to a distant civilization at the speed of light never to return or to return to a charred, aged earth, would I go?&quot; and naively but seriously answer, &quot;yes&quot;?  While one's ambition may still secretly long to represent one's planet, maturity (call it spiritual or moral maturity) includes an understanding that we aren't alone in the universe (even lacking aliens and lacking God) if we can share and communicate with other sentients, and these are the ones we love
0425152251|5.0|Sophie's World is an imperative text for any philosophystudent.  The fast-paced action, which combines everything from basicGreek Philosophy to Descartian skepticism, to Hume, with the lives of two teenaged girls, makes this novel a thoroughly enjoyable read. Gaarder's clever wit and irony serve as the basis upon which this ingenious story is constructed.  His insights on religion and human nature are intertwined masterfully with an intelligent yet entertaining story line. A definite 10**********. --Kimi Marie Shibata
155800145X|5.0|I'd been up twenty four hours traveling from Belgium, through Germany to Denmark to visit some friends.  We were riding in a brand new, beautiful Danish coach and I was in the company of three, very proper looking, older Danish ladies.  Along with my body, my mind was tired and when my mind gets tired it amplifies things.  Bad gets worse, funny gets rib cracking, if you know what I mean?  I was on the part about Miss Trixie.  I could not contain myself.  I would read one sentence and burst into hideous laughter.  Then I would calm myself and read another and the same thing would happen.  I would go back and read the same sentence and just crack up.  I couldn't stand it.  I was making a complete fool out of myself and had lost control.  I could not stop reading and I could not stop laughing.  When I looked at the ladies I thought they might be plotting to send for someone to bring a sizable bag with a few rocks in it to take care of this &quot;offensive&quot; Yankee.  At this time I decided to extract my hideous self to the hallway and read out there.   I thought I was getting strange looks in the compartment, but here, in the hallway, I knew it wouldn't be long before someone showed up with some manacles and the bag.  I was forced to retreat to the compartment and the proper Danish ladies.  I started reading again.  The laughter followed.  Burst after burst of demented hyena laughter.  I have a laugh that has been labled contagious and the next thing, I'm hearing little chuckles from the proper Danish ladies.  I look at them and start laughing.  They look at me and burst into laughter and then all break out cigars and start smoking.  Cool.  This is the funniest book I have ever read, all three times, and I'm ready for it again.  My step father, who is rather proper and hates the disgusting commercial TV violence and rotten launguage picked it up and started in the middle.  I raised an eybrow and watched.  He turned to the front, read the Forward, and never stopped.He read it in a day and a half.  This is a book that I pick up in used book stores to give to people I meet who like to read good stuff and have open and uncluttered minds, slightly sick.  Try it, it's a kick right in the funny bones.  SPARK       spark@insert.com PS  It would make a wonderful movie if the characters were picked properly.

Marino a huge fan of Elvis -- ya gotta love it!And I had no clue who the murderer was until the very end, of course I suspected someone -- was dead wrong, of course!  The interaction between Lucy and her Aunt Kay is always so well done, her feelings for Lucy come from Scarpetta so easily -- Cornwell's gotta have a niece like Lucy, doncha think?  Buy it I say, and make sure to sign your name on the front fly cuz you'll be asked to lend it out.
0345350499|5.0|This is my summertime reading book - every year for the past 8 years on the summer solstice I pick this book up and dive back into the fantasy/real world of Athurian history.  I love the fact that this book is told mostly from the pagan woman's  perspective and I learn something new each time about the growth of Christianity and the &quot;driving of the serpents&quot; from all of Britain as well as historical items like festivals, games, and the like.  I have recommended this book to many men and woman friends and all have come back with a positive experience. I think this book shines above all of Bradley's others and I look forward to nest summer solstice to live through the book once again

0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt has succeeded in keeping me interested in non-fiction, no small task.  This book reads like a novel, but provides the heartbreaking knowledge that THIS IS REAL.  How could he even have grown up with all the evil times he had to endure? And he tells his story with such grace and good humor, too.  I told my daughter that I wish I hadn't read it already, so I'd have the experience of reading it anew
0671004107|5.0|With so many science fiction books and movies screaming of vicious, drooling aliens and invasions it is a relief to know that some writers, such as the late Carl Sagan, are making intelligent comments about our relationship with the universe.  The movie is excellent, but the book is even better. With a very different and more elaborative plot it is able to explore not only outer space but real human virtues
0345389409|1.0|I agree with almost all the negative comments already posted about this book. I have no idea why it was so well reviewed in the Kirkus review noted above. This book has nothing to do with vampires. It is boring (I skimmed the last quarter of it). The character of Lestat is, as has already been mentioned, almost unrecognizeable. Here is what I would recommend you do Anne: Write a story that features Louis again (I am sick of Lestat -- anyway you've turned him into the worst aspects of Louis -- the whining). The other possibility is to write more about David and the Talamasca. This would have been a logical next book after Body Thief. David is a fascinating character and I was dying to know how he was doing as a vampire. Is he longing to share what he knows with Talamasca? Why not tie this vampire link with the witches? I mean we learned in the last witch book that the Talamasca is in trouble. I want to know more about them! And David is just the person to find out the information. Doesn't David deserve his own book? Maybe he could be enlisted to help with all the trouble the Talamasca is going through with the witches back in New Orleans?  But please let Dora and Roger die a peaceful death. I hated them both, and it sounds like the rest of your readers did too.
0671004611|5.0|There are two credible eye witnesses to Roswell living today: Dr Jesse Marcel Jr, and now Col. Philip Corso.  Debunkers say Dr Marcel was too young at age 10 to know what he handled when his father brought home wreckage from the Roswell crash site in July, 1947.  And now the debunkers say Corso is too old at age 81 to remember correctly anything that went on while he was in the Pentagon in the 1960's. <br />  The debunkers are really going to have to work hard to destroy Corso's tale.  He was in the thick of the government cover up while working under General Arthur Trudeau in the Army's Research and Development dept of the Pentagon in the early 1960's.  His credentials as a 21 year career army intelligence officer are impeccable. By leaking Roswell technology found in the wreckage to industry under the guise that the material was obtained from various foreign government technology, the perfect government cover up was in place.  From 1948 onward, industry made great leaps of progress in areas such as lasers, night vision devices, fiber optics, and integrated circuits. <br />  Corso's hard to swallow claim that Reagan and Gorbachev mutually agreed that SDI should be built to protect our planet from attack by the EBE's (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities), becomes easier to digest if one accepts the premise that the EBE's are indeed here and up to no good when it comes to helping we humans. All abduction stories with associated genetic experimentation, and ongoing cattle mutilations also involving the removal of sexual organs, point to those conclusions.  <br />   By naming specific projects and names of people involved in the cover up, Corso is the first person truly within the system to write a first hand (five fingered, not six) account of the Roswell cover up.  I applaud his courage, and hope he follows this book with another one containing specific names, files, and events. An index is sorely lacking, and more exhibits would have added to the book's credibility.      Corso does engage in too much bravado by suggesting his and Trudeau's efforts were solely responsible for the end of the Cold War.  Corso even claims he was the one to force the public disclosure of Soviet missiles on ships bound for Cuba by leaking the classified information to Senator Keating of NY.  Those parts of the book detract from the main message of the Roswell cover up, and should have been excluded. <br />   I'll forgive him the above because the real value here is that the story of our government's cover up of Roswell and its denials of the existence of UFO's is finally seeing the light of day.

An easy read, this book  will be of value to large and small business   alike.<br />      Learn how some of America's largest corporations   have made multi-$million mistakes in a game   that is subtle and sublime. This book informs   the reader of how to go around the competition instead of against them. Very entertaining as well.<br />      I am a TV Account Executive and I give away   free copies to potential clients. I recommend   this book to anyone interested in marketing, novice or not.
0385472951|4.0|This was a page turner. I don't read very many books written by men. The ending to this book was very disapointing. You could tell it was written by a man - no romance
0399142851|4.0|Was going to rate this book a \\"6\\" because of the ending beingsprung at me. But from other reviews I see I was the one who missedCornwell's clues.  It still seems to me like UNNATURAL EXPOSURE ends VERY suddenly.  But getting there is all the fun, and I enjoyed her writing and the unusual adventures in this book very much.  Patricia Cornwell has a unique style which has made me a big fan, and this book is in that customary, involving style.  I do not like to see her books end at all, ESPECIALLY not suddenly.
0812034465|5.0|&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is a book that one can read many times over a lifetime because it is a story that appeals to any age group and on many emotional and intellectual levels.  Ms.Lee's style is comforting and conversational in it's tone.  There is no better book for young adults or readers of any age who wish to be transported, through the innocent eyes of a child, back to a time that, in the final analysis, is not vastly different from the present.  The lessons taught here, about humanity, tolerance and love, are ageless
B000002UAO|5.0|It would have been easy for the Beatles to keep writing songs like &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;.  As great as those early songs were, they were not exactly original.  Pop singers had been singing about girls and dating, and all sorts of other &quot;teen-ager&quot; issues for years before the Beatles came along.  But the Beatles influences were changing by the end of 1965. Bob Dylan had replaced Elvis as their idol, and Dylan's influence would show through in the fabulous &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  Oh, the songs still dealt primarily with girls and relationships, but the sound had chnaged and the issues were changing as well.  Some of Lennon's songs in particular deal with the darker side of love.  &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, and &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; as well as the McCartney jammer &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are far different both in music and lyric than some of the early songs.  Love is no longer as simple as &quot;...just holding hands.&quot;  &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a big step forward for the Fab Four, and thus, one of their finest records. END

B000002UAR|5.0|In 1966, Beatlemania was still raging.  The boys were touring practically non-stop and life at the top was beginning to wear on them.  On stage, they were still the cute mop-tops in their crisp suits (although their hair was considerably longer by this point).  They were still singing their old songs like &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;.  But in the studio, it was an entirely different story.  For their next LP, &quot;Revolver&quot;, the boys had begun a new era. The poppy love songs from the early days were disappearing fast.  These songs were far more sofisticated, some bordering on psychedelic.  Lennon's &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; describes an acid trip, and &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; gives the imagery of more drug use.  &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; is a secret referrence to an American doctor who perscribes illegal drugs.  As usuall, McCartney's songs are more mainstream.  Ballads such as &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, and &quot;For No One&quot; stand out, as well as more upbeat McCartney numbers like &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; keeping parents blissfuly ignorant of the pot-smoking Beatles.  But the Beatles touring days were ending, and so was the need to keep up the &quot;cute&quot; public image.  &quot;Revolver&quot; would usher in this new era for the Beatles, and in the process, provide us with some legendary music.

0679735909|5.0|At the time, I was a Senior at Boston University taking 2 literature classes, totalling 14 novels to be read in 4 months. I didn't need another book to read, but I picked up Possession at a used bookstore. From the very beginning, I was entranced.  The mystery of what Roland found in the vault at the Bristish Museum and what it would unfold intrigued me...the ghosts had come alive. The web so intricately spun between the characters served as a trap; I was caught in the lives of the poets and the academics, their loves and searchings.  But moreso than a trap, Possession was a refuge.     The voices of Byatt are myriad and incredibly believable.  She is a centuries-old male poet, a writer of fairy poems and stories, a literary telescope into the British countryside, a frustrated Post-Doc, and a woman professor that has never quite been understood.      Possession is an amazing literary experience, full of love and mystery.  It is a TREASURE.
0684833395|5.0|The phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; is mostly used by supposedly literate people to convey the notion of circular reasoning. e.g., Yossarian couldn't get out of the war unless he was crazy, but - if he wanted out - he couldn't be crazy.  That's one interpretation.  As I see it, that wasn't really Heller's point.  The real meaning of the phrase, as quoted from the book&quot; was &quot;Catch-22...  Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot;    Great book.
0385311400|5.0|I realized I never commented on the book once I received it and read it.  It was FANTASTIC!  Like the rest in the series, I couldn't put it down.  The characters are so life-like and when I'm reading I feel as though I'm right there ... the fly on the wall so to speak.  I dread the periods between books because nothing seems to measure up.  I do have a tip on a similar read and I'll give it a shot.  Bless you Diana for your imagination, may it continue to flourish!  (My second son was born March 17th ... St. Patrick's Day!
0679460063|4.0|Cornwell has returned Scarpetta to a more believable role than in her last adventure - that of a &quot;wonder woman.&quot;   Cornwell uses the usual twisted serial murder as a launching pad to enter the mental terror of killer viruses she would not be ordinarily able to enter with a medical examiner.  She again spends abundant time continuing charater development, yet she uses it also to retain the tension of trying to find the killer before there is another body found.  The ending is sudden and abrupt.  I felt she had perhaps reached her page limit and decided to quit.  I did find the book to be a page turner.  Far, far better than the last one

0679745203|5.0|I read The English Patient years before it was made into a movie, and i was stunned and recommended it to everyone; it is one of the most rewarding and beautiful books you'll ever read; to many it seems challenging at first to focus and understand what's going on--but it's absolutely worth it and it's VERY different from the movie (which did the best thing possible by not trying to imitate the style of the book)! This might be expected from an author who is a poet, who alludes rather than literaly describing. Ondatjee writes his characters in an often elliptical and detached way, but at the same time his writing is viscerally lyrical and piercingly evocative of a place and time of war and post-war devastation. Kip is perhaps the warmest and in some ways most fully fleshed (and my favorite) character, and through his voice Ondaatjee probes the issues of race, class, political and national allegiance in a very moving way without giving us any easy answers, or any answers really at all.  (Kip and all his important scenes and issues were completely left out of both the movie and many were missing from the abridged cassette version) For those who liked The English Patient, try John Berger's to The Wedding.
0345404475|5.0|While I have seen both the Movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and read this book, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; I have a diffrent place in my heart for both.  The book takes you to the future where you see a landscape torn apart by a brutal nuclear war and shows that religon is the only way out for the dwindling population.  This book contains one of the most dignifing reasons not to create androids that look like us. This book says to people, why should we have androids that look like us and talk like us, but can't feel like us. When we can't even feel for other human beings that happen to be a little bit diffrent from the rest of us.  This portrays Rick Deckard as a little bit more human than the movie version.  Plus it shows the need for animals in our future.  While the deletion of some parts on Ridley Scott's part from the movie, it still takes nothing away from both the book or the movie.  If you've seen &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and haven't read the book, you've only scratched the surface.  If you've read the book &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; and not seen the movie, you could always dig a little deeper.  And For more interesting plot twists read the next book, &quot;Blade Runner 2: The edge of human&quot;

0380778556|5.0|Often marketed for teenaged girls, Rebecca is actually the last of the great novels in the Gothic tradition.  The first of the great Gothic bestsellers, Jane Eyre, serves as template and inspiration for Du Maurier's haunting story of the triumphant power of evil.  There is the ancient, enormous manor house, Manderly (Thornfield), the romantic, father-lover Byronic hero, Max DeWinter (Edward Rochester), the frightening servant with a BIG secret, Mrs. Danvers (Grace Poole), a lonely, orphaned heroine who sees herself as clumsy and homely, rather than innocent and lovely, the Narrator (Jane Eyre),  the bildungsroman of the heroine growing into wisdom and loss of innocence, the great house as symbol of corruption hidden by surface beauty, the colossal and hidden past mistake made by the Hero, devastating fires, and love so passionate and enduring it overcomes unthinkable misfortune.  Du Maurier was haunted by Bronte, it's clear, just as her unnamed character is haunted by Rebecca.  Rebecca, whose name is everywhere, and the Narrator, whose name is nowhere in the novel.  The skill to make such an odd twist of nomenclature is only one that Du Maurier practices in the tale of secrets, horror, love, and redemption.  Or is it redemption?  She leaves the question open just enough to bring you back to reading Rebecca time and time again, just as the name of Rebecca's sailboat, &quot;Je reviens,&quot; predicted.  (Je reviens:  &quot;I come back&quot;)

0385472951|5.0|In this book, John Grisham makes it back to the days of old,when he wrote \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Firm\\".\\"The Partner\\" kept my eyes seeking out each page with zeal. Grisham captures much of the inner law firm communications, or lack thereof, and his description of money transfers and electronic wiring, show the reader that this happens every minute that the markets are open.  This book will make each and every partner take notice and make sure that they have instilled appropriate procedures when it comes to money transfers and the people in the firm with the authority or the \\"knowledge\\" to do so.  As a future lawyer, (December 1997), I highly recommend that each and every attorney (to-be) read this book.

0385121679|4.0|THE SHINING, the fifth bestselling horror novel by Stephen King, is ultimately   a novel which, in its final moments, manages to transcend  its strange prose mixture of pulp magazine-type chills and Lovecraftian horror   imagery to deal with deeper concepts, such as the enduring legacy of evil and    parental love. Set during a cold, icy winter in a Colorado Hotel, King constantly   switches his point of view between various narrators- the caretaker, a failed writer   named Jack Torrance who is combating alcoholism, his wife, Wendy, and their    young son, Danny, who has a peculiar supernatural ability to see visions of terror.<BR>   The hotel, The Overlook, is haunted by various ghosts- the spirits of the suicides,   the murdered, those who died in strange ways, and, as the winter goes on, these ghosts   begin to drive Jack Torrance insane, finally leading him to wage a terrifying game of   cat-and-mouse with the others in the hotel.<BR> And only his son, Danny, who can see the cause   of the carnage in the visions he recieves, can put an end to his father's rampage.<br />   Unfortunately, King takes too long to set up his exposition, and when the shocks finally come,   they burst too rapidly together to allow the reader to fully absorb the impact of what   exactly is happening. A good book in concept, but the pacing, as described above,   is slightly flawed. Another masterwork from a genious in his field.

0679457313|4.0|A Beautiful story told in the old-fashion way: a tale with a beginning and an end.  Many have described it to be like a kaleidoscope and caricature, and I add to say that it is like a Norman Rockwell painting filled with activity and characters, or like ``Where's Wally'' which children never tire of exploring.<br />    As such the visual quality cannot be flawed no matter how her staccato prose interspersed with unnecessary capitalisation, and intentional misspelling of words are critised.  It is poetic license where accuracy is not questioned.  The end result is an honest book not meant as highbrow read, but entertaining to say the least.<br />      The author is an unashamed consummate dramatist.  Melodrama is sprinkled liberally like spice all over.  If it were a multimedia publication it would have song and dance like Indian movies.  So dramatic that she seems like a pervert but without the graphics.  The book is full of sensualness that would leave a reader satiated like after a good meal with good company.<br />      Nowhere else has another contemporary author has been so adventurous in the play of words and images.<br />
0385472951|4.0|As usual, Grisham's book was suspenseful and interesting.  Thelegalities were covered niceley and all the subplots ended neatly.However, I felt that the ending was completely unjustified.  The twist seemed completely implausible based on the Grisham's narrative throughout the novel.  While a plot twist can be surprising, it must be supported.  This one was completely unbelievable.
0679736646|5.0|Yeah sure, Ubik concerns itself with &quot;advertising&quot; and &quot;paranormal psychics&quot;--the conventional montage of sci-fi cliches-- but Dick's message always lies somewhere beyond his comedic portrayal of such elements.    HINT: In an interview conducted for the now defunct (I think) &quot;Philip K. Dick Newsletter&quot; the author notes his interest in an observation that people ordered to perform strange behaviors under hypnosis, construct, out of nothing, &quot;rational&quot; justifications post facto for their entirely irrational behavior.      Ubik is, above (or below) all else, an exersize in and an examination of ideology, and one of Dick's finest works.
0140187650|5.0|I am astonished by the comments Amazon.com includes under *Eichmann in Jerusalem*: to characterize Arendt's book as a &quot;defense&quot; of Eichmann is either a deliberate falsehood or a comment written by someone who has never read the book.  I assume the comment was written on the basis of Michael Musmanno's incompetent review of *Eichmann* for the *New York Times*.  Musmanno's review blatantly misrepresented Arendt's work, and I would expect Amazon.com to be able to do better.   Far from &quot;defending&quot; Eichmann, Arendt portrays him as a willing participant in mass murder, and, in her Epilogue, she strongly agrees with the death sentence that he received.  The myth of Arendt's &quot;defense&quot; of Eichmann is a result of her belief that Eichmann was motivated more by immersion in the totalitarian &quot;system&quot; of Nazi Germany than by hatred of Jews.  In no way does she excuse him or the Germans, and, indeed, she argues that complicity in the Holocaust was ubiquitous in Germany.  Her thesis is certainly open to debate, but to suggest that this brave and decent thinker sought for a moment to defend Eichmann or the Nazis is outrageous.  Her book remains one of the most thought-provoking studies of the perpetrators of the Holocaust ever written.
0679445099|4.0|I really could not wait to reward myself for a couple of very hard weeks work with this book.  The cover is Cornwell's usual visual and kinesthetic marketing strategy (excellent) and the book is extremely readable.  I read it at one sitting as I usually do for this writer.  But despite my thorough enjoyment of the book, it was not Patricia Cornwells best effort! Thank God, however, that Dr. Kay is finally crystallizing her rather tedious affairs of the heart.

You're a truly talented author, and some of your past books have been among the best I've ever read.  I find it hard to believe that Plum Island was  even written by you.  Are you just trying to use  your name now to cash in on the next big paycheck?  This book is even more commercial than a recent John Grisham.         There were points where I felt like I was watching  a grade B movie in slow motion.  I'm not saying that  this book isn't fun, but it certainly isn't worthy  of Nelson's name.
0671004107|5.0|I'm no literary critic, so I cannot give a good criticism on the structure of the book.  However, the book, at the very least, would be a gem for an aspiring wordsmith.  It is lovely to see the English language used so eloquently.  I sat for hours, with Contact in one hand and a good dictionary in the other.<br />For me, the Message is what's important: Making contact within by making contact without, theology relating to science and science resonating with theology, politics as the ever-present reminder of the egocentrics on all sides.  I hope this book moves my fellow readers as it moves me.<br />Contact is a great gift from a great man
0517122707|4.0|This tale of obese Ignatius Reilly, his mother, and his misadventures in New Orleans does not live up to its standard of being a hilarious book. The plot is good, but nothing spectacular: All the characters connected to Ignatius go about their unusual lives until a rather satisfying but predictable end that pretty much ties them all together.<br /> The clever dialog is what gives this book a lift. The extreme ends of the educated community are brought together, and their interactions work extremely well in keeping the story interesting. <br /> It is unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole is no longer with us, for this story shows tremendous potential

0887307280|5.0|Michael Gerber has written an easy to digest yet powerfully constructed book that opened my eyes to a number of new ideas and ways of thinking about a small business.  Basically, he believes that franchising your business, whatever it is, is the road to success.<br />He discusses the differences between the Technician, the Manager, and the Visionary in all of us, and shows how ignoring one or two can spell disaster for your company.<br />He carries on an (I believe) imaginary conversation with a woman running a pie shop to get his points across, and although he occasionally goes over the top in making said points, he uncovers a lot of fresh ideas along the way.<br />If you are considering starting a new business, or wondering why yours is struggling, this book will do nothing but help your cause.

1568491581|4.0|This book describes the four pillars of spiritual  growth:  discipline, love, religion, and grace.  The author points out that love is not the same   thing as what most people consider &quot;love.&quot;  Rather, it is an act of the will to intelligently enhance someone else's spiritual growth.      <br />      Either M. Scott Peck is extremely good or extremely evil.  Another book that he wrote,   People of the Lie, is the most powerful book   that I have ever read.  And he labels ordinary   people such as you and me to be &quot;evil,&quot; maybe   even more evil than a serial killer.  Does he do   this because we are truly evil and are in dire need of spiritual direction, or out of spite?  We don't know.   <br />   Similarly, his book The Road Less Traveled does not give specific instructions, but merely creates a hunger for spiritual growth.  He tells us what love is NOT, yet he doesn't tell us specifically enough what love IS.  And he strongly supports Christianity, but yet has revulsion towards traditional Christianity.  His attitude towards the mentally ill also is different than mine.  Is this good or bad?  I don't know.   <br />   Read the book and see for yourself.
0312932081|4.0|Perhaps we need to create a new genre for &quot;Ender's Game.&quot; Set against the standard sci-fi backdrop (star battles, the fight to save humanity from an alien society), &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is actually &quot;leadership fiction.&quot; Anyone who has studied leadership theory knows the debates: What is a good leader? What is a bad leader? Are the traits of good and bad leadership situational? Are good leaders born or developed? Scott tackles these tough questions in an amazingly entertaining and engrossing story. Through his training, Ender Wiggin encounters at least one representative from each of the Myers-Briggs types and Card explores the positives and negatives of each personality. In the end, each of these characters helps to create the Ender Wiggin we see in the final chapters. But is that character a hero or villain? Card leaves it up to the reader (and the sequels) to decide

The fact that Anne was real, that she actually walked on this earth was simply enough to touch me.  Anne was so normal, so simple, she was just so real.  Her experience of having been occuppied by the Nazis shaped her character so much and made her so much more womanly than she had ever been.

After the pathetic &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; and some pretty lame Scarpetta novels, this book is a pleasant return to the forensic heroine. And it was refreshing not to have to listen to the painfully bad Marino dialogue. The storyline is much more focused than previous novels. The ending was abrupt, especially the acceptance of Mark's death. But, all in all, it was pretty good
0679429247|1.0|Without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. If you are looking for an ending, don't waste your time. Here's the story in a nut-shell: Nothing happens
068483605X|5.0|Although I was first forced to read this book in Grade 7 English, it quickly grew on me as I read on. Although it is a book about rabbits, it's actualy much more deep than that. On the outside it comes across as a hefty children's book (rings in at about 300 pages)... Well you know the saying you can't judge a book by it's cover
0060920432|5.0|This is an extraordinary book.  The author's writing style is unusually concise and he is able to explain complex ideas in a simple and understandable style.  The concept of flow is intuitively very appealing.  The author conducted an apparently well structured empirical study of the causes and conditions that resulted in &quot;optimal experience&quot; (ie happiness) and reached some insightful and convincing conclusions.  The ability to achieve &quot;optimal experience&quot; is tightly linked to the ability to focus on fulfilling personally determined goals.  Although the book is useful as a personal blueprint for achieving &quot;optimal experience&quot; I found more facinating his compelling arguments about the functioning of the human mind and spirit
0684874350|5.0|McCourt's sly Irish wit and his indomitable optimism in the face of heart-wrenching poverty and neglect make this an unforgettable book.  While some members of our book group were overwhelmed by the sadness of McCourt's miserable childhood, we all laughed aloud at some of the comic moments:  most memorably his frustrating search for meaning in &quot;The Lives of the Saints&quot;.<br />What we felt to be most special about the book is the beauty of McCourt's writing:  the childlike clarity, simplicity, and innocence of his viewpoint; his dry sense of humor;  and, above all, the unmistakable Irish lilt in his words. Makes the reader laugh and cry simultaneously.
0553565915|5.0|This book evokes two reactions. One, hope and belief in the after-life. The second, disbelief.<br /><br />The reader goes through various emotions as one goes through this book. Joy, peace, calm, disbelief, etc.<br /><br />I've read this book twice and each time it appeals to different facets of your life, depending on what kind of situations you are going through<br /><br /> All in all a great book to read to get a proper perspective on our own mission in life and our role as parents (especially those with difficult kids!)
0385312083|5.0|As the Tralfamdorians, the omniscient space creatures who like to look at humans in cages, put it we never die, we live on forever in our moments. Certainly the Tralfamdorians were speaking of Slaughterhuse, which is made up  entirely of those moments. This masterpiece which satarizes just about every element of human life truly magnifies Vonnegut's power. However bleak and disparing the messages are, this book should be read by every creature earth and beyond
0783815484|4.0|A good book... but is it for children?  It is, if your child won't understand the reference to suicide.  But would you risk that?  What is suicide doing in a children's book?  Of course,  Defoe's Robinson Carouso contains references to  cannibalism, The Giver contains infanticide, etc.  So consider this before selecting it for your  child.  Otherwise, it's on a philosophical par  with The Prophet... but will children be able to  understand it?
0385486804|5.0|A fine, although depressing, book about a very idealistic young man who ventures up to live in the wilds of Alaska, without any companions, food, equipment. A good scenario of the old &quot;man vs. nature&quot; theme
0553103547|5.0|George R. R. Martin has succeeded where few authors have. This isn't a quest for a sword or a singing harp. We've all read about a bazillion of those. This book will surprise you. I don't want to give anything away. If you love epic fantasy or want to dive in to a new genre, read A Game of Thrones
0870119435|5.0|It's a feeling most difficult to capture in words.  It seems realistic, but as much as we would like to dream, life just doesn't happen this way.  It's a series of exciting mundane highlights following one after another non-stop.  The storyline carries through by coming to terms with loss of a sanctual centerpiece of the self.  The protagonist  ultimately identifies and falls in love with the driving force behind the unmasked concept of &quot;love&quot; during a very troubled era in Japan.
0399142851|2.0|Okay, okay, okay. I know there are legions of Cornwell supporters who firmly believe that the Richmond writer is the next Agatha Christie. And as a &quot;johnny-come-lately&quot; to the Scarpetta phenom, maybe I was expecting too much from Ms. Cornwell and her doctor/lawyer/super-sleuth. However, having read all of the existing Scarpetta novels over the last year and a half, I can only believe that the author's attention to medical, legal and technological detail is very much getting in the way of her attention to plot, character and pacing.    In this latest venture, Kay is once again contemplating her feelings towards Bentley (she does this every hundred pages or so, whenever she has a moment of free time). Once again, a dangerous psychopath has targeted Richmond (!) for a sick and twisted plot to see revenge for a past injustice --one which is hastily explained in the last ten pages of the novel. Once again, Kay Scarpetta has become the focus of the fiend's attention. (Doesn't this happen in every town? The M.E. is ALWAYS the focus of nutjobs, psychos and bully-cops, not to mention the local press!)    Instead of a fast-paced whodunit filled with fresh, interesting characters, we get the same old Scarpetta who spends WAY too much time telling the reader how busy and tired she is. Sister, we'll all busy and tired. Stop whining and chase the badguys.     No arguement that Cornwell researchs her books beautifully. Her descriptions of Richmond and the Richmond area are accurate and make me remember fondly the time I spent there a few years ago. And she knows her stuff when it comes to the material: If and when I want to grow a mutant strain of smallpox, I know just where to go.      But a good book makes you care about the characters in the book you're reading, not about what they'll be doing in the next sequel. My suggestion is to shake things up, Patricia. Make us care about Kay and Marino and Lucy again. And please let Scarpetta go on vacation!!
1563523302|5.0|The information in this book is invaluable to younger people. It is too late for us, who are in our 60's, but I am sending it to my 26-year-old son in the hopes that he will profit by its information and find himself in the new generation of &quot;millionaires&quot; by the time he is our age. Valuable information conveyed in a readable format
0385486804|5.0|Read this fascinating book in 2 sittings..
0440213525|4.0|A D.A. out for a conviction. A Lawyer out of her League. A Young boy who knew to much.  I like how Grisham gets this book running right   from the start. Ricky realizes older brother Mark   has cigarettes, Ricky wants a smoke, they go smoke   in the woods. Then the book starts. The 11 and 8   year old kids see a Black Cadillac come up, then an   attempted suicide. Mark tries to stop it.   eventually he gets caught, learns too much, and is   hunted By Barry &quot;Blade&quot; Muldanno and the mofia,   and must answer to the FBI.   Sometimes the book is slow, some times it is a   thrilling page-turner. A great ending.
0385472951|4.0|It's become a fashionable thing to read everything John Grisham puts out; and in that line; the story is not bad.  But for a person who has never read Grisham; disappointment with this novel may set in.  If we could have had more story; life on the run, how the law firm was swindled, etc., the read would have been a great ride.  But for tried and true Grisham fans, the story ranks right up there with &quot;The Client&quot; and &quot;The Firm.&quot;  This book was not as memorable as &quot;A Time To Kill,&quot; but still thoroughly enjoyable
0062502182|3.0|I found this book through the reviews of the Celestine Prophesy, A couple of people recommended this book as a much better alternative.  I have read both books, and I can say without a doubt that I enjoyed CP much more.  The Alchemist is a children's book.  A simple little story, with VERY little content which could require thought.  I would recommend it to any 3'rd grader, but if you are much older, skip it
0553328255|5.0|I've always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes ever since I read The Hound of the Baskervilles as a child, so this book is a real godsend.  Being able to read story after story so easily, you become immersed in a world of dimly lit gas lamps, shadowy motives and events, and the quest for understanding.   <br /> Conan Doyle's strength is perhaps in his participation in the Victorian (and Modern) desire for answers in the face of increasing doubt and confusion.  He shows that answers to mysteries are never quite solvable by reason and rationality.  Rather, the key to solving a mystery is by inevitably stumbling upon the solution, and then making it look as if one arrived at it through orderly reasoning. <br /> All and all, this collection should be read again and again and again.  And that's elementary
067031255X|5.0|This is an old book; the figures often wear outmoded hairstyles, the female nudes often are decked out in t-strap heels (who knows why?).  Forget that, you won't care.  This is arguably the best all-encompassing handbook on how to draw people ever!! It covers scale of figures, perspective, the figure in almost any position, anatomy, children, separate sections on hands and faces, and even the effects of clothing on the figure.  Written with a practical but light hand and occasional humour, there is simply nothing like this book.  If you could only have one book on how to draw ANYTHING, never mind the human figure, this would be the book to buy
0140042393|5.0|No one since Steinbeck has so craftily woven the names of places and things into the fabric of the characters'  lives.  It is a complete joy to read the melange of roadside towns and attractions that seem to haunt the Joads' journey.  Their jalopy becomes a metaphor of a broken down world that entraps them.  However catastrophic the tragedy becomes,  it is a slow and deliberate kind of grief.  There always seems to be someone to help send the Joads' on their way.  The tale hits home when the Oklahoma family reaches California, the land of hopes and dreams, of liberty, for the Joads' and the rest of the nation.  There awaits them a cauldron of discontent among those sharing a similar fate, in the migrant worker camps.  Of course, like all Steinbeck works, the novel ends on a dark, albeit sardonic note that is brilliant and one that only he could have produced. This book was a benchmark for what has become the great American road tale
0345389409|1.0|I'm seeing a severe decline in the quality of Rice's novels.  In the past, I would jump at one of her books on the bookstore shelf, now, I wait for it at the library and skim through it before I borrow!  If you thought &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot; was bad, read this one
0671004107|5.0|I could tell you why I liked this book, but I think you really need to read it yourself to appreciate it. If you haven't seen the movie yet ---read the book first---!!! The book is a million million times better. A 'must-read' even for those who don't like Sci-Fi
0385311400|5.0|I read this series from page 1 of Outlander to the last page of Drums of Autumn.  The series is excellent.  It includes romance, adventure, and historical fiction.  Have you ever considered a similar work for children?  Teachers are always looking for good books to use in the classroom.  Keep up the great work.  I can't wait for number 5!!
0345349571|4.0|This is a scholarly yet highly entertaining account of this period. At times this book was so compelling that I could hardly put it down. Although it is a history, in many ways it reads as a thriller. I highly recommend to anyone in search of academic information and entertainment
0679745203|5.0|Before beginning the text of _The English Patient_, I read the acknowledgements Michael Ondaatje had compiled:  three pages printed in a miniscule font where he'd cited titles and authors of very specialized books on winds, bombs, desert studies by the Royal Geographical Society.  I realized this book would teach as well as entertain.  Ondaatje spent years researching this book before he linked all of the narrative images and ideas together; _The English Patient_ is a patchwork quilt of a story.  If you don't like books that shift back and forth between plot lines and various characters' points of view, you might not be thrilled by _The English Patient_, but the writing is so fine and lyrical, the characters, setting and plot so painstakingly and lovingly textured, that if you don't read this book, you're missing out on a meaningful sensory and literary experience.  &lt;PR&gt;     There is often a tendency to discount a novel's literary merit when it has been made into a film, and I've found that friends sometimes scoff at my suggestion to read this novel, but _The English Patient_ as a novel stands stoically on its own.  The book also explores various characters much more deeply than does the film.  The novel is Hana's story and because of this, there is also more of Kip's story.  Ondaatje swathes the Count Almasy-Katharine Clifton affair in mystery; it is more mythical than Kip and Hana's romance, and thus more likely to attract a filmmaker's interest; there's more room for embellishment, for conjecture.  &lt;PR&gt;     The landscapes of Italy and North Africa and the machinations of warring countries are given their fair share of the story as well.  Ondaatje manages to make the long chapter on Kip's British bomb-defusing training as lyrical as the love affairs.  _The English Patient_ is a book to be admired and envied, to be turned to again and again; each reading will seem like a discovery.
0671004611|1.0|I have an extremely open mind, but this book is ridiculous!  If it weren't for all the self-agrandizing stories Corso tells, it might ring truer; but as it stands, it seems phony
0345350499|5.0|This was one of the first Arthurian books I read. Every book after it that delt with King Arthur and Camolot, if something wasn't right I would refer to it. I read it in 7th grade and it really changed the way I looked on the world.I love the book and would reccomend it to every one who likes the Arthurian legends. I cared for charectors and when the died I cried, when they felt pain I did. Its on the top of my best books in the world list. The best
0440211727|5.0|A time to Kill was a great book, It was a very powerful book that kept me intrigued the whole way through, I recommend this book to anyone, that goes for all of Grisham's books, they are all wonderfu
0140187650|5.0|Arendt wrote the original version in the mid-sixties, based on her press coverage for the trial. Back then it was a controversial and it took tens of years for WW2 researches to take a wide look as she did 30 years ago.  <br /> I wonder where Amazon.com find a &quot;defense of Eichmann&quot; in her words. She presents various original and incisive arguments... non of them advocating his innocense. I think that the main feature is how Eichmann and his trial is put in context with perspective, and this makes the book an excellent history work.  <br />  The subtitle of the book summarizes it all: it is indeed a case of &quot;evil&quot; but it was banalized during the trial.
0440217563|5.0|I was given this book as a gift althought it was not the one I asked for.  It was a surprised to find a &quot;series&quot; book that was so self- contained.  Not knowing the history of Jamie and Claire turned this book into a mystery for me.  D. G. Does an excellent job of building suspense within a historical romance frame And still get a sense of continuation for her previous readers.  I haven't yet read Dragonfly or her the other sequels yet, though I look forward to it
0385486804|5.0|Last night I finished reading Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into the Wild&quot; and I am still thinking about it this morning. The story of Chris McCandless is one that most people can relate to in some way.  Who among us has not had the urge, while driving to work, to just keep on driving, past the office, and into parts unknown?  While reading this book, I found myself vacillating between condemnation of Chris McCandless' sometimes cavalier treatment of his family, and sheer envy of his courage to live his life as he wanted to.  The idea of living in the wild is undeniably appealing, but the responsibilities of life often pull us back into 'civilization'.        Readers will find this book enthralling.  Jon Krakauer has done a fine job of researching and presents the story in a detailed manner.  He also presents both the positives and negatives of Chris McCandless' actions.  If there is one negative about this book, it is that Krakauer injected a little too much of his own story.  His tale of mountain climbing in Alaska as a youth, while interesting, jarred the narrative of McCandless' story.  This negative aside, I recommend this book because of it's main character.  Chris McCandless, despite anything the reader may feel about the writing of this book, really leaps off of the page.  I wish I had known him.
0671747665|4.0|This book explains how oil affects our lives, our nation, the world's economy and political situations.  Yergin's writing style is superb, and although the material is somewhat dry, he really brings events to life.  This work is rare for non-fiction - it is easy reading and informative.  I have just finished the book a few minutes ago, and I really feel that I have learned a great deal.  My favorite section was on World War II.  I have read hundreds of books on the subject, but the section in &quot;The Prize&quot; dedicated to the War from a petroleum standpoint is superb
0446310786|5.0|This book tells about two young children growing up in the rural south, while their father, a lawyer, is dealing with a case that will change him, his children, and their town forever. I love the way that Harper Lee twists small details in with larger ones, all the while, keeping the reader's attention. Though the subject of racial discrimination is a tough subject, she deals with it in the easiest way possible. Though the story of Scout, Jem and Dill always seems to be in the spotlight, the reader gets more of a handle on Atticus's story. I think this story should be a national treasure, if it isn't one already
0684874350|5.0|This wonderfully written memoir tells of the sad childhood of an Irish Catholic family that struggles to maintain their dignity under the fist of the British.This book cannot be rated as 10 or best for fear that such tragic stories as like ones of the halocaust for they are too sad. I give you my word that by the end of this book you will have a newfound view for the &quot;luck of the Irish.&quot
0425129586|5.0|The first time I read this book was in my eighth grade language arts class.(right now I'm a ninth grader) I was assigned to read this agatha Christie book which I thought would never interest me, but when I started reading it I couldn't put it down!I finished the whole thing in one afternoon! It was so thrilling and suspenseful!after every chapter I told myself i would read the rest tommorrow but when the chapter ended I couldn't hold myself back.This book is a thrilling carnival ride in which the suspense never ended. It was a true mystery.This book was a tensely mind boggling story! Agatha Christie must have a real intellectual; imagination for writing books
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer does a tremendous job of tracking one of the lost souls that modern society paradoxically condones yet envies, disregards yet investigates. In a society where modern day stressors seem to dictate our every move, people like Chris McCandless, who have the courage to ignore the pressure and follow their spirits, should be emulated. McCandless touched many lives while he roamed. Through Krakauer's book, he continues to do so
0380713802|5.0|I got the book from a Japanese in the office (actually I took it). Never mind,  he will not be able to enjoy its content as I did. Being Belgian myself (with some travel experience), I appreciated very much Bills accurate description of our neighbour countries, especially Holland. Buy the book and learn about us Europeans
0930289234|5.0|Do not consider this book a mere comic book. To do that, would reduce this work in the minds of many people who do not read them regularly. For those of us who do, though, this work stands as the pinnacle of that art form. This book is Moore's crowning achievement in his field, and though you can see the same flashes of brilliance in his earlier works, Watchmen transcends all expectations superbly. An intricate script and some of the most fascinating detailed psychological character portrayals to be found in the realm of literature make this novel something to be savored and reread slowly
0060920386|5.0|Barbarians at the Gate is an excellent accounting of the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s.  It also serves as a primer on how Wall Street conducts business, as the reader can easily see ego clouding judgement and pride dictating the fate of one of history's biggest business deals.  The only thing possibly missing from ths book is an epilogue detailing RJR Nabisco's fate at the hands of KKR, although this doesn't detract from the story itself.    Barbarians is fairly light reading, considering the topic; one doesn't have to be an expert at Mergers &amp; Aquisitions, Leveraged Buyouts, or Corporate Finance in order to see the story unfold and understand it; Burrough and Helyar have done an excellent job of taking a complex and, in some cases, downright boring topic, and making it fairly digestible
1563523302|5.0|As a family wealth counselor we strive to get our clients focused on three topics.  First, how much they need to maintain their standard of living, second, how much do they want to leave their children and third, how much would they like to leave as a legacy to their favorite charities.  The millionaire next door does a great job in ch 5 &quot;Economic Outpatient Care&quot; of dealing with how  much you leave your children.  It shows that &quot;good intentions&quot; generally take you off mission and result in doing just the opposite -and making the children unproductive.  A client of mine built a statue of his father outside his headquarters with the caption -&quot;work is love&quot;.   Those that are &quot;given&quot; versus create seldom understand this. I believe this book is a must read for every financial advisor and their clients
0679457313|3.0|I had heard so much about this book that I ended  being disappointed when I did get to read it.  The descriptions that ring so true are really   those of a small self centered layer of society.  And as for magical use of language I much prefer  Rushdie.
0385472951|2.0|I've burned through most of Grisham's past books, devouring every word with rabid intensity... I was fully expecting this one to be another fast-paced rollercoaster ride through the inside world of lawyers and courtrooms.  I knew after the first chapter that this was not the Grisham we all know and love.<br /><br />_The Partner_ has to rate as the worst Grisham book I have read, although it was still better than a great deal of the literary torture I've found myself subjected to.  It might actually be a decent read if you go into it expecting to kill some time instead of _A Time to Kill_.  Not only was the plot was predictable almost to the point of being insulting, but the main character was smugly unlikeable and more than a little annoying.  By the last third of the book, I was hoping something would go wrong for seemingly invincible Patrick.  I'd grown to dislike him so much that the ending (if one can call it that, seems like the word &quot;ending&quot; implies some finality) gave me a sick little thrill.<br /><br /> All in all, the book seemed terribly contrived.  It read like a draft for a movie script and left the distinct impression that Grisham plans a sequel.  Sure, I'll read it if there is one (I'm still a Grisham fan, albeit a sorely disappointed one) but I won't be looking forward to it as I have his other novels.  And if there's a movie, I'll see it on cable if I see it at all!
0679722610|5.0|The posters for the Bruce Willis blood-fest Last Man Standing credit the original story to Akira Kurosawa's insanely funny destroying-the-town-to-save-it movie Yojimbo (AS IF Bruce Willis had an earthly of filing the blood-and-dust soaked waraji of Mifune).   And there, for the majority of movie-goers, no doubt, the story begins and ends.  Unless you know Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest.  Unless you've ripped through the pages in an agonizing  frenzy of suspense and awe, desperate to find out WHAT HAPPENS NEXT but hanging on to each page a second longer to savor the impeccable use of words, the flawless balance between economy and imagery, the sheer perfection of the writing.  It's gang warfare in Poisonville, set in motion by the venomous old snake whose bite sickened the town in the first place.  Poisonville is an oozing sore ripe for cleaning, and the Continental Op cleans it with a vengeance.    Wolf this one down in one gulp the first time through and then start over again at the beginning and linger over the sweet taste of nastiness made delicious through the brilliance of a master word-chef.  Hammet perfected the hard-boiled private eye genre even as he invented it.  The genre would have been complete had no-one ever written another word in it

0452273331|1.0|The great novelist Vladimir Nabokov -- who, like Ayn Rand, was a member of the Russian diaspora that followed the Russian Revolution -- published  a collection of his lectures on Russian literature  that he gave as a lecturer at Cornell University,  entitled _Lectures on Russian Literature_.  During  one such lecture, he had this to say about  Soviet-era literature -- &quot;We all know these bulky  best-sellers _All Quiet on the Don_, _Not by Bread  Possessed_, and _Zed's Cabin_ -- mountains of  triteness, plateaus of platitudes, which are called 'powerful' and 'compelling' by foreign reviewers.&quot; (p. 8)  Nabokov here was specifically referring to the product of the so-called &quot;Social Realist&quot; school of literature -- an admittedly God-awful genre; however, even the most casual perusal of _The Fountainhead_ would convince a sensible reader that &quot;mountains of triteness, plateaus of platitudes&quot; sums up this book quite well, too.  And HOW trite and HOW platitudinous _The Fountainhead_ is!  Aesthetically, the characters are more wooden than the Black Forest, and as believable as a Grimm Brothers fairytale; the conversation stilted; the plotting clumsy and predictable.  As for the &quot;ideas,&quot; these are nothing more than a confused melange of refried Nietzsche, Social-Darwinism, and a near-sociopathic egotism and greed.  And perhaps no more damning critique of contemporary America exists, than when one considers that this steaming pile of utter rubbish and its offshoots (Objectivism, libertarianism, the rest of the Rand oeuvre) has become so influential in the lives and thinking of so many Americans.  P.S.:  I would have given this book a &quot;1&quot; except for two things:  1)  _Atlas Shrugged_ is even worse; 2) Ayn Rand HAS done something I thought no writer, no matter how inept, would ever do -- she wrote BORING sex scenes.
0060801263|5.0|I had to read this book for my summer reading before I went to the 9th grade.  I thought that it would be a drag reading it because it was so long, but I didn't really take a long finishing the book.  I liked this book because it was very realistic.  I could fit right in with Francie.  Even though the story took place in the early 1900's, I felt that it could've took place today.  I felt an instant connection with Francie once I picked up the book
0812550706|4.0|A delightful book to read!  One of Card's strengths is to put his characters in awkward or difficult situations.  Ender's problems lie in different areas; his affection for his sister, his strained relationship with his older brother (who was &quot;bred&quot; to be what Ender became, but wasn't stable enough), and his constant pressure as one of the smallest and youngest boys in his &quot;academy&quot;.  Card writes well, showing us how a young child can prevail, under enormous external pressures, with skill, courage, persistence, and a little humanity.  It is something of a shame that his sequels were a nasty progression downhill, resembling more like a publisher's attempt to milk a cash cow than capturing Card's writing skills.  My recommendation:  Read Ender's Game, you will find it very enjoyable, but don't bother with &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, or any future sequels.  Nuf sed.
0446347949|5.0|In my opinion, the only marketing concept from the practitioer that break into the academic marketing textbook.  As a part-time lecturer in Marketing in Bangkok Thailand, I recommend the book to all my students.  (The article that I assigned to all my students is &quot;Marketing Myopia&quot; by Ted Levitt)  I have also received good feedback from my students. It's also the reason I read other of the authors' book.  This one is the one I like most though.  I am reading the &quot;New&quot;Positioning at the time being.  The first time I read it, I just can't put it down and finish in one pass laying on the couch in the MBA lounge during my graduate studies' day at 10 pm.  Imagine how addicted and interesting the book is.  If you want to see the practioner side of marketing. READ IT!
0312954468|5.0|There are those who will criticize this enjoyable little novel for its deviations from &quot;true&quot; Egyptian history. One might as well fuss at Columbus for missing his target and bumping into America instead. Sometimes a book's most endearing feature is its readability, and River God has that in surplus. From the tongue-in-cheek humor of Taita, the narrator of the tale, to the archetype romance between the high-born daughter of the Vizier and the lowly soldier (with a great deal of intrigue thrown in), this delightful story is guaranteed to get your attention. Its very unlikeliness makes it all the more fun to read - like reading a grocery store tabloid without the guilt. Smith is a gifted writer with a wonderful sense of humor, and though a few technical points may get knocked off here and there, I would not hesitate to recommend the story of Taita, Lostris, and Tanis to my dearest friends (but they won't get MY copy!).   You certainly don't have to be a fan of ancient Egypt to enjoy this book - anyone who likes to read a good adventure story ( a la &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;) will appreciate its excellent pacing and classic hero/villain conflict - plus the wry humor sprinkled throughout will make you grin when you least expect it. The two lovers are perfect to a T, while the scurrying slave makes up in hubris what he lacks by his master's hand. And like the river it echoes, the storyline waves in and out of rocky spots, hits whirlpool eddies of action, and (only rarely) stagnates. While the end may not be satisfying in the happily-ever-after sense, it left me content in the knowledge that no one's future was a mystery. Wilbur Smith wraps up each loose end with all the care of a royal embalmer. And yet  there are a few questions to be answered in the sequel... hmm... guess I know what's next on my reading list..
0671004107|5.0|Contact was the first book in a very long time to touch my soul and make me seriously question what we are all doing here and why?  My head tells me one thing, while my heart tells me another.  I believe Ellie faced the same dilemna.  Without giving away any of the plot, Ellie searches for answers about the eventual whereabouts of loved ones after they have passed from our Earth.  Although the book has a lot of technical language (consider it a learning experience) it is well worth the read
0312955006|5.0|A real winner.  Quite a deviation from his other Harry Bosch novels.  Exiciting to the end, and you really get to hate the prosecutor here
0385472951|4.0|I love to read Grisham for the fast paced legal scheming and stategy, and this book really delivers.  Grisham lets the reader experience the action by slowly weaving the plot and subplots together and doing so in such a way that keeps the story flowing at a fast pace.  I would have ranked this book as my favorite over A Time To Kill and given it a score of 10 but for the ending which came out of nowhere and proved a bitter dissapointment
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt has finally given me a perspective on my Irish-American/Catholic upbringing.  There were many things I never understood in my Irish Mother's attitude towards being Irish until I read this book.<br />    McCourt shatters the typically American images of Ireland with leprechans dancing at the end of rainbows in a patchwork green countryside.  The bleak realities of life for the Irish are told with a wit and wisdom which softens the often disturbing images of McCourt's childhood.<br />  This book leaves the reader wanting more . . . What happened when you got here Frank?  We all want to know!!!!!
0312853238|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time and i have read a lot of books. I've already read it three times. The characters are so interesting especially Ender. He is so cool. I love ever single page of this book it is so exciting. Once I start reading it I stay up all night untill I finish it I just can't set it down. Anyone who hasn't read this book yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!! I can't wait for the movie to come out
0684874350|5.0|That Frank McCourt can recount the almost unspeakably dismal circumstances of his childhood without a trace of bitterness or blame is nothing short of miraculous.  That he can lace the whole sad tale with so much Irish humor is nothing short of genius.  Thank you, Frank McCourt for this heartwarming and inspiring tale of hope and despair, tears and laughter, sorrow and joy, and the unconditional love of a child for his hopelessly flawed parents.  I eagerly await it's sequel
0385472951|3.0|I read the book before reading any of these reviews, and I admit I agree with many of the critiques of the book's plot, characterization and unsatisfactory ending. Upon reflection, however, I wonder if Grisham is driving at a different message.<br /><br />Consider the issues he's taken on in previous books: A Time to Kill was a statement against racism, The Chamber was his argument against the death penalty, The Rainmaker challenged the health insurance industry, and The Runaway Jury took on big tobacco. But this book doesn't have a real villain, at least not in some institutional form. The only thing that motivates all the main characters is the cry, &quot;Show me the money!&quot;<br /><br />And here is perhaps the thrust of the novel. Grisham explores the corrupting power of greed, evidenced through lawsuit and litigation. No one is immune. Lives are shipwrecked and ethics are compromised because of the seductive desire for untold millions. Even those we believe to be noble are not above selling out their closest loved ones.<br /><br />Though part of me desperately wanted a different ending, it serves as a striking commentary on utter emptiness of those whose ultimate goal is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It also reminds us once again that the best laid plans of mice, men and even Grisham heroes go aft agley.
0786209798|1.0|I was completely absorbed by this book -- for the first 50 pages.  Then I was overwhelmed by a completely unlikable, unbelievable protaganist.  John Corey apparently meets only single, attractive, available women everywhere he turns that find him irresistable despite the fact that he thinks, acts and speaks like a half-witted 10 year-old.  A little bit of this went a long, long way.  This book was a sorry disappointment and it's hard to believe it was written by the same person who wrote The Gold Coast, The General's Daughter and Word of Honor.  Pick one of these up instead -- you'll be glad you did
0684874350|5.0|I just read the previously written reviews and am amazed that many people rate it 9 or 10 and then someone comes along and says it's the worst book they ever read and couldn't finish it!  The latter group of people just didn't get it...The mode of Frank McCourt's writing was ingenious becuase it was put down in the vernacular of the age he was writing about.  It was very subtle in it's progress, so much so that you didn't realize it was happening.      To know that such poverty and sadness was survived and overcome is the reason one MUST read this book.  I would recommend buying the book if only to contribute to Mr. McCourt's pocketbook!!    I only wish I knew what happened to Mam and the rest of the family.  Definitely a sequel scenerio!    I LOVED the quote about Shakespeare and mashed  potatoes.  I have used it numerous times...it's  priceless...    To y'all who dissed this book...shame on ya!!!
0517591812|4.0|For those who do not like to read history, &quot;London&quot; provides a fascinating look at one of the world's foremost cities.  Its chapters are almost like short stories in that they concentrate on a particular period in history yet one feels the need to follow the characters' ancestors through to the next era.  I didn't expect to like it half as much as I did and recommend it to history and literary buffs alike
0451191935|5.0|Although I almost detest these books, I cannot,  with good conscience, give them anything less   than a ten.  I began reading these books to   silence my fiancee's nagging.  Now I read them,   not for pleasure, but as a result of a sick sort   of fascination . . . one which I find I enjoy   altogether too much.  Reading these books has   been frighteningly similar to watching what   looks like a fur-covered lump appear on the   horizon of the highway.  However much you tell   yourself that looking will only cause you grief,   you cannot tear your eyes away.  You hope for   the small chance of relief when you realize it   was just a tire or someone's old, crumpled shirt.    With the Bachman books, most often, you have to look away at the last second with that sinking,   sickening feeling in your stomach.  <br />  Not to say that this is bad.  The complex journey   Bachman creates, from the time you spot the lump to the time you pass it, gives brilliant insight   into the nature of the characters, in particular,   and people, in general.  In this way Bachman envelops readers in the story, enticing and forcing them along in a straightforward, bold, untamed manner, completely distinct from that of Stephen King
0684874350|4.0|This book is an enjoyable record of the life and thoughts of the author as a little boy growing up in Ireland in the 30's and 40's.  The account puts you inside a world long gone which has beauty and meaning given today's social and ecological upheaval.  Frank McCourt recounts not only the events but also the often hilarious opinions of his younger self.  Throughout, the tale is uplifting and amusing despite hardship and loss.  A fascinating look inside another person's life
0899663036|5.0|This is one of the few books that have made me cry. When a book makes me cry, it means that I have felt,throughout the book that I was in the book. Not as Francie, but as Francie's best friend who lives a better life than her. I still get sad when I think about it
0394583892|5.0|I like DeMille and this book is no exception.  It's fast easy reading...no great message...an enjoyable book.  The sarcastic narration reminds me of Lawrence Sanders' &quot;McNally&quot;
044651506X|5.0|I took this great book with me on a recent family camping trip,and became more and more engrossed with it at every turn of the page. Mr Demille's talent for dialog,suspense and his ever present sense of humor made for &quot;never can put in down&quot; reading...even by lantern light with the moths keeping me company!
0684874350|5.0|I picked this book up after hearing Terry Gross interview Frank McCourt on &quot;Fresh Air&quot;.  I thought his story sounded interesting, but when I actually started to read his story, I was incredibly moved by its depth.  I never expected to be so taken in!  It is heartbraking and heartwarming at the same time, and the humor makes the pain you will experience reading it bearable.  It is truly incredible that Mr. McCourt survived his childhood, and what's more, evolved into a brilliant writer
0385482582|4.0|Only very few people are frank to share their experiences leading to success without being pathetic; Andy Grove is one of them.  His insides and his management style definitely create a new kind of role model manager. His advice is very applicable, and if realized would enhance the business atmosphere most probably in any company.  My critique on his book is that he did not even bother to mention where most of his ideas came from. For instance, his paranoia can be traced back to Igor Ansoff who developed the early warning systems, first for defence purposes later for business. Grove' s point of reigning in chaos has already been propagated by Tom Peters, and the loose organizational structure are at home at Henry Mintzberg.   One can appreciate the fact that these concepts have been applied in reality, although, a mentioning of these business gurus in a footnote would have been welcome. One has to remember that his book is a &quot;How to do&quot; manual and not a &quot;Where it came from&quot; encyclopedia, therefore it cannot become an academic textbook.   Nevertheless, very few business leaders are entering the hall of fame and are contributing to the business conduct as Andy Grove does.
060600680X|5.0|Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is undoubtedly his greatest work, and arguably the greatest American novel of the 20th Century.  Told in Hemingway's unique style, it is easy to understand but keeps the reader thinking for hours.  Robert Jordan, the novel's main character, enters the Civil War in Spain, his mission being to destroy a supply bridge.  He soon falls in love with Maria, a young girl whose life was almost lost in the war. <br /> At the conclusion of the novel, after the bridge has been destroyed and Jordan is attempting to flee, he is injured and it becomes apparent that he will soon die.  Maria, who is in love with him, refuses to leave despite Jordan's pleas for her to do so, until he finally convinces her that he will always be with her.  His words bring to mind the sermon by John Donne that the title for the book was taken from.  Donne states that everyone is part of one big entity, part of the  &quot;island&quot; of humanity, and we are reminded that Jordan is part of Maria, and all the rest of humanity
0345315227|1.0|As sad as this may sound, I would have expected better from a first-time hack writer.  This is hardly ACC at his prime; the plot was utterly contrived, consisting of little more than a repeat of chapters from the previous three books with some glue in between.  As an attempt to add some suspense, the reader is treated to an ending worthy of Hollywood: the Monolith becomes the villain of the story, with our heroes involved in a gratuitous battle to save Earth.  The deus ex machina solution, of course, consists of one (1) supercomputer virus, Jeff Goldblum, and a Powerbook. Wait - I must have confused this with Independence Day.<br /><br />  This series has definitely reached a new low point with the 3001: Final Odyssey. I do not relish the thought of yet another literary atrocity, just in case the publishers are even contemplating a sequel.  Avoid at all costs.
0399128964|5.0|Read it. Just read it and find out fet yerself
0394583892|5.0|Put down whatever you're reading and pick this up! The more you read the more tense it gets.  Two yuppie-type scientists working at a secret government installation living beyond their means are murdered.  Our hero, a chauvinistic smart-alec wisecracking NYPD cop, is convalescing on Long Island from line-of-duty wounds.  He is a friend of the local police chief who asks him to &quot;consult&quot; on the case.  The Feds try to stonewall the investigation of their now-deceased employees. The consensus is that the victims were trying to sell their science to the highest bidder and got themselves killed instead.  Detective John Corey, since tossed from the case by the local fuzz, thinks there is something flawed with the conventional wisdom.  He correctly concludes that the victims' greed had nothing to do with their government work.  He discovers who the bad guy is.  The bad guy then proceeds to kill more innocent folks to cover his tracks inf the original killings.  Detective Corey sets out to kill the bad guy, who tries to kill him.  Good guy 1.  Bad guy 0.  The one-liners are clever, but sometimes a bit much.  However they don't distract from a suspense-filled story that builds to the end.  This will keep you up late at night.
044651506X|3.0|Yes, I was there. I am one of the few who set foot on Plum Island, 7 years of my life as a research scientist in those laboratories.  The author's descriptions of the island, its history, its facilities along with the North Fork are quite accurate.  Lots of pleasant and exciting memories.   But I must give this book only a six.  It is easy to read, fast paced and has sufficient tension to provide an eagerness to read on.  However, there are a few negatives: 1) the unnecessary, filthy language to titilate the unimaginative reader; 2) the lack of adequately developed alternatives (and misleading clues)for identifying the murderer [this is definitely not an Agatha Cristie novel]; and 3) a few entirely predictable events, interactions and dialogs.  I am convinced this would make an exciting Harrison Ford movie with the bumbling bureaucrats, sinister sycophants, and scared scientists.  Enjoy if you will.
0399142851|1.0|Unnatural Exposure is over-exposure of Cornwell full of herself.  It deserved a rejection slip
1563523302|5.0|Sure, this book may not tell us anything we couldn't have thought of ourselves, but the depth of research and excellent delivery by the authors make this one of the top three best books ever on the subject. Right up there with Charles J.Givens and Andrew Tobias. An eye-opening must read (for anyone who doesn't want to be poor all their life)
0312955006|5.0|Looking desperately for new authors (having read through everything else in my collection twice), I bought &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; on a whim while standing in a Wal-Mart shopping line.  I finished it in a little over a day and a half; I couldn't put it down (and wanted to sacrifice everything else to finish it).  Subsequently, I inadvertently read the whole Bosch trilogy (&quot;The Last Coyote&quot; had not yet come out) from back to front, then re-read them in the proper order.  Connelly can paint a seedy scene with the best of them.  Highly recommended, but not for those with weak stomachs
0446520950|4.0|Did he die or didn't he?  What's on the disk?  Who has the disk?  Who's the man with the blue eyes? And how is the president of the Federal Reserve linked to our very likable but insignificant hero? You'll have to read &quot;Total Control&quot; by David Baldacci to find out the answers to these questions and all the others that enter your mind. David Baldacci grabs your interest with the first paragraph. The characterization is terrrific.  I was quite taken by the protagonist, Sidney.  She is part of the plot from beginning to end and refuses to play the typically passive female victim common to so many thrillers.  My only complaint was a few very blunt clues and a slight drag to the story somewhere around the middle of the book.  But it's well worth the read.  Now I can't wait for the movie!  I wonder who'll play Sidney???
1556154844|5.0|Read this book. Then read it again. After that read it another time. Leave it on your desk (should be pretty used up by now). Have other people steal it  (start a new thread of reading) Buy another copy. Loop.  I think that I never found a computer book that so appealing, well written and with the right amount of detail about almost all is needed to create software, from variable definitions to managing psychology of people. I read it two times already and each time I'm amazed. I gifted it to a friend of mine as a wedding gift and he almost divorced because he read it while doing his honeymoon
0399142851|2.0|Am I the only one who's willing to say that the empress is buck naked? Though I've loved most of her previous Scarpetta novels -- absolutely NOT the last one which starts with the sunken body and ends unbelievably with terrorists from out of the blue -- I simply can't stand it any more. &quot;Unnatural Exposure&quot; had the weakest ending I've ever read in a major author's work. Hint: when I figured out who the evil-doer was, I had to go back quickly leafing through the book to remember who the heck this person was!!! I suppose that one person's &quot;unexpected plot twist&quot; is another's totally lame climax. If you love this ending, you'll love being left hanging about Lucy's new &quot;dilemma&quot; which is simply forgotten and unresolved.  I was willing to put up with the &quot;cribs&quot; and &quot;squirrels&quot; once more, but this is it. Even though I'm a student of forensic science novels, I can't take Patricia any more. I think she needs to take a break and practice writing a novel with a reasonable ending again.    Sigh...
1878574590|5.0|Frank Miller, the man who masterminded The Dark Knight Returns, Ronin, and Elektra, once again shocks audiences with Sin City.    Marv, a guy who couldn't afford a hooker with all the money in the world because he's so ugly, gets one amazing night with his dream girl. When he wakes up the next day to find her dead, Marv vows to get back in a big way on the people that did in the only person who was ever nice to him.    The artwork is phenomenal, and it creates a perfect atmosphere for the setting Miller creates.  Marv is as close to real as a fictitious character can get. With excellent narrative, Miller combines great art and a great story together and creates some of his best work yet.
006017322X|5.0|Good book. A must very read. Good for brain. keep an eye on you eyes when you read thes book!!!
0395860210|5.0|I loved this book.  Roth had become so hard to read in recent years that I was reluctant to pick this up but I found it as enjoyable as anything he has ever done.  A pentrating look into the lives of my father's generation, men of limitless ambition but limited abilities.  It chilled me to the bone.  It said so much about being Jewish in America in the 20th century and about being american post world war 2 that it should be required reading in college history classes.  Of course, it is written in the typical roth prose, shining like a gem throghout.  I recommend this to everyone I know and even though it was slow in parts -- why is that such a crime?  isn't real life slow in parts, too? -- i was very sorry when it ended.  Mazeltov to Roth but this is a book for non-jews as well.  The Swede is one of the great characters of modern american fiction.  fantastic
0345389409|5.0|I thought this was one of the best books I've read from Anne Rice.  She made you actually think about the devil--whether he was lying to Lestat the whole time and giving him false images or telling the truth and actually needed help.  This book gave you no choice but to think about religion,  not only the good side but the bad.  Anyone who wants a thinking book should read this one.
B0000025RI|5.0|Is there any question why this is the biggest selling album of all time? There shouldn't be. Jackson mixes rock, soul, jazz, pop and Carribean music all on one album. With Quincy Jones, Paul McCartney and Eddie Van Halen on board, this album is a true classic. END
0446310786|5.0|I originally picked up this book for my 10th grade summer reading list and at my mom's suggestion. At first, the book is rather slow, but carries a good story line; however, once you get past the first hundred pages, things really speed up and you can't put it down. What's more, it is definitely identifiable with reality; everything the kids did is certainly in the realm of what kids do every day. The most sad part of this book is that, although this book was published almost forty years ago, everything in there could still happen today - and by that, I mean everything that had to do with the trial
0425107469|5.0|My very first and most favorite Koontz novel.  I've been hooked on this author ever since.  I've read and own every one of his novels, but Watchers remains the most beloved and most often read of them all
0385484518|5.0|I've thought about Mitch and Morrie every day since I read this book.  Morrie's wisdom puts  all of life's worries in perspective.  I think of Morrie every time I am driving and screaming at people to go faster or move out of my way.  I wonder what Morrie would say to me and this calms me.  I had the opportunity to meet Mitch Albom and his love for his mentor was so moving.  I appreciate the little things so much more now-- the color of the sky when the sun is setting, my loved ones' laughs, the familiar and comfortable friendship I share with my sisters
1563523302|4.0|This book's findings are intuituively obvious, but many will fail to see the light. Sure, there are some silly statistics, such as the cost per pound of car. However, it does tell you what the majority of affluent do (independent business owners, including MD's and lawyers), what they do with their money (save more than they spend - well, gosh, just do the math all of you who doubt this), and what they need to do to teach their children about money and frugality (something which will come in handy with my six year old daughter).  The issue of spouses being equally frugal is very important. My wife was not frugal, in part, because she was taught not to be frugal by her parents. Her parents' habit of spending more than they earned has left them working at age 68 in fulltime jobs, with income of nearly $80,000 per year, with no retirement in sight (and not because they do not want to retire). It was not until I pointed out to my wife that her parent's situation has a cause, and they are living the 'effect', that see realized that she did not want to be in that situation. Most people do not realize that this lack of savings behavior is taught to them by their parents (mine included). My days of eating peanut butter sandwiches in college, because I generally never had more than $10 a week to spend on food (this was in the late 70's, early '80's), made me realize the requirements of frugality (no frugality = no food).  Do these well-do-do people, who live beneath their means, live boring lives? Well, my family is among those folks, and I do not think our lives are boring. We have traveled to Europe and Asia numerous times (perhaps 9 or 10 times in the past 13 years) - usually I am on a business trip and my family comes with me. Do I have a life outside of work - yep. I love white water rafting, fly fishing, and sailing. Do we give to charity? Absolutely. Like most others in my boat, we rarely discuss these aspects of our lives, as they are generally done with our families, and what we do with our families is not discussed in public. This is likely why a lot of this qualitative fluff is not found in this book.  Understand that it has taken 17 years to do this... hence the epicureans among you will find that this path to be very difficult to follow. For those of you who have the patience to make a change in your financial behavior, the rewards are significant. Where do you want to be, financially, in 15-20 years? This book will suggest the behaviorial changes needed to make a positive effect on that picture for the overwhelming majority of people who wish to be financially successful in the US. As with anything else in America, it is your choice to change your behavior. Read the book, and best of luck
0517591812|2.0|The characters are poorly drawn, not particularly sympathetic and appear to be only vehicles for conveying a history lesson.  If it were not for the occasional, and fun, etomology lesson, this tome just might become only the second book I've ever failed to finish (and I've slogged through a vast number of books).<br /><br />Although Michener's history is suspect, his volumes are far more amusing and this book, as a novel, does not compare.
0399128964|5.0|If there were only 1 series of books that I could keep I would choose Dune by Frank Herbert over all others. Over The Lord of the Rings, over Ursula Leguins Earthsea trilogy (quadroly?). It is a classic both in the world of Science Fiction and of all literature. The revolution that takes place is so realistic it could be happening outside you window. When you finish you check the news to make sure it isn't actually happening, and when you realize that it isn't you pick up the sequel and when you finish that you read the next 4 in the series and then you read it again
0684874350|4.0|I've read dozens of books about growing up in difficult circumstances.  Most I've forgotten, a few linger and fewer still stay fresh.  Manchild In The Promised Land, read decades ago, floats close to the surface. <br /> The books of this genre that succeed are those that capture the specifics of person and place within a larger historical context.  Angela's Ashes, on first reading, appears to have done this fairly well.  I know in an important way that the poor Irish Catholic boy of Limerick and the poor Black Protestant boy of Brooklyn had little in common except their misery and their joys. <br /> Is Angela's Ashes an important book?  I'll tell you in another few years.  Is it a good read?  It is

0345363132|5.0|Penman's books (all of which I have read and enjoyed immensely) are among the best reads I have experienced.  They are impossible to put down.  She has the gift of creating vivid, lovable (and often dispicable) characters out of the great figures of British history.  Glorious and bloody battles, great alliances and viscious betrayals, abundant wealth and abject poverty, romance and heartbreak -- this is the England that Penman creates for us, and in writing that is often mesmerizing. When friends ask me for recommendations for vacation reading, Penman tops my list.  It is a true puzzlement to me that she is not a bestseller.
0671004107|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  I would recommend it conditionally to a friend.  The story itself was not as important as the interesting and provacative decisions and positions taken by those faced with the real possibility of contact with extraterestrials.  I kept wondering if it might be better if Ellie and friends could be removed from the text.  It still could stand up as worthy non-fiction book
0451163516|5.0|Anyone who has read a lot of Follett knows that he usually chooses a distinct time and place in history for his setting.  While Pillars of the Earth (set in 1150) and The Eye of the Needle (WWII) are excellent, this WWI-set novel is a masterpiece.  I enjoy anything Follett puts to paper, but this goes beyond even my highest expectations.  There are some subtle turns-of-phrase in this work that show us why Follett is a genuis.  You will enjoy his Feliks character even when you feel you sometimes shouldn't!  A definite 11 on a 1 to 10 scale
0451163486|5.0|I do not want to reveal any plot points, but I can only say that the TITLE of this book is more chilling than you know.  An excellent read.  I am a voracious reader who enjoys Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal, Leon Uris, Colleen McCullough, Stephen King, Maeve Binchy, Olivia Goldsmith, Anne Tyler and many more, but Ken Follett is by far my favorite.  He turns a phrase with a perfection that can be seen not only here but in The Man from St. Petersburg, Night over Water, and Pillars of the Earth.  I highly recommend them all.  The suspense in The Eye of the Needle does not stop until you put the book down, which you will not do until you have finished it.  Enjoy

0060175184|4.0|Amazing how a story with absolutely vile, immoral protagonists; a plot that both adds to and takes away the glamour of the newspaper universe; &amp; certainly nothing that you can really indentify with; takes hold of you, plunges you into its scheming, sordid world &amp; changes forever the way you'll look at a newspaper again!!<BR> <br /><BR> Bina Mathews<BR> Dubai, U.

0060976624|5.0|Witty and urbane, Thank You For Smoking never lets up on the satire.  I found myself laughing out loud.  Geneticists now have proof that cynic eloquence is hereditary.  Characters well developed.  Plot is fast moving and easily readable.  Love at first puff.  Darrell Hawkin
0060801263|5.0|I must say, I was taken aback by the superbness (don't know if that's a word) of the hard, depressive reality in this masterpiece.  Being 13 years of age, I am going into the eight grade, and therefore, must read four books over the summer for school.  Well, a friend of mine suggested I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, and, my being a skepticist, I said &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;  &quot;Yeah&quot; is right!  This is one of the best books I've read since I was five years old when I started to read.    It is, as I've said, negatively veritable, and I am a great fan and avid reader of real, in-your-face publications.  Usually I read macabre, gory mystery, and basically ghoulish stuff, but when I read this book, my point of view did a total 180*.  Macabre may be physically gory, but wonderful, realistic books like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are emotionally and mentally &quot;gory&quot;.  Emotional depression is, at least I think, the backbone of marvelous, expressive writing; I believe that this book is one of the only of its kind to provide that backbone in a way that separates it from unreal story-telling.  Bravo, Ms. Smith, bravo.                    H.S.
0553278223|5.0|This is a strange book, but in the absolutely great way!!!  Bradbury did a impeccable job crafting characters and dialogues.  There is one surprise after another.  The book is a collection of loosely connected stories and each one never fails to amaze me.  It was astounding to see that the Martians acted like humans!!!  This is a masterpiece and is a must-read for any science-fiction fan
0312853238|5.0|I used to work in a science fiction specialty book store.  Occasionally, people would come in the store and, without knowing anything about science fiction, ask for a recommendation of a good sf book to read.  We kept a supply of Ender's Game on hand and would always recommend it in this situation.  We offered a money-back guarantee if they didn't like the book.  No one ever returned for their money back, but some people did come back asking for more.  We'd suggest Speaker for the Dead.  After personally recommending Ender's Game to dozens and dozens of perfect strangers, I can honestly say that I've never known anyone who didn't enjoy reading the book.  READ IT
0553377906|5.0|Margaret Atwood explores the human psyche in this poignant novel about a female protagonist who takes a retrospective on her life by painting pictures of her childhood.  Atwood uses different colors to describe the world of artist Elaine Risley.  And the use of flashbacks was very effective in telling the story.  The main conflict of the novel deals with the reconciliation of Elaine with Cordelia, her childhood tormentor.  There is an Elaine and also a Cordelia in all of us, always fighting for domination.  Elaine could also be Atwood's alter ego, since their childhood events sometimes coincide.  I enjoyed this book very much (though it could've been shorter) and would recommend it to any man and woman
1884822312|5.0|The Biggest (physically) Chess book I've ever seen!  But more importantly, the Best approach to teaching -- a proven approach. It's uniqueness is that the book is almost Entirely Pictures.  Not a belabored analysis of why's &amp; how-to's -- just page after page of DO IT, DO IT, DO IT.  Right Brain Heaven.  Lazlo Polgar used these *puzzles* to teach his three daughters the game -- two of them currently enjoy world rank.  I use the word &quot;enjoy&quot; because that is what this book has done for *my* chessplaying.  My entire approach is now keyed to the checkmate (but then perhaps that is because the first 360 of the 5334 are &quot;White to Move and Mate in One&quot; and I am only on 211 :^).  Next section will be &quot;White to Move and Mate in Two&quot;.  So, hopefully, I will broaden out.  But FUN is what Chess has become -- and my games are much more interesting -- I take more chances -- I ENJOY !!
0446310786|5.0|An excellent book about racism and how a white family helps to combat it.  Very heartfelt.  A triumph.  This book is filled with hopes that we can end bigotry.  Harper Lee told a great story that will live on.  Highly Recommended

0449227421|4.0|Probably not the best of Follet, however it managed to keep me awake on a Korsika beach while the sun was heating ! The basic idea is quite interesting but the characters are not very deep ones...A good synopsis for a film
0783815484|5.0|To be completly honest, I would rate this book thirteen, but that's not an option. This work of art has many unique features. Though the story is short and the synopsis sounds child-like, the layers of meaning are clearly meant for more comprehensive readers. The vocabulary displayed also betrays the mature audience the book was written for.  The end struck me as particularly profound.  It is the sort of literature that leaves you numb in your chair after finishing.  Thinking about it for hours without tire has led me to the conclusion that this book that appears to be for a mere child is truly magnificent, and meant for all.  I would recommend that children, if you read it, pick it up again when you have grown older.  You will uncover more treasures with each pasing year. ( I persinally am only thirteen, but I have read numerous amounts of literature and ahve considered myslef to be a valid critic of age level and such.
0553093029|5.0|This book fleshes out all of the worlds featured in the STAR WARS TRILOGY, Episodes 4-6, from Dagobah and Tatooine to Coruscant and Alderaan!  Each world has its own chapter, which has a splendid and detailed narrative.  To illustrate the narratives a wealth of Ralph McQuarrie's exquisite paintings (created for the production of the Trilogy) are featured.  A well-done book and a must-have for any STAR WARS fan or sci-fi art buff.<BR>  --RK
0399142851|4.0|Not Patricia Cornwell's best work.  As with her last novel, Hornet's Nest, I felt that the ending was a little too abrupt.  Not only did I feel that there were subplots which were left unresolved (perhaps for the next book), but the one which was resolved seemed to have the potential to carry a little more weight and could have added value to the book
0441003257|5.0|I'd like to add this: If you happen to be one of those people who thought ending up someday running a tiny old bookshop tucked away in a nice, inconspicuous corner of London would be a pretty neat idea - beware! This line of business is fraught with danger &amp; you might meet a few people that are not really quite who/what they seem to be... For all those who love reading customer reviews I'd like to put in a coss-reference to another author, Diana Wynne Jones, who supposedly writes children's literature(!)... Neil Gaiman is a fan of hers, apparently
0449227421|4.0|KEN FOLLETT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST AUTHORS AROUND.  BOOKS LIKE &quot;THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH, EYE OR THE NEEDLE, ETC...&quot;  ARE CLASSIC, BUT HIS RECENT STUFF, THE LAST 3 BOOKS ARE CERTAINLY MORE HOLLYWOODISH. THE PLOTS ARE LIGHTER, BUT THE BOOKS ARE FUN AND ENJOYABLE.  IT ALMOST SEEMS THAT FOLLETT HAS TOTALLY CHANGED HIS WRITING STYLE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. ALL IN ALL, I ALWAYS ENJOY HIS BOOKS, MAINLY BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY HE WRITES.  THE THIRD TWIN, WAS SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE, FAST MOVING, AND A GOOD READ
0385470819|5.0|A powerful story that shows how much a father cares about his daughter. Carl Lee went to jail taking revenge for his daughter. The thing I think is a failure though is why the Klan took Ellen. Why did Mickey Mouse help Ellen if he rung up at Jake's house and said 'someone's going to die tonight?' But apart from that, this book is a powerful novel from the beginning to end. Well done John!
0385484518|5.0|What to say I just finished &quot;tuesdays with morrie&quot;  and  can't stop weeping a wonderful book , about death but so life affirming can't imagine anyone reading it and not  come away with a desire to live everyday to the fullest. Morrie and Mitch will be with me forever
0399142851|3.0|This was an enjoyable read -- similar to how eating vanilla ice cream is enjoyable -- but certainly not the calibre of storytelling I've come to expect from Ms. Cornwell.  Usually, after I finish a Scarpetta book, I immediately re-read it.  Not this time.  The story was good -- but the ending was too tidy and put together too quickly.  Very happy to see the ghost of Mark being put to rest -- get over it already and move on, Kay!  Yes, I am looking forward to the next Scarpetta novel, but I will wait for it to come out in paperback before forking over the big bucks for hardback.  Not enough of Pete Marino in this one.  Also, I love Lucy -- perhaps a Lucy series about the stuff she works on and her cases for the FBI
0671004107|3.0|This would have made an excellent short story.  There were good philosophical and theological undertones.  I felt that the story was too long.  I think the first 50 and the last 100 pages would have made the story.  There seemed to be a lot of chapters that did make certain points, but were not very relevant to the book
0684874350|5.0|This was a absolutely wonderful book.   The story never ever attempted to make you feel sorry for the family;  it is a great story about faith, endurance, and love.  It was absolutely wonderful
0553103547|5.0|A Game of Thrones has the appeal of a steamy episode of Knots Landing, the court intrigue of the English Tudors and the breadth and majesty of the Ruby Throne. This, the first volume of a new set of works by George R.R. Martin grsbs you from the prolgue to the last page. You find twists and turns in each chapter. Who are the good guys? Are they really? Who is the hero or heroine? Are they really? Does magic exist or only cold steel? Do direwolves know more than we think? Are they more than we think?<br /><br />Martin has created a world that is the grown up fantasy we have been looking for, with no easy answers and many tough solutions. A Game of Thrones makes you think, question and mutter to yourself. It frustrates you, then makes you cheer. You won't want to put it down until the next chapter makes you throw it across the room! Take this book to the beach and you'll get sunburned!
0399142851|1.0|When Patricia Cornwell first began her series of mysteries, the books were fresh, intelligent and exciting. Now the books are just dull. Plot lines are left hanging and nothing interesting ever happens. It amazes me that the newer Scarpetta books immediatley reach the bestseller lists. Everyone save your money, read the early books and  move on to a new author. Do not encourage Patricia Cornwell anymore
0812034465|5.0|I love this book.  When I was 12, I was forced to read it in school.  I hated it then.  When I was 13, I re-read it for my own pleasure - it was brilliant.  Ever since then, I have read that book 4 times.  I am now 19, and I still love that book
0312853238|5.0|This action packed sci-fi story of a young boy unknowingly responsible for the outcome of the human race can never be reduplicated by any other author again.  Card's description of space and battle become so realistic in your mind that you feel you are a part of it (this would be a great movie if any director would even atempt the special effects).  I tell you folks, it doesent get much better than this
0451169514|5.0|It by stephen king is the best book i have ever read.  The characters are developed nicely and the power and sadness of the book overwhelmes you.  This book shows the importance of friendship through tough times, and the psychological impact of emotions is overwhelming
0671004107|4.0|A really great book!  I especially like how Sagan emphises the important role of women in science, enginering and in politics, with out trying to fill some &quot;PC&quot; quota.  Even though it was probably more entertaining to see clips of Pres. Clinton in the movie, I wasn't suprised to find that the movie version conspiciously edited the part out about the President being a woman.  The book is more philosophical and makes more predictions of events that are likely to occur towards the milienium.  Really liked both the movie and the book and would highly recommend either!  Thank you Carl Sagan
0385470819|5.0|I read &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; for the first time when  was about 14. Since then I've read almost all his other books. A Time To Kill, is by far is best one yet. So many emotions are written into this book, I got angry, upset, and I cried. This book triggers emotions deep inside of us, by the end of the book, you may view society in a different light
0671004107|5.0|Forget about little green men, flying saucers, and anal-probing experiments!  Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; is the most believable science-fiction I've encountered, and by far the most enjoyable.  The political, religious and emotional arguments surrounding the construction of an extraterrestrial device are all considered in detail, leading to an emotionally-charged climax that left me wondering, &quot;What if...?&quot
0451183770|5.0|In &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Mary Shelly has created not only one of the most enduring of Gothic stories, but also a uniquely feminine tale of the horror of childbirth and its attendent responsibilities.<br /><br />While the later film versions of the story have tended to couch the telling of this story in terms of scientific over-reaching and the hubris of man who aspires to the powers of God, the original novel actually contains very little of this theme, with the famous creation scene actually occuring in one terse paragraph. There are no spark shedding electrodes or arcing bolts of electricity in Shelly's original story, only the birth of the creature, and Frankenstein's rejection of his monsterous offspring.<br /><br />It's hard to read &quot;Frankenstein&quot; without recognizing it's author as a young woman who had suffered at least one miscarriage. The entire work, although written from a masculine perspective, and set in a world of masculine domination, consistently deals with themes of parental abandonment and responsibiltity. The sin of Frankenstein in Shelly's original work is not his aspiration to godlike power over life and death, but his refusal to regard his artifical progeny with the nurturing and unconditional love any parent owes to his or her child.<br /><br /> For fans both of later cinematic retellings of this story, as well as fans of the Gothic novel and those interested in reading a true nightmare myth of feminine construction, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a true classic that cannot be reccommended highly enough.
038542471X|5.0|&quot;The Client&quot; had me enraptured from page 1 as I stood in a bookstore.  Great plot. Interesting, believable characters. And plenty of page-turning action and suspense. The movie was okay, but Grisham does such a great job with the narration of this novel that the reader can create much better images in his mind's eye from the pages of the book than anything recreated for the silver screen. I have read most of Grisham's books, and the two I haven't read I saw as films. &quot;The Client&quot; is still his second best, behind &quot;A Time To Kill.&quot; Highly recommended reading, even if you saw, or even didn't enjoy, the movie
0449227421|1.0|My very favorite line is &quot;You're saying I'm a clone&quot;, not to mention &quot;the notion of doctors experimenting on patients without permission was just the kind of  thing to make her mad&quot;. Duh!  I have always been an avid reader of Ken Follett's works, but I think he has been cloned, using the Multiplicity concept of over cloning. This book is the thriller attempt of the final clone.  Did Follett get major endorsements for this book?  We were  bombarded with commercials for cars,  clothing and  Doc Marten boots.  Why would a writer use real places and then throw in ficticious  landmarks  like the Richmond-Williamsburg airport?  This kind of constant movement from the real to the invented is very distracting from the plot.  The main character, Jeannie Ferrami, is without a doubt one of the best arguments against feminism that I have ever read.  She is completely unlikable and unsympathetic.  Her life history is inconsistent and her arrogance is unbelievable in this day and age.  I am greatly surprised that the flight attendants' union has not filed a class action suit against Follett for malice.  He uses the term &quot;stewardess&quot;  repeatedly and refers to that job as a waste of education and a classic case of failure.  This happens not just once but many times. Jeannie thoroughly believes that anyone who does not  go into the history books with a major scientific discovery is less than worthwhile.<br />This cannot be the Follett who wrote &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, please God!  I, like  another of the reviewers,  have a policy about finishing what I read.  This book was a strong test, but I just couldn't stop believing that at the end, he would say &quot;April Fool&quot;.  I would rather be tricked than believe that one of my favorite writers is  using a software program to put together a novel
0899669433|5.0|The King in Yellow is a group of thinly connected short stories all dealing with the effect of a two act play titled &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;. The play will show up in the lives and libraries of the victums as if it has a dark soul and will of its own.<br />    All that find this work are blasted in a horrific cosmic game of tag that is some of the darkest fiction in weird literature.<br />      Published in 1895 by a young art student who wrote most of it while living in Paris, the King in Yellow and the early work of Robert W.

0060920084|5.0|Other Amazon reviewers have touched on most of what I would say about this book (leaves one prone to extended periods incapacitated by laughter, brings on violent urges to read it aloud to any available form of animate life).  Bryson induces these symptoms with his ability to let us see the world through his insider/outsider perspective.  He turns the obvious over and shows us the idiocies, idiosyncracies, and illusions of everyday life.  Best of all, he takes nothing, especially not himself, too seriously, and yet doesn't lose sight of what is really important
0385486804|2.0|This is a story about the bungled life of a self-absorbed adolescent who during his twenty-four years seems to have contributed little other than causing pain to his family and friends. The author, however, who seems to be cut from the same cloth, apparently appreciates the Supertramps misadventures.  Save for the peculiar circumstances of McCandless' demise, this is an all too familiar story of the irresponsible escapades of (some of) today's youth.  The &quot;story &quot; could have been told in twenty pages. Don't waste your time
0553208845|5.0|Although at times I found myself falling asleep, I could pick up the book again and continue.  The book reminds me of the film &quot;Little Buddha,&quot; with Keanu Reeves sitting under a tree.  Siddhartha does the same.  There is more to this book than meets the eye.  We can learn footsteps of a young man growing up--leaving home, discovering wealth, love, and then being alone.  The magic of the river intrigued me with its sounds and the everlasting &quot;Om.&quot;  In the end, I found myself almost in meditation and wanting to walk to the nearest river... to listen.<br />- Mr. Lem, BDHS English 12 Teacher
0061092037|2.0|It takes some efforts to finish the book. At first I thought it is &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; with a different cover but after reading the Fourth Estate, I found it is nowhere near &quot;Kane and Abel&quot;. Disappointing
0553573403|5.0|Ever since writers started copying Tolkien, we have been offered fantasy after fantasy where the scenery and the magic are imaginative, but the people are cardboard. David Eddings has cartoons for characters; Stephen Donaldson's characters have no emotional range; Robert Jordan can't write a convincing female character to save his life, and his over-inflated series long ago lost its way. In contrast, Martin tosses off well-developed, multi-faceted characters by the handsful while maintaining a stunningly brisk pace and a fresh, carefully-structured plot. He has an unerring instinct for ending each chapter on a strong note, full of ramifications and emotional power. Each chapter is named for its viewpoint character. Whether we see the Seven Kingdoms through the eyes of a prince, a nine-year-old girl, a teen-age bastard, or a son of royal blood who happened to be born a dwarf, the narrative is convincing. If you want to visit a meaty, satisfyingly complex alternative world in a narrative that moves at double-speed through a plot of epic scale, this is the real deal. Don't miss it
0671004611|1.0|My brother wrote me a rave review of Corso's book.<br />Wanting to start reading it immediately, I ran to the local bookstore and paid list price. By the second chapter, everytime I turned a page I expected to see &quot;SUCKER&quot; as the only word on the next page.<br /><br />Obfuscation, smoke and mirrors would be my kindest description of this book.  Let me ask one question (of many). Why did they transport debris from the Roswell UFO via air (page 23), but ship<br /> via truck the alien body which Corso saw at<br /> Fort Riley? This body was enroute to Wright Field,<br /> Ohio (page29).

0345350499|5.0|If you are enthralled with the legends of King Arthur, his mystical sword Excalibur, and the magical world of Camelot, Mists of Avalon is a must-read!  From the cold, windy shores of a Scottish bluff to the Summerland of Avalon, Mists takes us on a whirlwind ride of magic, love, war, political intrigue and ancient ritual.  Most stories of Arthurian Legend focus on the men: Arthur, Uther, Lancelet, Merlin, and the Knights of the roundtable.  Marion Zimmer Bradley turns the tale on its head, delving into the hearts and minds of the women whose immense sacrifice made a united England possible.<br />With ease and skill, Bradley spins three-dimensional characters out of the pen, engaging the reader with profound intensity.  Igraine, who sacrificed her home and children for the love of Uther Pendragon; Viviane, the Lady of the Lake, whose fealty to Avalon destroyed her personal existence; Gwenhwyfar, torn between her love for Lancelet and Christian duty to Arthur; and Morgaine, fighting with her brother, Arthur to

0385311400|3.0|I had long sworn off romance novels.  One day out of boredom, I was browsing the romance section at the bookstore and picked up Outlander.  I ended up sitting on the floor to read more and then ended up buying the book.  Books Two and Three affected me the same way.   I couldn't wait to get home from work, get dinner for the family, and then sit and read more about Claire and Jamie (especially Jamie!)  My husband kept asking me what I was reading and why I was smiling so much!  The fourth book I have not even finished.  I have no interest in picking it up.  Though I wanted to see Jamie and Claire's story continue and didn't want to give the characters up, I think I'd rather go back and reread the first three books than buy books 5 and 6.  Diana Gabaldon is an extremely gifted writer, but I think she should have stopped after three.  I personally do not want to see Jamie die or read about them at 70 or 80 years of age!  As to a movie?  Given Jamie's personality and looks, there is no actor on this earth who could fill his shoes!!!!!

Unnatural Exposure as usual was researched well but there seemed to be too much missing. And Lucy, give me a break. I think the character Lucy is PC and I'm very tired of her. I'm also tired of Kay Scarpetta and Wesly Benton. Which only leaves Marino. He seems to be the only character in her books that has any sort of personality. And what about the ending. Were the publishers pushing her to finish? I thought it was slapped together. I had to go back through the pages to figure out who the killer was.  I guess we know what will be in the next book, the continuing saga of poor Lucy and her continual screwups. And please Kay Scarpetta find another boyfriend, one with a personality
0316926345|4.0|Evelyn Waugh's didactic Catholicism intrudes on this otherwise sparkling depiction of the decline of the British aristocracy.   Known more for his bitterly funny satires of British 20th-century life, Waugh here weaves only snippets of humor into a broader emotional palette, building a tale that moves from the sophisticated sarcasm of the university to the mourning of a trouble clan ultimately cursed by fortune.     Brideshead Revisited reminds us that as a prose stylist, Waugh had few equals. His multi-faceted and strikingly human depictions of the Brideshead inhabitants, his facility with language, his stately compression; few writers can claim to have so often struck upon le mot juste. Yet his central theme of spiritual awakening never stabilizes into a coherent whole; In the end, narrator Ryder's mood is ambivalent (as is the reader's), while the broken Marchmain clan swoons into a somewhat banal parade of rediscovered, yet damaged, Catholicism.    In his letters, critic Edmund Wilson pointed to Brideshea
0679457313|5.0|This is a slim volume that should be savoured slowly. Roy is a poet with a stunning use of metaphor that helps delineate character and set a mood.  This is neither a beach book nor a book for those who prefer their stories straightfoward and their characters neatly drawn.  In fact, this is not a traditional novel at all, but rather  Roy's depiction of India can be compared to an impressionist painting: one that allows the viewer  to be drawn in by the mood of the canvas and then left to make his or her own impressions
0671683888|5.0|This book began my love for the writing of Ira Levin.  It is so stylish and damnably clever and holds up perfectly, these many years later.  I have given this book to several people recently and they all have been amazed by it.  So deftly plotted, the writing so assured.  And even though the plot device has been ripped off ad nauseum by many lesser talents, this book still packs a helluva wallop.  Bravo
0553260111|4.0|I only dock it down to an 8 because it can be hard to follow at times.  This is by no means a &quot;light read&quot; - this is what you read if you want to spend some free time being the James Bond From Hell, In Hell.  Actually, Bourne is better than Bond - more believable.  Far more.  And more complex.  You will get sucked in, you will have trouble putting this book down, and you will learn how to do some of the shadier things in life - like hide in plain sight.<BR> <br /> If you get stuck somewhere in the book, don't worry - just take a deep breath (you've probably been holding your breath, waiting for what happens next), and re-read the paragraph or page that lost you.<BR>  <br />  Once you've finished the book, give it some time to sink in, then read it again - you'll find something new you missed last time.
0380973634|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book, both for its form and its substance.  I had never heard of Gaiman, but picked up the book while browsing at a local bookseller. (Publishers take note - its prominent placement at the store and its attractive cover caused me to pick the book up and read the first few pages.  Intriqued, I purchased the book.)      The idea of a dark underworld co-existing with our own - yet generally invisible to the casual or well-heeled inhabitant of this world- works on a couple of lvels. It works as a literary device which allows us to examine the dark side of our own existence, yet without being challenged directly. It also works as a statement, albeit understated and perhaps unintended,    of the real subterranean existence of many of us.  (As a native New Yorker, there is a relatively large group of people living in abandoned subway tunnels, etc. who generally pass through this life either unobserved or ignored by us mere commuters)         Although, many have compared Gaiman's work to Douglas Adams.  I thought a comparison could be made to Jack Finney, author of Time and Again and other novels (I believe he also did Night of the Living Dead) and stories which involved time and space. If you liked Gaiman - I think you would like Finney.        Finally, after reading this book, I &quot;surfed the net&quot; and discovered that this had been a t.v. serial.  I saw pictures of the cast.  It was not what I had imagined when I read the book and created my own mental images of the characters.  I wonder whether or how my impressions of the book would have changed if I had these visions implanted for me (as happened with Hitchhikers Guide).
0671004107|4.0|First, since most readers who pick up the novel &quot;Contact&quot; will be comparing it with the movie &quot;Contact&quot;based upon this, Carl Sagan's stiff legged sci-fi romp, let us release the good news. Carl Sagan really DOES know how to treat a woman! Far from conveniently dead in the &quot;shades of Disney syndrome&quot; (see film version) our heroine Eleanor Arroways's mother is alive and communicative  throughout most of &quot;Contact&quot;, providing her brilliant daughter with lots of pricks of conscience and many a petty annoyance. (Plus a next to the last page revelation that  is both juicy and confusing.)  Not only that, but Sagan 's U.S. President for the 'nineties is a political dynamo who happens to be female.  The book therefore achieves a balance between the sexes missing up on the big screen. Sadly, Sagan is not gifted  with the writing abillity to truly lead us into astronomer Arroway's world, so much of the book reads like a giant footnote--information we receive to help us catch up. I don't mean to quibble. I'm grateful Carl Sagan wrote &quot;Contact&quot;. It is, after all,  430 pages of a really fun idea - the whole world works together  and five people get to see God tip his hand. Now, where do I go to post my movie review
0679442790|5.0|It is so rare that I come away from a book almost in a state of speechlessness. The Reader is that rare kind of book.One wants to just sit quietly and meditate on the experience. If you should decide tom read the book, I urge you not to read the dust jacket. Flow with the experience without know what is going to occur. It will add to the magic of this extroadinary book.From memory, it is the story of a 14 year old boy who through circumstances to lengthy to go into has an affair with a 36 years old, of all things, a street car conductor, in Germany. The story twists and turns until one day for no apparent reason, the woman dissappears. Years go by. The boy grows up and we are introduced to the  womans background.She is brought up on horrendous charges which I don't want to go into, for the reader's sake, and there is a trial.The book gets it's name from the fact that when she was having her affair with the boy she has him read to her.Read it. Savor it. The author of all things is a prize winning detective story writer in Germany. This book is an experience that makes reading such a joy
068484267X|4.0|This is a wonderful Irish book.  Irish, meaning, relying on a rhythmic, lilting recounting which belies the tragic substrate of the plot, the eternal Irish irony.  One line, describing a visit from the doctor during his confinement with typhoid fever is worth the price of the hardcover      &quot; He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.&quot;
0451160916|5.0|THIS HAS GOT TO BE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK BY STEPHEN KING.  HE DEFINITELY KNOWS HOW TO SCARE, THE MAN MUST EITHER BE CRAZY, OR A GENIUS.  I PICK BOTH.  THE SIX HOUR MINI SERIES WAS TRUE TO THE BOOK, MORE SO THAN THE ORIGINAL FILM, BUT THIS BOOK KEPT ME AWAKE NIGHTS.  I DON'T READ HIM AT NIGHT ANYMORE
0385472951|4.0|I loved this book all the way through, until the very end. You had to admire the cunningness of the main character and his ability to &quot;disappear.&quot; After looking at a couple other on-line reviews, I was glad to see I wasn't, however, the only one left &quot;annoyed and irritated&quot; by the ending. There is NO basis for it! It comes so far out of left field, that even looking back with it in mind, it cannot be supported. There's too many characters to get to know any of them very well, and some just drop out of the picture altogether. The story itself is engrossing, and pulls the reader forward and a rapid pace, but the ending...Oh John, WHY
0451169514|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I started to read this book on the night of Nov. 14, 1988.  I read the first few pages while I was waiting to have my baby.  I got to the part when the clown pulled Georgie into the sewer, and told my mother to take it home.  I didn't pick it up again until almost a  year later, and two days later, I finished it.  I couldn't go to sleep with the lights off for a week afterwards, I was sixteen years old.  I found it was very scary for the most part, but found the part about the giant spider was a dissapointment
0553573403|4.0|I liked this book. It has complex and varying characters with varying viewpoints. It offers brutal but honest depictions of a medieval setting with fewer moral hangups than we enjoy today. Most importanly, it has surprising plot twists: the good guys don't always win.<br /><br />However, some characters are unconvincing. A princess, who has been terrorized by her brother and only relative and companion all her life, suddenly turns into a fearless woman who can manipulate her husband and events around her like she had never done anything else. A 14 year old boy, who has never before led a battle or fought in one, suddenly outwits a highly experienced general in large scale military maneuvers. Despite this, the book is entertaining.<br /><br /> But such good beginnings present one serious danger: you may want to read the sequels. As Jordan has shown, this can be a pain to do if the flow of sequels never ceases. I believe this book can carry two good sequels, or with a lot of effort, three. But who knows how many Martin has planned?
044651506X|5.0|Did you notice that out of all the reviews here, they were either very good or very bad?  I don't know about all the &quot;very bads,&quot; but I find everything from Nelson DeMille to be either very good or simply great! I'd say this one lies in the very good category. Even saying that, there were a combination of elements in Plum Island that are rarely found elsewhere.  - Love story that stays with you long after you're done reading. - The feeling of being transported to the setting of Long Island and feeling the pain and happiness of the main character. - I felt like I spent a week on the North Fork of Long Island. I can't wait to actually visit and see what DeMille described. - Last but not least, DeMille creates books that you can't put down.  Ah, to have that talent. Great work Nelson
0553103547|5.0|All I can say is that this is the best new<br /><br />book of the year.  Now that its out in paperback,<br />there is absolutely no reason not to read it.<br /> This book is as good or better than anything<br />Robert Jordan has written, which is saying A LOT!<br />  If you only buy one book this year,<br />this is it.
0192815792|3.0|&quot;The Moonstone&quot; is commonly considered to be the beginning of the genre we call Detective Fiction.  It was written on a bet with Robert Lewis Stevenson.  Collins wagered that he could write a story at least half as good as Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island.&quot;  For my money, he succeeded, and then some.  It is an old-style book, distinctly the product of the 19th Century.  In the style of many 19th Century novels, it is narrated by several different characters, which may take the modern reader a bit of getting used to.  But the plot is clever, punctuated by the unexpected just at the moment when it seems the whole thing might resolved itself quite quickly.  It's fun, and it's a fascinating look into another time
0451169514|5.0|Ohne groe Worte zu verlieren: ES gehrt mit Abstand zu den besten Bchern die ich jemals gelesen habe (und ich habe wirklich viele gelesen). Die Story, die Charactere, das Umfeld - man taucht ein und mchte nicht mehr hochkommen
0345403959|2.0|This book is, unfortunately, mostly just a rehash of plot elements previously mentioned in Eddings' previous books.  While there are a few new events  here and there, the fact that the overall plot  is already somewhat obvious makes it tedious to   read.  This books was hugely disappointing after  all the other excellent and captivating books  by Eddings.  It is almost as if it was written by  someone else.
0679443819|5.0|I particularly liked the author's talent for making history come alive.   His characters are real &amp; bring the events to life.   I believed that these things happened because of the characters.  Also, I enjoyed reading about the origins of many of the customers, words and traditions we now have.    FOR EXMAPLE:  Wedding cakes.
0440117658|5.0|Whether it is the average human individual who should not be allowed to possess a gun, or nations of humans who should not be allowed to possess nuclear weapons, Kurt Vonnegut champions the theme that man is too immature a beast too handle technology.  In Deadeye Dick he is more successful in developing this theme than in the more famous Cat's Cradle, perhaps because Deadeye Dick is more serious.  Unfortunately Vonnegut doesn't brook the question: Who is to deny humans the power they know how to create?  He leaves no solution and if there is none, Deadeye Dick stands as a lament over hopeless humanity

0553573403|5.0|This is one of the most engaging fantasy novels I have ever read. What makes it stand out in my eyes is how it is not sugar-coated. Regrettably many fantasy novels do not have the realistic clarity that they should in fantasy settings. However, this novel has such things. Robert Jordan's epics are not nearly as convincing as this novel; there are illegitamate offspring, family feuds, political alliances that change on a whim, as well as murder and betrayal for self enhancement are very common throughout the novel. The characters are very detailed and Martin convincingly narrates each with an independant voice that is unique to that individual. Also Martin's sense of time though in the begining I thought was chronological on a day by day basis, is not. In fact there may be a period of two months between chapters so he spares you every single detailed minutae of their lives which can be pretty boring and wordy. For lack of better words it's like Melrose Place combined with The Wheel Of Time series by Robert
0399142851|3.0|After taking a one-book break from fiction's favorite Medical Examiner, Patricia Cornwell returns Kay Scarpetta to us in UNNATURAL EXPOSURE.  Despite the often gruesome circumstance of the Scarpetta series, they are always a fast and fun read.  Cornwell's latest is no exception.<br /><br />This time, an outbreak of a never-before seen pox virus infects some people on an island located off the Virginia coast.  Even the remaining torso of a  horribly mutilated homicide victim in Kay's morgue shows signs of having had the disease.  Dr. Scarpetta, her overweight, irascible police investor friend Marino, and FBI agent niece Lucy are baffled. Where did this disease come from?  Will the outbreak call for a national emergency?  How can a cure be found if no one knows exactly what the disease is?  Why was the murder victim chopped to bits if she was going to die of this horrible illness anyway?  In true Cornwellesque fashion, these questions are answered with broad hints along the way.  After reading some truly depressing novels in recent weeks, UNNATURAL EXPOSURE came as a pleasant diversion
0380973634|5.0|There's a certain kind of story that I'm a sucker for, the story of average people with average lives getting sucked into a world of magic and the supernatural.  Its the subject of many bad movies on cable tv late at night, but when its done well it can't be beat for entertainment value. <br /> Neil Gaiman has been a favorite of mine since I discovered &quot;The Sandman&quot; several years ago, so I jumped at this novel as soon as I saw it.  The premise of this book is not terribly original, it combines elements of Tim Powers' &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot;, Christopher Fowler's &quot;Roofworld&quot; and many a classic quest novel (there are repeated references to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; among other things), but the execution is deeply satisfying.   <br />  Gaiman makes it seem so effortless, its not until you've finished the book that you realize what a great story he has pulled off.  I particularly liked the concept of Earl's Court as a travelling subway car, invisible to the up-worlders going about their business on the same train.  <br />  But what really makes this novel work is the characters, the hapless hero Richard, young Door, the mysterious marquis and Hunter, and two of the most unforgettable villains you will ever meet.  I cared what happened to them all.  I hope Gaiman will return to this world in future novels, as Robert Holdstock did with &quot;Mythago Wood&quot; (also highly recommended).

1568953968|5.0|Frank McCort has given us an amazing account of his less than idyllic childhood as a member of the poorest of the poor growing up in Limerick Ireland.  The affects of an alcoholic father, unable to provide anything outside a drunken song and the appetite for a good story, as well as the Catholic Church with its shortcomings and failure to recognize the good in its poorest faithful members will bring you to tears.  Frank's was a childhood filled with loss, disappointment and feelings of shame.  Its a wonder such a beginning could be penned into this touching memoir.  I shall always cherish this book
044651506X|5.0|I loved the book.  DeMille should start a series of John Corey novels
0451452739|5.0|Space Odyssey is a well-told, space-age tale, with intriguing views about evolution, life and the stars.  The book turned out to be much better and different than I expected!  If a book's value is judged by how hard it is to put down, then this one is definitely a must-buy, especially if you like SF.
1859849296|5.0|For anyone who has ever doubted the claims of big religion or aggrandized holy personalities, this book will be a personal vindication. Despite the title, Mr. Hitchens refrains from cheap shots and focusses on the scary facts; the millions of dollars squirrelled away in Catholic Church bank accounts, S&amp;L loan scandal money hoarded by Mother Theresa, and amazing stories of the mobster nun hobnobbing with the rich and famous fascist set in Haiti and around the world, while children died in her &quot;hospices&quot; without aspirin or medical attention. A must read that was regarded, incorrectly, as tacky or cruel by the majority of the press
0441003257|5.0|As a fan of Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; and Gaimen's &quot;Sandman,&quot; I  had high hopes and expectation for &quot;Good Omens,&quot; and I was not disappointed.   The book is darkly hilarious, with both authors' respective styles clearly evident.  Also in ample supply are excellent character development and an engaging story, which are also to be expected from a tale written by these two master storytellers.  The contemporary forms into which angel, demon, and horsemen of the Apocalypse have evolved reflect humanity's own bizarre advances (decline?).  It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much.  I would heartily recommend it to anyone with a slightly dark sense of humor - anyone without one probably wouldn't read a book about the Apocalypse anyway
1563523302|3.0|This is a best seller?  This books reads like a college thesis, and although it has a few good points, I think they could have been made in a short article. My favorite part is the appendix, where the author's included their chart of automobiles by the cost per pound.  Do millionaire really buy cars by the pound? Would not a used cement truck prove to be a good investment?  A silly little book with a good point or two that the public eats up- I was one of them since I bought the book.
0684874350|5.0|I saw so much of my own family in this book.  The attitudes of the older generations are still the same.  This book brought back wonderful memories for me and at the same time it was very disturbing.  Unfortunately much of the discrimination still takes place in Ireland, especially in the North.  It's about time Ireland had a voice, and who better to speak for an impoverished country than Frankie McCourt
0517702967|1.0|its always an enormous disappointment to be let down badly by one of one's favorite authors...and let down i was ..to the point of incredulity..as pages turned i kept looking for the excellence i had come to expect from mr. follet..no luck..no such luck..and when all the cliches had been fully exploited, the so called 'plot' resolved..i was thrilled ...only in that i'd arrived at the final page..i hate to say it ,but i will be hesitant to buy his next work of fiction.
0385311400|3.0|The first book of Diana Galbaldon I read was Dragonfly in Amber.  What a great story.  I then went back and read Outlander.  I could hardly wait for Voyager and eagerly anticipated Drums of Autumn.  The first two books held me spellbound for hours.  I would read before going to sleep, dream of Jamie and Claire, and arise early to begin the drama again.  Diana Gabaldon has the ability to draw her readers into the story and bring characters to live.  Voyager was not as great as the first two books and Drums of Autumn was a disappointment.  The story of Briana and Roger was great to explore - could have been been more in depth.  I believe it would have been in better sequence to develop their lives in the past without the complication of Jamie and Claire.  Afterall, they are very dynamic characters and overshadow all present.  At the end, the two groups could meet which would lead into the 5th book of the series.  Fergus which was so prevelent in the last two books was only mildly mentioned in this book.  It was a bit disjointed.  Hopefully, the 5th book of the series will be a while in coming and allow Ms Gabaldon the opportunity to layout the book in her normal fashion.  Don't be in a hurry to &quot;Get another book on the market.&quot;  Good things come to those that wait
0451169514|5.0|I didn't know what a good book was until I read Stephen King's 'It'.  I started it when I was 14 years old, thinking &quot;No way will I ever finish this, it's just too long.&quot;  Well, what can I say?  I suprised myself.  I became completely involved in the lives of each and every character in the book.  The seven kids meant something to me.  I actually cared about them.  It was also really easy for me to relate to since it was not that long ago that I had been their age.  I could not put this book down.  I read it from cover to cover.  Stephen King has the ability to put several characters in a book and make them each so unique and different and special that you can easily keep track of them.  Few authors can do this.  Most books that have many different characters are confusing to read because you get them mixed up.  The reason that I gave this book a 9 instead of a 10 is because toward the end, it gets kind of confusing when It is in war with the Turtle.  You never really understand what the Turtle is.  And also, I wasn't crazy about the idea of It actually being just one big spider.  Other than that, this book was great.  Undoubtedly one of the best books I ever read.  I would recommend it to anyone
0684874350|5.0|One of my favorite books is &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.&quot;  One of my favorite authors is Mark Twain. To my mind, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; had some of the best elements of  both.  Like &quot;Tree,&quot;  it tells the story of a family struggling with poverty brought about by the father's problems with alcohol. Like Twain, McCourt tells his story through the eyes of an adolescent.  And he captures a youngster's point of view in an extremely credible way.  In spite of the harrowing story he has to tell, this device allows real and moving humor to brighten the story
067942850X|5.0|I happen to think that Krakauer has a wonderful writing style evidenced in this and in Into Thin Air.  I am only surprised at 2 comments which showed up in some of the negative reviews.  First is that, at a modest 207 pages, the book could have been shorter!  I thought it was by no means too short and everything that was in the book added to the whole.  Second, I sensed that some people felt that experiences like Chris' are so commonplace that they're hardly worth mentioning.  If so, I haven't read a whole lot of accounts like this one. I would unreservedly recommend this book to anyone
185984054X|5.0|Bravo to Christopher Hitchens for writing a story that needed to be told.  Too bad Mother Teresa's many supporters and apologists will probably never read this book.  This book's a must for anyone who's concerned about instant myths-in-the-making
0393314804|5.0|I just got done reading the book &amp; it is now one of my favorites.  Along with Jack Kerouac's &quot;On the Road,&quot; this book is a search for your place in life &amp; the friends that travel with you.  If you ever wanted to open a window to the thoughts, ideas &amp; dilemmas of an idealistic junky then this is the book for you.  It also opens up the world of today's youth. Very entertaining
0380730405|5.0|I was hooked from the first sentence. Literally. I flipped it open to see what it was all about, and from then on I was lost, empathizing with the insecure young girl who tells the story. I lived with her in what seemed a fairytale dream that turned into a rending nightmare. I shivered at things that normally wouldn't scare me, but, with strained nerves, became hair-raising.<br /><br /> Ms. du Maurier has written one of the best Gothic novels of all time. Every sentence builds to a sudden ending that makes you think that there must be more. But you have to supply it yourself.<br /><br /> I, too, dreamed of Manderly last night...

0399142851|2.0|Thank goodness I'm not the only one becoming disillusioned with Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta character.  As oftentimes happens, her first novels were much better than the last several published.  Are they just being turned out for their dollar return.  Unnatural Exposure reached midpoint in the book before it gained any interest for me.  The story line is so unbelievable it makes one wonder that we should reclassify Cornwell's tales as Sci-Fi.  The ending was just as anticlimatic as the entire book.  Bring back the interesting, thought-provoking tales of years gone by.  The only interesting character remaining is Det. Marino
0679457313|5.0|This writer has a great style and a wonderful sense of atmosphere - and construction. It is simply stated, a novel full of sense of place and of history. There are, perhaps, too many linguistic flurries which could have been edited more fully - but that aside the novel is a powerful read and could make a wonderful film
0385472951|3.0|Where is the John Grisham we all know and love?  The Partner's watery plot and weak characters are shameful  in comparison to three of the finest novels I've ever read:  A Time to Kill, The Firm, and The Pelican Brief.  In contrast, The Partner meanders through the story of a selfish, crafty man who justifies even his most extreme actions (corpse mutilation?)<br />even when they are ridiculous.<br /><br />  The most interesting, and sadly, the least successful component of the book is the ending....  Grisham takes what could have been a highly successful ending and ruins it with sloppy, rushed writing.  Did his hand get tired during the last page and a half?  For that's what the reader is left with: a mere handful of paragraphs for Patrick's entire journey, 366 pages long, to utterly disintegrate.<br /><br />  In order to return to the quality of his former titles, I think Mr. Grisham  should slow down a little.  I know he wants to churn out these million-dollar bestsellers ASAP (who wouldn't?) but a day more here, a day longer there, and perhaps his readers wouldn't feel that they sailed around the world only to sink in the final port of call,  which is exactly how I felt after the last page of The Partner
0606118667|5.0|The second book in Card's masterpiece Ender Saga. This series is one of the best series' in the world as of now, and this is coming from a reader-- not a ignoramus.

0679758976|2.0|I've read a lot of books, good and bad, and this is one of them.  Mr. Follett should take his money and run.  Because I hate to leave a book unfinished once started, I won't burden myself with starting any new efforts by him
0880389052|5.0|Like the literature produced by Tolkien, it is almost impossible to do this book enough justice. Sedition, matriarchal violence, blood sacrifice, demonic worship, fratricide, avarice...this is only a fraction of what the book entails. It is so deliciously malicious, that it is worth chewing every mouthful an infinite number of times before letting it lodge in the stomach. The overpowering sense of desperation experienced by the book's main character, Drizzt, is in perfect equilibrium with the contrasting desperation of his fanatical mother, Malice. The character descriptions are near perfect.....feed on their hatred! The one-line summary at the top applies to both the drow race, and to you. FARAZ KERMANI
0671004107|5.0|If you had one Carl Sagan book to read, this  would probably be it.  It reads as if it were  a &quot;Best of Sagan&quot; containing many of his    non-fiction themes in a science fiction setting.   Emphasis should be placed upon the &quot;science&quot;   in the &quot;science fiction&quot;.  While it may contain   technobabble, it's believable technobabble   because so much of it is based upon Sagan's   real-life work.   <br />   All of his favorites are here: the dodecahedron,   the SETI project, commentary on superpower mistrust,   who speaks for the Earth, and the conflict between   religious and scientific belief systems.   It does get a bit heavyhanded with the recurring   thread about the persecution of astronomers   who are so much smarter than everyone else   (another Sagan favorite).   <br />   I enjoyed the fact that Ellie Arroway was figuring   out the problems of the universe, but could not   resolve her own family problems.
0553573403|5.0|This has got to be the best book that I have read in my entire life.  I encourage anyone who is looking for a good fantasy novel to read this book.

And I just have to say that I think Sandor Clegane is the man.  Anyway, read this book

0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashes is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  When I read this book, I felt like I was reading a book about some of my relatives.  McCourt's mix of humor and complete despair really exemplifies not only the Irish spirit, but human spirit as well.  To tell the story from a child's point of view creates a pathos which at time had me laughing and at times had me in tears.  This is a must read for anyone who grew up with an Irish or Irish Catholic background
0671004107|3.0|I found Sagan's fictional work interesting from the standpoint of it's scientific base. I enjoyed learning about MESA and the search for  audio contact from others in the universe. The characters  were believable, and the weaving of the social,  political. and economic implications were thought  provoking.  I can't say it was a page turner, but I managed to turn them all.
0380973634|4.0|I found myself turning the pages but being disappointed at the lack of depth. The characters are just that-characters and not &quot;living&quot; people.  It is a good read and I loved the concept.  If you like to stay on the surface of things-read it
0553502077|2.0|I think that John Grisham must be getting tired - this book is the most boring one  and I have read all of his novels - I  kept waiting for it to get interesting and it never happened. The only thing I learned was how to move money around the world - that is if I ever get any money to move around the world! The characters were never developed and the final thought on this one was &quot;who cares&quot;
1856957071|4.0|Red Harvest by Dashiell Hammett, is a tense, fast-paced well written tale of Hammett's hero, The Continental OP, cleaning up a criminal-ridden town by setting all the various factions againts each other. I enjoyed this novel, though I prefer Raymond Chandler's style to Hammett's. Hammett's is a little more sparse. However, if you searching for a good introduction to the genre, here's a good place to start.  Trivia note: This novel has inspred three movies (none credited the book as inspiration). Toshiro Mifune as a samurai in YOJIMBO; Clint Eastwood as the man with No Name in FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and more recently, Bruce Willis in LAST MAN STANDING.

And also, I'm always looking to talk to other Carson experts so email if you are.  thank
0899668380|5.0|In I Am Legend, Matheson has spun the most original take on the vampire myth that I have ever read.  It features Vampires not only as predators but as victims as well.  Packed with tension and knowledge, I Am Legend is truly one of the most satisfying books in my library.  A page turner that will keep you in your seat reading, but still short enough to allow you to go to work in the morning
0140072187|5.0|Bob Mason's writing style is both personal and personable. His tale of using his rotor blades to chop his way down to a microscopic LZ is frightening but rings true. The heroism of the chopper pilots is legendary and Mason must have been one of the best. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the war in 'Nam
0802130208|5.0|When is the last time a book made you laugh out loud? Has one ever? Don't read this on a train, plane, or bus, unless you don't mind people looking at you, startled and suspicious, as you snigger and snort all by your lonesome. A truly amazing work. And the tragedy. Oh! The tragedy! We should weep for the loss of John Kennedy Toole
0446364495|1.0|Not the worst book I've ever read, but certainly one of the most disappointing!  I'm crazy about a good love story, but this one wasn't it!  I thought the book looked great, people had told me it was a great love story, I was set for a good read.  What a let down!  It wasn't particularly well written and the story was silly, yet took itself so seriously.  To take a trite little story and treat it like it was the most profound thing since Socrates-- PLEASE! (One thing in its favor-- at least it was short!
0679452729|1.0|I recently read this book and was convinced that I will never read another &quot;best seller&quot; without researching a few reviews.  I had enjoyed this author's previous work &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; but I can hardly believe he put his name to this title.    The plot is nearly comatose and the characters totally unbelievable.  The author tries to write from a woman's point of view but seems to demonstrate his fixation with womens garments and sex fantasies.  The author I think was trying to cash in on the science-thriller genre but his novel displays little serious research into the subject of cloning.    Save your money and rent a B-movie and you will bet more satisfaction
0684874350|5.0|I loved this book--the only thing I recommend besides buying and reading it is picking up an Irish folk songs CD too; hearing the proud strains of &quot;Roddy McCorley&quot; as Malachy Sr. stumbles home after drinking the dole money completes the scene
0679442790|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful.. A little heavy on the philosophizing at times, and someimes I wondered about the faithfulness of the translation, but I would recommend it to anyone.  The twists and turns in the plot truly took me by surprise, and it was a good thing that I hadn't read either the dust jacket or the reviews that give away the first half of the book

0399142851|4.0|I enjoy almost anything Cornwell writes, but my complaint is this: at the end of a novel, it's as though she suddenly decides, &quot;Hey, I have to finish this!&quot; then BOOM! it's over &amp; I'm left feeling as though I missed something.  I think this novel is the epitome of this writing syle.  Maybe had I paid more attention to the story line, I would realize &quot;who-done-it&quot; but I got wrapped up in the personal lives of the characters and forgot I was reading a mystery.  I think this is her attempt to bring back Kay Scarpetta after fans were angered at her departure in &quot;Hornets Nest&quot;. As someone from Richmond, I enjoy reading her novels to follow Kay throughout Richmond.  This is a good start at returning to Kay, but am left wanting more books like the early ones!
0061092037|4.0|Archer creates two very different, yet equally intriguing media moguls in the making. Rarely have I encountered such detailed and involving character development.

0451526384|5.0|Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century. Austen was always demure but she had claws and her books are much more about sex than most of her contemporaries' work. (The act itself, of course, is never mentioned).  Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance, which burned brightly when the two protagonists were younger, and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but, unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's, these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen, if these people were real, afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice: how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and, in Persuasion: how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own dysfunctional family? No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.)  One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique are her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).  One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this \\"critique of the family\\" more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines: she is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.  We know, by reading any of Jane Austen's books, of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows:    \\"(Anne and Cpt Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\"    That might seem sardonic enough, but here's the clincher!    \\"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which... taste cannot tolerate - which ridicule will seize.\\"    Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be: intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read: it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight.
0449227421|5.0|This is the first book I have read written by Ken Follett.  I was vacationing in Norway, and it was number one on the list there so I thought I would try it!  I could not put it down.  It kept my attention throughout! It is a novel of numerous twists, turns and surprises.  One that I could not put down--and one that I have recommended to others.  They enjoyed it just as much as I did!  Superb!
0399142851|1.0|Particia Cornwell's previous books touched upon my favorite topic, forenics.  This last book, Unnatural Exposure was a great let down.Too much time was skipped with little explaination and important moments, such as the experiment with virtual reality went away, never to be mentioned again.  The book was printed with a large amount of space between the lines and, all in all, I felt as if I have read a quickly written short story that missed hanging together with the suspense of the previous books.    No stars for this one.
0385486804|4.0|Jon has, in this instance made a pretty much successful attempt at deducing and analyzing the events that led to the death of Chris McCandless. However, the information collected is not entirely persuasive, and the reader will often be led into wondering if such an event actually took place. It may be hard to convince the reader regarding certain aspects of the deduction, especially with such a weak argument and insufficient evidences.    However, this is a commendable effort as at times, it brought out the fears and uncertainties of McCandless, making many of us being able to identify with his insecurities and passion to &quot;go into the wild&quot;. Perhaps it will take some people of certain irrationality to truly comprehend what McCandless might be thinking about. This is another obstacle for the author as he had some difficulty in making readers accept his perception of what really happened.    One thing to note is that the author often strays too far from the story and instead of reading about one person, we seemed to have read through all the biographies of other people, including himself. This should not be encouraged as it draws away the attention that ought to be focused on the main storyline. Hence, it gave the reader a feeling that the story is scattered and disorganised. And the sequence of events are often jumbled up and unclarified, leaving a feeling of dissatisfaction after the read. Still, the book is unable to shed any light as to what really happened to Chris McCandless.
0393314804|5.0|How can self-abuse, masochism, obsession and addiction be related in such a way as to be a totally compelling read?  If it is written by Irvin Welsh it is all of the above.  This novel thrilled yet sickened me and in the darker recesses of my mind I wished I could experience what these &quot;victims&quot; went through.   Welsh's characters are wholly authentic, pathetic and pitiable individuals.  The authenticity is heightened due to the novel being written in dialect.  This is not a book to be skim-read; it requires concentration and a strong stomach.
044651652X|5.0|This love story captures the true essence of living for the moments and cherishing the memories. As you read this novel you live and relive the feelings of love by commitment and love by anticipation. It affirms the reality of loving two men who fulfilled entirely different needs, without negating either relationship. And it was  all by chance....  You must read this book...It is my absolute favorite!
1573225517|5.0|As a woman, I enjoyed reading the other reviews of this book by male readers but felt that my gender was under represented. I thought it was a fantastic read. I found the character's insights and humor to be at once familiar and reassuring. This would be a great book for men and women to discuss together. Self-depricating humor but not without empathy. I learned alot and laughed even more. I would recommend this book heartily to many different people.
1559948671|5.0|The book is expertly written by one who was on the ground and lived through it.  The book carries with it many stories about those brave soldiers who lived and died in the Valley.  It is a very emotional book and one worth reading.  I viewed the Valley from a Helicopter Gun Ship.
0679442790|4.0|This is not an easy book to read and some may even think it's depressing. One might glibly describe it as another 'rite of passage book' or toss off Hanna as a 'German Mrs. Robinson'.  But to dismiss either as such is to be facetious.  What this book does is to make one think of one's own prejudices; to reconsider youth's idealism and how  this sometimes turns into unintended cruelties. It questions the notions of love and forgiveness, of loyalty and betrayal.  The prose is poetic without being mawkish; there is pathos but no bathos!  This is a quiet little book that echoes and reverberates in ones mind long after one has closed its covers.
0517591812|5.0|Mr. Rutherford is a wonderful time traveler, taking us through 2,000 years of history.  His characters leap off the pages and fill my imagination.

0151001820|4.0|I don't like mysteries much, but for any bibliophile, this intellectual thriller--so deftly rendered that you'll forget it's a translation--keeps a lively plot, a disreputable but acerbically engaging protagonist, and some moving descriptions of both the love of books and the plights of those trapped by desires textual and otherwise rapidly moving towards a fitting climax.  Couldn't help but wonder if there will be a sequel, given the ending scene.  It's slow in the beginning, but picks up once Corso's pursuit takes him into the haunts of other collectors of rare and diabolical tomes.  I found myself skimming the Dumas descriptions, and never became engaged by the swashbuckling genre as presented here, but the Eco-like investigation into the demonological world provided for me the book's real pleasure.  And a lust for books energizes this enjoyable intellectual chase.
0380973634|5.0|After I read this book I began to worship Neil Gaiman. I carved a little statue of him out of a elephant's tusk and step up an altar for the man that should rule the world. I have read &quot;Neverwhere&quot; thirteen times since I got it last month and it is the greatest. Neil Gaiman is my hero. I want to go up to be just like him. If I every met Nail Gaiman I would get down on my knees and start kissing the ground that he walks up, for it IS SURELY BLESSED!! And for all of you that think I have been reading Neil Gaiman since he came out with Sandman, I will prove you wrong. &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is the only thing I have read from him. I haven't even read Sandman or Good Omens. &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is the greatest book of all time.
0893815187|4.0|Overall I liked her book, most of her photographs were excellent. The few that were not of the high quality I expected were more than overridden by the outstanding pictures like &quot;Jessie at 6, 1988&quot;, &quot;Emmett 1985&quot;, and especially &quot;Emmett, Jessie, and Virginia, 1989&quot;, and &quot;The Last Time Emmett Modeled Nude, 1987&quot;.

An excellently written account of mescalin use as well as a philosophical argument as to what religion and reality are really all about.

0787105465|1.0|This book was passed around quickly and eagerly between the women in my workplace, and praised by most as &quot;One of the best books ever written&quot;. When it was my turn, it was handed to me reverentially. Yes, it kept me up most of the night! But not reading -- I persisted through 30 pages or so, only because I cared about the friends who had recommended it so highly -- rather, I stayed awake for a long time trying to figure out what to tell my buddies. I wanted to say that it was sappy, that it reeked of a Mad magazine parody, that it was probably written by a college student as a thesis on the gullibility and poor taste of the American book-buying public -- but how to say that without insulting my friends?<br /> I settled for just saying that I hated it and couldn't even finish it. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it makes you reexamine the old gang! I still have respect for their opinions on things other than reading matter, but even had to rethink that one. Scary.
0060920084|5.0|Bryson sees Small town America through the eyes of an outsider having lived in England for many years. Being English and now happily living in teh US his stories seem to resonate very well with me. The description of Las Vegas with its &quot;carpets like yards of woven vomit&quot; really are wonderful. I highly recommend this hilarious book to anyone who will travel in the USA
0399142851|1.0|I'd say the first half of the book was headed down the typical Patricia Cornwell road:  Well-crafted plot details, intriguing characters, and interesting sub-plots.  After that, it was all downhill.  Several story lines were left hanging, Kay Scarpetta turned into a wimpy, whining, drag, and when I found out who the killer was, I had to flip through the rest of the book to remember who she/he was.  (The problem was, I never did figure it out!)  Patricia Cornwell has gotten too comfortable with her character and her writing, and this story is the result.  Save your money and wait for the next one!
0026009102|5.0|Do you find yourself often ridiculed by your peers for being selfish?  Do they say you don't feel enough love for your fellow man?

0061002747|5.0|The book is very interesting, and with every chapter's end you want to go on. It really makes you think and guess a lot, and the ending is very surprising. <BR> This is a MUST for detective story lovers.
0399142851|2.0|At least we were spared what has become the usual Scarpetta heroics in the end. A simple arrest that would have happened whether or not she was at the scene. <BR> <BR> The more I read Cornwell, the more I realize that, except for Marino, her characters have no substance. It's becoming more noticeable now because the plots are getting less interesting. Most of Cornwell's details pertaining to Scarpetta are about whatever food or wine she is drinking. Lucy has improved, at last. She is less petulant and moody than usual. Wesley is just as personality-less as Kay (what is the attraction between them, dullness?). <BR> <BR> I think I would find Cornwell's books more interesting if she kept Kay at the local level with only minimal dealings with the FBI. I'm sure she'd have plenty to keep her busy in Virginia instead of traipsing all over the country and interfacing with a zillion government agencies (with their zillion acronyms and abbreviations). Making her a government agent does not add to the interest of the books. It's the medical examiner work that has made the books interesting. She's at her best in her lab, not hopping military planes. <BR> <BR> I'm annoyed by the serial aspect of the book. Yes, characters do grow and I like seeing that happen, but must we re-visit criminals (especially when it's merely a teaser for upcoming books and has no relevance to the current plot) as well? <BR> <BR> I wish Cornwell would take a break from Scarpetta and not try so hard to crank out one book per year. It's apparently too much of a strain on her creativity, and I don't mean that unkindly.
0553573403|5.0|This is a wicked, wicked book.  Not only does it leave you just ITCHING for the next installment, it makes whatever book you read directly afterwards seem shallow and unfulfilling.  Martin's characterizations are profound, his plotlines are intricate, and he manages to somehow make plot twists both totally surprising and perfectly logical.<br /> At first, I was somewhat hesitant about giving this book my highest marks; it appeared to be falling into fantasy's most common pitfall.  You know what I'm talking about -- the 'good guys' in fantasy tend to be shining and pristine, and the 'bad guys' are evil in every way.  That's how it honestly looked for a while, but Martin soon pulled out of that particular nosedive.  In the end, the book was more a tale of people fighting for their conflicting goals than outright good versus outright evil.  (Other books which are exceptional in this respect are Guy Gavriel Kay's _Tigana_, where you never know who to root for, and of course Tad Williams' &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; series.)<br /> I'm tempted to advise an interested reader to wait until the series is completed before they begin on the first book, but it's just so darn good you might as well just dive right in and subject yourself to a painful wait.
0802130208|5.0|This book refers to man's real problem: the digestive system. You can't have fun or feel good in any way if your valve is blocked.

0671688782|1.0|Apparently this method was originally designed for autistic children. Not only is the purported justification of this - that autism stems from a failure in mother-child bonding - one which has been scientifically discredited since the sixties, but for many autistic people (who often have tactile hypersensitivity that makes physical contact uncomfortable if not painful) the forced holding advocated here is nothing short of torture: a form of &quot;sensory rape&quot;. <br />  All forced holding can teach ANY child is that someone on whom you are completely dependent is prepared to ignore your screaming and struggling and physically overpower you. And then call it love.
0671891634|1.0|This book can be summarized as follows: &quot;Whenever you personally observe a company to be successful or promising, go off and do fundamental research, and if the fundamentals look good, buy.&quot;  Other than that, there is no generally applicable  stock-picking advice here, just a detailed post-mortem report of Lynch's 1992 stock-picking decisions.  Imagine a book by a chess master which purports to provide winning chess-playing strategies but in fact provides just a move-by-move description of one particular chess game the author won.  Save your money for buying stocks, or buy a useful book which actually contains stock-picking strategies, e.g. How to Make Money in Stocks by William J. O'Neil.

0688002307|5.0|I regularly give copies to people that I really care about.  They have never failed to become absorbed in the quest, both the character's and their own life's.  Unfortunately, it will place you at odds with the rest of the world, especially the corporate world, where a good spreadsheet or &quot;running the numbers&quot; is all that it takes to make a go/no go decision... or to call a management failure a success.    You may, therefore, find that the main character's  descent into insanity, is not unlike the feeling you will get when you see the blank stares from friends and acquaintances when you try to explain what quality is and what it is not.  Reading this book undoubtedly changed my life.  It remains yet to be seen, however, if the patient dies.
0380002930|5.0|This book is truly amazing. The story is so moving and so completely real that I find it hard to believe that rabbits do not really live in the &quot;Watership Down&quot; world. I have read it an uncountable number of times, and I still get chills reading the last few chapters. My first copy is so ragged that if I read it again it would fall apart, so I lovingly retired it to an honored spot on my bookshelf and got another copy to continue reading it every year or so. Someday, I'm sure, I will have a shelfful of these old copies of Watership Down...I would and do recommend it to everyone. Do you know that I started reading it to two kids I babysat for who never did anything but watch cable and play videogames, and they were so mesmerized that from then on that was what they wanted me to do whenever I was over there? Truly a magical experience to read and to hear...

0151001820|4.0|The author, Arturo Perez-Reverte, certainly has his facts straight about Alexandre Dumas.  He also has his facts straight on serialization, book binding, old books on satanism, and probably many things I did not catch, as I'm not an expert on certain subjects in the book.  It's dark - but then, any book that dealt with secret societies, authors burned at the stake by the Inquisition, murders that might or might not be suicides, and being paid to steal valuable and rare books on demonology, should be dark.  I enjoyed it, mostly because I found so many bits and pieces that agreed with things I already knew, making it feel almost like fact, not fiction.  It reminded me of Christopher Marlowe, actually.  The book does contain unnecessary sex and some necessary violence.  I didn't notice much swearing, so if it's included, it's appropriate.
0679731377|5.0|Julian Barnes's History of the World is 307 pages long and spans mankind's &quot;history&quot; from the Biblical Flood era through modern times-and to boot, it ends with a treatise on the afterlife. Before you ask, the font face is 12-point Arial font. Needless to say, in this History a few things are left out (the moon walk, Caesar crossing the Rubicon, either World War, the founding of Rome, the Reformation, the Emancipation Proclamation, the banning of Ulysses). Thankfully, though, none of what's left out is very important in the grand scheme of things.  First, what is here: stories from the underbelly-a first-person account by a stow away on Noah's Ark; the story of a tour-guide-cum-hostage of an anti-Zionist group in the Mediterranean; sixteenth-century court documents from a trial for blasphemy; the love letters of a washed-out 20th-century B-move actor; a golfer in heaven with a handicap of infinity.  Barnes does what every good author would do with this subject matter-he avoids it entirely. Outside academia and obsessed Ph.D. fruitcakes, no one wants to return to a lecture on History of the Western World 101 (Barnes tackles Western Civilization only, mind you; he doesn't touch anything Eastern). And so it's a good thing that events are not the issues here: Barnes runs through the book a series of themes that run through the world, outside of the major events: themes of love, of hope in absurdity, of struggling after fleeting faith.  Every scholar is saying-what do these emotions  matter in the end? Is this some tract on hippy-love?  No, this is not bed-hopping, tree-hugging hooey: Barnes delivers ten short stories that are mentally engaging and artistically interesting. It is a study of history where, of course, history repeats itself: everyone's on an Ark from time to time, a certain woodworm keeps cropping up, love is constantly butting heads with history or civilization and always there is an antagonism and a vitality to life that doesn't come from the Big Events of human history- Barnes answers his own questions about why we have virtues that don't mean horse puck in the evolutionary scheme of things: because if we didn't have these virtues, all the history in the world would be nothing more than dates and numbers.  Barnes's ideas are first-rate. The only complaint with the book is that it does drag now and then: An all-encompassing history book collects the world together, which means the fantastic alongside the merely marginal; unfortunately, in the same way at times Barnes's prose is anemic not long after it's enthralling. He waxes brilliant in his ½ of a chapter, but uses about ten pages too many to get to his  point. The chapters, however, are all of such a length, and change tempo so easily, that just as the  book bogs down, the scene shifts and the reader is asked to examine everything from a new angle. The way that a good history should be studied.ig Events of human history- Barnes answers his own questions about why we have virtues that don't mean horse puck in the evolutionary scheme of things: because if we didn't have these virtues, all the history in the world would be nothing more than dates and numbers.

0679735909|5.0|Byatt has shown talent before, but here she is simply brilliant. Set in the 1980s, the story is about two scholars who discover that the writers they are studying had secret liaisons. Their search for the details and answers to this mystery lead them through a series of intense intellectual and emotional adventures, always contrasting back and forth between their developing relationship and that of their scholarly prey. The balance of Byatt's character portrayals is especially gratifying; while the tone of the book is definitely feminist, there is no male/female typecasting. There are, in fact, no heroes or villains: only heroic and villainous acts, by fallible, inconsistent humans.  The fictitious writers, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte, are incredibly romantic 19th century characters. Byatt creates for each of them a body of works; for Ash, genuine, complex poetry; for LaMotte, complex and pithy fairy tales. In fact, the poetry is so good that I suspected it was copied. I was wrong; Byatt is that good. And if I still haven't sold you, I will add that there are scenes here of breathtaking erotic sensuality. Nothing graphic (give it a PG rating), but ooh wow! erotic.
0451450523|5.0|A unicorn over hears hunters saying she is the last of her kind and goes on a quest to Haggards kingdom to find if it is true.This is a wonderful story and anyone who enjoys unicorns and fansty should read it.
0684874350|5.0|Though purchased for someone else, as soon as I got it I knew I'd have to borrow it back. It was  a one day read, bringing me to the times and lives of past and present family members. Evoking a certain mystical awareness that has stayed with me since, enabling me to better sort and  see the world I have been born it.
0553476580|5.0|The concept isn't new but the way the author spins the tale of Santiago, the sheperd boy of lowly means who follows his heart to Egypt in search of his treasure, brings the reader, or in this case, the listener, as this is an audio book, to see the world as a living entity and all of its inhabitants as a part of a larger, greater being.<br />Santiago is faced with many hurdles on his journey.  The listener is able to draw on the boys' experiences and relate them to his/her own life.  As he suffers and rejoices, our own hearts are pulled to the point where we want to shout, &quot;Been there, Done that&quot;!<br />When Santiago has progressed to the point where he is ready for a teacher, the Alchemist appears.  He serves as mentor and friend to the boy and accompanies him to the pyramids where Santiago discovers &quot;his treasure&quot;.  They fall prey to warring tribesmen and thieves, all of which serve to strengthen the boys' resolve to see his journey through to the end.  This is a story of hidden treasures, real, and spiritual.<br />It needs to be listened to when one is not busy in traffic.  There will be times you need to rewind and repeat part of the story in able to fully glean the mysterious, if obtuse, lessons being taught.  A true New Age masterpiece, incorporating ancient wisdom with solutions for overcoming todays' problems.  I recommend it to anyone who is searching for something beyond the status quo!
0425129586|5.0|I's a well written book. It's also very confusing, It appeared that no one killed themselves but how else did they all die. It makes you want to ask a few questions 1) Who is the host? 2) Why were they there? 3) Who was the murderer? The murderer cleaverly concealed his/her identity till the end. It's a book of true suspence.
0380973634|5.0|Gaiman constantly impresses me with his wit and humor.  Neverwhere was a fantastic book with clever twists and turns.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever enjoyed one of his books.
068484267X|5.0|Having just finished &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and all of the reviews on Amazon...I had to add my notes. No one has mentioned the superior writing style and the unusual techniques of dialogue that were so well put to use in the writing of the book. I pushed the book back several times in awe of the unique style .  I believe that everyone has a story in them...but only the blessed few can tell theirs.  McCourt not only had the story to tell but the expertize to tell it well.  Didn't anyone else notice the fantastic new dialogue method???  To say that this book provoked memories of my childhood...pulled pathos and pain to my heart and yet showered no blame...would be putting it mildly.  I am extremely well read.  I have favorites.  But this story creates more stories...this story creates more questions...this story  creates challenges.. so, to Mr McCourt...if he were to ever read this, thank you!!  For the brilliant way you wrote and shared your story...  I sing the song to you! Sandra
0345350499|5.0|I have been fascinated by the Arthurian legends for many years ever since I took a class in college about the legends.  Ever since then I have read as many books about that subject as I can.  Out of all the books the one that impressed me the most and made a lasting impact on my life was Mists of Avalon.  No other book has changed my life as much as this one has.  It focuses on the female aspect of the legends especially the character of Morgaine.  Her struggle to regain the goddess religion out of the hands of the spread of Christianity is marvelously portrayed.  I feel that I become one with Morgaine and journey with her.  The book is quite long and may seem daunting at first but when I was finished reading it I wished that there was more.  In my eyes it was too short.  My heart and soul have never been moved by a book as much as they were moved by Mists of Avalon.
0399142851|1.0|I think Patricia Cornwell hit her peak with &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot; and it's been downhill ever since, particularly with Cause of Death and now Unnatural Exposure.  I didn't read Hornet's Nest.  It seems like all she does now is do research on the latest technology the FBI has access to and  builds a story around it, filling as many pages as possible with boring details that don't advance the story at all.  I remember reading Cruel and Unusual and All That Remains in a day or two.  I read From Potter's Field quickly too.  This book took me two months at least because there was no suspense, no interesting human elements.   I was hoping she would develop the character of Wingo and the suspect Keith Pleasants (?) a lot more.  When the two recognize each other early on in the book I was hoping something interesting would develop there, but it wasn't picked up again until near the end of the book and only dealt with in a sentence or two.   There were some interesting things threatening to occur in Lucy's life but they never came to pass.  It's as if Cornwell had a deadline to meet and decided she didn't have time follow through on any of the interesting possibilities she introduced.
0374266425|5.0|Gaardner's book is wonderful, not just because it is a solid story, but (more importantly) because it is an excellent introduction to world of Philosophy.  By telling the story of the history of philosophy to a 14 year-old girl, Gaardner makes it accessible to all of us.  You don't need to be a philosophy major in order to understand that ideas have consequences; and we all have our own worldview, whether we know what it is or not.  As a sometime teacher of philosophy, I applaud Gaardner's ability to take such a daunting subject, and lay it out in such an accessible manner.  I recommend it for anyone (even 14 year old Girls.)
006017322X|5.0|Your blurb for the book tells us that this is the book that made many of you fall in love with reading. I can't quite say that, since I loved reading before I was given this book by a neighbor when I was about 13 or so (around 8th or 9th grade if I remember correctly).<br /> I remember reading it in two days and starting it all over again when I finished it. This was the book that made me take note of writing for what it was rather than for just telling a story. I remember repeating certain phrases that I liked over and over. I also recall that I was reluctant to return it to my neighbor and took some of my paper route money to buy myself a copy which became dog eared over the years. I have since lost it, but have replaced it with a couple of hard cover copies. In any case, I remember being taken with the simplicity of the way Scout told the story and drew me in. The tormenting of Boo Radley by Jem, Scout, and Dill reminded me of similar escapades my friends and I would pull on the Radley-like folks in our own neighborhood...you know, everyone had that &quot;one house&quot; in the neighborhood that had a scary reputation. I'm sure that added greatly to my enjoyment of the book.<br /> I also remember the quiet dignity of Atticus and how, inadvertently, Harper Lee taught us all a lesson in tolerance, love, and especially the meaning of family. This book still makes an impression on me nearly thirty years later, and it is the one book I re-read twice a year without fail just for pure enjoyment and to spark those memories of when I first read it. I have yet to read anything like it. My deepest gratitude to Harper Lee for this wonderful book!
0671004107|4.0|I first read this book in the '80s, when I was pre-teen. I adored it. I still rank it in the top 5 &quot;first contact&quot; novels, along with 2001, Childhood's End, Gateway, and Rendezvous with Rama. Other reviewers here have covered what's so good about this book in the months before the movie opened in Japan, so let me tell you why I took off 2 points. <br /> First, Sagan rubs his belief in the moral equivalence between the United States and the Soviet Union into the book. Sagan is entitled to his beliefs; after all, that's what the Cold War was about. If the movie was more true to the book, however, I think this point would have put off thousands of people from going to the theater and thus prevented them from receiving Sagan's worthy messages. <br /> Second, the way scientists deal with facts is not as simple as the book and the movie put it. I am not a postmodernist, but everyone uses a theory to register what he or she sees as a fact. All theories have core assumptions that cannot be refuted by facts alone. The difference between science and everything else is in how those assumptions are formed, modified, and discarded (if ever). Maybe Sagan felt that he could not give this away, given the strength of fundamentalism and postmodernism in the United States. <br /> Apart from this, I recommend this book heartily.
0374266425|4.0|Who am I, what am I, and where am I are questions you are forced to consider as you read and reread this book.  The book is a philosophical mystery disguised as a text book, child's book and sci fi book all rolled into one.   Reality becomes fiction and fiction reality making you question your very existence.  Sophie, Hilde, me and my mother and I...are we one...many...or just a figment of this review.
0684874350|5.0|A must read for anyone who feels their own life is tough.  This book puts life in perspective and has the ability to thank everyday for what you have.  Very compelling.  A fantastic read.
044651506X|3.0|You had me for 400 pages.  Maybe I appreciate seaside tales because I was raised in land-locked Ohio.  I couldn't wait to reopen the book, even when I discovered the bad guy a hundred pages earlier. <br /> Me?  I?  Awfully personal!  That is the problem with the last one hundred pages. The point of view is first person.  A very cynical, sexist, cocky  and genuine first person.  We  know the bad guy.  The narrator's partner is expendible.  We are all in a hurricane.  What's the problem?  &quot;I&quot; can't be killed.  Not by bullets, gas or ocean.  &quot;I&quot; am narrating.  &quot;I&quot; am alive.  For 80% of the book, &quot;I&quot; wasn't relevant to the great tension &amp; intrigue.  There was no tension in the climax because &quot;I&quot; am alive. <br /> It is a shame for the author to have gone so far with a colorful plot, only to lose it at the end.  In this case -- the &quot;I's&quot; don't have it.
0880389052|5.0|Once again, R.A. Salvatorer draws us into a world where our hero, Drizzt, is faced with his own morality.  A virtual mirror image of Moorcock's Elric, Drizzt has a mirroring dilema as well.  Where the eternal champion is on a journey of self discovery, the drow warrior knows himself all too well and must live the reality of others perceptions of him.  Salvatore's legendary swordplay choreography is expertly matched with the social/political intrigue of Menzoberanzan.
0345350472|5.0|Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) is one of Dick's best and most important books. Not only is it fast-paced and full of mystery and intrique, but it explores deeper themes, such as what separates man from machine and, ironically, how thin that division can be.  For those of you who have only seen the Humphrey Bogart-like movie Blade Runner, the original novel is at least twice as good and twice as deep.  A must read for those interested in the classics of sci-fi and one of its grand masters.
1563523302|5.0|Here is one of the very few books available that isn't selling false gimmicks to &quot;get rich quick.&quot; With so many snake-oil salesmen out there spouting their sucker pitches to the naive masses, it is a heartfelt relief to finally read a book that spells out the fundamental equation for amassing wealth: thrift, savings, and sensible, steady investment.
0517122707|5.0|The beauty of this book is not the self-delusional bombast of Ignatius O'Reilly, although the bombast is pure hilarity. The beauty is in the language and the imagery.  American English hasn't been used so artfully in a century or so; it is flowery, floriferous, and florid.  The imagery is so deceptive in its simplicity, one is amazed the technique isn't commonplace.  Toole describes scenes as we would see them but would be unable to describe adequately.  Finally, Toole presents a character (characters, actually) we know in others and in ourselves - in part, if not in sum.  I borrowed this book, but I am buying my own copy.  This is one of the rare books that demands rereading.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is the epitome of what the graphic novel can be.  Kingdom Come is everything a comic book wants to be.  Watchmen is so much more.  It is one of the best stories you'll find anywhere.  The depth, complexity, dialogue and art are superb.  Moore creates an incredibly intricate universe of characters that are both likable and believable. The art is crisp and realistically drawn.  Gibbons switches drawing styles seamlessly throughout the book.  I've collected comics for the better part of 25 years and I've never seen anything better.  If you love comics, you won't forgive yourself if you pass Watchmen by.

0872860175|5.0|HOWL defies comparison with anything.  Ginsberg cracks open the mind of America--while riding on an hallucinogenic roller coaster--and takes a studied look inside.  The style is incredible, pyrotechnical, it transcends words themselves, taking on the characteristics of a hieroglyph.  Using all elements of the profane, he creates something holy.  Should be required reading in all bars, bowling alleys and elementary schools.
0679735909|4.0|This book is a page-turner, but it did not deserve the Booker Prize. While the poetry was quite impressive, the prose was often awkward and stilted. This was distracting, but not distracting enough to stop me from finishing the book!
6304106017|4.0|If you are looking for George Clooney in a role even remotely close to his &quot;ER&quot; personna, this isn't the place to find him!  Clooney is a thief who, along with his brother (Quenton Tarrantino), head South of the Border to avoid capture after they rob a bank and kill a policeman.  They take a father and his two kids along as a cover.  Once they reach the bar in Mexico where Clooney &amp; Tarrantino will meet with someone who will help them hide out, the real ride begins.  Vampires abound and the nasty Seth Gecko (Clooney) tries to save the very people he's been terrorizing.  In the end, even this nasty character has heart, something Clooney pulls off.  You wind up forgetting what he's done before and you salute what he's become.  Still cussing, he rides off into the sunset and you find yourself wishing you could jump in the car with him.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, but an interesting change from the &quot;ER&quot; character Clooney is famous for.   END
044651506X|1.0|Plum Island was the worst book I read all summer.  John Corey demonstrates disrespect for people and property throughout the entire novel while bragging about it.  The characters and the plot are both underdeveloped.  How many times did Detective Penrose have to tell Corey to calm down while he disrepectfully destroys both property and civil rights?  A horrible novel.
0425152251|5.0|To say that Sophie's World is a novel about the history of philosophy, is like saying that The Odyssey is a travel story.  The story within the story brings the work to life.

0060925000|5.0|Initially apprehensive of the size of the book, it draws one rapidly into the complexities of Indian family life.  Seth writes with a pen that remains vibrant throughout, with enough continuity to hold the reader until the final chord.<br /> I thoroughly enjoyed it, the insight it gives to a European of Indian culture around Partition was great.  Even my wife, a reluctant reader of contemporary fiction, was captured!
0312955006|5.0|this book drew me in right from the start and I could not put it down.  I guess it is true that you can judge a book by it's cover.  I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and enjoyed them all - this one was wonderful.  It drew the reader in and really allowed you to get to know the characters.  It was well written and totally addictive - once you opend it you couldn't put it down!
0787105465|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I loved this book. Don't ask me why.  The writing was truly awful and full of not-very-convincing aphorisms.  In fact, the whole book could have been a cliche except for the fact that somehow, somewhere, the story made a lot of sense. It's so believable I actually thought the characters were real.  Waller may not be a great writer, but the story, once you get past the cliches, is told with compassion and intelligence.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is the story of a white family living in the rural south during the 1930s. This family is faced with many challenges in such a short span of time. The reader gets to see how the family grows both together and apart and also how it copes with its day to day life. This book deals with such issues as racism, neighborhood togetherness and the bonds that either grow or are lost between parents and children as they grow together. This book focuses on the strength of the family institution and it gives insight into the way we (and the world at large) were. Life has definitely changed since this book was written 37 years ago, but in the same respect, it has changed many people who have read it. This is that people for ages to come will both love and enjoy.
0679745203|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and was completely captivated by both. When you read the book (if you love beautiful words) you will see the images shown in the same breath-taking style as was shown on film. If you like common, ordinary, 6th grade use of vocabulary and romance novel-style love stories, this book is not for you.  If The Bridges of Madison County is your idea of lost love, I would suggest that you stick with that style of writing and leave the poetic and beautiful writing of Michael Ondaajte to those who LOVE great writing.

0399142851|1.0|This patient is DOA! I anxiously awaited the release of this book since Kay Scarpetta is one of my favorite fictional characters. Thank goodness I got it at the library. It was awful! The plot was old &amp; tired. It was also a very easy read (large print and big margins). I hope Ms. Cornwell doesn't succumb to publisher pressure with her next Kay Scarpetta. Let's get back to the original plots and developed storylines.
0684874350|5.0|I love to read but lately I have been struggling to find the time to do so.  I decided to try some audio tapes so I could make better use of my time on the road.  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was one of the first audio books that I bought.  I grew up in an Irish, Catholic home and thought the story sounded interesting.  I was not disappointed.    For those of you who have read the book, I HIGHLY recommend the audio tapes.  Frank McCourt himself reads to you and it is indeed a treat.  The sounds of his voice and his accent bring the story to life.  Tis a fine listen!  WHAT IS IT, BOYS?  Tis a fine Listen, Sir!  I think I'll buy the book, too!
0399142851|2.0|After the disappointment of Hornet's Nest, I rushed out to buy UE. I enjoyed the beginning, but got more and more disappointed. Like other reviewers, I did not remember the villain.Was this a rush job? Also, PLEASE, Scarpetta, stop whining all the time! Scarpetta has changed a lot from the strong woman she was in early books - maybe she should get rid of Benton - he seems to bring out the worst in her. Please no more Italian recipes - if I want them, I will by an Italian cookery book. Still, I am most probably going to by the next Scarpetta novel, to see whether things (plots) are improving.

0399142851|2.0|At what point in a successful writer's career does she get bored with her own work or, worse,become so valuable a publising property that any evidence of editorial assistance disappears? If you were charting Cornwell's stock as a commercial endeavor: BUY, but as a developing work with tighter plot lines and more intricate personalities: SELL. The 'willing suspension of disbelief' is essential for any fiction:Cornwell's plot lines stretch the faith,and the endings are moving from fiction into fantasy. The fact that all her titles become bestsellers is akin to gulls following the garbage barge. It's a boat I have been on.............I'm getting off.
0140001115|5.0|I read this book and this is definitely my favorite of all the books I have read. This book is very, very, suspenseful and a little spooky.

I would recommend this book to anyone.
0441003257|5.0|Ever finished a book that was so good, so great, so indescribable, you didn't want to start another one for a week or so? I read books like some people eat popcorn, but this is only the second one I've ever given a &quot;ten.&quot; Many times I just closed the book and sat laughing at the sheer _cleverness_ of what was happening. I could, and will, read this one over and over.
094113086X|4.0|Yes this book is hard to put down, but by the end I found it hard to believe.  First the man is tortured for a year before his trial, he is starved and brainwashed.  Then he endures a long trip in a railroad car across Russia--so far so good.  Then he does an 800 mile forced march in sub-zero weather and on starvation rations of bread and water.  Later when he has recovered he and a group escape during a blizzard.  The overland ordeals are plausible until they get to the Gobi desert and go nine (9) days without water is this possible--I thought people couldn't survive desert temperatures more than a few days at most.  Then they cross the Himalayas with no equipment and endure more sub-zero temperatures.   Finally they see strange Yeti-like creatures. Somehow I just can't believe this tall tale.  And it is interesting to note that the other survivors of this Long Walk could not be found and the narrator's memory was reported to be fuzzy.  This story came out at the height of the Cold War--and I think the line between fantasy and reality was crossed somewhere along the way. I've searched for stories to corroborate this yarn but all I found were book reviews.  Does anyone have any hard evidence that this is a true story?
0385472951|4.0|Good read, but if you've read all of his books you might be a little disgruntle.  One good lawyer book is enough for me.  This definitely was it.  Check out Airframe. That's nice.
0451191153|5.0|Saul Bellow was once asked about Ayn Rand's work. He replied&quot;...yes..I read something of hers before.  I remember I felt like I just had my suit pressed...while I was still in it.&quot;  I know people who love this work and people who hate this work.  I've encountered people that have tried to be Howard Roark, and known people who have dropped out of architectural schools after reading this work.  regardless of hate or love one must respect a work for being able to make us feel the way we do, for makeing us act the way we act, and for makeing us think the way we think.  This book, for me anyway, is a shineing example of what words are capable of.  I was on a bus to arizona and I heard a woman talking about The Fountainhead.  She hated it because she tried to live like Howard Roark for 2 years, and failed to become &quot;like him&quot;.  She had rage in her voice, and anger, genuine and pure balled up her fists.  I have to respect any written work that can generate such internal intensity in the reader.
0440111498|3.0|Cat's Cradle is good, but not great.  I can't understand why it has recieved such praise.  I've read everything by Vonnegut, and I can think of several works by him that outshine this one.  I enjoyed reading it, but it certainly isn't one of his best.  For the record I liked Breakfast of Champions and Welcome to the Monkey House the best.
0399142851|4.0|Kay Scarpetta, (and her now grown up niece Lucy), track a criminal who teases and taunts them online through AOL.  It's timely and scary. A surprising and vengeful monster, uses terrifyingly plausible ways and means to inflict cruelty and death. A unique mystery thriller from favorite author Patricia Cornwell.   Definitely a timely book, using new and fresh ideas, featuring  our familiar and comfortable heroine.
0380002930|5.0|I never thought that a book could be so wonderful and imaginative, like a report about real people. The protagonists are like real charakters, their actions full of human qualities (though they are rabbits). Its a real &quot;Must&quot; for rabbit lovers! Also the second book, &quot;Tales from Watership Down&quot; should find its place in the bookshelf next to &quot;Watership Down&quot;!
0345315227|2.0|While I have not read the entire novel, I have read the excerpt published several months ago in Playboy. I must say that, unfortunately, even this brief taste of 3001 was bitter. It failed to interest me. I also didn't accept the fact that Poole could have survived in space for a millenium. At least I'll always have 2001 to revisit.
0380002930|4.0|A book that you will cherish all the days of your life.  I'm 29 and I read the book first in Junior high.  Today I saw the cover and once again I entered a world that is full of struggle,  sorrow,  friendship and hope.  The memories are that vivid!   A must read if you can read.
0440131480|5.0|Speaking as one who has just finished reading _Timequake_ (his latest) and thus can be accurately qualified as one who has read all of Vonnegut's &quot;major&quot; works, I can say with authority that _Breakfast of Champions_ is is best.  Simple on the outside, yet with far-reaching questions of where we are headed, the book is chillingly accurate in modern-day, &quot;progressive&quot; 1997, even though it was written sometime in the early 70s.  This book should be read by anyone who has ever wondered about technology, New York city, or the finer works of this gifted novelist.  Definitely a 10. [And lest I forget -- the book comes with pictures, interspersed liberally through the pages; rough-looking and hand-drawn though they may be, they contribute a fanciful air to the already-impressive work.  They, too, are definitely a plus.]
0452270073|5.0|An accutely precise mix of historical and fictional characters illuminate the tragedy of WWI. Dr. Wm. Rivers cures the shell-shocked and returns them to the insanity of the Western Front, changing himself and the reader as well. Also see &quot;The Face Of Battle&quot; by John Keegan!
0060916540|5.0|There are rare books that help to define the limits of what it can mean to be human. Without fear of employing hyperbole, this is one of them. Joe Simpson has done nothing less than extend the envelope of what it is possible to survive, to endure, for everyone who reads Touching the Void. His writing style is brutally efficient, making Hemmingway seem long-winded. The reader is overwhelmed by the feeling that if more people read this book, there would be less complaining, more personal responsibility, and fewer people who quit at the first (or hundredth) sign of trouble in their lives. It is not so much inspirational as it is instructional. Buy it. Read it. Never give up!
0140042520|5.0|The sense of nature Kerouac captured in this book is an important message in this work-shop-consume world. And he conveys so much appetite for life! I especially enjoyed the Gary Snyder character: &quot;The closer you get to real matter...(rocks, mountains, etc.) the more spiritual the world is.&quot; I&quot;M READING IT AGAIN!
0553573403|5.0|This is the most exciting book I have read in a long time.  The characters are very engaging, and each is unique without becoming a caricature.  The sense of an entire world's history culminating in a fierce and dramatic confrontation in which the characters are well drawn and engaging is irresistable.  I also love the way the landscape becomes such a real part of the story.  The plains, the frozen Northern lands beyond the Wall, the fertile Southern valleys all become so real I could picture them.  What else can I say?  Martin brings together myth, adventure, fantasy, romance, just about everything that a great tale could possibly have.  I eagerly await the sequel.  It'll probably be the first hardbound book I buy new in years.  I can't imagine waiting for the paperback version to find out what happens to the characters I have grown to care about.
0380973634|5.0|An incredibly delicious book....You can't help but read it multiple times, trying to savour every second, every minute, every syllable. <BR> I had been a long-time Sandman fan, and this novel proved to me that Gaiman's talent can translate very easily into regular prose. <br /> A must read for everyone!
0679745203|5.0|I must say first of all, this is a work which requires the reader's utmost concentration and participation. Definitely read this alone, even if it means being without your lover for awhile. I guarantee that you will want the company after reading only a few pages. This work is so stunning, I truly feel that Ondaatje has transformed the pages into a canvas with his words serving to color each page with vivid detail of the characters. From descriptions of clothing to temperatures, burning desire, heartbreak and joy, I recommend this work to anyone who has ever truly known the definition of love and experienced all the emotions possible from loving another. I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. If you do see the film, see it with someone close to your soul.
0802130208|5.0|The most hilarious novel written this century! I don't want to spend too much time explaining to disbelievers, but if you have a love for literature and characters that really stand apart from the rest, there is nothing quite like this read. Ignatius Reilly is an original delight. Please, please, PLEASE, do not miss this treasure.
044651506X|5.0|Just when you thought Demille couldn't get any better... The Charm School was captiviating, The Gold Coast steamy and suspenseful. Demille has outdone himself once again with Plum Island. A spellbinding story of lust and murder and in the intricate weave of another small Long Island town. A master storyteller.
0671004107|5.0|In telling a story about first contact with extra-terrestrials, Sagan has managed to explore ideas about religion, politics, and science, without sacrificing character development, plot, or suspense.  He engages the reader, not only in the life of the protagonist, but also in the exciting interplay of intellectual arguments.  Contact is a book that asks the reader to examine his or her own assumptions and beliefs, and in doing so, the reader gains a better understanding of the book, and the world.
0385121679|5.0|I think Mr. King nearly scares us to death with his blank terror written down in this novel. Pro: Characters, Story and ... the details ! Nearly never saw that much details in another King-book before. Contra: The Villain. The Overlook hotel is a little bit too much personalized in my opinion, the human factor is too big here ...
0140143505|5.0|Throughout this slim volume of correspondance, Hanff reveals the sort of human interaction we all cherish.  She is witty and often painfully blunt.  I found myself murmuring &quot;Bravo!&quot; and chuckling outloud.  Hanff's very British bookseller penpal is as prim and proper as she is forward and brash. It provides a marvelous juxtaposition of personalities.  The images in 84 Charing Cross road are vivid, the letters describe their 20+ year friendship in poignant detail.  In a characteristic gesture, Hanff allows us to share in the 20 year development of a treasured friendship.
079271735X|5.0|This is a wonderfully researched biography of the one and only Marilyn.  Starting with Marilyn's great-grandparents, to her childhood, to her years as Norma Jeane, to her claim to fame, up until her last days and hours, this book has it all.  With pages and pages of beautiful photos, a filmography, and a detailed investigation into her death, you will not want to put this book down.  This book is a must to anyone interested  in Marilyn Monroe's life.
0441003257|5.0|If you are at all a fan of Monty Python or simply enjoy a funny but intelligent book, read Good Omens.
0679745203|5.0|I believe this is the most marvelous book I have ever read.  I am amazed at how Ondaaje used sentence fragments to completely tangle me in this book.  He is a brilliant writer.Katharine's chapter is the most beautiful piece.  It is the way you would want a lost love to describe you.  I read the book before the movie- and although both are lovely, the book brings you to a point in you imagination that you cannot control.  &quot;Who lays the crumbs of food that tempt you?  Towards a person you never considered.&quot;  The words flow into your train of thought on a daily basis.  You will end up giving this book to everyone you know and love.  I completely recommend it for your life.
0679735909|5.0|I found this book completely enchanting and didn't tire of it in the least.  I was drawn in from page one and loved every bit of it!
044651506X|4.0|Detective Corey moves from the role of cynical &quot;consultant&quot; to a murder to the one bound to get the bad guy. The sexist, loud-mount, rude, obnoxious detective stops being a cop and becomes pissed when the murderer makes the case personal. Don't look for social justice or deep plot development. This is the story of a police officer who throws away the law to get the bad guy, and cares not about anyone who gets in his way. Not pretty but a good read.
0449000729|5.0|How can an author treat the history of a country in one volume?  Read Rutherfurd's &quot;Sarum&quot; and find out.  It spans an incredible time period (pre-historic times to the present day).  He does so in an immensly interesting and readable way.  It's easily one of the best books I've ever read.  Rutherford has a new book out called &quot;London&quot;, and if it's anything like &quot;Sarum&quot; it's sure to be a winner!
0684874350|5.0|I almost didn't purchase Angela's Ashes, afraid it might just sadden me to read it.  However, I had the good sense to buy the book and now everyone on my Christmas list will get a copy.    This book manages to tear your heart apart in one scene because of the injustice and unfairness of it all and then on another page, it lifts you up again in ways words can't decribe.  It inspired me, even changed me.  As I sat in the warmth of a big comfortable chair, sipping hot chocolate, I read about this child who literally had no warmth, no comfort, no hot drinks and it made me really, truly appreciate the small things in life.  In this age of grand scale commercialism and celebrity hype, Angela's Ashes is a refreshing reminder of what truly counts.  And I had a revelation, that these things like warmth and light are not such small things after all.
0345363132|5.0|<BR>I picked this book up at random one dull afternoon and could not put it down. Penman made Medieval England come alive for me in a way no one else ever had. You can completely lose yourself in the past with her books and feel like you are there. This book started my love of Penman's works.<BR><BR> Penman's Richard is a wonderful character that you cannot help but fall in love with and feel for. He is a man before his time who sees power as an obligation and a burden rather than a right and something to abuse for his own amusement. His struggle to do the right thing amidst power and glory hungry nobles is made even more tragic since you already know how it ends. Still, you find yourself hoping that he will win out in the end.
0875845851|5.0|I loved this book because it challenges conventional management cliches about &quot;customer focus&quot;.  Christensen clearly outlines how customer focus becomes a trap when a firm is faced with a &quot;disruptive technology&quot;.  The book offers both theory and practical advice and does both well; a rare feat.  I found this book directly relevant to my own organization's innovation strategy.  A superb piece of work.
0380002930|5.0|That pretty much summerizes the entire book, though no simple statements can do this work justice.  I mean, who else could take a concept so fundamentally silly as rabbits and actually make it valid literature?<br /> Besides that, it's also a damn good story too, enough for all ages, and all ages should read this novel.  It emphasizes freedom and the decisions to do what you want to do without anyone else ordering you around.  And Adams manages to do that without becoming preachy or condescending.<br /><br />It must have took a lot of effort for Adams not to make this into a term paper on rabbits, but he pulled it off and the effort shows.  This is one of the few books that deserved the word classic when it was printed and still deserves it twenty years later, and will probably still apply twenty years hence.  Brilliant.
0441172717|5.0|You will find no nine eyed purple Martians attacking planet earth in &quot;Dune&quot;, but human fears and desires in extraordinary circumstances. Deeply psychological, intricate relationships and power plays give this book a unique flavour. I especially liked the separation of a human from an animal by the ability to stand immense pain, and overcome the urge/reflex to withdraw his hand from a &quot;pain box&quot; - i.e. placing the will before the instinct.   Do read this book (not once, but several times), and see if you also yearn for the &quot;spice&quot; - that mother of all hallucinogens found only on Dune that allows clairvoyance - among other things.
0062502182|5.0|I found this in a local book store.  I live in France, and are always on the look out for books I can read in English (I'm Australian.)  I found this while looking for The Portrait Of A Lady (I'd seen the film the night before.).  I decided to get this bok, as I thought it would be a nice 'light' read.  Was I wrong.  While it is easy to read, it really made me think...  I think this is one of the best books I have read all year, and in fact I have read it 3 times since getting it (one month ago)...
0451452739|5.0|This book was the first I read about Sci-Fi, and I love it! The begining and the ending are great, they give you somethig to think about. I recomend it for everyone who likes to read Sci-Fi.
0345389409|5.0|Ever have questions about god and devil?  Does this inspire such a uncomfortable feeling inside you make it so you can't even utter a word?  Now even if you could utter a word does the subject matter give your tongue the flexibility of when you have a tongue depressor on it?   Does Anne Rice seem to have a excellent grasp of these common human emotions?  Does Anne Rice still talk about all this subject though  and quite poetically I might add? Thankfully for all us she certainly does and in this book of this ongoing saga between god and the devil for the ultimate prize of the  main characters soul it finally comes to a head.  During all of her books her main emphasis is on the character Lestat and whether he  truly ends up redeemed or not.  In this book though she leaves you completely guessing to the point that you don't even think Lestat  himself the narrator has any clue of what's going to finally happen in the end.  Through out the whole series Lestat has this almost  endearing arrogance of having complete control on what's going to happen next and the rarest of occasions occurs in this book.  In this  book though this supernatural being himself is finally cut down to size and lead to feel the most human of emotions there is....fear. Now what leads him to thus almost unconceivable emotion considering he himself is a vampire? The final realization of something he never believed was possible for an immortal such as himself...and that's a final judgement.  He feels  it every day more and more intensely as he realizes that he the vampire is being stalked.  While not only that but it's by such an ominious  &quot;presence&quot; that it cuts through all his arrogance and makes him truly truly scared.  Now as you might be noticing I'm embellishing upon this fact of him scared and your probably wondering why...well because as someone who read the rest of the series it's because it didn't seem possible. So now you ask again, &quot;What on earth could have this supernatural monster scared?&quot; Now that's it were not dealing from anything or anyone of the earth as we know it because he's being stalked by the devil himself!  Now after the  main character Lestat finally comes in contact with this being who's stalking him and it presents itself as it's true form.  You then get taken on a roller coaster ride between heaven, hell and even what it's like to exist in pergatory as Lestat experiences all this first hand. Now you're probably  thinking great premise, controversial subject matter and honest dealings with life's heaviest questions.  Sure that's great but what gets this book more  than a seven or an eight.  It's the author herself because nobody but nobody can write a novel of this particular genre better than she can.  What is it about her that sets her apart from such an already well established industry.  Well it's her simple ability not only to turn a phrase, and craft the most intoxicatingly detailed sentences. But in addition to that her firm grasp of everything that is religious.  Whether it's her descriptions of the stalkings of Lestat in the first chapters which  inspire enough fear to make your hand so heavy as to not want to turn the page.  Or the utter disbelief at how realistically she describes Lestat's trips to  pergatory, heaven and hell.  You're left almost completely entranced by what's going on in the story to almost the point one poet would be in another poet's work. The thing is whether you're a poet or not you can appreciate this book.  Why? Now finally this is because to throw in extra added incentive for the reader she added a pure and perfect nun to be Lestat's new spritual guide through such uncharted  that the murderer himself of Dead Men Walking didn't even come close to have touched upon.  You put this all together and you get the best fiction book that this man himself  who only reads non fictions has ever read.  As I said it's describe through the pen of someone who could be a poet with such detailthat you can'thelp but turn every page. Than not only is it dealing with extreme subject matter but doing it in a way that keeps you guessing the whole time.  Will Lestat end up in heaven or in hell?  Will his soul be vexed or finally after five books saved?  While most importantly who will surprisingly be working together to reach this man's eventual goal?  I don't know but I guess in order to find  out you'll have to do your job and purchase this book yourself from this Amazon book source.
0684874350|5.0|What a lovely book and warm testament to Frank McCourt's family; especially his Mom.  It must have taken Mr. McCourt great courage to be able to write such a personal and devastating true-life story.    I congratulate him and commend him.  Writing this book must have been very therapeutic for him and a great emotional relief.
0679409866|5.0|Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot;  How does Anne Elliot deal with her &quot;faded bloom?&quot;  Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the 1990's can readily identify with.  Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self.  This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots.  It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture.
0876852630|5.0|Bukowski was coming with text &quot;on the real&quot; way before the documentary-era of the so-called new school of contemporary realists.  Brutal.  Honest.  Frighteningly funny.  CB embodies the American dream gone sour.  Dirty boxers and beer farts.  You must not miss Factotum.
0345350499|5.0|Normally one hears of the King Arthur and his evil sister Morgana La Fay.  Believe me, I have read almost every possilbe king arthur story, and this is the the accepted tale.  The Mists Of Avalon tells it another way.  From the eyes of Morgaine and her family, you see the struggle of the Druids to endure in a world that does not see them when they are in the face of the world.  It shows the internal struggle of any human grasping and understanding life and religion and what is set before you to do.  It does tell the tale most told, but in another manner.  It tells of the pagan struggle for identity in a world that was denying them.  It tells of ever one's strugle.  It has an intriguing plot, you cannot put it down, and from then on you see the world in a differnet light and you endure in your search for more books written by the same brilliant lady.
044651506X|4.0|Plum Island was great fun, and despite what the politically correct crowd has to say, I thought John Corey was a very likeable guy.  Being attracted to beautiful young women does not equate to being degrading and disrespectful of them.   I thought that the dialogue was at times, laugh out loud funny.  My only complaint was that the ending was a bit predictable and yet it was all solved in one page.  It appeared that Mr. Demille decided that all of a sudden, it was time to wrap it up and he gave us the killer.  Also, being from south Louisiana, I have had some experience with hurricanes, and small boats do not run through hurricanes and come out the other side. Overall, a really fun read, if you can climb down off of your politically correct mountain and have some fun.
0893815187|3.0|Very diappointing. This book was advertised and reviewed giving one the impression of it as being a master piece of nude child photography as well as an excellent depiction of childhood. To me the word childhood brings forth connotations if innocence and joyous abandon. Only two photos in this book contain so much as a smile, those being &quot; The Easter Dress&quot; (cute) and the other being &quot; Jessie and the deer&quot; which depicts a very little girl standing next to a dead deer with it's throat cut in the back of a truck (not cute).<br /> All of the rest of the photos contain blank facial expressions if not down right frowns. Sally Mann's &quot;models&quot; at times appear to be unwilling participants of her work. &quot; The Last Time Emmett Modeled Nude,1987&quot; is one such example, however, it does very well capture his little boy charm. He may have by the way been nude for the photographer, but not for the camera as he is submerged from the waist down in the river.<br /> The facial expressions in many of these pictures remind me of those I have seen from the Great Depression Era or those from Third World Countries rather than life in everyday America. &quot;Virginia at 3&quot; and &quot;The Wet Bed&quot; do effectively visualize that innocence we look for in childhood pictures whether clothed or not.<br /> There were by my count only 15 nudes out of 65 photos unless you count little girls of ages 3-9 with no shirts on as nudes. There was only one nude shot of Emmett, an intentional genital shot, with melted popsicle smeared over his lower abdomen and thighs. This shot doesn't even have a face. This was not a picture of her son who just happened to be nude, but a picture of his private parts with something smeared all over him. This is what she calls art???<br /> All I can say is it's a good thing that there's not a satisfaction guarantee with this book.
0425107469|5.0|I have read many of Dean Koontz's books and have loved them, but this is my favorite!  Don't try to describe this book to your family and friends, they'll roll their eyes and say it's totally unrealistic.  Unrealistic?  Yes.  But also believable!  Only Koontz could write about such an impossible concept, yet, make it sound feasible.  If you haven't bought it yet - trust me, read it.  Make sure, though, that you begin it on a weekend when you're not busy because believe me you won't want to put it down!

0684874350|5.0|I lost five pounds while reading this book, so vivid and nauseating did I find the descriptions of runny eyes and ropy yellow coughs and overflowing latrines, and I lost all notions of the poverty of Ireland (or anywhere) as quaint and charming or enobling. It is wretched and brings out the worst in people. The shortcoming and the strengths of the Irish come through Frank McCourt's narrative--literate and steeped in Irish songs and poems while subsisting on stolen apples and licking the grease and salt off of discarded fish and chip wrappings. From this book I understand the harsh humor and grim stoicism of my Irish Catholic family, and I appreciate the circumstances that motivate people to immigrate to the USA. I'm grateful my relatives escaped the potato famine. Also, we have come along in our understanding of alcoholism as a disease--but not far. The effects on Malachy McCourt's unwitting progeny paint a real picture of the crumbling chaotic lives such a disease can create as legac
0679735909|5.0|Within the first 10 pages of this book, I was drawn in to a Victorian world of intrigue, romance, and intellect.  The story is beautifully complex - seamlessly transporting you into and out of 2 separate worlds.  I've never liked novels with a Victorian &quot;sensibility&quot;; this one was wonderful!
0140049975|5.0|I have to put in my 2 cents for this classic. I can think of only two books which have created a world which has affected my soul as much as the real people in my life. One is Anna Karenina. The other is East of Eden. Steinbeck from the first page casts a spell. It is as if he is really telling his story of his ancestors, the Hamiltons. We are taken back to a post Civil War pastoral world with grassy scents and golden light. The prose is beautifully simple, rich, Mozartian. It is the most economical 700 page book I can think of. The &quot;joy of creation&quot; Steinbeck felt when writing it is evident. That joy makes up for its artistic flaws. I envy the readers who will be reading this novel for the first time. You're in for a treat.
0684803356|5.0|You understand you have to like Hemingway. This work embodied his distinct style of writing, the spare, yet eloquent manner that is known as his. Hemingway's ability to saddle every word with meaning and emotion is at it's ripest in this work, where he writes a war story that encompasses the entire spectrum of the human experience, form love to hate, spite to sacrifice. While the Spanish Civil War included tens of thousands, Hemingway writes of a handful of people who represent the whole of the country. Heroes do not always win in Hemingway's world, but in their defeat, they do win. The bravery and ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist captures that bitter fact of life. This novel has a meaning and lesson that can only be appreciated and understood by those who have read it. It would be a loss not to.
0671004107|4.0|Carl writes a possible scenario for contact with beings in other galaxies, and the reactions of groups pro and con to such a contact.  Being of fair mind as regards religion, race and sex, his characters are socially advanced for the mid 80's. <br /> The protagonist is a female astrologer who is the first to decipher messages from what seems to be outer space giving mankind the secrets to space travel.  Aspects of the inevitable space trip are imaginative and interesting, as are the motives and suspicions of the earthlings. <br /> Carl shares his own investigation into the rhelms of religion, science, human relations and politics as he attempts to help us understand and examine ourselves. <br /> Although full of worthy philosophical questions and well written, the book takes the reader to the brink of something significant and then drops the subject. It's not difficult to read (quite admirable for an academic), and although it's examination of motives is stimulating, it tends to meander regarding a goal. <br /> His target might be for the reader to search  and allow her/his imagination the freedom to find and evaluate truths... to consider the possibilities without prejudice. <br /> Maybe he did achieve a goal afterall.
0393314804|4.0|A keeper has to whack you.  A book you buy on a lark and then keep forever has to change how you think, how you see the world. Trainspotting whacked me. If it were only a description of the world as a &quot;bog&quot; (ie bathroom) it would be fascinating in a journalistic way.  But it's a bog with a purpose, a challenge of morality turned sideways, weird survival in an unsurvivable world.  The story is always &gt;going somewhere&lt;.  That energy, that need to make something &gt;new&lt; happen, that's the whacking part. I was dragged along kicking and screaming.   Also read this book and Sheperd's Bush will start to make a whole lot of sense.
0812548094|4.0|&quot;Stone of Tears&quot; is the second installment in Terry Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. It is very long. Through much of the book I found myself wondering when the author was going to get around to dealing with the Stone of Tears. Having now also read the third installment, I see that a great deal of &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; was setting up the background for the third book. I like this series a lot. It's a very worthwhile read.
0812550757|5.0|I read somewhere that frequent boredom is a sign of stupidity... I disagree. I think, in this case, a lack of understanding is more applicable.  I thought _Crime and Punishment_ was boring when I first read it--at the age of eleven.  _Speaker for the Dead_ is a philosophical tract under the facade of hard Science Fiction.  It should be read as such.  I didn't forsee that Card could top _Ender's Game_; Fortunately I was wrong.
0060801263|5.0|I first read about the Nolans when I was in the 7th grade for a class assignment and I have read &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; countless times since.  Although I am an avid reader of the classics- I always stray back to my ratty old copy of &quot;A Tree Grows...&quot; - the same copy that I have now had in my possesion for the past 18 years. I still get a tear in my eye when I think about Francie and all she endured- perhaps because I can relate to her life in so many ways. Like Mary Nolan did for her children- I hope to do for my own. As Mary Nolan had Neeley and Francie read a page from The Bible, and a page from Shakespeare every night before going to bed- my children will hopefully do the same- however they will  also read a page from &quot; A Tree Grows From Brooklyn&quot;. I only hope that they too will learn as much from the Nolans as I have over the years...
0140011749|5.0|Wodehouse paints a comedic picture with lively characters and plot that is hard to compare with any other written humor.  One has to be aware of dialoge and setting to glean all the gems from this writer. His style is fast paced and extremly funny challenging one to keep from laughing out loud. A must read

0140185232|5.0|Set between the two world wars, The Razor's Edge is a shrewd novel of idealism.  Supported by several finely drawn sub-plots is a circuitous study of a mans efforts to realize in himself the divine nature latent in each of us.  This ambitious book is an enjoyable and edifying success.
0425132153|5.0|No, I do not have a warped sence of humour. All that I think is funny is that you probably don't have a copy of this great book. May I ask why? That is not a very good excuse! BUY IT NOW! This is by far, far, far the best book EVER! Firstly take two brilliant authors, Neil Gaiman (Author of the Sandman comics) and Terry Pratchett (Author of the Discworld books), secondly take a  excellent storyline (What could be funnier than the Apocolypse?), throw in some excellent characters  the Anti-Christ, a Demon, an Angel, Beelzebub and, of course, a dog. TA-DA! You have one helluva book(Pun intended). Read it now before the is really upon us. No wonder Terry Pratchett said &quot;The Devil made them do it&quot;!

0812548094|3.0|Unfortunately, Mr. Goodkind failed at the job of writting an interesting sequel. Though he made a mighty effort to bring the story back together at the end, it was like trying to recapture the ballons blown to the four winds.  Dialoges were uninspiring, characters were imitation of book one. Gratch maybe is the only one with enough originality. But I wondered, did this gar have blood flies? Still, I would buy the third book, since it is not so thick therefore, less expensive.

0671570439|4.0|A radio signal might be the common way many civilizations make &quot;contact&quot; in the universe. Just as we make a simple phone call to family and friends around the planet, opposed to getting in a plane or car, traveling hundreds of miles, just to say hello.  Interstellar travel, although well theroized, at best reaches only a small percentage of light speed necessary for travel to be commonplace and practical. It would take thousands of years to travel between planets and systems outside our own.  The reality is that Radio waves, already traveling at light speed, would be the first &quot;wave&quot; of intelligence signals detected in the COSMOS. This book opens up the possibility that we may not have the technology to build masssive starships right now, but we have been, for over 60 years, traveling to the stars at lightspeed through the simple medium of radio! Think about it!  I don't know about the trasport/ship build in the story, but there are theories of wormholes in space. Maybe, through extreme dynamic physics and advanced radio technology, we could gain access to interstellar teleportation and transport ourselves into the universe as invisioned by Dr. Sagan...expand your mind..read this great book!
0380715430|5.0|I love books.  Being an aspiring writer I also love words, especially the origin of words.  So what is more natural than to love a book that is about words.  I think you should be proud of your language and should strive to learn it well.  You should be able to speak it and to spell it correctly. After all, it is your language. With this in mind, it has always interested me as to why we speak English the way we do.  What accounts for the idiosyncrasies?  Why do we spell particular words the way we do when it surely thumbs its nose at all logic?  The answers to these intriguing questions and more are in &quot;The Mother Tongue, English and How it Got That Way&quot;.   It offers such gems as the noted Samuel Johnson who once wrote that a 'garret' was the uppermost room in a house, and just a few lines later described 'attic' as the room above the garret.  Of course I noticed right away in my copy that on the inside cover blurb about the book it stated the first lines of the book were: &quot;Over 350 million people speak English...&quot; When you actually read the first lines of the text, it says: &quot;Over 300 million people speak English...&quot;  Wherefore art thou, Editor?  The book is very readable, which was a pleasant surprise.  Normally something of this ilk you would expect to be dry and boring.  Mr. Bryson does an excellent job of keeping the reader's interest.  This is a very informative book about the versatility of the English language.  It compares English to French, German, Spanish, etc., showing how rich English is in its vocabulary.  (From &quot;I Hear America Talking&quot; by Stuart Berg Flexner, PB by Simon &amp; Schuster 1979 ISBN: 0-671-24994-0   505 pages) The English language has at least 600,000 words, over 400,000 more than when the Pilgrims landed.  Most Americans are estimated to 'know' 10,000-20,000 words, but actually only 'use' half that number.  Of these, just 10 basic words account for over 25% of all speech and 50 simple words for almost 60%, with about 2,000 words accounting for 99% of everything we say.  The most common word spoken in American is 'I'.  The second most common is 'you'.  The third and fourth are 'the' and 'a'.  Mr. Bryson expounds on this a little by saying &quot;Websters 3rd New International Dictionary lists 450,000 words while the Revised Oxford English Dictionary has 615,000.  Technical and scientific terms would add millions more.  Altogether, about 200,000 English words are in common use, 184,000 in German, and only 100,000 in French.&quot;  The book tells why island, freight, and colonel are spelled in certainly unphonetic ways.  It tells why four has a &quot;u&quot; and forty doesn't.  Another quote from the book: &quot;Nothing in English is quite what it seems. Take the simple word 'what'.  We use it every day - indeed, every few sentences. But imagine trying to explain to a foreigner what 'what' means. It takes the Oxford English Dictionary five pages and almost 15,000 words to manage the task.&quot; Having a non-American wife and helping her with her English lessons, I am very aware of the idosyncrasies of the English language.  Especially when to her 'vase' sounds exactly like 'face' and she still thinks 'work' and walk' sound alike.  If you are interested at all in writing then this book is recommended as a good read.  It will give you some meaningful insights into the language and might prove beneficial one day in helping you write that novel.  It could very well help you find just the elusive right word you need for that particular sentence.  In the recent movie &quot;Throw Momma From the Train&quot;, about struggling authors, one of the on-going premises of the storyline is an inability of the two main characters to find a suitable word for the opening line of a story:  &quot;The night was _____.&quot;   Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, the actors, both mouthed alternate choices throughout the movie, until DeVito's mom came up with that special word that describedexactly what they wanted to say.  They continually tried words like: hot, wet, moist, warm, humid,  to describe how the 'night' was.  The mother character mentioned 'sultry', which of course was exactly the word they were searching for.  This is the sort of book that will help you to find your own 'sultry'.
0385474547|5.0|&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is not just a story about African natives, it could be about anyone. Okonkwo, the protagonist is caught up in the massive social turmoil brought on by the British invasion, but that is nothing compared to the inner turmoil he faces within himself. The physical world that he knows falls apart despite his herculean efforts to stop it, and his weaknesses and failings cannot allow him to live  in the new world.
0441003257|5.0|Pratchett is the cleverest humorist working in the field today.  This book amply demonstrates why.  The humour is not a series of one-liners, or arbsurd situations, it is a cleverly crafted accumulation of set pieces and characters.<BR>What gives this book the edge over the Discworld series is the sharpening of Pratchett's jocular wit by Neil Gaiman.  One of the most literate comic writers ever, Gaiman is the perfect foil.<BR>Together, they become a sort of Lennon/McCartney in the field of fantasy humour.<BR>I really don't need to mention the characters and premise, others already have, but virtually every page is a gem.<br /> If only they would write together again...<BR> I can't recommend this book highly enough.  I'd rate it a 12 if they'd let me!
0684800713|5.0|Hemignway was never one to pull punches about the hard facts of life in his writing, and in &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; the main character Jake is the embodiment of this view of life. An emasculated man, he is the linch pin that holds this band of homeless souls together. Each of the characters lives in a fantasy of their own to cushion them from the realization of how pathetic their existences are. Except for Jake. The strength he must have in order to face life in all its harshness without stumbling is nothing short of admirable. This is Hemingway's hero.
1567184855|5.0|This book offers many insights into one of the ageless question: What happens after death?  It opens a new outlook on life... and death.

Journey of Souls is a great account that will last more than a lifetime.

Samuel Shem, a psychiatrist, describes with no shame or censure, what's going on among young doctors in a busy hospital.  You are going to cry and laugh with every single human feeling (of either doctors and patients): fear of death, faith and unfaith, love, shame, frustration, sex, arrogance, despair, power, everithing! As a physician, I saw myself in many of the situations described in this book. Maybe your not a doctor but you were, are or will be (someday) a patient! At least, for this single reason, you must read this extraordinary book. No matter what is your opinion about doctors and hospitals - you will change it, after that.
0380002930|5.0|I reated this book a Best Buy Book, meaning you'd better buy it or you're missing out. This is a classic novel written by one of the best authors.

0140049975|3.0|This is not a story.  Rather it is a collection of stories about semi-related events occurring over a period of about 50 years, which in and of itself would not be such a bad thing, but East of Eden is so long!  The style of Steinbeck's prose is erratic at best which, again, wouldn't be so unpleasant if East of Eden weren't trying to pass itself off as a novel.  The basis of the story's symbolism is evident from the first chapter, but Steinbeck doesn't stop there.  He hammers his message home with a three ton sledgehammer that is about as subtle as a train wreck.  For example, each generation in East of Eden has a Cain character and an Abel character, and Steinbeck dives relatively deep when he begins the name of the corresponding characters with a &quot;C&quot; and an &quot;A&quot;.  That seems to be the limit of his subtlety as this bludgeoning draws slowly out over the torturous course of over seven hundred pages, finally grinding to a leadenly melodramatic finish.  And yet, at the end of this gruelling road, the message is still frustratingly vague.  The reader has suffered for nothing.  The sporadic insertion of episodes totally unrelated to the rest of the book is reminiscent of bits of trash floating in a river of sludge from some factory's drain pipe.  John Steinbeck is that factory, and in East of Eden he pumps out page after page of superficial writing.  As Steinbeck would, were he writing this review, extend the metaphor beyond its use, one might even consider East of Eden a waste product from the creation of masterpieces such as The Grapes of Wrath and Tortilla Flat.<br />  I see that East of Eden might contain a modicum of interest for students of Steinbeck (I myself have researched the man and used this book to defend a thesis), but someone looking to become acquainted  for the first time with the power that Steinbeck can wield would be better served by The Red Pony or one of the afore-mentioned alternatives.

6300248550|5.0|This wonderful version of Jane Eyre even out does the powerful Orson Welles version. This Jane (Zelah Clarke) is no weakling and, indeed, has a fine mind and firm grasp on her passions. While long (approx. 6 hours on two cassettes), it thoroughly covers the classic novel and gives it life. Purists may think that Timothy Dalton is almost too good looking to be Rochester - it's no wonder that Jane falls for him!  A lovely BBC production - too bad it's video and not film. Watch it on a cold winter weekend (with tea, of course) and enjoy!      Edited to update: This wonderful version is now available on DVD. The quality of the video tape shows its age but the overall production is still wonderful.

0312854021|5.0|Personally, I loved this book, but I think that there is nothing wrong with disliking it. However, it seems that many of the reviewers giving Ender's Game a 3 or lower are only trying to be cool, and to show how much better they are than the rest of us shmucks who really took something away from this book. Something would be wrong if everyone loved this book, but please, dont insult us with your overly harsh criticisms.
0425107469|5.0|That is what this book is all about, the love for a woman, the love for an animal, and the love that they return.  The dark and scary parts of this book cannot touch the love that bounds through this book.  I liked the book so well, I handed it to my eleven year old son when I got through with it.  Most of Koontz's books, I wouldn't dare do this.  Einstein was believable.  It made me want to just rush out the door and start teaching my old dog new tricks.

0393307050|5.0|These fabulous stories can be a bit difficult for those of us who have not served on a ship of the line in the 19th century. I, much like Dr. Maturin from the books, am drawn by the beauty and drama of the sea and the action faced by  a British man o' war but am ignorant of many of the terms and language. Patrick O'Brian is a  master at immersing his reader in the daily life of all the characters the reader encounters in his books. I have found &quot;A Sea of Words&quot; by Dean King to be a wonderful resource companion to O'Brian's novels. Full of descriptions of naval terms, historical maps, drawings and events of the time it is descriped by the publisher as &quot;A lexicon and companion for Patrick O'Brian's seafaring tales&quot; this book is at my side as I enjoy the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin.

0393038912|5.0|I read this book after becoming intrigued by the review it recieved from the N.Y. Times.  The question posed by the work is one that I have wondered about on occasion but have never seen directly addressed; namely, why have different societies reached widely varying levels of comlexitiy and technolgical development?  In exploring this question the author puts together a logical and compelling history of human civilizations.  I was particularly interested in the theories of plant and animal domesticaiton, and of the association of human diseases and animal contact.  The development of written language was also presented in a fascinating manner.  I came away from the book with a sense of awe that human societies have evolved to the complexity that they have, given the difficulties in achieving even seemingly simple goals such as sustainable agriculture.  It is rare to find a work as thought provoking as this.    My one criticism of the book is that there were times when there was more repetition than necessary to make a point.  This fact did not interfere, however, with  my enjoyment of the book.

I find it tremendously reassuring that the key factors of enduring success have to do with human beings, relationships, and hard work. Far from the bull hype and wet paint spins, this book is about companies with an average starting date of 1890-something. Let's wait a few more CEOs to see how Microsoft measures up. I just want to add my voice to those who feel it's a valuable text to study. As someone creating a company of human beings, particulary in a high-tech industry, this is great material to learn from.

044651506X|2.0|Plum Island enhances NOT Mr. DeMille's well-deserved reputation as an acclaimed novelist- whether in Spencerville, The Charm School, et. al.  And many reviewers praise this current work with such laudatory paragraphs as to convince anyone understanding the reviewing business that they have not read the book.  Instead of trudging through it, word for word, the well known habit of reading the book jacket, glancing through the chapters, perusing the introduction and conclusion, and reminding themselves of the author's past laurels has incapacitated the reviewers from penetrating the reality of Plum Island. &quot;His skills still work at top levels, his sentences show grain like fine wood work, his dialogue has much human layering, and each page carries a deep gloss.  His plot gathers speed until it sings.&quot;! !  [Exclamation points are mine].  I rest my case.  In a nutshell, Plum Island (New York) is a reputable, potentially interesting First Draft.  The idea of biological and nuclear accidents is compelling, as is the interconnection with archaeological digs, a range of potential murderers, and a few diabolical CIA types.  But the author drags the whole thing out, substituting sloppy plot arrangements, drawn-out and laborious progression, confusing complexity of though and plot, unnecessary and irrelevant detail for reasonable complexity of thought and plot.  Ponder for a moment the book jacket's blurb from the Philadelphia Inquirer (which raises serious questions about that person's lack of talent.One suspects DeMille got caught up with his words, decided the book would not sell if it did not &quot;last&quot; for 500 pages, and went on vacation before submitting a decent finished draft.

0446364495|3.0|I'd give it a six except I've been intimidated by all of the extremely negative reviews.  But, let's be honest, the great title alone makes it better than a '1'.<br />  Actually, I saw the movie and later read the book.  The movie was better; after all it had Streep and Eastwood.  I thought it wasn't a bad love story.  Many people go through life denying some of their intimate needs.

The book, which I read after seeing the film, was a great disappointment. I agree with most of the negative comments on this page. The fact the story itself has attracted such vehemently opposing views, however, does show that Waller's story has touched a nerve with the public.

B000002H2H|5.0|Released on November 23 1984, Metallica's second offering has stood the test of time to become one of the best thrash metal albums ever released, surpassed only by their following album &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and possibly Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;.<br /> On an album which contained no poor track a number of the songs remain on the bands live setlist to this day. Tracks such as &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; and &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; show Metallica at their blistering best, while other songs such as the ballad &quot;Fade to Black&quot; display Metallica's ability to write good slower and more melodic tunes. &quot;Creeping Death&quot; , a personal favourite, more or less defines the thrash metal genre while &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; shows that heavy doesn't necessairly mean fast. The final cut &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; is one of the hightlights of the album. An instrumental, which was written by Metallica and former band member and present frontman for Megadeth, was supposedly inspired by HP Lovecraft novels. <br /> Overall this album formed one of the cornerstones in trash/speed metal genre, and to anyone who likes that particular type of music and doesn't already have this album, then rush out and buy it now!!  <br /> Diarmuid   END

You have to read the sequel &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; To see if Rincewind survives.  Just a quick note: Try to control yourself on public transport, people don't understand if you are laughing on your way to work.

The second time I broke down and bought it (I read mostly library books).  Get it in hardback so it'll keep its shape after so many readings, and so many passing-along to friends and family.

This attitude most certainly explains my reaction to the book:  If you throw out the first 200 pages of the book, you have a good book; if you throw out the first 250 pages, you have an excellent book.

0812550706|5.0|Excuse me, but I beg to differ with some of the people who reviewed this book as a &quot;3&quot;.  Some of them provided substantial reasons as to why they didn't like it.  Most others simply insulted the reviewers who gave this book a 10 as being slow witted and not recognizing the flaws in the book that they see.  This book was very simple, yet it had a good story.  I've read too many books where the authors try to cover up their weak plot by using a vocabulary so extensive that the average American will simply decide that the book was written by someone much more bright than they are and that it is way over their heads.  They think it must be a good book but they just aren't intelligent enough to see the beauty of it.  Let me relieve all of those people out ther:There is no beauty to it.  Just because you have to train your mental abilities to grasp what turns out to be a weak mediocre imitation of a good story does not make it a good book.  Ender's Game had such a strong, involving plot that it didn't need 500 extra pages of confusing garbage to cover up its mistakes.  There were very few if any flaws in Ender's game if any.  Ender's game had nothing to hide and tried to hide nothing nothing.  That makes it all the better a story.  Almost everyone can easily identify with one of the people in the book.  I think the best part of this book was its simplistic view of things.  It was a d*mn good book in every way.  If you agree or disagree with me, I'd be obliged to recieve an e-mail message. Just to show you that I have nothing to hide, I would like to say taht I am 13 years of age, yet I think that had no apparent affect on my perception of this book.

0060926317|3.0|I read this book purely as a fiction, as some of the other reviews suggested.  I tried not to get into the debate over the possible exploitation of the aboriginals for the author's own success (although I found the debate interesting).  As a fiction, the book was a fun, easy read, with lessons we all know but are in need of constant reminding.  I was, however, disturbed when reading &quot;The Road From Coorain&quot; an autobiography by Jill Ker Conway published in 1989.  The very first chapter described kangaroos as being from 2 to 8 feet tall and ranging in color from a soft dove grey to a reddish color (or something like that).  Wasn't there a very, very similar description in &quot;Mutant Message&quot;?  I am just curious, but not enough to look it up word for word.
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book after every other member of  my family had read almost the entire series, and they were constantly making references I couldn't understand.  I'm so glad I did.  Ender's Game is a riveting and poignant tale of a boy who is made to grow up far too fast, for the sake of winning a war.  If there is a theme to the story (which is uncertain, although its sequels certainly have themes), it has to do with the terrible loss of innocence, and what men are capable of doing to themselves, as well as to others, when they hate what they don't understand.<br /> When my sister, an English graduate student who's been teaching reading for the past several years, first read the book, she noted that it's among the best ever written, and recommended it highly to her students.  I fully agree.  It's kind of a shame that the sequels to this wonderful novel, while being good works in themselves, are not nearly so riveting, and more difficult to get through.  But I suppose not every book can be the sort that this one is--where one fully intends to go to bed at 11:00 PM, and ends up going to bed at 4:00 AM, due to being utterly unable to put the book down.

0679731725|5.0|The Remains of the Day is the portrait of a culture in decline.  This is the England that has fascinated, amused and bewildered Americans for well over a hundred years: the England of great Halls encompassing great families, of dignity, decorum and stiff upper lips, of afternoon tea and evening port, of endless nattering over details that tilt the balance of the world. <br /> Stevens the Butler manages a diminishing staff at Darlington Hall with (he fears) diminishing competence.  When the narrative opens, the Darlington family has fallen on hard times and their ancestral Hall has been transferred--along with Stevens--to the proverbial rich American, Mr. Farraday.  Farraday suggests a vacation for his butler, an unprecedented idea that receives an impetus through the mail.  Miss Kenton was formerly the housekeeper at Darlington Hall and the closest thing to a &quot;friend&quot; that Stevens ever had until she gave up her position for a husband and family.  Now she writes, hinting at some dissatisfaction with her life and a desire to return to her former post.  Or is Stevens merely imagining these intimations?  He determines to pay a visit to her in the course of his south country tour and ferret out the truth.  <br />  So the journey is defined and its goal determined;  a voyage of self-discovery.  But as Stevens motors on through the quietly beautiful English countryside, his mind resists the broadening influence of travel and continues to circle Darlington Hall, turning over memories with meticulous detail and banal observation.  These memories reveal much more to the reader than they do to Stevens himself, who seems impervious to revelation.  The fine old English virtures--restraint, self-possession, rationality--have eaten into him with the unthinking viciousness of parasites, and by the middle of the journey a light dawns on the reader: perhaps there is no self here to discover. It's no coincidence that Stevens never discloses his first name.  <br />  Britain is also struggling with identity, after a three-century rise to world domination that produced, as its signature achievement, the likes of Darlington Hall and the sort of life that &quot;only  Americans can afford now.&quot;  A great and notable tradition has sunk into a caricature of itself, outdated at best and, at worst, sinister.  The late Lord Darlington, whom Stevens served for 35 years, was a sterling specimen of his time and class and, not incidentally, a dupe of the pre-war Nazis.  His name has come under such a cloud that Stevens is unable to claim it.  Three times, like Peter, he  denies his Lord--when asked, he disavows any relationship with the man.  Does this make a sham of his proud profession?  Stevens skirts the question, but can't bring himself to confront it.  <br />  Or to confront anything else, including Miss Kenton (now Mrs. Benn).  Their long-awaited meeting opens subterranean sores; in the most understated, unimpeachable manner their regard for each other is made clear at last, now that it's far too late to do anything about it.  To the unceasing cliches that have peppered his observations throughout the book, Stevens adds one more: &quot;Indeed--why should I not admit it--my heart was breaking.&quot;  At that moment,  we understand how  much of this honorable life was squandered on mere show.  <br />  The show, of course, was supposed to reflect what was underneath, and indeed it does: the ideal of British virtue that claimed everything Stevens has, now bankrupt.  The evening of life is all that's left to him, and the Empire--the Remains of the Day.  Still time to quit one ideal and find a new one.  Will he?  Can he? <br />  Not likely.

0802130208|4.0|You know, usually I wouldn't write a review like this, usually I wouldn't comment on anyone else's statements on a book, but hell, let's be honest: everyone who wrote anything about this book is either a benighted moron, or a cruel, vicious little person who gets off reading about other people's misery.      Most of the reviews are great, raving and ranting about the book's excellence.  yes, it's a good book.  But it is also a very sad book.  Most reviews talk about 'laugh out loud funny' and other cliched buzz phrases and it just doesn't apply to this book.  Sure, you may laugh at something here or there within, crack a smile, a grin, a hearty, wicked chortle.  But the book is about a fat, sick, crazy lunitic who's too smart and too paranoid and convinced that everyone in the world is out to get him.  Not the basis for hilarity, is it.  Sure, it could be made hilarious, with rampant exaggeration and skillfully making the character tremendously unlikeable, thereby changing the novel into a vicious comedy ripping this loser apart.  But Toole clearly felt affection towards his character.  He wanted things to turn out all right for him, but, based on his grounding the story in reality, that just didn't seem the way things should go.  It is not a comedy.  It is a tragedy with few moments of humor to lift the character's (and perhaps the reader's, but what writer really cares while writting a book what a general audience will think?)spirits or to give him a chance at laughing at himself and thereby restore some sense of humanity.      As for the people angry and disappointed that they didn't find the book funny--don't listen to what people say about anything, chances are you'll disagree.  Haven't you learned that by now?
0684874350|3.0|I was born and raised in Limerick and lived there until I was 27, as was my Father. Limerick may not be Paris but neither is it what the author describes it as. Yes there was and probably still is poverty but Limerick is a relatively modern and progressive city with mostly middle class residents who work in the electronics sector. My Father lived near Limerick during the same period as the author and did not come from a wealthy family and had tough times, including the death of 2 siblings, but also many more good times and fondly remembers his youth. He worked hard in the city and finally moved to one of the 'big houses on the Ennis Road'. Limerick and the surrounding region has much to offer and should not be judged by authors skewed memories...
0399142851|3.0|It was a relief to get Dr. Scarpetta back after the awful &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot;, but this book certainly doesn't measure up to her earlier work.<br />  I find it absolutely unbelievable that Dr. Scarpetta would be allowed to leave the isolation unit that quickly.  It also bothers me that one of the victims, who is 52 years old, is described as &quot;elderly&quot;.  Excuse me?  If a realistic time line were followed in these novels, Dr. Scarpetta herself would be 50 or very close to that.  It seems an author's vanity to have the main character remain ever young and sexy, while her niece ages by approximately l5 years!  If Cornwell wants us to believe Kay is one hot mama, she ought to keep Lucy at age l5!

0385311400|5.0|To me this was a book about fatherhood.  I was absolutely touched to the heart by the story and depth of character development.  I am stunned that some people have not found this to be Ms. Gabaldon's greatest achievement thus far.  I attribute some of this reaction to the fact that reader's who have fallen in love with a character may not like to see them change.  But Jamie and Claire have developed as souls before our eyes in this amazing series.  We've seen Jamie grow from a young and innocent young man into a mature and concerned father.  (Well, sometimes he's mature and sometimes he's a typical, stuborn Scottish dad!)  And I love the story of Bree and Roger.  These two converging plot lines demonstrate Ms. Gabaldon's tremendous talent.  I really enjoyed her exploration of the theme of fatherhood.

031286504X|4.0|This is the only vampire novel I've found that brings the myth into the modern world, not only through science-fiction science, but with the modern state of politics and society.

The suspense does wane at the end, but this is a satisfying book to read and re-read.
0449227421|4.0|Recently, a friend of mine lent me her copy of Follett's &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot;  It was basically a good read, although I had to struggle to keep my attention focused through much of the political/religious stuff.  When &quot;Third Twin&quot; came out, I decided to check it out.  I couldn't believe it was written by the same author! &quot;Twin&quot; was so much faster, more enjoyable, and less bogged down than &quot;Pillars&quot;.  While I will admit that the characters and the plot were not quite as fully developed, I believe that adds to the charm of the book.  I don't know about the rest of you, but after a long day at school and work, the last thing I want to do is read twenty pages about the ongoing angst between a priest and a monk.  I read for entertainment, and &quot;Third Twin&quot; was pure entertainment.  I liked it so much that I am lending it back to the friend who first tuned me in to Follett.
0316921173|5.0|I had not heard of this book prior to purchasing it.  I was unaware of the hype or the reviews.  It called out to me from the shelves of my local book store, so I bought it.  Now I am hooked.  I have read the book cover to cover twice.  I have had to hold myself back from starting it again.  In fact I may need the assistance of a 12 step program to stop reading this book.  Much like the &quot;entertainment&quot; it describes, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is addictive. The voice and story of each of the main characters is unique and engaging.  Do not be put off by the size of this book.  I have since found out that the authors original draft included 500 additional pages.  I want those pages.  Don't expect the book to answer all of the questions it asks. You will find some of the answers if you look hard enough.  Be prepared to be drawn into a intricate world that seems as real as our own.

When I watched the 3 The Godfather movies (and I saw them several times as well), thought the book was -and indeed it is- much better than the movies. If  you think family values are important in life you  should read The Godfather and so you will find out Corleone family values, delighting the way they love each other. The writing style and deep values of life are revealed in Mario Puzo's novels. I recommend also his book: &quot;Salvatore Giuliano: The Sicilian&quot;.

The way the book is written makes me believe that I am there with Frank and Malachy.  This was one of the greatest books I have read in a great while.  What I could say about this book does not do justice to it.  This is a book that you must read in order to get the full effect of how great it really is.  It is one of the all time best. The money spent on this book was well worth it.  Hurrah to Frank McCourt for such a finely written memoir...
6302732778|4.0|After seeing the Original release and then the Director Cut, I was a little disappointed.  The DC lacks the original voice-over by Ford that (imo) adds some sort of connection between the scenes.  The DC does have some extra footage that makes in worth viewing but not that much and the ending of the DC is different.  I believe that Blade Runner is still a great movie but I would have rather seen much more of the cut footage (like Decker visiting Holden in the hospital - a scene that is not in any released version) with the voice-over (narration by Ford).  Still it is worth watching and maybe adding to your collection.   END
0880389052|5.0|I read this book a while ago.  Since then I've read many other fantasy novels, there is no compare.  You purists may not like to hear this, but this book is better than even J.R.R. Tolkien!  Yes, you heard me right.  The character of Drizzt Do' Urden is unlike any other character in any fantasy novel.  The novel shows us how one individual in a race consumed by evil is able to be different and resist the darkside. I can draw comparisons to Star Wars in that they both show the overcoming of an invincible evil. Unlike most fantasy novels, there are many real life themes in Salvatore's Dark Elf trilogy.  Besides the usual good vs evil, you have the question of racism discussed and how you are stereotyped because of the actions of others.  All of these themes that you would expect in a real-life novel, you see them in an entertaining fantasy setting.  The great writing was continued in Salvatore's subsequent Drizzt novels (though he does kind of descend into the usual swords and sorcery that all of us have seen before).  Now you may be wondering why I included the but.... in my summary, well I will tell you.  R.A. SALVATORE IS NO LONGER WRITING DRIZZT NOVELS!  I don't know what the problem was?  Maybe TSR was giving him grief, I don't know, but Drizzt by any other man just isn't Drizzt.  PLEASE SALVATORE, WRITE MORE DRIZZT NOVELS!

0553565915|5.0|I have read Betty's book and it changed my life.  I approached this book from a totally atheistic point of view.  Before that I had read &quot;saved by the light&quot; by Dannion Brinkly and that book perked my interest in the subject but I was very skeptical.  But after reading 4 more books on the near death experience by doctors, researchers, nurses, and the experiencers them selves, I am totally convinced that this is a true phenomena.  Those Christians who want to criticize Betty.  Are following the Bible too strictly.  They are no different than the Pharisees.  Or the other Jews who said Jesus was not the messiah. You must keep an open mind and not fear new and different things.  You must look into your heart for the truth.  You can use material books like the Bible as a guide but only you can know god.  Is Betty or the other experiencers any different than the Christians of old who had mystical experiences. Why can't one have these kinds of experiences now?  And if god is ready to reveal a new truth to us how will we recognize it if we are closed to everything that is different than our past knowledge.  You must have an open mind as well as a skeptical one.  Stop blindly following the text of the bible or any book, it's not like you really fully understand it's meaning anyway.  I have discovered that my lack of an open mind has been my biggest blockage to the truth.  Fear is the enemy, love is our savior. That's all there is to it.  Anyway, I Highly recommend the book. END

B0000020C4|5.0|With a stellar cast culled from the various productions of what is now &quot;The Most Popular Musical in the World,&quot; this recording soars loftily -- far above all the albums that has preceded it.<br />Colm Wilkinson once again voices the character of Jean Valjean.  His tenure with the role and his years of hiatus from performing Valjean onstage lends his concert rendition both an element of pristine freshness and the quality of superbly aged wine.<br />  Phillip Quast, who wasThenardier in the Original London Cast, now plays  Javert.  His &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;Javert's Suicide&quot; surprisingly depicts Javert as human;  his characterization is deeply moving.  The ill-fated Fantine is sang by Ruthie Henshall, who has both the crystalline voice of the actor who had originated the role on Broadway and the aria-power of Patti Lupone (Original London Les Miz, Evita).  As the only actor who incorporates a Parisienne accent in this concert, she adds a unique feel to the recording.<br />  Lea Salonga, London and Broadway's Miss Saigon, is easily the most memorable Eponine ever.  Her emotional clarion is unsurpassed as she wrenches her heart out in the various solos, duets and counter-points that she sings.  Michael Ball (London's Original Marius) and Judy Kuhn (Original Broadway Cast, and Disney's animated Pocahontas) excellently captures the turmoil and confusion of passion which they successfully crystallize to love.<br />The ensemble of over 250 people led by Michael Maguire (Enjolras in Original Broadway Production) makes this recording a definite must-have.  Rather that being merely another soundtrack, this album is an experience in itself.   END
0312857063|5.0|Everybody has read the kind of books that keep you wanting more after you have finished it. This on  was like that for me. The action and  battle scenes are graphic but graceful. The sexual content is very tastefully done and doesn,t get tawdry. The characters are beleivable and realist in their actions. I was a bit put off by the size of the book(over 900 pages), but the only thing that matches it is the scope of the book. The only other series that matches this is the Deryni titles by K. Kurtz. There is only good news coming in the fact that the story isn't over, look for &quot;The Blood of the Fold&quot;, and more. They should have done a better job with the maps though. It's hard to follow the paths fo the characters because some of the cities and landmarks are not shown. If the publisher is reading this maybe they can do something about it in future offerings. Some of us really like maps.

0385486804|5.0|Into the Wild is an extraordinary read. This book is for all who love to explore nature as well as for all couch-bound souls who do not embark on adventures but still nevertheless are intrigued by those who do. A Wyoming girl who loves the outdoors and at times loathes the overwhelming nature of today's materialistic society, I found that Into the Wild was riveting and curious.   Into the Wild is a story about a young man who followed his soul in an attempt to find it. It's a true account of a young man whose ideals were fulfilled once he set his soul free and followed a path into the wild.   Into the Wild provides its readers with a &quot;safe&quot; way of exploring their own lives and curiosities and reminds us that the answers to our soul's burning questions cannot be answered, but found.  What readers get from Into the Wild is not a story about a young man's death, but rather a story about a young man's &quot;life&quot; and his willingness to explore it.  Call Chris McCandless a stupid idealist or a brave heart. Either way, the reader becomes to know this young man while enjoying this story's mystery, exploration and truth. Krakauer is brilliant!
0679450254|5.0|I have been haunted and rejuvenated by the story of Chris McCandless.  K's style is lucid and  interweaves larger topics, such as the personal odyssey youth seeks.  Pure luck has saved many of us who pursued similar misadventures in our adolescence.  K is adept at scraping at raw nerve endings.  On one hand, McCandless suffered from hubris, but that characteristic might very well be an indicator of someone with &quot;risk genes.&quot;  If McCandless had survived by a whisker, we would have admired his &quot;cool.&quot;  It appears his style was to live on an edge that the Walter Mittys of this world will never fathom. There is more to life than growing old. My thanks to Jon Krakauer for generating a body of work that acknowledges a tragic tradition. One that can be traced back to the &quot;5,000 year old man.&quot;

After reading this book I felt like a complete jerk for feeling so sorry for myself compared to what these people had gone through.  I read the book again in 1983 when I was fighting cancer and dealing with radiation treatments.  As I read the book this time, it gave me the courage to face my adversity and realize that no matter how tough you think life is, you can make it.  It showed me the importance of never quiting and always believing in oneself, and in that, the sweetness of life.  I highly recomend this book to anyone that needs a lift.

0440131480|5.0|Goodbye Blue Monday or Breakfast of Champions outrageously funny, provocatively clever, and just an all around pleasant page-turner. The spiritual journey that Mr. Vonnegut takes us on is poignantly authentic, while at the same time ribaldly funny.  Mr. Vonnegut, on the precipice of suicide (real or virtual), engages in a protracted orgy of cathartic blood-letting, a purging of the flotsam and jetsam of what passes for culture in this disneyland of a country of ours, that has collected in the drain pan of his consciousness. It's an Irish wake on acid, and along the way Mr. Vonnegut experiences an unexpected epiphany (real or virtual) in the person of one of his creations, the painter Rabo Karabekian.  Karabekian teaches Mr. Vonnegut that Homo sapiens do in fact possess some sanctity in the guise of our awareness, expressed by Karabekian in his painting, &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony,&quot; as &quot;an unwavering band of light.&quot;  Unwavering in the sense that, even with all of the cockymamied crapshoot contretemps that constitutes life on this planet, we remain sentient.  In the process of defending his painting in a Holiday Inn cocktail lounge to some of the outraged citizens of Midland City, which has purchased the painting for an ridiculously exorbitant sum, Karabekian saves Mr. Vonnegut's life.  Along the way we are treated to Mr. Vonnegut's drawings of some ofthe offal that that passes for American culture that he's trying empty his head of.  This novel is anything but--it's a clarion call for sanity in an increasingly insane world.  We should listen.

The sugar-coated biographies of Mother  Teresa leave readers with a strangely sick after  taste, yet Hitchens refreshes us with his tart take  on this modern icon. My 12 year old daughter was so taken by it that she decided to write a  controversial Mother Teresa bashing editorial for her school newspaper!
0671688782|5.0|Personally knowing several parents who have successfully used this method, I want to report that it can accomplish all the subtitle claims. Both mothers and children are pleased with the results and want to continue.  This is not an abusive method, but a deeply loving one, staying with your child through their &quot;ugliest&quot; feelings and then sharing a closeness never before achieved because of the parent's acceptance of those feelings. However, if a parent is frightened by the thought of doing Holding Time, they should probably have help from a therapist or someone who has done it successfully with their own children.  And if a parent believes it is abusive, they don't understand what it's all about and had better find other ways to parent their children. Too bad, because this one can truly work &quot;miracles.&quot;

The thickness of the book is daunting, but you'll find as you curl up with it over a nice, warm mug of tea that you won't want to stop reading about Arthur, Merlin, Vivane, and Morgana.   I sure hope you pick it up because this book is a must for anyone who ever believed in Camelot.

0385486804|2.0|Having read only newspaper accounts of McCandless' Ultimate Adventure, and having NOT read Krakauer's account in Outside Magazine, I was very much looking forward to learning more about why (and how) a smart and enthusiastic young man came to such a sad and early death.  I have to say that I was greatly disappointed in what the book had to offer.  By page 150 of 207 total pages I felt I had learned enough about McCandless'  father, mother, sister, cousin, high shool teammates, road buddies, Important Formative Experiences, and Krakauer's own post-adolescent feelings of alienation, angst and invincibility.  'Tell me what happened in Alaska' I said over and over.  Sadly, there is just not that much to tell. Having wandered off unprepared, McCandless got into a bind and couldn't get out of it.  The book suffers from extensive padding with anecdotes of marginal interest, profiles of what seems like every person McCandless ever met and a parade of lengthy quotes (mostly from Thoreau) at the start of nearly every chapter. Krakauer does develop a good account of what McCandless was trying to do, and I found his position that McCandless was not a whacko with a death wish entirely credible.  But the story could be told, and probably was, in a more tightly organized and concise magazine article.  For those interested in the difficulties and consequences of adventuring in northern latitudes, I can reccomend two far more interesting and informative books: 'Tundra', edited by Farley Mowat and especially 'Disappearences: A Map' by Shiela Nickerson.  These volumes use journals from expeditions and travels of the prepared and unprepared to tell part of the history and difficult reality of surviving and failing to survive in an unforgiving environment.
0893815187|5.0|All of the photographs in this collection were taken with an 8x10 view camera, even those that have the appearance of candid, random snapshots. Many of the images are carefully manipulated in the darkroom to give one of the subjects an eerie, almost angelic luminescence in scenes dominated by hardship, tragedy, and crushing rural poverty. Sally Mann is a major artist, supported by Guggenheim, NEH and NEA grants, and this is some of her very best work. Readers should be warned that some will consider this work to border on child pornography. While this is absolutely not the case (and I vigorously support prosecution of those who exploit children in any fashion), in some localities this could almost be a &quot;dangerous&quot; book to own. Sally Mann's disturbing and transcendent vision will outlast our current hysteria and misunderstanding and will endure as photographic literature.
0671004107|4.0|I think this book is in several ways very similar to the Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, in that there is a very simple plotline inside which conflict of ideas takes place. It is truly a book about ideas. Additionally, Eco and Sagan use in my opinion the same brand of irony in that many of the characters show examples of vast ineptitude at their jobs. Unfortunately, I read the book only after seeing the movie (and I hold the movie as one of the finest ever made,) but I felt that the book did not live up to its vast potential as the basis of that movie. Both Forrest Gump and Contact focused on a central character, but were driven by auxillary characters; I don't feel that Sagan had fleshed out his characters nearly as well as they were delivered in the movie, which is unusual for a book/movie comparison. If you have seen the movie, I would reccommend the book *only if* you seek more depth on the science component of the story.

0553573403|5.0|This is one of the few books in any genre that I have re-read and on second reading it was as absorbing, thrilling and exciting as the first time.  The sequel is too far in the reader's future!  Please hurry, but then again, a quality book is worth waiting for.  Better than Jordan's Wheel of Time, an example of what happens when not enough time occurs between one book and the next or when a publisher won't let an author end it. Martin is an author who can allow the reader to learn about and care about his characters, their situations, and their very tenuous futures.  They cease to be a figment of his imagination and become a fabric of a reader's life.  When I read the first Wheel of Time, I was discussing with a fellow devotee (both of us having faded away after  book 3) who we would have playing the roles in the movie of the century.  The same theme runs through the mind with A Game of Thrones.  I will buy multiple copies of this paperback to distribute to my fellow movie-theme readers.  Bravo, Martin!  Keep up the terrific work.
0880381736|2.0|Admittedly, this series did help quite a bit to bring fantasy fiction into the mainstream.  But, that is about all it accomplishes.  This series is full of the cockie-cutter stereotypes that most fantasy fiction is founded upon.  The authors' grasp of their own details is shaky at best.  It is rather obvious that Margret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman had very little practical knowledge about historically accurate medieval times.  The characters sleep in their armor, even in the dead of winter?      I must also admit that TSR novels are largely what I was weaned on as a young reader.  But, to continue the medaphor, one will find that mother's milk tastes increasingly sour as one ages.  Has the milk changed?  No.  The drinker has only gained a more refined pallatte.

A huge part of the fun in this book is trying to guess where it's going -- and being outsmarted by Martin again and again.

0452277752|5.0|The Bachman Books, four short novels written by Stephen King in the late 70's under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, feature King at his pinnacle as a storyteller.  He used the pen-name to exhibit a grittier, more controlled, more literal style of writing.  Each story is different in tone and texture but all deal with the recurring theme of endurance . . . either physical or mental or both.  Here's a run down on each one:      RAGE   A story so good it allegedly spawned an actual copycat killing of the same nature in Spokane, Washington in 1996.  In it, a student hovering on the edge of madness walks into class one day with a gun and shoots his teacher dead and holds the class hostage.  What ensues is a dead-on examination of the brutal teen Moulinex known as high school.  While the cast of characters may seem like cliches, with the jock, the pretty-girl, and the school slut, each one is fully fleshed-out into a living, breathing person.  And as our narrator takes his classmates along the winding path of parental neglect that leads to the incident, it's the best kind of writing where you know the author is exorcising his own personal demons.      THE LONG WALK   A science-fiction tale, but as usual with King's dabbles in this genre, it has less to do with science and more to do with the human condition.  In the near future (this I'm assuming, as SK doesn't let such minor details like the actual date get in the way of the storytelling), 100 young men are entered in a footrace called The Long Walk.  The winner gets anything his heart desires.  The losers get death.  It's like a pedestrian \\"Speed\\" . . . if your pace drops below 4 mph four times, they shoot you.  In this closed microcosm, the contestants form bands of friendships, which slowly shake apart as the road takes its toll on them.  As we near the end of the line, we're almost as physically and emotionally exhausted as the walkers themselves.      ROADWORK   A clinical study of quiet insanity.  Barton Dawes is aman with a nice house, good job and a loving wife.  But he throws it all away when construction of a highway extension tags his house for demolition, along with the memories of his young son who lived and played and then died there, of a brain tumor.  The sense of dread and inevitability as Dawes lets his responsibilities to his wife and co-workers swirl down the drain is almost palpable, and the ending is nothing short of cathartic as Dawes confronts the city bureaucrats with a little roadwork on his own terms.      THE RUNNING MAN   Don't let the god-awful movie colour your opinion on the story on which it was \\"based\\", this is a lean, mean chase-thriller which also deals with the themes of mankind's lust for blood, a government out of control, and the struggle of an underclass society.  Another psuedo-science-fiction tale, a man runs for his life on a futuristic game-show run by an all-powerful 'free-vee' network out to pacify society and rid itself of possible troublemakers.  King tries a little harder with the SF elements in this one, creating an oppressive environment choking on its own commercialized excess.  But as runner Ben Richards keeps one step ahead of the hunters, the quiet nobility of a disenfranchised society risking all to aid him gives hope to the future in the novel.      So, despite an undertone of gleeful racism throughout the stories, the novels hold the same incredible power even 20 years after they were first published.  Stephen King has rarely been as adept at boldly prying up the lid of society and showing us the worms of insanity wriggling below.
0425156842|2.0|Frustrating! While enlightening in weaving the historical thread of philosophy, the story which frames this mini-course is frail, erratic and finally ludicrous.

0930289234|5.0|Comic art at its highest elevation, and yet calling it a comic seems to trivialize it.  A must for any comic devotee, thoroughly entertaining to any peripheral comic fan (like me) and of interest to just about anyone else--if you like great writing, great art, history, gothic literature or black humor, you'll find something here.  A little on the violent side, but on the other hand, this is serious subject matter that can't be glossed over.  Excellent character development--no one is all good or all bad, and that's what makes it real.
0679457313|4.0|Arundhati Roy, the diminutive and brilliant author of The God of Small Things, was quoted as saying that her writing was like breathing, and, to paraphrase, therefore she could not change a word of it.  The Booker Prize winning book, then, is a first draft.  Perhaps that explains both its lyrical immediacy and it linguistic inconsistencies.  Its metaphors often have the mystical clarity of dream fragments, yet often her quirks are mystifying.  Often while reading I was asking things like:  why is this capitalized and not that?  Well, now I know.  But it doesn't bother me--enough craft is enough, and these days it's all too often exceedingly evident in novels. If Roy can be criticized for her 'automatic writing', perhaps it's for not choosing the best format for it, for instance prose poetry (see the incredible City Terrace Field Manual by Sesshu Foster, a book that also evokes place with powerful lyrical passages, this time the place being East L.A.).  In the end, though, Roy's book is a pleasure, more insights than inconsistencies, more originality than indulgence.
0345389409|3.0|<br />Basically Memnoch is extremely well written  as all of Anne Rice's books are, however the story line is not that interesting if you are looking for a Lestat thriller.  Overall I enjoyed the book because it dealt with God and the Devil and Rice's thoughts on their relationship.  <br />I would love to read a Vampire Chronicle starring Louis.  Louis is a wonderful character.  Although we all love Lestat, a change  would be great.
0380778556|5.0|Haunting and beautifully crafted, Rebecca is a book you will return to again and again.  Perhaps the last true example of the &quot;Gothic&quot; tradition, this book was the basis for the beloved Hitchcock film.  Memorable as the film is, the novel is deeper, richer, and more rewarding with each reading.  Not to miss by anyone who loves a good story, gripping characters, mystery, and the masterful usage of the English language.

0515071439|5.0|I've read almost all of Ira Levin's works, and this is definitely my favorite.  Simply written, yet deeply clever, this book will draw you into the antagonist's brilliant and greedy plan, and it won't let you go.  I read it in a day and a half.  Please don't be dissuaded by the two horrible movies based on this book. I give the book a 9, and the movies a 1.5.  This book will not dissappoint!
0345315227|1.0|I read 2001,2010, and 2061 and loved them. Great ideas, good detail, and lots of rich storytelling. I had lots of fun reading them. Then I read 3001:the final Odyssey and almost gagged. THIS WAS BAD.   Imagine the possibilities of the future they hint at as a lake. 3001 barely skims the surface. It's also poorly written and slow. What a step down. It's hard to imagine that Arthur C. Clark, the incredible guy who wrote the other three, wrote this.   3001 has the worst, most unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending I have ever read. As I neared the end of the book, I thought &quot;I hope the ending is better than the rest of this...thing.&quot; As it turned out, it was the worst part.   This book isn't even in the same style as the other ones. It has a more arrogant, emotionless, less detailed and more distant view and telling.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Even a few good ideas (like the massive space station that wraps itself all the way around earth high in orbit) can't save this dud. If you are looking for a good read, don't even peek at this. Go read the unabridged version of &quot;The Stand&quot; instead.

006016848X|4.0|While some believe the premise in John Gray's &quot;Mars/Venus&quot; is overly-simplistic, the best advice is advice that's easy to use, clear and makes sense.  Relationships are already complex enough.  I read &quot;Mars/Venus&quot; two years ago and it has revolutionized my relationships.  One of the best things about this book is it's breezy style with a touch of humor which makes it easy for people to read with an open mind.  If you've had difficulty getting your partner to read a &quot;relationship book&quot; they will read this book.  My boyfriend of three months is reading it now and thoroughly enjoying it.  We're able to laugh at how we fall into certain dialogue patterns similar to examples in the book.  To those who contend Gray puts more of the responsibility for relationship success on the woman's shoulders, I would respond by saying 35 years of feminism does not change thousands of years of human conditioning.  Many relationship books offer more detailed and complicated advice and techniques, but the genius of Gray's ideas are subtlely hidden in their simplicity.
0679441018|1.0|<br />Does Anne Rice stand behind her work? If so, she should personally give everyone a refund who did not like this book. First, Lestat sits in a bar and learns the personal history of a ghost; then we get a tour of hell and Memnoch's explanation of creation (and all that angel heirarchy....stop!). I ended up sympathetic towards Memnoch and didn't give a damn about Lestat. Somebody tell me why Lestat was in this story. I felt like I was reading Rice's interpretation of creation. I want a story! And not an interpretation! Anne, stop writing and pursue a career in biblical studies, for Christ's sake!
006109594X|4.0|Patrick Robinson wrote Nimitz Class with the help of Sir Admiral Woodward who single-handedly commanded the first computor war this world has ever seen.  The Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1982.  He was the top man in the Royal Navy and every piece of technical jargon is absolutely spot on in Nimitz Class.     The book was spotted by Ed Victor (one of the most important literary agents in the world) who quickly became Mr. Robinson's London agent.  Nimitz Class has paid meticulous attention to detail, and the way Patrick Robinson writes places him among the best thriller writers of this century.  He blew Tom Clancy out of the water in the Italian literary awards this year, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It is a breath taking debut and I believe it really could be the news one day.  It has provoked wide military concern, and as a direct result of this book, no foreigner will ever be trained again in England - Ben Adnam scared the Royal Navy away from that idea.  Books that lack realism tend not to have the same international effect.   Jengo R.
0385424736|4.0|The book was drawn out uneccessarily. It has a great protangonist with other funny characters like Deck who will be played by Danny DeVito in the movie.

0316381357|5.0|The Nun's Story, by Kathryn Hulme, is not a book that can be read in one sitting, due not  only to its length but to the fact that the depth  of its contents requires the reader to take a deep breath after every paragraph. This touching story  tells the life of a young woman who tries  arduously to become a good nun. Although The Nun's  Story is not related to the majority of people's everyday lives, it demonstrates the beauty and the enchantment of a world which to many is a complete mystery.  The Nun's Story is absorbing to the point  of tears, a novel in which it is quite impossible not to sympathize with the character. Although it  is said that Hulme's intentions were to criticize  and denounce convent life, the book in no way creates that sort of atmosphere. It simply shows to the world  a bit more about a very special world, and in all truth, this is done beautifully.

0671004107|5.0|<br />Carl Sagan's Contact is truly the most masterful work of literary art published in the twentieth century. The novel, originally published in 1985, and the posthumously released film that followed in 1997 are among the most fascinating and moving stories of all time. Human words can hardly describe the emotions, sensations, and fascinations triggered by reading this gripping book. Even the most skeptic and cynical reader will be forever touched by this enchanting novel. It mesmerizes a reader like no other novel can. <BR> <br />Contact is the only novel written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. He should have written more. He was the only man in all the years of his study of science to boost anyone's interest in this fascinating field to the extent that he did. I also strongly recommend his many other books, including Cosmos, Comet, Broca's Brain, and Pale Blue Dot, just to name a few.<BR> <br />Contact flawlessly debates and explains many prepossessing topics at once, all while telling a spellbinding story of the seemingly endless quest for truth. It is about the search for meaning and fidelity in our troubled lives. It gives us an answer to our questions about the constant battles between scientific proof and faith. Sagan predicts the future of the universe through this spectacular narrative. I'm happy with his answer.

0679457313|4.0|This is an inspiried memory of a childhood.  It opens with an impressionistic view of the place and then it shifts to a string of memories about a childhood as one of a pair of &quot;Two Egg Twins.  Roy leads us through this interesting landscape through the eyes of a  child.  She retains some of the childhood experience in her use of language.  She slams words together to show how a child hears Indian-English in phrases like &quot;Orangedrinklemondrinkman.&quot; In addition she tears words apart to show the innate dread of such  adult words as LAY TER, as in we'll talk about that LAY TER! While you are never sure of where in time the story lies,  you are lead to the conclusion about how a family destrioes itself and how the &quot;Two Egg Twins&quot; are injured at the core of their siamese soul.  This is not a treatise on India, only a human story like any other about the destructive forces of life.  A really good first novel.
0151001820|5.0|As in all the best mysteries, the final revelation -- Aristotle's 'anagnoris' -- is deferred until the very last sentence: &quot;And everyone gets the Devil they deserve.&quot; For Varo Borja, millionaire book dealer, he is the traditional horns-and-pitchfork being with highly desirable powers and a knack of cheating even his most ardent and erudite disciples just when they thought they were about to join in the devilry. For the protagonist, the Devil is a girl rising 20 with long limbs, an unseasonal tan and a knack, only lightly sketched in, for what men like Lucas Corso like most in a woman. Then there's another, equally convoluted plot line that gives the book its title. Intrigued? Then you'll gobble up this and its companion piece, The Flanders Panel, and be slightly irritated that Drumhead T and The Fencing Master won't be available until February and March next year. Turned off? Maybe Ed McBain is more your idea of a diabolical murder mystery.

0316920045|3.0|If an infinite number of monkeys at an infinite number of typewriters struck randomly on the keys for an infinite length of time, they would end up with the &quot;novel&quot; Infinite Jest.  Like Inifinite Jest, the monkeys would occasionally write something brilliant or hilarious, but mostly they would just write nonsense.  Wallace's book does have enough humor and insight to carry a determined reader through, however, I was left at the end thinking that noone has written so very much to say so very little.  For those of us readers who have not found Infinite Jest to be a work of &quot;genius&quot;, it is not that we all have a short attention span or that we just don't &quot;get it&quot;.  Many of us do get it, we just don't find it brilliant.  Most of the insights are not new or that profound, in fact I was stunned for such a supposedly &quot;insightful&quot; book how little true understanding of human nature was evident in the dialog or character construction.  For readers considering this book, if you enjoy long, occasional witty essays or writing for the sake of  form rather than content, you may love this book.  But if you are looking for fiction, with viable characters, and a worthwhile story to tell, search elsewhere.
0812550757|2.0|I'll explain by giving an example A sequel to this book could be this &quot;Ender goes back in time, saves John F. Kennedy, travels first to the moon, brings a Cure to Cancer, travels again through time and dies as Jesus&quot;. Ender does everything. It's so stupid. I really liked the first book, I would've given it a 9, but this..I think this book should never have been written.
0671004611|5.0|Remember when they just wheeled the ark into a secure storage site never to be seen again?  This is a book that should be on the front pages of every newspaper, TV and radio program.  There is no more significant story, as the implications for our political, moral and historical life schema are affected.  The ring of truth and matter of fact way it is presented should be honored as well.
006016848X|5.0|Anyone that has anything bad to say about this book is also probably wondering why they aren't having any luck in there relationships.. John Gray is very desisive when telling about how to communicate better between the sexes. While I found that he did place a little too much pressure for the relationship on the womans side he still made it very clear that we all need to learn how to communicate with the opposite sex better. <br />     If you learn anything from this you find that we are the same in some ways but in many we are not and you learn how to communicate to others the way you are diffrent and your thoughts and feelings. It also gives you a look from your partners point of view, When they usually wouldn't tell you what they were thinking you can now learn to convay to each other.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper Lee, is an excellent novel.  I found it touching, sorrowful, and humorous.  It is about two children's experiences with prejudice and racism as they grow and mature in a small southern town.  Their father, Atticus, is one of the few open minded people in Maycomb, their town.  He is appointed to judge a black man in a case where the black is charged with the rape of a white woman.  Even though Atticus does his very best, reason and truth can not hold out over racism and hatred.        However, the trial is not the only focus of the book.  Another important theme is that of &quot;Boo Radley,&quot; the town recluse, who has not been seen in years.  The children, Jem and Scout (Scout is Jem's little sister), are interested in seeing Boo, and try several times to give him a note or look in his shutters to see him.  At one point in the story, soap dolls and other presents show up in a knothole in a tree for the children.  One of the important parts of the story is when Scout and Jem see their father, Atticus, who they percieved as old and useless, shoot a mad dog that is coming down their street, thus learning that he &quot;was the deadest shot in Maycomb County in his day.&quot;        All in all, this book, with its themes of growth and maturity, hatred, pride, and love is one of the best that you could read.
0316920045|1.0|I would derive sincere pleasure in hunting down this Wallace character, wrapping him up in a burlap sack, and beating him senseless with a two by four.  His pedantic, painfully forced, prose makes text-books seem fun.  I should have known - whenever the word &quot;post-modern&quot; (a term that no one, not even its users, can define) is used to describe something, my eyebrow raises. I guess in the case of Infinite Jest post-modern means pretentious, awkward, and heartless.  Save yourself. . .put the book down and slowly walk away.
0812550706|5.0|When it comes to Sci-Fi novels, there are good writes, there are bad writers, and there is Orson Scott Card.  What distinguishes him from the rest is that he makes his characters strong and diligent.  They are believable in the context that they are placed.  He doesn't randomly pick traits from a hat, he gives birth to a new human being thats is unique in every way. And in Ender's Game, he has birthed a creature that is both all powerful, and weak.    Brilliantly written, engrossing and finely detailed, Ender's Game is a MUST for anyone who believes that childhood is something that should be held sacred.  And if you don't, well, read it anyway! :) It's a fun book, so don't judge it by its seriousness.
0345350499|5.0|The mists of avalon is rich in the mysterious magick of England and it's religion during the reign of King Arthur, when the pale of Christianity was just touching Britain.     it changes your mind, and perspective on many things in life . . . makes you see everything in a different light.  leaves you feeling wiser.
0517591812|2.0|After having made several trips to London, and always at a loss concerning the time-line of the history of the city, I really enjoyed the informal history lesson.....but the story line and characters were a bit boring and sophomoric.  At times, I wondered if parts of the book were really fiction or actual history.  Too bad some more definite differentiation could not have been made between the two.  I was specifically interested in knowing the dates that different neighborhoods were established, and when landmark buildings etc were built.  I still don't know if the dates given were fact or fiction.
0395078016|3.0|Mein Kampf details Hitler's course of action to revive his war- torn country. It is written with extreme confidence and persuasive ability. It is easy to see why other Germans were convinced that this plan would succeed. Hitler does not give a single hint of doubt that his plans will not work. He has an answer for everything. Some of his ideas are good, while others are extremely flawed. His argument in favor of racism is absurd. He seems to think that the world is composed of races of individuals that are in competition with each other and that we should all strive to ensure the survival of our race. I agree that we are all competitve to a certain degree. But I think that the competitiveness is on a person to person basis, not race against race.  A common misconception that people have about this book is that it is Satanic. There is not one single mention of Satanism or anything else Satanic in nature anywhere in this book. If anti-semitic thoughts are inherently Satanic, then many of the prominent religious leaders in America are also Satanic. I found it interesting that Hitler never says anything about killing Jews. You get the feeling that he is thinking that way, but he never directly says this.<br />This book is not always easy to read. I often had to read a paragraph a second time in order to fully understand exactly what Hitler was trying to convey to the reader.<br />Mein Kampf should serve as a lesson to all about what can happen when too much power is given to the wrong person.
0553573403|5.0|Many of favorite books are works of fantasy, but the genre as a whole suffers from a lack of imagination and originality (ironic, that!), and as a result I read relatively little fantasy.  I picked up TGoT because years ago I read Martin's Fevre Dream and liked it (even though I don't generally care for vampire novels).  There are many reasons why I should have disliked this book, but mainly: (1)I find needlessly long books distasteful.  I thought, for example, that Eddings's original Belgariad would have made a reasonable couple of books, but was much weakened by the dithering about that stretched it to four.  TGoT runs some 800 pages in the pbk edition - for the first volume alone!  (2) I dislike books told from a variety of viewpoints, particularly when the author keeps shifting back and forth from chapter to chapter. Too often this convention attempts to mask weaknesses in characterization or plotting.  Martin tells this story from multiple points of view - about eight, if I remember correctly.  So did I hate the book?  Obviously not, since I rated it a 10!  Length wasn't a problem since there is no fat in this novel - every chapter advances at least one of the plots.  The multiple points of view didn't bother me in practice because the voices are all distinct, and I became quite fond of several of the characters.  Martin also does several things that I find all too infrequently in fantasy fiction: his characters are not two dimensional, representing &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.  They are complex, and believable.  Some of the &quot;good guys&quot; I find rather distasteful, and some of the &quot;bad guys&quot; (one in particular) are among my favorite characters in the book.  Also, Martin presents us with a complicated, twisting plot that depends much more on good old-fashioned political intrigue than the usual trite Dark Power on the rise again (I get _very_ bored with &quot;Sauron Syndrome&quot;).  In both his complex characterizations and his Byzantine plotting, Martin's TGoT reminds me of some of the best of Glen Cook - although their writing styles otherwise are quite dissimilar.  I cannot remember the last time I reread a book within a few months of finishing it the first time, but I did with this one and found it just as gripping the second time around.ne plotting, Martin's TGoT reminds me of some of the best of Glen Cook - although their writing styles otherwise are quite dissimilar.

0671559850|5.0|One of the best hard-sf books written in the last 10 years. Not a novel in the pure sense of the word rather a series of linked short stories ( I believe originally published in various SF mags) about the travels  of one Haviland Tuf. Tuf a very large, very bald cat-loving trader becomes, through the misfortune of others, a genetic engineer.  The short stories detail both his sudden rise to this peculiar position, and his life afterwards. Recommended for any fan of hard-sf, cats, and DNA.
0380973634|5.0|This book was great!  It is true, as one of the other reviewers said, that the characters lack depth.  But so what!  It was still a fun read...and if I wanted depth, I could read Dostoevski!  I am delighted to find another author of this calabre..I no longer have to wait for Powers, de Lint, and Blaylock.  There is a new voice in fantastic lit!
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is what Alex was made into as a punishment for his crimes.  This left him without the freedom of choice, a product of the Government.  It also took from him his love of music and ability to act to defend himself in a cruel world.  The message I got from this book was that though individuals can be terrible, a Government can be even more terrible.  An excellent book for any hooligan who likes to wear real horrorshow bolshy big boots.
0385486804|4.0|Great Book except for 2 Chapters that Krakauer writes about himself. Overall though, it's an outstanding book that blows the article away that Krakauer wrote for Outside Magazine. Krakauer makes you feel like you're there.
0451169514|5.0|In years to come after Mr. King has been taken from us we will look back and say that this was his masterpiece.  The interlacing of the 2 story lines, past and present, and bringing them both to conclusion at the same time was nothing less than brilliant.  Stay away from the movie, in this case the book is better.
0684833395|5.0|I was never an avid reader; that is, of course, until I read Catch-22. Singularly the best book I have ever read, I might even go so far as to say that it changed my life. It has always seemed a somewhat ambivalent book to me however. It never entirely takes one side of a subject over another, which accents the absurdity of the war and of the little island of Pianosa. <BR><BR> The story itself is mainly about Yossarian, although he isn't completely the main character. He is not a coward, but he is not willing to let himself die (one of the more sensible things I've ever heard in my life!) He is a man of conviction, even if they are the &quot;wrong&quot; ones. <BR><BR> Almost everyone around him is crazy, or seems crazy to him. Everyone around him thinks HE is crazy. Yossarian must suffer through one of the worst wars this century has ever seen. He wants to find his way out, but the absurdity of catch-22 won't let him. <BR><BR> Catch-22 means that you can never win. A good example of catch-22 (which has now officially entered the English language to mean essentially the same thing) is when Yossarian says he should be grounded because he's crazy. If Yossarian wants to fly, he HAS to be crazy. However, if he wants to be grounded, he has to ask. As soon as he asks, he isn't crazy anymore, because he doesn't want to fly anymore. That sentence I just wrote might be a little hard to swallow and I recommend you read it again. <BR><BR> Anyway, catch-22 is always showing up and Yossarian doesn't mind until it wreaks havoc on a little whore-house in Rome. <BR><BR> Meanwhile the shocking surprise ending comes around with Yossarians idiot friend, Orr. Unfortunately, I JUST CAN'T give away the ending!! <BR><BR> Catch-22 has always been a thoroughly enjoyable book and I've read it five times. It never gets boring and it always exciting and funny. If you don't read this book, you are suffering a GREAT loss. I might point out a quote I once read in a library copy of Catch-22 which said pretty much the following, &quot;You will either LOVE it or HATE it.&quot; Instead of just judging it immediately, read it once and if you hate, then you hate. But you should never forgive yourself if you refuse to read this book!
0688101364|5.0|Rose Levy Beranbaum is my favorite cookbook author for a variety of reasons and this cookbook demonstrates those reasons perfectly. The recipes are easy to follow and are very concise. Beranbaum always explains the reasoning behind the ingredients, methods, and tools. The photos in this book are not only beautiful they are really very useful...and your cookies actually come out looking like the photos. I use this book to make cookies all the year round, it is a great reference.
0451160916|5.0|This was the best Stephen King book I have ever read.  I recommend this story for people who like scary novels.  Danny was a great part for the story and he was very funny with the things he did not know.  If you have not read it yet, I recommend this story very strongly
044651506X|2.0|Most thriller/mystery stories live and die by their plot lines.  If that be the test, this one mostly dies.  The author tips his hand (or perhaps wholly opens it) midway through the book.  One gains the impression that he does so in order to use the balance of the book to sell an unsaleable plot.  Without wshing to give it away, the entire plot hinges on a single unexplained (and unexplainable) assumption.  Indeed, the only &quot;mystery&quot; in the last half of the book is the reader's (logical) reluctance to accept the profferred explanation of events.         On the other hand, the author is a skillful writer, conveying a likeable protagonist and believeable dialogue.  By far the most appealing aspect of the book is its insightful description of the residents of this small section of Long Island.  The author's evocative recreation of his characters raises the product of a wholly unconvincing plot to an average book.
0399142851|5.0|After the disappointment of Hornet's Nest, it is good to have Patricia Cornwell go back to what she does best - Kay Scarpetta.  I fell in love with Kay, Lucy, Marino, and Benton Wesley right from the beginning, and I still feel that way.  I never tire of the Kay Scarpetta books!  I hope that there will be many, many more to come.  Keep them coming, Patricia!!!!
0131103628|5.0|I find this book to be excellently suited for programmers with a reasonably good experience in programming. I feel that this book would not be the one that I would recommend for beginners. A simple familiarity with basic programming concepts  I feel, would NOT be adequate for a thorough utilization of this book. On the other hand, important concepts like pointers, structures, memory addressing have been dealt with very well in this book, and from a different direction than what I have seen in other C books. I also feel that the book teaches good programming methodology in an indirect way, through numerous examples, which have been written very concisely. For example, a program for string comparison, has been written so concisely in just a few lines that it does cause wonder at how neatly a program can be written. There are numerous such other examples throughout the book. To sum up, I feel that this book would be best approached to, AFTER gaining some initial feel in programming. I also find this book to be a good place for a quick and concise reference in programming situations.
0312932081|5.0|Orson Scott Card is one of the best writers of our time.  If you liked Ender's game, I would recommend his earlier, weirder, and darker books like Songmaster, Treason, and Hart's Hope.
1563523302|4.0|This book's premise (wealth accumulation in late 20th century America is based upon an entreprenuerial occupation combined with a frugal lifestyle) is entirely sound and is certainly a message we all need to hear again.  Unfortunately, the authors, in the spirit of our age, feel compelled to burden their analysis with a good deal of somewhat superficial &quot;survey material.&quot;  One gains the impression that they believe the reader cannot be trusted to evaluate the merits of their argument by logic alone.  This is a misapprehension because, in fact, their arguments alone would carry the day. On the other hand, the book does not hide its focus -- it shouts its &quot;survey says&quot; orientation.  And, after becoming desensitized to the constant repetition of &quot;what we have found,&quot; the underlying characteristics of the &quot;prodigious accumlators of wealth&quot; provide a useful checklist for all of us.  The primary drawback of the book is its meandering, loss of focus.  One suspects that the editor told the authors &quot;we need more pages&quot; and they went back to comply.  Yet in this age of hyper-consumerism, the ultimate message of this book is much-needed and in the right hands could be life-changing.
0060976624|4.0|A fun romp through the sleazy corridors of influence peddling.  Squinting sideways at these shenanigans in Foggy Bottom, one wonders:  &quot;Is this our hallowed capitol, or a bazaar in Marrakesh?&quot; William F should be proud.
006017322X|5.0|I read this book when I was a freshman in High  School.  I enjoyed it a lot b/c it showed the discrimination down in the south in those days.  Stuff like that still happens today, but probably not as much as when it happened then.  My favorite character was probably Jem Finch, b/c he was a good character, and always looked over for Scout.  Scout, I liked a lot because she was the narrator, but told such an indepth story of what it felt like living in that prejudice town.  As for Boo Radley, he was a good character as well.  You just had to know who he was before you made any comments about him.  All in all, this was one of my favorite books because no one ever has a fair life, and in this story is it true.
0316779989|5.0|it's only with the help of writers like David Sedaris that X-mass is bearable. SantaLand Diaries is the best, but one of his new stories, Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol is also devastatingly funny. everyone in my family can expect a copy of this (and probably nothing else) under the tree.
006017322X|5.0|I first read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD when I was 15. I began it one evening and finished it just before I had to go to school the next morning...this was my first introduction to literature (&amp; late night reading), and still remains the finest example of love, drama, fear and humour.  It is the story of an event which takes place in a community divided by the implication of a white woman having consentual sex with a black man, which can only be tolerated if viewed as rape.  We see the action unfold through the eyes of a young girl Scout, daughter of the lawyer, Atticus, given the incredibly difficult and ultimately dangerous job of defending the Negro.  This is one book you should read before you die. rj
0440539811|1.0|I was suprised about all the raving reviews of the Illuminatus.  This book has no plot or structure.  Characters, places and times switch in midsentence leaving the reader puzzled and confused.  For most of the book the reader cannot even tell who or what he is reading about!  The superflous barrage of facts (and fiction) assult the reader's senses in a disorganized and chaotic manner.  All in all this book is the product of a highly ego-centerd, very arrogant, and drug induced author.

068484267X|5.0|After reading the hard cover edition I listened to the unabriged tape version and it was wonderful.  Frank McCourt is an award winning writer and an extraordinary story teller in the best of the oral tradition.  His characterizations, dialects, and songs bring the book to life.  It is one of the most fulfilling literary experiences I have ever had.
0553573403|5.0|This short-story master's epic fantasy novel is quite simply the best of class since Tolkien and one of the best novels of any genre I've read in years.  I work as a freelance book editor/doctor and can say it's more than rare to read a novel of this length, with so many subplots and characters, that so perfectly justifies its breadth.  Hollywood would do well to perk up.  This is eminently adaptable.  Highly recommended for even non-fantasy fans.<br />Ed Stackler
0380002930|5.0|I am a fiction editor, as well as an avid reader of several different genres--and I absolutely loved this novel! Mr. Adams was inspired to write this novel after creating it as a verbal story to his grandchildren. I didn't read it until I was 25-years old--and I liked it so much that I found an antiquarian first edition to add to my library. I would recommend this to everyone!   ADVISE FOR THE young REVIEWER WHO GAVE THIS BOOK A 1:  GROW UP! Just because you read lots of books, doesn't mean you are emotionally ready or able to understand them. If you hated this book so much--perhaps you are too young to grasp the real message it holds. Try reading this again in about 15 years!
0399142851|2.0|I enjoyed the first Cornwell novel I read very much (Body Farm), but they have consistantly gone down since then. I read several of the reviews complaining about the ending and realized I couldn't even remember it. Not a good thing for a suspense novel. I believe this is my last run with Ms. Cornwell
0553476580|1.0|I am totally impressed by how easily a poor writer such as Coelho is given such praise.  His worldwide aclaimed success is one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read.  The only motive I had to go to the second page is that my opinion was asked by the person who gave it to me.  I read it in the original language in which it was written, i.e., Portuguese, and I find it poorly written, both in shape and in content, if there is any at all.  Coelho repetitiveness is annoying and his pretenseis bitter and hard to swallow.  It is not uncommon that his subject matter would, at the end of a millennium lacking criticism in all areas,  find success.  I worry about the level of education our future generations will meet, if not tought now what good literature is.  The only trip I can associate with The Alchemist is its trip to my trask can.
0671570439|5.0|This book will challenge your beliefs, whether they are science bound or religious, or both.  The way Sagan combines the hard science approach of radio-astronomy with social and religious relations is brilliant.  This book is a must read for any one who enjoys challenging their beliefs
0899664474|5.0|This book was assigned in a religion class, which I dropped.  I picked it up out of pure boredom and was so surprised to find such a moving and thought provoking novel.  It is so seldom that a book comes along which can speak to your soul AND your mind.  Hesse gave the world a wonderful gift in this book.
0679457313|1.0|After reading this book, I know why it clinched the Booker Prize. Like last year's winner, Graham Swift's Last Orders, it is so literary. Nearly every paragraph contains a metaphor or a simile. It is good to have some of these sporadically placed throughout the book, but certainly not with the frequency seen in the book!. This book generated so much hype in the media but is a thorough disappointment for readers like myself. A tedious task to read.
0441003257|5.0|And for some of the reviewers, Neil Gaiman did not  write this book alone, he did not come up with all of the characters and stories. Neither did Terry Pratchett. That's why the names of both authors are on the cover. Oh, and don't send Neil Gaiman any money, he's just trying to leech off you... And Pratchett is by now bored stiff of banana daiquiris...(I'm sure he would enjoy some Scumble more...it's made from apples...well...mainly apples...)
0316920045|5.0|This was the e-mail'd recommendation I received from a friend (do I need to put those stars in there - I really didn't know).  And after reading IJ, I agree with him.  Don't read it if you never bought the line &quot;half the fun of traveling is getting there&quot; - or whatever that saying is.  I guess that's why people don't like it.  I loved the book, but I've been reading these reviews and can understand why people don't like it.  The book that is.  It's definitely not for everyone, but it's not because it's such an intellectual challenge.  Although if your vocabulary is somewhat limited or reading Michael Crichton novels taxes your brain - it might make the reading a bit more tedious (ie, boring for you, the reader).  I would suggest that if you read 100 pages and are still waiting to get into it or hoping for some epiphany by the end of the thing. Put it away ... for good.  But try it you might love it.  Finding humor in pop culture and things such as bongs raises the possiblity of enjoyment I would think.  Also you may like it if you laughed in the movie &quot;Get Shorty&quot; when Travolta corrects Farina's use of &quot;e.g.&quot; - when he meant to say &quot;i.e&quot;.  I.e, like when you submit a review to this site they ask for &quot;Your Location (ie, Moscow, Russia)&quot; sic - when they meant to put &quot;Your Location (eg, Moscow, Russia).  At the same time understanding that by noticing something like this you are a bit anal retentive, but think it is worth discussing anyway.
0151001820|4.0|When you start reading this book, it takes you a while to realize everything is actually happening in the XXe century. The prose, the characters, the enigma makes you wonder if you have not fallen on an old classic. The author has this way of joining future and past that is highly surprising and effective. <br /> This is not a mystery novel. This is a literary novel. The presence of the mystery seems there only to support a chase for a book, but it is at the same time refreshing. <br /> This book made me want to go back to my old bookshelves and get out all the Dumas I could find to read them again... with a new perspective.
0802130208|5.0|I know I'm just adding to the heap, but, as this is one of my favorite books of all time, I have to comment. Toole has mercilessly  caricatured nearly everyone and everything in his book, giving thereader an exaggerated, but palpable picture of New Orleans'neighborhoods, with neighbors in residence.<br />  Hilarious? You bet! But it is hilarity based on poignancy.  Each new episode that the pompous but pitiable Ignatius  embarks on brings its varieties of sad sacks. Yet you cannot help but laugh. And laugh. But you know, each time I  re-read it, I have to go buy some hot dogs...
006016848X|3.0|I thought that he truly did make some interesting and valid points which gave me, as a woman, fresh insights into many communications problems with men in both the personal and professional arenas.  However, I also found myself thinking that a lot of the traits and behaviors he described as masculine applied to me more than to the men I've known, and vice versa.  That in itself was okay.  I understand that his theories are obviously and understandably generalized.  It's when he starts elaborating and expounding and repeating that it begins to get a little ridiculous.  The &quot;men are like rubber bands&quot; and &quot;women are like waves&quot; metaphors really began to get on my nerves, if not a little seasick.  My goodness, how will any couple ever get their timing right so that they're there for each other when they need it?

I loved the book but can easily understand why some readers hated it.  (In my family my mother was the alcoholic.)  So I thank all those who were honest enough to say why they didn't like it. By the way, I still laugh out loud when recalling young Fanks' first confession and communion.

0451191153|5.0|<br /> This book is as fat as a dictionary, but it will challenge your views on altruism (i.e. selfishness) and show how hard it is to be openly selfishness, how hard it is to have integrity, and thrive in a parasitic society bend on having its way with your talents, your mind, and your very soul if you have one. Those concerned about the state of affairs with humanity should read this book and consider its implications that still ring true to today.  It will demonstrate that humanitarians and those with a collectivist ideology are as selfish as their counterparts. At least think when you read this book, but try harder to think for yourself, as Ayn Rand suggests. Plunge into it, sustain judgement, and view the world with a realistic perspective.  But most of all, enjoy the process and not the end.    Aaron Albelo  <br />
0899668585|5.0|Well, this book is so fascinating, I love it.  I'm fifteenyears old and I love to read/write/program computers.  I love school alot, that probally is a shock to most,but, it's true.  I have loved to read for a long time, as well as use computers to the outer limit.  My class is on chapter 9 and I finished it this morning.  I would say it kinda is sad.  As much as I love it, I'm not satisfied with the ending.  Don't get me wrong, it's just I want more, more, and more.  I want to know what happens to Dill, Scout, Atticus,Tom Robisnon's Family, and Jem as well, at the end Boo Radley saves Scout and Jem, This is Just a marvelous novel.  It's sad, exciting, love, and many other things in it.  It's a must read.
0399142533|5.0|In New Zealand, this book was sold as &quot;Better than Grisham, or your money back&quot;! I enjoyed the book so much that I wrote to the NZ publisher telling them to &quot;keep my money&quot;! They were good enough to write back and say a new &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; thriller will be out early in '98 - can't wait!
0060924160|1.0|Forced by my girlfriend to go though this agonizing text, I was struck with the beastly style, overweening self-congradulations (golly, aren't I clever for coming up with these insights in to human relations!) and general bad writing.  Egads! What madness is this? The point, if I gather correctly, is that men and women communicate differently. Only the truly credulous fools who bought into the whole &quot;gender-neutral&quot; revolution are surprised -- the rest of us just look  puzzled and say: &quot;Well, DUH!&quot;  <br />  It is instructive to also note a dirty little secret: John Gray, PhD, the relationship expert/guru is a divorced man ... whose ex-wife, Barbara DeAngelis, PhD, is yet ANOTHER &quot;relationship expert/guru&quot;. Dear reader, would you take legal advice from a convicted felon? Psychological advice from a schitzophenic?
0131103628|5.0|This book is not &quot;for Dummies&quot;.  It assumes that you already have some knowledge of structured programming languages (i.e. Pascal).  For example, this book spends four well-written pages explaining everything you need to know about functions.  If you don't know what a function is, this will clearly not be enough.  However, if you do know about functions, this book will not drone on and on for an entire chapter or two on the subject like some of the foot-crunching tomes the size of an encyclopdia. <br /> The book is expensive ($40) for its size (approx. 250pgs.), but it is worth every penny.  To quote the authors: &quot;C is not a big language, and it is not served well by a big book.&quot; <br /> As a bonus, almost anything you need to know about C can be found in seconds using the excellent index.  It should be noted that this is a language reference and will NOT tell you how to use your editing environment or compiler. <br /> In summary, intermediate or advanced programmers should be able to learn C with reasonable proficiency in a short amount of time.
006017322X|5.0|I have a personal policy to re-read To Kill A Mockingbird every three years.  It helps me remember how to exist in the modern world as a moral person.  This reaffirmation of justice, honesty, integrity and compassion in the daily lives of common American people involved with uncommon events may be why To Kill A Mockingbird won the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  Harper Lee has an intelligence about people -- or at least about the best of us as we'd like to remember ourselves.  Is our daily America as decent as this book recalls?  Probably not.  So, it isn't accurate literature exactly. But it IS an exceptional moral story: how David slew Goliath, how Atticus and Scout beat a thinly-disguised KKK by insisting on the integrity of the accused and accuser alike.  It works because it's seen through the eyes of an adult woman remembering everything as a precocious 6-year-old tomboy.  Atticus Finch represents a sure and convincing morality, almost larger than life.  He's able to shoot a rabid dog straight through the forehead in order to save the street from it, just in time.  He's almost mythic. But mythology works sometimes, especially when transported to a dusty Alabama town to explicate terrible mundane events which are, all things considered, equally mythic in force.  Racism IS a dragon. The Klan IS a monster.  They're just mundane, so we don't recognize them as such. An innocent African-American is accused of an unspeakable crime because the &quot;victim,&quot; and then the town, needs it.  Finch systematically dismantles the accusations based on simple evidence which no one in his right mind could disbelieve.    The story becomes a matter of basic decency and justice because Scout, the girl, has the ingenuousness and moral bewilderment of a smart 6-year-old who sees no racial lines, and who thus is able to express the fundaments which adults either ignore or have become blinded to.  Mythologizing her father allows us to understand that, in some things, the fundaments are valid.  In some things justice is, in fact, this simple--an deliberate act of integrity and will.  A side note:  Truman Capote was the model for Dill.
006017322X|5.0|I have always held within myself a belief that every person no matter how insignificant,  or mediocre manages to touch brilliance and greatness for brief moments in his or her lifetime. Such experiences would ofcourse be congruous to that person's capabilities but creativity during such time be it expressed in a book, a painting or even a poem, soars heights of genius which are beyond ordinary human limitations. In my opinion, Harper Lee's  novel \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\" is a product of such divine creativity. It's very genius in style, setting and plot make it an isolated achievement on the part of the Author who has not been able match this with any of her other  works . The kaleidoscope of characters offered by the novel, set in a remote southern town of Maycomb County, holds the reader spellbound, while he marvels at the style with which the author prevents the sombre theme from clouding the general mood of the story. The lighthearted adventures of Jem and Scout have left such vivid impressions on my mind that I almost get the feeling of having been in Maycomb as the novel progresses. I have long since ceased to just  `read' this book. For me, the book has become a lifelong companion. I will always cherish the mixed emotions of pain, triumph, fear and love that it inspires in me.
0553103547|5.0|&quot;A Game Of Thrones&quot; is one of the few books that I wish with me shipwrecked on a desert island.  A book that exists to entertain! Sparse, clean, memorable prose despite 800+ pages.  A twisting, turning, churning plot that endlessly surprised me.  Strong characters who really speak to my inner world.  Fantasy is written for escapists, and comparisons between Anya and Sansa, or Jon and Joffrey, offer events that will send misfits like me into radical swings of emotion! Some of the most affecting scenes are the small ones.  Never pedantic like Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot;, but less intelligent.  A far stronger sense of place and character  than in Williams' &quot;Memory,Sorrow,and Thorn&quot;.  All the female characters, when they enter the dream world, instantly focus on plunging necklines and demure vs risque attire, since it is  a genetic feature of women to dwell on their appearance --- oops, that was Robert Jordan's &quot;The Wheel Of Time&quot;, not this one.  Far better characters, especially the women, than in Jordan's misguided and culturally shallow epic.  My greatest fear is that George RR Martin will not be able to sustain this invented world.  Jordan's &quot;The Eye Of The World&quot; showed real promise, but it has collapsed.  Will the same happen to Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice And Fire&quot;?  The sneak peek &quot;Theon&quot; appearing at the end of the paperback was a minor pleasure that tells me nothing of the second book's potential for greatness or for crashing failure. The settings are often amazing: The journey to the castle where there are sloping dungeon floors was stunning to this reader (to be more specific would mean giving a pleasure away to new readers).  Surprisingly adult scenes stake out a claim in territory unusual for the mostly juvenile genre.  Did you too get the feeling that &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; was all white and all right?  Martin's world is irrevocably multicultural, though most action occurs in societies that appear European. It contains strong femininist material set in telling counterpoint to a sexist fantasy world.  It mostly avoids cultural controversies of the modern day, with allusion to anti-abortion leaning and two small disturbing homophobic inferences (in the author's voice) in a book otherwise absent of author-intrusive positive or negative slant.  I wonder if such &quot;sneaky Puritanisms&quot; as these will date this book, much as &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; is dated, and as Jordan's sexism has already rendered his epic obsolete and howlingly unintentionally funny.  Otherwise, Martin has been able to cast a spell on this reader.  Read this book.  It is full of major and minor pleasures, full to bursting!  Grand entertainment.

0679457313|5.0|The God of Small Things is one of those extraordinary novels, written in a flash of divine brilliance portraying ordinary, everyday people like you and me. Deeply personal in nature, it exposes the ever so realistic emotions that each of us experience in our journey through life, as seen and described through the innocent eyes of a pair of (di-zygotic) twins. The detail in which Roy describes the South-Indian landscape of Ayemennem and the innocuous manner in which she gives an insight into the mentality of people like Mammachi, Chacko, Baby Kochamma and all the other characters, is startlingly realistic. Quite becomingly, it is the small things in the novel that leave deep impressions if not scars on the reader's mind. Whether it is Pappachi's moth, the OrangeDrink-LemonDrink man, or Sophie Mol the thimble-drinker and coffin-cartwheeler, they all come back to haunt the subconscious in the strangest of ways. I thought I knew what life was about before I read this novel.

This tale of the heroic Stark family fighting to protect the world they know and love will take you on a wild ride.

There is never a dull moment, and the readers will be left waiting for the next book!
0446310786|5.0|A totally innocent view from a child who is growing up. The ideas presented are therefore mostly 'hidden', and so noticing their presence is a task in itself. I had to read it about three or four times (how many I cannot exactly remember) before realising that I had been absorbing so much (how much is for me to know and you to read and find out).  <br /> Like many other reviewers of this book, I first read it in school, so I thought, if the education people placed it on reading lists it must be a good book, either in content or presentation. This one, as I found, was good at both. If one ignores what I wrote above about a difficult read, he/she would understand why Scout is the protagonist. Lee's use of her (Scout's) innocence (and that of Jem and Dill) was highly appropriate, they were yet to be affected by the ugly side of life (or as I like to put it, still existing in the realm of 'It's a small world after all'). As they grow up and undergo certain experiences (if I told which I would spoil your read) they start to realise the prejudice and discrimination that exists in this world. There is more on hypocrism, education, and human nature but I don't think it is appropriate to turn this review into a novel, so I shall stop here.  <br /> Some general knowledge of certain things may help in the enjoyment of this book. It would also be interesting to do some research into some names and motifs in the book (like I had to for school) as this would reveal some interesting reasons why Lee chose them. Knowing these reasons would add to one's comprehension of this book.<BR> Definitely worth re-reading and re-re-reading.

0452270073|5.0|As a stand-alone novel it's good. As book one in a trilogy, it's excellent. You meet the main characters in Regeneration. You learn their secrets in The Eye in the Door. You share their pain in The Ghost Road. It's a very different--and often haunting--look at World War I through its soldiers and their horrors. But it's Barker's writing that makes this trio a &quot;10.&quot; There is history, fiction, philosophy, psychiatry, even sex and gore; but all part of the story, none of it gratuitous. She does not clutter her prose with tedious descriptions, yet every picture is crystal clear. She tells you things you don't want to know, through three books you won't want to put down.

6303913881|4.0|This film, like many that come from the Verhoeven/Esterhas camp, teems with gratuitous sex, contrived dialogue, abominable direction and substandard acting.  The sad part about all this is that I really like this film.  Why?  Not since &quot;Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill&quot; has such a female-driven tour de force in camp cinema emerged.     Elizabeth Berkley gives her forerunner Tura Satana extreme competition at all levels.  She overacts; she dresses like a tramp.  Most importantly, however, she uses sex and sexuality to get what she seeks.  Furthermore, the supporting cast in &quot;Showgirls,&quot; led by the wonderful Gina Gershon (who really IS a respectable actor), adds even more corn to the &quot;camp&quot; fire.   Set against the glitz of Las Vegas, &quot;Showgirls&quot; is excess and decadence perfected.  Sure, it is technically a horrible movie, and we will not benefit from it culturally.  Nevertheless, in this day and age of stress and anxiety I believe that we all need some senseless brain fodder, so chow down on &quot;Showgirls.&quot;   END

The content is universal crossing time and cultures.The writing is eloquent. Not a word is wasted. This book is a must for students of history, sociology, psychology and any fool who thinks war is cool.
3822884979|4.0|At last, the history of an art form seen by millions around the world during this century, but little documented.  The biographies are concise and the illustrations give a good representation of each artists' work.  The German printing is outstanding with excellent clarity and colour rendition.  In order to make this a better guide and reference work,  I would suggest these improvements for the next edition.  First, a title or caption,  and date, for each picture. This places a work in context with others and would illustrate the fun associated with pinup art. Secondly, the biographies should be in one alphabetical order.  An artist, and examples of his or her work, would be easier to find.  Additional books, magazine articles and collections, such as that of Alberto Vargas at the University of Kansas, need to be mentioned.  Lastly, inclusion of relevant Internet sites and publishers would provide additional sources of information for collectors, art students and others.     Although not perfect from an informational standpoint, this book is a real attraction to the eye and senses and well worth the purchase price.
0812550706|5.0|I first read the book in 1987. It was lent to me by a friend with his recommendations. It was so good that I remembered it till this day. While browsing at Amazon.com, I ran a search for it and end up buying it. I got it 3 months after ordering it! Well it was well worth the wait. I do notice that it was changed a bit especially at the end (mine was the author's definitive edition), but it made the book very much better. I didn't like the ending in the earlier edition. But Card still missed the mistake at page 177, it was &quot;Rose the Nose's mistake&quot; not &quot;Bonzo's mistake&quot; (please refer to page 105). I had just bought the entire Ender's series just now at Amazon.com. I hope I didn't make a mistake ;-) by doing that!!!
0553277472|5.0|Every twenty-something knows a thrity-something who claims this book changed their lives.  They may very well be telling the truth, but I know far more people that put this book down in frustration than in rapture.  Pirsig indeed captures a subtle, yet vital, way to engage reality in a mechanized and secular late 20th century.  This book certainly must be credited for inspiring so much of the New Age literary spiritualism that followed it.  But this book is not for everyone.  Heavy doses of Kant and sweeping passages of rural landscapes have caused many a person to put it down thinking they've grasped the general idea, which is enough to discuss it at the next social gathering.  This book, however, is a journey of the mind and the self at a particular moment in time. It is also a touching, and sometimes wrenching, acount of a man's own life.   Pirsig's view of integrating technology into one's spiritual perspective is actually more interesting now than when he wrote it.  It offers an immense amount to a prepared reader.  But don't expect it to be an easy book offering any answers.  It is a beautiful, though trying, process.  If it doesn't grab you right away, don't be afraid to put it down for a few months.  When the time is right, this book can be a centering experience.
0380973634|5.0|I have been a &quot;Sandman&quot; fan since it was first published in Brazil , and since then I've became a Neil Gaiman fan , also . And , when it became known that that beautiful series was going to end (and even if I said at the time &quot;Well,nothing as good as &quot;Sandman&quot;could end forever!&quot;),it made me a little sad , and aprehensive . But if &quot;Neverwhere&quot; - and that is the first Neil Gaiman novel I ever read - is a sign of the kind of things we could expect from him now on , well , the end of Sandman  doesn't matter , at all .<br /> The book is a wonderful mixture of myth , legends , fairy tales , and Clive Barker (and Monty Python !) for good measure . It's also a little bit like something from Douglas Adams (The hero , Richard , is an Arthur Dent look-alike , almost ), but there's a huge difference between mr. Gaiman's book and any Hitchhiker books (or Clive Barker's,for that matter ) : his sense of narrative structure is amazing , and the story flows like a dark and beautiful river .<br /> Also , I hadn't watched the series yet , and I am a little suspicious if one could actually produce all the wonderful sights and sounds and scenes from the novel (that is , as far as I know ,strictly  based upon the series screenplay ).But mr. Gaiman has surprised me a lot of times already .
0345403959|5.0|It seem to me that &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; is the most mature work from David &amp; Leigh Eddings. Some of the long-standing humor and plot techniques they have developed over the years are missing from this work, and in their place, one finds depth in the storytelling.

006100166X|5.0|For those readers who are unfamiliar with the novels of Georgette Heyer, this book is a wonderful introduction to her genre of romance.  Incorporating a bit of social history (although I wouldn't recommend believing everything in this book as literal fact) and a plotline of innocent love, this book captures the readers heart and leaves them with a feeling of intense satisfaction.  The simpleness of the story and the purity of the characters is much appreciated in an age of trashy romance novels.  Also, Heyer uses a wonderful sense of humor in her character development.  Overall, the novel is delightful.

0684800713|4.0|Ernest Hemingway has been called one of the greatest American writers of his time.  He has also been called an expatriate, an alcoholic, a traitor and Papa.  He was a man who never forgave his father for committing suicide, yet took his own life in 1961.   <br /> Although being hailed as a great American writer, he spent much of his life living outside the US.  The two seemingly contradictory epigraphs in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises were put together on the page by a seemingly contradictory man.   <br /> Whether he did it intentionally or not, Hemingway wrote The Sun Also Rises in a way that keeps scholars and students in constant speculation as to his theme.  His reference to his friend and mentor, Gertrude Stein's comment on the status of the post World War I society  would make it seem that he is in agreement of her bleak and cynical outlook.   <br /> The lost generation, like the ancient Epicureans were in the constant pursuit of moderate pleasure.  They lived for the day and gave little though to the consequences of their actions, or to the low that usually follows a high.  However, he does not settle for one epigraph.   <br /> In reaching back to quote Ecclesiastes, a second century preacher and philosopher, Hemingway reveals that no matter how gray the world seems, there is a light to guide us.  That light is hope. In his seemingly shallow characters intended to epitomize the lost generation, Hemingway shows - albeit briefly - the even they have traces of compassion and humanity left.   <br /> The narrator, Jake, is a complex character.  Having sustained an injury in the war, Jake is incapable of intimate physical relations with women.  Jake is an authentic person.  He has friends who, although some are shallow and egocentric, care for him and value his friendship.  The fact that he is impotent, however, throws a shadow on his character.   <br /> Although he is seen as one of the more genuine characters, it is conceivable that he would not be so virtuous without his affliction.  Although Jake shows his dark and sardonic side on occasion, he is a testament that there are still people who care in the world.   <br /> The fact that Hemingway made Jake incapable of siring children, is the author's way of not tipping the scale too far in the direction of hope. <br /> Pedro is another character who shows the hope of the novel.  Pedro's naïveté is a refreshing change to the world weary characters representing the lost generation.  All Pedro knows is bullfighting.  It is his world, his life and he is good at it.   Pedro, too, is not a perfect character.  He is seduced by Brett, and as a result , falls in what he thinks to be love with her.  He allows Cohn to provoke him into fighting.  Pedro took his beating and did not let Cohn take his pride.  Pedro is flawed like all men, but he shows with his youthful energy and vision, that there are good people.  It is no coincidence that Pedro is a bullfighter.  He stood tall in his suit of lights, a glamorous spectacle for all to see.  Even in his moments of shame, Pedro managed to hang on to his dignity.   <br /> Although Bill seems to be the logical character to turn to next, it is in Brett that Hemingway gives the most subtle yet poignant glimmer of hope.  Throughout the novel, Brett is seen as an opportunistic, cynical and uncaring woman.   <br /> Completely undeserving of her title-by-marriage.  She shamelessly has an affair with Cohn, then tosses him aside to return to Michael.  She continues her escapades by seducing Pedro, the innocent young bullfighter.  Yet there is something within her that draws Jake in as her would-if-only-could-be lover and maintains him as a trusted friend and confidant.  That alone is not enough to argue for her role as a character of hope.  It is her affair with Pedro that shows her potential.  During the course of their affair, Pedro believes that he is in love with Brett.  Brett realized that she is not in love with Pedro, but with what he represents: youth, strength, courage and prestige.   <br /> Brett's realization that she would hurt Pedro, perhaps irrevocably, and that she must leave him and all he represents, is what makes her a character on the edge.  She is by all rights caught up in the mentality of the lost generation, and even after her epiphany, will be so caught up again, but her enlightenment was there.  She had made the realization and crossed the line from pleasure seeker to enlightened soul.  For one brief shining moment, she thought of the well being of another and not merely of her own.  Brett saw the light and became a symbol of hope.   <br /> Hemingway's novel paints a somewhat bleak picture of things to come in the post World War I years.  His characters spend their time drinking and running from affair to affair.  A shallow existence to be sure.  Yet when in the country, there is less time wasted on pointless dialogue and more time spent on the description and appreciation of the beauty of the wilderness.  His vivid description of the panorama is a salute to hope.  The fact that even his most shallow character, Brett, can have an epiphany bringing her to making the only unselfish choice in her life is a true tribute to his idea of hope.
0345389409|1.0|Memnoch the Devil was a complete disaster.  I was not only dissappointed by the false image the vampires in the book protrayed, but the very  annoying wordiness that literally drove my mind into a frenzy.  She spoke in to many riddles, and there was basically no plot.  The only action happening in this book was when Lestat tried to emerge from hell.      I started reading the beginning, and I was like, it's getting good so far....,but boy was I wrong.  First, Lestat's talking to David about something or someone that's following him, next he's talking to the spirit of Roger, a mortal man whom he killed, and then we get to hear the wonderful life of Roger as a young man until his death.  Lestat is asked to take care of Dora, (at the request of Roger) a young, crass theologist, who believes she can change the world with her beliefs, yeah...sure.  Then here comes the lovely Memnoch, who asks Lestat if he can help him in a perpetual battle with God that's been going on before Lestat's time, enough already!!       She could have spared us with that nonsense about the Creation of the World, and how Memnoch was a human for a short period of time, while teaching a small civilization the basic tools for survival.  This book simply gave an opinion on how things of the world came about, and no plot I add again. If there was a plot can someone please tell me what it is?!      The characters, such a pity, because they had no sense of feeling or emotion, more like mere puppets with no life.  Lestat didn't seem like himself.  He should be on writing about a tantalizing mortal woman he has his eyes on, or an exciting journey that takes place somewhere across the world, with him in it.  Instead he's talking about his ravings of the devil to Armand, and David.        This book would have got a rating of 2, had she not killed Armand.  He was my favorite character of them all.  I couldn't get over his innocent yet, decieving looks.  I loved the marvelous appearance, Anne created for him, and his eyes, with one look, it would be untempting to look away.  I missed Armand so much, that it hurts me to know why she persistently tortured him through the whole Vampire Chronicles.  The poor fellow, had a rough mortal life, next he's with Marius, who keeps going away on little escapades, and then he's a vampire around the age of 17, I belive.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Of course Marius is his maker, and Armand who thinks he will finally be with him, thought wrong.  He's not enjoying one bit of immortality, and now he has the burden of a coven, on his hands, but that's a long story.  Later, in the series he doesn't seem much better off than before, and more depressed with every night that comes.  I'm off subject, but I had to state that what Armand went through was pure pain, and the whole time I believed he just wanted to have someone to seek comfort and love, with it returned as well.  He most certainly deserved it but instead, he gets to kill himself, which I'm sure it's something that required very  little thinking skills on Anne's part.      Please read the book.  I'm giving this review , that is putting the novel down in disgrace, and you're wondering why, I'm requesting that you read it, right?  Well, for those who are wondering, it's  because it is the only way you can really get the idea of the hell I had to be put through.  It's the only way you can really give a true opinion.  For those who thought it was a blast, that is fine, you're entitled to you're opinion.  Read the book and give your thoughts and feelings.

006091307X|4.0|Profoundly disturbing, if only for its impenetrability. This strikes me as acid jazz for the literary set--angelically resonant prose that surrounds some &quot;deeper meaning&quot; like a cage. The reader can see, but never grasp, the glittering, captured daemon of meaning beneath. I'd recommend this only to readers willing to wade through much maddening obscurity to claim a higher ground.
1563523302|3.0|After the hype on television's 20/20 and all of the trouble I went throught to get the book, I was a little disappointed in the final product.  While it did have some good info, it was essentially a re-affrimation of things that I have heard and read before.  Besides the basic affirmation there were some common sense pointers like investing in the field of your expertise that sort of stuck out for me.  The continuous use of tables was a bit tedious.  After all, do we really need to know the price per pound of different domestic and foreign automobiles?  The authors preface this book saying that they spent 10 years researching this subject.  After 10 years I would like a little more meat.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for a definitive step by step road map to becoming a millionaire, but a little less chart junk and more solid information would have been nice.
0671646788|5.0|Just the first 2 chapters of this book are worth it's tiny price several thousand times over. If you don't know what &quot;The Failure Disease&quot; is, read chapter 2.

My favorite part is where Einstein is spelling with the dominoes and says that if he leaves his people he will die.  The woman takes this literally and begs him to stay.  He tells her if he leaves he will &quot;Die of Lonely&quot;.  I needed a mop to wipe up after that scene.  Loved this book!!!!
0606029818|5.0|Thinking of buying &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot;? Don't.  Edgar Allan Poe still ranks as one of America's premiere literary figures.  Unfortunately, many of the books you will find on your local bookshelf contain less than Poe's complete works.  Or worse, revised and abridged versions of his writings.<br /> In &quot;The Complete Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; you will be treated to Poe's creative genius in full measure.  You can go beyond the Murders in the Rue Morgue and delve into the Mystery of Marie Roget.  The Black Cat is here along with The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.  Everything you expect from Edgar Allan Poe is here; the horror, the suspense, the macabre....  But beyond this lies Poe's humor, deductive logic, and desciptive prose.  You owe it to yourself to buy this book.  If you have not taken the time to read everything Poe has to offer, do so now.  It will be one of the best reading experiences you will ever have.
0312932081|5.0|I have only read this book once because I don't think I can stand to read it again.  It is a brilliant book about a brilliant child who understands *how* to perform a frightening and monumental task, but does not understand *why* he should or should not participate.  Some previous reviewers have said Ender is too grown up; I think they may not have been paying attention to the distinction between having an astounding intellect and having the wisdom that we all hope to attain as adults.  Ender has the intellect to spare, but as another reviewer points out, he does not have the historical or social context to make judgments with all his knowledge.  He is used by adults who can't do but can teach, and in the long run becomes a hero against his will.  He bears the  weight of a responsibility that shouldn't be on the shoulders of an elected world leader who chose to be there, and literally has no peers with whom to be a child.  Every peer he had, he defeated, and in the end, he has nothing to call his own.  I found this book to be one of the most crushing and gripping books I have ever read.  I keep thinking I will read it again, but I don't know if I can--it was that hard to bear the ending.
0385424736|5.0|This has to be the best Grisham novel yet!  I was so drawn to the main character, Rudy.  He is just the type of guy you have to cheer for.  My only hope is that the movie does him and Mr. Grisham justice.  I would hate to see another disastorous interpretation of Grisham (less we forget The Firm or even worse The Chamber).
1563523302|5.0|The difference between this book and many others on similar topics is a strong empirical base of evidence to support the author's opinions. The book is entertaining, to be sure, but it is primarily a research report, and that is its strength.

0312932081|4.0|I've read just about every science fiction and &quot;fantasy&quot; book I've been able to lay my hands on and this is one of my favourites (not quite up there with Neuromancer and Tigana, but pretty close).  It is one of those books you can read again and enjoy.  The caracters have depth and are believable, no all-good or all-evil caracters, even &quot;sickly sweet little Valentine&quot;, as one reviewer has it, has her share of conflict and displays a darker side.  This is not a &quot;one little kid saves the universe&quot; type of book in the good old pulp tradition.  It's about being different, the pressure adults put on children to perform, making difficult decisions, and about empathy.  And just in case that sounds boring, there's plenty of action for the lover of fast moving adventures.

0553267787|5.0|After spending a completely arid season in Texas, culminating in Lubbock, of all places, I fled in 1979 back to England to find most of the country shut down by strikes, and the all too rare piece of BBC dramatic brilliance, Tinker Taylor.. on the box.  Inspired by the television I at once read the book, whose spirit of defeat, betrayal and melancholia so closely matched my own.  This is a tragedy of manners, about a genteel British caste who have become demode, and outgunned by the Americans they look down on.  This is an England of Oxford and Cambridge and public schools, where the villain betrays his lover to the communists and George Smiley has to uncover the truth and the betrayals of his private life as well as his public career.  It is an out and out gem.  All else by the author have been potboilers.  Even here, some of his characters are a little hard to take.  The intrigue, though, is brilliant, yet  whether it has its origins in the authors experiences with the British Security Services or as a teacher in the cliquish atmosphere of Eton is hard to assess.  The most amusing thing about the whole TV series was the number of hacks who claimed they could not folow the plot.  In Britain, we used to have intellectuals, but now we just have the worse press in the world, Tony Blair, and Princess somebody or other.  To get a true taste of this gloom, read Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy, but then leave LeCarre alone. And England, too, if you have any sense.
0716703440|5.0|I think this is the best book in Gravitation made ever. It's clear, with a lot of clarifying pictures and a lot of references.

0385486804|5.0|I listened to the unabridged book on tape (Books-on-Tape, Inc).  The book was riveting and it was often difficult to get out of the car and away from the tape player.  I often took short unnecessary trips just so I could hear the next few minutes of the book.  I had first seen John Krakauer on MSNBC with Tom Brokaw last winter.  My interest was triggered then by his interview.  I know a physician who successfully &quot;summitted&quot; Everest after two previous failed attempts.  He had told me some of what the experience was like, but the book made it seem even more terrifying, dangerous, and foolhardy for novice climbers who happen to be able to afford to take such a trip.  After reading the book I know that climbing Mt. Everest isn't something I would want to do on a whim.  I can't imagine walking across two aluminum ladders tied together with rope traversing a cravass while wearing crampons.
0684874350|3.0|&quot;Have you read that book by Frank McCourt?  It's sooo  good, you positively haaaaaave to read it!&quot;  This statement would then be followed by close to ten minutes of ravings about Irish accents, something about a pig's head, overflowing latrines and dirty Limericks.  <br />  A few weeks ago, I finally got tired of being continually gushed at when I would reply that I haven't read Angela's Ashes.  I bought a copy, went home and prepared to have the most profound experience of my life.  I was somewhat disappointed. <br /> The first several chapters of the book were interesting and I found myself laughing out loud several times.  The childlike narration is good in the beginning, but you would expect it to mature somewhat throughout the book as the child/narrator grows up.  It doesn't. The latter parts of the book are what gave me trouble, I suppose.  The gruesome details of every sort of sickness imaginable and the description of horrible living conditions is pretty compelling stuff, but after awhile it just gets gross.  Not to even mention that there are some very personal things about Mr. McCourt that I would have rather not known. <br /> It would be unfair of me to say that I didn't like the book at all, because I felt it had it's moments. But to me those few moments don't make up for the number of times I have been accosted with &quot;Oooh have you  read that book by Frank McCourt?&quot;
0684874350|5.0|I spend my sparse reading moments on non-fiction. This book is the best I've read.  It has taken me to an Ireland I only thought I knew.  I giggled and cried in my armchair....  We have felt your humanity, Mr. McCourt.  Thank you for surviving to share it with us.
0316921173|5.0|Having first been put off this book because of all the hype, I finally read it when it was given to me as a gift.  Never let the hype put you off (or on)to a book.  And don't be afraid of its length.  &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is either the best book I've ever read, or one that needs a good deal of editing.  It is difficult to say, because David Foster Wallace practically invents a new style of literary composition, and, in its unfamiliarity to me it is difficult to determine whether it is truly audacious or fantastic.  But I give it the benefit of the doubt, and was so moved by its story and delivery (cerebrally if not viscerally) that I did nothing else but read it for a few weeks, eschewing all other forms of entertainment.  And there is irony in this, as part of the plot involves a form of entertainment that is so involving that its viewers refuse to do anything -- eat, sleep, use the bathroom -- but watch the entertainment.  David Foster Wallace, whose work I first encountered in Harpers magazine, may not be a genious (although the MacArthur Foundation certainly thinks he is), but his command of language and a multi-tentacled story is firm.  The story simply flows from beginning to end, and the footnotes, though off-putting at first, become as interesting as the body of the text.  My theory for his use of footnotes, and the length of the book itself, is that Wallace wants you to understand that you are reading a book, and doing just that.  It's interactivity is that only a book can provide, and thus the sheer weight of the book combined with the fact that the reader must constantly wrestle back and forth with the endnotes makes perfectly clear you are READING A BOOK -- not reading a novelization, not reading a text that can be anything but what it is -- a book.  In addition to the format, the story itself is so involving that the reader must frequently return a few pages back in order to double check the timeline, revisit a character, etc.  And its very theme -- circularity (or annular) -- becomes evident when you come to the end of the story and then reread the first chapter to gain closure.  In short, the book is an academic and literary challenge, one that forces full involvement of the reader, and one that revises the fact that books are a unique form of communication, at once intensely private and a dialogue with another person.  Read it.
0891902236|5.0|When I first saw this book, I never knew that reading it could be such a powerful experience. Anne Frank touched my life. She opened a new door for me, teaching me about a world that was so far, yet so close to us today. She educated her readers, she taught us about a time that would never be forgotten. Who ever reads this book, I know will be mesmerized and will learn more about their own lives at the same time. Anne Frank did indeed fullfill her mission. She touched so many lives, and a thing like that does not come often.Thank you.Anne Frank will never be forgotten.The Holocaust will never be forgotten.
0679442790|4.0|For the three hours it takes to read this short book, the outside world disappears.  When it reappears at the book's conclusion, the reader's view of the behavior of some &quot;ordinary&quot; Germans during and after World War II is changed.  Schlink sweeps up the reader and totally immerses him/her in dramatic tension, quick narrative pace, and thought-provoking views of the German past by creating a unique love story involving singular characters and spanning  several decades. The book would have had a longer lasting effect for me, however, if an important &quot;secret,&quot; one which, in fact, impels Hanna's actions, had not been obvious to me from the start.  Her behavior as the book progresses simply confirmed my early suspicions, preventing the suspense from developing fully.  By the time the author formally reveals Hanna's secret, almost 2/3 of the book has passed.  Additionally, I am not sure that protecting this secret is sufficient motivation to rationalize the full extent of Hanna's self-destruction. Michael's philosophical questioning, which adds immeasurably both to the thematic scope  and pleasure of this book, does not fully explain his motivations, his actions, or his inactions, at least on the human level. Nevertheless, this is a totally absorbing, memorable novel with unusual characters in unusual conflicts, one which will reverberate long after you close its covers.
044651506X|2.0|After tasting death on a Manhattan street, John Corey, a New York detective, sees the world through an icy film of sarcasm and remoteness as he recovers in a  Long Island shore community.   Asked to help investigate the murder of a neighbor couple, he moves expertly but woodenly through the technicalities, disregarding law and convention, doggedly following clues that suggest scientific terrorism and a government coverup.  When that trail grows cold, Corey seeks other answers, but more deaths ensue and his fog of detachment begins to dissolve.  An explosive catharsis marks the end of his search for the criminal and a gradual return to the reality of his own feeling and involvement.<br />  Into this framework, veteran author DeMille has hastily crammed an undifferentiated mass of irrelevant detail, false leads, bad jokes, stock characters, class distinctions, and abrasive discourtesies both verbal and physical.  The reader is left to slog through this sand dune of print in search of logical plot lines.  Seldom has the value of thoughtful editing and revision been so evident through its absence.  Loyal DeMille readers expected better; newcomers might not wish to return.
0345389409|4.0|Anne has saved her best writing for last in this book.  If you can get past the first half of the book, your mind will be realling with the implications that present day religion is still a distortion of the true meaning of Jesus's life and teachings.    You are taken on a tour of Heaven, Jesus's last few years on earth, and Memnoch's school in Hell that is so vividly displayed by Anne's great writing she is on the verge of being called a heretic, or even a devil worshipper!   But once you finish the book you are left thinking about our place on this earth, and that love and respect of your fellow human beings, love of the beauty of earth and creation, and forgiveness of all those who have wronged you may be all that is needed to receive passage into Heaven.  This book is a must read for those who are doubting their religion.

0151001820|4.0|A decent airplane book.  The protagonist is looking for a missing book for which its printer was burned to death at the stake during the inquisition. He learns gradually that the book he is seeking has the last bit of information needed to summmon the devil.  He looks back in history to the Inquisition and into the pages of Alexander Dumas' derring do Three Musketeers serials in tracing and authenticating the copies available to him.  Then he begins to notice that his search is beginning to look like a series of events and characters from Dumas' writings.     The beginning of this mystery is not at all promising.  Bedeviled with sensibilities that are distasteful to many, including a scene in which the protagonist decides that a woman is interested in sex because she has large breasts, or, smokes in the presence of antiquarian books, the novel keeps the pages churning because the plot line is compelling.        Aside from data dumps, such as  a pages long list of antiquarian books, there is fascinating information about the methods of acquiring and authenticating the books.  The passions of collectors weave into the plot, as do the dark presence of the devil him/herself. In addition, the European feel for connection to centuries old history is skillfully woven into the scene setting, as when, in passing, a present day Paris apartment that has a view to the Seine is noted by the author to also have had a view of the public burnings during the Inquisition.     Nevertheless, the mystery itself is enriched by a plot within a plot device, providing both an interesting puzzle and a dramatic ending. Aside from a more sensitive touch in sex scenes, one can ask little more of this genre.
0899668380|5.0|This book is so well written you can't stop reading to eat.  From the first page you are absorbed into the story and become Robert Neville.  You feel the sheer hell it would be to live in solitude, to be the only man left on the planet and be tortured nightly by vampires who want you dead.  Matheson's words flow so smooth from the page you shudder at the horror in the world he's created.  A magnificent story that becomes so real you want to lock your doors and windows before the sun goes down.  This book is a must read.  (For those who may be interested; Hollywood is remaking &quot;Omega Man&quot;, a well done adaption of Matheson's novel.  Unfortunately, this remake, so far titled &quot;I am Legend&quot;, will not do justice to the novel.  The film will star Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ridly Scott will direct.  Expect this movie to be a worthless piece of garbage filled with explosions and stupid one liners from Schwarzenegger.  And don't even think the movie will end like the book. I read the screenplay.)
0671004107|5.0|I found this to be one of those books that inspires you in your own work!
0684874350|5.0|I avoided and dreaded reading this book, because my own life growing up in Ireland in the '40's and '50's were only five notches above this situation. Imagine a country rampant with tuberculosis, few job opportunities, no birth control, no social service agencies, no therapists to help parents cope with the depression over the death of a child, no understanding of alcoholism, no children of alcoholics support groups, no health care to speak of, no health department, little or no food, no clothes, no heat, no Needies Fun or Toy Drive at Christmas, and a skewed education system.  Imagine having a separate school, the Leamy's School for poor children, the Christian Brothers for better off children, and the Jesuits for the well-to-do?  After finishing the book, and loving every chapter, I was not depressed at all. It is a great book; a memorable story of trials, tribulations and triumph for some members of a family forced to live in subhuman conditions.  <br /> When the onion is peeled back on this story, one finds a close-knit family.  There is little or no evidence of physical or sexual abuse inside the family.  Malachy, the father, was a reader, a good writer and storyteller. During those priceless mornings at the fire, and when he was able to be sober, he sowed these seeds of interest in his children, resulting in Frank's thirst for knowledge, Shakespeare, and writing which took him all the way to a Pulitzer prize.  If Malachie were an executive in the US today, his alcoholism problem would be accepted and treated while he kept his job, provided he had the right health care insurance, of course.  <br /> Frank,  was the entrepreneur in the family making money by deliverng coal, selling papers, reading to the visually impaired, writing threatening letters for the &quot;collection&quot; agency, and delivering telegrams.  His generosity  to his family and his kindness to the old and infirm to which he delivered telegrams tells us he never became hard and indifferent inspite of his own daily hardships.  I'd say his biggest legacy will be in what he passed on to his students all the years he was a teacher in the Stuyvescant High School.  He could slip into the shoes of his students and truly understand their lives.  They would feel and know that Mr. McCourt was on the same page with them.  <br /> This book would be very beneficial as required reading for social workers, teachers, doctors, nurses, clergy, or anyone working with the poor, disenfranchised, refugees or  immigrants.  It would help them to look beyond what they see standing  before them;  and see the person, the family, the lives being lived.  Poverty exists in every country today, including the USA.  These same stories can be heard today in every country where people are out of work, where there is child labor, where there is child abuse, alcohol and other drug problems, and in cities, town and villages  that have Neediest Funds and Toy Drives at Christmas.  Didn't someone say &quot;The Poor Will Always Be With Us?&quot;  <br /> I'd also recommend a brief overview of the History of Ireland for people reviewing this book so they could have an inkling about the social, economic and political conditions in Ireland at that time.   <br /> For people who appreciated this book, another great book  will be coming out in the USA next year.  It is entitled &quot;Are you Somebody,&quot; by Nuala O'Failoin, a young girl growing up in a Dublin family.   Another masterpiece.  Watch for it. <br />                            - 30 -

0812548094|4.0|TOR (the publisher) has discovered yet another goldmine in Goodkind, but after reading this sequel I suspected Robert Jordan from the first.  This is like Wheel of Time with SEX.  It's good, but it's too similar to Wheel of Time...the &quot;Sisters of Light&quot;?  Come on, I hear Aes Sedai coming, and they're not happy.  Goodkind lives up to his name, but like the rest of his books, &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; is a suspicious mix of cliched TOR high fantasy and his own views.<br /> I prefer Goodkind.<br /> The whole violent-sex thing is so refreshing to me, even though Goodkind is right in your face.  High fantasy adheres too rigidly to passive sexual relationships.  Goodkind has read his Freud, and it's one of the few welcome elements of Stone of Tears.  His character development is also good, although I personally am sick of rags-to-riches crap (see:Rand al'Thor).  It's even more annoying if the main character is noble anyways, and he just needs to figure that out.  It's just another formula that Goodkind follows.<br /> And what's with this Gratch thing? A little too smarmy for Rahl...<br /> I can only hope Goodkind finds his own voice, his own world, and quits following in Jordan's footsteps.
0316921173|5.0|Living in an nation where we all share the &quot;inalienable&quot; right and bear the legal burden of an unending &quot;pursuit of happiness,&quot; I feel people have a responsibility to themselves (and others) to set aside 30-50 hours and give David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest a serious read.  Despite the book's imposing girth, a vocabulary that sends the well-read scuttling for a dictionary, several hundred endnotes,  a seemlingly endless disjointed catalog of outlandishly crippled and damaged characters, and the reader's final unsatisfying realizations of dissolution, I haven't felt this strongly about a book for years. <br /> Infinite Jest's characters and plots at first seem foreign and hard to understand, but as the pages turn, they become friends whose dilemmas become more accessible than your own problems.  Characters such as Hal Incandenza, the pot-addicted tennis player who memorizes dictionaries and trapped between the exploded legacy of a father and a terrifyingly pleasant mother; and Don Gately, a heroic square-headed Demerol addict, start out disjointed and at the periphery of the text become the two counterpoints in a story about something larger than their problems.  The Quebecois terrorists in wheelchairs, numerous drug addictions and occasional perversions, feral hamsters, childhood flashbacks, apocalyptic tennis games, and cinema theory all start to come together clearly around page 200 to form a pattern of ideas much greater than the sum of the parts. <br /> With a firm grasp of the innate absurdity of humanity, a ton of pomo irony, a sweeping dystopic vision of a future, and a keen understanding of psychological disorder, Wallace offers an insightful indictment of a society, our society.  It is a place totally disconnected from itself, intrinsically damaged, forcing the inhabitants of this culture to escape into self-feeding forces of further disconnection. Wallace manages to make his point without actually saying it-nowhere in the book doeshe saddle a high horse and beat the reader over the head with his 1000+ pages of prose. Instead, he presents the complex perspectives of impossibly comedic and hurt characters vaguely intertwined in a struggle which is never fully explained and his point is made. <br /> I found the messages of Infinite Jest reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's dystopic observations in his Brave New World. That future of scientific predetermined mindless pleasure, addresses one of today's pressing problems of the role of meaning, truth, and pleasure, in a society continually engaging in acts of diversionary mental masturbation.  It is about freedom gone awry as individuals have lost control.  In writing about the point of Brave New World, Huxley notes: <br /> &quot;The early advocates of [...] a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false.  They did not foresee what in fact has happened [...] the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main with neither the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant.  In a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.&quot; [Brave New World Revisited (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1965), 28-29.] <br /> Both Infinite Jest and Brave New World lack the convenient and centralized evil of Orwell's 1984, only the undefined evil of individual consumers who lose themselves and others as they blindly attempt a futile escape from their culture.  Wallace's vision is much more terrifying, insightful, less preachy, and more believable than Huxley's; delivered as a form of hilarious entertainment; and is worth a serious read. <br />

0807106577|4.0|This book was one of those few to make me laugh out loud until I was crying - the sheer lunacy of this character is absolutely fascinating.  Ignatius is the personification of the obnoxiousness that resides in all of us, and Toole's carefully crafted words paint a vivid picture of New Orleans, Levy Pants, and his mother's house.  His letters to the Minx are somewhat tedious, but humouress nonetheless, his descriptions unique, apt, and crass.  It broke my heart to think of this book's creator defeated by rejection, and missing the celebration of this wonderful book.
0553277472|5.0|The essential how-to for learning to take a mental knife and split reality into new ways of seeing and understanding. An excellent resource on the art of persuasive writing (rhetoric) and communication. Written by an education reformer, it is a wonderful biographical novel, an inspirational travelogue, an introduction to metaphysics and philosophy, a frightening ghost story and mystery. Excellent book to read aloud with teenagers. The best book ever written. <BR> Note: The current editions have an afterword, written years after the original publication of the book. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ADDED.  IT DOES NOT BELONG, AND DESTROYS THE ENDING.  Have someone else cut this out and stuff it into an envelope for you.  Keep it to read a year after you finish the book.

0684874350|5.0|Like all great literature, Angela's Ashes is about more than it seems. Yes, it is about Ireland, poverty, alcoholism, cynical, arrogant priests, the myth of a golden America, sexually coming of age. But what it is essentially and magnificently about is the glory of words, language, stories, the stuff we all carry in our minds to make life bearable. The stories, the language, subvert the best (and worst) intentions of a benighted church and aristrocracy (in the background but always there) to keep the poor and humble docile, stupid and accepting of their miserable lot on earth in hope of salvation in the bye and bye.  A brilliant, life-affirming work.

0195067142|5.0|Very few authors of books on the war in the South Pacific bring the vivid first hand experiences to light the way Dr. Sledge is able to do.  He paints a picture that your mind and spirit is able to see as you read his words. He tells of the funny side of war, if there is one, the emense amount of hard work involved, and the brutality of war as he experienced it. The contrast of fighting on a barren coral rock, as was Peleliu, to the muck and mud of Okinawa is compelling.<br /> As I have been a close personal friend of Dr. Sledge for over 30 years, I have heard many times in his own words the accounts of the battles fought on Peleliu and Okinawa. However, Dr. Sledge, in the words he writes is able to bring the battles to life, and involve the reader as if they were there.  His story is so much like the man he is, strong, well prepared, confident, a believer in God, and willing to go to war for his country and &quot;kill japs&quot;.<br /> Anyone who wishes to gain insight into the nature of the war with the Japanese, and of war in general, needs to read this book.
0425156842|5.0|In an age of thrillers and best-sellers, Gaardner did a remarkable thing: He wrote an original novel, which is both entertaining and highly instructive.<br /> Sophie is about to turn 15 years old when she finds herself involved in a misterious correspondence course on Western Philosophy. At the same time, strange events relate her to an unknown girl, Hilde. Sophie's teacher happens to be the best philosophy teacher one can imagine, a man any reader should yearn to meet and to learn from. More than two thousand years of philosophy are covered in a smooth and rational way, and if this book doesn't get you thinking, maybe you should see someone. The only weak point in the book is the plot, that could be a little better, but maybe that is to demand too much from a book which is already a masterpiece.<br /> Thank you, Mr. Gaarder, I learnt a lot!

Although , this sort of writing is typical to our conscience: a stream that is never stagnant, it is not comprehensive when put on paper ( unless of course we note our own thoughts) I guess it shows that it is never easy to truly decipher the thoughts and reasonings of one another. Woolf is successful in portraying a character if we seperate each section of each part. when she tries to congregate 14 characters (of which 6 are the most important) she really messes up. My advice is if you have a choice-don't go for it! It just gives you headaches!! Well , for me it did!

0679438327|1.0|I have never read a book that I found totally lacking in some small from of enjoyment, until now.  I am not an overly religous person and enjoy a good debate now and again, I am not even offended by what anyone has to say about God.  But I was not ready for the 400+ pages of psudoreligous crap that was thrown in my face with this book, to be honest there were only about 20 or so &quot;good&quot; pages in this entire farce, and in this case the term good is subjective.  I read the Vampire Choronicles because they are fun, this one is not fun.  It is long winded, the charecters are totaly unrealized, Lestat has been turned into a whimpering fool, Armand commits suicide in a totally foolish act of desperation, and I will not mention what a joke every other charecter in this book is.  I wish I could have brung myself to commit suicide like Armand, it would have ended the pain.  Let me finally finish ranting :-), this book is best summed up as a totally self serving attempt at religous debate that has no foundation in the previous books of the series, and Anne has become what most readers fear, FULL OF HERSELF!!
0679731377|5.0|Brilliant, witty, very intelligent... The stories have different moods and subjects, although they are subtily connected by the author, so they are great to be read by their own, and much better once put together. A book to re-read - Very, very entretaining, and at the same time, it speaks about the big subjects: Do we want to go to heaven just to find that the others are not there?  What comes after making a golf course in 18 strokes?  - New interest added to the book by the fact that the CIA has said this week (20.11.97) that they have REALLY have discovered Noe's Arc, a recurrent reference in the book, one of whose charters (n. 9) is dedicated to the search of the Noe's Arc by an astronaut of the NASA... -
0679445099|2.0|Patricia Cornwell has written a good series of books but they seem to be going downhill, including with her latest novel, &quot;Unnatural Exposure.&quot; It is the latest in the Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Scarpetta is the Virginia medical examiner.  When she's good, Cornwell can write some great, engaging, scary stories. But when's she bad, well, it's not pretty. For most of this book, she held my attention. Some of that momentum was kept up, though, by referring to characters and plot lines from the earlier books - as well as putting off some stories for the next one. The plot itself is good: a serial killer is hurting and killing selected people by releasing a mutated version of smallpox. The killer taunts her by sending electronic mail through American On-Line so the FBI tries to trip the killer up by having the real doctor and &quot;deaddoc,&quot; the suspect's on-line name, meet in a chat room so they can trace the call.  While the character of Scarpetta is interesting - it's not everyday that a medical examiner is the heroine - she is getting so hardened on the world (shades of Cornwell's famously guarded personality?) that she is becoming gradually less interesting. More interesting is her niece, Lucy, a computer expert working for the FBI who is being hassled because she is lesbian.  After reading the book, and feeling the desire to throw it against the wall when the suspect was revealed, I checked to see what other readers thought of it by looking at reviews in Amazon.Com. Sure enough, most had the same opinion: this was a book that seemed rushed and is one of her weaker efforts. Several suggested focusing a story around Lucy instead of Kay, which is a pretty good idea. Overall, the characters in her book are becoming less interesting than I'm questioning whether I'll read another Cornwell book.

0140185232|5.0|Published in 1944, The Razor's Edge is prophetically relevant today.  Maugham, a master of insight into human nature, draws characters that, in a deep way, pull at this reader's heartstrings.  Why bother with the metaphysical pedagogue garbage on bookshelves today?  As an art, literature's aim is to explore questions that human beings have, and, in a well done work, provide a hint of an illuminated path.  The path that this novel takes is pure gold.  I am only ashamed that it sat on my bookshelf for so long unread.  P.S.  If anyone reading this review has taken a taxi ride with Larry, email me!
0679720200|4.0|Boy, did you ever just want to shake some life into someone? Camus' character, Mersault is like a walking zombie; everything he does is predictable and then surprising. The short, choppy style of writing in Ward's version is also a paradox. Ward takes you on the straightest, yet most exciting roller coater ride you've ever been on considering the fact that his character doesn't seem to give a darn about most things. You have never met a more honest character than Camus' Mersault. Perhaps this is why Mersault becomes somewhat of a hero rather than just another plebeian character. Camus asks through Mersault, how are we to be significant human beings is we are all supposed to be like one another? Read this book and you'll find out how Mersault knocks off the chains of society. It may be dark, but none the less it is thought provoking and even humorous.

Truly chilling at times.  A masterpiece.
0316920045|4.0|If you love a good linguistic Rorschach, David Foster-Wallace's &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is very much worth reading. All the same, I know folks who simply can't hang after the first fifty pages, so it isn't everybody's cup of tea. Demographically, I would bet enjoyment of this book breaks out along several time-tested human duality's like Mac vs. PC, Thinkers vs. Feelers, Nerds vs. Hipsters, Minimalist vs. Maximalist, and so on. Yet in my experience people come in all combinations of the above, so it is hard to predict who will resonate with this book and who will not. I would say for the person seeking that very elusive combination of artiness, hipness, and serious emotional depth in a concise poetic-form, you won't make it past page 50. But if you're anything resembling a neurotic math geek in rehab trying to work out the crinkles of a truly awful childhood,  David Foster-Wallace has likely got your E-ticket right here baby.  First, ignore the silly comparisons to Pynchon. To me, the book is crisp and readable despite its length, and although many will heap scorn upon Foster-Wallace for all the hyperbolic pharmaceutical jargon, ignore that criticism too because \\"Infinite Jest\\" comes complete with  an appendix of entertaining footnotes to help the reader with background information on concepts and characters in the main text. Overall, the book moves along with an interesting \\"cut and paste\\" montage style with respect to the subplots, and this approach should only present a problem for people who haven't watched MTV. You may have heard alot about how David Foster-Wallace stands the entire concept of the novel on its head etc... but  I didn't find it to be that strange. No, the truly strange part about &quot;Infinte Jest&quot; is how surprisingly small the &quot;core&quot; of the book that actually sticks with you is.  Like real life, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; places an egalitarian sense of timing and importance to all events and characters, so even though it is entertaining to read, some of it is ultimately capricious and requires some serious off-line time to process. While the effect is powerful and life-like in many ways, it does impart a certain fuzziness or depersonalized coldness to the reader as you attempt to bifurcate the stochastic chaff from the wheat in David Foster-Wallace's universe. This is especially true in terms of coherent character development which is to me, possibly the weakest aspect of the book. Sometimes I think this &quot;style&quot; was an intentional metastatement of some kind, but at other times I don't. I guess I'd like to think the &quot;heart&quot; of this book comes from a person who has inhabited many of the feelings experienced by the book's characters, and in that light, \\"Infinite Jest\\" takes on a more confessional tone. Perhaps Foster-Wallace himself has a history of substance abuse and this book is about working some things out for himself too. Who knows. I suppose by its very size and obliqueness, there is a kind of intellectual defensiveness to the book itself that seems, at least in part, a kind of personal thing. One must wonder: What demon was Foster-Wallace exorcising himself with &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;?  On the other hand, the most conceptually compelling aspect of the book for me was the  substitution of an &quot;entertainment&quot; cartridge for physical addiction (although television consumption is darn close already...) and, the intriguing use of neonatal nystagmus as part of the visually addictive quality. This allowed the author to say something very sad and universal about separation anxiety, and in doing so,  I think David Foster-Wallace has done a powerful and original job of  illuminating the dark potential for addiction in all of us. So this is reasonably deep stuff. But you do need to wade through some quasi-peripheral material to get to it.  So was it worth reading? For me, yes. I found &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; downright fun. Could it have been done better in fewerwords with a more satisfying development? Possibly. George Saunders (&quot;Bounty&quot;) packs nearly as much soul and dystopian bizzarity into fifty pages as Foster-Wallace does in 500. But I think Foster-Wallace certainly has the edge on Saunders in the goofy verbal fun department. Goofy Verbal Fun seems to be the best reason to read this book. I guess one might hope that David Foster-Wallace has written the longest book of his life and from now on,  perhaps strive to say more with a little less. He's got ideas, talent, and time, so anything is possible. Entertaining as it is, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; isn't the one book I would take with me to that proverbial desert island. Desert islands, like life perhaps, ultimately require one to separate the kitsch from the soul food. With &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, Foster-Wallace has served-up a monumental kitsch-fillet with a reasonably soulful sauce. My advice: bite, chew, repeat.

0816174865|5.0|I had heard this book was impressive and I have to agree. Clarke's masterpiece was a brilliant journey to the father planet as well as a fascinating look inside the world of interplanetary travel. His ability to place the future away from the present yet make it plausible is just one of the things that define him as a mater of science-fiction. In addition to his well-laid plot, characterization is fine. He could have use one or maybe two more main characters to break up the journey to Jupiter. I can't think of any other sci-fi novelist who could have handled a period of time like that as well as Clarke did. The confrontation with the monoliths defined humanity's boundaries as well as its will to reach further. Bowman was a fine character to become the Star Child for he was alone yet could reach out to the world. Although I have not yet seen the movie, I can't wait to see how Kubrick has handled the awesome task presented by Clarke.
0684874350|3.0|I read Angela's Ashes at the behest of my sister who raved until I could resist no more.  She sent it to me and there it sat; naturally I picked it up and was drawn into the beautiful writing and entertaining stories - as has been every person I know who has read it.  It was a very good read.<br />However, when I reflected on the book I started to feel Mr. McCourt had overly romanticized a grueling and cruel childhood.  I began to recall the tone and flavor of Roddy Doyle's books &quot;Paddy Clarke- Ha Ha Ha&quot; and &quot;The Woman who Walked into Doors&quot;, two novels which deal with a similar subject matter.  Those books went so much deeper to reveal the heavy oppression and despair of poverty in Catholic Ireland.  I would highly recommend both books to anyone who wants a more realistic and truthful portrayal of the Irish Catholic experience.<br />I find it hard to believe that a childhood such as that told by Mr. McCourt can be both a revealed truth and so completely anecdotal and humorous.  There is not expressed the pain in the child that I firmly believe must be there.  Surely there resides in him a core of damage and a modicum of bitterness that, unexplored and unrevealed, will not go away.<br />It reminds me of a Hollywood movie with a happy ending.  It makes one feel good, but is it true?   I have read many reviews of this book and have not heard this criticism raised.  I wonder if anyone else feels as I do about the book.  <br />Comments?
0553103547|5.0|George R. R. Martin did a magnifacent job in this book.  'A Game of Thrones' can easily be rated up with such classic works such as Dickens and is at the top of all Fantasy authors.  Even though he portrays the book in seven different view points it is still captivating and you love all of the characters.  aGoT has knights, kings, queens, ladies, lords, bastards, wizards, you name it and it has it.  There are a lot of books that have these types of characters, but this one is truly original.  If you don't like graphic material, such as sex and violence, and are wary about reading this book, you should read it anyway just for the sure beauty of his style of writing and the plot.  He is constantly pulling something new that you would not have expected and always keeping you on the end of your seat.  A must read for anyone interested in the noble lords and ladies of medieval times, or the fantasy lover or the fiction lover.  This novel can easily be enjoyed by all readers.

I learned a little about the men who were drafted and those who chose military careers, then how they went to war, performed under extreme pressure, perservered under incredible situations and died under worse, and returned whole or shattered, dead or alive, to their now-distant homeland. A welcome afterword section also introduced me to some of the people who waited stateside only to have to learn to live without their soldiers. Now I understand military teamwork, hierarchy, politics, protocol. Now I am glad I was never expected to serve, yet grateful that these authors so vividly recounted their experiences, making them real for me.

0517543052|5.0|&quot;Be Here Now&quot; is unique-- it's *the* basic introduction to eastern religion, written for any American who wants to put sincere spiritual idealism into practice in their own life. My friends in high school in the 1970s used to call this book &quot;The Hippie Bible.&quot; (What a happy development that our country has opened up to the point where most anyone can feel comfortable reading it.)
094113086X|5.0|Sister Mary ***** read this book aloud to our 8th grade class 20 years ago and I had forgotten it until I saw a review last month.  As you have read in these reviews, the story is great, but it is made more so by the layers of onion skin surrounding it:  the ghost writer discovers the story whilst he is searching for Yeti stories (which appear near the end of the book), an American spy on the team?  no other mention of Rawicz has appeared in the press.  Is he still alive?  In the (gold) vein of Endurance, My Journey to Lhasa, 7 Years in Tibet.  Don't start this book when you have something else important to do.

0446604844|2.0|About the only thing good about this book was it helped pass the time during a roundtrip flight between Dallas-Chicago. Otherwise, it was populated by the usual suspects: 1 lawyer who works for a high powered law firm that is dependent upon one client, a poorly paid G-man, and a powerful, corrupt executive (of a firm or a nation). He's like Grisham in that now that I've tried it, I won't return.

0452279178|2.0|Imagine a Louis L'Amour Western that wasn't lean and didn't get up and go to work on every page.  Instead it sat around eating pizza and ice cream, putting on layers of rolling, superfluous fat, while watching &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; for eight or nine years in a row and gradually becoming warped psychologically.  That's Wizard and Glass.<br />It's a fairly typical saga of three young kids who, in classic Scooby-Doo fashion, prove to be too meddling for the evil wrongdoers of a small town, with our hero, Roland, cast as the leader of the group. <br />The book has serious flaws -- as others have mentioned, a 500+ page flashback is far too much for a critical reader to swallow without making a face -- but the worst problem of the book is its plot, which is simply unnecessary. <br />Our hero's goals are simple: nibble a tasty morsel named Susan, foil the bad guys, and make it home safe.  All of this could have been accomplished had Roland and Company simply returned to Gilead with Susan, reporting their critical spy-type data about the enemy's plans, in the first five chapters. <br />However, King conveniently ignores this simple, tidy solution and leads us through a blubbery whale-intestines maze of a plot for 500 more pages for no apparent reason.  <br />Other problems: the girl meets a pointlessly cruel, brutal fate, the language is worse than usual for King, the villains are never satisfactorily repaid (what of Rhea, the worst villain of all?) and certain major characters just vanish with no explanation (Sheemie, for instance). <br />King says in his afterword that 400 pages in he lost all sense of perspective.  I agree.Reader, do yourself a favor and skip this in favor of a book with a more rational storyline.  If you want an exciting, long Western with a strong hero, an interesting romance, and an interesting subplot featuring mysticism, read L'Amour's Jubal Sackett.
0451169514|5.0|I'll just say this, When I went to bed at night, I wouldn't even sleep with the book in my house.  I would run into the backyard, and hurl the book way out onto the lawn.  I wouldn't retrieve it until the sun came up the next day!
044651506X|5.0|This book made me laugh hard and even made me sad at one point.  It gave a nice history of Eastern LI as well.  Its treasure hunting twist made the story very exciting because of the way it was juxtaposed against the animal disease background (two completely different motives).  The ending with the speed boats was overdone for a novel, but I really enjoyed it anyway and could easily see it fitting well in Hollywood.

0679735909|5.0|Although at times I questioned whether I was even going to make it through this book, it became one of the most rewarding experiences of my reading life.  Byatt weaves a classic love story that becomes a complex tapestry of utter delight.  One of the most rewarding chapters in the novel was one that I approached with much trepidation--the multiple-page chapter of the correspondence between the 2 19th century lovers.  I was plowing through it, when suddently I became utterly absorbed and amazed at what Byatt was doing--going from cold respectability to intense and troubled passion is simply astounding.  A. S. Byatt is truly in total charge of her medium in this wondrous novel.
0316920045|5.0|I thought the book was great. The huge size and interminable length made it all the better. I was, to say the least, very impressed by Wallace's skill. His stylistic ability, his creative flare, his sheer story-telling ability, and his originality all attest to his power as a novelist. Reading Infinite Jest was one of the more fun things that I have done. It took me a while, but in the end I have to say that I enjoyed the novel  more than most books that I have read. The realism of both the halfway house and the tennis academy struck me especially. Wallace made these two places seem convincingly real. The characters(eventhe more bizarre ones) all seemed like people whom I knew by the end of the novel. The first 50-60 pages of the book were difficult to get into, but once past that point, the book becomes quite easy. The narratives embrace the reader, pulling him through the pages by the hundred. The endnotes made the book even more enjoyable. The novel itself was funny, sad, tragic, sickening, and very weird. The one flaw that I found with the book was its complete lack of closure. The ending left too many issues unresolved. How did Hal ingest the DMZ? What happens to Gately? What happens to the rest of Enfield Tennis Academy? Does the AFR ever find the Entertainment? These questions still plague me. However, I thought that the book on a whole was a masterwork; Wallace shows much promise for the future.
0060976624|5.0|Completely hilarious and far more insightful about  contemporary politics than anything you'll find on the editorial page.
0679457313|4.0|This is an outstanding maiden effort. I found the book a compelling and interesting read. The author does a good job characterising the people in the story, especially the twins Estha and Rahel. As a result, readers are actually able to really empathise for them. The author also does great in  playing around with various words and expressions, and in slowly unfolding the mystery. Because the story moves from past to present, I got confused at some parts, but this adds to the suspense that is felt and maintained, especially towards the second half. All in all, this book does deserve the Booker Prize.
0606049134|4.0|The story of Billy Pilgrim as he views his life through a variety of time perspectives.  He relives his terrible experiences in World War II and the Dresden firebombing.  These experiences are contrasted with those of a idealistic alien race where there is peace.  The writing style was unusual but engrossing.
0316920045|5.0|This is the greatest 450 pages of fiction I've read--the problem is I'm not halfway done with the book yet.  There are 100 pages of footnotes to boot!  This guy is too original for words.  He is a genius at the art of the context switch, changing voices as easily as I do my socks.  Whether or not he's really been a drug addict or a tennis prodigy, he talks about those worlds as if he's lived them many times over.  But the plot meanders without taking you with it, there is no story buildup, just a seemingly endless enumeration of scenes, the connections among which are only now starting to hint at themselves.  I'll hang with it until I finish.  It is stimulating, thought-provoking, real, moving, and hilarious, but not what you'd call a pot-boiler.
0345350472|3.0|As most people, I read this book after seeing the movie bladerunner.  I guess I expected more out of it.  It was an emjoyable read but i have to admitt I think Ridley Scoots adaptation was more artististic.  For anyone who enjoyed the movie, this is a good book, but for the first time even, i liked the movie more.  Do read it if you liked the story line to bladerunner, but be prepared for a difference if it was the wit and language you enjoyed in the movie.
6304432453|4.0|&quot;Strange Days&quot; is a fast-paced thriller that got very little recognition from the critics.  Perhaps that's because, although full of action, it doesn't have enough gore or car ripper scenes to please thriller movie seekers.  Except for the occasional nudity, and frequent hard language, this movie may have been better off being released as a television movie.  All the same, the video is a good one to pick up for home viewing, especially after the kids are tucked away in bed for the night.  Ralph Fiennes, generally known for his dark, moody roles, pulls off the character of Lenny to the point of charming.  Angela Bassett is buff and tuff and wonderfully suited for her role as Mace. I had a bit of a problem with Juliette Lewis in the role of Faith, although I can't put my thumb on the reason why.  The rest of the cast were well suited for their roles.  Although dark and sometimes depressing, &quot;Strange Days&quot; is still worth settling down with a soda and bowl of buttered popcorn.  Don't let the widescreen format scare you away; it's amazing how fast you get used to it.  END
0441003257|5.0|This book has to be the best thing ever put into words, but what could be expected from two of the best fantasy/comady authors ever.

0131103628|5.0|This is a no-nonsense intro to C.  Contrary to some opinions, I think it is a good book to learn from for its brevity and  straightforwardness.  However, if you are considering C++, read Bjarne Stroustrup's book on C++ instead.
0273617109|4.0|Ms. Minto's book is a classic example of a gem in the rough.  Yes, it isn't visually impressive, and yes it is well worth using.  Note that I said using, not reading.  You won't realize the value of the methods Ms. Minto presents if you don't try them out; repeatedly. <br />My suggestion?  Go to the chapters that contain examples first, and read them thoroughly. Then find a short report or memo you find particularly opaque, and read the book cover to cover, occasionally referring to your example.  Finally, go back to those sections of The Pyramid Principle that apply to the example you found and start re-working it per Ms. Minto's methods.<br />When you're done, do it again, with another piece.  Then re-read the book at least once a year.  It's worth it.  <br />Anyone can build a jumbled pile of stones.  It takes time and practice to build an orderly structure that will stand on its own  merits.  The Pyramid Principle will help you become a verbal architect.  I think it is well worth using!

0671891634|5.0|Much of what Peter Lynch says in this book is perhaps fairly straightforward for a professional equities analyst - and some of it isn't. For the novice he explains in detail his rationale behind stock picks for Magellan, and for the &quot;expert&quot; he blows away a few myths on ratios, technical analysis and other mechanical means to asses stocks. All the way through the book he reiterates that fundamental analysis is what he based his stock picks on, and that reasonably interested personal investors can do it as well if not better than the professionals. There are no gimmicks, and no &quot;theory&quot; (cf. Soros on Soros), just an explanation of how one of the best fund managers of all time did his homework.
0440217563|5.0|Voyager was just as good as the first two. I hated having to put this book down. This book draws you so completely I wish I could be there with the characters. I enjoy the fact that Ms. Gabaldon has done a lot of research on her facts. Her books draw me so, that I would love to go Scotland and see it's beauty and learn all it's history from that time. I would love to have a love that knew no time or space. I would and have recommended her books to anyone. I hope she writes a fifth one in her series. If you have not read the fourth book it's a must.
0679442790|4.0|Schlink's prose is sparse yet evocative. There are just enough (and not too many) details to allow us to imagine the scenes. The major moral question, which re-occurs in each section, is &quot;What would you have done?&quot; That ever-present, hovering, issue is smaller and larger than it first appears. It is smaller because it could be said to apply only to those characters under the novel's novel circumstances. It is also a small issue when we think of the horrendous immoral behavior done to the Jewish vistims.  It is larger, because the issue really applies to each and every one, all, of the German people, in effect showing what each did or did not do as effector or seeming bystander.
0679442790|5.0|This novel uses a unique love story to remind the reader not only of the horrows but the legal issues of the Holocost. Suberbly crafted and excellent read
067158037X|5.0|I have just listened to Angela's Ashes for the third time.What a heart wrenching story of the McCourt family so well expressed by the author himself with his Irish accent  the songs he sings.  If anyone thinks  their own childhood suffered,  then read the story of the McCourt family's desperation  and you will, like myself, feel you were privileged. What a magnificent book. I have recommended it to all my friends and am anxiously awaiting the sequel to this tragic but beautiful story.
0679457313|2.0|One can compare The God of Small Things very well with another novel by another author of Indian origin, The Shadow Lines by Amitav Ghosh. Similar storylines - small lives, juxtaposed with history unfolding on a larger canvas on which the protagonists have no control but are nevertheless sucked into, creating a concoction that bursts suddenly without warning on the face, changing a few lives forever. Unfortunately, that is where the comparison ends. While Ghosh allows his pen to flow with the conviction of the master who knows exactly which words should come in where - just so - Roy's effort appears labored, staccato, and directionless. Roy even tries to use (most probably unknowingly) a style similar to that of Ghosh - the sense of foreboding of events that are to come, but fails there too. You are not even 50-75 pages into the book, when you know exactly what is going to happen and how - and even who are to be involved. And finally, when Roy does tell us what happened, she isn't too sure whether we are going to catch what she is trying to say, and therefore has to spell it out. Puhlease!  And then, there's the style. Sorry, Style! In a deliberate attempt to break tradition, Roy Indulges in it. And how! One remembers Godard's classic film &quot;Breathless&quot; where he goes against every rule in the book to create his own. And then imagine Mrinal Sen trying to copy that style....  I have nothing against the book - best of luck to Roy for all its multiple million (dollar/ copies?) success, but is it what the Booker is all about?
0345389409|1.0|I read this book a while ago.  In fact I was practically the first at the bookstore to pick up a copy because I love Rice's vampire works.  More importantly I love her characters dearly.  If you do also, don't bother with this book!  If you expect to read a vampire book, don't bother with this book.  If you expect to read a riveting adventure tale, don't bother with this book.<br /> This is probably the first of Rice's books that undeniably demonstrates the total lack of editorial control over her work.  Perhaps a good editor might have suggested a more believable approach, a swifter pace, less whining and--most importantly!--different characters!  But Rice will not allow a word of her ramblings to be altered from their original form, and the fact that her ego and success are destroying what was once a phenomenal talent is agonizingly obvious.  In Memnoch she drags a beloved hero and company through philosophical mud and grants them all the tangible reality of cardboard cutouts (or kills them off outright) in a story that goes on and on and on to arrive absolutely nowhere.  The worlds she has managed to build to impressive proportions in four previous books, she tears down in this one.<br /> Like I (and many, many others) said: don't bother with this book; it's not worth the paper used to produce it.

0679731725|5.0|The Remains of the Day is said to be a retrospection on the life of a staid English butler.  And so it is.<br />  But it is also a thought-provoking introspection about the role that each of us plays in the world.  Is it enough to merely do our job to perfection?  Or is more asked of us?  How will we feel when we look back on our lives from near the end?  <br />  One of my favorite books.

0880381736|5.0|Dragons once again plague the land of Krynn. Rumors of war are spreading like fire through a grass field.  There will be a special meeting on Krynn like there hasn't been for thousands of years. Eight people from across Krynn come together for a reason they do not know and could not understand.  Little do they know they will become companions for the rest of their lives... Battling dragons, the awful race of draconians birthed from the dark arts of Takhisis' clerics,  hobgoblins and ogres alike, the companions live through it all.They go through all of this to posess the famed Blue Crystal Staff. Death, darkness, love, hate. All of these follow the companions like a tracker on a trail.  I give this book a 10 all the way because of all this. Adventure, drama, tragedy, this book has it all. If you like fantasy, you will love this book as much as I did.
0060975768|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It will make difficult reading, I think, for anyone without some war experience.  The author did a wonderful job of distinguishing for the reader what the soldiers knew at the time and what is now known about the battle.
0385472951|3.0|The first moment I laid my eyes on this particular book I felt in love with its catchy cover.The beginning of the book proved to be really exciting and total can't-put-down.As the story develops I found it more and more difficult to believe that such a crime or tall-tale can be dealt with. I mean, seriously how many of the white-collar pimps out there could manage to escape every single charges rested upon him. It's just too easy. Too easy and absurd from the likes of John Grisham. Though it's not a total let down, judging from his previous writings, I still find that it could have been better.I'm 15 and love reading on stuff like this alike. (Mr.Grisham, if you reading this i hope you not angry). This last book of yours made reading Goosebumps at night a plesure.
0312955006|5.0|I was browsing through Amazon for new mystery writers and happened upon Connelly. Those who have  rated his writings a 10, have not erred, in my estimation. I generally read an hour or two to get drowsy and fall asleep each night. Once I started The Concrete Blonde, I got no sleep. I finished the book in a day and a half. Reminds me of a good movie you want to see again and again. I've picked up my second Connelly book and will start it tonight.

0440111498|5.0|Vonnegut leaves the United States to see what the world really looks like. And San Lorenzo is our own world-in-a-bottle. Leaders prosecuting religion, but are themselves believers, a prophet whose name and message are misunderstood, a scientist working without regard to the outcome of his work. The people are ignorantly content with their lot, nobody wants to rule, and it is not technology that makes people happy, but basic physical contact. Vonnegut leads us into this miniverse of men, and through his eyes we appreciate the folly of being, the indifference of science, religion and man himself to the fate of the world. We become uncaring Bokononists, happy with the optimistic lies we daily tell ourselves. The destruction of this world is, of course, in a whisper, not in a bang. And even then nothing really changes, does it? Anyone for Foma?
0140186395|5.0|If you love drama, or don't get enough in your real life, this book is filled with it.  From the beginning you meet two families, one of course is the soul of the book.  This of course is the Trask family.  First you meet Adam, he of course is this first son, also symbolizing religious aspects.  Then you meet his charming bride Kate.  If ever there was a bad seed, here it is. By book 2 of East of Eden, the two boys are born.  This being Cal and Aaron.  Two handsome twins, that in reality are nothing alike. Finally book 3.  This is where the James Dean movie comes in.  But as usual, this book is not given proper justice in the movie.  The total irony of the end, is a complete surprise, and by the end you want more. If ever their was a dysfunctional family, you meet it in the Trask's.  I loved this book and can read it over and over again.  It is completely unlike his other novels, such as The Pearl, or The Grapes of Wrath.  It actually has a little bit of bittersweet justice, that we all have a tendency to enjoy.
0553573403|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was so powerful and gripping.  It's one of the best books I've read in years -- I, like everyone else, am waiting VERY impatiently for the 2nd book in the series! aGofT has a few weak points -- from the author of &quot;Sandkings&quot;, I had expected some parts to be a bit spookier -- but those weak points are better than the best writing of the majority of Fantasy writers out there.  Read this book, but be prepared to be reading continuously for a few days, losing sleep and work time!
0452270073|5.0|Readers who want a fictionalization of Paul Fussell's &quot;The Great War and Modern Memory&quot; should look no further.  This slender novel captures the essential cultural impact of World War I--the destruction of sincere discourse.  Barker's economical style is ideally suited to the material, although at times I wished she would probe her characters a bit further.  While her reticence is fatal to the other two books in the trilogy, it works here, perhaps because Rivers is such a wonderful, complex personality.  A haunting experience, and worth every bit of the discomfort it causes.
0553455532|4.0|I couldn't put this one down, however, I was disappointed by the ending because I don't read very many books and I was non-stop reading this one to the end.  What a letdown.  But, there was a single phrase that tipped me off to the ending, looking back, now.... While reading, I was confused by that line but I believe it was a forshadowing...but a very subtle one.  ... I was proud of myself for catching that but still very upset with the ending.

It's just ridiculous!
044651652X|1.0|I very rarely read a book which I feel insults my intelligence.  It seems that Waller took some kind of warped demographic poll and wrote down what he thought women would be moved by-cheesy, tragic, doomed romance.  There were a few passages I admired, but on the whole, it was awful.  As a woman, I felt manipulated, stereotyped, and offended.  As a writer, I felt hope that I too might one day be published-after all, Waller was.
044022165X|5.0|John Grisham's novels always have me laughing out loud; up all night; and I simply cannot put them down until I finish them! When I found out that there was going to be a movie I HAD to read it again. I cannot wait to see the movie, although Grisham's books are so descriptive that the movie is playing in my head as I am reading. I can picture every character and what they look like in my head, so the movie's characters are bound to be a disappointment. No other author has captured my undivided attention like John Grisham has in EVERY ONE of his books. Those who criticize him, need to re-read the book and this time PAY ATTENTION! In my opinion, The Rainmaker and A Time To Kill are his very best!

0345315227|2.0|Hmmm. Clarke is probably one of the best writers this century in any genre. However I have to ask - did he really write it or was it ghost written? I quite enjoyed the overall read but the book didn't hang together well. As for the end, I turned the page for the next chapter to be confronted by no more story! It was as if Arthur suddenly got bored and just stopped! <br /> 2001 was excellent, 2010 and 2061 were both innovative and well written, this however quite frankly is very poor, and better he should have not written it than given us this. Maybe I'm too harsh, but we have come to expect from Clarke a certain imagination that allows us to believe in what he says. It's not coincidence that much of what he predicts happens as those inventors probably read Clarke as boys, and were spured on by their own imagination and Clarkes belief. <BR> Sorry but this only gets a 3 out of deference to all his past unsurpassable works.
015626224X|5.0|The prose is clear.  The prose is compelling.  The author's stories are irresistable.  Despite your high school teacher's raves about 1984, Orwell was a much better essayist than a novelist.  This collection is superb.

Those who are my age know that we witnessed this war daily and only through the cynical eye that resided in our living rooms. What General Moore accomplishes in this book is no small feat: He is able to humanize the American soldiers who fought in  Vietnam - something that was not done while the war was moving to its cacaphonous crescendo.  I was not there and will never know the horror they lived through or died experiencing but Gen. Moore's story often brought tears to my eyes.  It also brought a repentence to my soul for I will never again embrace the belief that our soldiers were inhuman tools of destruction instead of people who had friendships, families and lives.

In the ROLLING STONE interview with Anne Rice that came out around the time of the book's release, it was revealed that Ms. Rice wrote the novel in a span of about four weeks; anyone reading the novel will be able to know that on instinct.  Furthermore, to even call this a novel is stretching it too far.  This &quot;book&quot; is nothing more than the pseudo-theological ramblings of a person who has come to view her position as a writer as indestructible, and laying this work out for the general public to buy under the impression that it is another Vampire Chronicle is misleading and greedy.  The plot is barely there, the characters are boring, and the overall tone of the book was so dull that I haven't been inspired to buy or read the two books that followed this one.  If Anne Rice wanted to write a book about what she thought the afterlife would be like, she should have promoted it as nonfiction, not the fifth &quot;Vampire Chronicle&quot;.
006091307X|5.0|&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; slowly unfolds into a conspiracy theory so crazy it just might be true. After reading it, I started looking for signs of its truth, and, either it is true, or fans of the novel have planted the signs themselves. Maybe both. <br /> Not just a paranoid lark, though, &quot;49&quot; is a wonderful satire of power structures. Like the best cyberpunk novels (Stephenson, Gibson), the satire is not so broad that it slaps you in the face immediately. But by the time you get to &quot;KCUF&quot; radio, you're pretty sure that not everything is meant to be taken at face value :-) <br /> Maybe it's the fact that we're recycling a lot of 70s culture now, but the satire doesn't seem that dated. Like Swift, it ages well. <br /> If you've been afraid of Pynchon for his pop-yet-pomo reputation, try this one out.
0671004107|4.0|I saw the movie and immediately got the book.  Overall, the book is better.  But I thought that the character of Ellie was weaker in the book.  I thought Jodie Foster was great in the movie, but in the book, the character isn't very interesting.  But the book is great anyways.  Really recommend it.
0060273232|5.0|Fantasy is a wonderful subject and this book has loads of fantasy!<br /> Not only is the dead coming back to life, but they're making chaos and only one family stands up to it. The Abhorsens.<br /> Sabriel, a young girl that has been ushered away to a boardingschool away from her home and father never really knew love or big responsibilities or that one day she'd be slaying the dead.<br /><br />One day, her father doesn't come for a visit and a dead messenger comes with his sword and the sacred bells and all of a sudden Sabriel knows she must go into the heart of evil and slay the dead to save her father if he's still alive...<br /><br />Sabriel, a daring, beautiful young girl with feelings and pains go with her &quot;cat&quot; Meggot and Touchstone, a prince.<br /><br />The author puts feeling in his character and all of a sudden you're there!

0446310786|5.0|There have been countless reviews, articles and thesis papers written on this timeless book, so I leave the lengthy reviews to the professionals.  Suffice it to say that there are reasons why certain books like &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; &quot;Catch 22&quot; and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; are considered classics in 20th century literature. This is just a remarkable piece of work. <br /> The only negative:  you will cringe the next time you see people call books by Ann Rice and Tom Clancy &quot;must reads.&quot;  This book DEFINED that term! If you're not forced to read this book by High School, TRANSFER!
0451191935|5.0|I first read these books soon after they were published under the Bachman pseudonym.  I have read each of the novellas twice and recently read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; for a third time.  I also just read all of the reviews other readers have sent in to Amazon.com.  For all of you who have panned these literary works, go back to King's Introduction and look at the timeframe these novels were written in.  He began &quot;Rage&quot; in high school and finished it just after college. He wrote &quot;The Long Walk&quot; during his first two years of college.  This guy is a literary genius!  To think that he could get so deep at an age when most young men (myself included) are killing millions of brain cells each week with booze or chasing skirts, just shows the depth of his imagination and ability to keep you hanging on every word.  A must-read for King fans, and sure to be enjoyable for all others!
0962344702|3.0|Readers will be pleased with this book if they are interested with the design of the Alien film not so much the theme of the film or Giger's art. The book is set up in pseudo biographical form that records the chain of events that led up to the production of the Alien film, through the eyes of Giger. While it does contain many of Giger's paintings they are not the center of the book rather than a means of describing film design and offering a contrast between Giger's vision and the outcome of the film.

0679457313|5.0|You never get a feeling of reading a debut writer's book. Arundhati Roy is a gifted writer who plays with words like noone earlier in the literature. Definitely not even Salman Rushdie! I'm dying to read her next book. Will she oblige her fans?
0312955006|3.0|Connelly's detective, Harry Bosch, is the same stereotype we've seen for decades. Nothing creative here. The whodunnit plot follows the usual path: crime, suspect, surprising twist or two, dramatic and personal near-disaster in which our hero hopes to save the girl, a bigger twist and the dramatic conclusion in which the whole thing is revealed for those who didn't keep up as it unfolded. Several plot elements are completely implausible. For example, about 1/3 of the book is spent on an early suspect based only on a hunch and a cursory investigation. This adds pages but no substance to the story. The plot involves a courtroom element throughout, and this is well-presented. All my criticisms aside, I found that I just had to know what would happen next, and kept on turning pages, even as I laughed at the many implausibilities. It's a mediocre detective story patterned after the &quot;classic&quot; Chandler novels, and the fact that I like it is more a complement to the genre than to Connelly.
014032870X|4.0|It is a great story, with my favourite part being the part where the Glass Elevator went into space.Even though it wasn't as good as the first story(Charlie and the Chocolate Factory)It is a great story all the same.

0804102988|5.0|Bought this book in Glasgow in 1992 and am now reading it for the 4th time.  Wonderful detail and animation make you want to read paragraphs over again before moving on!

0440111498|4.0|i just finished cat's cradle last night. although i amonly 16 yrs old i believe that i could capture all the brilliance of this work as any other adult. i believe that cat's cradle is exponentially better that some ofhis other works like s-house 5 or deadeye dick. vonnegut may leave some of his humor aside, but replacesit with a handful of more irony and morality. i thinkthat the book was written primarily by vonnegut to question the morality of science and religion. he makesa mockery of both with bokonism and ice-9. i'm writingmy junior research paper on it tonight, and am extremelyhappy this was my choice because vonnegut's writing isextremely didactic as it preaches us the harms of ourown sacred social institutions.
067158037X|5.0|Since I've been buried in graduate school for the past year, I actually hadn't heard of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; before I picked it up in a London bookshop.  Two pages in, I knew I loved this book. Traveling on the train and ferry to Ireland one weekend, countless people came up to me when they saw me reading the book and told me how much they enjoyed it.  I was so impressed with the way McCourt is able to adopt the voice of a young boy while still communicating so clearly to the reader.  His story and writing style are truly remarkable.
1568491581|5.0|Few books have caught me the way this book did.  Many of the other reviews you will read about this book discuss its simplicity, Christian or Puritan themes, etc.  What I can say, however, is that The Road Less Travelled has a warmth, and assurance about it that makes one feel at ease with change.  It provides a road map (structure) to life that really helped me tremendously.  In particular, the section on religion and faith gave me new insights into spirituality.  I feel much more in touch with my spirituality after reading this book.  It is not a Bible, as some see it, but this book is extremely valable, and one to be treasured.  Its insights are truly useful.  Read, and enjoy, and read again.
0688101364|5.0|I have made over half of the recipes in this book and every one is excellent.  The directions are clear and concise and easily followed by even the novice cook.  Pictures of each cookie make it clear how they should appear and give you interesting decorating tips.  I particularly appreciated the storage and freshness keeping information.  Tips on shipping cookies is also included.   For the experienced baker the gingerbread cathederal challange awaits.  If you want to win friends and gain a reputation as a prize baker, this is the book for you.
0394573439|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in the world.  I was riveted by the way in which Ishiguro captured the butler's language and way of thinking.  He writes with such subtlety that he leaves many things unstated, which makes the reader identify all the more with the butler's regrets as he looks back on his life.  It is fascinating but tragic to see the way in which the butler deceived himself for so many years, putting his master's needs ahead of his own because he was convinced he was working for someone noble and good.  Realizing later on that his master was not noble is painful for him and for the reader.  Read this book.
0393314804|5.0|Brilliant book, I`m from Scotland so I understand the book 100%...I`m sure foreigners might have some trouble understanding the dialect but it shows poverty up in British cities for what it is...bleak with a sense of irony. Cheers Irvine! COLIN STEAD
0061008079|5.0|One of two top novels. Emma Harte is my favorite fiction character. I read this book many years ago and it still remains on the top of my list. As a young woman I was interested in climbing the road to success. Emma Harte's story was an inspiration. I identified with her obsticales, and cheered her success. Every female should read this novel.
0070511136|5.0|I can honestly say that this book doubled my income!  I was introduced to the SPIN Selling by a consulting firm, where I was helping launch a new employee selection program.  The most amazing result is that prospects now ASK me to write up the order.  I don't get the objections and resistance that sales people dread.  I now use these techniques in the fields Real Estate and Life Insurance.  Although designed for large, industrial sales situations, SPIN Selling would be equally effective selling cars or home appliances.  You might also use it at your next job interview or performance evaluation.  You will like the results!
0517591812|2.0|What's the point. A dash of white hair, webbed fingers, ...? I kept waiting for a reason - never got it. Starts off interesting enough, lots of history. About half way through one begins to get impatient. With a hundred pages to go, one wonders if it will ever end. Nevertheless, it's a great way to put yourself to sleep at night. More effective than melatonin.
0060174900|5.0|I could never find words beautiful enough to describe this book.  It changed my life.  I own over 20 copies of it, different editions and forms.  Anyone who likes Plath or this book should take the time to read her poetry as well.  &quot;Ariel&quot; is a good book of poetry to start with.
0451191153|2.0|Understanding that Ayn Rand lived under Communism, I canaccept her radicalism. I would not, however, encourage anybody else towallow, or, perhaps more appropriately, exult in it.<br /> Perhaps the philosophical ideas presented in the work have some merit, but Rand's style makes this book into a literary atrocity. Rand takes seven hundred pages to build one theme, and to build it to lengths that might just drive a reader to insanity.<br /> It's a simple enough story; you have a hero, Howard Roark, the architect-genius who is, at his core, an artist who will not betray his artistic and individualistic credos (how swell), his romantic counterpart, a thin, knife-like woman (Rand sparing no time on subtlty) who, concurrently, seems to love Howard and want to destroy him. In the background revolve several characters who are, to varying degrees, sucked into evil through conformity. Not too bad. The problem? This book hits you like a hammer on the head.
1563523302|4.0|A millionaire is someone who may afford a higher style of life than most people can even dream . Working hard and staying away from the pleasures that money allows is not being a millionaire. A true millionaire keeps it coming. It is a way of life not a purpose in  life (making a million).
1563523302|5.0|I finished this book in one weekend -- I have to admit the topic had me absolutely mesmerized from the start!  I've finally got the answer to the key financial question I've been contemplating for some time:  Am I really headed in the right direction financially?  And how do I compare to the folks who have already accomplished the same goals I'm pursuing?<br />  I found that the case studies of the Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs) -- folks who've achieved a net worth of $1M or more -- to be quite fascinating.  These people are by and large &quot;just regular folks&quot; -- except that they haven't concentrated on accumulating the external trappings of so-called wealth that many of the assumed &quot;well-to-do&quot; Americans (the vast universe of Underachievers of Wealth, or UAWs) have been chasing . The authors' message?  If you work relatively hard, live below your means, and use the compounding power of time as your ally, you will eventually accumulate extensive wealth.  Nothing our parents or grandparents haven't already told us -- but now, here's definite proof their soothsaying had and still has merit.<br />  And this isn't all just some fancy economists' theory.  It's backed up by extensive research provided by the selfsame folks who have accomplished their financial goals, including reams of statistics and some interesting interpretations (like buying a car &quot;by the pound&quot;).<br />  Unmentioned in most other reviews: The two authors have also provided an equation based on statistics gleaned from the PAWS.   The equation allows a reader to find out what side of the UAW/PAW paradigm they're on.<br />  Are these folks happy?  I'm not sure.  And who cares?  This book lays out a roadmap to financial success; it's not SUPPOSED to be a weighty Aristotlean tome on how we're supposed to live.  If you want principle-based living, read Steven Covey and the like.<br />  I'm getting this book for my brother for the Yule.  I just hope it helps him get hishead out of his arse financially, stop gambling on the riverboats, and halt economic aid to his ungrateful (and unworthy) kids. <br />  Another great gift suggestion: Send this to your friends and family members in Amway and other direct marketing &quot;businesses.&quot;  Ask them why no Amway distributors made the list of millionaires!<br />
006017322X|5.0|A great book with all its philosphical questions... What makes it a very good book is its being told from the eyes of an innocent child.
067158037X|5.0|I purchased the audio version of this book as I'm so pressed for time to read text. I found myself transported from start to finish to Mr. McCourt's world and family life. As others have said I find it difficult to believe that there is no bitterness or hatred in his words or voice. But there are scars. On another level the book took me back to my own childhood. Although I'm not Irish the stifling grip and hypocrisy of the Church rings true for me. The attitude of Church officials toward Frank's family and their rejection of him when he applied to be an altar boy are stinging. After ten years of their educational system and twenty years at their weekly services I'd had enough. I haven't been back since and I assure you they'd have no problem judging someone like me. It was refreshing to hear Frank's voice with all its humor and pathos. Judging from the other reviews I've read it has opened up a dialogue about what it means to be young and poor. To speak with so eloquent a voice lifts us all up.
0061092037|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  the character are well defined and very interesting.  A real page turner.
1563523302|5.0|I'm the Head of a University Academic Radiology Department, and have attended Harvard Business School Courses.

0451167716|5.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo is without a doubt...a classic in every sense of the word. At first glance, the story revolves around the Corleone crime Family. Yet, it is much more than this. It is a story of a family and its struggles to accept itself and others. And not only is this a great book, but check out the movie too!
0802713319|5.0|That some of the greatest minds of the last 350 years couldn't solve this problem should whet the appetite of anyone curious enough to ponder at the problem's apparent simplicity. Singh's layman background is a handy ally to piecing together the story behind the mystery without needing to understand the mathematics. It is the story about the proof's discovery, not the proof itself. An excellent read.
0446604844|4.0|BALDACCI DOES IT AGAIN, HE FOLLOWED UP ABSOLUTE POWER WITH ANOTHER EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.  I ONLY HOPE HE CAN KEEP IT UP AND NOT TURN INTO ANOTHER JOHN GRISHAM.  TOTAL CONTROL IS FAST PACED, VERY SAD AT TIMES AND PROVIDES SOME GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF EMAIL. IF YOU LIKED ABSOLUTE POWER, THIS IS A MUST READ.  THE STORY CAN GET A LITTLE UNBELIEVEABLE AND MAYBE A LITTLE PREDICTABLE, BUT WELL WORTH IT.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess wrote what is a very distubing and thoroughly modern tale in A Clockwork Orange, a book that bewilders in its complexity but is yet simple in its humanity. Burgess, like Joyce before him, creates his own language for his tale of these futuristic thugs in a socially apocalyptic England.  It is a book that sucks you into its world so well for the very reason that you must learn its language.  And Burgess, despite his often shocking vulgarities and violence, is writing what is essentially the central parable of the modern age.   It tries to answer the question that lies at the heart of modern society: how do you find your essential humanity in a society that has come to regard the soul as a mixture of brain chemicals?  Burgess is relentless in his desire to find something beautiful and enduring about the human struggle in the dense web of human technology, and little could be more appropriate when facing the absurdities of the modern age.  This is a difficult, disturbing tale but one that belongs among the greats of all Western literature.
0440217563|5.0|I have never read a book that kept me thinking about it even after I was finished with it. I have since started to read the series again but this time I'm going to read it slower so that I don't miss anything. I hope that DG writes more books like this.
0060171936|5.0|SOMEHOW THIS BOOK FOUND IT'S WAY INTO MY LIFE WHEN TIMES WERE BAD. IT SHOWED ME A WAY OF LOOKING AT LIFE AND A UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE MISS JUST BY THE TRAPPINGS OF OUR EXISTENCE. VERY INSIGHTFUL AND WELL WRITTEN.
0802130208|5.0|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; was given to me as a gift.  I was wary after reading the critical quotes on the cover proclaiming it &quot;the funniest book you'll ever read!&quot;  Yeah, right, I thought.  Feeling properly skeptical, I sat down to read.  And read, and read.  And then I started to laugh!      By the last chapter, I was both laughing and weeping, and overcome with wonder at the brilliance, the oh-so-carefully plotted genius, of Toole's tale and his colorful characters.  Never has critical opinion so UNDERSTATED the marvelous, entertaining quality of a work of fiction!  Yes, New Orleans (and the rest of the world) have changed greatly in the thirty-odd years since this book was written, but that will not hold the reader back from stepping into that vanished, eccentric, delicious New Orleans that Toole conjures up so effortlessly.  Igantius Reilly, his obstinately wacky anti-hero, well deserves a place among the truly unforgettable characters of Amercian Literature.  The true trajedy of this novel is only that Toole, overcome by rejection and despair, killed himself before he could further enrich us  with other creations as deeply satisfying and joyous as &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;!.
0385311400|5.0|I, not being one who reads lengthly books nor romances for that matter, fell in the depths of this series rather quickly. &quot;Outlander&quot; was introduced to me by a friend of mine whom use to roll her eyes and laugh whenever I mentioned lavendar oil, and I simply had to find out what this small thing about lavendar oil she had. Not knowing what to expect, I was skeptical, but that was soon put to ease. This series is does a wonderful job of exploring the trendils of Scotthish History, along with a bit of French, West Indies, and pre-revolutionary American History, with the tied in web of two lovers - James Fraser and Claire. Thrown together by time and war, they fall into the depths of love. Torn apart by blood and hate, and a unborn child, they battle their lives seperated by 200 years, once again back together in passion that could dispell even Muspell's fires, they struggle for their lives, living with the love and seperation of their daughter, and their guilt of things done during the 20 years apart. Finally to settle in America before the Revolotionary War, making new friendships with Natives, and bears and skulls (grin). And to be reunited with their lost daughter Brianna. (whom also has a heated romance with a Roger MacKenzie, that is quite interesting in itself). Through a few family feuds (mostly between Brianna and stubborn Jamie) the series ends leaving you longing for more, and with a dreamy smile upon your face. I will not say the series is flawless, because it's not, but I truely do recomend this series to anyone who wants to escape reality and forget everyones' existance, even for only a few hours at a time.
0679745203|1.0|I didn't get this book, but I tried to keep reading.  I am an avid reader, but I finally had to quit wasting my time.  I couldn't identify with any of the characters (thank God).  I can't recommend this book to anyone.

0446310786|5.0|A wonderfully captivating book. The characters are vivid and the lessons memorable. One of the all time best. I was amazed by how closely the movie by the same name follows the book.
0345404475|5.0|Sometimes one wonders why some people even bother to read.  If you are a fan of the movie Blade Runner, and you are a little disapointed by this book, then shame on you.  You shouldn't be reading  books in the first place then!  Rarely can movies capture all the themes and ideas of a book, and rarely can books capture the artistic cinematography of film.  The two media are separate.  Treat them as such. <br /> What Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? are about is the routine of police bounty hunter Rick Deckard.  His job is to hunt down and &quot;retire&quot; fugitive androids.  But what the movie only scratched the surface of is WHY those androids are fugitives.  Fans of the character of Data from Star Trek, or of the computer Mike from Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress will find the familiar theme of what it is that defines the difference between artificial intelligence and artificial life. <br /> This is the realization that Deckard comes to and must deal with:  these androids are not mere machines with off-switches, they are living creatures, aware of their own existence and their own mortality.  In the post-nuclear holocaust world that Deckard exists in, humans define life  by their ability to feel empathy.  Empathy for the lives of each other, empathy for the lives of the remaining animal species of earth decimated  by fallout, or empathy for artificial life.  Eventually, Deckard questions his own ability to feel empathy, and therefore, his own humanity.  For if being alive is about feeling empathy, then how can he truly be alive without feeling empathy for the living machines whose job it is for him to kill. <br /> In the film version, Rutger Hauer's performance as one of the androids briefly captured the theme of the book, but it was never really explored and was instead sacrificed for artistic license.  If you were intrigued by special effects, skip this book and rent Terminator 2.  If you were intrigued by the question of artificialintelligence and artificial  life, then you may want to ask if androids really DO dream of electric sheep.
0440213525|4.0|The Client is about an eleven-year old child running away from the mob. Mark(the child)together with his younger brother had witnessed a suicide and came to know about the location of the dead senator. The younger brother fell into a coma due to shock and so left Mark alone to do the lying and the running both from the FBI and th mob. Mark read a poster in the hospital advertising a lawyer dealing in accidents and decide to hire himself a lawyer. He sneaks out of the hospital and goes to the building where the lawyer's office is.(which is coincidentally near to the hospital) The secretary asks him whether he had an accident and he tries to explain his situation but in the end gives up. He goes to another lawyer's office. The secretary who is a male humoured him this time and so let him see the lawyer who is a lady.(Funny when you think about it, the secretary is male while the lawyer is female) The lady lawyer listens to Mark's case for less than 30 minutes and PRESTO!! Mark hires a lawyer for about a dollar.(I think) Next, the mob threatens him in the lift, burns down his house and tries to move the senator's body while Mark has to go to court, play hide-and-seek with the mob and FBI, hide in the mortuary in the hospital, escape from 'jail', cry a lot and make important decisions that could cost him his life. Overall, I find the Client quite a readable book that can keep you awake through the night but the plot can get a bit ridiculous and too coincidental and times.
0964385619|5.0|Next to religion, the success of our children and our family's financial safety are our most important concerns.  I lost my job 13 years ago, my brother-in-law has lost his twice in the last decade, and our son-in-law lost his when his workplace burned down.  Each of these events caused a financial crisis for us, a crisis because, in part, we did not know and do what this book teaches.<br /> The major points of this book are presented in diagrams and this was critical to us, because, like most people, much of our family can't make sense of numbers and time.  Just like the author, we learned from our educated parents what to NOT do financially, because what we learned was what worked in the 1950's and 1960's.  It doesn't work now and we needed to relearn, beginning with the basics found in this book.<br /> Highly recommended for all families and young adults.
0684874350|5.0|Well, I must say that i never expected to read a memoir.  I'm glad that i read this one.  I can commiserate with the fear of priests and teachers and parents and tauntings from my peers, the fear of the days to come.  I've been there.  I think we all have.  It discourages me that so many people think that Mr. McCourt should be seeking mental care.  I don't think he should be.  I'm glad he's of the old breed that can remember his life and laugh about it.  We all should be able to do that.  It gives me hope that in the end we'll all be able to look back on this and laugh.  Better yet to be able to tell others and make them laugh too.  It's a tragic story but so what we all have tragic stories which I think McCourt understands and this is why he never lets us pity him.  I certainly don't pity him.  I'm sorry he never got to know his sister or his two brothers, the twins.  But oh well.  He'll live and he doesn't make me feel that I should go down on my two knees and beg his forgiveness for him growing up the way he did.  I think McCourt wrote most of this book laughing his ass off.  I would have.  I don't feel bad for him.  I'm envious.  I've never had an apple freshly plucked from the tree and I doubt I'll ever have milk straight from the cow.  McCourt is the sterotypical Irishman.  He's got troubles but he still manages to laugh about it and so do I and so should we all.<BR><BR> McCourt got over it and I think perhaps his detractors ought to as well.
B000002OK3|5.0|&quot;Looken for some happieness, but there is only lonilyness to be found&quot; that is one of the lyrics to a song on the greatest soundtracks in history.  This soundtrack is like no other.  It contains some of the greatest hit ever such as Little Green Bag, Stuck in the Middle with You, Coconut, and I Gotcha.  Not to mention a lot of lyrics from a great comedian, but from the movie itself.  If you have seen the movie then the soundtrack will no doubt blow you away.  If you haven't seen the movie it will still blow you away you just won't be able to remember what excellent scenes occured when the song played in the movie.  So all I have left to say is the lyrics were wrong, happiness can be found right here on this CD.     END
0679720200|5.0|Well, let's just say it, this book made me shiver. Camus' cold look at society, religion, ethics, and indeed all of humanity is very artfully done. I'm no existentialist, but this book is something everyone ought to read. Camus combines art with content, mirroring the valuelessness and cool indifference of Meursalt with crisp, unornamental writing. I love the novel for its quick insight, its graceful art, and its truthfulness. I even love it for the surprising views presented. If anyone is ever going to prove that life is meaningless, that values are useless, and that there is no objective truth (which no one ever will), Camus has done it.
0345350499|5.0|I was stunned at how much I loved this book the first time I read it.  People would see me with the book and comment upon what great a read it was.  The twist of telling the Arthurian story from the female perspective makes for great discussion.  The love of the goddess and mother earth is so compelling that I now question the history we were taught.  The lineage being passed down through the mother makes too much sense (because who really knows who the father is??).  It will always be one of my favorite books.

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a great book.  It is about 2 men named Lennie and George.  Lennie is somewhat retarded and very big.  He touches a girl's dress in the city of Weed and has to run away with George.  They go to a farm where they find Candy, Slim, Curley, Curley's Wife, Crooks and Carlson.  Candy is an old lonely man who's only real friend is his dog. Carlson hates his dog so much that he shoots it.  Lennie wants something soft to pet, so Slim gives him a dog.  Lennie gets mad with the dog one day, hits it, and accidently kills it.  This forshadows the killing of Curley's Wife.  Curley's Wife was talking to Lennie in the barn one day, and let Lennie pet her hair.  Lennie starts hurting her, and then breaks her neck by accident and kills her.  He doesn't know his own strength.  Lennie runs to the brush, where the saddest part in the novel happens.  George, out of love, shoots Lennie.  He tells Lennie the dream for a better life before he shoots him.                           This was one of the best books I have ever read.
0553284347|5.0|This is an incredibly excellent book for those who are either adult children of Toxic parents or those who may have a relationship with an adult child of Toxic parents.  I am  a member of the second group I mentioned. Although I did not have toxic parents myself, I do deal with the hurt and the anger and the grief through a man I love very much. This book has given me some hope for his recovery and for our relationship. The next step is having him read this book and take the steps to realize his reality and to break the cycle before they get out of hand.
0679416781|5.0|There are three books I keep by my bed to dip into on occasion before going to sleep: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov, and The English Patient by Ondaatje. I can read segments of these again and again because with each reading I find something new at an even deeper level. The movie version of the English patient, while visually evocative, was untimately unsatisfying because it took the easy way out and focused on only one of the many emotional relationships explored in the book. And if I could read the original Russian I am sure that I would find the same extraordinary use of language in War and Peace and the Master and Margarita that I find in The English Patient, which is masterpiece of evocative prose - indeed rivaling the best of poetry. This book is not for everyone. You need to work at reading it, savor it, return to it often, suspend the need for instant understanding, and be willing to think.
0452273331|5.0|The Fountainhead is not so much a book as a life experience.  For all the times you were punished or criticized for following your own individual values, this book is your redemption.  If you still cling to innocent, idealistic values, you will love Howard Roark and be grateful for his existence.  If, however, you have given in and compromised your values to try to succeed on society's or others' terms, it is too late and you  will probably only resent Howard Roark for representing what you could have been.  For me this book has been the support I needed in tough times, and also the inspiration to seek out the best self that I could be.  Take a chance and read it;  you'll know immediately whether this book is the best or worst thing you've ever read
0385472951|3.0|I actually enjoyed this story, until I finished it and really thought about it. Grisham is such a master of imagining ways to manipulate our flawed legal system - the media plays, wire transfers of funds, jetting around the world, exploiting the press - it's easy to get caught up in rooting for his protagonists. But Patrick Lanigan was less than any of the others. Patrick abandons the 2-yr-old little girl who grows up knowing him as daddy, just because he finds out that he wasn't the sperm donor. Not only is it hard for me to feel sympathy for this man - I actually am repulsed. Also, the money that was stolen (hypothetically) belonged to the American taxpayer, and Lanigan finds a way to screw us royally. He could have turned in the crooks and set things right. The way Grisham carefully constructed the torture scene to try to make us feel sympathy for this schmuck really makes me sick. Hey, you steal from the mob, you're taking your chances. Anybody knows that. Also, was there any reader in the entire world who thought Lanigan really murdered someone to set up his disappearance? It was too obvious to hold the slightest shred of suspense. Grisham's writing talent and ability to detail a plot commands my respect, however the immoral statements he makes in The Partner reveals to me that his character is far less than desirable.
0812550706|5.0|If you browse through all readers commentary, you will find that 9 out of 10 will give this book a score of 9/10. For the rest 10% who disliked this book, I can only say &quot;Allright, we agree to disagree about this book rating. But for this case, I said that following the majority is not a bad idea&quot;. My personal opinions is, this is a great book of sci-fi , a masterpiece of Mr. Card, and I believe that it will become classic (like &quot;Dunes&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, for instance).

But the whole time, I kept asking why? Contrived and ridiculously implausible plot. Characters so thin they seem to lack substance entirely.

1884822312|5.0|This hardback phonebook-sized tome is worth every penny Amazon charges for it. Over 5000 diagrams give the reader ample opportunity to become adroit at determining the best relationships among the pieces. For example, there is a large section of mate-in-twos. In many of the board settings of that section, the reader could easily mate in multiple moves, but the requirement to mate in two forces one to develop a strong sense of how the pieces work, separately and together. And in many real games, one has but a brief window of opportunity to put the pieces to work.  It is surprisingly easy to play chess over the Internet.
0393038912|5.0|Jared Diamond's work may be the most important contribution to the understanding of human history since Rousseau's DISCOURSE OF THE ORIGIN OF INEQUALITY (1755) forced philosophers to question the assumption that civilization was &quot;naturally&quot; superior to pre-literate (&quot;savage&quot;) society.  Diamond has had the courage to raise the essential questions about the psychic unity of our species, the origins of political institutions, and the shape of modern history.  In so doing, his analysis reflects the explosion of knowledge in evolutionary biology over the last decade while integrating research cutting across many fields in the social sciences and humanities. Although some specialists have quibbled about details (professors are territorial animals), Diamond's basic question -- why did Europe conquer the New World, Africa and Asia -- cannot be addressed without something like his broad view.  Given the absurd stereotype of biology as genetic determinism, it is particularly fascinating to see how biogeography takes on an essential role in the explanation of cultural differences and historical sequences.  No longer can serious analyses of Western global hegemony ignore the argument that it is due to such factors as the timing of hominid settlement in various continents, their orientation and scale, and the diversity of their fauna and fauna suited for domestication. Diamond's complex analysis of the origins (and frequent collapse) of political institutions challenges the simplistic formulas that dominate most social science today.  If you are seriously interested in understanding human nature, history and politics, this book is not to be missed. Despite all the publicity it has received, few of my colleagues seem to have read -- or even know about -- Diamond's important and thought-provoking book.  If you are seriously interested in understanding human nature, history and politics, GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL is not to be missed.      Roger D.

0517122707|5.0|This book was recommended as a &quot;good read.&quot;  Initially it seemed fatuous (pun intended) but after 20 pages I could not put it down.  It shows a real, seamy side of New Orleans and real characters: the fat, spoiled, 30 year old Mama's boy, educated way beyond his common sense (if he had any).  Yet his actions, philosophy, and intense emotional interaction with those around him ring true.  A totally unique white whale, trying to swim upstream, but afraid to leave New Orleans.  The Black vagrant is much more, and 3-dimensional, as are all others in the book.
067942850X|5.0|Christopher McCandless's last journal entry before dying of starvation in the Alaska bush was simply the words &quot;Beautiful Blueberries&quot;.  Over the previous two years he bought a secondhand canoe on impulse and paddled to Mexico, lived on the streets of Los Angeles with bums, camped in the Arizona dessert with hippies, tramped through almost every western state occasionally holding odd jobs, and lived completely off the land in the Alaskan backcountry. McCandless's epic journey separated him from his parents and peers, a world of security and material excess, and a world &quot;in which he felt grievously cut off from the raw throb of existence&quot;.  It was a  journey which would have been a complete waste if it weren't for Jon Krakauer's book entitled Into the Wild.<br />   A lot of people believe that McCandless was an idiot.  He was &quot;simply one more dreamy half-caulked greenhorn who went into the country expecting to find answers to all his problems and instead found only mosquitoes and a lonely death&quot;.  Some people blamed Krakauer, in the magazine article which preceded the book, for glorifying &quot;a foolish, pointless death&quot;.  But the beauty of Krakauer's writing is that he doesn't glorify Chris McCandless's life or even try to hide his personal weaknesses.  What comes through instead is a vivid portrait of McCandless's journeys and an examination of why people are attracted to high risk activities.<br />   Krakauer begins the book with Chris McCandless hiking into the Alaskan wilderness to his ensuing death.  He does not return to this scene until the next to last chapter, effectively forcing the reader to see McCandless as more than an unprepared misfit who deserved to die because of the risks he took.  We learn of his adventures tramping around the continent, discern how McCandless differs from people whom he had been favorably compared to in the outdoors community, learn of his family and upbringing, and we are told of a similar adventure in Alaska which almost claimed the authors life.  Only then are we returned to the morbid Alaskan scene and the controversies surrounding McCandless's death.  Krakauer succeeds in writing a powerful book because we become attached to McCandless's dream and sympathize to a greater degree with his desire to undertake what he labeled as the ultimate challenge.<br />   It is also the untraditional aspects of the book, in which he goes about examining Chris McCandless through his own life, through others who have a similar desire for adventure, and through an examination of the novels he read, which turns the book into something greater than a story of Chris McCandless.  Into the Wild is not a fluff story about a misdirected youth; it has themes to which anyone who has ever dreamed of undertaking their own adventure,  however small, can relate and gain insight.<br />    Overall Krakauer believes Chris McCandless wasn't that different from anyone else who liked adventure.  Throughout the book there is an underlying battle against McCandless's critics by trying to justify the journey.  Krakauer confesses that after writing a magazine article on McCandless he remained &quot;haunted by the particulars of the boy's starvation and by vague, unsettling parallels between events in his life and those in my own.&quot;  Unwilling to let McCandless go, Krakauer spent more than a year retracing the convoluted path that led to his death in the Alaska bush, chasing down the details &quot;with an interest that bordered on obsession&quot; until he finished writing the book.  In this fierce passion, Krakauer is not only telling of McCandless's life but his own, and in the process trying to make a world of critics understand why he, McCandless, and countless others are drawn to a life of potentially suicidal adventure.  This passion draws the reader in, spins them around and spits them back out into the world with a different perception of life.  This passion makes Into the Wild anamazing book.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather was by far the best book I have ever read. Often I find myself having trouble focusing on a book, but with The Godfather I had no trouble. I couldn't put it down. It goes into such detail with every scene, especially about the meeting between all the heads of the families. I had seen the movie before reading the book and I thought it would be impossible to better the movie but it did. It was interesting to learn about the characters and the situations they were in. I loved the additional detail in the book. One example of this detail is when they explain how Michael returned from Sicily because of Ttaglia's son. They hardly touched this subject in the movie. Also, in the movie there were large time gaps, unlike in the book.  Anyone interested in the mafia or organized crime would love this book. I have only read the book once, but I plan to read it again. No disrespect to the movie, it is my favorite movie too. This is a must read.
0312853238|5.0|I read this book nearly 5 years ago and have still found it one of the most classic sci-fi ever written.  I guess to really appreciate the book, instead of the cheap thrills as many sci-fi now are, one has to look a bit beyond the surface.  The part, to me which I found the most profound was not the sci-fi atmosphere and &quot;aliens&quot; but rather the portrayal of a young boy named Ender, becoming what he hated the most.  This story is not just a tale of a genius boy fighting aliens, but is a story that captivates what many people today will or have experienced; that sometimes what we hate the most, we sometimes become.  Well... anything more would spoil it.<br />      If there is one book in Sci-Fi to read try this one, I'm sure you won't be disappointed and hey, it's only a couple bucks (well... unless you're in a middle school reading this as a requirement, what a bummer... =p )
0425152251|5.0|I think Sophie's World is a book, not only to be read and reread, as most people say, but also to be of thought in the heart. The character of Sophie, although very heart warming  is a little too naive. But I enjoyed the book throughly and  in his simple words, the author presented this book for more than adults to read. Elegant and noble, I really think that this book also can be to people like me, although we're just mere twelve year olds!
0679735909|5.0|Despite slow going in the first 50 pages, this book is deserving of the reader's time and tenacity.  An intricate and lovely duo of stories, both reflective of and on their periods.

0671721720|4.0|Well, if Honor keeps going through ships at this rate, she'll be a large chunk of the Manticoran Navy's expenses.  Not like that would stop anyone involved from showering her with very well deserved titles and awards.  This books sees Honor going to Grayson, a planet settled by a bunch of Old Earth Christian fundamentalists, who want to live &quot;as God intended&quot;. Needless to say, they've managed to get way behind in technology. They've also managed to develop a splinter group that settled another planet in their system called Masada.  The Masadans want to destroy the &quot;Apostate&quot; any way they can, and have enlisted the Havenites to help them do it.  Once again, we get to see Honor against enormous odds, with a good chance that she, and her ship, won't make it to the last page. I won't give away the ending, but I'll say this. Weber managed to push a lot of the right buttons with this woman regarding the attitudes of the Masadans and the Graysons, as well as keep me glued to the final battle till I finished it.  I'm looking forward to The Short Victorious War.
0671004107|2.0|This book is not a very good one.  Carl Sagan does a great job in putting science into science fiction, but leads you up to a terrible climax.  If this was the only thing wrong with it then I would have given this book a higher rating, but Sagan enraged me by making all religious people out to be freaks and slack-jawwed yockles.  This really insulted me.  I feel Mr. Sagan ruined a perfectly boring book by his attacks at religion.  If this book was written when THE ORIGINS  OF SPECIS came out the Christians would have attacked CONTACT!!

It appeales to the sci-fi reader, the pioneer book reader, the fantasy reader, and a whole slew of other readers. IF you like stories about the human  condidion, this is the book and series for you!!!
0060925000|5.0|The western reader must refrain from hope habituated by the western novel, and enjoy Mr. Seth's wonderful character descriptions and use of history. This book holds excellent writing and knowledge of the diverse cultures and rituals of India, with well-drawn characters recognisable anywhere, in any milieu. It weakens in the last chapters, as it can understandably become too much for any author to convey the dread weight of India as she is.
0679457313|4.0|An odd tale, but told with a style all it's own. Somewhat reminiscent of Rushdie and with a descriptive power equal to Steinbeck. Definitely not Hollywood film material (I hope they don't attempt it). If this author plans a second book it had better be good or it will be bound to dissapoint.
067158037X|5.0|When I put the book down as I reluctantly did from time to time to continue with the duties of life, I felt like I had to brush the fleas off of me, wash the rags I most certainly had on and look for food. The book was so engrossing that to put it down, was to wake from a deep sleep.

Reading it prompted me to start my own evil clown page, and it is amazing how many letters I receive from people that were seriously traumatized by this book.  The way that King switches back and forth between past and present is brilliant.  You also feel like you know all of the characters personally after only a few chapters.  This is the rare book that I can read over and over and still get freaked out over.<br />
0684874350|4.0|The writing attracted me.  A common thread of inventive, simple prose runs throughout the book giving art to an interesting story.  Ferrol Sams's fiction  is somewhat like this.   I got a little tired of the &quot;self&quot; focus, and found myself more interested in what happened to Michael and Angela, and even the absent father after Frank left.  Can a memoir be selfish?
0140186409|5.0|This is a book that cannot be read quickly.  The slow pace of it gives the reader more of an opportunity to fully appreciate the greatness of Steinbeck's talents.  This is a story of how people adapt to poverty and despair by increasing the concept of &quot;family&quot; to encompass all of those suffering the same conditions.  Being united against &quot;them&quot; (the banks, the landowners) is the only way to survive.  This is shown on the group level by the self-governing government camp and on the personal level by Rose of Sharon's act of kindness to a starving man. Steinbeck does a masterful job of developing the Joad family - from Ma Joad's increasing strength to Tom's gradual enlightenment. Steinbeck was, indeed, a genius.
0684874350|5.0|My Irish relatives are tossing in their graves, wishing they could add their own hilarious comments to Frank's sad tale.  It shouldn't be possible to find humor in such a tragic childhood, but my husband and I both laughed steadily throughout this innocent account of a family sentenced to poverty by their father's disease.  McCourt perfectly captures the Irish point-of-view, finding honor and love in unlikely places while managing to overlook  obvious indications that much is terribly wrong.
0679457313|5.0|'The God of Small Things' is a wonderfully rich and innovative novel.  I am an artist who idolizes James Joyce, and this novel is the first one I have encountered which indicates an understanding of his techniques and power. Arundhati Roy's language is beautiful- she is a poet in novelist's costume- covered with mirrors!  She has absorbed all of the lessons of the great writers and has transformed reality into something miraculous and strange- as seen through the eyes of a child!  I also have spent nearly two years travelling, teaching, and taking photographs throughout India, and let me tell you, this lady nails India- with all of it's visual exoticism, philosophical complexity, and moral hypocrisy.  I tend to believe that her Indian detractors are feeling the heat because she has come and and exposed what is obvious to anyone who knows anything about India- the class and caste wars, the abuse of women, the tyrranny of tradition, etc.  A great book, by which other writers will be judged!
0812550706|5.0|<br /> <br /> Showing great promise, Ender begins his education in warfare at an early age, and struggles through an endless barrage of 'games' until, years later, he is ready for his final test. <br /> Orson Scott Card's writing shows his great ability at characterization.  You are welded to the character throughout the book.  When Ender suffers a drawback, you feel the sting.  When he triumphs, you feel the glory! <br /> A great read.
0679457313|5.0|'The god of small things' is a fearless offering by a writer who has tremendous instincts. Every  word is insightful, funny and carries the weight of an entire society's conditioning. All this with amazing lightness and complete effortlessness.<br /> Roy's language is sticky yet effervescent. She is one of those authors who probably didn't need to learn the rules in order to break them.<br /> Whatever she does, and however she does it, I want more.

0553103547|5.0|Many years have passed since a book surprised me so much as this one... It appears to be ordinary heroic fantasy, but soon it develops a lot of interesting characters, each one with their own personality, and allways coherent. But the best thing in the book is that, although the characters and plots are absolutely logical given the personalities involved, each chapter (and there are many) gives an absolutely new twist to the plot. That is something very difficult to acomplish without giving up with logic an coherency... But this book is from the author of &quot;Fevre dream&quot;, and it should be spected. Only that G. R. R. Martin is allways a good surprise.
0679457313|5.0|My reading of this book was tainted with all the hoo-haa about its excellency and its booker-prizy feel about it  combined with my watch for it to reach its expectations..Being a Mar Thomite , it was nice to  read names of places and the  numerous Malayalam words which are so familiar and which we use at home (not the bad ones ) . I truly enjoyed her style of writing (from a child's and an adults viewpoint) - viable, die-able age . The story jumps from past to present which is an unusual style that keeps the story strangely flowing, even in the jumps. I love the characters created ( both endearing and not) as they are extremely real (as Roy writes from personal experience ) and extremely believable. I enjoyed the book thoroughly and feel extremely proud that an indian, a keralite brought forth such art from her own homeland in the form of A God of Small Things
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt's reading of his book Angela's Ashes has been one of the best listening experiences I have had in recent years.  I laughed, I cried, I felt ill; all while I was driving from part of the city to another.  Poverty as seen through the eyes of a child is heartbreaking, but humorous as well.   Highly recommend the unabridged version as every minute is fascinating as well as entertaining.
0316548189|5.0|A mezmerizing view of a man who transcends his time and his place in history. He has the perpective of both a  novelist, with a rich, vibrant sense of detail, and a great moral philospher. His humor, humility, and love of humanity come across on literally every page.   The most striking aspect of the book is Mandela's lack of bitterness toward his jailers and love of South Africa as a whole. He spares no one, including himself. Yet he also gives everyone their just due without settling scores, as is too often the case with political memoirs.  I unreservedly recommend this book as I honor the man.
0553278398|5.0|This fantastic piece of work by late Grand Master Asimov, is a &quot;prequel&quot; (now that the word is fashionable) to the Foundation Trilogy. It is about the youth of Hari Seldon, the mathematician that developed the science of Psycohistory to predict the future.<br />  In this book we can see the galactic capital world of Trantor during the reign of emperor Cleon I. As usual, Asimov uses the various situations in the novel to analize contemporary or historical sociological topics, such as rural-urban migration, religious beliefs and economic influences in culture.<br />  The climatic ending of this novel, which is the cornerstone of the 3 great sagas of Asimov (Robots, Empire and Foundation novels) sets Hari Seldon on his way to develop the future of the galaxy and his beloved Foundation project.<br />

0887307280|5.0|This book emphasized concepts I thought about and even started before, but had never seen articulated like this. Gerber's style really pulls you into the message and makes E-myth an interesting and personal read. I finished it in 2 sessions - I couldn't put it down! The book really made me see my business in a different light and will change the way I operate from here on out.  A previous reviewer mentioned that systems stifle creativity. NOT TRUE. As a matter of fact, systems are quite liberating. I run a creative business and systems allow us spend more time doing our jobs (being creative) and less time figuring out HOW do our jobs.  At any rate, E-myth is the single most valuable piece of business literature I've ever read. Period.
0060976624|5.0|Thank You for Smoking should be banned from public places since the amount of laughter it engenders is hazardous to public sanity.  I was reading the book on the subway when I came to tobacco flackman Naylor's Nuremburg &quot;paying ze mortgage&quot; defense. Given my rather audible reaction, I was lucky not to have been thrown off the train.  But if laughter is the best medicine, this sharp satire should be required reading for all smokers.
0553103547|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book!  Martin creates a fully believable world with well-crafted,empathetic characters.  The writing style is an interesting change from most other books in that every chapter is told from the perspective of a certain character.  Through this, Martin can present many views of pertinent situations.  In all, the book flows well and tells and intriguing tale.  My only complaint is that I fell in love with two or three characters, and I didn't get to hear from them enough.  It's always a joy when one finds a book that one would like more of, instead of less.

If you think Belgarath's a god, and can't handle the tarnishment of his character, you obviously missed what Polgara's been hinting at with a sledgehammer all these years.  This is a book for people who love Belgarath's world for what it is:  a rich tapestry of the ages, interwoven with true family values, and incredible character development and interaction.  The Eddings' Belgarath succeeds where Tolkein's Silmarilion failed:  it fills in the wonderful backdrop of the earlier books without becoming a dull academic paper.  And as the end makes obvious , one man can't tell the whole story, even if he's 7000 years old.  There's Polgara's story as well, and (we hope) the stories of Poledra the Wolf, and that wonderfully cantankerous Beldin the Hunchback.
0316779989|3.0|I've seen  this book described as delightful, acerbic, sardonic, charming.  It isn't humorous at all, instead it is a heavyhanded bitter collection of short stories by someone who apparently doesn't like the human race very much.
0812550706|1.0|I guess there's no accounting for taste, but why does anyone like this book? The idea of a 6 year-old military genius is absurd. And if there was one, the idea that the people of power would put a child in command of anything is even more absurd.  Does Card know any human beings? Can't tell from reading his book.  As for the storyline, it's trite and extremely predictible. The subplot about the boy and girl who take over the world via USENET is even more unbelievable than the main plot. (Doesn't Card realize that the people who run things don't have time to read USENET and couldn't care less what is said there?)  I can't think of a more naive book. If you know nothing about military matters, human nature, and the nature of power, this book might appeal. But only if you also have no taste in writing.  To those who like this book and are over 14 years old I can only say: read more!! I suggest something like Dune for a story with a more realistic picture of the complexies of human nature. Or some Mark Twain to get an idea of the difference between clear writing and good writing.
044022165X|4.0|I'll never get tired of this theme!  Unfortunately, Grisham takes on two entirely separate plots in The Rainmaker and never makes them matter to each other.  Romance with an abused wife deserved an entire book to itself, or else a clever way to relate it to the main plot--which was terrific as usual.  Wet-behind-the-ears kid lawyer brings down money-grubbing slime and its hired guns.  What's not to like?  :^)
0316743003|5.0|This book rocks!  I could hardly put it down.  With great development anecdotes, it gave this Gen-Ex Engineer insight into how great government contracting once was (at least somewhere).  The coolest parts are the pilots's views on cruising across the world in a Blazing SR-71 Blackbird.  Awesome!!
6304032579|5.0|This is the best 007 movie ever.  It has a lot of cool things like trains exploding, Tanks, Helicopters, and of course all the women James Bond wins.  Also, due to new technology the scenes are so much better.     END
0671004107|4.0|This work is commendable, considering it was Sagan's first fictional effort (although pundits would argue Sagan science writings contained an abundance of fiction).  The plot is believable, the characters are alive, and the science-oriented references give the story some added depth - especially for those who have some previous science knowledge.  Religious issues are confronted by Sagan with great fervor, who isn't apprehensive about expressing his opinions.  All in all, a solid science-fiction novel.  This is one case, however, where the movie tops the book.
0684800713|4.0|Though not as compelling as &quot;for whom the bell tolls&quot; or &quot;A farewell to arms&quot; and not as well planed as &quot;across the river and into the trees,&quot; this book represents a good begining point for understanding one of the great literary minds of the twentieth century.  As Hemingway explores both what humans have lost (after the great war)and what they seek to gain.  A poignant story that paints the shape of life as old Ernest envisions it.  Not bad for one of his very first works.
0465068359|5.0|Nanking is the capital of my home province. I have been told what terrible things Japan Army did before since I was very young. I can't forget the shock while I visited the museum in Nanking about the holocaust. I feel very angry that Japan government does not let their people know this terrible history. Who can guanrantee that this terrible thing will never happen again if we do not use this history mirror to warn us?  I am very happy for the publishing of this book. I will buy two copies, one for my Japanese friend, another for myself. I hope there will be a Japanese version so that more Japanese people can read this.

It is gruesome,terrifying and lovable all at once.The characterization is great - I can see all of them in my mind's eye.It's a powerful book if there ever was one - I never wanted to put it down and go to sleep! It's a book I would recommend everybody to read.
0684874350|5.0|FRANK McCOURT'S STORY IS THE KIND THAT HAD TO BE TOLD AND I - ALONG WITH MANY OTHER READERS - AM VERY THANKFUL THAT HE CHOSE TO DO SO.  FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS ELOQUENTLY DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE I FOUND MYSELF ENTHRALLED.  AS I READ ON ABOUT FRANK AND HIS POVERTY STRICKEN FAMILY I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS BOY WOULD EVER FIND HIS WAY THROUGH IT ALL, THAT HE WOULD EVER SEE MANHOOD.  THROUGH EACH PAGE I FOUND MYSELF TRANSPORTED TO A LIFE OF HARDSHIP IN NEW YORK TO UNSPEAKABLE SHAME, CRUELTY AND ENORMOUS SUFFERING IN THE SLUMS OF IRELAND.  I TRULY FELT AS THOUGH I WAS THERE WITH HIM.  SEEING IT, HEARING IT, TASTING IT, SMELLING IT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - FEELING IT.  MR. McCOURT'S WONDERFULLY DESCRIPTIVE WRITING HELD ME IN RAPT ATTENTION THROUGHOUT.  AS DIFFICULT AS IT WAS TO READ AT TIMES, I ALSO FOUND THAT I DID NOT WANT THE BOOK TO END.  WHAT A JOURNEY!  WHENEVER I FOUND MYSELF WITH TEARS WELLING IN MY EYES, THE VERY NEXT SENTENCE WOULD HAVE ME BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING, MR. McCOURT STILL FOUND THE HILARITY JUST WHEN HE NEEDED IT MOST.  AT THE END OF THE BOOK, WITH MR. McCOURT STANDING ON THE BOW OF THE SHIP WHICH FINALLY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO AMERICA AT THE AGE OF 19 I FOUND MYSELF WANTING TO BE THERE TOO.  TO BE THERE FOR HIM - AND COOK HIM UP A BIG PLATE OF MASHED POTATOES AND SOFTBOILED EGGS - BOTH SLATHERED IN SALT AND BUTTER - ALONG WITH ALL THE LEMONADE HE COULD EVER HOPE FOR!  MAY GOD BLESS YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR DAYS MR. McCOURT, AND FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE.  I NOW WAIT WITH RABID ANTICIPATION FOR THE CONTINUING CHAPTERS IN YOUR REMARKABLE STORY.
0385472951|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book and the background information. Especially how he weaves the information into an exciting story that covers many places. Had to keep reading it. However, I was disappointed in the ending. Felt it was rather weak compared to the rest of the book. Once everything has fallen into place I expected more - I was 'hanging' on each result until ..... the end.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is not like any other book written about Arthurian legand.  Not only is it told from a woman's point of view, but more importantly it tells a much more complex tale of the events that led to the downfall of King Arthur's reign.  This story is not just about the battles of the sword, although they are described with vivid detail, but it is about the battles of the spirit and souls of each character.  The struggle not only to find but to define their faith, and the battles they wage inside of themselves.  As you read, you will admire Morgaine's stregnth and understand how much she loves her family, and yet hates how they use her.  Her struggle coming to terms with herself and her existance, trying to find confidance in her self, and being tortured by Lancelet's off and on rejection and then love, will make you care for her character, almost as much as if you were Morgaine's own sister or brother.  Her trials and tribulations, as well as all of her joy and magic are described in such vivid detail that you will see it so truely in your mind's eye, as if you were watching it in movie.  When I was first assigned to read this book my freshmen year in highschool, I was closed to the idea of reading such a long book, and I was closed to the radical ideas presented therein.  But as I read, I became entranced; I felt the emotions of the characters, and I grew from the experience.  Reading this book will open your mind not only to new perspectives, but to new culture and religion.  To a new way of thinking, and a new way of being.  It is not an experience to be passed over.  Read the Mists of Avalon, and let yourself truely live.
0060925000|5.0|I'm reading &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; for the third time.In a few words,it's one of the best novels I've ever read and it is a masterpiece.Simple and magic!
0517591812|2.0|Although I appreciated all the history, the author's presentation was really dry.  Overall the story had possiblities, but Rutherford is no James Michener.  Rutherford does get an A for research though.
0684833395|4.0|Although I am not done reading this book, I find that it is one of the most confusing books that i have ever read.  The whole concept of Catch-22 was very unique and I loved every part that explained what a catch-22 was.  Many of the paragraphs in the book I had to over and over again and having to do that takes away from the pleasure of reading.
0671570439|5.0|Very interesting and instigating book, with a cientific base well done. The message in the PI number was great. The movie not even comment it.
0896760839|5.0|Not much in the way of a how-to book (I bought it long before I could make real use of it), but once you have an idea of how to sew late 16th-early 17th century clothing, it is an amazing resource.  There are just enough patterns of the shown clothing (along with pictures of period patterns) to give you an idea what patterns were used and how to create them.  Also, read the bibliography, much of it is not easily available, but it's usually wonderful.
0441172717|5.0|This book describes a young aristocrat`s rise to prophethood. This book has everything:- a medieval feudal society with an emperor in nominal control(reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire), a desert society based on early Islam and a heavy emphasis on character, religious fervour and drug abuse. The references to early Islam are rather blatant.It is clear the author drew on the real-life Ishmaeli Order of Assassins in 13th century Persia, for his description of the secret societies of the Bene Gesserit;Tleilaxu et al. The author also appears to be a neo-luddite(he is clearly antagonistic to the Ixians(who produce machines).But what I admire most about the author is his insertion of quotations at the beginning of each chapter. This creates a feeling of history behind his novel, which is something I have rarely seen in other science fiction novels which are too one-dimensional. One exception to this is the Moon-Moth by Jack Vance, a short story that I would highly recommend to any self-respecting science-fiction reader.
0451191153|5.0|...as evidenced by the extreme polarization of reviews, if nothing else. I think it is Rand's best book. It is not as simplistic and long as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (which is a momentuos book, too). I have just re-read it at age 30, and liked it even more than 4 years ago. Contrary to what some 1 and 2 reviewers say, it does have artistic merit, but to enjoy it you need to accept the fact that it's incurably Romantic. It's rather black and white (even so, not as nearly as much as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;) and her heroes are people as they should be, not as they are. If you can only accept a character that has the same weaknesses as you do and can't deal with an idealistic character with no weaknesses, you will not like this book. I got from it the feeling and appreciation of the incredible beauty man is capable of creating and living, and the uplift you get from watching a strong person laugh in the face of adversity and winning. It's unreal? So what? You see what's possible and worth trying to attain. I think the best way to describe &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a quote from the book itself: &quot;...a sense of joy. Not a placid joy. A difficult, demanding kind of joy. The kind that makes one feel as if it were an achievement to experience it. One looks and thinks: I'm a better person if I can feel that.&quot;
0440214041|3.0|Unlike what I had expected, the plot was very loose. Hard to believe that trained FBI agents could not catch Darby, President begs to drop the investigation, etc. Not upto the mark!
0393312836|5.0|This is a great book which unfortunately has too many odd words in it. Also, I believe that the film was better in that they got rid of the rather self-righteous 21st chapter in Burgesss book.But altogether a great read.
0465068359|5.0|When many Japanese politicians and, yes, ordinary people complain about the &quot;injustice&quot; imposed upon them during The World War II by the West, America in particular, we, Americans, should take a hard look at US-Japan relationship and re-think about our role and commitment in East Asia.  Unfortunately, unlike Germans, the Japanese are still keeping denying what they have done to the peoples of Asia, and American P.O.W.s during the war.  Iris Chang's book provides an excellent source of historical facts about the atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese military, which are unknown to most Americans.  When you are joyfully buying Toyotas, Hondas, Sonys, and Panasonics this holiday season, please buy THIS book and read it, you won't regret it.
0060926317|1.0|This is one scary book--and not just because it is so poorly written.  Indeed, it is scary because it is represented as a fictionalised true story.  The names have been changed either to protect the innocent or to bamboozle the gullable.  You choose after reading the rest of this review.  Morgan  presents &quot;Mutant [or is it mutilated?] Message&quot; as a factual novel, a novel based on her actual experiences in the Australian outback with an Australian tribe that calls itself &quot;The Real People.&quot;  However, the novel has little if any basis in fact: she gets just about everything wrong, from desert fauna and flora (one can't walk on spinifex grass), to the hierarchies and rituals of desert Aborigines (Aborigines don't have chiefs!), to the simple things like Australian currency (they don't use quarters in Australian phone booths) and geography.  Much of what Morgan tries to pass off as Australian and Aboriginal culture fits better with North American culture.   And speaking of consigning a people to cultural oblivion . . . .  Perhaps more scary than all this misrepresentation is the message itself.  Okay, I'll admit to being a closet New Ager.  I like the idea of universal oneness--as long as universal doesn't mean European or American.  And I'm cool with the New Age.  I even have a few Wyndham Hill albums.  But the idea that human beings should come to appreciate universal oneness is not the only message of this novel.  The really scary message is that universal oneness comes with a tacit acceptance of genocide--self-effacement at its most dangerous.  Morgan's point that the Aborigines of Australia--the &quot;Real People&quot; in particular--have agreed to disappear, have accepted the genocidal policies of successive Australian governments, is not only an untruth, but is an invitation to readers to acquiesce in such policies.  Hey, if these fictional Aborigines are enlightened enough to accept their oblivion--or is that oneness?--why should we protest?Just my $0.02.  Which is about all I would pay for this novel.
0684833395|5.0|The first chapter of Catch-22 will make you giggle, the second will make you laugh out loud, and Major Major will have you rolling on the ground.  The beauty  strikes about three-fourths of the way through the book, when you realizing you're not laughing anymore -  you're crying.<br /> Heller's black humor captures perfectly the insanity  of WWII.  Amidst piccaresque episodes, such as Yossarian attending a presentation stark naked, Heller threads a deeper and more long-lasting element.  His characters make you laugh, so you love them; he pulls the rug he has been weaving out from under your unsuspecting bottom when they start to die.<br /> Catch-22 will pull your heartstrings while it makes you smile; this cruel irony constitutes Heller's message: WAR IS HELL.
0451525884|5.0|Jane Austen's subtle wit and piquant characterizations are at their best in this, her most famous work.  Lizzy Bennett is the most delightful heroine of all time, and Darcy will spoil women for real men for all time.  The plot moves rapidly, the dialogue is clever, and each character is well fleshed-out without being overpowering.  Everybody gets what they deserve in the end, and there is not a loose end to be found. Brilliant.

1567407757|5.0|The 'message' is simple AND profound.  LOVE one another.  We've heard it in church, sociology class, from our parents.  But we never seem to heed the meaning of the words.  Morrie Schwartz says it again, and this time, maybe, we'll listen.  The book was an exceptional read.
0553476580|2.0|This is a nice little read and will be right up your street if you are a fan of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I was, however, put off by the shallow characters, in particular Fatima. While her lover is busy following his destiny of travel and adventure, her lot is to content herself with household chores on a desert oasis while awaiting his return. As we are repeatedly told, this is her fate as a desert woman and she is only too pleased to live a life in waiting. I don't find this inspirational in the least and I would not pass this book to my 10 year old niece even if it is within her reading ability. Nor would I be keen for any young boys to get a hold of this lest they come to the conclusion that it is the role of all young women to simply sit around for their white knights. Sure it's a cute story - but one that is trite and somewhat thoughtless.
6300181251|5.0|Psycho is probably the most &quot;cinematic&quot; and arguably the best of Alfred Hitchcock's American films.  Even today, thirty-seven years after its initial release, the film is still powerful, unsettling stuff.  It's distinctly different from Hitchcock's other works, dealing as it does with unpleasant, graphic murders among ordinary, even bland, characters.  The acting, especially from the often under-rated Janet Leigh and the subtle, incisive Anthony Perkins, is uniformly above grade.  And that shower scene -- even after repeated viewings, it retains its ability to unsettle and disturb the viewer!  Refreshingly free of the complicated visual &quot;tricks&quot; and plot twists of many of Hitchcock's other films, the rather straight-forward narrative draws us in until we're hooked, then pulls the rug out from under us in the best thriller fashion.  The carefully fleshed-out characters are perhaps equalled, in Hitchcock's ouevre, only by those in &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, another film set uncharacteristically among realistic middle-class people rather than the high-society and spy types that populate so many of Hitchcock's films. Hitchcock himself was reportedly suprised by the overwhelming success of a movie he viewed, originally, as an experiment -- an attempt to bring TV production techniques and talent to a low-budget (for Hitchcock) film.  Clearly, like many artists, he underestimated his own masterpiece.  See it!  And shiver!    END
0385486804|5.0|This book was most definitely one of my favorite reads, once you pick it up it is hard to put back down. Makes you want to throw away the bonds of society and live in a romantic world of man and nature. I am somewhat disheartened by the apparent misreading of the book by some people, I think McCandless' story is misunderstood by people who can't comprehend leaving our materialistic-industrial society for nothing but peace of mind. Three cheers for Krakauer who made us aware of this amazing story, also the author of the incredible &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; a story of the tradgedy of a climb up Mount Everest in 1996.

First, it was the sole reason reading become a serious occupation in my spare time (which kept me out of trouble in my adolescence); second, it's the only book I've read more than twice (I've read it 15 times since I was 14).  However, I did become depressed when I AM LEGEND was rumored to be out of print.  I'm ecstatic to learn that's not the case!  To those who have never read this book, you have only my pity.
0446310786|5.0|Though this book has been associated with many people's negative experiences in 9th grade english, this is still literature worth picking up.  If not that it is a great piece of american literature, then get it because it is one of the most banned books in america!
0671004611|4.0|Most of the book is well written but, I have a few questions.Some of the technological finds on the ship is technology from the 1980's . Like night vision ,cpu chips and lasers.Why would an advanced culture be stuck in that time frame?  But most of the other finds make sense.Like thought controll for the ship , telepathy ,and a power source so great and yet so small that it was never recognized.It is also a good point that the p-n junctions and lasers appear suddenly after many years of vacume tubes,without a real inventive process in between.  Philip mentions &quot;time machine&quot; on a t.v. show too. This would make a lot of sense.I suspect that these beings are our future relatives(or created by our future relatives) transported through areas like the bermuda triangle where a vortex of sea water interacts with the magnetic field.

Maugham visited Ramana's Ashram in South India once for a few hours and had a fainting fit there that seemed to be cured by the holy guru gazing at him till he awoke.......  Yes, truth is stranger than fiction!
0553573403|5.0|Outstanding character development!  Few of the characters are what we assume, one minute you loath them and the next you wish to champion their cause.  The only other author that does this succesfully is Guy Kay.  A truly epic fantasy!  Expect the unexpected!  You don't need to read far into the book before you realize that you can't anticipate the story, you must read on and let Martin tell his tale.  A Game of Thrones is an outstanding book!  Aftrer finishing the book I only hope that Martin continues to write, and fast!
0385472951|5.0|There is something inherrently needful about John Grishams newest book.  Deep inside all of us, there is a touch of the wanderer- a throwback to our days of heading ever west, to the great, untamed, unknown portions of our country, perhaps? Or even further back, when men roamed Europe, Africa and Asia, following the herds, fleeing hunger and strife?  Maybe - maybe not.  But Grishams books have always affected me on a deeply intellectual level - he takes one of the most complex subjects in the world - the law - and demystifies it, explains it in terms even I can understand.  The thought of running - no, more than that, hiding and changing your very life - is something that we all dream of, at least once.  Who hasn't wanted to drop it all and live in a cabin in the mountains or in a jungle in South America?  Grisham lets us explore our fantasies, and the darker side of them.  The only part of the novel that I was dissatified with was the end, and even that was understandable - realistic, even.  Read the book, and you'll understand what I mean.  It's thought provoking throughout, and definitely worth looking into, for old Grisham fans or new.
0893860220|5.0|As a graduate who has a degree in literature and minor in philosophy, I recommend this book.  His words offer a refreshing perspective on the subject of spirituality and how one should view themselves and others.  It has earned a place on my bookshelf and my guess it will on yours as well.  Enjoy the experience . . .
0812550706|5.0|From time to time, while reading sci-fi books, you stumble upon a book that surprises you with the new approach  to old themes. This is the case with Ender's Game. Alien invasion, xenophoby and military training looked through a new lense. Read it
067158037X|5.0|I read Mr. McCourt's work as he sat there speaking it to me - ever so patiently, without fuss, nor concern of my schenannigans as he took me through his young life in New York and Limmerick. God, I was enthralled to hear more and more with each tape (11 in all; the unabridged version is the only way to spend his time). <br />   I find that visual comprehension is not the same as auditory comprehension. What held my attention so rapturously was Mr. McCourt's youthful vigor, his insatiable bent on being a child to know. This kept my intent, my focus, my interest, my eye clear and took me by the hand as he walked me through his life as a mere child. His beauty in not knowing the bigger picture of life but feeling &quot;doomed&quot; was the same expectations I had felt for fear I also had done the inadmissable wrong. We are beyond comparisons in livelihoods; however, Mr. McCourt presents life through innocence, through detailed settings that take you on his journey because you want to &quot;go&quot; along and learn with young Frankie as he does too. <br />   Having no idea what this story was about, I took the chance it might be good. The library had a waiting list a mile long for the book, 'but only two people have the tape on hold.' No, I declined, I hate reading abridged versions of books. Well, the librarian said, it's 11 cassettes and that would probably signify unabridged. I requested a copy when it was available.<br />  I have never enjoyed such beauty in crafting a story as Mr. McCourt's efforts have proved: methodical, simple, grabbing glimpses of adults, institutions, the lanes, kids - older and younger - jobs and the hunger to get one, the fine print taste of hunger, the beauty of his mother and father, the laughter of his brothers. All done as if it were the next thing young Frankie would have done on his way to the fields, following his father's love for walks.<br />  Although the aftermath of reviews runs Mr. Malachy McCourt, Sr. through the mud as a low life, a no good, I saw much beauty in this man. A man with imagination, lots of pride, stubborness, love of words and creativity. A man caught in the likes of life as young Francis himself when he stepped off the boat in Poughkepsie, not knowing how to fill out his life's new surroundings after having met up with the drink and the excitement. Mr. McCourt, Sr. was found anew in young Francis - but like so many children, in all walks, Frank longed to feel secure in his father's admiration of him. <br />  Frank McCourt's efforts to put his young life's story into print proved to be a great find. And no, it was not blather. He brought even more to us in the arduous task of putting his story on tape. <br />  A beauty to treasure, Angela's Ashes is the story of our youth, past and today. What do you hear?
067631743X|5.0|It was the week before Christmas and all through the school, over-excited children were bouncing off the walls.  Then their teacher read The Polar Express, and they were hooked by the second page. By the end of the book, they were wide eyed and clamoring for their own bells to wear.  I ran right out and bought it for my nephew and half of the adults on my Christmas list.  I'm hoping to find it in my stocking next year.  Keep listening for the bells!
0380002930|5.0|This book is one of my favorites! Although many  people (as shown in the other reviews), who have only gotten to page three, have seen that it is a terrible book. But, in my perspective, I can not see how anyone, just plainly reading up to page three could rate the book a one or two or three. This book in inspiring, with the rabbits trying to make a new home. When I was reading the part in which Bigwig almost passed away in the trap, I even almost cried. Even though I'm only eleven, this book seems great for a reader who enjoys bunnies and a great adventure!
0393316041|5.0|I was flipping through TV channels one day, around 4 or 5 years ago, when I came upon a show with this guy playing bongo drums and singing about orange juice! Since I am a drummer, I was curious as to who the person was - he didn't look at all like a drummer. In fact, he looked more like a professor of some kind or another. I was intrigued and I kept watching this guy wailing away at the drums. Well, it of course turned out to be Richard Feynman. It was the first time I ever heard of Richard Feynman, but it was not the last. The TV show (it turned out to be a PBS special) was about Feynman and his quest to visit a place called Tuva something. Anyway, they talked about Feynman and his life in physics and teaching, and I was mesmorized. After watching this show, I purchased a copy of the book &quot;Surely, Your Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; and I have become a Feynman fan ever since. The book is inspirational. Feynman comes across as a &quot;doer&quot; who understands the difference between awareness and knowledge, and points out that you can only really ever know anything by doing. My only regret is that I never got to see a live Feynman lecture. However, one can follow his example and continually challenge themselves by separating facts from opinions and assumptions, and by proving the facts themselves (therein lies true knowledge). All in all, an amazing book I would recomend to just about anyone!
0345404475|5.0|I watched Blade Runner, the movie, a few years ago and couldn't quite grasped the implication (I was very young then, 12 or 14). Having watched the show again, read the book, listened to the soundtrack and played the game, I would say that Dick's version of Blade Runner is far more superior than the movie. The book explores the themes of what is real and unreal? Are replicants unhuman? Who are we to decide who is real or unreal? Who is God? For me, it painted a very possible scenario of the future -- Earth could very well end up up LA, 2019. I'm reading the rest of Dick's collection!

1561005533|5.0|River God was an excellent read.  I found it impossible to put down for long.  I &quot;loved&quot; Taita and his personality.  I became friends with Tanus and Lostrus and hated when the end came.  I could not wait to read the sequel.  It was exciting to travel in Egypt -- to heck with the history buffs and their complaints -- it was a great book and I'm delighted a friend pointed the way.

0345404475|5.0|I remember reading an interview with Philip K. Dick shortly before his death, in which he discussed the making of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and his reasons for writing the book. He said that his inspiration came from reading the diary of a Nazi prison camp commandante who complained that he was having difficulty sleeping because of the noise of crying children in the camp. Philip K. Dick was, of course, appalled at this incredible lack of empathy and asked himself, &quot;What does it do to your own humanity when you lose your ability to recognize the humanity of others?&quot;<br />  People familiar with Dick's other work will see the pattern. He majored in German in college and was preoccupied with the Nazis, who appear as embodiments of evil in a number of his books. I think &quot;Do Androids...&quot; exemplifies his creative ability to sublimate that preoccupation into a story that most people don't even realize comes from that particular source.<br />  Regarding the debate over the relationship between &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the book, I think both manage in different ways to capture Dick's mood and philosophical preoccupations. The movie is excellent, hypnotic in its visual imagery. The book is also excellent, but in a more philosophical, intellectual way.

0140131558|5.0|Congratulations -- you've just found a treasure.        When my cousin, a voracious reader of excellent books, told me that this is currently her favorite book, of course I immediately bought it (through Amazon.com).  I can see why she is so impressed.        What an amazingly original work.  It is sophisticated and writerly without being inscrutable or inaccessible.  And what a creative book it is -- the best way I can describe it is that this book keeps jumping in and out of its own covers, sometimes right into the reader's own skull and then back again.         I am amazed by Paul Auster's gift, and I hope to read all his other books  -- although first I want to reread this one immediately.  I feel certain that no matter how many times I read it, I will find new delights and insights each time.
0312853254|5.0|OSC is right (read his comment above) this IS his best book, and one of those rarities, a sequel that's better than its predecessor. A writer who deserves greater acclaim than he receives, OSC continually writes thought-provoking stories that place well-defined and complex characters in situations with no easy solutions. Speaker for the Dead is no exception.  In this, Ender must struggle with the guilt he feels as a result conflicts in Ender's Game, while simultaneously facing a similar dilemma/mystery in dealing with another alien culture. OSC  forces his characters--and the reader--to question assumptions about humanity and cultural bias (one of his recurrent themes), yet without descending to trite or specious morals. Moreover, he does this within the context of a damned good read--one of those &quot;up 'til 4 a.m.'cuz I couldn't put it down&quot; sort of reads. Probably my highest praise for Card would be to state that he's one of the two authors for whom I've stopped waiting for the (usually used!) paperback--I just buy the original hardcover because I know I'll not only enjoy his books, but will want to read them over and over.
0393038912|4.0|Dr. Diamond's book covers little in the way of new ground, but he does a reasonable job of bringing together some interesting recent work in a variety of fields, making this information available to those of us that are not professionals in these various areas.  Of course, much of what is here should be reasonably familiar to any well-educated person, but there were enough surprises to keep me going through the unfortunate repetitions scattered throughout the book.  Diamond dwells to excess on the Pacific area he's most familiar with.  It is understandably a micro-example of his wider premise, but surely others must be known as well, and the book could have benefited from additional examples from other geographic areas.<br />      Despite these problems, the basic premise of the book is well-defended and provides a clear and easy-reading statement of the author's ideas.

I would not hesitate to buy her next book, and would be happy to pay full price.<br />  Arundhati Roy RULES!!!
0385486804|4.0|I first was amazed, then disappointed, then puzzled by the matter in this book.  From the outset, I was saying, &quot;I would NEVER do that!  He must have been crazy; just ridiculous...&quot;  But, then I realized I was having trouble putting it down.  If I did not have the things around me which I love so much, and did have some of the same inner drive and courage, I would probably try something similar.  Krakauer's in-depth treatment of what appears to be something else shows us all some of the inner wanderer we sacrifice when we settle down into our ho-hum &quot;so-called&quot; lives.
1563523302|2.0|I applaud the book for restating, at least implicitly, that the more-is-better assumption to living life is a fallacy.  After all, the hallmark of the frugal life style is that more is not necessarily better at all.  I prefer the approach that there is something called &quot;enough&quot; that we all need to find out for ourselves.  I think a much better read on this subject is &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;, by Vickie Robin and Joe Dominguez.  This latter book gets to the core of the issue far better than the Millionaire Next Door.  Kudos to all who did not pay to read this book - who borrowed it from the library.

0684874350|5.0|As a native Irish person I can only describe Angela's Ashes as the most moving book I have read in the last ten years.  I feel that Frank McCourt has given me an education in an important part of twentieth century Irish history in the most effective way possible, through his personal experience of &quot;a poor catholic childhood in Limerick&quot;.<br />  It is a lesson to us all that the poverty and disease suffered by the McCourt family in Limerick were not merely caused by the drinking of Malachy but also by heartless government officials.<br />  The strenth of the book is the upbeat style of Frank McCourt.  As each incident of suffering is recounted by him as a small boy, his reaction is that of surprise and almost acceptance rather then anger and indignace. <br />  The way in which Angela McCourt strives to preserve her dignity at all times is heartwarming.  We can never despise the irresponsible actions of Malachy McCourt at any point in the book.  Also noteworthy, is the way Frank McCourt portrays the influence of the Catholic Church.  On the one hand providing guidence and education, and on the other hand, instilling ignorance and fear into a young boy.
0553260111|4.0|Ludlum's celebrated &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is really nothing more than a modern day reworking of A.Dumas'&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;(a &quot;10&quot; in any translation)...the story of revenge and repressed identity has a thrilling Mediterranean opening,.. before Ludlum widens the scope of the novel across the face of Europe...the sheer sweep of the book is almost irresistible, and places it at the  forefront of like genre thrillers;as a prose stylist,though, Ludlum is no Ambler or Greene.If you want to sample his work-this is the place to start....but just about any Frederick Forsyth novel of international intrigue will be better written and more accurate technically.
0553473050|4.0|Let's hear it for the underdog!!  Grisham weaves a clever tale of a law school grad going up against a huge corporation with its high-octane lawyers in a wrongful death suit.  You can't help but root for Rudy Baylor, the rookie lawyer.  There is, of course, the obligatory romance to spice things up, as well.  My only problem with the story was how Grisham trivializes the death of one of the characters in the book, an abusive husband, and how Baylor rides off into the sunset at the end (with his new love).  Good read!!!
0380973634|4.0|Although I know who and what Gaiman has done, I've never followed his work. Neverwhere is good.....a nice weave of fantasy and reality which is where it's strength lies. I thought the main characters needed more developing, but the concept is more than enough to intrigue.

044651506X|2.0|I was hooked within the first 200 pages.  I loved it. It was exciting it was believable.  I was telling everyone about this book and was thrilled to find on a road atlas, Plum Island restricted area just like the book!  But the twist in the story line killed it for me!  Stolen treasure!!! be serious.   It's like Mr. Demille left and another writer who obviously thought the story needed something finished it.  Is this customary for Demille?  I've purchased another one of his books and have not opened it for fear wasting my time.  I like surprises, but pirate treasure? -  from top secret government agencies, CIA, FBI, to   pirate treasure? Perhaps I missed something.
1563523302|5.0|As an economist, I worry about using the term &quot;research&quot; to apply to a historical accident.<br /> The main finding of this book, which is provocative and interesting, is that many people have accumulated wealth by patiently saving. Keep in mind that this book appears in 1997 in the United States.  The past 15 years in this country have been unique in the annals of history in the extent to which financial conditions have been aligned to reward savers and investors.<br /> Given the historical context, the research results are to be expected.  It would be much more surprising if they found similar results in the United States in 1980, or in Weimar Germany in 1930, or in Southeast Asia today.<br /> Nonetheless, I heartily endorse the advice to &quot;live within your means.&quot; I cannot think of anyone who has regretted doing so.  With my own children, my fervent hope is that they will grow up to resist mass media consumerism and focus instead on personal relationships and their role in the community.  I hope that they live within their means, regardless of whether that leads to accumulating a big bank account.<BR> Arnold Kling
0684874350|5.0|Because I was &quot;raised Irish,&quot; had a grandfather who was born in Ireland, and have myself visited the homeland, I would like to pitch in my two cents worth and add, with some reservation, to the chorus of acclaim for this little masterpiece. <br />      Angela's Ashes is an extremely well-crafted work of literature; it is an artistic interpretation of life; it has the permanent power to rouse profound emotions.  That and more!  Frank Mc Court has manipulated the range and depth of the reader's emotions from joy to abject sorrow so skillfully that one is sometimes driven to laugh and weep almost simultaneously. In the words of Lincoln Steffans (&quot;A Miserable Merry Christmas&quot;) describing a similar experience, 'It covered the whole distance from broken-hearted misery to bursting happiness -- too fast.  A grownup could hardly have stood it!'  <br />      McCourt's characterization of his complex father is suberb;  from this flawed man he received his greatest gifts. The book is rich in comic exaggeration, which is an ingredient of his artistry.  I take issue, however, with his shabby treatment of the Catholic Church which borders on the sacrilegious.  Further, his revealing the degradation of his long-suffering mother is neither necessary nor honorable, however the artistic merit. It is, rather, an injustice and a shameful exploitation. <br />       Frank McCourt: Which of your special, unique brothers would you have eliminated to insure a better quality of life for the remainder?  Which would the reader wish had never been conceived?  I myself rejoice in the gift of each, and mourn the untimely death of the twins and the infant sister, longing for the unfilled promise of their lives. All life is precious and the human spirit prevails even in the face of  abject poverty and perverse sinfulness, a theme which McCourt so skillfully illustrates.
0553103547|4.0|Having read many epic fantasy novels it is difficult to find new and interesting material that will keep my attention. From David Eddings' fast paced, but numerous, stories to Robert Jordan's highly detailed works my interest is broad.<br />Martin's The Game Of Thrones sits somewhere in-between the Eddings and Jordan.  It has enough detail to make the world interesting and enough stories within the book to keep you reading.  The story does take a while to grab hold of you but once it has you, you will be greatly anticipating the next book, as I am.
0345350499|5.0|After reading many, many books dedicated to The Legend of Authur, it was refreshing to read this spellbinding tale from the perspective of the women involved with Authur.<br /> I look forward to reading &quot;Forest House,&quot; and &quot;The Lady of Avalon.&quot; <br />I highly recommend &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; to all who enjoy Authur and the Roundtable.

I highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good novel, even if you don't usually enjoy history or romance novels, please give it a try.
0140072187|5.0|I prefer to read books on Vietnam based on real life experiences,  and written by the people who where there.  I have read at least 12 different books based on the Vietnam war and find Robert Masons Chickenhawk the most inforamtive and enthralling book on the war that I have ever read.  From the flying of grunts into hot LZ's to medi-vac, and supply hops, you feel like your a passenger riding in the back seat the whole time.  He has succeded in painting the whole pitcure of life in Vietnam, and I would highly recommend both  of Robert Masons books on his life during and after Vietnam.
0440539811|5.0|I was never to big a reader in high school.  I was thoughtful and inquisitive, but I was always more interested in my friends synopses of books than I was in reading them myself.  I had a great group of experimental, intellectual and artistic friends.  The one book that was a constant topic of disscussion at that time was &quot;The Illuminatus Trilogy.&quot;  Many of my friends had read it and were constantly conversing about it.  I had always been intimidated by it's size, and I don't read very fast. Later,I went to college, which forced me to read more. Slowly but surely, I began to take interest in books, and began to catch up on many of the catalystic books that, vicariously, helped to form my personality.  My junior year of college I was studying art and art history in Florence, Italy.  I had no homework from my classes, and no television.  I had some good friends, but could only hang out with them so much.  I told my friend Scott (the first of my friends to read the Illuminatus)to bring the book when he came to visit.  We toured Europe for a while and then I returned to Florence for another semester.  I picked up the Illuminatus, and some buds that I smuggled back to  Florence from Amsterdam, and began to read.  At first I found the text a bit confusing, but slowly I was able to get into it.  I found myself entering a world that I never knew I lived in.  I began to see so many things, that I had always taken for granted, for how they really were.  I was so hooked that from the moment I would get home from class I would light a candle (electricity is very expensive over there), smoke a bud, and dig in.  I found my mind expanding over the time I read.  I began to recognize the ordinary more than I ever had before.  It even had a great effect on my artistic process and my thoughts on art theory.  I never made it through the last part of the trilogy because of other interests that had taken root at the time.  It wasn't necessary for me to finish it though.  It still managed to have a profound impact on my life, and now as I begin to partake of &quot;Schrodinger's Cat Trilogy&quot; (also by Robert Anton Wilson), I find it necessary to spread the knowledge and experience that the &quot;Illuminatus&quot; has given me.  You can reach a certain illumination from reading it as so many others have, and will be enabled to find reason in so much of the chaos of the world.
0385472951|2.0|Grisham has now written the same book several times - a woman and man virtually alone against a world (including the FBI) out to get them. Here they are in The Partner.  The writing is, as ever, utterly pedestrian.  And how many times do we need to be told that someone is drinking coffee?  A change this time is the ending, a splendid piece of irony but so out of character with the rest of the book that it can only seem utterly contrived, a dea ex machina (albeit going in a direction opposite to the usual).  All of the above notwithstanding, I continue to read just about everything Grisham writes.  When I have time to kill, or am ensconced in my chamber, or away from my firm, or with no clients to see, or lacking a partner, then Grisham does have a certain analgesic effect.

0140158766|5.0|Walking through the bookstore and suddenly finding a sequel to Chickenhawk, I was estatic and couldn't wait to get home and start reading it.  It is a great continuation of what was one of the best books on Vietnam I have read to date.  It shows what life was like for one vietnam vet after the war.  From failed businesses to drug smuggeling and a stint in federal prison,  it was as much of a page turner as the first book was.

His pal and partner Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) steals his gal Lyla at the last minute, so Jim takes up the life of a farmer on his own. Unfortunately for Jim, the farm life drives him nuts. He decides to turn the farm into an inn, where he can do entertainment shows for every holiday.

0385486804|5.0|This book perfectly captures the dangers of feeling too much, thinking too much, reading too much, and being hurt too much.  Krakauer, who reveals much of his own idealism in this book, investigates the death by starvation of an idealistic Emory graduate Chris McCandless, aka Alexander Supertramp. Krakauer follows the journey of McCandless, conjectures several possible reasons for his demise, interjects the stories of several idealistic young men (including himself), and interviews everyone he could find who met McCandless during the two years between his disappearance from Atlanta and the discovery of his body in a schoolbus outside the Denali National Park in Alaska.  A must-read for anyone who has ever considered leaving it all or going out for a life of adventure in America.  Krakauer skillfully addresses the reasons why people in America are attracted to the idea of the wilderness at a level that is extremely attractive to non-literary fans.  Thoreau, Melville, Twain, and Tolstoy (among others) are quoted throughout the book from passages highlighted in books found with McCandless' body which effectively shelight on this tragic story.
0399128964|5.0|The book &quot;Dune&quot; could have been written in any time period.  The general plot of good versus evil takes on new meaning when you end up not being sure just exactly who was good and who was bad.  The development of the characters in this book place Herbert in the same league as Dickens.  I have read the book several times and each time I read it, it almost seems new because I find a greater insight into its' plot.  I have been reading science fiction for more years than I care to admit, and would place this book among the top ten ever written.
0684874350|2.0|This book was great right up until the last few pages and then...WHAT?  After that horrible childhood of poverty, he did WHAT?  He steals money from a dead woman and gets HIMSELF out of poverty, leaving everyone else behind without so much as a fare-thee-well, has a tawdry fling with some low-lifes and decides that he has finally arrived?  Didn't he learn anything at all from his mother's struggles?  Shame on the author for telling tales that reflect so poorly on himself and, by extension, on the mother that raised him!

1573220485|2.0|This is really little better than Jeffrey Archer. I found it an engaging read but ultimately wholly implausible, full of dead ends of undeveloped plot and written in a rather pedestrian prose. Simply quoting Conrad won't buy you any credibility here. We are meant to believe that life on the Island is some sort of paradise though it sounds suffocatingly boring and I really can't imagine these youngsters putting up with it. The idea that the whole thing was tolerated by some PC drug dealers is laughable. The one real moment of tension is Richard's surfacing in the unexpected air hole but that turns out to be unimportant. Lousy plotting. Hopeless. Read Sam Shepard's Cruising Paradise if you want to know how to write.
0804102988|5.0|If you couldn't tell I thought this was one of best books I have ever read.  I lived in England for several years and visited Sarum/Stonehenge several times. If you can't make it to England this book is the next best thing. The only caveat I would give is that it is quite long.  But don't let that stop you from picking it up.  The book will keep you captivated as the linage of the characters unfold.
1563523302|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  By the authors' criteria, my wife an I are considered wealthy at age 36 and 33.  We got that way by virtually mirroring the book's advice. It was great to read the book and find out that our approach to life and wealth has now been validated. <br /> I would add one more chapter, however:  on the defensive side of wealth accumulation, one should do things around the home for themselves rather than calling professional repairmen (plumbers, electricians, painters) or other craftsman (deck builders, roofers, concrete guys) at every juncture.  This type of work is not really all that hard or complicated once you understand the basics ( I knew nothing about any home improvement project when I bought my first home, but I've learned!)....but the cost savings, learning experience, and personal satisfaction from doing a project yourself are well worth the effort. <br /> I have saved a lot of money this way, and increased the value of and improved my home. In addition, I'm spending my spare time productively, teaching my son the value of hard work and to be self-reliant, and spending time with him....and that part is priceless!
1563523302|5.0|A good companion to this book is &quot;Die Broke.&quot; It also deals with the philosophy of money, and includes advice on how to save toward a goal for enjoyment, not just to leave your children an inheritence. The fact is, many do get rich through conservative spending and investing-just look at our parents.
1563523302|3.0|This book has a great start, then it just repeats itself. What a waste of time.  I agree that it would have made a great pamphlet or essay.  Invest your $15 elsewhere and borrow your soon to be millionaire next door neighbors' book for a night.
0312853238|4.0|Amidst the dozens of commentaries on Ender's<BR> Game, a key point has been missed.<BR> <br /> The joy (or perhaps, the horror) of this book<BR> is that it serves as a portrait of much adult<BR> life in the 1990s.  This is no more a child's<BR> book than Wind in the Willows, which mirrors<BR> vivid -- albeit humorous -- pictures of<BR> personalities each of us know.<BR> <br /> Ender is a mirror of the pain and fatigue of <BR> our time, not the humor.  Ender is Card's<BR>  Sisyphus, ever forced to compete at <BR> increasingly difficult levels, only to be told<BR> that his best performances are insufficient.<BR> &quot;Every level harder and there will be no <BR> help,&quot; serves as his mantra, as he rolls<BR> the rock to the hilltop yet again.<BR> <br /> If Ender triumphs in the end, it is despite <BR> the duplicity of government and at the cost <BR> of his inability to form lasting attachments.<BR> <br /> Wagner's Wotan perishes in his impotence<BR> to save.  Sisyphus triumphs through steely<BR> indifference (&quot;melancholy people have two<BR> reasons for being so:  they don't know or <BR> they hope,&quot; Camus said).  Ender perseveres and<BR> emerges victorious, but at what price?  And<BR> that, indeed, is the question with which Ender<BR> challenges us to examine ourselves in the 90s.<BR> <br />
0446310786|5.0|I was forced to read To Kill a Mockingbird in eighth grade as a school reading assignment.  Being a science fiction fan, I wasn't too enthusiastic.  But as I got into the story, I soon realized it wasn't just any old book.  This story was intreguing.  I think I finished the book in one evening.  I just couldn't put it down.  I had to read the book again my junior year in high school.  I figured it would be an easy assignment.  After all, I had already read the book.  But since I had to write a paper on it, I sat down to re-read the story.  And once again, I couldn't put it down.  I knew the story, knew what was going to happen, yet I still found the story enthralling.  Harper Lee's talent for writing has created a wonderful story, told through the innocent eyes of young Scout Finch.  By showing all of the events from Scout's point of view, Lee shows us how we should act, prejudice free.  She proves that each person needs to be looked at for who they are, not for what others say they are.
0345350499|5.0|This book was one that kept me up 'till the wee hours, but for all the lost sleep it was worth it. There are a lot of Arthurian books out there but weave quite the same spell that Marion Zimmer Bradly does. Definently a must read.
0606045740|5.0|I loved this story and how Einstein brought Nora and Travis together.  I wish he would write a sequel so we can dream about the future possibilities of Einsteins offspring.  Come on Dean Koontz, write a sequel, PLEASE!!!
0440539811|5.0|I can imagine a very creative person taking LSD and concocting a pointless shaggy dog story like The Illuminatus Trilogy.  What I cannot comprehend is why the same person would not come to his senses after the trip was over and toss this ridiculous piece of garbage in the trash where it belongs.<br />In his non-fiction writings, co-author Wilson has revealed that he believes in at least some of the New Age, paranormal nonsense promoted by this irritating, asinine book.
0345423496|2.0|If you are a Clarke fan, if you do not know much about computer viruses (virii?), if you like short-short chapters with not much material on them, and if you are willing to forget &quot;2061: Odissey Three&quot; ever existed, THEN you may like 3001.<br />  The comments regarding computer viruses are ludicrous (locking them up in a vault so they cannot infect anything? burning a robot which handled such a virus in order to disinfect him?).  Forgetting all what happened in 2061 --which has become a non-entity-- is not justifiable. The link between Bowman, Hal and Floyd in order to solve the problem of Lucifer's extinction looked interesting... but it's no more.  Furthermore, there is something illogical going there. Much of the novel hinges on the problems of FTL (Faster Than Light) travel and information sent out to a place 450 light years away but the Monolith was a sort of star gate which allowed FTL travel, so why the delay?
0684874350|4.0|I bought this book because, 23 years ago, I was one of the many students who took Frank McCourt's very popular Creative Writing course at Stuyvesant High School.  Frank stressed a particular theme in his teaching: good writing is suprising.  Forget every lesson previous English teachers have taught, or else you'll produce platitudes, not creative writing.  He hammered this lesson home in everything he taught.  He made us read satire.  He assigned writing tasks that sounded prosaic and made fun of us if we wrote something prosaic.  For example, he asked us to write a love letter and a hate letter.  He liked my love letter to a dead dog.  He adored Jonathan G's obscenely funny hate letter to a public figure.  Frank was completely at ease with students, he was charismatic, he entertained us, he spoke with us and never down to us, and yet he was always an authority figure.  And he talked constantly about his brother Malachy, who at the time hosted a New York area radio show.  <br />The first chapter of _Angela's Ashes_, about McCourt's earliest childhood in Brooklyn, New York, brought me back to my high school friendship with Jessica O'C.  I recall Jessica, who was so proud of being Irish-American, because her family's troubles sound so much like those of Frank McCourt's family, and Frank McCourt sees these troubles as characteristically Irish.  Ireland, devastated and robbed repeatedly by the English, beset with European class distinctions and snobberies, structured by the inscrutable Roman Catholic Church, cursed physiologically or culturally with a craving for alcohol, had only a harsh life to offer many of its people.  Disabled or alcoholic fathers allowed their hard-to-find jobs to lapse, their families to starve; babies and toddlers died from parental ignorance, from cold, wet, crowded, filthy housing, their immune systems weak from months or years of gradual starvation.  In these impoverished conditions, however, just as in my friend's family, surprisingly educated intelligences flourished, songs and stories were traded, and dazzling bits of beauty were rendered tragic by their surroundings.    <br />Frank McCourt describes all of this through the eyes of a gradually maturing child.  At first the child sees only what is immediate: his family, the relationships that are the substance of his life.  As his circle widens, he begins to glimpse the social and religious conditions that structured his childhood.  He learns more about his parents' lives and begins to appreciate the tragedy of the unforeseen turns their lives have taken.  Irish songs and myths animate his telling of the story, anchoring it culturally in the pleasure the Irish take in recitation, in the ways his own life repeats the songs, in the interpretive lens these songs and stories must have offered his earlier childish understandings of life.  <br />McCourt takes seriously the principle he taught his writing students: go for the unusual, the surprising.  The story unfolds through what looks on paper like Irish idioms, Irish customs, Irish understandings.  As the story's narrator matures, the perspective always shifts slightly.  And the reader is always a bit on edge emotionally, as McCourt shifts back and forth between the comic and the tragic, never allowing the reader to become bored with an emotional plateau.  (Just when I thought I couldn't take any more dead babies, for example, just as tears were streaming down my cheeks and I was about to put down the book for good, McCourt launched into a wonderful satire of the Catholic Church, through the eyes of a little boy studying for his First Communion.)  <br />The book jacket also says &quot;Winner of the Pulitzer Prize.&quot;  I agree, it's a good book.  It hardly matches an old Pulitzer prizewinning book I read recently, Annie Dillard's _Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_ for philosophical depth, scientific breadth, or even sheer literacy.  But it drew me into its world.  Bits of the book kept popping up in my memory,and I often mistook them for fragments of my own recent dreams.  Scenes from the book seemed to play on the horizon of my den as I attempted to engage in routine activities, like building block towers with my children.  Not only did the book draw me in, however, it also dumped me back out into my own world with some fresh understandings about Ireland, poverty, childhood, character, determination, satire, my high school writing teacher, and, of course, writing and storytelling themselves.
0385121679|5.0|The Shining is one of the most well written books there have ever been.  It  is the result of the master of horror himself putting his mind into the story.  It immediately  became far and away the best novel I have ever read.  Stephen King has a masterpiece in this story which has created a legacy that will live on long after we have all come and gone.
0812548094|4.0|The longest part of a roller-coaster ride is the climb to the top.  The majority of this book was the climb to the top.  There was some good points. The part with Richard shooting with the mud people was interesting.  The thng I didnt like about this book was when richard solved all of this problems in about 5 pages (not actually, that's the way it felt). But it was a pretty good sequel.  I will still read the rest of the series.
0802130208|5.0|From the opening paragraph, I was prepared to loathe Ignatius Reilly, the obese, pompus, over-educated, lute-playing sloth!  After just a few pages of his hilarious mishaps, however, I was hooked.  He and all the other lunatic characters made me laugh so hard while reading it on a plane that a flight attendant had to bring me a glass of water.  Toole was a genius; who else could intertwine Ignatius among plot lines involving a bumbling rookie police officer, the heir to the Levy Pants empire, a sex-crazed activist, gays, bowlers, criminals, and sundry other kooks?  You must read this book.
0140049975|5.0|Steinbeck's East of Eden is a masterpiece. It is at once an epic narrative, a human drama, a journey through lives and generations. It is also a very simple story--that of original sin, of brothers and sons and fathers, of love. You might think that it is long, and it is--but once you get going time will fly because you're having fun!
0671004107|3.0|I agree that this novel was creative . . . for a non-fiction writer.  It provided an excellent basis for one of the best movies I've seen of late.  I am definitely not a conformist, however, and I don't regret to say that when Mr. Sagan presented his opinions of the different factions of life, he didn't consider a valid arguement:  that science and religion are inherently inseperable.  The novel is presented like a prolonged debate between the theological line of thinking and the equally unlimited world of the scientific reality.  It is essentially an arguement, although it appears to be passive.  The characters in the novel exemplify the limitations of both lines of thinking by not allowing them to intermingle.  It places a stone wall where maybe none is needed.   Yeah, the book makes you think, as you can tell by my comments, but by no means does it represent existance as it likely is, only a few ideas of what it could be.
0385474547|4.0|Speaking as someone with a minimal exposure to non-Western literature, I was surprised that this book was as easy to read and understand as it was.  The story is timeless.  The perspective on a traditional African society was fascinating and full of detail.
0684874350|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Can't believe anyone could actually survive such terrible living conditions! But Frank McCourt writes in such a way that even though I feel sorry for the family, I also feel a whole lot of respect for their resilience. I like the way Frank McCourt writes- as if he is talking to you as a child. He manages to describe his living environment so as to enable us to have a clear and vivid picture of his hometown, but at the same time he doesn't bore us with complicated details and long-winded &quot;talk&quot;. I also really enjoyed the innocence and humour which  seems to have been an important part of the writer's life. I think this keeps the tone from turning into one of self-pity. I think Frank McCourt is a great writer and I hope there's a sequel to this wonderful memoir.
0684874350|5.0|When I finished this touching memoir, I realized that a man with these gifts chose to teach in the New York City public schools. Perhaps there is hope for our schools after all.
0684874350|5.0|I listened to Frank McCourt describe his childhood on the Rosie O'Donnell show and was interested to read more. As I looked at the cover and read his line, &quot;Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood. Worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.&quot;, I was more intrigued then ever. Even though the story was deeply moving, his struggle to make his life better inspired me. I cannot wait for the sequel to this book to pick up in New York with Mr. McCourt. This book should be an absolute read for anyone feeling depressed about their circumstances. Mr. McCourt's vivid descriptions made me feel like I was standing in his house at times. Thank you for sharing your story with us.
0893815187|5.0|I was unaware of the controversy regarding Mrs. Mann's work until recently and find the harsh words totally unwarranted and the attitudes unbelievable. This book reflects her understanding of what it's like to be a child in a rural  environment and has NOTHING to do with pornography.  <br /> The nudity which some find so shocking is natural for kids. It's not until later when we learn our bodies are &quot;bad&quot; that we stop displaying them. That some attach the nudity in the shots of her children with sex speaks poorly of them and  those who perpetuate this attitude.  <br /> This is a wonderful book that most of you will appreciate and identify with, making you recall memories of your own youth. And, if you were brought up in a suburban area you'll even learn some of what it's like being a kid in the  country. However, if your looking for a book with snapshots of smiling kids, you'll be disappointed. This is a photo essay on an all too brief time of our lives, with the pictures being neither cute nor pretty, the photographer having chosen  instead to show emotion and reality, and has done so beautifully.
0553208845|5.0|I rarely give tens to anything.  However, I feel very strongly that this book is a must-read for anyone who feels lost.  I read this book last year, as a high school senior, at the suggestion of my English teacher.  After wading through a beginning that I thought was somewhat discouraging, I found myself being spoken to on a level that I have never found before.  At a time in my life when I felt lost in a whirlwind of forced maturity, I found myself calmed and comforted by a book I thought was just an assignment.  Alongside Siddhartha, I found myself learning from my hardships and seeking out my own path.  That was a much-needed dose of courage when I had none.  Now I find myself in college.  My first semester was not what I had long hoped for, and I again feel lost.  I find solace in Siddhartha, relearning the lessons that he taught me.  Hermann Hesse wrote a masterful book about finding one's path, and by doing so, he showed me the way.  In this cynical world, inspiration like that is hard to come by....
0312932081|5.0|This book is one that people all over love.  Whether they regularly read SF or not, they love.  I have a friend who rarely reads, but he read the entire book, because it was so engrossing.  And Ender is so good because he is so realistic.  A poor little kid stuck in grown up affairs.  And in the end, he gets very tired, and that is what makes him realistic.  And the guy who said that 12 and 10 year-old kids couldn't influence popular thought is wrong.  He is just afraid of that happening and doesn't want to admit it is possible.  There are kids like that, not jus the ones who graduate high school when they are 10, but the ones that have a purpose and know what they are doing.  A genetic mutation creating a person capable of being Alexander the Great at 12 is not that unlikely.
0802130208|5.0|I read the early reviews, then tried to read the book. I got angry after maybe 50 pages and threw it in a fire! The first and only book I ever burned. I felt manipulated and let down by the writer's postmodern refusal to give readers any reason to sympathize with characters. Then a couple years later I read it again and finished it. This time it was the funniest thing ever. It was so original. It has the oddest twists and some very deep holes. Comedy and tragedy are closer than we think. I came back because of a newfound love for outside artists and the unpublishable (Jack Saunders). Also, perhaps I like it so much better *in comparison to establishment books*. Sure, it's not the only wacky book, but it's just so accurate and wild. I liked the surprising unevenness, too. Maybe I also finally saw thru what real manipulation is like (the slick pros like Tom Robbins, Heinlein, Harrison, McGuane, Heller). I thought they were all fresh at first, then I realized they were often schticking with formula and cynicism. Toole was too far out for that. Toole hits formula over the head with a bat and I appreciate it. Others do too, but they have NO humility---Toole does pathetic like no one else. (His suicide was a great tragedy of our brown-nosing literary system, but I'm sure it's the same fate as most other attempts at honesty in a logrolling PC elitist cynical world.)
0517122707|5.0|I started reading this book expecting to be in stitches with laughter.  I was surprised that I found it very sad.  All the sadder because we will never be able to enjoy more books by this author.  The book is so well written that I could smell Ignatius's room.  I could visualize the floor strewn with paper covered with words that only had meaning to Ignatius.  I felt sad about the situation he and his mother found themselves in trying to keep ahead of the bill collectors.  Sad because this overeducated man had presumably been protected from life by his mother.  This is a wonderful book.  I did find it humorous in parts, but for the most part I just felt sad.
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork, Icelandic siren-songstress, does it again with a little help from her friends. Eumir Deodato, Mark Bell, and her pal Howard Bernstein,  are among her current collaborators. The songs are of one flavor, she explains, hence the title.  Backed by the Icelandic string quartet and a DJ with techno beats, her voice soars and dips, like a bird on the wing.   Poet Sjon again contributes some  lyrics: &quot;Bachelorette&quot; is their sequel to Post's &quot;Isobel&quot;: &quot;I'm a tree that grows hearts, one for each that you take.&quot; &quot;Joga&quot; is an ode to Bjork's best friend: &quot;every nerve that hurts, you heal&quot;.  Homogenic is Bjork's most personal effort to date,  and a collection of songs that leaves one insatiable for those to come.     END
0887307396|5.0|This book is an excellent study of the fundamental ingredients that go into visionary companies.  These companies first and foremost are concerned with core values that sway every business decision they make.  It is interesting to read this book and wonder what companies will succeed in the long term.  Will Microsoft?  Will your company?  It looks doubtful for me.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess does an incredible job of showing the reader the importance of free will.  He asks the question of whether or not it is worth taking away a persons free will just to make society happy.  This is an incredible book about one young mans journey through crime, punishment, and coming of age in a time not to far from now.
0440111498|5.0|&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a great introduction to the world and style of Kurt Vonnegut. It was the first book of his I read and certaintly not the last. His witty style and comic ideas make this a must-read for anyone who likes humor and science-fiction. While it may not be his best work, it definitely deserves attention and merit for being so humorous and yet having such a deep, underlying purpose. It is essential, pure, unadultered Vonnegut!
0452273331|5.0|Wow.  Set aside the philosophical arguments.  Please.  Hands down, this novel was one of the best I've read.  Not because of any literary prowess or commanding plot.  This book really made me think.  It is rare that one can sit down, for pleasure, read a book, for pleasure, and accidentally fumble upon a set of views that challenge those previously held.  While The Fountainhead made me consider my ethics, it also altered them.  I shall not delve into how.  This is what the book is all about.  This is why I give it such a high rating.  Miss Rand succeeded in telling an idealistic story of the ideal man.  While he may not change us fully, Howard Roark makes us look in the mirror a tad more closely.
0451169514|5.0|I have read IT 74 times. I am not kidding. I read it for the first time when I was twelve.I had just seen the movie, and that was brilliant. I am now 19, and I read the book at least once a month. I don't feel complete without Bill, Ben, Bev, Stan, Mike, Eddie and Ritchiein my life. I found myself wondering why I couldn't have had a friendship as great as theirs, ableto conquer any evil. I cried when Stephen had us looking back and saying goodbye to the children.I often wonder where such a heartbreaking, scary, wonderous tale could have possibly come from.The answer is of course, the mind of KING. How befitting his last name is, because with this taleof innocence, love, and grasping fear, King proves himself to be the greatest writer of all time.His imagination is so deep and intense, it leaves you weeping for the loss of Eddies life, laughing along with the characters, and breaking with their love for each other. I always wonder what happened to the characters after the story had ended.When discussing the book with friends, the lucky seven are always refferred to as it they were real peopleKing has the ability to suck you into his tales until you believe every word he says to be the truth. Because,after all fiction is the truth inside the lie.How can you put a review of this masterpeice into words? How can you describe this work of art that is morethan a book, but as it's relative, The Stand, a legend and a book that cannot and will not be forgotten.The answer is simple - you can't. You just have to read the book for yourself!
0345350499|1.0|I have long loved Bradley's 'Darkover' novels, but as an Arthurian scholar I was sorely diappointed in her treatment of my favorite legends.  Rather than retelling the legend from a feminine (ie: Morgana/Viviane viewpoint) she has produced a pointless soap-opera of pseudo-Arthuriana and bad paganism.  If you are into good Arthurian fiction try Mary Stewart's &quot;Crystal Cave&quot; series or Gillian Bradshaw's &quot;Hawk of May&quot;/&quot;Kingdom of Summer.&quot;  If you are a budding neo-pagan and you want &quot;real druids&quot; (as so many fans of this book seem to think it has) try a history book or face the fact that this is both bad history and bad fantasy.  Try Parke Godwin or Persia Woolley for good fantasy with good historical background.  Go back to Darkover, Marion, and try again--this book was not worth the paper it was printed on and the best hope for those who liked it is they may grow up eventually and discover real Arthuriana.
0345363132|5.0|I really enjoyed &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot; because it was well written, exciting and very factual.  It is also about time that people understand that Richard of York was portrayed in a particular way because historians were commissioned by the Tudors and thus had to make them look good and the house of York appear to be evil.  It's nice to have the record straightened.
0812034465|5.0|This book was required for my summer high school 10th grade reading. First thought-yeah, yet one more book about the pains of growing up in the early 1900's.  Well, the book proved otherwise.  When reading, I really began to feel as if I was a part of the Finch family.  Truly, Harper Lee writes a book of humor, relationships, trauma-all necessary characteristics of a well-written novel.  To Kill A Mockingbird really gave me the perspective of the mysteries the Finch children had to uncover-Boo Radley especially.  I throughly enjoyed this novel.
0517591812|2.0|I was so looking forward to Rutherford's next book.  I had read Sarum and Ruska and was anxiously awaiting an engrossing new read.  But I was dissapointed with London.  It did not have the same grip to it that the earlier two did.
0380018179|5.0|This book was very much a page-turner.  I read in it any chance I got, but McCullough collaborates quite a few fairly boring parts with a some very romantic passages.  I found myself forgetting a couple important details because they were incorporated within sluggish portions of the novel.  It does not flow as well as the end, for it jumps around between characters too much.  All in all, though, it was a book worth reading.
0872860175|1.0|Even critics who are sympathetic to Ginsberg, such as David Perkins in his &quot;History of Modern Poetry,&quot; admit that he was a one-hit wonder.  T. S. Eliot pointed out, speaking of Milton, that a poet can be great but still exercise a bad influence on those who follow him.  I myself, speaking of &quot;Howl,&quot; would use words very similar to those Tennyson used in describing &quot;Sordello&quot; -- I liked only the first line of it.  There are better free verse poets than Ginsberg, just as there are better critics of America than Ginsberg.
0380730405|5.0|I concur with everyone else's high praise of &quot;Rebecca.&quot; For another book in the same vein, I suggest that du Maurier fans try Anya Seton's &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (if you're lucky enough to find a copy!).
0385311400|3.0|As many other readers, I was disappointed. Books one and two were so very good, the third &quot;Voyager&quot;, was wrenching, especially Jamie`s prison experiences, but then it became a bit of a travelogue, a bit dragging in places, but still very good! Now, this one really was much flatter. I mean, there are still axceptional scenes and laugh-out-loud-moments, the language is wonderful, but it is superficial. Brianna acts so often like a spoiled child, and the whole sequence of Roger first making love to her, then disappearing after just one night and by mistake being &quot;thrown to the Indians&quot; by her family, oh, come on, this really sound like the cloak and dagger stuff from old romances! Also, you got this feeling of pages that have to be filled and time that has to be spent before we get to the next really interesting things, a bit like being with people in their everyday lives after sharing all the high drama before - a bit of a letdown. Well, I was disappointed, the tension was just not there and I really put the book down for weeks before reading on - I don't think I will buy her next book as a hardcover, seems a waste of money! - But yes, it was still so good that I will definitely read on through the series.
0679459529|2.0|When it was first written, 3001 brought us a world of amazement in a far-fetched Universe. It seemed to discuss advances that mankind would ulitmately make and in our near future, and discusses some very deep questions. This is disscussed and continued in 2010, and 2061, where the plot continues to build up to what should be a stunning climax. However, I say that 3001 MIGHT be a worthy continuation, but not a finale to one of the greatest Science-fiction epics of all time.<BR>  <br />When I purchased the book, I was expecting a deep novel that would leave me thinking, what I got was a very mundane explanation to an Epic. All Clark does is try to bring 3001 in to the Computer age, which kills some of the beauty of the series.<BR>  <br />From the very begining, I knew it would not be the Epic I imagined, when it launched into a lengthy (but admittedly interesting) speech on the third Millenium. The rest of the book seemed rushed to come to an ending in the fewest pages possible.<BR> <br />Though I admit that it would be difficult to end such a series, I think such a brilliant writer as Clark could do better than this.
155800145X|2.0|Arte Johnson gives a wonderful interpretation of the characters' voices and accents.  However, the development of Ignatious' personality suffers greatly due to the severity of the abridgement.  The plot thread is retained, but many amusing asides and some of the more colorful vocabulary are missing.  I would not recommend the audio cassette to anyone who has not read the original version of this exceptional novel.
0345403959|3.0|I can not believe that people who have read the Belgariad can say that this book is &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;magnificent&quot; or that this is the &quot;best work of Eddings yet&quot;.  They must have read a different edition than I. To me, this book was an unexiting recount of happenings that we already knew took place. There is absolutely zero character development in the story (except for Polgara's sudden change of appearence) for any of the other players, in fact Eddings makes a great effort to show that characters stay the same over the centuries in the families. The humour of the book is very repetitive and is tiring after the first 100 pages. In the Belgariad, Belgarath goes into great pains not to reveal to others (especially Garion) what forces are at work. In this book, he distributes this information freely to everyone, making people do his bidding by saying that an &quot;EVENT&quot; is taking place. I agree with the opinion of one of the previous readers,  all over the story it feels as if this book has been written by someone else. WARNING: Do not read this book before reading the Belgariad and the Malloreon. (all other books are far-far better anyway)
0425129586|5.0|This book is amazing! I may be only 13 but this is one of the best books I have read! It keeps you in supence and you wont want to put the book down till you have finished it!<br /> Agathat Christie gives massive details, along with mezmorizing murders. This book really gets you mind working in trying to figure out who the murder, and the host is. I couldn't put the book down!!<br /><br />This book is rather amazing, I recomend this book to anyone who is looking for a great murder mystery. Also, to anyone who is a true Agatha Christie fan should know that this book deserves nothing but the highest rating. IT'S A 10!!!<br /><br /> I COULD READ THIS BOOK OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!
