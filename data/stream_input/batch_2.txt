B001B5EBUI|5|Love it don't know how long it is going to last but it feels great. Still going  strong just like stock good product works very well. Buy it works fine.
B004LF54X8|2|Nice size rug I had to return because it was just not solid enough for my porch would just be blown away.
B00SLR0T64|5|easy insall and plenty of power.
B00KXMEMVI|4|Well made. I've used it at the beach it works well. Holds gear too good range bag.
B0070NG8JC|5|The chrome looks so pretty added to the chrome already present on the car
B0050SG9KW|5|Great product OTC is the way to go. Easy to use and a great storage case.
B00TM7BGZ0|5|Love the new speakers. Let's both driver and passenger enjoy quality sound.
B00MXG8GPK|5|Stuck it on my desk drawer  full of snacks! Great!!!!
B0010DXYHW|5|Always have bought Fram products and never been disappointed.  Great protection at a fair price.
B00R5Y2F0W|5|The backseat organizer is a very nice size at  21.9 x 13.2 inches. It arrived in perfect condition and this is what it looks like straight out the box. The top shows a postcard that comes with the product that simply thanks you for purchasing the product and how to contact them if needed. It also talks about their special Amazon gift card promotion that they have going on for people that purchase this backseat organizer. It offers a chance to win a $50.00 Amazon giftcard.<br />Installation is a breeze with 2 adjustable straps that will fit securely where ever you are installing it in your car. It can be installed on the back of your seat or facing forward on the passenger seat as well. Secure it to suit your purposes. I wanted mine to organize things for my boys in the backseat so I secured it to the back of the drivers seat. First the smaller strap at the top goes around the headrest as seen in the photo I took.  Then the larger bottom strap secures it in place along the bottom of the seat. The strap adjusts for your particular seat. I didn’t have any problems securing this in my Toyota Sienna minivan. For my purposes this held 10 DVD videos and my boys sunglasses. This would be perfect for so many things though. Where I have their sunglasses it can easily hold sippy cups the top pocket can hold a container of wipes and diapers. You can put baby toys in pockets on the bottom or snacks for the road.<br />This would also work for holding your pets items on trip like collapsible dog water/food bowls, leashes, toys, etc.<br />What ever you need organized in your car this would fit the bill. As you can see with how it installs this can be used forward or backwards on the seats or I could have even installed it on the back of my third row seats for organization in the trunk area. There are just so many purposes it can be used for. I like everything secure and in it’s place. So there is less things unsecured in an accident and it just keeps things uncluttered and safe from getting stepped on or falling out of the door. I created a video: https://youtu.be/w6LJsHpFi0gfrom getting stepped on or falling out of the door. I created a video: https://youtu.be/w6LJsHpFi0g
B00B8T1150|3|The rings attached to the suction cups have bent and the bezel that holds the suction cups to the sunshade have ripped. One ripped off entirely.
B001DH8218|5|It fit my 2010 Impala perfectly. Basic, brief install instructions are included, but I found out that there are install instructions in my owner's manual also. Takes about 5 minutes to install.
B0098DCZ4E|5|It was just the right size, and it has stayed put pretty well. The product arrived rather quickly, as well.
B009VNK4AS|4|Love the quality. Just wish it folded/rolled up easier. A larger strap would be nice too. This fits my '14 F150 perfect. It really is a custom fit and does a fantastic job reflecting the sun in the Arizona desert when it's scorching outside.
B000KKLLFS|5|Works.
B001GC2LVM|5|I love these things! I've had mine for nearly two years now and have used them at least 15 times with my 33' Forest River Wildcat at different locations and environments. Leveling has never been so easy. With my properly mounted level on the front of my trailer, It's this simple: 1- position trailer where you want it, 2- place levelers in front of the tires that need elevated, 3- pull forward until level, and 4- place included chocks behind levelers and you're finished with horizontal leveling!  I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and after seeing the overwhelming amount of positive, as well as going to Andersen's website, I decided to purchase two sets for my dual axle trailer. I loved these the first time I used them and never looked back. I read all of the 1-3 star reviews and after using them, I feel completely positive that all the problems people had were user error in one way or another. There is a reason that RX companies have to place warnings to remove the foil that suppositories are sealed in before placement- people are stupid. I don't have some 20+ thousand pound 5th wheel trailer but mine fully loaded is pushing 10k lbs and not a bit of problem. The wheel chocks are not made to be driven over so the idiots that have &#34;blown theirs up&#34;, that's why. You don't place the levelers in front of your tires and back on them. You place them in front and pull forward on them. So the morons that backed on to them and then placed the chocks so they ended up in front of your tires and then drove over them (or backed up with the chocks in place), HELLO common sense here- BOOM! It's hard to believe that there are dual axles with tires closer than mine but for those that have them, if they are within what Andersen says will work, you're fine. If you have to cut the first 1-4&#34; off of one of them to fit between, it's well worth it. I didn't have to and my tires are pretty close together. You don't have to drive off of them either if you don't want to, just backup and then remove. Sometimes I drive off and sometimes I don't. I've occasionaly had the one get stuck in between after driving off of them and had to kick it out so I mainly just kick the chocks out and backup. It's obviously going to be a bit of a bump when doing so, not as bad as driving over a curb, but a bump nonetheless- which makes sense. So if you don't like it, don't do it. As for those that complained that it didn't raise their trailer enough, I've not been to an improved or full service campground yet that I had to level more than 4&#34;. I guess I'll be hosed if I run across one. As for unimproved campgrounds and non-campground camping, I always take boards, blocks, etc... just in case. This is one of, if not my favorite accessories I've purchased for my trailer. (Another one is X-chocks. They're great too but that's another review).
B000BUQODG|5|Exactly as described.  Good quality for the price
B00EVILBOQ|2|Bracket will not stay in position when going over 20mph no matter how tight it is adjusted.  It is robust but I'm constantly having to put it back up.
B00JLSYWWO|5|Item as expected.
B001UGJPXQ|5|Gave these as a gift to my sisters for their RV.  Works perfectly and keeps the RV steadier.
B00QXOCPMI|5|The quality of this product is great. It does fit quite well. It is sturdy and seems like it may last a very long time. I got it for a friend who was born in the year of the dragon and she says she likes it so I guess it's a good gift.
B002M496PC|5|Made my car look brand new again 😊
B001LQLTNE|5|Looks nice
B00AAR8JEM|5|Cool product!
B001JT570E|5|I bought this for my Son who drives a flat bed Semi. He said it makes rolling up the straps so much quicker.
B00AMH5UFQ|3|Used them in the cluser of my 96 saturn SL they worked great but the colour is way more purple then pink which is why they lost 2 stars . very bright and work great if you want purple
B000CP88UW|5|they loog great very good product
B000CAVLCE|5|It was a perfect fit
B001GF2PDI|4|Not quite &#34;like a glove&#34; fit, but relatively close. Not too bad though
B00K6BR4LG|5|Does the job it's suppose to! Because my winch cable is a 1/4 in I installed  a stainless steel fender washer  before the rubber stopper so the crimp would  not want to pull back into the stopper possibly shortening the life of the stomper.
B009FREAGO|5|My husband desperately needed this in his work truck.  It is leak proof, which is outstanding.  Very durable fabric.
B000UISKD6|4|So far pumps good. However part of housing is plastic and seems easily crack able
B001D5HP40|1|Blew an internal fuse immediately!  Returned for a full refund
B00TEHDXPO|5|Works well.
B00CWNVAPW|5|Works just as written and has great visibility day/night
B00H8DFKS4|3|The only leds that worked were the map light and puddle light replacements, dome light, tag light and reverse lights did not work.<br />Not sure why, defective parts or voltage problem.<br />The light from the map lights and puddle lamps is a big improvement over the stock bulbs.
B00BGZ2FAG|5|True to the colors in the picture. Great way to add flair to your keys.
B0021JRAPG|5|Great quality.  Highly recommend!
B003SYJEUC|5|Worked perfectly. Comes with a bulb already installed.
B00BUBSBYA|5|This product did come in several boxes. The instructions were spread out across multiple boxes. However, if people would organize them a little, it would be very easy to set everything up. It was my first time setting any roof rack on any car, and I was able to figure it out quickly. It also took me about an hour total to do the install on my Chevy Volt.  Super easy as along as you organize the instructions from all the boxes. Pre-read a little (10 minutes to do) and it will be a nice and quick job!
B0073Q48TI|4|Very impressed for the price! They don't move at high speed, and the convex lens creates a wider view. Only con is that they are so small so you can't see very far.
B0002NIM7I|3|Matches my stuff but too big still for my Prius.
B00KMWNVV6|4|nice sticker
B009349D4S|5|These are the exact replacements for my Shark helmet and fit according to original specs.
B003AT7I1C|5|The kit worked wonderfully with the CURT 16115 16K 5Th Wheel Unit. Smooth installation.
B00BCNB3EQ|5|Perfect.  No issues, easy to install, and I forget that they're an add-on.  Much easier to get the truck out of mud now.
B00BGZ042M|5|Great color. Was on point. These are great for when your remote is breaking and don't want to spend all the money for a new one. :)
B000AA4RWM|5|So far so good! Installed these onto camper by predrilling and filling holes with silicone caulk (to prevent leakage/mold), then attached with screws and silicone caulk on backs of the levels. After 1 month of use, no leaks, still true levels! Makes leveling camper so much easier!!!
B000CRO4IK|3|Coins get stuck too easily but it is okay...
B00L5LQGJM|5|Fast shipping. As described, perfect fit for the 2014 Sport
B00J9Q6690|5|Excellent
B000CKN55A|5|Perfect fit, exact replacement, was leary about online ordering.  All is good!
B00MQ1GGV8|4|Turns out that I had to re-order as this is the driver's side and I needed passenger side.  However, it's the same product essentially, so I am rating it as 4* as it does the job.  Easy to install, no issues.
B00N9V6TX4|5|Was exactly as advertised- came early and very easy to install.  I would absolutely recommend!
B0009VIQ1A|5|This works great on the outside of my truck! I was skeptical when I ordered this, but I have used it a few times and it is awesome! I actually wash my truck less because of this!  The first couple of times you use this, there will be red lint left on your car, but after that it goes away.
B00EMKBRMO|5|So cute!!! Love it!
B00AN5UEFS|5|Excellent price, fast delivery, quality product
B00YT1IAN0|5|Not much to say about this really. $5 is a bit much for a sticker I'd like to buy a box of them or maybe 3 for $5 but hey what can ya do huh. Oh yea if Hillary Clinton becomes president I'm moving to the South Pole
B00VNBDWPK|3|These bulbs are great but they have one big flaw. First and foremost the bulbs project perfectly. I wish they were 5000k instead of 6000k because there is a lot of unusable light that I worry will not fare well in rainy conditions. I would say they are brighter than the stock halogens and they project far in my case (with a non-projector lense) but like I said 6000k is not ideal for headlamps, 4500-500k would be much better. The quality of the bulbs are also outstanding, packaged nicely with the supplied hardware being very quality. Now the downfall with these bulbs is that Opt7 ultimately manufactures the same bulb for multiple applications and just puts an adapter on each bulb to get it to fit different bulbs types, which in my case was an H11. Everything in this setup is waterproof but it does have a fatal flaw. The H11 adapter just slides over the base of the bulb and is secured by 2 tiny phillips head screws. When secured the the headlight housing there is a significant amount of play. The h11 adapter is secure to the headlight housing but the bulb wiggles within the adapter. This causes an issue when the vehicle is driven over uneven payment because the bulb jiggles around and it noticed in the light beam. However this isn't the major issue, the major issue is the fact that this bulb base allows moisture inside you headlamp housing completely defeating the purpose of the gasket seal on the H11 adapter. Moisture and water can easily get around the adapter because the only thing clamping it on is 2 phillips head screws and because there is play, there is also gaps for water and moist air to enter the housing. Rather than returning the bulbs because I did decide to modify by taking the h11 adapter off the bulb itself by undoing the 2 phillips screws. It just slides right off. Then I took some spare weatherstrip adhesive I had laying around and put some around the base of the bottom of the bulb and slid the H11 adapter back onto the bulb. This created a seal to stop moisture from entering the housing and also secured the bulb so it did not move within the housing. So far so good but I have yet to see if the moisure seal will really work. I'm truly suprised that with all the technology they put into this bulb they would make an error this big. First and foremost they need to engineer a rubber sleeve to go in between the adapter and the bulb. With everything else being so water proof and water tight they completely overlooked this major issue.
B00BARKVS8|4|Tips look amazing, except for the welds, they look horrible.  I don't care much about them though as long as they hold up, they'll be covered in black after a while of use.
B001GJ3FIS|5|bought this as a replacement for a nozzle that I dropped and messed up. has a bunch of settings. they are all pretty useful. hopefully I don't break this one.
B0041MGDLI|5|This bearing fit the right-front (passenger side) of my 04 Pontiac Grand Am GT.<br /><br />This came with a new axle nut that was a different size socket than the stock nut. (cannot recall exact size 36mm, maybe?)<br /><br />After removing the old worn-out wheel bearing, the installation was easy.<br /><br />+++Would recommend
B0088R6FTW|4|I ordered a black decal, but got a white one. However, it was delivered quickly and is good quality.
B00APOFQYQ|3|Everything was there EXCEPT one of the two screws.
B00BJCHX8K|1|Very disappointed. After only 3 uses it started to &#34;shed&#34; and then the brush separated from the handle.
B003XWEO8Q|5|Exellent item
B0002SQZPY|1|Bolt snapped the first time I used it. Amazon sent me a refund
B000GD5FMY|5|Nice glasses
B00S0W656S|5|Great fit! Perfect replacement for a stock filter.
B005VMKW8W|5|I was looking for a shoe that would be convenient and comfortable while providing a measure of safety.  Something I could wear while riding on short trips and walk in.  I find it difficult to find m/c boots that fit comfortably as I have a wide foot.  I took a chance with these as reviews said they were roomier than other brands.  Normally I wear an 11.5 so ordered the 12.  Out of the box these fit great and we're comfortable although slightly stiff.  They broke in nicely and I find them very comfortable, more like a tennis shoe than a boot.  They don't provide the full protection of a boot but are a good compromise when ease and comfort are important.  I would definitely buy again.
B009O4RT0W|5|Great product!!
B00829I25Q|5|Great alternative over the dealership. My local Toyota dealer wanted 496.00 installed. It's only a 1 hour job on a lift so I guess that means they charge close to $350 for the pump. Glad I looked on Amazon first!
B00BCRM9RM|5|I love them.
B00FAIBCJK|1|Attention attention!!!!Buyers beware this license plate is a false advertisement the frame is a cheap black paint and the letterings is a tape.Amazon should discontinue this type of appetite and is false don't waste your money on this seller.It deserves no stars!!!!!
B00KO3PHLA|5|Really good harnesses for the money. I thought they'd be crap and break within the first month and I'd have to go buy another more expensive set. But I've had them for two months now using them through rough trails and some intense off roading and they are just wonderful. 10/10 would recommend
B00ZZO01Z0|5|Worked as good as the more expensive ones
B00O2CXARC|5|LOOKS GREAT
B00180FWEU|1|Installed on 2009 ford escape hybrid. Nice big link with a grease fitting.<br /><br />The Bad: Bumps into the front brake line support bracket at full turn. May work most of the time, but i do not want it touching anything doing with the brakes.  Moog is about 37mm thick compared to Ford at 31 mm thick. See photos of installed strut.
B000CF6RX2|5|Easy to install.
B006GFLI0O|5|This works as expected.
B00KH5FY22|4|I like it, it's pretty bright. The thing i really dont like bout it is it doesnt remember your last flash pattern Other than that its a good light for the price
B003EP3ACS|5|works wonders! Car lovers should get this. It really protects the edge of the car.
B00HZW3RYM|2|Very thin stock that tore when I removed it from the backing.
B00PTTGLR8|5|I have had this for a couple of months now and still looks new. This is installed on the back of my car and doesn't see as much flying debris or dirt as the plain silver one I have on the front. As far as I can tell this is truly laser engraved, and haven't had any issues with degradation of the shine or lettering. I would recommend this if you want an extra touch to your accord, even though the font isn't exactly the same as my 2013+ Accord.
B0031I2SKS|5|Fit perfect on my Silverado. Better price than in stores. Thanks.
B00L843FP4|5|Very nice for my Ford Escape 2011
B00GSAUHB8|5|Actually fits the windshield. Great product--very durable.&#34;
B007S2V4CG|5|a - ok
B00JW1VXTK|5|The product work wonderful
B00JDTVJVS|3|Arrived quickly and in good condition.  Unfortunately it doesn't have very good reception.  The Original antenna on my Tacoma was far superior and is back on the truck.
B00GKRQ7DG|5|Absolutely love this decal! My husband purchased it for me and put it onto my pink 3DS. It is really quite cute on there, although after the 1+ year I've had my 3DS for, I'd say this decal has gone the distance.
B005WWNQOS|5|Perfect fit & function. Pretty good price, too. Who could ask for more?
B00EB07L0W|5|Very nice. I should have bought more
B00LD1F3UC|2|After installed, parts of the honeycomb came loose and rattled inside the exhaust. The loose parts were stopped by the 2nd convertor. Had to disconnect  and take out broken parts.
B0043063JU|4|Very good transaction.  Exactly as viewed.
B001EP0GOK|5|Purchased this after extensive resaerch on which receiver would fit our 2014 Chevy Traverse LT.  Found this to be the easiest application since it was manufactured to fit our specific vehicle.  Came with detailed instructions.  I suggest also looking at installation video on manufacture site and YouTube. Both were very helpful.  I recommend this product to anyone wanting to add towing capabilities at a much lower price than dealer offered
B00NLMDNH6|5|Great cover for my wife's car and she loves it.
B00UW4DLJ6|1|Sparks flew out of the charging port the first time I used it!!!!
B00IYGVD4O|4|Quality appears good, looks nice.  Shipped sooner then expected.
B007WQQNQA|5|This is one of the best product for the best price one can buy
B000AL8VD2|4|Worked great.
B00480N18G|5|great, bright beam. Well focused, direct replacement for the fog lights on my Toyota. Very bright, long lasting.
B00JQY1ZJ6|1|It was junk I threw it in the trash after resetting it 15 times
B0000AZ768|5|Have used these many times and they save me the expense of buying a new pump.
B00JSRVX48|5|Originally meant for 300zx(z32), but running this on my '91 240sx (KA24DE engine).<br />Easy upgrade and fits in the stock 240 fuel filter bracket, it's a little tight, but it fits.<br />Hoses can be a little difficult to take off when old. I would recommend just replacing the fuel line hoses while you're at it since those are most likely pretty old too.<br /><br />Definitely something worth changing if you're having fuel starvation issues.
B000BLNTQU|5|Great!!!
B0024E6HRU|5|Fits snugly and protects the spare!
B00LW6OBOM|4|Excellent look and feel. Installation was easy my only small dislike was the exposed back portion of the rear seat cover.
B0009JKGJC|5|Love this stuff
B00TK2Y5QE|1|This is the biggest piece of crap I have ever purchased if I could give it no stars I would. Shipping was slow, dimensions were wrong and it's not a decal as advertised it's a flimsy wall cling that wouldn't even lay flat due to design issues don't buy this garbage
B009TC50LE|5|As advertised
B008S302Y0|5|Does it necessarily need to be keyless?
B00KTIAZLC|5|Very easy to program. Did three at one time  had a few months. Working great  for 2007 silverado
B00XZ9P11G|5|Works as expected
B009W3PU06|5|Replaced the stock air filter on a '15 Ultra Limited. It looks great and I don't have any issues with my leg touching it while riding. Really easy to install.
B00OVZZ4QA|1|Horrible adhesive. Peals away even as you apply it. By the time you reach the bottom it peals from the top.
B00YBZEJ70|5|The spacers were just what I needed and fit perfectly!
B00F7GXNX8|4|not bad just not as green as I would like but still good.
B00FSC3E12|5|Arrived soon and worked as designed!
B010VUZL0M|5|Wonderful product. Very happy with quality and very fast shipping.
B000KXA6HY|1|The product could not provide suction well enough - perhaps because of the surface, but it didn't do the trick for what we needed (minor car dent).
B004ZF39ZY|5|I've had them in for about a month now and I bought the anti-Flickr things with them and I installed them myself the only thing that sucked was for my car I had to take off the wheels and get under the wheel well that's about it
B00L4I9Q8O|5|Great
B0022XDCXA|5|Always impressed by PSR. Straightforward, quality, badass sticker included :P<br />Note: on zx-6r 08' exhaust needs to be taken off for removal of stock link on brake side. Install thru bolts opposite of removal to make any future adjustments much, much easier.
B00EJA3BU8|4|Good Quality, easy to install and matched perfectly.
B00YA0MG4E|2|Low quality led bulbs.  Installed them in my 2014 chevy malibu with the stock projector housings (non hid), they ended up being much dimmer then the stock halogens.  I only had them turned on for 5-10 minutes and they heated up far too much for me to put the back headlight covers over these.  If you want the color, without halogen brightness, and you have space for the heat sink to get a good amount of air, get these. Otherwise, personally I'm going back to halogen.
B002SAR4UY|3|I bit small in the vertical direction but there is not a great amount of things that can be done vertically.
B00LMGORXC|5|verry good..
B005NLQAHS|4|Bluetooth connection can lag at times but overall good product
B0002KR88A|1|Works as expected
B007LICL56|1|The bolts are to short to put through the license plate.  I guess better luck next time.
B00CBTRMZ4|5|This is awesome.  No thinking , just plug and play. It would be nice to have more &#34; Geniuses&#34; out there , if you know what I mean.  Truly is a great addition to our boat. Don't have to worry much about the battery's going dead. We'll just a little.  You won't regret purchasing it.
B008OEQ6WU|5|I made a boot out of a piece of 1.75&#34; radiator hose that had a curve in it. And connected the filter to it with a piece of 1.75&#34; conduit, it works great.
B007RVC0MG|5|Nice
B000A0EJ9I|5|Filter fit as it should.
B0002SQU9K|3|work just fine
B00PT18QAQ|5|In a word: wonderful!!!! It is what I was expecting it to be, accurate.
B009DK7CR2|5|Fit perfectly on my 2019 Saturn Outlook!  Not sure how I lost the first one but this one looks like the original.
B0006IX7YC|5|I had the problem of the black water tank sensor always showing the tank as half full, even after completely draining it.  After using this gadget just two times, the sensor is now displaying accurately.  I highly recommend this product, as it's paid for itself already.  I didn't experience any of the leakage problems around the valve that others have reported, so no issues there.
B00EO1F9I4|5|Everything was plug and play. Noticed a difference off the line and on the top end.
B001BCF5R4|4|Looks great. I bought it for my Toyota Corolla along the matching break and acceleration. Only problem is that it doesn't cover the whole foot rest, but it still looks great with the whole set. Love it!
B009XIIFWK|3|The windshield looks good but did not improve the buffeting I experienced with the stock shield. The &#34;Flair&#34;windshield is substantially thinner than the victory OEM, it comes with extra rubber washers to help account for the thinner material.  I don't think it is good value for the money, for the premium cost the fit should be perfect.  Had I known I would have spent half as much on a non-brand name solution or gone to a taller Victory branded screen.
B00EVH5SV4|5|Ok
B00UO4E8LE|4|Good quality seat covers at an affordable price.
B000QHV1C8|5|Delivered as promised and working great.
B000C7WXB0|5|Fixed my erradic wind shield wipers. They would not work on any low setting and would not park. They only worked on high settings as well as the wiper fluid function. Only wish I would have found this sooner. Had both of the wiper motors replaced 3 months ago and it did not nothing.
B00WA1U7MS|5|I keep it handy in the center console beside me. I love that it's a vehicle safety, security, and rescue tool all in one. Good quality and easy to use. Lightweight, compact, and accurate too! Very nice!! Kudos to the shipper - we received it within a couple of days of the order. All around great buy!
B000E4SMR0|5|Just like OEM. Great fit And construction. Seems better made than the original.
B003YNWBH0|5|These in-cabin filters fit perfectly in my 2007 Nissan Pathfinder. They seem durable and did not bend or tear when put in place. The odor coming out of the vents is now gone. Will definitely purchase these when it's time to replace.
B0087NB1IW|4|Works well on my HJC helmit. Cords have enough length to route under padding. I like the mount options. Only complaint is sometimes there is static. Battery life is good. I haven't ridden in any rain but the connector is waterproof. It charges with my HJC phone charger
B00B9FCYX6|5|Good quality and fits beautifully.  I'm very pleased.
B0040D2P4M|5|They work like they're supposed to. Ford makes cheap connectors and have had to replace at least a dozen so far, and because of that, these connectors may not snap in place but fit snug enough to stay in place
B001TIV1KA|4|Cleaned tanks very good. Will buy again if need
B009Y7EE9I|1|Where do these four clear pieces go
B004TYU8F0|5|best thing ive ever bought. I wanted to give it a shot on performance and WOW it delivered on power and cold starts. It will drop your jaw if it does what it did for me.
B00BDVHSIC|5|Prefect replacement Oil cap for my 1989 BMW 325ic convertible, it looks the same as factory original, comes with the rubber seal too.
B00PT18QAQ|5|love it, both in quality & ease of use. Thank you so much.<br />With a world of junk & low quality items & parts around us, I'm happy with this purchase. I use it for family cars & it seems to work for me for a long time. I'm not a tire pro, but it might even be used as heavy duty like commercial use.<br />thanks for making this gauge available & affordable!
B00C8UEYSO|5|These are great upgrades.
B00GJKXW8M|2|One of the 2 lamps is down to 2 led's out of 6 after 6 mo. I haven't contacted the seller to resolve the issue yet, but be aware
B005N53CBQ|2|Fantastic delivery time.  However, the product was very inferior.  Straps broke instantly, fit was poor at best.  Perhaps just a poor choice on my part?  Eventually threw it out.
B0009IBJAS|5|great little trickle charger for jet skis. saved our batterys thru the winter and good value over the big box and auto parts stores
B0038KNJQ6|4|works wonderful very pleased thank ypu
B00EAOIHR0|5|Works perfectly for my vehicle and keeps the interior free of most smells and odors from outside. Great product that was easy to install with some help from youtube. I couldn't be happier!
B011M9YMP6|5|It is much better than i thought it would be for the price, no joke high strength...
B00042K37O|4|Fit perfectly, although it should have included all bolts and springs.  It only has what is in the picture.  As well the instructions left much to be desired.
B000GZMZTS|4|Front end now rides a tad higher and tracks nicely. Good for anyone who rides aggressively and is over 150lbs.
B00LMGG6PY|3|The kit seems good, but the chrome is rather scratched and dented especially the levers.
B000A8OVHU|5|came as described. best spark plugs for a honda. dont waste your money on iridium's or platnums.
B01191O5UO|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B001JT1D5C|5|Great product at a great price. And shipped ontime.
B0085IJNNY|5|This pair of stabilizers work as advertised.  So far I am well pleased with their use.
B000YJDC5C|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B000GUYPQE|5|Dampening is 110% better with these. Easy installation. Mine required some drilling of the stock dampening rod.
B009WEA2H6|5|It arrived fast and it was very easy to install the brake light(plug and play) and to integrate the turn signals, simply splice into the positives on both sides and connect the blue and yellow wire independently to them. Quick and easy.
B003RQBKLC|5|It is easy to use and it works for my business and all the electronics that we need to charge through the day.
B0064FXRWI|5|Used these for my fog lights.  They look great but don't know if the provide any significant different other then the color of the fogs.  Have yet to use these fog lights through the proper conditions.
B00KQ81M94|5|I got a chance to use the Man Sham and all I have to say is WOW!  I was able to dry my whole Jeep with just wringing it dry three times plus just one pass over a section and wham it was dry!<br /><br />I will highly recommend this to family and friends!
B004DSA2Z8|1|Poor quality , first time use and not even work ! Not Fitting right, hose gaskets not right , completely disappointed !  Don't buy
B002Q5OK9O|5|very nice , big size was espected!
B002DZJQ0A|5|They worked like a charm. Used them for my Easy Pass and radar device. Highly recommend them.
B00X7HS5LY|2|The height measurement of this product isnt accurate they say its 35 its not its 33. Also The important measurement you wanna look for is the support wire diameter but this is not info that's easily seen on the first page. My windshield is 32&#34;tall and the jumbo II will not even come close to fitting. the support wire in this model is only 27 a full 5 to 6 inches too short
B005FKZUR8|5|Wow what a difference over stock pads and rotors.  Put these on just before heading out on a 10000 km cross country journey to California and back from Ontario Canada and they performed amazing.  Fade free, quiet and strong stopping power on my 2003 Trailblazer EXT LT even when loaded with 6 passengers, luggage, Thule Rooftop carrier and a Hitch carrier.  I would highly recommend.
B00DNNIHCY|5|Fit perfectly, I would definitely recommend this cover.
B00CX7L1LA|4|Did the job
B0041MVQ4M|5|Best pads and price on the market.
B009FOGJDE|5|Much better than the OEM one
B00I0SE0FK|5|Nice upgrade of what I had before. Worth the money, make sure you measure your head before buying
B007QBQY1U|4|On time, as advertised, looks good. Haven't installed it, so I can't comment on its performance...
B00DX8BYIS|5|Love this bubble shield.  Have it paired with an all white open face helmet, great old school look.  Easy install.  Tinting is enough for sunny days but not too much for night time riding.
B00C890628|4|I actually bought this helmet for a short film I was making, so I can't speak to the practical functionality of the helmet. What I can say, however, is that it is the coolest looking motorcycle helmet I have ever seen. And what's more: it's very affordable. My only gripe is that the screws that hold the visor in place are plastic and strip very easily, so be very careful if you intend on either removing the visor or replacing it.
B003XGYDE2|3|three black accessories are not in package very disappointed but the pump works very well
B00S4CPL5U|5|These LED lights are great. Their warm light are a perfect replacement for halogen lighting. I have replaced both halogen & (the awful) neon lights in our motorhome and couldn't be more satisfied with the results. Simply drill a 2 1/8” hole and they fit perfectly. I have some of them on an LED dimmer and they work fine. Love'em!
B007VRE3QW|5|Oil pan gasket is of good quality, have some leaking issues but that could of being my fault.
B00XJGTWHO|5|Love this steering wheel cover. Material is very soft and it fit on my KIA like a glove. Love it!!!
B00BITJS0A|4|fits as it should
B00514ARJE|5|Nice quality. Brake light is bright and noticeable in non-DOT mode. Works great with Kuryakyn led turn signals.<br />The only one thing to mentioning: stock load equalized doesn't support 4 way flashers (may overheat), so it's better to order Kuryakyn low-heat regulated - it's also alarm compatible.
B0016KFXZU|5|Very good reflectivity and visibility at night.
B004J0T4YU|4|So far it's holding up just fine. A real money saver. Came in a brown box by it self.  Poped right in. Would recommend. Will update on the length of its service if and when it cracks.
B004K296N6|5|used it many times, so far I have been able to pump up all 4 tires of 3 jeeps with this. very good compressor
B003C7URYC|1|Overheated the first day
B000JFHNEC|5|perfect
B0040CYSKC|5|Great clamps, high quality, good value
B0055XHBOA|5|very comfortable a lot better then the original mattress.
B00O9VFLRS|5|same thing...stabilization.
B000NOKNKA|4|I don't really like the foam around the lense area...
B004BH8H3A|5|Fast shipping and exactly as described. Customer was very happy.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|OEM Lexus fit and quality.

B00KQXKG46|5|Easy to install  Simply used my old mounts from my KC HiLites attached to my grill guard.  Light is much brighter that I thought it would be.
B004A6OI12|5|Works good sc430
B002P8CN8M|5|Part was EXACTLY as advertised. High quality, good price, well packaged and arrived quickly. Installation was simple. Only wish I had known about this a couple months ago and I wouldn't have been driving around with a broken mirror all that time!!!!
B0041TM0GS|5|Second time I've had to order this part (two different cars). Does what it's supposed to do and was delivered to me with no problem
B004RCSLFS|5|I actually received the pump the next day. I guess you might call that quick service. I have read posts that say the pumps are noisy, I don't think so. Come on guys these go into RVS and boats, we &#34;ain't&#34; home and if you can't cut a little noise you don't need to have an RV. Good pump, works as it should. Ask me again in a year or so.
B0078F3NXG|5|Very sturdy and strong, has been run over twice by Class 8 garbage trucks and only broken part is 2 wheels.
B0076QWMIO|3|Difficult to install.... one hole did not line up exactly but it was too tight to remove.
B010Q07T6Q|5|I am a member of a local Jeep club and we often go on rides which go after dark. When my husband and I first started looking into a light bar for our Jeep the guys in the club told us we would regret buying anything other than a well-known brand such as Smittybilt or Rugged Ridge.  They claimed most of the cheaper light bars on Amazon do not have a strong direct beam of light, and the light is too scattered to make a noticeable difference. Since I really didn’t want to pay $300+ for a light bar I decided to give this one a try anyways. As you can see from my pictures, this light bar is very bright and does have a strong beam. So far, I haven’t noticed it getting really hot while using. I’m extremely happy with my purchase so far.<br /><br />I didn’t really like the mount that came with this light bar and ended up buying a different one. The mount is meant to be universal, which basically means you will need to drill into the body of your car to install it. I’m not thrilled with the idea of drilling into my car so I decided to buy a mount which is specifically designed for my model of Jeep. The light seems to be compatible with most mounts so I didn’t have any issues finding one.<br /><br />The install was really easy; the hardest part was the wiring. You will need to buy the wiring separately. I bought a kit off of Amazon, and didn’t have too much trouble installing it. Again, it was super easy to find one that was compatible.<br /><br />My car is quite a bit noisier while driving on the highway because it is less aerodynamic. I didn’t think it would make that much of a difference, but I feel like the light bar contributes to more noise than my 35” tires. Buts it’s just something I have learned to live with…Jeeps have never been known to be practical.<br /><br />Overall this is a great light bar for someone who isn’t looking to spend big bucks just to have a fancy brand name. I don’t notice any difference between this one and the more expensive ones on my friend’s Jeeps.<br /><br />***I received this for a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.***
B00NMV2N22|5|Although I ordered the wrong color, the product was as described.

B00122EENE|5|Worked perfectly in my 2005 Honda civic ex.  Check engine light gone.
B001LA18UO|5|Terrific!
B003BZD08U|5|Be it crass or plastic this is a must for every RVer out there.  I could have bought one with a gauge on it but that is something that could break easily enough.  A simple regulator like this that is nicely priced is all that is needed.  Regular camping sites charge much more for this guy.
B005ZZOE6Q|5|good
B007V2E8XA|5|Fits my Toyota Venza perfectly. Folds and unfolds in a snap unlike many others I have tried
B00Y8TLO72|5|Good quality....nice print.  Exactly what you'd expect.
B00SZ71HDY|5|The runningboards they are awesome very easy to install but the instructions that come with the runningboards leave you wondering I'm going to post this link to YouTube it's a guy installing them on the Ram crew pick up makes it a whole lot easier when you see it in a video  thanks again great deal quality product
B00MIZTAK6|4|Exactly as it is described. Seems sturdy
B008I1WCA4|4|Installed easily fits great...
B00JIBFMY6|5|Very well made. Put in car right away. Just never know when you will need it? Hopefully never! But...better to be prepared! Purchased thru promotion for evaluation
B00KY0G3DO|1|I purchased one of these for my 2003 Ford Windstar about 3 weeks ago. The first one I got was damaged, the outside shipping and inside boxes were ok with no dents. The battery post was bent and cracked and the housing for the computer connection was cracked. I decided to put it on anyway. Went on with no hitches, holes lined up and connectors fit. Started it up and checked voltages, everything seemed ok. I went for a test drive. I got about 3/4 of a mile down the road and the car just shuts off, no warning, no check engine light, just cuts off. Tried to start it and it cranked over like it wanted to start but didn't, until I turned the key off and back on. After having it do that several more times I went back home, checked voltages again and everything checked out fine. Ran ok just at idle for 10-15 minutes. Took it back out, same thing, it would just cut off. All of the symptoms seemed to point to a fuel issue( fuel pressure was under the low recommended spec), so being as the van has 220,000 miles on it I ordered a fuel pump. However before I got the new pump or installed it, I put the old alternator back on( the reason I wanted to replace, it was starting to whine quite a bit like the bearings were getting ready to fail and voltages were on the low side or normal), and the van ran fine, I took it around the block, then eventually a 20 mile round trip. So I figured the external damage on the new one must have knocked something loose inside the old one.<br /><br />So I get a replacement. It arrives in undamaged condition. I put it in the vehicle, same problem of cutting off on acceleration. I sent an email to the company and here is the reply I got 3 days later:<br /><br />&#34;Good morning Tim,<br /><br />Sorry for the delay, I am looking into this to see if there was an issue or not.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Sherry Packer&#34;<br /><br />I have not heard anything more from them. So I returned the second one and ordered [[ASIN:B007Y882N8 DB Electrical AFD0060 Alternator (For Ford Windstar 3.8L 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 135 Amp Afd0060)]] , It arrived over the weekend and I put it on today. Drove around the block and several miles with no issues. So I cannot recommend this product to anyone. I also find it humorous that the price has gone up $40 since I received the first one.
B00C80HL98|4|Small. However bright for it's size.
B00KTJAZ7U|5|It was a great deal for the money,very easy to install took me about 10 minutes. works great we're happy with it.
B013CFC8YU|4|Sound is good, but not great. In-call could be better sound and volume. Comfortable fit. Charges relatively quick. Low volume for person receiving my call. Overall, 4 stars.
B0000AY4MK|5|Fit perfectly and was very easy to install on my 2004 Ram 1500. I am very happy with the item and would not hesitate to recommend.
B00LM03YD2|5|This replacement filter does the job and for a great price.
B002E4ZR94|2|prime is great to have I`d place an order Friday product was at my door Monday super fast, But item was damaged causing me an all new set back !!!!!....... My car at the shop taking apart now waiting again . http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51y2OFNX6YL._SL1500_.jpg top part broking .
B000F3RYGA|3|Key broke upon 1st use.
B005PD9TS6|5|I LOVE IT .,,,THANKS SO MUCH
B006VYFHBQ|4|I'm glad I could order this online instead of tramping through a junkyard, hoping to find one. It fits perfectly, buy as many have mentioned, you need  to either remove the metal insert ( a pair of tweezers work best) or, remove the insert that was most likely left on your stereo when the last knob was removed. The inserts tend to stay behind I think. So, glad to have it, hated paying $23 for a piece of plastic.
B00DIGEKUE|5|Old ignition switch was kind of touchy. Put this one in and... BAM!!!!!!!. Easy to install. Starts like a new one. Happy Happy Happy
B00FSG8224|4|Needs to come in a warm color.  White is almost too bright for the one area I am using them in.
B000643VQU|5|These are great gauges.  I have (2) of them.  High quality and accurate.
B0009IQXMC|5|no complaint
B000C8NTXA|5|Great kit, works great.
B0009VGP0E|5|Excellent front of hood protection!  Last one lasted 8 years!
B009WDSJDG|5|I've used this twice to drain my fuel tank.  Much easier and cleaner than disconnecting the crossover line or using a transfer pump.  It's convenient enough to put in a saddlebag for a trip.
B000C1Q6BE|5|I believe that these are as good as, or better than the Honda parts.
B00NMP5WAI|4|Good part but the metal clips are not as good as OEM. Re-use OEM chips if you can.
B001DCGUJE|5|great
B00DQJ8T00|4|The antenna did great and caths all local stations but im taking 1 star away because the black faded almost to a copper look from the sun beating on it all day. I took it off and spray painted it back and its good but i didnt expect it to fade in only 2 months.
B000PEZBO6|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00KDJNRDA|5|This got my other 1100 v star Classic back on the road.
B000C7XU4E|5|I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ. This piece is identical the factory Mopar unit it replaced. Even has the Chrysler logo as others have mentioned.<br /><br />Not only did this fit perfectly, it fixed my problem where the remote door locks wouldn't work. The horn would beep but the locks wouldn't lock/unlock.<br /><br />My passenger windows would also only work intermittently before replacing with this unit.<br /><br />The entire project took me about 20 minutes.<br /><br />Here is an awesome link with a handy how to write up.<br />http://www.4wdmechanix.com/How-to-Jeep-Cherokee-Power-Window-and-Door-Lock-Switch-Replacement.html
B008UO1QYW|4|Fits very small but great design and product materials.
B0007OWD2M|5|Invisible Glass is by far the best glass cleaning product I have ever used.  Much better than Windex.  Does not leave streaks and it sticks where you spray it instead of running off. I have used this product for 5 years and and don't use anything else.
B0084LT9YU|5|They seem pretty solid and installed easily.  Maybe 5 minutes each to make sure they were lined up correctly.
B008HU269S|3|print should be on both sides.
B00A7WIVNE|5|Fits my 2015 jk Willie's perfect ! Makes my cab look clean and well thought out for all the lighting l have. Cons. Be careful cutting out the switch holes. I used a dremel it worked great. Thanks for such a great product!
B002C7DSIK|5|Great!!!
B0054RW1HE|5|I've had these mirrors on my 2015 Jeep Willys for about a month.  The quality of the mirrors is very good.  All the pieces I needed were included, even had a few extra torx bolts.  Some reviewers complained about a whistling sound caused by the mirrors but the whistling I heard was only occasional and very slight.  I don't really notice it now.  Plus, with the doors and top are off anyway there are plenty of other wind noises.  The mirrors were very easy to install, almost self-explanatory.  Depending on how the mirrors are adjusted they extend from the Jeep's body 6 to 12 inches which gives sufficient distance for excellent visibility which is further aided by the healthy 6 inch diameter of the actual mirrors.  The visibility with these mirrors is better than the factory installed mirrors.  I removed the passenger side mirror because the driver side mirror plus the interior rear view mirror are more than adequate.  I have no complaints about these mirrors after a month of use.
B006RJPDUK|5|Attention grabbing and stay stuck to my front door.  Does the job well.
B001OBCKYI|5|They seem to be as good as the ones from Isuzu, so I am happy.
B005HR1K46|4|It fits the handle bar and holds the GPS mount.
B000QIVQGS|5|Works well
B006QH561E|5|Great Battery. No compaints
B000E28C7M|5|Wow, another excellent product that Harley should have done from the factory.  Put a little oil on the gasket before tightening (finger tight ONLY), and this filter backs right off when time for an oil change.<br />For best results, do it yourself.  Most monkeys at the Stealership crank them down too tight and do not oil the gasket first.
B00E9W2PPS|5|work's great & great product
B009G5ERVS|5|Works great and shipping was extremely fast.
B002N5RZOY|5|Easy installation and works great.
B000IYR5U6|5|Perfect Fit. Great Price.
B005XUIX24|5|its the best penetrating oil I have ever used
B00J4PDOSC|5|just installed, seem to have great braking response. break-in instructions were very easy to follow.<br />so far all is well. my decision to buy was price, and they seem to be a great value for normal street use.<br />the black paint treatment looks sharp, hope its heat tolerant and lasts.
B007XUIPCA|5|It worked really well on 2002 honda accord ex v6!
B00PYCXGQE|5|Perfect for the Meguiar's DA
B003YMX0Y4|5|Still stopping strong after a couple thousand miles of usage. Noticeably quiter and smoother braking than oem brakes as it should be.
B00O10FFNM|4|Excellent
B00460IVBU|5|VERY USER FRIENDY
B00M8JU2SQ|5|Looks great, feels confortable!  Great seller!
B00HSTX274|4|Looks great on my car. I'm not sure yet how well it will hold up in the Arizona sun but it's nice enough that I'd probably replace it should it wear.
B000BR51L0|5|Finally got around to installing this on my 350 tbi at the start of summer, and I have to say i'm fairly impressed with this kit, It was very easy to instal into my truck, and it was actually harder to take out the old air filter system then put this on . I was very skeptical about any kind of mpg gain, but I was very surprised to see on average a gain of 1 mpg on my daily commute. I also have noticed a slight gain in horsepower especially low end but nothing huge. However be forewarned this makes the truck sound much more aggressive when you press down on the pedal, you'll probably burn through some gas due to wanting to hear you engine roar to life.
B00E1L72RS|3|Clips come of very easy, super easy to lose.
B00SMJ1SBQ|1|JUST CHEAP PLASTIC, SHOULD BE WORTH $2.
B009PDC704|5|Works great, easy to program
B001GN6RXO|5|EXACT Fit, not problems. Super Buy.
B005HVG4GQ|4|This tester is easy to use, I checked the brake fluid in my wifes car and the fluid in mine against new brake fluid as a master standard. The results were my wifes brake fluid was OK and mine had to be changed, this confirmed that brake fluid should be changed every 2 years.
B001I93KU4|5|grandson says it is geat
B000N9XK1Y|5|Another great intake by K&N, makes a killer sound under the hood when standing on the gas pedal and makes my FJ accelerate like a scolded dog. I don't mind that it's not a true cold air intake because it looks and sounds so damn good. Word to the wise though, don't solely rely on the step by step instructions. They are not the most detailed and chances are you will get confused rather quickly. Follow the parts breakdown illustration Instead and that will answer all of your hardware related questions. Very satisfied with my purchase, K&N delivers great products and horsepower.
B00DQET6UW|5|very nice LED
B000C8R9O0|5|perfect no leaks. Use the new filter bolt. throw out old bolt and spacer.
B00D1CQVIY|5|easy install, and works great so far. only had it on for a couple days and have been pleased so far! Great buy if it stays working good!
B001TNMWBM|1|Ordered non-gloss clear coat, received clear gloss.<br /><br />Apparently it is impossible to buy the non-clear-gloss version.<br /><br />So you're screwed if you're looking for the flat/satin finish.
B00X7Y9B9M|4|I'm reviewing the Intro-Tech Custom Fit Premium Folding Auto Sun Shade (Good) version. Purchased for a 2012 Nissan Quest minivan and I'm happy with the fit.. I purchased a &#34;universal&#34; sun shade from a big box retail stores, but found this didn't fit very well considering the minivan windshield is so huge. This custom fit shade fits almost perfectly in the shape of the windshield, it practically rests against the glass. I like the ease of placing the shade; unfold, slide the bottom place, push up the top part, and drop the visors to hold. No sagging or falling out of place. However, a couple drawbacks... this shade is rigid. When it's folded, it is still rather thick and hard to find a spot in the car to tuck it away when not in use. Another drawback, ultimately led me to drop a star, is the cut out for the rear-view mirror is pretty big (attached a pic), this allow quite a bit of sun light through (unlike the stock photo where it looks like the entire windshield is covered). Overall, I like it. About 2-3 times the price of the &#34;universal&#34; fit, but considering the large size of the Quest's windshield, if you really want to block out as much light as possible and protect your dash, and no hassle setup, this shade *fits* the bill! Feel free to comment or ask questions, I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner.
B0002Q81W6|5|Makes the finished job looks good, fits the connector so you don't need to attach anything extra. Was easy to put on my plastic bumper.
B002HVJ7H2|1|didn't fit the tranny shaft. tolerances too small. Tried grease and hitting it with rubber mallet- nothing worked. The OEM aftermarket brand fit much better.
B000WKHXS0|5|Although they did not fit my helmet, they were perfect for my wife's. Missed on mind but a Bulls Eye for my wife!
B010GJF8N8|5|My order and shipping for the socket adapter set went very quickly and smoothly. Upon receiving the product I immediately noticed how heavy duty they were. It's very easy to remove the sockets from the adapters and they work well with the air tools I've tried them with. So far so good! I would definitely recommend these to anyone in the automotive field or anyone just using them to take care of personal projects.
B00GHNHCXC|5|Fits perfect, shield came just as described.
B001005TX2|5|Accidentally got 2 of these, but oh well, you can never have too much glue.
B000N3CP7A|5|perfect fit
B00B2YHFO2|5|These lights are very bright and bring a modern clean touch to any vehicle.  Practical for family cars in search of missing items at night.  ❤
B000HS6MZW|5|Works Great
B00MMLIXPO|4|Works good, does not have a lot of distance.
B00DP2UYE2|3|Better then the tube tires but it only lasted 3 weeks and it was worn through, for the price i expected this to last much longer.
B009M64CUM|5|The best oil for older cars with flat tappet cams!
B00L4TF32G|5|My husband swears by this stuff. He uses it in the RV, the cars, and even coats our kayaks with it. He absolutely loves this product! We are purchasing more for our boys to use on their cars and boats.
B009PW58E2|5|fit perfectly
B00QMNW7H8|5|fit perfectly thanks
B0009PSA4O|4|Exactly what I wanted for my new boat
B009O0AV4M|1|Front did not fit my 2012 !! :'(
B001V8U12M|3|It is a little tight and wants to stick to the jack's nut.
B00FW1JTB8|3|This was a returned item, i ordered the wrong ones, but i'm sure it's a great item
B00EEG8P4O|4|Couldn't beat for the price
B004C444NE|1|Item is not sized correctly. I have large hands, so I ordered size XXXL, however these fit like a large.
B0002YQSRS|5|makes it easy to change filter
B0000AY4YT|5|It worked great and my slide is like new.
B003ADGENQ|3|Decent product but I ruined the 1st one trying to figure out how to apply it.<br />There were NO directions in the package. Just 2 vinyl patches.<br />Though I eventually figured it out, it was not before I tore the 1st patch. Forcing me to only having the Kanji on 1 side of the helmet.
B00SIGN7O4|5|Fits my 2012 Tundra perfectly and works with the controls. You can't tell it from a OEM Toyota mirror.
B005NLQAHS|4|Works very well.  I like it.  The only thing is it's a bit too long.
B003POEOQ4|5|cleans my car very well.  I apply it to the car dry to remove dust and it works perfect.
B009SF0FWQ|3|kinda small
B007JIDKEO|5|Thank you! Works and fits perfectly!
B00PC0G07A|5|I was surprised by the quality of the leather.  It is very soft and plush with a thick foam feel to it.  The leather is grippy and not smooth which is what I prefer.<br /><br />It did not come with directions but YouTube videos  will give you more than enough help.  I just took my time and tried a couple sewing patterns to see what I liked better.  It will stretch a lot.  So do not be worried your car's steering wheel is too big.  Unless you have a huge steering wheel off a big rig or something you know for a fact is odd, this really is universal.  It fit my 2012 Honda Accord coupe perfectly.  I have the wider thumb rests and it was able to stretch to cover that part as well.  It comes with more than enough thread. It is very thick.  Almost as thick as strings from window blinds but flat.  I would only buy extra if you want a different color or texture of thread.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone looking to spend as little as possible but still wants a factory look to their wheel.
B00LH205PA|5|This is exactly what I needed to install a fuel pressure gauge on my 1993 Sierra. This is the only one that I have found that is compatible with my vehicle and doesn't cost an arm and a leg to purchase. I am extremely happy and the Throttle Body Shop had it shipped out ASAP, it arrived a day before I expected it.
B004GCA2HO|4|Great price and shipping was very quick
B00KMHODXG|5|Great helmet, fits like a glove.  Love the classic white look.  You will not find a better helmet for the price.  I paired this with a mirrored bubble shield from Biltwell.  Awesome old school look.
B007T138DO|5|Fits perfectly.
B00A9MO2XK|5|Works great.
B000JFL8RK|5|geart
B001GN6YVE|5|just as expected
B00L1CO4YE|5|Runs just a wee bit small but love it
B0014COKYU|4|This is a good deodorizer and cleaner.  I saw all the positive reviews and thought I would try it.  Works good, glad I found it.
B000JZYWQO|5|I didn't like the fact that this muffler shipped without any packaging.  It took some damage during shipping, but those dents seem to be superficial, mostly on the heat shield welded to the top of the muffler.<br /><br />The fit is good, but read the description and reviews carefully.  This muffler fits my 1998 Honda Civic DX two door coupe.  It doesn't fit the hatchback.  Installation only took me about 20 minutes, and since I live in the sun belt rather than the rust belt, I was able to reuse the original screws and springs with no problem.<br /><br />The muffler does a great job muffling the sound of my engine.  I'm not sure if I'm so impressed because I've been driving without a muffler or if this muffler is better than the original, but my car seems quieter than it's ever been.<br /><br />We'll see how long it lasts.  If it doesn't last long, I'll be back to edit this review.
B008XZS9J8|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00K24JDBG|5|Was the product I needed and fit just like it was suppose to, easy to apply.
B00B0PB3X2|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00G6Q5KNY|4|Good enough.
B000L9SMR8|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00R6S0MEI|1|Made in China……….. The American flag photo tricked me. Also the package says nothing about a Lifetime No-Hassle Guarantee. Maybe it does have a Lifetime No-Hassle Guarantee, but it sure doesn't say anything about it on the packaging.
B000FQ7CUA|5|Great Gasket...it was very gaskety
B012KLV1H2|5|WOW!! This is the best multi-use product in the market. It is made with high quality materials and 100% leak proof. It is super easy to clean and very easy to install. It has two mesh pockets and one thermo pocket for drink. I like that it can be really be use in many ways, like as a car trash bag, for fishing, shopping, beach bag, travelling, car organizer and much more. I used it yesterday as a cooler to take some drinks and snacks to my son’s baseball game. I recommend this product. If my review helped you in any way can you please click the like button! I received this for a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.
B009LPYHI6|5|It fit great. Not having any problems with it. Great product. I Recomend it if you need to replace.
B00PXXTQ9A|5|Does the job of the [[ASIN:B00132CG2E Fill-Rite FR1612 Portable Diesel Fuel Transfer Pump - 12 V DC, 10 GPM, 1/5 HP, 3/4&#34; NPT Inlet, No Nozzle]] at half the price.
B005FL2N22|5|Great product - ok so I can't really stop on a dime- I have an SUV , but it does significantly shorten the stopping distance without locking it up and engaging the ABS.
B00B4KTI5I|4|Just installed this regulator and motor, so I cannot comment on durability over time, but being an ACDelco part, I am sure it will last.  The motor is probably two to three times as loud as the OEM motor, so this product lost a star.
B001B73WCO|1|Single can covered about 1/3 of a night stand.
B002A3E3HQ|5|Works great and easy to clean.
B002L6DPOE|4|So far very nice.  Only a few hundred miles.
B00GGM9CLO|1|NOT REAL CARBON FIBER, NOT SHIPPED FROM CALIFORNIA SHIPPED FROM CHINA!!!!!!! FRAUD FAKE NOT HAPPY WITH THESE JUNK EMBLEMS
B00902G1MK|4|Replaced original door check that was squeaking badly. Works very well except it's a little too strong but may loosen with use.
B004QHI5XW|1|the hub bearing came with sensor abs broken i dont recomended
B001NZQIDE|5|Perfect!
B000K1YPLO|5|Had it on my tour pack for two months of summer riding and love the way it looks. Easy fit, holds great, very happy!
B01230FTBY|5|I like them.  they look real nice on the bike.
B009DJZFYU|1|poor quality
B00MHY3S0Q|5|great tool…great transaction
B00C15M4WO|5|This battery cranks my 2011 Dyna Superglide better than original Harley battery. Fit perfectly and no install problems at all.
B00ZEJGDT4|5|If you have a Ram Diesel, you have to get this!  Not only does it look great, it is easy to remove for fueling.  I especially like the embedded magnet whereas it sticks to the fuel door bracket so I can't lose it!!  What a great product!!
B008I7OFQW|5|Exact fit replacement for a good value - saved over $250 doing it myself from dealer quote.  Watched a YouTube video on how to remove the Ford truck door panel that was very helpful.  Took about an hour overall for a novice to complete and works great.
B000P6WROG|5|Just like it says, a handy tool if you have big nuts.
B000BYEKCY|5|The product is installed and works fine
B0101SLT5U|5|I absolutely LOVE it!  It makes my dash beautiful!  Going to order two more for my friends!
B00UT6206C|2|It was very cool looking but it broke during the first 3 days. I have the white one, and whenever it snagged on something, the clip would just come undone, but on this one, the metal ring thing completely snapped when it got caught on a chair. Maybe it's just my luck, I'm not sure.
B00B8ZHP0O|5|The part fit great and I received it within days of ordering the part
B000Q71N8K|5|Excellent buy
B00SV54M00|4|Great addition - only problem I have is that the ball does not fit TomTom mounts.  You need to buy an aftermarket 17mm mount for those to fit on the ball arm.
B008RO3DHI|5|It was exelent;thank you Amazon for job well done!!!!!
B003SOKEXI|5|This got my mirrors working.  Great
B000LS8ZRG|5|I highly recommend them.  Great weight - you  won't have to worry about someone trying to &#34;steel the item you're locking up&#34;
B003XVHK4W|5|A+
B0050J4FMK|5|So far so good! Used this in my Honda ct110!
B00EU6LFUO|1|These brake pads were so bad my mechanic refused to install them. They were thinner that the ones I was replacing. I considered them so poor that I chose not to return as I wouldn't want them resold. Absolutely a rip off!!!!
B005G0Q846|5|I love them
B00VLER6CE|5|This was a gift and was a great hit.  The box on the other had was smashed. Looked like it had polishing liquid on it.
B005OS5BI4|1|Unclear to no instructions
B001HBSI6O|5|great stuff.....just be sure to top coat with a good wax
B0050ISS7Y|5|Using it on a 2007 Town and Country without a problem. My &#34;Gascap&#34; warning turned off when I started using this new one. 35 percent cheaper that what the dealer was charging, although the dealer said they would install it for free. (Really? You'll put on a gas cap for free? How generous.)
B004HMBK5G|4|Not bad but it's a bit glitchy to adjust so I forget to use it half the times.  Got the neck protector elsewhere and it almost eliminates the need for this.
B008VFQE42|1|Doesn't work on the standard jeep can.
B000W0RQ8C|5|excellent
B00MOCR0VY|1|came all bent up
B00N42701I|4|Love the color in my dash. Prefer it over the original green.
B007OW6MD6|4|I have only use this item once and it work for my vehicle,
B000SATCFG|5|great
B007S2U1FW|5|fits fine, fair price
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Very Brite Happy With
B000H0RDB2|5|These wear not what I thought they were
B006FZRDE0|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.  Its been a few months now and the cuality is great.  Thanks
B005NLQAHS|4|It works!
B0028R1IHW|5|Exactly want I want. A decal to put my back window of my car. I love the art work  the skull on fire with the tribal art. Captured what I wanted.
B0016HURFO|5|fast delivery and product worked great
B00WMK3O7W|5|Received these the other day. They shipped quickly and fit wonderfully into my 2007 Suzuki XL-7. Would purchase again, however these look like they are going to last a very long time as durable as they are!
B005BNYXHW|4|Got it on time and worked great. Only had to shorten original hinge pin
B00E9BEB7O|5|makes the '03 stang look awesome just like the 1964.5 mustang.
B00HG76A9A|5|My BMW's like it!  This is the oil I use for my 2003 525i and 2001 Z3 2.5.  Great price found here.
B00CQ8NF7E|5|Great
B0079GV30Y|5|Fit, mileage when up 2MPG
B007Y03YY8|1|Exactly what I ordered.  Speaker are not Lloyd enough and aux plug is not secure
B002BELP3Y|5|Good product, and has no issues. Price is okay too.
B00NLMSDOE|3|The cover worked adequately in Phoenix for 6 months of summer heat, but by the end it was so flakey and dusty from falling apart, it was making the car dirtier. It just couldn't put up with Arizona UV rays. I had to add additional plastic clips, with bungee cords, to keep it in place in the wind. It kept hard water stains off the car which is why it was purchased in the first place. If sun is your primary concern I cannot recommend this product for long term use.
B00NPIF4LY|5|Product was exactly as advertised and was delivered quickly.
B000UVUAFO|4|Like other reviewers have said, you got to elbow grease into it! Curtsey of street parking in San Francisco, I had two long white scratches that stretched across almost the entirety of the hood of my black car (how someone scratched the hood of my car, I will never know).  They were not super deep, although I could feel them with my fingernail.  I went over both scratches probably four or five times.  I also scrubbed HARD! I probably was scrubbing for an hour total (I believe the directions state that you should scrub for two minutes).  Although the directions state that you should scrub perpendicular to scratch, for my scratches I found it helped to go with the scratch.  Ultimately, the scratches are almost completely gone.  I don't think you would be able to see them unless you were looking for them.  This is a great product if you're looking for a cheap option to get rid of noticeable, but not super deep scratches.
B00EHLACWO|5|For we works Good!<br />lil tricky to put in on place! Be careful! :)))))))
B00QZHXZAY|5|Easy Iron on and holds very well to cotton/polyester Tactical vest not sure  about how well the iron on will hold on to leather.<br />the rocker patch get' s the point across what you are and who you represent which is the Everlasting King of kings and Lord of lords Yeshua Ha'Maciach!
B00P3BLDGG|5|Very nais
B007AAUTG8|2|Resolution is horrible, can`t hardly see the hitch , which is the reason I bought it, to help with backing up to a trailer. still takes a few times to get it right since the picture is pretty bad.
B007V2BOCI|5|Works perfect......and reduces the inside heat by 15-20 degrees.....Use it everyday!
B012Q1Z34I|5|exact fit,<br />product was good price and met all the functions and quality listed.
B0006HM9MY|5|Great product
B004306VTC|5|I love my rug!
B004AQZUX2|5|works as advertised
B011KHEHWS|4|Nice Microfiber towel. I used it on my friends Mustang but the microfiber towel would get heavy and we would have to wring it numerous times or it would stop drying the vehicle.<br />Worked god for a short while but not as absorbent as it claims.<br />Does not leave streaks or lint, so that part is great, just needs to be more absorbent.
B00K69YXS0|2|These would work for a can or small drink cup. I wouldn't recommend this for anything larger.
B00IMVNKOM|5|bought one and it worked great...so great, someone stole it.  I have high water pressure and this thing is perfect.  I have been through a bunch of different ones similar to this, but this one never broke or started leaking.
B00WLLYFPW|4|These fit in the license plate light sockets of a 2003 nissan frontier
B005QION72|5|This is by far my favorite helmet and worth every penny great value!
B00PP79NAQ|5|Great Piece of Gear For Your Jeep...!
B00DHD183U|5|Excelent
B007GIYO2Y|5|Nice cover, easy install!
B000CSGX5G|5|As described
B0024E6ZW2|5|Really helped with creaking and moaning of steps, not to mention the overall support it adds to the coach. We have a Jayco 355 MBQS
B003V8CW3Q|5|Excellent lighter weight helmet for 5 to 7 yo
B004AIPW7E|5|Fit perfectly.  Saved me $$$.  Haven't had a problem since installation.
B000IYPSZU|5|THIS ITEM FIT PERFECT TO MY HONDA ACCORD 2006 AND IT WORKS FINE, IT IS WELL BUILT IT
B00FC21ZT6|4|Great lights, really enjoy them. I feel they may be a little more dim than the stock bulbs. I would asume if theres were installed in a projector housing it would be different.
B00W2NMO3Y|5|Frame rail pad arrived on time, exactly as described, in excellent new condition  and packed very well.<br /><br />Very useful for added jack safety and stability.
B001P2LAH4|5|VERY GOOD product at a VERY GOOD price, here on Amazon. 5th set on the 5 F-350, DRW's I've owned. But If you are ordering a replacement bag.. be careful.. there are 2 different bracket mounting patterns.. for 6781 and/or the 6401 bags... depends on which &#34;kit&#34; you have.<br />(don't ask me how I leaned that)<br /><br />Joe
B003EOE2A8|5|great!
B00JJRGYNW|5|Coll sticker
B005LGTSMO|5|I was able to replace this setting in a wheelchair after looking at a utube video . Broken leg I can walk now and door is still working fine.<br />Larry
B000BYGFGI|5|Plugs went on fine with my 4.0 straight 6 1995 jeep grand cherokee
B001THQP84|5|Works great!
B00QJ8FA70|5|Great product, worked excellent
B00196OZLY|5|Love this cover ... it's not a &#34;snug&#34; fit but shaped perfectly for a wrangler. It's very easy to toss on-and-off quickly.  I've had it over the Summer for now and it has held up great in the CA sun. We don't get that much rain but it does fine in the rain too. I am not too concerned about the jeep's finish (it's an offroader) but wanted something to keep the dust and sap off the vehicle parked in our back yard.
B00ZJICU5G|2|no for this job I need another tool but in the days coming I will review the product
B000FGCYT4|5|great product and service...
B002R4NG1M|5|Fits perfectly, showed up quickly.
B00FCDVZZ4|5|Fast shipping. Perfect product. Thank you. I will come back later.
B000F5LJ3M|5|GOOD TOOLS
B00DU90AYE|5|was simple to install and works just great!
B005FKHPTY|5|Perfect fit. Very simple DIY. Quality of the metals/materials seems to be high. Time will tell.  This set was 15% cheaper than everywhere else I shopped.
B005PRBTNU|5|great cover, fits like a glove no need for tie downs  Fits better than my California car cover for my Hot Rod at a third the price
B00FFD53DG|5|Very good cargo bar
B000S6NU9O|5|Nice pipes. Chrome was excellent and the pipes bolted right up and sound good.
B00WIUB6FS|5|This is a great license plate frame by i-Striker. It is made with rust-resistant metal frames. The color is matte black which i really like. There is a i-Striker logo on the bottom left. The license plate frame is extremely easy to install using your vehicle's original plate screws. There are two holes in the frame which perfectly line with original bracket. The size of the frame is 6-inch x 12-inch which is regular US plate size. I really like this frame, it is very simple yet elegant. The license plate frame also comes with one year replacement warranty against factory defects.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: It was packed in plastic bag. The shipping was also very fast. I got the license plate frame within two days after placing the order online. I bought this at a discounted price for unbiased review. This sure is a great looking license plate frame by by i-Striker.It sure will look great on any car.Below are two pictures of the license plate frame which i took before installing.
B00KSXW04S|1|The adaptor that plugs into the oem headlight wiring doesn't fit. No options to exchange
B007REFW32|1|Horrible.  The colors are not the same.  The colors look faded and the decal looks very cheap overall.  Not worth it at all.
B002X9TNFE|5|Nice accent decal.
B00M0VKSTK|5|Thank you!
B00IBONM20|5|These are the best mats available - do not slip and totally mud, dog and water proof!!
B00FAWUCMO|5|Awesome hat....thanks so much<br />.
B005CHFD62|5|This fits great on your tag and is probably the best one to use now if you are going to use one. Some what unnoticeable
B000VKVXSW|5|Works great and is reasonably priced.
B00230EAOW|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0001EFSTI|4|But first I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to use this very much, but I've used it every day since I got it. Comes in handy.
B00GI5YQ88|3|It was of a good quality but did not fit the model of my car.
B0018JXIXI|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0064SGRPE|3|The overall effect is good, however fitment is well below par, the hardware supplied doesn't quite fit the bill - everything seems a little forced. There's also a nut/bolt towards the top of the grill, after install, that will make it hard to fit back on the Jeep. Side note is that we also did the Rugged Ridge hood lock for the JK and you can't reach the lock with their grill in place. You would think since they're from the same mfr. they'd work together but no - looks like we'll be cutting a small section of the mesh out so we can get to the hood lock...  I'd recommend it but be prepared to take your time to make it all work out nice nice.  This was installed on a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport.
B000CO86BY|5|holds up pretty well it came pretty fast and yes for those who cant read it comes with two
B00P3XQP9O|4|Seems well made, doing the job so far. MADE IN USA
B004BTBUXC|4|Really enjoyed the LOOK....
B0036E9VB6|5|Much nicer than unit it replaced.  Seems sturdy.  Very precise gauge.
B0012ETJ1O|5|Replaced a set of GE NIGHTHAWK PLATINUMS with these and they are brighter. Wife has a crap drive over a mountain at night and isn't one to notice things like headlight brightness. Didn't realize she had a bulb out until pulled over. She definitely realized how bright these bulbs were in comparison to the GEs which were a big step up from stock.<br /><br />Well worth it.
B007WMFQ3A|5|great part
B00RMNNAKA|5|a like this product
B000BO913C|3|it did the job
B00G66ASPE|5|Got a P0446 code on a 99 4Runner. Guessed it was a loose gas cap after looking at the dried out gasket on the inside of the old one and silence when removing the cap. Ordered this as a replacement. Over 800 miles, no further CELs, and the gas tank makes &#34;whoosh&#34; sounds again after unscrewing the cap. Very happy camper indeed.
B00L8417NQ|3|Hey if you do HPDE track events in your M3 this is the best bang for the buck- I've bought OEM very expensive - these work and install the same as factory, I use laminex clear tint now I don't break the lens,,
B001DIECCK|5|Best way to patch a tire! Very reliable. Even a girl can do it!  My Dad has used this brand of tire repair kit for many years. He recommended it to me. Do t believe what the tire stores tell you about plugs not working. He's never had one fail.
B001AIZ5HY|5|If you're willing to take 2.5 hours to do a careful job it turns out great.  If you don't read the instructions or try to get done in an hour it will not turn out so great.  It is important to leave a uniform surface with no white or clear spots with the first grit. I found that washing the sandpaper in water would rejuvenate it to some degree.  I also found it advantageous to do final hand sanding with each sandpaper grit using horizontal back and forth motions.  Then, in the next step, when the horizontal scratches are gone you're done.
B00LA0OEN8|5|Looked great lots of complements
B001FCAY8U|5|Works as advertised.
B008XNZZ7O|5|Smells great
B009O0RRJE|5|prefect
B0024E6ZW2|5|Best if 2 Jacks are used.....excellent support and easy to use.
B00BFI5SE4|4|Doesn't make much of a difference with thing CDI box, it runs a little slower against wind but going with the wind I was 5 extra mph
B0046R92KW|5|fit perfect
B006RMMN3M|1|Didn't work at all
B002JL04W2|5|Works great, huge difference in lighting quality between these and the stock halogen bulbs. The 4300k looks stock not like them cheesy blue ones I see some cars retrofitted with. 2012 Chevy volt
B0072UGXSY|5|Compact, Sleek design - mounted easily and appears to be working well. Great buy!
B00A8WXZIE|5|I use it for riding dirtbikes in the dusty weather in summer time, works awesome, stays put and I inhale way less dust that normally.
B000ET525K|5|Best One i have purchased for car tire repair. I recommend it highly AAA+++
B00J4Z8U4A|4|Look like quality product. Too large for my Genuine Scooter Company Roughhouse 50 (aka PGO PMX 50 Naked) stock variator. I'm not upset because I know that cloned engines can all be different. Possible to modify to fit by cutting them down but my stock ones felt just as hard and slick as these.
B00029XGNM|5|works on my chinese scooter
B00HTVZKD0|5|A+++
B004HXFUUQ|5|two thumbs up.
B00MQ19XXQ|4|Correct shape, but the size was slightly smaller than the original.<br /><br />Still works fine tough.
B005ASY23I|5|Works well at pumping up my 33's. Can get a little hot to the touch but its running a lot of air. I just make sure I don't touch it while its running. Other than that its worked wonderful. I've had mine for over a year now. Can't complain. I'd buy another if I needed it. Superfast. You won't be disappointed.
B002DU3TTO|5|works great
B00NY0S2OY|2|Easy break
B005IUY9JK|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00EPDLFJS|5|Just what I wanted.
B00BQGIWCK|4|Easy fit on my 2010 Golf- so glad I replaced my old wiper!
B001QVE5VM|5|Bought for my 96 tacoma, they are 555 engraved, look high quality and have a hole for a grease zerk. Steering is nice and tight now, I would recommend these over moog, it's a better design with no spring inside. Install was almost easy, needed some special tools. I canot speak for its longevity but I have confidence in this product. The only odd thing I encountered is one had a blue boot and one had a black boot, different p/n, one left one right, but who cares about the boot color.
B002UVGR54|5|nice product
B000NPUJQC|5|Does its job ! And it's really cheap !
B00JX70NOY|1|Well fixed the light but it looks like it doesn't flash as bright as other light?
B007JSGR9Y|5|Plugged it in and got the codes within seconds, good for the price.
B001CO4WA2|5|It's a good coil...epoxy filled and this price was very good compared to other places.
B0031HI0HY|2|Great price but had to return because it didn't fit. I used the car calculator before I purchased and it stated that it would fit me car but nope. If did fit, Ibwouldve kept it. Great price. Fast service.
B00GUF74HQ|1|not good  the bolt that goes into the tailgate just strips out
B00EFPDU3K|5|Great product at a great price. And shipped ontime. Front only
B00L237SUO|3|It serves it's purpose but it is cheaply made and bulkier than I expected.
B00GMIN8IU|1|just bought this item but it does not come with the brackets! where do i buy the brackets now??
B001C8WP8Y|5|I installed the Yellow DP41255R brakes pads on my 2004 jeep wrangler along the new centric premium rotors. Wow, what a difference in quality and performance. Only have about 300 miles on them, very little break in squeaking.  With 33 inch tires on the jeep and along with pulling my drift boat, I am a very happy with the purchase. Saved big dollars ordering through amazon
B00I4CLY6A|5|Great small Squeegee, works like it should.
B00TM9BF18|5|Very nice!
B00L9R3P6Y|3|thought I was buying WeatherTech, sent it back...
B002OKLZRQ|5|a- ok
B000FOUB8M|5|good to have
B00ATRV3Z0|5|Arrived promptly, installed easily, works as designed without problems. I am perfectly happy, and it was much cheaper (half?) than the dealer wanted.
B00UXXJHTO|5|Easy to reprogram... Excellent purchase
B000O8D9X8|5|Works perfect for our needs!! We use it to fill our horse trough from a shallow brook (pump sits on a glass pie plate so it don't suck up sand) I added 20 feet of wire to it with a 12 volt plug on the end and we plug it into the four wheeler to power it.  I figure that it pumps about 300 gallons an hour the way I have it set up with 25 feet of garden hose attached to it and a different of 3 feet in rise.
B00B2YE4B4|5|bought these for the light in the ice box.....works great  highly recommend
B001653EHO|4|Product came fast was cheaper than anyone else, looks good haven't installed it yet,disappointed there was no sticker. I'm sure it will sound gteat.

B00DNXIOPE|5|Awesome product, recommended.
B003UTH088|3|The Key Fob is great once I got it programed at a locksmith for 40 Dollars.  The<br />directions did not work for my 2011 Yukon Denali.  Apparently any model 2011 and<br />up requires a dealership or locksmith to program.  Still saved some cash as opposed to buying<br />directly from the dealership.  I am happy with the purchase just wish I would have know prior.<br />I read some reviews but not all.
B009E33OXO|4|I would give it 5 stars if it came with a case for storage.
B002A3MYOK|2|fast shippin but poor quality the black is already starting to fade.
B001G4TV6S|1|The chinese guys who made this have never seen an American coupler.  Absolutely will not work..........
B00NTOJU28|5|Really makes a difference especially the interior
B000UBVY36|2|Does not fit a 2003 chevy silverado  ls. Other wise it looked like a high quality  product
B001JR64UI|4|This is a very good product and on test worked fine.  However it won't fit my present vehicle as the bulbs insert from the rear of the light cluster fitting and the products diameter is to great to fit through the available fitting hole.  I have not worked out a way around this problem yet.  My problem.
B00CB8WM2S|5|I've always wanted one of this in case of emergency because we travel a lot. I'm so happy and grateful to have had the opportunity to received this great product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion because this tool makes me feel more secure. It's lightweight, very well constructed and it looks very easy to use.The size is perfect and is easy to store in the car. This is a great safety tool that everyone should have in their cars! Safety is first so It's best to make sure that you always have one of this useful tool close at hand, just in case the worst does happen and you need to break out of a vehicle window following a road accident. I highly recommend this product.
B00Y5MBMG0|1|garbage, removed it from jeep in one day. Don't waste your money.

B008IXN58U|5|cood aa++
B00FLVV6O2|5|Was the exact part, packagee nicely and the price was better than where i've bought it before.
B00TP0I210|5|Fits perfectly. Easy to install.
B00HZOCCBY|3|This set fits my 2015 Rogue SV just OK, not a perfect fit. Particularly the cargo tray did not fit as the picture shows. so I do not think the picture on this product page is for 2015 Rogue SV. Besides, the product I received also looks different from the picture shown here on this page, e.g. the driver's side looks totally different. I will post my pictures later.
B00HUG0XQI|5|Very nice jack at a great price and shipped much quicker than expected!
B0068OCPKA|5|Amazing quality, fit, and finish!
B00BXLE7M2|5|Great product
B001LHVOVK|3|Works ok for what I need
B009QM6GYW|4|Descent quality at a affordable price. I took off a star because the ends could have been ground down a little more. I think they should do the job and last a good while.
B004WCV1OG|2|Scent wore off after a week.  Definitely much better car freshners on the market
B00PSTCFFG|5|Best cleaner I have found for glass doors on wood burning stove. ..
B009YZKL38|5|fast delivery exact fit.
B00BHI5130|1|Broke the first day. Don't waste your money. Im furious.

B005TOLSBC|5|Does the trick!

B005H4EZWI|5|awesome
B00N5C28BO|1|Did not siphon gas from gas tank despite repeated/multiple attempts.
B000BYB3J2|5|The wires worked fine
B00HUM66I6|4|The only think I do not like is that it does not fit all the way on the sides and around the mirror but it does keep the truck cool.
B0080KN7RU|5|another way to let the living know you will stand with them against the undead!
B00KJGCEXG|1|I took the key to have it cut and it fell apart as soon as I used it once.
B000WJBQ5W|4|Great exhaust and Fast delivery!! It looks good and was easy to install. They sound great, especially in the lower gears. They are also very loud but they do come with baffles.
B0022ZJX1I|5|Very pleased, fast shipping, fit well and vercomfortable
B009W85R4A|4|Fits my 2000 Chevy 2500 nicely.  Strings are a bit of a pain in the ass but it was expected.  With a little patience and time it will fit correctly and you will be able to fold the seat down to access storage behind seat.  I put brass grommets for the headrest post as another reviewer suggested.  The material and quality are pretty much from what I remember on a Saddleman seat cover from 30 years ago.  There is no rifle scabbard like they used to have but I live in NJ now and not on a Texas ranch.  It does have pockets which are handy and the slots for the seatbelts are an improvement.  The ends of the material at the pockets are not bound but can be heat sealed with a lighter flame to keep from unfraying.  All said and done it looks great on my truck and is durable enough for many years of use.
B00ANR0L36|5|wonderful
B004AE0MUU|5|Amazing! Love this.. I was an idiot that backed into a dumpster. Got this item in scheduled timeframe, and it is shiny and new. Perfect fit. Took all of 2 minutes to install (2 screws)
B001RBCU90|5|Cute! Totally as described!

B00N18LXJ0|5|works great
B00DZPC5NM|5|Worked perfectly with Chrysler town and country 2014 and easy for kids to use. My 6 year old had no problems. The addition of remote is great as we bought car used and it didn't come with one.
B00T2GT9L4|5|Great deal, fast delivery.
B00G8S07FQ|4|cool sticker, ordered 3 received 4.
B000QGI69A|5|Perfect fit
B007VR9T8Y|5|3&#34; turn downs, exactly how it shows in the pictures. Came with all the flanges and hardware, bolted right up. Made my mustang into a street sweeper. Somehow I should be getting paid to drive around my town.
B00R6W6G7Q|5|Great detail...  these models are getting better all the time.
B00008RW9V|5|Just what I needed for my cars!
B00S5O3DIY|5|We purchased this product for our backyard wedding as we had 20 children coming, all under the age of 4 (we're crazy, we know!!). I wanted something for kids to do, so I got 2 rolls of the chalkboard adhesive and stuck it to our fence to make one giant chalkboard. It was a hit!!! I was nervous that it would be difficult to put up and that it wouldn't work that well. It was a breeze to set-up and even when we had to reposition it, the adhesive peeled off and stuck again perfectly!! Also, regular chalk worked great on this product and the kids (and adults) loved it!! Great product and I love that after the wedding we were able to reuse / repurpose the chalkboard rolls to different areas of our house!! Great product!!
B00GR8V7LU|5|Perfect, right on time
B00PT18QAQ|5|big numbers, solid build quality and great price
B00DJ5KEEA|1|This thing seems to take the power out of the battery, not happy

B00D42AFS8|5|this unit is very compact.  I've had it for 3 months now but I haven't needed to use it yet to start a car with a dead battery but it's nice to know that I have this  in my center console.
B00FBKWG60|5|Cool Very blue easy install

B003ZF1GJQ|5|Suggested by a marine tech.  Works great!
B00PXFIMCK|5|Right part.  Very fast delivery!
B00M0TLQ66|5|If you want to protect your investment, look no further.  Forget the vinegar, and use Evapo-Rust; gently removes the rust away.  Best part: You don't need to purchase multiple gallons; pour one gallon into a 5-gallon bucket, start with the smaller tools first, let it soak in for 10-30 minutes, or even longer if you prefer.  Remove tools from bucket, dry them with a rag, and your tools are good as new (figure of speech).  One gallon can be reused several times.  Once you're done with one round of cleaning your tools, use a funnel and pour the contents back into the 1-gallon jug, and keep for reuse.  Dispose the product only after the contents turn sludge-black.  One gallon should last you year long, or even longer.
B0009618HO|5|Very nice stool!
B000C542NY|2|not all they are cracked up to be poor quality
B00MJ470RG|5|Bought it for my 2002 Acura MDX. Fit it perfectly with some extra slack! The warranty is great and will definitely take advantage of that when the product starts showing wear and tare. This will help me keep my vehicle clean and protected from bird dropping, leaves, and other substances/elements. Posted 08/31/2015
B004G9VIXE|5|part got here sooner than scheduled. works flawless. This was for my wife's minivan.
B00BDEP9S0|4|Seems to be sturdy and well made.  Not ran in to a situation where I needed something like this yet but the one time I will need it and not have it will erk me to say the least.  Price isn't too bad at under $10 and lets face it it is the small nickle and dime type items that we are always forgetting when you first start off as a RVer
B0005JNPE4|4|Works as advertised. Recommended
B0031I805U|5|oem equipment for a great price!
B000CON4MU|5|With the propper wire gauge starter works fine.
B0040CTTH4|5|I bought this clip to re-attach the plastic trim to the interior of the passenger seat. I was worried it might require a different clip, since the the original clip was a different color. This replacement fit perfectly.
B002SE1GB8|5|Cool
B008DSDT36|5|Fits my Audi TDI as indicated and an OEM product.
B005N53C9I|2|Fantastic delivery time.  However, the product was very inferior.  Straps broke instantly, fit was poor at best.  Perhaps just a poor choice on my part?  Eventually threw it out.
B002YI92NC|1|Firebricks are typically bricks that are specially resistant to fire; for use in lining wood stoves or as a base for a welding station.  These are actually bricks made of wood products, meant to be burned, not meant to resist fire.  Please label appropriately.  I'll keep them for my emergency kit, not worth sending back.
B003YP4KG8|1|This item not fit for elantra 2008 GLS
B0012UFZRA|1|Wrong size, contray to the description it does not fit a 2005 tacoma
B0002SRDR8|5|Works great!
B00GURR52S|1|Cheap garbage wouldn't recommend
B0000AY2Z6|5|For the trailer, this is a great fan for those hot summer days when we have to travel across the state for our family trip.
B001HLIMD8|4|Too hot for summer but very soft.  In the glove compartment waiting for cold weather.
B008FCD8DG|5|great price and fast shipper
B008KKKK34|5|Bought to fill up my tool box with stickers. There are more than twenty five stickers in it with all different sizes alot of them i like but there are a couple i didnt care for didnt bother me though i juat gave them away to my co workers i had plenty for myself diffently recommend
B00F27R518|5|Great microfiber cloths.  Gets the job done.
B00SNQ5MBU|4|Looking forward to using these in my vehicle
B000CL9I1Y|5|if you own a saturn s-series BUY THIS NOW! many of the original saturn S-series cars came with a plastic sensor that can crack! resulting in misguided temp readings! your fans may not come on. and your computer will not think the engine is warmed up causing it to run rich and burn more gas. so you havent replaced yours yet do it now!
B003IHKXKY|5|thanks
B00B2HP1B8|5|Very easy to install and very sturdy.<br />Very happy.
B00KTHZ58G|4|Works great just sometimes I have to reprogram do both remotes work wide loves it.
B00GWFKUE8|4|Perfect fit, dead pedal covering is a bit short though... I like these better than weather tech, better rubber material, while weather tech feels more like plastic. No rubber smell either. I would recommend these mats.
B00NQ11AQI|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B004BH1XHC|4|Good key ring, not lazer etched as stated however.
B0002STSGC|5|Happy with procuct
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|This battery charger/jumper is awesome!  The very first day we had to jump start the 4 wheeler because the battery was low on charge.  It started it right up with no hesitation.  We love it!  It has so many adapters to fit just about any device!  Awesome...
B00IM9A6VO|5|Perfect
B003UT0L7A|1|Don't buy this stuff. It's too concentrated and you'll never get this stuff out of the carpet if you aren't using a hot water extractor. Unfortunately I'm stuck with this stuff.
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Quality sticker! Adds a great look to back window of my truck!!
B0062NMG6K|5|Great quality shipped on time
B008P73QLK|4|I love v-neck fitted shirts
B000C9S78G|3|get wrong part number, but send fast
B0068M0SNI|5|Great price, thanks.
B00RGZWIW0|5|I love this product. It is definitely built well. It is so useful to have it in my car. I put my first aid kit and car emergency kit in one half along with gym shoes and whatever else I want. The other half I usually leave empty because I put food in there when I have to go food. I don't like putting food in my car so when I transport food, it's going in the trunk in this trunk organizer. It holds the containers in place even if I drive crazy. I love this organizer. I should get it to give as gifts this Christmas.
B0013V6NBA|5|Awesome, good quality, love it!
B003PA07DC|1|I ordered it to replace my original beige handle. When i got it it wasn't beige it was gray! And the mounting tabs were on wrong! Ine was facing the right way and the other backwards! So i can't even mout it to my wifes car. And the handle strap is flimsy,  and rubbery not sturdy like factory.
B001C6NL52|5|just what I needed!
B00LTAT1P0|5|high quality parts at a fraction of the retail store's prices. Factory OEM part was close to 500 dollars while evergreen was closer to 100 dollars. I as a business owner in the same location for 30 years who needs to save money wherever I can will be using this Brand and Store for all of my future automotive needs.
B00CD2RGZA|5|came fast  ..there nice
B00CVFIIZG|5|These are great. I like the feel to it and just overall quality. It confirms to my keys so they're nice and snug. It takes a bit of muscle and finesse to put it on though, but be patient and it will get through.
B005TY2G9A|5|Awsome fit and on time delivery
B0031BAAQE|5|I'm 330 lbs and these springs support my aggressive riding. These along with Racetech Gold Valve Emulators have made my Sprint ST feel like a completely different bike.
B000B61TPS|5|Great unit
B0070Y36FK|1|This product was just as wrinkled in the center of the whole role as the one that this was to replace never again
B00INU56TY|1|This product is terrible. Works well at first but started going out one by one. They are spotty. They sent new ones but the same thing. Do not but
B00062ZPWU|5|Quality seems better than expected.<br />Do realize that if you use this with the stainless braid hose kit, you end result can look nice, but it is NOT a quick 5 minute job!  The stainless braiding can be difficult to cut & overall quite time consuming.<br /><br />But obviously this can be used with or with any type of hose braid. I also notice that the 3/8&#34; &#34;Gates&#34; brand fuel hose that I had was a bit larger OD, And although I couldn't use the gates hose with the braid, it still would have fit just using the hose with no braid, I.E., the ends were large enough.
B00K5B2DWC|5|didn't bother checking price at the dealer, this was a great price and popped right in to replace OEM fixture that somehow dried up and cracked. 2010 Chevy Equinox
B00HCSBQ7Y|5|Get it !  A little purple, but nice!
B00Q3YDJYQ|1|I don't see difference
B00CNX98R8|5|I love it, great price and  just like I wanted it and exactly like it shows. Recommend it :)
B00BD4YFO4|3|did not like the material
B007Q1MMAM|5|Fits perfectly. Looks and works great.
B004MNOJS0|5|Genuine OE paint at a fair price.  Prompt shipping and color match.
B00LIRVV2K|5|Easy installation perfect fit and looks great!
B000GD5FMY|5|My husband loves these!
B000BZI26S|5|Installed in my 2001 Lexus LS430 without any surprises.  Appears to be very high quality part.  After 30-miles, it's working correctly, and solved the P0155 CEL code (a bad heater circuit on Bank 2 Sensor 1.)  The job was fairly challenging due to the part's location in the exhaust manifold, but was possible without any special heroics.  Here are the steps:<br />1) Jack the car up so you can reach engine freely from underneath.<br />2) Remove both plastic skirts from the under the engine & tranny.  (When done, re-install with screwdriver to avoid stripping plastic seats.)<br />3) Locate the failing upstream O2 sensor.<br />4) Pop connector off its metal mount.  A very small flat screwdriver will work to lift the latch.  Once loose, you can squeeze the release button on the connector and tug the wires on the bad sensor side until she separates.<br />5) Now use a small set of needle nose pliers to release the cable clip.  Don't break it, as you can re-use it.<br />6) Finally, soak the bad sensor with penetrating oil, give it time to work, and use an O2 sensor socket to pull the part.  It was easiest to turn the socket using a 1&#34; wrench, and not a ratchet!  You reach it from the side.<br />7) Install the new O2 sensor after transferring the clip to the correct location...don't over-tighten.  Perform above steps in reverse order.<br />8) Reset CEL code.
B00JAJWJM4|5|These are great. I put them in the drivers side lower windshield to cover up a small crack in my windshield. I bought the white eyes and they complement my truck color very well...!
B0013FU3TO|5|Great product was very well worth the purchase 15 stars thank you so much
B00I0GMYQO|4|The fit was not as I expected.
B007KFMJ8Y|5|This kit fit my 2011 Toyota RAV4 Sport V6 4x4 with no problems or adjustments. Looks great, break in as written.
B00YI6VKQA|1|I'm pretty pissed cuz one light is bluer than the other one. So it's uneven. I just got them put on and.now it drives me crazy cuz they don't match.  I plan on buying another set and change them out when I get the change. Don't buy. Btw I got the 6000k
B00327AZJO|2|Not upto the mark and not quality fit
B006QC36K2|5|Seller was great, worked with our home / POB mailing problem. This rack fits 2014 cross trek models so that's awesome...we love it
B000C2GIJS|5|used it 6 months ago. no leaks holding up great. wish it would of been a real gasket and not just RTV and some grouments. but works none the less
B006065BKW|5|GREAT
B00499FE72|5|The starter in my beloved 2003 GMC decided to finally and unexpectedly call it quits one day. After getting sick of having to get dropped off at work for a week, I decided to check here on Amazon for a replacement and found this on sale and with free overnight shipping. Lifesaver. Installation was a breeze and it works perfect.
B000ANOUHQ|3|The warmth is wonderful and welcoming but the seat cover slips off of office chair even with the two straps.
B003977N7O|5|Great product at a great price. And shipped ontime.
B007WU1HF8|5|Same bulbs that came with the 2006 Mazda Miata.  They lasted 9 years/120k before one burnt out.<br /><br />Replacing the driver's side bulb required removing the inner fender liner to get to it.  Unbolting and moving the wiper fluid reservoir eased access to the passenger side one from the top.  Make sure not to touch the glass part of the bulb when installing are they will burn out quickly.
B0073MF7L0|4|Fit kinda tight but was able to use the original rubber clamp brackets. A few spots in just 1 or 2 welds I kinda questioned but it Dosnt leak so far. Fittings all worked correctly and so far has kept my 1997 chevy k1500 much cooler. Overall happy with the radiator, especially for the price, just would have liked for it to come with a new aluminum cap as well.
B006LB9FFI|5|As advertise and prompt service.
B000CODH0E|5|Excellent product exactly what was advertised!
B00DRK7O18|5|Powerful. Lifts the trailer up with no problem. Wish it a two more lights though. I like the additional 4in extension.
B00BITKHHS|5|So far so good.
B00VKM3PSQ|2|too big for may car
B000CGEJXG|4|Good shocks, but was very disappointed when opening the second box, during shock replacement, to find that the shock boot was missing.
B000CO87ZE|5|Does what it is supposed to do.
B00CLX1KBM|5|arrived early, packaged well, good quality no complaints
B0002SRGW0|5|These adapters made the job easy.  They work great with the new spicer ball joints I got.  The removal cup included was not large enough to go around my factory upper ball joint,  though, during removal.  Fortunately,  there was a piece included with the ball joint press that worked for this.  I used this set with a non- otc press rented from oreilly. No issues with it working with that press.<br /><br />The cups do work perfect with the spicer ball joints for my jeep tj.<br /><br />This it is a must,  for installation. Not too necessary for removal but does help greatly.
B00NFFEJOA|5|Good item as advertised
B008H5UAY6|5|Worked great on my 4000 mile trip and looks good on bike.
B00AYKPKWE|5|Perfect fit for 2005 Accord.  Whiter than the rest of the car due to fading.
B00WYITCMS|5|Good quality, solid metal frame (not plastic!)
B0083H4SMI|5|Perfect fit in 2000 Silverado. Tried to repair the old one but it continued to fail. This solves the problem without frustration (other than removing the trim and popping out the old switch).
B0044AXPMW|5|good
B0041EBSX4|5|Very strong more then I thought
B00W0C9Y26|3|Fits nice, easy to install, but does leak where it mounts to the factory visor.
B0012GTVVA|5|Surprisingly easy to install.  Now I don't have to worry about the grand kids putting their hands through the screen door of my RV anymore.
B000NTHHTK|5|Perfect fit, easy installation. Pricey for a tiny piece of plastic. One recommendation, REMOVE &#34;KIT&#34; from the description as it is not a kit, it's a single nozzle.
B000BRCGZ4|1|way to small
B00OAD8BXQ|1|Arrived cracked an not working.
B00029WYDU|5|Great
B00SXEQF8G|2|Did not fit as promised.  Very thin material.  You get what you pay for!  I dont think this would hold up well or long to outside use.
B009TOCJYI|5|Omg I just love this
B003IK4IZ2|5|Worked better than expected. With very little die-grinding on a body floor drain hole it fit within a minuet or two. The bolt lug is 3/8&#34; brass, the insulator is hard plastic. The insulator is threaded with a lock nut, and has flats to prevent the connector from turning in the hole while tightening or loosening the lock nut. This is why I used a die-grinder to widen the hole only where the threads are. The hole was the same size as the flats.
B002GOLH50|4|Perfect new light and looks awesome with the Kuryakyn 5001 Constellation Driving Light Bar. Had to modify slightly in order to mount.
B00851NNBE|5|Love the LED lights. We replaced all the lights in our camper with LED and we love that we did. The previous bulbs made the covers so hot I was afraid the grandchildren would burn themselves. Not a problem with these, they stay cool and they take less energy to run.
B007666O3I|5|thx
B000W0RQ8C|5|Simple as that. This works. Looks great. Is solid. Locks and has a dust cover.<br />Couldn't be happier. This is part of my Range Rover Sport set up if that helps someone for sizing.<br /><br />I'm hoping the black powder coat holds up and doesn't scratch off, but that would apply to any black hitch pin. You buy black to match your hitch!
B00KJ8C1AK|4|not too difficult in the driveway but a spring compressor definitely was a help.  When leveling a 2500 Dodge, the truck is already high so you need very tall jack stands to get enough elevation to drop the axle low enough to remove and replace the spring. The Passanger side spacer didn't line up as well as the driver side and a few modifications were necessary.  I had to rotate it and drill new pilot holes for the bolt so that the alignment notches were centered.  Also the spring had to be rotated 90' due to the new angle.  Not a bad product. good quality material and hardware.  Watching a youtube video helps a lot.
B00GZLEM48|5|Great product, installed these in the cup holders on my golf cart and they work great.
B001EOV45G|5|This is a nice subtle hitch cover and it's great how it stays attached with the &#34;safety strap&#34; when you need to use the hitch. It's made out of thick rubber which should protect shins and whatnot when they ultimately bump into it. I mounted mine the way it's oriented in the photo so it rests on whatever is inserted into the hitch as opposed to hanging down towards the road.
B001DNM0AG|5|These things work great
B00IP6D2Y2|5|Really dark, but I love the way they look. Definitely recommend getting some fog lights when using these. It's the only way you can see at night....lol, but true!
B0042GI4GA|5|The shipping on this was amazingly fast. I had not been able to lower or raise my windows for months. This part solved the problem. I am very happy with this purchase.
B001NZX5B2|5|Sparked by truck right up!
B001TMCUIS|5|Fit perfect and easy to install.
B000GQA8DC|5|Love it!
B003CEFJ2A|2|Poor quality zipper breaks after a few uses and color fades quickly.
B00KEKX85A|1|Too big
B00PK1P8OW|4|Thanks
B00CDSHXV6|5|good quality at affordable price
B00559VRDU|5|Worked great on my Grand Prix GXP.  You definitely need the other adapter for the wiring harness (ACDelco 19257603).  Super easy to replace.
B00SC6ZRP2|5|It's Great , no more digging in the seat all cars should have 1-2-4-6-8 I love it
B0028JQYSS|5|Tank you
B00QG6DYX2|4|Got these for my wife's car and then got myself a more basic pair. These have a little bedazzled ball on each end that look nice and are much &#34;prettier&#34; than the utilitarian version I got for my car. That said, great little idea and car organizing piece of equipment.
B00J8QT9RC|5|Short Story EXCELLENT
B00092893E|5|good
B00PE5A3PS|5|Great
B00R3XT7RY|3|Smaller than anticipated. Works well. Easy to install.
B011MF3SBO|5|👍
B0117QXHHI|5|As described.
B005G3XFW6|5|no limit. Instructions about what are effective firearms. Official ID. what else do you need?
B000C9OVIQ|5|loved it
B000UOBIZC|5|They work great for supporting the levelers on the trailer.
B00B7LS6VQ|5|works great. If you don't have this, you don't know what you are missing. Definitely makes it easy to store smaller items that would otherwise roll over as you drive through turns. It is also very good at holding things within the enclosed space. Highly recommended
B0002UEOLO|5|excellent
B00VAVVLBA|2|Replaced my old units with these, I was hoping to regain new factory ride; ride is even more spongy than before replacement.
B000W3RU9Y|5|I'm not going to pronounce myself as a bungee cord specialist, but these seem pretty nice as far as cords go. I've always had the rubber ones that are decent but tend to crack after years of stretching. This type feels more like an exercise band, with a round fabric-like body, hooks are sturdy and average size. These seem pretty tough and should hopefully withstand nature as well as be usable for a long time. The one I have outside is holding my garbage can closed so the a-hole band of raccoons doesn't keep ravaging my trash. So far, so good! I'll update if anything changes, but definitely recommend these as they seem very high quality.
B0002L6UDI|5|It's good.
B007FTP0WC|3|would of been cool to have some kind of letter \\" for best results \\"  ,( plain envelope and sticker.).... at least Thanks note. whatever, got lucky and don't need to reorder, be careful purchasers!!!!
B002BE6VIS|5|WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY IT THE STIG
B0022ZH2PC|5|Direct press-in replacement for my yzf600r. Correct diameters and good solid feel to the bearings.<br />Have used these for the past 40,000 mi through rain and salted roads (and of course some nice days too!). Replacing just for preventive maintenance, as the ones I just removed still rotate smoothly, though the seals have worn out. OEM Yamaha parts only made it to 20k...that days something about how good these are.<br />Would/will definitely buy again.
B0043PSK00|5|Worked great.
B004DRYQ3I|1|I received them on time. But one of the assembly is defective. Already emailed the seller. See how it goes.
B00ZM78H2E|5|I bought this for my husband. He loves it. Fit is great and the graphics are really cool. You only really notice the flames until you get in a certain light and then you see the skulls, almost holographic.
B00CFQRB6I|5|great product
B00029WYVW|5|Easy to use
B000C6WLIQ|4|These are good disks!. They were hard to install but I don't no different from the other ones I have put on my Hondas. It was difficult to get them around the knuckle. They do wear excellent.
B003YMPR22|5|Work as they should, no issues. Great price.
B0002YUQ4E|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00710481Y|5|Everything is great
B00MAGHM9E|5|Works great fits very nice.....
B00EZZVI7U|4|Great light for the price.  A translucent cover would have made it a 5 star product.
B00UZYHYRS|5|Easy to install!
B00573N36S|5|cute and effective :)
B0039538RK|5|GM original equipment to your door step, fast delivery, and fair pricing
B003O7775W|5|Works very well on my virago 1100
B0000AYECO|5|A+
B00WQI3LPU|5|Bulbs came as presented and I installed with no problem.
B00B5ZY07I|5|Perfectly fits my new Honda Civic!
B00GXRLGZW|5|love them
B001HATY36|5|Very sturdy and can't be pried off like the bar style
B000QUY0IW|5|It arrived on time and worked as expected.
B0007LZI8G|5|Living on a long gravel driveway an unprotected ball gathers dust, and  rust and these covers protect perfectly.  Decent  price too plus I didn't  have to drive all over to find them.
B0083AEVYA|5|The mirror performed as desired and having the compass back is a big plus - missed it when original mirror failed
B0030GDMBK|5|What I wanted.
B00S15UFE2|5|Quality was much better than anticipated and worth the price.  So happy I shopped on Amazon and found this umbrella.
B000IY819A|4|These rotors seem to be good so far.  I'll give them another review in a year or so when I see how the &#34;e-coating&#34; has held up to Cleveland winter.  So far (1 month), no rust and good stopping ability.  I used Wagner ceramic brake pads and Ford Motorcraft brake calipers on my rear brakes.  2004 F-150 FX4.
B00P8FP2BY|5|GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE!
B00AFW0HSS|4|I really did like this product but it seemed like it had buff marks in certain parts of the trim. Otherwise it fits and looks really nice.
B00HJDY6PG|5|fit perfect works great have used it often satisfied
B00J5KRUHM|5|Holds well, sturdy. Perfect size. Great for traveling.
B00199FDBC|5|Denso is the best sensor
B001NZM6UI|4|At first it wasn't working as well but now it works fine. Although I don't know if it will keep working. So far so good though. I guess I just had to break it in.
B00BPMCQSQ|5|Hard to find at my local auto shop and a must have if you have an older vehicle, or like me, leave your older gasoline lawn equipment outside.  Quick spray and the wires are dried and engine is going.
B00CJUW3HW|5|Love it! I had no issues with adhering it to my window.
B007JW8ROS|5|VERY CUTE ...
B00SYF5BWK|5|Excellent quality
B0098DCZ4E|5|Just got mine with some extra ones also. There good quality for the price to :)
B00RE4HZOO|5|thank you i like it
B0050EEECQ|5|Light fit right into the rv fridge works great lot brighter than the original one
B00F7H08DK|5|This decal works very well and very durable. Goes on very easy without a lot of air bubbles. The price is great as well.
B00UL3ET4E|5|Fast service,excellent product
B00390BS7C|5|Absolutely needed to get the O2 sensor off a Chevy Venture unless your wrist is tripple jointed.  The puller is solid metal and worked great.
B000IHWEWM|5|It came quickly and as described.  I've used it on some tough motorcycle bolts on a bike I haven't use in 12 years and it worked like a charm.
B0010B00IA|5|runs a slow cool but great for trips
B000BTO0E2|5|good
B000C5HK88|5|Fit perfectly!!
B000LQ78YY|5|Perception of quality was better than many of the reviews.  Had no problem opening/closing the housing.  Problem with too small battery holder must have been resolved, because putting in Duracell Brand AAA cells was no issue.  Dealt with 'phantom load' discharge problem by putting small slip of paper (cut from a business card) between one battery terminal and battery.  Included warning note in each pouch to remind user to pull slip out before using, a 5 second task.  There is an O-ring seal around the top lens; probably OK for bad weather but not for submergence.  Brighter than some views suggested, but you may want to position lens into the direction of traffic.
B000VKZNZG|3|I recieved the part on time it is looking real good. But i did not install it as yet, i like what i see.
B00VR4PFY4|5|Ok
B003LT71QS|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B000C9C4DK|4|Form fit and function all good.
B00EVQHYOE|4|Arrived perfectly and on time.  Horn is way too high pitched for what I want.  I installed it and will keep it until I can find another reasonably priced horn set with a lower pitch.
B000C9FEJ6|5|Quality
B00L2X2KYI|3|I like the concept over the cylinder type projectors that you have to drill holes for but there are a few issues. I have an 08 fx35 and they are not a direct fit, they will fit with a little modifying. First the spade wire connectors are too wide, I had the take a pair of scissors and cut them down to fit in the plug.<br />The projectors themselves work well, however when the doors are fully opened they are not fully squared with the car. What I mean is that they project at 1:00 rather than 12:00 if that makes sense, I would think like the other types I've had they would be at 12:00 as they would look much better. On another note, you do not have to take the door panels off to install, they can be done by just releasing the bottom 2-4 tabs. I hope this helps.
B00EUICPJC|5|I bought this for my new school. It is just as it seems on the photo.
B002XL2IG8|5|Excellent fit
B0070YZUU4|5|I ordered two of these and had issues with them lighting properly.  I contacted customer service and they promptly sent me two  replacement ones super fast and they worked awesome.  The kids loved them and the customer service was fast and super friendly!!  Recommend this product and two thumbs up to such wonderful  customer service !!
B00YB5GAEA|1|Died on it's 3rd ride. It survived one wet ride, but not the second. I bought it specifically for it's size/weight, but if it doesn't work it's just dead weight.<br /><br />Pros: Small(ish)... could still be smaller, positive feedback when you click it on/change modes, micro usb rechargeable so the most common phone charging cables will work, simple and quick to pop on/off the bike<br /><br />Cons: apparently not waterproof, could be smaller/lighter, it says it's angled properly to make it horizontal when installing on a seatpost (which is angled) but I didn't notice any angling.
B00KWJ7K8E|5|i recommend this item.
B00KC39BE6|4|I am very satisfied with with the ExpertPower EXP12200 battery. It works well with my Xantrex Xpower Powerpack 400 Plus unit.
B000S2O4KM|5|Very happy with easy install and performance.
B00CBTRMZ4|5|Easy, compact, sturdy and works great.  The price was perfect too.  Couldn't be happier.
B00480FIEG|4|First of all the bulb lights up white but that's only if you look closely at the right angle as shown in the description picture on amazon<br /><br />However these will never look xenon or HID white like BMW, AUDI, ACURA, etc and most new cars<br /><br />If you bought these bulbs you were probably looking for a straight up white look , as white as a cloud and these aren't for that so look elsewhere for an HID kit<br /><br />As for usability these are great, the light up the road extremely well and aren't blinding so 10/10 for that
B002G3OG6S|5|These wipers fit my 2007 A4 Quatro, but they might not fit yours. Audi used at least two different styles of Bosch wipers on the A4 from 2003-08 and there is a ton of confusion about which is the right one for which vehicle. Adding to the confusion, the product image on this page is not accurate, unless Amazon has since fixed it (I alerted them and sent a link to the correct image).<br /><br />In the meantime, see the attached photos. They include an accurate product image, instructions and the car models listed on the box. NOTE THAT SOME ARE FOLLOWED BY A RANGE OF MM-YY DATE RANGES. The manufacturer changed the wiper used on these models in the middle of the year.<br /><br />Note: These wipers are asymmetric; one is meant to go on the left side of the car, the other on the right. I recommend figuring it out before removing the old wipers, then changing them one at a time so you can look at the second one to figure out how to attach the first.<br /><br />These wipers are great, once you find the right ones. Well worth 5 stars. It took me two attempts. Hopefully this review will help you get it right on the first try.
B001C9I6GI|5|I couldn't believe the price!! They fit perfect and were very easy to install. Boxes came with seal of inspection on the boxes. No more shimmy when I come to a stop!! Thank you!!
B00T3TK3EW|4|Good fan for the price. Good puller, must switch the wires to get an effective pusher. I have it cooling a 4 wheeler and works great
B00YHKJNTS|3|I needed to pull wipers for a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The tool was not quite large enough to fit over the stud. I could get just a bit of grip, so I was able to make it work. One of the feet did bend- it is a light weight/duty tool.
B006B3C3XC|5|great one i like it
B000X21WRU|2|The other photos here have the same problem I have with my liner. Curing of the edges and it doesn't wanna stay in the same spot. It moves around and gets bunched up in corners.
B0009PYW3W|5|super strong.  keeps it's elasticity.
B003XGYDE2|5|I use it for my RV, awesome
B00VYNDSOM|1|This did not fit my acura tl 2008 like it said it would.
B001QV6KUQ|5|Bought for my 96 tacoma, they are 555 engraved, look high quality and have a hole for a grease zerk. Steering is nice and tight now, I would recommend these over moog, it's a better design with no spring inside. Install was almost easy, needed some special tools. I canot speak for its longevity but I have confidence in this product. The only odd thing I encountered is one had a blue boot and one had a black boot, different p/n, one left one right, but who cares about the boot color.
B00FH8P1DG|5|good
B0073RYG1W|3|everything works great but when applying the left turn signal every single light from the hitch light lights up.
B00D9C2CDO|5|works great even without cross bars on my roof rack
B00BE9F8FS|5|Looks awesome on my hard hat! !
B00LQW3COW|1|A bit bulky and the cables were too thin. The screen is a bit confusing, you always have to wait to be able to read everything. And if the battery is very low you can not start your vehicle. My cousin had his battery dead and it would not start it!
B00BT1XWRW|1|Not any good as vehicle decal
B00GZ743XW|3|One ballast gave up, swapped it out with same ballast from high beam, to lazy to order another or complain.
B000C55SV4|5|I PUT THIS ON TO REPLACE THE OLD Rotted out ONE- I DIDNT EXPECT any DIFFERENCE- but oh boy was I wrong!  Ford Explorer feels more in control now and no more vibration! Big difference! Should have done this sooner!
B00KI367F6|5|Worked perfect for my 07 rxp 215
B004ZF3KA8|5|Great kits for the price and everything.
B001F212OK|5|Works perfectly. Glad to have it!
B000PWWPCY|5|Just like stock.
B007V64NMM|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B00G4S4896|1|Very disappointed in this product, purchased steel gray color. This color is much much darker then the original color, it's nearly black!!
B001DC85E2|5|I had this ash tray for 12 years... until some idiot broke into my car last weekend and stole it!  I'm so glad Bell still makes these, as it probably would've lasted me another 12 years with no problem.  I love that I can snuff out my cigarette easily with the small hole next to the grates.  Emptying it, is super easy too, because the metal just inside the lid where you put out your cigarette pops right out.  I don't even want to bother looking at the reviews of all of the other ash trays, in search of something different, when I know this is the BEST!
B004KEIFTK|5|Thank you much the tool was very effective and I have the job done
B0028JPECA|5|If you have a 12v/cigarette lighter socket where you know that having the 2 ports on this will be easy to access, then you can't go wrong with this item. Although very cheap in price it is solid quality and works very well. I have a 12 year old car with only one socket near my center arm rest and my gadgets work very well using this.
B001F85OUM|5|// , I can confirm that this works with a Ninja EX250F, and that the installation takes less than 15 minutes.
B00EVMT6A8|5|This is a great safety addition to vehicles that lack blind spot mirrors. I have a 2014 Mazda6 which has electronic blind spot indicators - but I added these mirrors for that visual confirmation as well.<br />They are very clear and allow you to really see a great deal more of your blind spots. They do take a little while to get used to; understanding distance between objects being the biggest adjustment.<br />They simply stick on with their pre-mounted adhesive patches - and that's it. These do not move as the product title would suggest. They stick firmly where you put them - so be sure to test where you want them before you peel off the adhesive backing.<br />These are inexpensive and add a lot of safety - get them!
B00HVVVEYM|5|Wonderful quality.  We made a inside frame of PVC pipe- just to hold it's shape. You don't really need to do this, when filled, the bag will hold its shape nicely.  Nice heavy material.  We are using our own straps just for extra security.
B00UA4RL0I|2|This clay is really old and dry be aware
B00279BFCY|5|Delivered as expected.
B005ZWE0NG|5|High quality and I love them!!
B00IJP614W|4|GOOD
B000S2QWFC|5|The product is installed and works fine
B00DIIL6D6|3|Very good product and worked well for us during our 7 days of travel, however pockets started u weaving and coming apart which made it difficult to store items in the pockets.
B000E267JC|3|This stuff is ok if you don't mind your engine compartment looking a little wonky and unkempt.  It would be ok if the lines you are using it for are perfectly straight with no bends at all but this stuff kinks when you try to make it go around a corner.
B00REJXL88|5|Great fit on my 2011 GMC Sierra extended cab 6ft standard bed. easy install! looks awesome
B00VO035ZW|1|Cheaply made. Mirror broke on maiden voyage. Just from the wind hitting it.
B001E4E0ZW|5|IT was I ordered it works well on c6 thank you
B0002MB7IA|4|Rust easy
B00133L1DS|5|Not plug and play for g8 gt. I snipped parts of connector and now works for me. Just be cautious and ask ahead of ordering.
B000C9OT2O|5|Excellent.
B00M9MEM74|5|Works well. Quick shipping. Great price.
B00CE6OXY2|1|No good plastic and did not stick on wastel of money
B003UM7B98|5|Gift to son who says he loves it.  If he's happy, so am I.
B005FJ4M78|5|For the price, kick ass
B00076FN9A|3|Good starter helmet.
B009GO6CYO|4|Excellent. So much easier<br /> Takes less muscle.
B010R0JSK0|5|This was the most complete TH350 rebuild kit I was able to find. It is a collection of high quality, Made in USA materials. It even includes needle bearings. More expensive than some other kits but highly recommended if you want to have peace of mind during your rebuild.
B000FIXQXK|5|Used it on gun screws. So far, they have not loosened again yet.
B00BZQQTNA|5|Easy and simple instructions.  Works like a champ!
B001HLFWXQ|3|Straps are a little too long and I wish they have two little straps to go around each metal bar of the headrest as opposed to just the one big one. Aside from those issues (and I just double wrapped the longer straps around each metal bar twice before connecting them which is only a minor issue), the fake leather actually looks read and the overall bag is nice and goes with my black leather interior.
B00062YBU2|5|Fits, works, what else to say?  It is an edelbrock and fit directly onto the existing edlebrock air cleaner housing on top of the Ford 351 engine.
B00IM39A6M|5|Great deal!
B002EPSF7E|5|It works every time... and let's you remove having to get under the car/truck/van to let the oil drain out..... I'd say, &#34;Get one of these&#34;
B00V8JRF4G|4|Use these to re-run alternator and start wires. Great ends, very durable, hard to crimp down, but that just shows the excellence of the product and I know the wires wont slip back out.
B001Q8DMA0|5|works great for drying
B00BFDG06E|5|Fits perfectly. In fact, it seems to be better quality than the original.
B01256RQ3A|1|Flag is backwards. If the creator new anything about hanging a flag properly and made this correctly I'd buy a bunch.
B005FKLQVC|5|I needed to replace the rotors and pads on my 2007 335i. Every where I called gave me an estimate not under $700. I decided to go with these after reading the reviews from others who have purchased these. I can't say that I was disappointed. I love the way they look and they're stopping power is just as good or better than the more expensive OEM BMW parts, and they come with the sensors!! I will buy this brand again!
B000M27XHE|5|not designed to be a stock replacement. i had to modify the throttle bracket, and i bypassed the EGR. it is a great intake.
B003TTL0TE|2|I've used this wash mitt twice now and while it does a great job holding a lot of water for washing, the seam had already started separating on the side of the mitt where my thumb goes. I probably just got a mitt that had a bad sewing issue from the factory which caused it to come apart so easily, but this shouldn't happen. Luckily they are fairly cheap and I did order two, so hopefully the second one holds up better!
B00LO0M918|5|Great light for the money no need to worry about it draining your battery.
B008CF7VRU|5|Received item quicker than I expected. Very happy with my purchase and the seller.
B00F68GMJ4|5|I had it installed by my Honda dealer, they had never seen it --- and they all thought it was very cool!
B005PRJFMW|5|Fits absolutely perfect
B0021URQSQ|3|Be advised that the blanket is not 6' X 8'. The actual size is 5'-8&#34; X 7'-8&#34;, which is clearly stated on the package I received. However, it is not stated anywhere on Amazon which would inform a buyer about this known fact. Perhaps the 4&#34; is not a big deal for most applications, but that should be for the buyer to decide, given the information. It was a big deal for my application, for which there was insufficient time to return/exchange, so I had to scramble and sew in a small section with kevlar thread. I do take some blame though since I'm not using it as a welding blanket in the first place.<br />The product appears to be well manufactured, and is relatively heavy gauge.
B00AQ372XE|1|Color was not accurately represented or descibed
B003R7HX0I|5|Excellent replacement, fit like a glove and easy to install in my 2012 GMC Sierra
B00KSDKWZ2|5|loved it and its very easy to use and looks good
B00B51EEYQ|5|great
B0007LZI8G|5|Keeps grease on ball where it belongs.....beats tieing up the ball with a plastic bag
B000C2YC6O|5|perfect fit for the 94 accord 4cyl.
B00CRL2B02|5|Good quality camera and a good price. Make sure you get a decent quality monitor in order to get the full benefit from the camera.
B004VF48YO|5|we really like this antenna, it's compact in height so we don't have to worry about forgetting to wind it down and get snapped off.  The reception has been great so far.
B00D1CQVIY|5|A great supplement part for my THH 20&#34; Dual Row High Power 126w LED Light Bar.  Would not put that unit on without a relay system like this one.  Easy to install.  Even has leads for a second light in the future.
B001NZ0SP8|5|Works perfectly!!!!  If you have an AC fan on a ford that suddenly looses one or more fan speeds.  It isn't the motor, the switch.  It is more than likely this particular part right here.  My wife's 2008 Ford Expedition lost the low fan speed one day.  Then all the sudden the med/low setting quit as well.  Well ya can't drive around with med/high and high fan on all the time.  So I did some research.  I found this little piece that controls the fan speed.  It is located behind the glove box.  With a little finesse it can be changed out in about 10 min.  The repair required just simple tools.  A phillips head screw driver and I think a 9 or 10mm socket and small ratchet.  Just unplug the old one and plug in the new one.  Cheap easy fix.  I'm sure the dealer would have charged 100s for this repair.
B00B0GDQBI|2|Does not stick or shape very well, removed all of it. Keeps coming off of curved areas. Excellent for flat areas. Just as a review said &#34;more of a brown than gold&#34;. The thinner,  the better (2D), this is just too thick - and heat makes it worst.
B00NVR9FAK|5|Great product; good quality, exceed expectation. I had a very pleasant experience of acquiring an excellent product from a respectable seller
B006IWA6OE|5|This was also installed by my Honda dealership who did not even know this option exsisted.  Updating the family sedan for the teenager's first car.  Everyone agrees that this is the coolest addition to the car.  Fits perfectly, looks like it belongs, and really updated a 2005 model to current status.
B006H33ZEC|5|Awesome lights put them on my atv install was a breeze no cutting wires plug and play. Lights are very bright for trail riding and there just what every one wants in the darkness of the night.
B000E2CVIS|5|Great price for my Concours 2013.
B000CRDLCU|5|Replaced the worn out tensioner on my Case 480LL Landscape Loader perfectly. O.E. part is no longer available and this the same replacement part Case sells for $60 more
B009EYHH3Q|4|rotax
B00JMK0GIU|4|:-)
B000SL0R9K|5|Useful to keep in our family automobile... Just in case.
B0041MVQ4M|5|Proper care these will last through several details. Love each level of this pad!
B00DP514P2|5|Good
B000FRS7QC|5|Outstanding remanufactured fuel injectors. The one I received was a DENSO and funny enough like the other reviewer had my 2001 Sequoia up an running within an hour. This came with all of the O-rings (including a ring for the electrical connector), but I also bought a four sets of O-rings on the same order so I could replace all of the seals on that fuel rail (just in case). Saved a TON of money by doing this myself. I believe the injector was in my hands 1 and half days after my order. I hope I don't need another, but if I do I will buy again!.
B003SS62PS|1|LOUD, like having a wee jet engine in your space.<br /><br />It's floppy and can't hold it's &#34;head up&#34;.  I'm going to have to monkey around with the screws and whatnot.<br /><br />So loud and at 4' I can't feel any air movement.
B00GSAUHB8|3|I decided to return this item. I found folding it up was much more difficult than similar sun protectors. I thought the extra material to push up into the corners would offer more protection but they would not stay in place. Overall I found the product too bulky and difficult to handle.
B00RJAOJS8|1|very good worked out well,easy directions
B00AGPF1LM|3|Wish parts of it was shipped better it came bent on the top edge and was hard for the tape to stick.
B00K03WRYO|5|Just installed in my wife's  scion xb . let's  how things go.
B005M226UI|5|it works & it fit perfect
B00FP0FB1S|1|this is the most disappointing item i ever purchased.  These air freshners you buy in store for 2.99 not 5.83.  Dont Buy
B00Y4NHOGW|4|Received part in a timely manner, but it was the wrong part.
B000765MHI|5|This fan works amazingly well.  I bought it for my poor daughter who does not have working A/C in her car and this keeps her from sweating to death.  After seeing how well it works, she bought one for her boyfriend.
B00HLW18T2|1|Very dissapointed. The description states that you get 2 lights but I only recieved 1 light..... so yeah......
B00319JQLQ|5|Great $$$ Saver.  Worked perfectly with my 2000 Saturn SL1.
B000COMX3Q|1|Broke easily.
B00TQZN5PW|5|Easy installation, awesome sounding engine now with higher rev and better gas mileage....and did I mention how good it looks under the hood on my 2014 Ram 1500 Pentastar V-6. Definitely would recommend to the next guy or gal.
B002XM3IP2|5|GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
B00HW79EBA|5|Best sticker ever. Every time I drive down the street my muffler whistles &#34;the British are coming&#34;. My bumper is now 100% bullet proof, dictator proof, vegetarian proof and terrorist proof. My life was full before this sticker came into my life. My car tells Shia to &#34;just do it&#34;. At night the eagle hunts criminals and PETA members. Using the power of freedoms my car can now literally fly. Not only has my car improved, but ever since this sticker came to the door in the mail my life has bettered 10x. I now have a country accent and a 10&#34; male genital organ. I can power clean 1000 and bench your fat mother-in-law. Instead of rain, bud light falls from the sky in perfect streams into open cups, and the clouds around my house are in the shapes of football. My girlfriends breasts have gone from a B cup to a D cup. My dog ate my girlfriends cat, BEST. STICKER. EVER.
B0041QCAHA|5|Looks cool and better than the black version
B000CSD322|5|Wix filters are a great product and I've used them for years on all my yard equipment. Buy this filter and you won't be disappointed.
B0006303DK|3|Does the job, but would like to see a little thicker metal on the flange and longer bolts
B000P6VMEC|5|versatile strong product
B00KVL4QOE|2|This product does what is was designed for,  but I've only had it a short while and the thin fabric around the edges is peeling off and leaving little bits all over my dashboard.
B00UZE8878|5|My favorite chemical guys soap!
B000JZGMSU|1|The seller lied to me. This does not fit on my 2003 Camry.
B0000AY9W6|5|Great price!
B000C97692|1|broke within a week
B00JHB5NJQ|5|The bulbs worked great and looked great, just happened to be illegal in my state.
B00R8QGITG|5|Disconnected battery and jumped the 2003 Highlander Limited 3 times; pumped a tire. All gone well. I like it.
B002PR8ZXK|5|Just what my compressor needed.
B004AGH2JW|4|The wheels spacers are high quality and fit my 2004 TOYOTA MATRIX great. The center bore piece is a separate piece than the spacer itself, which you cant really tell in the picture but its made of the same material and slides together very snugly. The wheel studs were too long to get into my hub without disassembling the entire hub. This was done on the rear wheels with disc brakes. Drum brakes probably wont have this problem.<br />Overall the item is top notch high quality!
B00S05MSRK|5|So convenient, keeps everything intact and undamaged.  Folds flat when not in use but really I have mine ready to go because I use it  often.  Well designed and holds up well.
B006V7TBBA|5|Love these lights on my truck. Been on there for over a year in the weather and snow and not a single problem. Would totally buy again.
B00O92T1NC|5|works great. I got 2 of these.
B00ODG78WU|5|Works great
B0002TDUW4|5|COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
B00550MXKA|5|Fits my 2014 Honda Civic Si perfectly and it does its job.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Great product and fits my 2007 Wrangler like a glove!
B010H52OXS|5|I love It!  It keeps my purchases hidden well. The color matches the interior.
B00R6M00DM|5|Perfect Fit and a true knee saver.
B00KHX6WMU|5|As advertised, great deal on a new key fob.
B0002KKII2|5|Well built, good quality!
B0010HNQ1M|5|perfect fit, no leaks
B002UJVNFA|1|Poor quality
B006N9CPFK|1|These are garbage.  Replace before a trip from Florida to Michigan, and they were making noise by Louisville, Kentucky.
B00NLR2Y76|5|My husband has one and liked it so I ordered one. I'm happy with the fit even with my glasses. It comes with a sun shield but I'm planning to order an extra one in yellow/amber.
B00651CC2W|3|Did not fit my 1995 F250, but am going to try to make it work.
B004I0FFUS|5|Good quality
B006TMLQW4|5|Excellent. Even had replacement bulb.
B003JEISI0|5|Looks nice.
B00801RG08|5|Excellent struts. Worked great on my Malibu 06. The seller was also very good at working out some minor issues I had with a previous order. Highly reocmmended.
B00067BV96|3|The first set I got, the colors didn't match. One was a good yellow, the other was sorta orangey. One bulb in this set also died after 8 months. However, I contacted PIAA and they sent me another set of bulbs, no questions asked. The color match on the new bulbs is good. So 3 stars for now - bulb color and lifetime were no good, but great customer service.<br /><br />I will update this review after I've run the new bulbs for a year or until one burns out.
B000FSADEA|5|Have had this antenna for a few years now, it's held up great.  I purchased a magnet mount for it.  Used a SWR meeter to tune the antenna (needs to be done) and performs basically flat on all channels.
B0034GY8J6|5|Just what i needed for the 3 Mitsubishi our family own. Great alternative to the OEM SP-III at a great price.
B00UI3U98C|1|Despite the great reviews from others, I had a much different experience.  Auto-Chem has some great products - their 3 in 1 (640-016) is incredible (especially on dark colors)  - but this was awful.  I used my Griots Garage detailing mist spray for the lubricant, which I've used for every clay bar product I've ever bought - and this mitt left terrible &#34;clay&#34; residue all over ever panel that was not easy to remove.  It also did not do well at removing small tar spots which all clay bar products do effortlessly.  It's possible the lubricant was at least part of the problem; but you shouldn't have to buy a special lubricant for a $35 mitt.  If you must use a special lube, it should be packaged and sold as a &#34;kit&#34; with it included.
B0010DW5ZO|5|Easy to install
B001U5AP8Q|5|This product is a must.  Have used over 3 times. It absolutely does what is says, got rid of the mildew smell in my RV.
B00GJKXW8M|5|I bought 2 and mounted them on a tractor.  They work great. Neat small dimension light putting out alot of light!
B00BMN30HY|5|plenty of wire for project
B000E63MSC|4|Works great, for the money!
B007055FLW|5|Fit like it should, had to adjust motor height in order to get to slip through the long stud bolt on engine mount bracket... Car runs smooth again! Thanks!
B009D62C4Y|5|Works and fits perfect.
B0012QP7EA|5|Works as advertised.  Can't get too excited over a window switch.  Will update if anything fails.
B00XZ9PJUO|5|Fit my personal needs perfect 👌. Was on time ⌚
B003721C0U|5|EXACT Fit, not problems. Super Buy.
B000JK2D06|4|CAP  WAS  LOOSE  WHEN  DELIVERED  LOST  SOME  BUT  WAX  IS  WHAT  PEOPLE  SAY  , IT  IS  GOOD  .
B00N7CPFRQ|5|Love this device!
B00KYJTPPS|5|Really nice sunshade, the fit is perfect, better then any I have ever bought.
B00AMEL2WE|5|Great product  bought 2 one for each head
B005NLQAHS|3|Worked for a few minutes, The unit stopped communicating with ECU and only shows red light. Will try one replacement and post after getting the second unit. Did work as described before ceasing to function.
B007PP26BE|3|Haven't used them, ordered the wrong size. Seemed like a deal. Hopefully can use them on another project
B00CFM9QLA|5|real cool!
B002YTHZL2|5|Awesome products...thanks
B00O3QUZSE|5|fits perfect!
B002ZBWKAU|5|Best one I have purchased for car tire inflation. I recommend it highly AAA+++
B000VU5IRE|4|Good product, good value, Great Service.  But I invested much time looking for the quite small Wire Terminals, which DO NOT come with this &#34;Micro&#34; Relay Socket. Finally found the terminals at cycleterminal dotcom. But I'd have gladly paid more for the complete setup.<br /><br />I purchased 2 of these & they ganged together nicely. I liked the fact that I can wire & mount the Socket Base, & the Relay simply plug in. More professional (like OEM Auto Makers). For my application it was better  than a pre-wired Relay & /or a Relay that has a mount tab built in.
B001KQD7XA|1|Part failed in one month.  Not happy.
B00NOAJK1S|5|Great drl's, it's been a while now and still going strong I like them a lot, not as good as hide but they are bright , very, very, bright!
B004N6LMP4|5|Ok
B005N53AM2|5|I live in AZ, where you need to drive with oven mitts in the summer. I use a sunshade in my windshield but that wasn't helping my steering wheel. I bought this and because of the material, it works great. It also is nice even if your hands get sweaty since it's a tough cloth material. If you live in Hell, or AZ, I highly suggest this!
B000IY8OBK|3|Build quality seems to be good so far, but as others have mentioned, the fit is not OEM. The most obvious is center coil wire (?). The OEM connector off of the distributor cap is 90 degrees, but this NGK one is straight. Like others have said, it looks awfully close to coming into contact with the underside of the hood. As far as the other wires, a couple of them seemed to be a little longer than the OEM set that came out as well.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I would dish out the extra $20 and buy the OEM Honda set.
B001OBCZDY|5|works great
B00SQX3LLI|4|As many have said, the adhesive is sub par. Easy fix, buy 3M tape. Lights work as described.  Would be 5 stars if adhesive was better but worth the money.
B004A0ZLSC|5|perfect fit
B00JZG9KFG|5|Service was fast and the light works great.
B00HHS4LKS|5|Best keychain!
B0076CLLPI|5|Quality vinyl. Happy with the product. Would recommend.

B00BFDG06E|5|Great quality.
B001ENN1QW|1|wrong colors
B00JSAB3MM|5|Placed in center of new Pacific Dually polished stainless steel wheel simulators. The emblems are inexpensive and look great.
B0002M79Q4|5|works great for tubing or skiing
B00YI3IGA6|5|Best sun shade
B000I111FO|1|Returned for a refund. Horrible product. Can hardly fit anything in the compartments, and the bottom won't stay flat. Useless.
B002QOYS42|5|Exactly what what I wanted.
B000EQTQX2|5|Good product has been on-time delivery<br /><br />Thank you،،،
B00QJRYMFC|5|Does as advertised. Don't need Wifi just the blue tooth will work. Easy to use.
B007RVQYPA|5|Strong lift, fit perfect, factory new.
B00KWGU71Y|3|Rather expensive price for a basic plastic plug that could have been purchased at a local hardware store.
