B005ZOBNOI|5|A nice fast read
1878424319|5|This book gave me good guidelines for dealing with others.  I take things to personal and this is helping me to change my ways.  With theis book I am acquiring new habits in dealing with those around me.
B000AMPZGC|5|I mistakenly bought this cd instead of the movie dvd.  However, I am sure that my daughter will like it anyway.
B00AQ3K8IU|4|It had s good story line but there was alot of repetition when it came to the hugging and kissing aspects of it.
B008TMA1LY|4|Fun game that keeps you wanting more. I'm not sure who is addicted more: me or my 5-year-old.  She loves that it's Hello Kitty and that there are other characters to choose from.  the only down side is that you cant upgrade to Kitty unless you pay to add hearts.
B0009S4IHY|5|I'm not going to rehash the story , the other reviewers did that well enough. The only thing I'm going to say is that this is one of funniest movies I've ever seen and after 20 viewings it still cracks me up. Just avoid the dub it's awful, the sub is where its at.
B00AIBZLVY|5|I really enjoy this film and am happy to have it in my collection at a great price and perfect shipping time
B0036OP0QQ|5|This Cd is truly a gem for any Whitney fan, I ordered it and was surprised at the content when it came, It has all of her finest songs in their orginal cd casings, I am playing this cd right now and I am truly enjoying it. I am so sorry that we lost her at such a early age, but her music will live on. Rest in Peace Queen Whitney
B00BXI0IHS|4|Do not be put off by the author's previous book.  This is nothing like her earlier and very famous work.  It is a  drama set in the 1800s about a highly intelligent and accomplished woman who lives an extraordinary life.  Through it one learns about the scientific advances of the time too making it an intelligent read.<br /><br />The novel is beautifully structured and starts off outlining the life of Alma's father who has lived a rags to riches life and then follows Alma's life through her cloistered beginnings to her interesting late adult life.<br /><br />I recommend it to people who are interested in good character studies that teach us something about what it is to be human and also to others who enjoy learning about the history of science.
B0072GPQNG|3|This movie is more about the people that the horse came into contact with then the horse itself. The ending is a happy one but because of the brutal war scenes and shots where the horse is being traumatized I would not recommend this film for children. I was actually put off by the many war scenes and of course war itself is disgusting.But I am a sucker for animals and I read ahead of time that the horse does not die so I went ahead and watched this. The acting was okay but you do to really get a sense of connection to any of the characters because they are in the horse's life so briefly.
B000TFHJJQ|4|One of Stallone's best!
B00BAYLQI0|5|The Impossible starring Oscar nominee, Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor will leave you in tears. This film is breathtaking and gut-wrenching to watch, make sure to have some tissues nearby. This incredible, heartfelt film just broke my heart. There is nothing like when strangers come together and the human spirit is tested. Naomi Watts is spellbinding and fearless as Maria, and I still can't believe she didn't win lead actress at the Oscars earlier this year. McGregor plays Watt's husband in the film and he turns out a solid performance as well. The Impossible is based on a true story, I also recommend watching the audio commentary which features the real Maria. I love, love, love this movie...it's powerful and so good for the soul. I highly recommend it!
B00BWBHIUG|2|I wasn't able to get the program to load on my Kindle so I removed it.

B0000640RX|5|He's back, M16's with attached Cruise Missile launchers blazing. Everyone's favourite kick-ass-bandanna wearing super hero/fashion guru is back in a fantastic box set of DVD's, digitally remastered to blow you AND the commies away in style whilst sticking to the original visions of the creator himself Ted Kotcheff. So now when John Rambo gets up close and personal, the improved sound effects mean you can too. <br /> Despite the addition of cut scenes, the impeccably original story remains intact. Disgraced Vietnam Veteran John Rambo is court marshalled for a crime he didn't commit and wages a \\"one man war\\" against both his former employers and the numerous bad guys he comes upon. 68 explosions, 90,000 rounds and 100 individual gun shot wounds to our hero later and we find ourselves on a cliff-hanger that would make Stanley Kubrick brick himself in suspense. It's so tense that it makes his later film classic \\"Cliffhanger\\" look like a muscley guy striding up some snowy hill for 2 hours. <br /> In an interview last year, Ted explained the crisis that the creatively exhausted writers faced for the eventual ending. He said: \\"Basically, the engineers were fresh out of blanks for the fake guns. This created a problem I had never thought I could face; ending a film without using a gun. Because of this, we created and filmed various endings and picked the one that worked best.\\" <br /> So for your pleasure and of course Rambo's, here are some of the endings you'll find on this DVD: <br /> <br />* Rambo is saved at the last minute from \\"The General\\" in his personal rocket Helicopter by his allies the Viet-Kong Nazis, who fire an ICBM, stolen from the Russians, at the helpless General. Our hero luckily jumps behind a barrel marked TNT and therefore survives the explosion and Nuclear fallout. <br /> <br />* Just before Rambo fires his semi-automatic cluster bomb launcher, he is abducted from behind by none other than Adolf Hitler himself who we find had framed his suicide and with the help of the Commies had lengthened his life-span. Our Hero is then imprisoned in Castle Von Volfenstien and is tested on constantly to find \\"80's action hero skin piercing bullets\\" but to no avail. Rambo fights them off barehandedly. This idea was not used as the production company were faced with a lawsuit from the makers of Wolfenstien 3D. <br /> <br />There is even a bonus music track by the European Wing of the Rambo fan club. The Association of Rambo Servicemen (Europe) or ARSE for short, sing the parody of Meat Loaf's \\"Rock and Roll Mercenaries.\\" What more could we ask for? <br /> So sit back, strap on your Bandanna that comes free in every set and enjoy the show.... <br /> <br />Xylophone.co.uk rating: 5/5 \\"An American Dream\\" <br />
B00005QK3W|5|It's not surprising that on his first album of all original material since wife Linda's death, Paul is exploring the darker side of the spectrum. \\"She's Given Up Talking\\", \\"Lonely Road\\"- many of these tunes would get airplay on alternative radio if someone else had penned them. But it's not all dark. \\"Tiny Bubble\\", \\"Your Way\\", and the title track are trademark McCartney pop masterpieces. This is the freshest album in Paul's output since 1989's \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\". All of the session musicians on the record are a good deal younger than Paul, and they give it a noticeable edge as well. A great album for Paul fans of all ages!
B00004STPT|4|This soundtrack goes along pretty much the same lines as Zimmer's &quot;The Rock&quot; soundtrack (I actually mistook this for it, when a friend in the office was playing the CD). It is professionally composed and  arranged - indeed, Hans has done his homework in music theory - but I still  feel both this and The Rock soundtracks lack character. The chords and  rhythms are all very contemporary and not very inspired.<br />If you like  boombastic and epical orchestral music, this is a good buy. In this  context, I could also recommend Conan the Barbarian soundtrack, composed by  Basil Poledouris. I find it more inspiring than this one.
B00H58VGIA|5|Great combination if historical facts embellished with fiction to create and amazing walk through A very tough era in the history of US History. The author brings the time and characters to life to tell this amazing story of brave women and early womenr's rights, as well as the central them of abolitionists in early 1800s.
B0015DROBO|3|Interesting characters but the plot and subplots were a little too dark for my taste. I'll have to do some lighter reading before I commit to the next book in the trilogy.
B000067FP8|5|This is an example of how to do a sequel right.. Good sequels are rare these days, the 80s was full of them. Its arguably better than the first... Brings back memories from my childhood, love it!
B009XWD02G|1|This sucks ass its a huge scam you cant download or play a song,it just makes fart sounds what ever you do dont download it.
B00CFA222M|5|This just goes to show how much better bad movies are than good movies. This is like the Troll 2 of special effects. Time to lighten the load, HAHAHAHAHA.
B003O86FMW|4|Suzanne Collins racks up another winner , as good as Hunger Games. Moving on to the third book in the series soon, very soon.
B00280LYIC|5|The Lightning Thief was quite a great book. It was cool during the parts of the Minotaur, the Medusa, the Arch, the Diner,the Underworld, and the zoo truck. I knew it was a great book. I already read the Sea of Monsters. I can't wait to read the Titans Curse.
B00984668E|5|A great, solid album by a great doom metal band! I love every song on here, no filler, all hard riffing killer.<br />If ancient druids listened to heavy metal they'd rock The Sword all day and night !
B00D7Z4GQY|4|This was a great book.. It will keep you interested and wanting more. The men in the book all have different secrets.
B000K7VHQE|5|Like RV with Robin Williams it was funny, outrageous, different in every aspect (dysfuntional families), and heartwarming in the end.
B00DA6YEKS|5|What a ride through storms & chasms. I loved this second book of the series and was sad to read the last page. I'm not a detailed reviewer, I hate spoilers, if you loved The Way of Kings, continue the journey with the characters and more with this edition. Wtg Mr Sanderson, another win!
B009NOGSQE|4|Always a good one!
B0015DROBO|3|Interesting story
B000S0DDG0|4|Great movie. I have watched it several times. Jennifer Hudson's performance was outstanding.
B000XUBFE2|5|I really like how the story was told from the viewpoint of death.  I like the imagery that was created as well. Definitely a tear-jerker!
B001TXWJ4M|5|This is such an amazing show, and an even better buy on blu ray.  If you're looking for a new show to watch, this is it.  Everything in this show, is perfectly executed thanks to Vince Gilligan and their two amazing lead actors.  I'm itching for it to come back in July 2013
B0046ECFRM|5|Very juicy and was drama the whole time! It always had me on the edge of my seat with who was dating who or who liked who. It was an adorable book and I recommend this book to anyone who loves cliche but not so cliche love stories! 游땘游땘
B00006DEFA|4|I have shown the original version of this movie many times over the years in my classroom as part of a unit on Mozart and was very familiar with the content of the movie.   This newer version contains scenes that were not in the original and I was not aware that scene 16 contains nudity until I showed it to my seventh graders-so beware!  By the way, this movie is unrated as there were no ratings for movies at that time-the original does contain some inappropriate language which I explain to my students that the use of this language helps to explain Mozart's behavior.
B007J4T2G8|5|Really good book. I couldn't put it down. I just ordered the second installment. Can't wait to finish it. Word
B000MNP2KI|5|Daniel and M are at it again  and perfect as usual.  One of the best Bonds since George Lazenby.  Amazon always comes through.

B00BAXFECK|4|Very interesting and beautifully written. Couldn't wait to get to the next page. It's a very intriguing story. It is most enjoyable.
1577312082|5|Eckhart Tolle is always worth watching or listening to for me. He has a very keen insight and wisdom into healthy ways of viewing the world and approaching life.
B003TSEEDY|5|This story is riveting and moving. It teaches a value while maintaining originality and truth. I couldn't imagine a greater read. I didn't put this book down till I read it all the way through. A true classic and a piece that will open your eyes and move you in so many ways.
074322454X|5|The recipient of this really liked it.

B00L9B7IKE|5|I loved this book. Kept me guessing. I couldn't keep it put down.
B007HJ9NBE|5|I enjoyed the movie very much it had a very good moral to the story. I would suggest watching it if you like dance and music.
B006NYQAJM|3|My son saved his money to purchase this lego funhouse and was a little let down by the small size. The pictures of course are a bit deceiving.<br />Other than that it took him about an hour to put it together.<br />It would be a much better value at 1/2 the price or less.
B0076DELIG|5|I love the Harry Bosch novels.  He's a wonderful character.  I like the way his daughter is maturing.  It had a good concept and a thread running through it to connect all the dots together.<br /><br />More please!
B0057A6GA6|4|I almost didn&apos;t get into this game. Picked it up as a freebie and almost immediately deleted it. Gave it another shot when I needed a break from fieldrunners and I&apos;m glad I did.\n\nI seems completely without frills and while it is pretty much as generic as tower defense gets you get a lot of levels, a lot of towers, and a lot of different creeps to kill in a solid, challenging package. \n\nThere are a lot of games attempting a new twist on tower defense games. Sometimes it&apos;s good to mix it up and play something simple. GRave defense might stick to the basics, but it does them right.
B007OLYQ4E|4|The movie is much like the book for the most part. The end (which I will not give away is completely different), and certain parts are different but reading the original is completely worth it!<br /><br />If I could immerse myself in the world of Tiffany's I would.
B00DFFHUUA|3|... there is a bad guy in the White House (imposter) and he makes the world a dangerous place to be.  The idea is rather interesting, the execution leaves something to be desired, and the editing was pretty bad.  I had trouble trying to keep the disparate parts of this movie in a proper timeline... there were some very awesome special fx/fighting scenes, particularly on the mountain venue,,, however, after all was said and done, it was a bit of a letdown...
B00R3DO58K|5|Being a Tolkien fan I have all 3 of the Hobbit movies. This is the best one and a good finale to the series.
B001ANSS5K|3|I previously read two of Green's book and loved them, so I thought I would try another. This one certainly started out good, but it quickly slowed down to a near halt. This lasted for most of the story. I found myself hoping it would pick up, but it never did. I finally just told myself that I must finish the book for two reasons 1) I still hoped the story would pick up 2) I didn't like leaving stories unfinished. So I read it, and it did pick up at the end, but most of the story was just so boring. All in all it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't my favorite. SPOILER ALERT: I did enjoy the journey to New York because I love in the part of NY Q and the gang went to. It's always nice to read about close to home.
B008P1EWIM|1|Zero stars would be more appropriate for this app. I purchased this app for 299 of my Amazon coins and I wish I hadn't. It crashes as soon as I open it and sends me to my alarm clock app. I am really upset with Apalon and would not suggest this app to anyone until Apalon puts out an update to fix this issue.

B00004T9VY|4|This is a great early album by Cat Stevens.  Songs like Wild World, Where Do the Children Play, and On the Road to Find Out are terrific.  While I'm reviewing this, I'd like to point out the reviews of someone named Barron Laycock(Labradorman).  He uses the same review for almost all of Cat's albums, just substituting in songs with each album.  He does the same thing for other artists, too.  This jerk got to be a Top 10 reviewer by being too lazy to do anything original.
B0088W6IMQ|5|A worthy successor to Stargate SG-1; was glad it was created - enjoyed the series as a whole; a few down moments, but overall very entertaining
B0007YMUZW|4|I thint Ryan should change his first name because people are always get him mistaken for bryan adams no wonder he a gave the concert goer his money back when he ask him to play summer of 69 but ryan should know to lighten up just a little though. I got lone cd of his rock and roll which i copied from the libary and i like it, it sounds like jeff buckley. This cd is a good one i listen to it in it entirely on his website. It also is pretty good for a double and the price is not bad. It sounds like a better version of that new bright eyes cd but ryan has a better voice and his music is better. This cd is a must for any fans of bands like Wilco and other alt-country music.
B00846TTDG|5|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! HAVE WATCHED IT NUMEROUS TIMES. EVERYONE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS MOVIE AND TAKE TIME TO REFLECT, LEARN, AND LIVE OUT.
B00BPDR3F6|4|very interesting novel - kept my interest all the way through.
B00N35P5MW|4|I've only played a few levels, but like it so far. I can't complain about a free app!
B0063IH60K|5|Having lots of fun with this classic game.Love the options and a new game resets quickly after a loss. Find myself saying just one more game.
B0010T0QOK|5|While traditional Japanese temple staff wear zori or geta with white straps, at our New York temple, we wear white Crocs.  They fit well, they work well, and they are the right color.  Thank you.
0375707972|1|I was very disappointed in this book.  It was an insipid story told with very little style or emotion.  The author's attempts to enlighten are pathetically juvenile.  This may be the last time I follow one of Oprah's recommendations.  A true waste of my time.
B000T433CO|4|One of the better romantic comedies:  good actors, nice scenery, funny.  It's a bit predictable but there are some surprises.
6305513406|5|As everyone knows this is the second pilot filmed in hopes of launching the Star Trek series and there are a number of differences between this particular show and the others that followed. Most notable immediately is the slightly varied opening and closing theme music; there is no voice-over narration by Shatner in the opening credits either. Other visible differences include the uniforms, the look of the recreation room and the conference room, the odd appearing intercom Kirk speaks into, Sulu is assigned to Life Sciences, the doctor is played by someone else, etc. It still is a very strong episode with a great story encapsulated in a taut script and cast well with the surprising guest stars Gary Lockwood (pre '2001: A Space Odyssey' fame) and Sally Kellerman (pre 'M.A.S.H.' fame) turning in excellent performances.<br />The Enterprise beams aboard a flight recorder from the missing and 200 year old ship U.S.S. Valiant, all that is left of the ship as near as can be determined. The tapes of the flight recorder reveal a very strange and disturbing story concerning the ship's encounter with an unusual force at the edge of the galaxy and also an obsessive interest in the subject of E.S.P. The tapes are too damaged to determine all the facts surrounding the log's narrative; Kirk decides to venture beyond the same demarcation line and that brings about devastating results for two crewmembers. Kirk is forced to take the dire matters into his hands and is left with only one diabolic but very necessary choice if he and the crew of the Enterprise, indeed the whole galaxy, are to survive.<br />After viewing the original pilot 'The Cage' it was described as \\"too cerebral\\" by the NBC studio heads that allowed the Trek creators to produce a second pilot. Though this show is also somewhat cerebral by nature, in 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' Kirk does get into a climactic fistfight, gets his shirt torn to expose his chest and proves himself a crack shot with a rifle. \\"ALLRIGHT!Now that's more like it! Give us more like this!\\" was the enthusiatic reaction of the studio heads to this second go-round (or least my exaggerated interpretation of their response). I don't want to downplay the serious undertones of the episode though; there is real tragedy here. The loss of Kirk's friend and ship's navigator Gary Mitchell and the medical department's newcomer Elizabeth Dehner is a devastating blow to the young captain. Lockwood's portrayal of Mitchell as a newly crowned deity like being is absolutely dead-on perfect. His taunting of Kirk is both creepy and agitating; when he speaks of his powers he sounds only egotistical and not enlightened. Kirk memorably summarizes his friend's quandary quite succinctly and eloquently in the exciting climax.<br />'The Corbomite Maneuver' is an equally good episode, creating some genuine suspense and a clever, fast thinking and nefarious looking alien in Balok. The ship he commands is also very intriguing; after it approaches the Enterprise it balloons to an incredible and intimidating size that the ship's sensors can't measure effectively. The creative staff had even better surprises waiting for the viewer at the end of the episode when Balok is finally unveiled.<br />During a star charting mission the Enterprise encounters a brilliantly colored cube rotating in space, impenetrable to the ship's sensors. At first it appears benign, completely harmless; later, when they try to move around it, it blocks their path and out of necessity they destroy the cube. Shortly afterwards an alien ship appears condemning the ship and it's crew to imminent destruction. With only a reprieve of ten minutes Kirk must either find a way to successfully negotiate their release or invent a clever means of escape.<br />The idea of the stray cube in space is a great concept, and would automatically cause the ship's scientists to assume an intelligent designer must be responsible for its being there. It recalls the Arthur C. Clarke short story 'The Sentinel' that gave rise to the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey', but in storytelling structure the episode resembles a quality more commonly found in the works of Ray Bradbury. This was the first appearance of DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy and his characteristic sense of humanity and his natural diligence to it comes into play right away. He defends the uptight and nervous navigator Lt. Bailey, marvelously characterized by Anthony Hall. Ted Cassidy provides the voice for Balok throughout much of the episode and it is most effective; he was also well cast as the android Ruk in the episode 'What Are Little Girls Made Of?' The final revelation in the show's finale is one of the most extraordinary in the entire ongoing Trek television series.<br />Some final notes: The juxtaposition of these two shows merits a brief discussion. This was the first episode filmed after the second successful pilot but the tenth show to televise in the series. It was said that the show was \\"too cerebral\\" so the character of Captain Kirk was 'dumbed down' a bit and shown to be a man of action in the second pilot. Suddenly in the next episode Kirk ignores any options to fight their enemy - and even chastises crewmembers that do! He wants to think his way out of this one. Naturally if he chooses to fight he stands little to no chance of winning, but the writers chose to place Kirk and his crew in this predicament so he would react this way. Apparently the studio heads were of little concern already. On the lighter side...early in the show Kirk casually strolls through the Enterprise corridors on his way to his quarters bare-chested and sweaty with his shirt hanging around his neck much like a preppie would carry his/her sweater. Is this really acceptable behavior from a superior officer?
B00EHMFC78|5|Baldacci has written another great novel.  Will Robie is a great hero.  The quiet loner with a heart of gold.  You will not be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved it. I laughed and cried. I would like to read a second part, something. 5 stars to this book!
B00BSBUZT6|5|one of the best docs i seen

B00D7Z4GQY|4|Interesting characters make for a fun read.  The novel builds to a well developed and unexpected climax.  The epilogue puts a final twist to the story.
B00CX7TOOG|5|great for the price.
B00DQZT5ZM|5|Great Product!
B000QRIGLC|5|Great book. Touching. Makes you realize how our media affects the military...not in a good way. A must read for military buffs.
B000003S2O|5|Having already described Tangerine Dream's \\"Zeit\\" album as 'the great-granddaddy of all dark ambient albums,\\" I'll simply describe this one as the album without which other releases in the genre would have been impossible - and impossible to supersede as well! Eno's manifold talents as a musician, artist and producer all come to the fore in one ineffable piece of work here.    As others have described, this is a baffling accomplishment in many ways. It is both very obviously \\"studio-based\\" music and simultaneously his most organic effort. It falls into the cracks so successfully in so many realms that it attains what is probably the best argument for his reputation as a \\"purposeful genius\\" that I can imagine.    Emotional, cold - reflective and yet very much in the present, it's a timeless piece of work. There is little doubt in my mind that people will be listening to this two centuries hence with the same feelings of obscure nostalgia and appreciation for the day at hand as we do right now.
0307277887|4|My fiance and I read this book because we are fans of the Dexter series on Showtime. We have become less and less impressed with the show as it has gone on and wanted to read the book that started it all to renew our love for the series.<br /><br />The first season of the show follows the book fairly closely. There are definitely some surprises with the ending of the book. All in all I enjoyed the book, but preferred the Season 1 version of the story. Probably because I saw it before I read the book.<br /><br />I will likely be moving on to the next book in the series and I look forward to seeing how the book and TV series continue to diverge.<br /><br />If you are a fan, this is worth the read!
B00843TZJM|2|This is all speculation of course since the DVD hasn't come out yet, but if it's anything like what I have seen live of late from these guys, don't bother with it. I was a huge fan for many years. Probably longer than I care to remember, but it's time for them to give it up.<br />Most notably Steven Stills. His voice is shot. There is no way around trying to hide it. It's just gone. And Davids' isn't too far behind. They certainly aren't the only ones that should give it up. Paul McCartney comes to mind, but this is about CSN.<br />Please let me remember the way you once were, so very long ago...
B00GT4V5DM|5|Malwarebytes has always been a very reliable program which I have used for years.  I just got a new tablet and MB was one of the first programs I downloaded.

B005PK56TA|5|Glad im not watching this in order ... It makes season one really good
B006HL9G10|5|I got it as free app of the day, and I wish I had paid for it. That's how great this app is.
B007GCY8FS|5|Another story that shocks and thrills. Jack Reacher is the epitome of the perfect character. He has vulnerabilities but he is genuinely smart. He can be easily misread. He is however capable of very good deductive reasoning. This makes him the guy you want on your side in times of trouble.
B00GLX0Z8C|2|Story line too predictable. Too ridiculous. Had some good laughs. Most of the funny scenes were in the previews.
B003DGZCLK|5|One of the original apocolypse movies, it rivals the latest ones, and was filmed before CGI.  The director got it right, the action scenes are good, and more realistic than today's super explosions.
B001G8XON0|5|I love this movie and the blu- ray made it better. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes musicals.
B001BANK32|5|then The Shining is the book for you...I read it when 1st released and could not read it after dark or when alone.  Ive only read it once...it scared me silly the 1st time and that was enough for me.  ShiOne912
B001FB5634|5|We've come to expect 'End of the World' movies as being one giant action picture, but The Road is so far removed from that, and scary in how realistic it very well may be.  If you want action, then check out those other movies.  If you want realism and and an incredible performance by an actor however, just watch Viggo Mortensen in this one.  Fans of Mortensen could never be disappointed in the completeness that he gave to this role, both physically and emotionally.  Intense and brilliant in a hopeless world.
0694515159|3|This book is a neet story, but I agree it is a little hard to swallow as an actual event.  I was confused by the beginning where she prints a disclaimer, but I think this was done in order to give her more leeway in the relaying of the story.  I don't know how she could make this all up, but I am still foggy on the details that she does provide as not fitting together very well.  If you just read it as a story, there is much to learn from the message and it is beautifully written.  I think we'd all like to believe there are still people like the Real People on earth somewhere.
B00AREIAI8|5|love the way the graphics are! my horse coco is adorable! thought i was gunna hate the game but it surprised me! great for being free too!!
B002PEP4U0|5|This was a very inspiring book an  i enjoyed it very much. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys reading about an underdog
B00CO4GO7I|5|Much love to God, Chris, his home family, his SEAL family, and all US service members. Chris was a fine American and he will forever be remembered.
B00GIXWXEO|3|Ryan Reynolds, I miss you as Hal Jordan.  You nailed Green Lantern big spot on, but as a snail?  I don't know.  Turbo himself was way awesome, and some references were great, and it wasn't lost on me that the main opponent was a Frenchman (they eat snails).  But there was just way too much slang talking for me to be a great movie.  Even my kids wouldn't watch it intently the second time we played it.
0439882826|2|This purchase was not at all what I had expected!  A great deal of thought was placed on the pop-ups, which were very intricate.  I'm not sure what the target age for this book would be.  The young child may have difficulty caring for the book in the way that it should be and I don't think it catches the attention of someone older.  Of course, this is only my opinion.
B0086700CM|5|OMG this game is so fun!!!  My teacher got this game on ower ipods.  So now I have it on my kindle fire :{D
B00DR0PDNE|5|Worked well. I am excited about this player.
B0066WJLU6|4|Easy to use, comes on quickly, has an excellent dual light feature for those who want less or different color light.
1573226521|4|Unlike a previous reviewer, I am over 30 (I'm 30 with 10 years experience) and I can heartily recommend this book. It's entertaining in a conventional &quot;thriller&quot; sense, but had impressive echoes and subtexts as well.  It was the first post-modern take on Vietnam I've seen -- Vietnam as  experienced solely through movies and TV shows -- and it gave my brain a  pleasant rattling. I also liked the portrait of the &quot;traveler&quot;  culture.<br />I, too, am looking forward to the movie, and wondering if Leo  will be playing the main character as British or American.
B006MW3UZW|5|Now I know why everyone was so addicted to it. Thanks Amazon Prime
B00B1LN8WY|5|Bought this as a wedding present for my bride, she loved it!  Consolidates all of the season DVDs in one box at a price cheaper than buying them individually
B000M5B6Q0|5|This movie was so much fun.  And the music is so catchy, I find myself singing along.  I bought this CD the day after I saw the movie.  Hugh Grant is amazing.  Who knew he could sing and dance?  Anyways, I'm not ashamed to admit that I love these cheesy songs. It's okay to have a good time when you listen to music.
B00H0FGHDM|4|This was a beautifully written story, I read it in two sittings. Colleens stories are always brilliant. A must read
B002MW50KO|5|A collage of Mr D voice and the sweet arrangements just work well. He hits again the right spot. My 8 yo son loves that, can not be that wrong then? I do not understand what others may expect from Mr D? 5 stars again, for courage and delivery.
B004QBWU02|5|One of my favorites.
B008Y212PI|5|This game is great. I like to keep my mind busy especially when I relax and this game definitly does that!
B00475AYJQ|1|Like many other reviewers, I just cannot understand why this book is so popular. Kvothe is one of the least likable characters I have ever encountered in anything I've ever read. A guy who's the best at everything and is beloved by all, except for a handful of utterly cliched antagonists. Then there's the pacing. Nothing happens! Or rather, a few things happen: Kvothe is low on cash, Kvothe pines for Denna, Kvothe plays his lute. These things happen over and over and over and over again throughout the course of 700 pages per book. The writing style is easy to follow, and the cover art is nice, but these are the only two things this book has going for it.
B00DRPVE3M|5|It is very challenging game I love it<br /><br />It is the best game in Wisconsin other people should get it  wow
B00CKKDZ2S|5|This app is great...i feel like i am getting the info when i need to hear it! I really  enjoy it!
B005FLX2WC|5|I hadn't paid much attention to this CD, as I had never heard of Beth. Well, I'm glad I heard her now! This is a powerfully arranged soul-blues album where both Beth and Joe shine. Beth has just an intense, gorgeous voice. It's almost mesmerizing. To keep my words short, take a look at a video from their duet in NYC on 11/5/11: [...]    I bought the CD the next day after seeing this show.
B00BKTFABE|4|Good quality video but uses a lot of memory so beware of reduced functionality in other areas.
B005IQZB14|5|Cheryl's story is funny and pure. Her story has inspired me to live every moment with joy.  Even to look back on the worst moments as detours....forks in the road..
B003WTE886|5|good job
B00B0X4PIO|4|Like most people, I became a Khaled Hosseini fan after reading The Kite Runner. So I was excited to read his new book after many years.<br /><br />It treads familiar Hosseini ground - the nostalgia for the rugged but honorable old Afghanistan, separation of families and friends across continents, guilt, hardship and tragedy. This book is more epic in scope than The Kite Runner, and leaves you with a big lump in your throat at the end...<br /><br />The sprawling book begins with a haunting fable about a div (giant monster or ogre in Persian) who takes away a little child from his family. A div, or demon, draws a father into a terrible pact. The father can gift his favourite son a better life by giving the child away, never to see him again.<br /><br />We soon find out that it is actually a microcosm of the rest of the book. This is what Saboor, the poor Afghan father telling the story, is himself about to do to his three-year-old daughter, Pari, who has an unusually powerful bond to her brother, Abdullah. Pari is adopted by Nila Wahadati, a rich, rebellious childless poetess. Pari's step-uncle Nabi works for Nila's husband Suleiman Wahadati. Though the child is distraught by the thought of being away from her brother Abdullah, she slowly forgets her past after she is introduced to a life of affluence and independence. A life that would have been unimaginable had she grown up in her native village of Shadbagh. Still, Pari feels a sense of being incomplete and she cannot figure out why.<br /><br />The rest of the book is comprised of nine short stories, each telling the life of one of the interconnected characters in the book. Some of them a little gems with unexpected stings in the tail. A couple are slow and drag along while we wait to find out if Pari & Abdullah will eventually meet. Through the process, we encounter the conflicted inner worlds of character in classic Hosseini style, and revisit our own half-finished lives in the process.<br /><br />Overall, not as punchy as The Kite Runner but still a beautiful book. A touch more contrived emotionally. But still a good epic with an interesting narrative device, told by a writer who has great insight and greater compassion for the human heart. We see ourselves in the pages and in the longings of the characters.punchy as The Kite Runner but still a beautiful book. A touch more contrived emotionally.

B00F8MIIKO|4|C'mon! It's the Monsters prequel. How could you not watch it. Mike and Sully are always fun to watch and the introduction of new characters as well as how some of the characters from Monsters Inc were worked in was entirely entertaining.
B00SXK8R6S|5|Wonderfully written.  This is one of my favorites so far, and I think I like it better than &#34;Games of the Thrones&#34;, honestly.  When the second season becomes available, I will one of the first to watch it.
B000N2HCKQ|5|This book is a great read whether or not you do marketing. It shows us how we react to the stimuli around us and how we can be more persuasive in influencing others.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Absolutely beautiful!!!! I love his music!!!
B009AYVNEY|5|Really interesting movie showing the relationship progression between Mother and son over the years. That child was unhappy from birth. Scarey stuff.
B00KT3MWWM|5|great song, Youtube it before you buy
0147515025|5|loved the books
B000S586H6|4|If it was possible to rate an album 4.5 I would do so.  This isn't a perfect metal album, but it's a darn good rocking one.
B001DPHDCY|5|Jim Carrey does a great job as Horton in this movie. It is one of my favorites in the Dr. Seuss series!
B001ANSS5K|5|Good
B0007GAEW6|4|I borrowed this album from a friend a while ago, and listened to it the whole way through. It is a great CD, these guys have got talent. The only real complaint I have is the HUUUGGEEE amout of filler. Otherwise, great material, highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|4|Excellent except it still needs  better list handling and more tablet/phone capability for this User, padding the word count of this review to meet the required minimum
B007J4T2G8|4|Interesting take on a taboo subject. It was a hard read at first, but became impossible to put down and wanted to read the rest of the series.
B006LSZECO|5|Awesome well-written book filled with tons of suspense and twists. Didn't want to put it down! You won't be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5|Everything about this book makes me want my own Christian grey!! I can't wait to read more books by EL James
B00BHHIWQO|5|Awesome game
B005NJ2K6U|4|I don not have the original so I can not compare but this game is nice and better than jewel
B0094BB4TW|4|keeps me in touch with my family and friends and what is going on, Like all the pictures and jokes
B00FAPF5U0|4|addictive and fun to play. always need my candy crush fix. I like the new night owl game too. it adds something different
B00HAQAQME|1|Weird movie!! The story line was not very interesting.  Didn't even finish watching it. The acting was not very good either.
B000002GVZ|5|Had this years ago. Lost it somewhere long ago.Now I have it once again. Very happy. She's one of the finest singers ever.
B009K6DKTS|5|Nassim Taleb is clearly an exceptionally intelligent analyst of risk. This book complements his earlier work &#34;Black Swan&#34;. The thoughts and ideas put forward in this book were new and valuable. I would recommend it to serious readers who think about the world around them and want to understand it better, particularly the risks we face day-to-day and those we do not expect. It gave me insights that will be of value to me in the future.
B00006690G|5|From top to bottom, Eminem pretty much outdoes himself on this album, lyrically and production wise. Him and Dre put some of their greatest effort into this album, and it showed. The only suspect tracks on here are \\"My Dad's Goin' Crazy\\", and \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\", cause one's too goofy to listen to on a regular basis, and the other is just nothin' special. But everything else is pretty much classic material, including the slow tempo \\"Drips\\" w/ Obie Trice, \\"Til I Collapse\\" w/ Nate Dogg, \\"White America\\", \\"Square Dance\\", the Sting(I think)-sampled \\"Sing for The Moment\\", the face-paced \\"Superman\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\" w/ D-12, \\"Business\\", and \\"Say What You Say\\", w/ Eminem and Dr. Dre annihilate Jermaine Dupri. Now that's ten songs I just named, who else in recent memory has had THAT many top notch on an album, where the filler material beats out other people's BEST work. If you slept on this album, it's just cause you hated on Em, and you just couldn't get the Ja Rule and Bow Wow outta your headphones.
B00CWY76CC|5|Fun game to play and very addicting. Need more levels and maybe a hint button because sometimes it is hard to figure things out.
B00AZRBLHO|5|Definitely reads like a novel, and has some serious IT life lessons. In my mind all I had to do was change a few names and it felt like they were talking about my company.
0345531965|5|From the beginning, this book keeps you excited, wondering whats going to happen next and you cant wait to hear what happens in the end.<br />i loved everything about the book. I have recommended it to everyone!
B000SZK41M|5|Are you serious? Die hard is the most amazing action movie I've ever seen in my life. If you like explosions, shooting, manly as **** one liners, you must see this movie now!
B00BUVPIRS|1|Waste of time
B0050DIWFC|3|I wish some of the characters were likeable.  On the plus side, it did hold my attention.  I found the main character to be a jerk.  The parents were pathological, and ultimately nothing was resolved.  \\"Jacob\\" was never helped..., ugh.  Wouldn't reread or recommend.  But I was able to push through to the finish.
B008XG1X18|4|I love this app and everything about it. From pinning workout routines to finding new and delicious meals, this app is definitely good for killing time or relaxing with a cup of coffee in the morning. The only thing that is currently bothering me is that it will not let me update it... otherwise, a must download.
B006MPKD54|4|A great follow-up book. The main character is believable. A great storyline. This book kept Me turning page after page. The ending that I didn't see coming.
B00E5Q1HJS|3|Actually, that would describe most of the Trek movies, and a lot of the TV besides.  Acting didn't make it, with the exception of Lt Uhuru, who came across quite well, and wonderful eye-candy besides.  Spock was particularly unsuccessful, as was Scotty.  Both were almost facial, specially Scotty.  Bones came across fairly well, as did Kahn.  A reasonable start into exploring the human consequences of genetic enhancement.<br /><br />Recommended for Trekkies everywhere, so long as they have the ability to suspend disbelief, or at least critical analysis, and can lean back and enjoy some largely non-demanding viewing.
B005RJ6AIK|5|This CD relaxes me after a crazy day on the planet.It reminds me of my trip to Kauai this year.
B00MXILU3S|5|This is history, babe. This is a complete recording that in same way change change the music. Is the complete adventure of a man that try to find his way. He was a super star that try to find his roots. Probably is so much to many people but not for Dylan's fans. Is a great adventure. I know thats include some not very good  versions, but thats is all the Complete Basements Tapes, all tapes. If you are a Dylan fans you need it. Also you can understand how then work  each song. Is a great experience. Thanks Dylan and CBS to do it. Probably is the mod personal recording of Dylan.<br /><br />PS. This edition have a very nice presentation. Not only the very nice book with photos, also the cover of the 6 CD, in another book splendid edited. A excellent design.
0689835604|5|My son loves this book, all the books by Karen Katz he loves and this was no exception; it is a great book over all.
B001E45XT4|5|I have had this headset for about a week now and I have to say that I really like it.  I've purchased other headsets in the past and they do not fit my head or break shortly after using.  This headset is durable and fits comfortably around my huge noggin.  It's worth the price.
B0019FOC5E|5|Were I live we do not have the Mamma Mia Soundtrack in our stores. My niece got the movie for Christmas and I'm going to give her the soundtrack for her birthday. We all love the movie and the sounftrack as I have both of my own.
B0060AY6FO|5|This is the first sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I have enjoyed! P.D. James has the talent and love of Austen that are prerequisite to writing about Elizabeth and Darcy. The book is captivating and the mystery and its twists kept me guessing. She even includes several characters from other Austen novels. Delightful! I recommend it to all fans of Jane Austen's novels!
B00499S9YC|5|great music, high quality press, beautiful cover.
B00JVZ0DQG|1|Didn't understand how to play..and I play a bunch of games.  Very confusing to me and I am not looking to be confused as I want fun and enjoy ment.
B001NAT05W|5|a+ a good movie & one the is good for the collection! one that will not disappoint at all. if you likle super hero movies, this is a good one for you!
0062238868|5|Chris' descriptions of every day life during BUD-S and further training are reminders from days long gone.  Despite the Press hype, Chris doesn't break any secrets, but gives glimpses into everyday SEAL life, and allows his wife's take on things as well.  RIP Chris, you were slain by a fellow Vet, but you were doing what you loved at the time- helping fellow Vets.
0307719774|5|A really interesting, fun idea, and something I think my kids and grandkids would enjoy looking through. All questions are interesting, and I love the book's setup. Most of the questions are easy to make up, too, in case you miss a day or two. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!
B00E8KLWB4|4|These games are incredibly addictive and easy to understand they guide you through the game and give you helpful tips along the way. I recommend this game if you like any of the puzzle games out there because this is going to be one of the more enjoyable ones.
B004DLPXAO|5|easy to install, great search engine.
6305291446|5|If you're not into the Halloween series - then this isn't for you. But if you are and if Halloween (the original) is one of your all time Fav Halloween movies -then add this one to your collection.
1426308469|5|These kids first Nat Geo books are a great value. We have several different ones and they are nicely done and the quality is fantastic.
B000003TAR|5|This album is Worth every  single penny.Musically and Lyrically hightly violent and appealing.Just buy it if you like good music and lyrics.
B00IG2DOKM|5|This game is a winner . It's super fun and if you want to buy more coins or dollars you have to pay other then that this game is free and a 55 stars ...... if they had 55 stars.<br /><br />Allycia .c. garcia
B00M7URUUE|4|Very religious person, but had no expectations of this following the bible, and was not disappointed. Overall entertaining and well acted.
B0097HSS4M|5|I loved this app. I enjoyed renewing my old photos, this app made it super easy and fun. It is worth the price.
B00B00RJJO|5|I hadn't bought a Billy Bragg record in twenty years but I ordered this one after listening to the preview samples and I was glad I did.
B00J5LXTUI|5|Amazing!!!
B00OH75ATS|5|in my opinion I loved it. great plot and all the memorable characters made it amazing.
B004UPANAI|4|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was nice to see the beginning of the beginning of X-Men.  Adventure and suspenseful.
B00FAX6XQC|4|I like the premise of the game but keep having to wait to regain strength to continue but it is still fun to play!
0345803493|5|The second book in the 50 shades trilogy was my absolute FAVORITE.  It combined enough of the crazy, wild writing that was found in Book 1 with enough of the happily ever after moments that make you fall in love with Christian Grey!
B00IS87HYI|3|Average  did not<br /> Get how to play the game.
B007EE4XKI|5|This was a fascinating story about Dr. Soong the father. His androids are his children as he see it. The story is awesome with many twist and answers to questions from the series. Thoroughly enjoyable. I will not say more and spoil the experience of reading it for yourself.
B004LK5CEE|5|I always thought the lead charatcter (Russell) was a shallow ^@$%, but after seeing the deleted scenes I get what they were actually striving for.  It's a shame those scenes had to be removed to fit into the narrow attention span gap of pop culture.  Easy Oscar contender with those scenes, understandably not without.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|I like this game a lot but the constant push to buy bubbles gets old.  I would be willing to pay a small amount now that I enjoy the game.  As long as I don't have to deal with the 'buy' stuff constantly.
B0050DIWFC|2|The book was recommended for Ken Follet fans and I decided to purchase it while waiting for Ken Follet's Book Three of the Century Trilogy to be available. I was so disappointed. The characters are uninspiring and flat. The language is so mundane and boring I skimmed through the first few chapters hoping for something that actually made me stop and pay attention but it never happened. he violent gene or whatever they call it is not enough to make the book worth reading. It is definitely no where near  Follet's master use of language, character, plot and location.
B000002H33|5|You've most likely seen all of the good reviews for this album.  To tell you the truth, this is probably one of the greatest albums ever created in all of Metal.  I would just like to comment on a few of the previous \\"bad\\" reviews of the CD. <br /> <br />1.  THERE IS ANOTHER MEANING TO THE WORD BATTERY.  Battery doesn't have to mean \\"energizer battery\\", it can also mean repeated strikes and attack.  Funny how the energizer battery comment was on a review that said, \\"i'm a genius\\" <br /> <br />2.  THE GUITAR PLAYING IS NOT BAD.  Plenty of people commented and mentioned that \\"the guitars sound like chainsaws\\"  FYI, to do that with a guitar take more skill than you think.  If you have ever tried an instrument (like guitar), you'll actually respect that. <br /> <br />3.  ST. ANGER IS NOT METALLICA!! <br /> <br />That's my opinion.  Follow some of the better reviews of the album.  They'll point you in the right direction.  :-)
B00005JL9B|5|This is, hands down, the BEST MOVIE COMING OUT OF JAPAN IN YEARS. As a reviewer who read the book first and loved it, I had high expectations for this movie and it did not let me down. Here's a quick plot summary: the Japanese government is in chaos. The adults are afraid the youth, who are apparently uncontrollable and boycott school. Therefore, the government institutes `Battle Royale', a program designed to rein in the youth. A ninth-grade class is randomly selected each year, sent to a deserted island, supplied with weapons, and forced to kill each other until there is one survivor. I would have thought it difficult for a movie to track all 42 kids. In the book, this is fine since the book is 600+ pages. But this also works very well in the movie since the director somehow gives almost all the characters substantial screen time and v. memorable scenes. He doesn't cut any character short. And even the short scenes have real poignancy. Therefore, we remember almost all the characters, what they did, and how they died. <br />THE ACTING IS SUPERB. The kids in this movie are played by actors between 15-20 years old. With the exception of one or two, the actors were v. believable and conveyed all the teenage angst, suspicion, hatred, rage, love, goodness, and all the other goodies in the book. And even when they are doing terrible things to each other, they are still sympathetic characters since we understand they are deathly scared and are still young....that unique balance is crucial to the movie's success.  Just to mention a few standouts: ERI ISHIKAWA (Yukie Utsumi) is the best actress, best-looking girl, and my favorite in this entire movie. She's perfect as the class representative who tries to calm everyone down but ends up feeling the same suspicion that is doing her classmates in. Her lighthouse scene is the most memorable scene in the film, and in my opinion, one of the best scenes in the history of cinema; just watch her face...aahhhh, that is perfect acting... TAKESHI \\"BEAT\\" KITANO (Kitano) is the perfect combination of menace and sympathy as the teacher who sends the kids to their deaths and reads out the names of the dead with phrases like, `Here is your list of goners! Only 3 dead. You're slacking off, I'm disappointed with you!' I love how emotions can flicker on and off his face; at one point, he can be scary and mean and terrible as hell; at other times, we feel sorry for him! TATSUYA FUJIWARA (Shuya Nanahara) and AKI MAEDA (Noriko Nakagawa) are fantastic as the couple we root for. Aki Maeda, especially, looks adorable in the movie and conveys innocence and purity so well. TARO YAMAMOTO (Shogo Kawada) is one of my fave characters in this movie and is the best bad-ass I've seen in movies for a while. He looks simultaneously tough and soft, which gives him an interesting complex. MASANOBU ANDO (Kazuo Kiriyama) and KOU SHIBASAKI (Mitsuko Souma) are deliciously wicked as the class's two crazy/wild ones, the two that are consciously going out to kill their classmates without remorse. And, on a vain note, SOUSUKE TAKAOKA, who plays the sweet and caring Hiroki Sugimura, is a major hottie. <br />The DIALOGUE in this movie, like the book, is sometimes cringe-worthy (you know, like, `Damn! I survived, thanks to my excellent bulletproof vest!!'). However, because it is usually delivered perfectly and on target, I hardly noticed it. (It may also be because the actors were speaking Japanese and I was only reading subtitles because I can't understand Japanese.) Although I did like the book better than the movie (tells you how good the book was since I think the movie is FANTASTIC), there are some moments in the movie that outshine even the book because of the acting and the way the dialogue is delivered. For example, Yukie's LIGHTHOUSE SCENE is much better in the movie than it is in the book. I love the way their voices become delirious and the way their anger escalates (it's nearly palpable!). <br />Also, the setting is well-done, too. There are a lot of neutral and cool colors like whites, grays, and cool blues that set the mood and provide a contrast for all the bright red blood. That reminds me: this movie has, like the book, been criticized as VIOLENT EXPLOITATION. That is understandable since the movie shows young classmates killing each other in messy, realistic ways, some willfully and some out of fear. The movie is v. bloody and v. violent and sometimes gratuitous. I normally don't like violence, I don't like blood and guts and gore flying everywhere. I really hate those `Halloween' and `Freddy' and `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type movies because blood spills needlessly and in an excessive/stupid way. But `Battle Royale' is different. The violence will sometimes make your stomach turn, but you'll think, that's the only way it could have been done. <br />And lastly, I have to praise the way CLASSICAL MUSIC is used in this movie. It's done in a v. artsy way that makes you think about the horrible things you've seen and make sense out of it, and I loved it. The use of Mozart and Giuseppe Verdi's `DIES IRAE (REQUIEM MASS)' in the opening sequence is especially incredible. It practically lets you know that you're in for a wild, thought-provoking, horrific, unique, and exciting ride. Also, MASAMICHI AMANO (the composer) did a great job on the original music in `Battle Royale.' I've listened to most of the soundtrack and think every one I've listened to has real poignancy and feeling. The way it is used in the film is even better; it brings even more meaning to what the kids are feeling and what they are doing. <br />This is an INCREDIBLE movie - a mind-blowing exposition of the minds of teenagers and a fantastic exercise of style. I LOVED this movie. After watching it, you will be thinking about it for days; all the scenes of teenage angst will not leave your mind too easily. I give it my highest recommendation...go watch it right now!!
B008602KQI|3|too slow and violent in the first half -- second half makes more sense and a  very good ending saves the film
B0095ZMMCK|5|excellent story. BEST book so far this year. higly suggest this read to anyone interested in how our military should operate. i really enjoyed the read and was sorry when it was over.
B001UV4XHY|3|This movie reminded me of March of the Penguins.  We watch the trio of kids traipse all around England like the penguins marched around Antarctica in MotP, and the pacing of the movies was eerily similar.  Just as an occasional polar bear-ish siting would happen to liven things up in MotP, there is an occasional villain popping up in this movie to liven things up.  Both movies also lack a driving narrative.  In MotP, the penguins just go back and forth because that's what they do.  Here, the trio look for horacruxes because...well, because...well, because they have to!<br /><br />It was nice to look at, the acting is fine, and I am eager for Part 7.  I'm hoping Part 7 delivers all of the excitement that this movie was missing.
B002QE3CTY|4|Post-dystopian(?) book with convincing world building. At several parts of the book, I felt stress for the characters in the book, that they get through whatever crisis they were in. That's a good sign. Mr. Dasher clearly knows how to develop empathy in readers for his characters. Looking forward to seeing the movie and reading the next book.
068484267X|4|I personally just love books! My teacher recommended this for me to read ( well really the whole class and I was the one who bought it) and it was a slow read but funny and interesting.
B005PK57IK|5|Love it
B00DURGZHW|2|only watched it because Matthew McConaughey was in it :( didn't care for the movie. Please add more updated movies for prime customers.
1441761241|5|A National Blue Ribbon Book, The Kitchen House is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of Kathleen Grissom's antebellum novel of tragedy, family bonds, love, loyalty, prejudice, and ruin. Orphaned as a seven-year-old Irish immigrant, Lavinia grows up living and working with the slaves of a kitchen house on a tobacco plantation. Cared for by Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter, Lavinia shares a strong tie with her adoptive family even though the color of her skin sets her apart. When Lavinia is allowed into the \\"big house\\", she finds herself on the border between severely different and utterly unequal worlds. Lavinia must make drastic choices with cruel consequences, in this captivating and suspenseful chronicle. Highly recommended. 10 CDs, 13 hours, tracks every three minutes for easy bookmarking.

B00D660M6M|5|I heard a random clip of the song \\"Another Love\\", by chance, on a Public Radio segment in December 2013. It took me several days to discover the name of the artist and the name of the song. But I instantly recognized the immense talent of the singer. The song kept running through my head, I HAD to find the singer, the track. When I located it on Amazon, I bought the CD immediately and it has not left my player since. Although he writes and plays with his own wonderfully unique brand, Mr Odell also manages somehow to remind me of the Damien Rice love songs, if they were performed by David Bowie. The tracks on this CD flow from one song to another in a flawless, waterfall of notes and words. At last, a new singer songwriter who cuts to the heart and sings to the soul with such amazing range and talent. I can't wait to listen to his next offering.
B00005RFAI|1|Pink (more so than Brittney) is the utmost example of the pupetteer business of having a record deal.  Pink has a good voice, but the &quot;no one likes me, no one understands me&quot; act is irritating and tiring.  She tries so hard to be different, that it comes off as a pure ACT. Wasn't she R&amp;B before?  Don't tell me she's another Mariah coming out of her &quot;True&quot; shell.<BR>She name-drops too much, but I give her credit for effort in writing lyrics that TRY to be controversial.  If one is indeed so original and controversial, she wouldn't have to try so hard, and it would show!
0061660167|3|I found this to be sweetly intriguing. I loved the journey and the characters! And the creepy rodent songs were... well, creepy.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Very much enjoyed this movie.  I had heard some negative reviews but my wife and I thought it was outstanding and certainly gave us a nice evening of entertainment.
B00PXZT1RA|2|I paid for the game because I was enjoying it. Then a little over half way through the game the hint button quit working then the game quit. I could hear the game but screen was black would not do nothing. I know it's not my kindle because my other games work fine! I want my money back! GRRRR

B003G4W49C|5|This book holds the story of a great war, all determined by a great child. This child, named Andrew Wiggin, or Ender, is influenced throughout his childhood to fight in the war with the enemy, called buggers, and learns many things that lead him to be who he is. This fictional story entails exciting events that should be remembered by all who read it.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great book!  Watch carefully at the beginning of each chapter for names and dates!
0800141660|5|A faithful, well-directed and superbly cast production.  A nice intro to the Austen genre for newbies, and a satifying interpretation for the dedicated Austen fans.  Watch this film and read the book (not necessarily in that order).
0312330855|5|All Creatures Great and Small opens an unforgettable series of personal memoirs by a country veterinarian in 1940's Yorkshire (also known as James Alfred Wight).  These are written in a series of short chapter vignettes, with a warm, wry humor that vividly, affectionately, and sometimes mercilessly captures human nature in the context of this cultural scene.  Many descriptions are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will be spontaneously read aloud to the nearest listener.  But Herriot is no cynic -- his writing pokes fun at himself at least as often as others, and his self-deprecating wit provides an appeal that is near irresistible.  This first book in the series follows Herriot's starting-out years as a vet, his induction into Siegfried Farnon's local practice, his adjustment to the local ways and customs, and his courtship of the lovely Helen Alderson.<br /><br />A country vet's life involves a lot of bloody and sometimes gross work, which will appeal to some readers and may repel others.  There is an obvious appeal for animal lovers and potential medical students, as he treats both pets and farm animals, and Herriot sets a good moral example through his kindhearted willingness to undergo inconvenience and indignity for the sake of the animals under his care.  Implicit throughout his books is the belief that humans have a responsibility to provide good care to the animals who serve them.<br /><br />In his portrayal of his Yorkshire clients, he attempts to capture the flavor of their speech, and this does include some profanities.  The words \\"bloody,\\" \\"hell,\\" and \\"bugger\\" appear fairly frequently, but there are few American swear words.  Parents ought to use discretion, but I don't think this element should not be too harmful for mature readers.<br /><br />Because some of the humor is rather sophisticated and Herriot's prose is sometimes difficult, I recommend this for ages 16-18, but if enjoyed with a parent it is quite likely to appeal to younger readers, especially those who have enjoyed Herriot's stories for children [[ASIN:0312085125 James Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small]].erriot's stories for children [[ASIN:0312085125 James Herriot's Treasury for Children: Warm and Joyful Tales by the Author of All Creatures Great and Small]].
B009GEBBNQ|5|I watched this using Amazon Video on Demand. I actually joined Amazon Local and got a free coupon for a $2.00 discount on any video I wanted. So, of course, wanting to see this since the trailer came out... I decided to put the credit towards this film. The code was super easy to use!  I'm so glad I rented from here.<br /><br />It was so easy. Much easier than going to Blockbuster or some brick and mortar store. I don't know how store rentals could even compete. The video played instantly and quickly.  My credit was accepted and the video resolution was very good. I had no streaming problems. I also paused the video a couple times to get some drinks or use the restroom.<br /><br />Marvel's The Avengers is a really well written action film. I would expect nothing less of Joss Whedon. He is, of course, famous for making high art action (like Buffy, Firefly, Serenity, etc). Avengers is no exception. All of the super hero characters were like-able and interesting. Each had a back story and depth, as well as enough flaws to keep the film moving.  To top it off, this was like a feel good film without being cheesy.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I will just say this has the moral lesson of Captain America, the muscles of Thor, the beauty of Black Widow, the humor of Iron Man, and a little flourish that is pure Whedon SciFi.  All of the good elements of the previous films seemed to be incorporated here and there were no dull moments.<br /><br />I may end up buying this film.
B00F7YHDWC|1|Grandkids downloaded it on my kindle.  I deleted it.  Who wants little kids to see Dumb Ways to Die.  UGH !  Needless to say I not have parental controls set.
B00AB7HESI|5|It's a fun game. Creative.
B00KW274SM|4|I always enjoy Liam Neeson. Not quite as good as expected, but still a good movie rental. Worth it to me.
B00A2H9P98|5|This is one of the great modern movies.  Story line, acting, etc. are all top notch.  A very good movie we'll enjoy for years.
B000SEIK2S|3|If youre old enough to remember those space operas (otherwise called space westerns) that crowded the pages of the pulp sci-fi magazines in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, you might have been a fan, since you were certainly young enough to enjoy them. I didn뗪. I thought even then that the stories were lame. Most science fiction writers have gone on to bigger and better things in the decades since then, and I for one am delighted.<br /><br />All of which is to say that the inaugural volume in what has become at least a seven-book series  both the book and the series are called Old Man뗩 War  comes across to me as a story that only a fourteen-year-old could truly love. Yes, I뗤 aware how popular this novel and its sequel have become. I can only account for that by imagining that the number of adolescents is even greater than I뗛 thought  or that a large proportion of sci-fi fans haven뗪 progressed beyond the emotional age of fourteen.<br /><br />Here뗩 what뗩 distressing about this book:<br /><br />** The story is entirely predictable.<br /><br />** The future world depicted in its pages bears no resemblance to any scenario that might be projected on the basis of scientific principles  which means, in effect, that Old Man뗩 War doesn뗪 really qualify as science fiction.<br /><br />** The bug-eyed monsters that populated those old pulp stories are resurrected here in all their improbable glory.<br /><br />Why, then, did I actually read this book all the way to the end? (Yes, I do that with every book I review!) Two reasons: (1) John Scalzi writes reasonably well and is particularly adept at dialogue. (2) Scalzi has a wonderfully impish sense of humor. He뗩 a smartass, really, and there뗩 just enough of the fourteen-year-old left in me that I relate to that.<br /><br />If youre wondering what happens in Old Man뗩 War, you뗣l need to read the book. I뗤 not telling.
B001DTPZNY|1|I like toKnow whi I dint get this DVD  ,they said I got it  peter
B000MQC9H4|5|Such a cute, romantic movie.  I am happy for the escape it provides . . . positive message.
B0069G5Z9K|4|I love it! But maybe you should come up with a new game where your the scientists or something like that.
B003P2WO5E|5|This book is the foundation of a huge epic tale. Be prepared to read a massive amount of character development and world building.  However, when one finishes the book, one understands the necessity.
B006LSZECO|4|This is just the kind of book I love to read.  Witty, sarcastic just really well written.  I would definitely recommend this book.  Once I started, I couldn't put it down.
B0082RHRHC|5|Watched the movie with Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester. Loved the movie, the book was a little tiresome to read.
B00HNG7UM0|5|Love little Women
B007FEFLTO|5|I enjoyed this second book of the trilogy by Ken Follett.  It continues the story with some new characters that are descendants of the first book along with the previous characters.  It is quite detailed and follows through the storylines from the U.K., U.S.A., Germany and Russia.
1595825045|5|Read it cover to cover multiple times. It's filled with amazing artwork and very interesting commentary; I think it would make an especially great gift for any avatar fan.
B0046B3QTG|4|Cute movie.
B009FZFONO|5|The Season 3 episodes were great.<br />All story lines were masterfully cohesive.<br />The characters interesting.<br />A must see for all horror fans
B000AGTPUU|4|My Grandkids, ages 8 and 4, really liked this movie.  The animation is fantastic.  The four year old loves anything to do with trains.  Some things seemed a little scary but they both handled it well.  Overall, it is a very good Christmas movie.
B00AN0KBJC|5|great series...well done
0783225776|5|This movie is the epitome of what a college movie should be!  Belushi by far is the show stealer, as Bluto Blutosky, and all the characters make  this &quot;fraternity&quot; rock!  Sure this movie may have inspired some  craziness for us when we went through college, but come on!  If you want  something more modern, try PCU, but no movie about college or fraternities  will ever compare to the funny, crazy, and greatness of what was produced  in National Lampoon's Animal House!
B001FB55MG|5|Love it
B006ATJXQW|5|Very good answered some questions about the series
B00EY8A6BC|5|Awesome movie!! Great job casting, well acted and a roller coaster ride throughout. It'll keep you guessing all the way to the end.
0142000671|4|Very good book, I like the feel of the book cover.
B00BFUUMO8|5|This game is the best! You get to fight, get cool buildings, and unlock<br />the ice age and underwater park.You get coins and bucks for doing<br />missions.  I rated it 5 stars.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Both my boys 11 &13 LOVED this book! Most I have never seen them more excited about any book.
B008UCJ7KO|2|WELL I read Bared to YOU and Reflected to YOU .. waited ..and waited for Entwined with YOU  .. couldnt wait to read it !!  Super excited for the RELEASE date to come ... well .. .I read it the day it came out .. in a day and half done.... Did NOT like the ending.. could of ended alot better... this book has no substance to it .. other than sex .. and fill in the holes of book one and two.. alot could of been left out and just told in seriously 4 chapters at most....  I really felt left down ... I love the characters ... i love Gideon ... but i feel there could of been alot more there!!  Of course if you read book One and Two.. you will read this one.. just because you need closure of the characters ...but you will feel disappointed .. as I was .. and as Most were from the rating of this book and the posts .... Im sure i will read book 4 ..but i wont be as eagerly waiting like I did for book 2 and 3 .... I hope Sylvia turns book 4 around to make up for book 3 !!!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00APUQPX6|3|Found the movie a little boring... I guess it doesn't help that we had just watched Happy Feet the night before and the concepts are so similar. There are some cute parts, but overall, we weren't impressed.
B00FWLDHSY|3|Good movie
B008602KQI|4|I really didn't know anything about the story before watching. If you are into sci-fi you will probably enjoy this film. For myself, I can take it or leave it.
B0007KVAVG|5|This is a great album if your a Judas Priest fan you will like this. Rob Halford sounds great! I Love it!
B00004STUL|4|The chemistry between MARTIN LAWRENCE and WILL SMITH is the strength of this movie. Tea Leoni plays really well (and she looks GOOD) with these guys, too, in this buddy/cop/international drug dealer tale. I thought this was a comedy, but I was wrong. There is humor, yes. BUT, THIS A MAJOR BANG, BANG, SHOOT 'EM UP, BLAST 'EM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH, MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS, CAR CHASE MOVIE. Will Smith exposes his finely toned chest liberally. He looks great.<br />I REALLY ENJOYED the special features commentary by Micheal Bay, the director. It was his first real movie. Bay went on to do the Transformer movies and Armaggedon, so you get the action connection.<br />There's violence and plenty of STRONG LANGUAGE. PROBABLY NOT FOR KIDS. Because BIG ACTION movies are not my favorite genre, I give this movie 3 1/2. But, because I can't give it a 3 1/2, I give it a 4. If you like action movies, you might even give it a 5.
B009WUAK2M|5|The movie is quite Captivating and full of action, with an interesting story line. I will definitely recommend it to my friends to watch...
B004VMUS9G|5|Lots of functionality. User interface is overly complex, not pretty. But it doesn't really bother me. It works great. I like the fact that it can wake up to a song
B00004VWA7|5|\\"Excellent record in its own right without a doubt. Even only living such a shortened lifespan, Jaco Pastorius (after hearing his name and samples of Portrait of Tracy from SWV and Wagon Christ) along with some assistance and experience from Weather Report has created an album not only mesmerising and eclectic but full of emotions that are just simple and complex to detect through the song titles. Full of variety, sonic environments, and a sense of geographic location that can be construed to have setted over in Middle Africa, South of the United States, and up north somewhere in New York or Pennsylvania. While this is not entirely the jazz genre, this is a fusion-based record that incorporates elements of blues, rock-and-roll, and world music into the sound. Immersive at the same time as well which if I repeat only just places much more of what is said from above. For new folks unknown to Pastorius, you will love this album in short if you do like Miles Davis' more experimental works, Squarepusher, and even Paul Hardcastle.\\"<br /><br />BEST SONGS: Okonole Y Trompa (as great and as calculating as mathematics and a great Eno-esque ambient song). Continuum (powerful, mellow, and quite scary in some ways). Portrait of Tracy (the most classic and most relaxing here on the list). Opus Pocus (quirky and offbeat just as how jazz is especially in New Orleans).
B0094BB4TW|4|Don't update. It was fine before the update then once I updated it I can't play a video without it crashing. But if you don't update it the app it works fine. Other than having an update problem it is a super awesome app.
B008SAZHLQ|5|Really good book! Hope the writer writes a sequel to it!
B000I8G5C6|5|Funny and good lesson
014241543X|5|great story
B00I8Q77Y0|4|I like the game its cool and its different but I hare that its sensitive. I don't touch the tube and it said I did and I slam my kindle down every time. so if you don't like sensitive games don't get it.( its not as good as flappy BIRD)
B000O178BY|4|The first two tracks are a lot of random distortion with no vocals; I didn't particularily care for them or the way that they introduced the album. I prefer strong beats and a song that sucks you in from the very beginning. However, once you get past Hyperpower! and The Beginning of the End, the ingenuity and imagination that is uniquely Trent Reznor starts to appear (he also starts to sing). Rather than abstract distortion, there is beautiful fragmentation and calculated funk. I fell in love with the cd after the first two tracks were over.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It's a fun ever changing game that I play on my phone and the Kindle I actually like playing on the Kindle better because it's bigger and on the smaller phones you can get what I call &#34;Candy Crush Eye&#34; or blurred vision after playing too long.  It's great fun!
B00FAPF5U0|2|Fun for a while, then they cut you off and want you to buy further levels. Sucks . . .
B005I735ZM|3|Two complete Furtwangler Ring Cycles, and one Decca professional recording of Die Walkure, have been around on private and pirate records since the mid-1950s. Each has many unforgettable and magnificent moments, since each is conducted by Furtwangler but with entirely different orchestras and casts.<br /><br />My point is this: throw out every vinyl, tape, cd you own of these performances. The gold standard has been met. There is now only ONE great, technically and musically remastered version of each of these performances. Save your money and buy them all. Andrew Rose, with collaboration from master audiophile restorers Ward Marsten and Mark Obert-Thorn, have created a simply unsurpassable library of great musical performances, dating from the earliest cylinders to remastered cds. As they expand their catalogue, every great Furtwangler performance will be available in formats ranging from MP3 to 24-bit Ambient Stereo.<br /><br />I promise that you will listen to \\"old performances\\" remastered with such care, clarity, musical knowledge and taste that -- were Pristine better known -- no one would buy anything else. Incidentally they have done absolutely splendid jazz remasters, Broadway and television soundtracks -- anything you could ask for.
B001N26GFM|5|Very sad movie. Good.

1452101248|5|I got this cookbook right before a trip overseas so I lent it to a friend that was hosting a vegetarian dinner party.  She loved it so much that she immediately bought a copy and not only that, but the guests who she hosted loved her dinner so much that they bought it too.  Everything I've made from it so far has been a winner; the dishes are simple, but the flavors are so complex.
0553345834|4|I wish I had read this book as a freshly minted MBA. It would have alerted me to some speed bumps on the freeway of business.     McCormack is like a coach or a grandfather with extraordinary wisdom and experience taking you to a series of lunches to help guide your career.      It's not a ladder to success, but rather a valuable building block for a strong foundation. It's also an interesting insight into the sports management business.         Highly recommended.
B00DKY4LBW|2|When did Justin Timberlake join Arctic Monkeys? Does this mean they're going to go through a faux comedy phase? Oh boy.
6305263248|4|This is one of the smartest, most exciting action movies I've seen in years.  The car chases are amazing, the plot is very interesting, and the acting is first-rate.  I must say however that Deniro (one of my favorite actors) actually seems to be phoning it in little bit here compared with the other actors.  They actually seem to be more &quot;present&quot; in the situation than he is.  I'd highly recommend this movie and I'm surprised that it's not better known.
B004DI7HZ6|5|I read The Book of Life over the summer and had to go back and start again at the beginning. I guess this is a kind of &#34;time walking.&#34; The Discovery of Witches was richer and made so much more sense.
044100590X|5|DUNE is, simply put, a masterpiece.  It's also a legend with spawned a movie and two TV miniseries which are nearly as famous as the novel.  Frank Herbert's science fiction/fantasy tale centers around Paul Atreides, a young man who has recently moved to the planet Arrakis, better known as Dune, sometime in the far future.  Paul is the son of a duke, and after the duke is murdered in a raid by the evil Harkonnen family, Paul and his mother journey in to the desert.  From there, a prophecy shall be fulfilled and life as Herbert's characters know it, will change dramatically.<br />Never have I read a book as realistic as Dune.  It plays out almost like a historical fiction.  The characters are so real, with so much emotion, you can't help but believe these people may one day truly exist.<br />The story, which took in the first Nebula award, is complicated and may throw off some readers.  Indeed, the book itself may prove to be a challenge to many readers.  Unfortunately many will put down the book after the first about 100 pages, during which it is somewhat uninteresting.  But, if you should make it past those pages, you'll find one of the most interesting and life-like masterpieces of our time.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|This game is fun and easy to play. I like how your lives are renewed several times a day. It does seem to take a long time to load sometimes though. Overall I really like it.
B005ETA5K2|4|This has very good range and strong signal as my portable devices only get one or two bars, and it is very easy to install on mac and pc as I tried them both. One thing I was not aware of is that it needed two USB ports, thank goodness I had them or I would be buying a hub. There is one quark on my mac when I disconnect my iphone the Alfa shuts off, however you just go in utility click the off button and push on button after it shuts off and it works just fine. not sure about windows as I do not dock any portable device to them.

0061703257|3|I read the book after I saw the movie. Mistake. The movie provides too much of the plot, more interesting visuals, and a very handsome male lead to make the book worthwhile afterward.<br />I do applaud Lehane for his book, I'm sure if I had read it before I saw the movie I would have been completely enthralled with it.
B000001F2H|5|After finding the Yardbirds' direction too mainstream, Clapton searches to  keep his Blues chops growing.  Eric finds John Mayall and records some of  his most electrifying solos with this group. (He even meets Jack Bruce in a  later incarnation of the Blues Breakers.)  Please listen to &quot;Have You  Heard&quot; to prove this to yourself. Mayall provides his usual strong  vocal support and excellent musicianship. John McVie (later of Fleetwood  Mac) rounds out the group with strong blues-jazz bass lines. I personally  feel the Hugh Flint is the weak link, but is more than offset by John  Almond wonderful sax work. If you are a Clapton fan and have not heard his  early post-Yardbird work or if you are a blue fan of any sort, You should  own this one.

My only comment is that the display could be brightened up a little more but I also understand the clock is mainly designed for use in a dark bedroom. Weather information is an added benefit.
B003L77G06|5|This is one of the funniest sitcoms yet, because of the true meaning of families today and how diverse they are. It definitely keeps you laughing and I'm sure to own all seasons!
B00HAQAQME|2|I'm no Woody Allen fan, so wasn't going to watch this, then it was nominated and a friend raved about it.  The acting is good, especially Kate Blanchett, but this movie does nothing to inspire the viewer.  I know that criticizing  Allen is a no-no, but honestly, I don't find him talented.
B003G4W49C|5|I believe this was written for a much younger audience than myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thinking about the age of the main character and what the challenges were for him, makes me think we could challenge our young people in a much greater way.  Not to the extent of this fictional character, but challenge causes people to excel beyond what they normally would achieve.
B002RSQGQK|5|It is James Stewart What more needs to be said?
B00957T6X6|5|Great reads
B001FBSMF8|4|I was a bit skeptical when I heard about this album, but after hearing a couple songs played live and some interviews with Chis I decided to give it a chance.  And I'm sure glad I did!  This is a perfect synthesis of Timbaland's layered, mostly electronic sound and Chris' soulful voice, great melodies and killer lyrics.  Give this cd a chance and listen with an open mind, you will not be disappointed.
B0007GAERG|3|This CD is not as bad as some people suggest although it does fall short of a masterpiece... I give it three stars because I love all the songs on this album in which Mariah is collaborating with other artists, aside from that the rest of the CD falls absolutely flat.... Best songs: \\"It's like that\\", \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"One and Only\\"....one exception is \\"We Belong Together\\"; she comes off pretty well on that one (without anyone's help) but that's it....hopefully next time she will come out with a more satisfactory album.....

B0054JZC6E|4|I love this game. its a great pass time!! and its one of the only things u don't need wifi for..
B00005OAIE|5|First, let me say that I am quite surprised at the negative reactions to this CD.  I think it is wonderful, warm, and young, and find nothing wrong with that.<br />I have been a Beatles fan my whole life, and this, frankly, sets the bar rather high when it comes to new muscial acts.  John Mayer is only one of a handful I would put in this catagory with the Beatles.  No, he is not experimental, but he's young.  I don't think you have to be muscally mature at 25, because you are still a baby.  I am looking forward to a long career for John and many, many more great songs.<br />The songs on this CD are wonderful.  No Such Thing is an song I wish existed in when I was in high school.  It's final verse it a great payoff.<br />Why, Georgia, Why?, contrary to the top review, does stir.  I feel it captures the the constant questioning of identity that really is what your 20's are about.<br />Your Body is a Wonderland is beautiful and sensous.  And the way he delivers the line &quot;and bubblegum tongue,&quot; is wonderfully retro.  The poetry is also quite lovely.  Right up there with And I Love Her, IMHO.<br />As for the complainer about 83, yeah, it does sound like an old luchbox got thrown away and that inspired this song, about wishing to be six again when the world SEEMED so much simipler.  I think it is cool that he left the inspiriation for the song right in there.<br />Finally, the melodies he writes are as catchy.  He pays simple homage to his influences (note the line &quot;the sounds of sirens&quot;) and this seems to have been mistaken for a lack of originality.  Just remember, the Beatles did a lot of covers in there early days, they learned their lessons well and went on to be the teachers.  I think John has this same potential.
0743289684|5|An incredible book by and about an incredible woman. Bravo to Ms. Hirsi Ali, for daring to challenge the status quo of fundamentalist Islam and continuing to do so despite the great danger it has put her in. Read this book and you will REALLY appreciate the importance of the separation of church and state. I can imagine what a hell it would be living in a fundamentalist Christian nation with laws based on a strict interpretation of the Bible...especially as a woman and an atheist! While there is indeed beauty and morality to be found in religion, one does not need to be of any faith in order to feel awe at a sunrise or to follow the golden rule. Meanwhile, fundamentalism of any stripe begets ignorance, intolerance and abuse of those relegated to lesser status simply because of their gender, sexual orientation or opposing belief system.
B00J2VSS0C|2|This is similar to other hidden objects games. I think it's ok. I like other ones better though. It has a story line and mystery to solve as you progress.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excellent
0061950726|5|This is a great story. Read it twice. Interesting history of orphans in the USA that is not commonly known. Also read it with our book club. Everyone enjoyed the book. Highly recommend.

B008JJM88Q|5|This app is so fun! It's amazing how quickly it can actually figure out what character or person you are thinking of!
B0063IH60K|5|nice game certainly worth the price. combines strategy and luck. a very good selection of options. it can become addictive.

B00000064G|1|this record is all myth, no songs. after having heard about it being &quot;haunting&quot; for so many years, I finally picked it up. I played it over and over again looking for what others see in this album. here's what I heard: the kind of &quot;poetry&quot; that high school juniors write after reading about Sylvia Plath in English. this is mumbled while strumming the simplest guitar possible. the fact that the guy offed himself figures in much of the music's praise. to me, that's irrelevant. there's just no strong songs here. it's been a week since I've heard it and I can't remember a thing about it. this is after dozens of listens. it's utterly forgettable.
B005D9MUWY|5|This is the only app I've ever actually paid for. I got the trial a while back and finally purchased the full one. I text/email/research on my phone everyday for work (IT professional) and it has saved me 60,000 key strokes so far and that number keeps going up! I recommend it for someone who actively emails/texts mass amounts every day!

0307588335|1|I worked at Lehman for a long time.  There's some factual content is this book, but on the whole it's comical.  A friend told me this guy spends every interview he does justifying his qualifications - because he has none.  I've almost finished another Lehman book  called \\"The Murder of Lehman.\\"  It's also written by an insider who despite hiding behind a pseudonym comes across as totally genuine.  Looking at the reviews for this book, it seems the high ratings are from people who don't know much about finance and are seduced by a book co-authored with a thriller writer.  For all you finance guys and anyone else who gave just 1 star or maybe 2, The Murder of Lehman should be a far more satisfying read.  I'm thinking five stars so far.  Of course, the bar has been set very low.  Still, I've got to say that the prologue is brilliant and is a story I did not know.  And the chapter on Lehman after 9/11 could only have been written by someone who was there.  I was, and found the chapter stirring.

B0000CFW87|1|Hey everyone, I am very mad at Josh Groban and his new CD.  I was looking forward to listening to it when i bought it and when I played it for the first time i realized that this CD is not worth it.  He is off key, sings in Italian (this is America speak English) and is SOOOO ugly.  His hair looks like poop.  This compact disk is just so horrible i want to warn people out there that they are going to waste their money.

B009X01ELC|4|Having bought the Kindle Fire 8.9\\" HD, I needed a stand to help read it at night, in bed or at the table.<br /><br />This cover is well built, fairly priced, and does exactly what it should. The convenience of being able to rotate the device within the cover allows it to be propped upright oR sideways. The rotation also allows the slot for the connections to be accessible from the outside. This design is far superior - IMHO - than covers that have a \\"flap\\" that extends to allow the cover to stand.<br /><br />It also has a strap designed to enable an easier grip on the cover and to allow for one handed use.<br /><br />Nice cover, I like it a lot. The only flaw is the weight of the cover. Because it has the rotational piece, it is a bit heavier than other covers. Not sure how you could get around that and still have a quality cover. Worth buying.
B00J1IQUYM|3|Overall, I enjoyed this nove and found it easy to read.  I found the novel to be interesting with multiple storylines. These storylines eventually connected.  There were several characters who I really enjoyed learning about, even if I didn't understand them. I don't want to comment too much on the ending in efforts to avoid being a spoiler, but I would have preferred something different. Nonetheless, I found myself going back to this story in my mind, even several weeks later.
B0002OERI0|1|The music sucks and the political message is worse. [...] The Guitar sound is complete crap and the singing is juvenile and whiney. This album is a perfect example of society in decline.
1575666286|4|I wasn't quite expecting this after seeing the movie. Very technical. It will be a long read for me. I didn't realize either that one is expected to drink 13 cups of juice a day among other things. I guess if you are ill enough and have help this would be good.
B00ARAO0WM|2|I wanted some mindless entertainment one evening. I found it -- with a bonus lame &#34;love&#34; story.<br /><br />Some of the cycling scenes were good, but hardly good enough to support this turkey.<br /><br />Jason Gordon-Levitt was compelling in Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. He shows a few glimmers of depth in this movie but given the script, I wouldn't expect much more from Brando.<br /><br />If you need something on during a party, have the flu, or just like &#34;super bad cool kids versus mean old white bad cops&#34; flicks, rent this.
0140131558|5|How do you discuss a mystery that's not a mystery?  More importantly, how do you WRITE three mysteries that aren't?  And still manage to create involving, memorable, and deeply disturbing novels?  I don't know how, but Paul Auster has figured out.  In the space of three short novels, Auster has developed mysteries that are more concerned with ideas than plot, with the style of writing rather than the content.  He has, in short, written THE NEW YORK TRILOGY.<br />Describing the plots does no justice to the novels (they are, after all, practically plotless), but I will endeavor to summarize.  CITY OF GLASS tracks Quinn, a frustrated novelist who agrees to accept a detective case, after being mistaken for the detective Paul Auster.  GHOSTS follows the exploits of Blue, a detective hired by White to spy on Black, for reasons which remain obscure.  THE LOCKED ROOM is centered on an author who has been charged with the task of tending to an old friend's vast literary output, after the friend has mysteriously vanished from civilization.<br />As mentioned previously, these novels ARE mysteries, on their surfaces.  (That's initially what drew me to their pages.)  But Auster isn't concerned with the intricacies of the detective genre.  He is far more fascinated with the image of the author, that person who creates people out of thin air and smoke.  Auster delves into what the make-up of such a person may be, a person who's public character is defined by the artistic output, not by whom the author actually is.  Who the author actually may be, or what the author's opinion is as to his or her own writings, is not important.  It is a schizophrenic life, to be sure, and Auster knows it.  Are we defined by our inner monologue, or do our actions govern our identities?  Is who we purport to be as important as how we appear to be?<br />CITY OF GLASS is an excellent example of Auster's musings on this theme.  As Quinn slowly begins to develop his detective persona, he can feel his previous author persona begin to slip away.  By his inadvertent creation of a new persona, he erases his past; but as he was only really defined by his novels, it is a far easier task than it first appeared.  This culminates in an exploration of the inner workings of personal discovery that reminds me of nothing so much than Arthur C. Clarke's elliptical finale to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.<br />Is it environment, or public perception, or biology that determines what we turn out to be?  Auster interweaves this theme into all three of his novels.  The character of Stillman, in CITY OF GLASS, is so obsessed with this idea that he deprived his son of any form of contact, trying to discover the hidden, secret language of God.  Fanshawe, in THE LOCKED ROOM, is determined that he distance himself from what he was perceived to be, unwilling to accept anyone's characterization of his psyche.  Blue, in GHOSTS, discovers that what he fears the most is true, that his existence is his job; outside of that, nothing he thinks or feels has any effect.<br />Mind you, none of this would raise the themes above the quality of a academic treatise without Auster's remarkable writing ability.  While he may be loathe to be judged by his output, the fact remains that Auster can relate a story with the best of them.  His characters, while purposefully vague, still manage to create an empathy with the reader.  The quest for identity, that search for the ego, is a universally understandable topic.  Auster achieves the feat of simultaneously having the characters understand themselves at the same time that the reader does.  Any discussion of the past is irrelevant, it's the NOW that matters.  The author in THE LOCKED ROOM gradually understands this in his quest for the missing friend Fanshawe.  What he discovers about Fanshawe only serves to confuse.  Perhaps he was better off with his own personal memories, rather than try to incorporate the recollections of others.<br />Auster also realizes that one's opinions about a novel can differ from another's; it makes no difference.  What is important is what YOU thought, not what others may tell you to think.  The NEW YORK TRILOGY seems designed to provoke different responses, alternate beliefs as to what it all means.  I personally haven't been privy to such a possibility as to the ultimate meaning of a thing since witnessing Peter Greenaway's remarkable film THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER.  What does it all ultimately mean?  Who knows?  What's important is that it affected me, on a level I wasn't expecting.  It is a pleasant surprise.'s opinions about a novel can differ from another's; it makes no difference.  What is important is what YOU thought, not what others may tell you to think.

B009GEBBNQ|3|Good comic book on screen, but I suppose I just could not keep my interest in this film. I am sure younger viewers may like this more.
B002SJKWZ4|5|I bought this as a gift who is a big fan of Harry Potter. It went over well. I don't know how often they use it, but it's worth the first reaction you get.
B00FAX6XQC|5|I love this game. Lllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeee this game. You should try it if you don't have it. Best game in the world!!!!!
0596009208|5|This is by far the best text book I have ever read. The book was engaging, well written, and intuitive. I cannot recommend this book enough if you are interested in learning JAVA and have only a little programming background.
B008F5Y7UQ|5|Really enjoyed this sweet film, even if I didn't agree with some of the characters choices. ;)
B004SBX112|3|Old review:  This was not what I paid for. A season oriented game without seasonal updates is pointless. The recent update won't let me even open the game. When I could play it, it was fun.<br /><br />Update: After a few tries of updating and re-installing, the game is working well again. I've fallen out of the habit of playing, but did try multiple holidays and levels to revise my review. The seasons are cute enough and the graphics are of good quality. I do wish the change between games and reset of games went faster.
B0088T3B0G|5|One of the best thrillers as a movie.  Twist and turns abound.
B0085Z8F4A|5|I ordered this Sunday and received it Tuesday with Standard shipping. It came unopened, like it should have, and not damaged. I haven't watched it yet because it's a present for my boyfriend, but I know it will be good. Such a great deal too $20 for 4 different formats, so awesome.
B0000025D0|5|'Darkness' is the second in the trilogy of albums (along with 'Born to Run' and 'The River') which truly defined his career.  On 'Darkness', gone are all of the production headaches and stress that went into the making of  'Born to Run'.  What you have are ten tracks delivered from the heart of  New Jersey's most honest working class hero.  The songs are less safe and  more gut-wrenching then on 'Born to Run'.  'Something in the Night' and  'Racing in the Street' bring to life the theme of the wandering man, his  girl and his car.  Seems so simple, but his stories are so compelling.   'Darkness' also demonstrates a completely new level of musicianship for the  Boss.  The guitar solos are obviously one-takes with passion and hardness.   When he sings 'I lost my money and I lost my wife - them things don't seem  to matter to much to me now' in the title track, you just can't deny the  soul of this album.  Buy it!
B00S2SYTR2|5|Only a commie would not see the humor and great entertainment this film provides. It's also great seeing a new original idea brought to the screen that is extremely entertaining as well.
0743298039|4|4.5<br />At first I found this book very boring, the story did not catch me instantly, I must admit that in the second half of the book there's so much that happens that I could not help to keep reading. As I read on I realized the mysteries surrounding the history of Miss Winter, and made my own conclusions and theories. Of course I wasn't right, in fact the vast majority of my theories were wrong. There are so many plot twists in the last 70 pages and it adds the exciment to the last details of this mystery.  An excellent outcome, all doubts are clarified and the mysteries solved, really liked it!
B005OCFGTO|5|Grandkids love it!
B008IJTFYW|5|Great selection of natural sounds and soothing music loops.  The best part is that you can mix and match several of your favorites to make your own personalized mix tape.  You can't buy a white noise machine with these capabilities--and this is free!
B00APUYN0I|5|A very funny movie great with the whole family!
B0064MPXFA|4|Juliana Margullies (sp?) gives a wonderful and credible performance.  The story lines are intriguing.
0385535139|4|My mother is probably John Grisham's #1 fan so when he releases a new one she gets it as a gift which was the case with this. I can't really review the content, but the recipient of this book was super pleased.
B00FAPF5U0|1|This game is worthless. And even worse when I went to download it, it said I couldn't download it because it need 6gg. UGH and its soooo boring. how do people like it?
B00DJFIMW6|1|this game stinks because it takes to long to load up. so don't get this game ever. so yeah there u go.
068484267X|5|I loved this book. It was really sad and funny at the same time. It really shows the poverty and strife of the people in Ireland, and I recommend it to anyone. I can't wait for the next to come out in paperback.
B0070DOHQS|4|I love the idea of the app, it is really one of my favorites but I did notice a small problem with the sensitivity of it. Its hard to get some of the commands to work because it doesn't recognize what I am doing for some reason. But I like it and I am hoping that they work out the bugs!!
B002ZG974W|5|I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law and daughter.  They watch it with their 3 year old over and over and find it to be an excellent film. Not only is it &#34;historically&#34; a fine look at babies the world round, but it is also the kind of film that generates conversation in a family.  My purchase was the Blu-ray version and I ended up having to buy them a blu-ray player to watch it- so make sure you buy the appropriate version.
B004MC8CA2|4|I have used YouVersion on iPhone and Kindle Fire.  It has been reliable, stable, and very easy to use.  I would rather the scrolling be horizontal on the Kindle to match the device's normal pattern.

B0095P33IW|5|Great movie with great special effects. I liked the beginning that had Captain America small it seem like it was all true.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Love this game!

B008D30K7E|4|Enjoyable read, cheerful and uplifting especially for the older reader. Perhaps a bit too long!
B00127RAJY|5|Jillian Michaels puts out quality workout DVD's.  I love the 30-Day Shred and go through  the program.  Do something else.  And, then do it again.  I  never get tired of it.  You have to have at least an intermediate level of fitness for these workouts.  Even level one has some difficulty to it.<br /><br />Jillian uses different muscle groups at the same time to cut down on the workout time length.  I like that because I workout at home before work.  I don't always have time to work out for one hour or more.<br /><br />The modified moves are all done by one of the other girls in the DVD.  This makes it easy to do the exercises that may be difficult for you.<br /><br />All you need is a mat and a light set of hand weights and a small area and you're set.  I've gotten great results from this DVD set.
B0015DYIH2|5|As with the previous three volumes, Stephenie Meyer's gift for story telling completes the saga with excitement, suspense, and the need to know what happens next.<br /><br />The alternative ending portrayed in the movie made for a good visual ending, but lacked details that made the written series so fantastic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, as well as the entire saga. It is very well written, and I hope to read more from this talented author.
B00BQ1DBUS|4|Almost 60 and still love to listen to music.  These days, not much out thats good-a lot of crap... Saw Rod had a latest release. Listened to samples on Amazon and from there, thought not bad.  Just bought CD and listened all the way through. Really, really enjoyed it. Had good upbeat, up tempo songs and even enjoyed the slower songs.  What a good surprise.  Read several \\"Reviews\\" over internet, most giving the record 2.5 out of 5.  Think they missed this one.  Enjoy this more than other cd's recently purchased.  Way to go Rod...

B00HGJ18C2|5|Did not order this...
B000002I25|5|This album set into play the two ingredients that The Doors are most know for.The dark emotional content, and the unique organ sound.I haven't heard either of these two elements pursued to the intensive degree that they're pursued here.Although I'm aware of many artists singing about death and suffering, I don't know of it being approached in such a philosophical manner.Which is not to say that Morrison's poems neccesarily make a cohesive storyline over the span of a whole song.It's more that each sentence is potent as a stand-alone, a poem in itself.I find an artistic similarity in the directing style of film-maker Stanley Kubrick.His films don't always form a singular story-line, but they are full of inspirational and unforgettable scenes.BUT... (Yes, I do feel that capital letters were called for) definetely not all of Morrison's lyrics are philosophical.An equal amount is blatantly sexual (some of which lyrics belong to the guitarist Krieger).And his singing (though it has no leanings towards Pavarotti or Carreras) is fully successful at putting these two contrasting mindsets across.He undoubtedly has a strong presence.(I'll leave it up to you to decide if it's pretention or genuinity.For mine, the genuinity sings to me loudest of the two).<br />The organ style of Manzarek is unreplicated in contemporary music.At least, I've never heard anything like it, except in The Animals' version of \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\".The jazz world's usage of organ is probably the nearest brother.And, although much is said about the blues and jazz roots of this band, very little is mentioned of the classical music influence.Manzarek's organ arrangements resemble baroque era harpsichord and church organ music.I wasn't at all surprised when I found out that he was a fan of, and influenced by, J.S Bach.<br />The drumming of Densmore is very 'spicey' by rock standards.He's not generally credited as one of the greatest drummers of all-time (by the masses, anyway).But, pushing the parcel 'creatively' is always going to mean a trade-off in 'performance' practice.Nevertheless, his performances are still quite excellent.He obviously has an ear for latin jazz, and was very imaginative in applying it to rock music. eg.The \\"Break On Through\\" beat stemmed from a latin tune called \\"Embarcadero\\", which used a quiet brushing, instead of The Doors' heavy CRACK! (or, click!) and speeding cymbals.This here reviewer rates Densmore very highly.<br />Krieger's guitaring is often lazily played underneath the organ on this album.And it's even lazier in concert.It's as if his hands were accidentally numbed at the dentist surgery.But his guitaring comes alive in the well-drilled solos, which are often incredible.He was a bit new to the instrument when The Doors began, so it appears to me that he wasn't so accomplished at the less practiced rhythm parts.But he was an excellent composer, and this intelligence definitely shines through via his choices in notation and phrasing.<br />The Doors hired in session bassists for their albums, which I think were never up to par.I actually love the organ taking the bass-line role at concerts.But the band seemed to believe that the organ wasn't the way to go.An example of how effective the organ's bass could be, is on their live performance of \\"Who Do You Love\\".I think that was the most effective bass work that The Doors ever produced.<br />The Doors linger on the border of complexity and simplicity.For mine, they are as 'intricate' as musicians have gotten without losing their 'rock' status.For others, they were a little too obscure, which leads many to deem Morrison pretentious.Personally I don't dismiss people saying that, as nobody (including Morrison) is totally void of pretention.(Which isn't to say that it 'can't' happen).But I do think that they are missing his genuinity, which is definitely there to be found.In concerts he may have gotten carried away at times.But I find him to have been genuine when it came to his studio performances.(Though I'm not impressed by the new remastered edition vocal track on \\"The End\\".I think the original recording is far more credible without it).I'm aware that non-fans hate when Doors fans call this band 'deep', possibly because the 'depth card' is spread on a bit thick at times (even by the band itself).But this overplay aside, I do believe that 'depth' is a fitting description for what this band set out to do.They didn't excude the common garden variety rock mentality.(And yes, I am aware that they engaged the common garden variety rock 'diet'.But \\"You are NOT what you eat\\", even if cliches say that you ARE).I'm not impressed by the new remastered edition vocal track on \\"The End\\".I think the original recording is far more credible without it).I'm aware that non-fans hate when Doors fans call this band 'deep', possibly because the 'depth card' is spread on a bit thick at times (even by the band itself).But this overplay aside, I do believe that 'depth' is a fitting description for what this band set out to do.They didn't excude the common garden variety rock mentality.(And yes, I am aware that they engaged the common garden variety rock 'diet'.But \\"You are NOT what you eat\\", even if cliches say that you ARE).

I'm not a kid, but I guess I have the heart of a kid because this is pretty awesome to me at least. Doesn't need complicated features like others are suggesting, keep it nice and simple.
B00CHVJI08|4|This was not a  great movie - but not a bad one either - it was something fresh and that's why i liked it.  It was like Ice age, but with people instead of animals
B00FN811SY|5|Awesome app. Love it:)
B00ELOOYZI|4|If you use the Test Drive, you will be able to see the actual game/simulation, so I highly recommend trying it first. It has a great tutorial that covers each section of the process of building the rocket. For the in-depth tutorial alone, it is worth at least two stars.<br /><br />It is more than simply a rocket launching program. You can also try your hand at landing (on the smoon) and even working with wheels like a lunar rover. However, the skills required to determine the proper launch (through atmosphere and against the pull of the earth) make this hard for little kids. However, teens and adults will find this a great way to pass some time. It is a challenge. Great game play is a star, holding back one star due to time it takes to really understand what you need to do.<br /><br />There are no annoying permissions, so another star. Overall, great game, even if you don't get it as the FAOTD.
B006GLLREU|5|best show ever!
B009OYSFDM|5|Loved it! Great for any superhero fan! very Batman in nature. Takes a lot of cues from Smallville but starts the story of  Green Arrow from scratch.

B0084YAU86|5|If you aren't already watching Sherlock....get on board. This show, in only 6 episodes, is a fantastic series that embodies all we love about Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist. This Season 2 finale is a riveting conclusion to the season and only leaves fans like myself DESPERATELY waiting for season 3 to be filmed and aired! Cumberbatch is the perfect Holmes and I cannot imagine anyone besides Freeman in the role of Watson.
1400052181|5|This is the kind of story that stays with you. Henrietta Lacks was an impoverished black woman living in the deep South who died young from a very aggressive form of cancer. Cells taken from her prior to her death went on to have an extraordinary affect on medical science, leading to new discoveries, new treatments, and new hope for peole suffering from a number of illnesses. Rebecca Skloot digs deep to find the story behind the story, and her odyssey is almost as interesting as the life of Henrietta Lacks' cells. Skloot traced the details back through the years, in order to give us a rich understanding of Lacks' life and times. Then Skloot brings things forward, to show not only the journey of the cells, but the plight of Lacks' descendants. While some companies have made considerable profits on the medical developments that used Lacks' cells, her children and grandchildren are, for the most part, impoverished and uninformed about their mother's contribution to medical science. In the irony of ironies, Lack's family members have serious illnesses yet are without health insurance. Skloot is to be congratulated on this accomplishment. Her research is impeccable and her storytelling is riveting.
B00BAXFJ5M|4|Very exciting read.  I was a little disappointed with ending. I thought it was a little flat and predictable.  Overall I liked it very much.
B00W3V83QW|4|Love this game and glad it was released for the kindle. Please consider releasing pyramid solitaire saga , papa pear saga , diamond digger saga ,  pepper panic saga , and candy crush soda saga for the kindle as well.  When I have facebook friends wanting me to send lives for any of the games I can't because the apps are not free for my kindle so I could help them in the game . Please do consider releasing more king limited games like the ones I mentioned. Thank you .

B00BB8SKPW|5|Truly an indepth perspective of the burden of alcoholism and it's impact to not just the sufferer.  But also all those that are touched by the disease.
0786838655|4|Question about the book:  I have a young son with ADHD who likes this style of writing.  I see in the book's description that the half-blood kids are only safe at one camp.  Do you feel this will be frightening to a boy with ADHD who might identify with the character?  Or is it not as frightening a theme as I am imagining?
B00NIIT87C|5|Great, great, great.  &#34;Sugar&#34; is new favorite.
B00I0C46BO|5|I started reading this book because of a blog post of a person I'm following. She was very thrilled with this book and could not stop telling how it helped her to make her home a better place. I myself was really tired of tidying: I live with my family in a really small apartment, and even a thought that I need to wash floors was making me sad and almost in panic. Konmari is right: you would be shocked on how many unnecessary things people possess.<br />I couldn't clean in \\"one go\\" as Marie suggests, neither I liked her shinto accusations, but overall the book made a miracle for me. It's like Allen Carr for housekeepers -)
B00CWY76CC|4|Really enjoyed playing...liked the challenge and creativity.  Hope more levels are added soon! Quite the challenge if you are a beginner
B00DW3GAEC|5|Still one of the best movie about Pearl Harbor ever made. Now in HD I notice things I never saw before .
B00BAXFECK|4|Really great book!  Couldn't put it down at the start, beautiful imagery, emotional response and connection to the characters. Really great specifics.  Sort of lagged a bit towards the middle, then REALLY picked up at the end with a super awesome, suspenseful, roller coaster of an ending!  Definitely recommend reading!  :)
B00AECDDYY|4|The only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it sometimes doesn't register when I cluck to upgrade a tower or town. This sounds silly, but in this kind of game it can be crucial. once that's fixed, it's hands-down five stars.
B00MJ10VX4|5|Awesome
0762451319|4|Get what you pay for, but worth the money. Comes with all things shown. Necklace turned green after a few weeks, but expected it.
B0001Z52RU|4|If you like the off-the-wall movie, check this one out.  By off-the-wall, I mean anything from FIGHT CLUB or THE BEACH to DONNIE DARKO.<br /><br />Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who, after suffering childhood blackouts, discovers a way of stepping back into his past through self-hypnosis.  When he tries to help other kids and their traumas by changing his past, he wakes up in an altered present filled with radical, sometimes-horrible differences.<br /><br />Sounds complicated, but the movie's pretty easy to follow (just pay attention).<br /><br />The DVD comes with the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut.  The endings are different but they both worked for me.<br /><br />Cool story.
0756686970|5|My grandson almost wore out Ninjago Encyclopedia.  Now on to Star Wars.  After reading with one adult, he loves to share what he's learned with another family member.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Always liked solitaire.  Enjoy playing this one as well. Better  than mindless slots.
B006JSXYPA|5|this is a must-own bluray. looks killer and sounds incredible. definitely a great way to show off your system and the story resonates with our current economic and political problems when it feels like evil has already won.
B006YXTRHY|5|Such a great movie!
B00FAPF5U0|4|I really enjoy playing the game. it is very addictive. I just wish you did not have to wait so long in between for your life to restart.
B001NLKWLW|3|This was a light read, but interesting.
B009949RKC|4|We recently watched Carrie for the first time.  Although it seems somewhat dated, it is still a worthwhile movie.  Sissy Spacek gives a fine performance as Carrie, a sheltered girl who grows up and tries to deal with classmates who bully her.
B00BFUUMO8|2|i was able to play this for a short time on my kindle fire, but after that I couldn't get past the load screen. Was a lot of fun while i could play it though!
B00CSR2J9I|4|Good little game. Great way to pass some time and not have to think about what your doing just gas brake and go
B00BC5I6Q2|5|Interesting, awe inspiring, maybe more truth than imagined
B007IXWL2C|5|Hold your attention, couldn't put it down.  The last book was just as interesting as the first.  Can wait for  more of her work.
B006VFLIYK|5|This was one of Baldacci's best stories yet.  Very fast-paced and I couldn't put it down.  Lots of action and twists and turns, liked the characters and plot and it was one of those stories that took you fast and held you right straight through to the end.  I love the way he brings a human touch to a hardened loner and assassain. I have read nearly all of his books and this was by far one of my all time favorites.
B008JGSM6G|5|I have spent many hours playing this game.  I only have about 60 more games to have this group completed.  It may take me a long time to finish as i am now in the very difficult ones.  I am determined to keep at it until I get that all.
B008Y78GYI|1|I love the movie, but the video was totally BLANK!!  Other movies have been playing on my internet enabled TV, but not this one.
B005EJNAO0|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE Bruce Willis! Best show ever!!!!!!
1423140605|5|The book I ordered was perfect condition. My daughter was estactic.  Can't wait to get the whole set for next year.
B00AE5R2NO|5|Bought this for my 3 year old who is in love with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It keeps your mind working during the tie your are playing this great game. Better than angry birds I think.
B00C7O8TSM|3|I wish someone would define the word \\"live\\" as applied to music recordings supposedly done before audiences and outside the normal recording studio environment.  Anyone foolish enough to believe that this or any other \\"live\\" recording by a pop-rock group in the past 30 years has not been \\"doctored up\\" in the studio after the fact....well,  may you continue to enjoy your ignorant bliss.  I've been an audio engineer and a professional musician for half a century. Sorry folks, but most of what you hear here vocally happened many weeks after the actual concert, back in the recording studio.  Fact:  all of the original Beach Boys are in their 60's and none of them can sing anywhere near as good as they could 40 years ago.  The guy who saves this band live is Jeffrey Foskett, with his near-perfect replication of Brian's once choirboy-like falsetto.  Even with that, 80% of the vocals on this album have been re-recorded after the fact.  But what really makes my skin crawl is the amount of Auto-Tune being used.  Auto-Tune is the most heinous invention in audio history.  It completely removes the soul and the beautiful imperfection of the human voice.  Auto-tuned harmony vocals are totally lifeless and artificial sounding.  40 years ago, the Beach Boys produced incredibly beautiful, shimmering harmonies and they did it without any Auto-Tune.  It's the slight imperfections between multitracked vocals that create the beautiful, rich  thickness that's absent from the vocals on this recording.  But the \\"industry standards\\" now dictate what everybody's recordings have to sound like to be publicly acceptable.  I wasn't a fan of Joe Thomas's production on \\"Imagination\\", and I sure don't like it on this one.  There's no real \\"punch\\" or power.  For a 13 piece band with 5 guitar players, I expected a little more excitement.  I guess I am alone in my belief that there's no crime in a having a couple of mistakes or off-key notes on a recording - that it reminds me that I am listening tohumans and not machines.  I actually breathed a sigh of relief when I heard Mike D'Amico's bass mistake a minute-five into \\"Hawaii\\", so I guess the music tracks are all the original live ones.  Even the audience response sounds \\"canned\\" in places.  All that said, I grew up with the Beach Boys and their music changed my life.  I've bought everything they've ever done and will continue to do so because I love 'em to death.  I hope this album makes them lots of money and their fans happy, but I much prefer listening to the studio versions of their stuff.<br /><br />Additions:  After more careful listening, I'm finding a ton of mistakes on bass guitar.  Don't know who because there were 3 different rotating bass players on the tour; Mike D'amico, Probyn Gregory, and someone else I can't remember now...but you'd think someone would have patched up the bass clams on this release.
0143038419|3|I picked up this book based on a friend's recommendation. I read the first chapter, which prompted me to buy the book, due to its comical and sarcastic tone. I could identify with her in a lots of respects, but as the book progressed I became exceedingly more annoyed with her general attitute that expressed nothing more than, \\"Poor me. I have to live in an ashram in India for another three months. Boohoo. Poor me. My marriage is falling apart and I have all this money to travel the world, but I'm dissapointed in everything... Waaaaaaa\\". Mindless and constant complaining. I got tired of hearing her complain about everything midway through India... I felt like I wanted to tell her to get over herself.    However, the reason I give it 3 stars is because it was entertaining and humorously written, and I did like it at first. Perhaps if I made it past India it would've redeemed itself, but I had to put the book down halfway through (a rare occurance for me).
B008CABKSQ|5|A wonderful album that I didn't know existed. It's a must have if you like either one of these artists.
B004G600A4|5|Disney has always been an innovator in animation & with good reason.<br /><br />They have been the best at creating the '\\"illusion of reality\\" better than anyone else.<br />They have always been on the cutting edge of animation techniques.<br />They have always had the best voice casting.<br />They have always had the best songs.<br /><br />In short-they are the best in animation.<br /><br />And that tradition continues with the movie \\"Tangled\\"<br /><br />Disney & Pixar made history by creating the very first animated movie created completely by computer-TOY STORY, & it's very successful sequels, Toy Story 2 & 3.<br /><br />Their use of CGI, (Computer Graphics Imagery), has reached new heights in TANGLED.<br /><br />I remember seeing a behind the scenes story of the creation of Monsters Inc, where they had been talking about the effort that it took in creating the individual hairs on Sully's body-getting them to move as freely as real hair would.<br /><br />This has been taken to new lengths, (no pun intended), in TANGLED, a retelling of the Rapunzel story.<br /><br />We have to begin with Rapunzel's hair.

B00127RAJY|5|This is a really good workout video.  If you are pressed for time and want a good work out, get this DVD you will not be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book is AMAZING! You should defiantly buy this book- you will love it! I have NEVER read a book I loved as much as Mockingjay- and the whole Hunger Games series for that matter!
B00DPM7TIG|5|Wonderfully written. Definitely had an impact on me. Beautiful characters throughout the novel. In the darkest of times, literally and figuratively, we must remember the light is still there!
B0086700CM|5|this was the first game the kids picked out for their kindles.<br />i bought 3 kindles but the game will only download to 1 of them
B008JGSM6G|5|If you like brain teasers, you'll LOVE this!
B0076HNMU0|5|Original, entertaining, ground-breaking for television at the time (and better than most of anything out there now).....definitely a must see.
B00FAX6XQC|3|Awesome game with terrific graphics, however, stage 4 glitches on my kindle so bad I had to delete and redownload so hopefully it will work better this time. The game is so fun, I'm hooked
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game, it is so addicting and fun.  Great way to pass the time. My kids watch me play and often cheer me on.  My six year old loves it as well.
B004IJZFP4|4|Having lived, breathed, obsessed, admired, loved and promoted the original version of this album since it's initial release in 1975, I was excited and thrilled to learn of this release. Teaser (the orig.) is like an old friend to me. I know every note, every lyric, every vocal inflection, every musical nuance...and they all are as welcome and familar as that old friend...but...this recording, while close...ain't ever gonna be that. There are too many changes that are unsettling to me...while it's Bolin and as far as I'm concerned, he could fart with the least bit of sincerity and I'd like it...to take a masterpiece and alter it is almost sacrilegious. It's like putting drool at the corner of Mona Lisa's smile. Gone is the flowing jazzy guitar and vocals on Savannah Woman, the wonderful smoothness of Dreamer with it's Elton-ish piano intro, and everything else that made Teaser the extraordinary album it is. Am I glad to have this release? Yes...is it what I'd hoped it would be? No. What I wish they'd done is remaster...not remix...the original to bring the volume up and clarify the instruments and vocals, then release this somewhat bastardization of a release as a bonus disc...now that would indeed be DELUXE! I give it 4 stars because it is Tommy Bolin after all...and it's far far far superior to a sincere fart.
B00AESN8XY|5|interesting
B00004XMTJ|3|I didn't realize it was not a film of one of the Broadway plays.  The price was very high. I would recommend a lesser cost video.
B007SYWFRM|4|fun app to pass the time just wish opportunities to gain more nuts or trade coins for them exists.<br />love scratch game and the recent expansion....there is a lot more interaction.
B00L9B7IKE|3|Too  long and detailed, but kept reading because it was a good premise . However, interesting characters that keep ypu reading but too strung out.
B0090EHVMC|5|My daughter, who is a toddler, loves the little forest bears. It is a good way for older children (ages 5+) to learn how to care for the enviroment.
B000EGF0NW|4|I got this book for my sister and she likes to read it. Its a very interesting book and it was in not too bad of shape.
B0015UKX7E|5|This concert is so good. It gets boring at times but overall it's a very good excellent concert to watch. He does some old songs (Purple Rain) and he does some new songs accorrding to when this dvd came out (The Greatest Romance Ever Sold). This DVD comes with innerviews and some bonus clips of the concert which is cool. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to sit for over 2 hours to watch Prince and his friends perform.
B00004STPT|5|If you liked the movie, you will love the soundtrack.  This soundtrack is simply one of the best soundtrack's i have ever own.  The movie and the soundtrack should be together.  Can't just live with one.
B00MNYTWMI|5|Great game, addictive and very fun.
0684801558|5|Great book for any Fitzgerald fan!  This was my guide to living life in my twenties, lol!  I've heard it called a hard book to read, and I can see that.  But there is great satisfaction upon finishing the book.  I guarantee it!
B00634GHJA|1|I'm not sure if it is the app/program or the kindle, but I can't get the transfer to work.  It is most frustrating!!
0684847248|5|On many occasions during the 1980's, I tried to read this book and for some reason I could not really get into it. It just didn't grab me. Then one day I was visiting an Audio book rental store and the owner told me that &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; was the most rented audio book in  the entire store. So I rented it and this time it really got to me. Sure,  Peck is a psychotherapist and he presents his views using his experiences  in his career to reinforce his views. However, you will finish this  material learning more about yourself and others than you know right now.  One of the revelations I still remember from this book is that our views of  God are based on our views of our parents. I highly recommend the  unabridged audiobook. Listen and learn.
B0094BB4TW|5|How could anyone not like facebook?? It is a great place to catch up with old friends and make new ones. Great games too!!
0345803485|1|As a former bookseller, I like to read any new book that has a lot of \\"buzz\\" surrounding it, so I picked up Fifty Shades. I read enough to get the idea and see what the fuss was about, but had no interest in the characters, topic or what might happen so I stopped. Any more would have been hours of my life I could not have gotten back. The topic is scintillating but the writing was so awful I couldn't stand it. (How many times can one \\"bite her bottom lip\\"?) I went to a party with a lot of booksellers about a week later and we all felt the same way. I know a lot of women who have read all three books and they say the books were \\"just fun\\". I think I can find other books that are fun, sexy and well written.
6304795254|5|Great, engaging, edge-of-your-seat kind of movie.  Loved the location filming in San Francisco.  I was terrified right up to the bitter end.  Stop reading the reviews before you come across a spoiler.  See the movie first!
B00102F5WK|3|Extraordinary rendition as a tool in the war on terror and its implications for due process and the rule of law, the issue of torture, and the fundamental problem of individual rights versus public safety are all serious and important topics that deserve a better treatment than this movie. Actually, the brief documentary about rendition cases which accompanies the movie on the DVD does a much better job than the movie itself in addressing these issues.  The cast represents considerable talent, and the acting is just fine. The problem is with the writing. This would've been a much better movie if it had focused on the rendition case itself; instead, that almost becomes a sideshow in the drama of the subplot involving the interrogator's daughter and her boyfriend. It is understandable that the writer felt the necessity to include a real terrorist plot alongside the extraordinary rendition and torture in order not to be accused of being completely one-sided, but this dilutes the impact of the rendition story. And in the end, the rendition plot is \\"solved\\" in a very unsophisticated manner. So while being mildly entertaining, this film was a disappointment overall.
B00B99KJR0|4|It is one of the better free games I have gotten, and that is all I have to say. Twenty.
B005544TRQ|5|Great Series.  I have always liked lawyer shows and this is a good one.
B0098HGNGG|5|I love it.  It seems to be accurate and it is quite easy to use.
B002ZCDR88|5|Ok. I get it. Part of the reason for so diverse a collection of songs from a somewhat homogenous group of poems is Merchant's desire to show her virtuosity in a variety of styles. I can imagine no other reason for including, for instance, The King of China's Daughter, except to allow Merchant to show her skill in rendering a Chinese song. Nor can I figure out why the Dancing Bear is done up klezmer (since the poem is actually about a gypsy camp), except that Merchant wanted to do klezmer. And the Whomping Window Blind gives her a shot at a hornpipe. And Reggae, for a Topsyturvey World? Really? And a zydeco version of Ogden Nash? The Janitor's Red-haired Boy as a torch song? Of course.<br />The thing that most threatened the project for me was when I heard she was setting Gerard Manley Hopkins' Fall and Spring to music. That could have brought the house crashing down. And didn't. Part of the reason is that Merchant surrounds Hopkins somber verse with sad and reflective songs that defuses Hopkins' lyric explaining to a young girl that she is a sinner and is going to die, making it feel less heinous.<br />This is not to say that the whole album is a monument to Merchant's ingenuity. There are a number of songs that are straightforward in the beauty of the song writing. I really can't imagine Equestrienne set to music any other way. And the first time I heard It Makes a Change, I could not resist a giggle (I assure you, I am a stern old gent not given to giggling). The Nursery Rhyme of Innocence and Experience is exquisitely understated, as is If No One Marries Me.<br /> All in all, it is a very fun ride. It is a very ambitious project carried off with skill and aplomb. They say that the true artist makes the impossible look effortless. Merchant, then, is an artist.

B001HBYHFA|5|A great end to the tv series. Found I had gotten emotionally involved with the characters and didn't want it to end...
B0094BB4TW|3|DVD is ok but it's hard to set up exactly how I want it.......I don't want people that I don't like being able to see my posts.
B00000JY1X|5|As for this just being condescending, coffee house, grad school, art pop, I can only say maybe so.  But the people who like it seem to smell a lot better than those who don't.  Spell . . . I menat spell, not smell.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great book.
B006OCM0G0|5|I loved this game the second I got it you should get it and if your completely addicted then only take advantage of the sales and I you probably never buy than ever time you earn a gem and get ten spend it on getting coins.
B0099114WO|5|Meryl Streep plays the housewife that always has been willing to support her husband.  But, her children are grown and she asks is this all???
B000MNP2KI|5|So somewhat to my surprise, it turns out that, in general, I actually like James Bond films. This comes as something a shock to me, because normally I tend to prefer more highbrow cinema. But there's something about Bond...    When the Bond movies are at their best ([[ASIN:B000M53GMC Goldfinger]], [[ASIN:B000M53GMW Licence To Kill]], [[ASIN:B000LY4J3E On Her Majesty's Secret Service - 2-Disc Ultimate Edition]], [[ASIN:B000M53GNG Thunderball]]), they are among the best films ever made. Roger Ebert even put \\"Goldfinger\\" on his list of Great Films. When they're bad, however, they can really stink up the joint. [[ASIN:B000NIBURG Moonraker]] anyone? Yeah, I thought not.    Given the way the franchise had been leaning in the last few films (invisible car, anyone?), rebooting it was, perhaps, the only really course of action. Thank goodness when they rebooted it, they did a great job!    This is a VERY good film. Excellent action sequences, a tight plot, good acting and beautiful scenery (even though it wasn't filmed in Montenegro, which is a pity). The villain, while certainly unpleasant and weird, isn't nearly as unrealistic as some of the other Bond bad guys, and his plans are much more interesting than, say, world domination.    Daniel Craig makes for an excellent Bond. I would say, just on this one movie, that he is, thus far, almost as good, if not actually as good, as Connery. He's got great intensity, a good sense of timing and, well, frankly, he IS Bond.    I very much look forward to the next Bond film and in the meantime highly recommend this one.
B00DYEN5QU|5|love comic book movies and the 3d is great. just recently got a 3d tv so im making the best of it!
B00AA0TJO8|3|This was for my Granddaughter
B00FAX6XQC|5|Great game lots of funny great  graphics for a tablet game. had problems running after you get to the second region but it is still fun.
B00008S2VG|5|Once again Madonna made the world discover another underground music tendence: the electroclash. <BR>With modern, up to date beats, beatuful guitars and strings and reasonable, mature lyrics, Madonna proves why shes trhe undeniable queen of POP. <BR>The best tracks are Love Profusion, Hollywood, Easy Ride, Nobody Knows Me, Intervention... and the first single, American Life, is hilarious, funny, cool - I live to dance to it!!!
B004T4LUPW|3|I rate it as adequate but I am very disappointed that I had to get it.  I wanted to be able to view my calendar in my hotmail account.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|Great game. Love it kept me busy for hours. I love hidden object games just don't like the same items.
B0018S6YO4|4|I am happy that the CD was delivered to me without scratches and at a very timely pace. I love the songs that I had not quite heard yet.
030726999X|5|After the dismal and shockingly badly written \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire (GWPWF)\\", I really wasn't sure if I would persevere but am glad I did cos Stieg Larsson really pulls out all the stops and succeeds in redeeming himself magnificently with this thrilling and brilliantly executed concluding instalment of the Millenium Trilogy. Like its predecessor, there are still too many indistinguishably colorless characters with walk on parts that overtaxes and clutters one's memory bank unnecessarily, but all's forgiven considering the sheer enormity of the pay off.<br /><br />It's all the more remarkable that Larsson has done such a great job of keeping the reader in taut suspense and turning the pages feverishly when the heroine Lisbeth Salander spends most of the time being heavily guarded and confined to her hospital bed with only her allies outside digging desperately to unravel the secret about the enemy out to destroy her. That and the fact that the enemy's identity is implied if not explicitly named or revealed less than half way through the story.  Whereas its predecessor was absent a plot or if there was one, stalled and went nowhere, \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest(GWKHN)\\"'s success can be credited to its well thought out plotting and devilishly clever pacing. Like when a newly introduced and quite obviously heavyweight character emerges quite early in the story only to get dispatched so suddenly and in such an unexpectedly violent manner, is an example of how Larsson might go for the ice pick in the forehead effect, though there's nothing predictable about his pacing. He mixes up his shots like playing a great tennis match to deliver an experience that's simply exhilarating.<br /><br />Many readers have written about the book's terrific ending - I can only agree. Just when you think it's a wrap, you vaguely recall there's some unfinished business left and find yourself embroiled in a slugfest that should satisfy the hardest to please reader of action novels.  A fitting ending to the tortured early life of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />Hard to believe but GWKHN does live up to its hype !  A fantastic read !ting ending to the tortured early life of Lisbeth Salander.    Hard to believe but GWKHN does live up to its hype !  A fantastic read !

B00DUCXFUC|5|This is my favorite movies
B00C74HKF0|5|This was a gift for my sister who is a huge Hepburn fan and Roman Holiday is among her favorite movies.  I have to say this doll looks even better in person and she loved it!  Perfect!  Thank you Amazon.
B000KIPT30|5|I record a podcast with one other person. I connected this to my Tascam 2488 MKII digital workstation. It works fine, no glitches, pot noise or hissing. For the price, and usage, I can't ask for anything more.
B00006L7XQ|5|This was the last studio album that was released during Cash's life.  As with most prolific artists this will not be the LAST album to be released with his name on the cover.  But for me this was it.  You can almost hear the life escaping this man as he pours his heart and soul into these tracks.  As far as I know the only original track on here is the titular \\"The Man Comes Around\\"  This is a stunningly simultaneously dark and crisp narrative about \\"the man\\" an agent of God who is making the final tallies for Judgment Day.<br /><br />The other tracks are all covers.  I love the way he warbled through Bridge Over Troubled Water, it was epic in scope.  I was surprised to find \\"I Hung My Head\\" to have originally been a David Bowie song, but Cash puts his mark on it.  The rest of the tracks are not as strong as the ones above, but add to the overall mood, the feeling of finality to the work.<br /><br />That is except of course for brave, vulnerable, soulful and heart wrenching cover of the Nine Inch Nails track \\"Hurt\\".  This is one of those tracks that begs to be heard.  Crank it all the way up to 11.  This is a powerful ballad, the lyrics which Cash subtly changed to make it seem more personal.  Once you have seen the video that was created for this track you can't help but picture June looking over his shoulder as he belts out this mea culpa to her and to his fans.  When you realize that June had passed before this video was released it takes on a whole other-worldliness.<br /><br />This album is not just for country fans, I should know, I am not a country music fan. This is an album for those who enjoy music and all the emotion that it can bring.  One warning, my dad described listening to Cash on this album as \\"... it was like he had forgotten how to sing.\\"  I can completely see his point, but for me that is what strengthens it.  It is raw.  It is decidedly unpolished.  And for me it was and is spectacular.<br /><br />T
0425252868|5|The book characterizes each pilot in detail, moreso the German than the American.  I was surprized at the low esteem Goering had for his luftwaffe fighter pilots.  The comraderie on both sides flows through all the anecdotes and subplots.  i read it through in one sitting - just couldnt put it down.  I was a Navy recon pilot in vietnam, and it brought back all the joy of friendship I experienced with my squadron mates and the moments of terror we shared, as well.  I could feel and understand the deep emotions expressed by the author.
B00G3DA5VC|5|Look this movie was just really warm, and sweet, i really cared about these characters, they felt real. Fantastic performances and story. Lovely score too
B00NY2XQWK|5|I was around my little brother a lot as he grew up, and I heard plenty of the Jonas Brothers. Now after hearing this album, I can definitely say they've both grown up, and it sounds good. Definitely worth a listen!
0345803485|5|will read the trilogy for sure! This is a great story, it's like a romance but it includes so many dimensions of real life!
B007KZY1YY|5|I love the 3 books!
0767827791|5|A pungent slice of Americana with a bleak, desperate undercurrent.  Though Holden is slightly old for the role, he still turns in a credible performance. Kim Novak in her debut role is all budding sexuality disguised as wholesome innocence. Supporting players are varied and uniformly fine, including Robertson, Rosalind Russell, Arthur O'Connell and Susan Strasberg (Lee's daughter). The terrific score by George Duning only adds to the mood of repression and wistfulness.
B0035OC7PO|4|Well, Mr Bryson isn't a fan of Austria! He lambasts it in a very tongue in cheek way as his inimitable style. Still, that's why many, many people around the world love his work! At one stage I burst out laughing at his description of something or other, I wish I could remember and quote it, but there were so many! This is essential reading for anyone planning a European tour, grab it!
0439023521|5|Amazingly thought out. How she puts the life in these three books are amazing!! Recomend these books for young adults and adults above 13.
B005K0HDGE|5|Make sure you have plenty of free time to read because you won't want to put it down until the last page! And leave time to muse while you are reading.
B005LJK3AC|4|High quality comedy
B00P42WROG|5|As always Stephen King did it again
B00DPM90C4|4|This book will be a movie. Like the Bourne series without the amnesia and plus terrorists. Should definitely give it a read.
B0040I09RM|5|Great need second season on prime
B00P42WROG|4|Definitely worth reading.
B006MW3UZW|5|You don't have to be an Anglophile to fall in love with this series. The story lines and characters alike pull you into their lives and you are hooked. I streamed the whole season in only 3 nights. Huge fan and highly recommended!
B004XJRQUQ|1|Scares me to think that the plot of having children fight to the death for sport, with all the bloody details, no holds barred...can actually be this huge of a hit in our society.  mental illness, extreme vanity, with the main character who is a classic sociopath.  really crappy books. Shame on all the parents who let their children read this garbage.
B004XUMMFE|5|Loved it. Too bad it was only 1 season.
B00I46T7W4|5|nice
B00FEMJF6O|5|This game is fun. It is a long play. And has a lot of playability without s pending real money.
B005DJREGQ|5|I love watching awkward! I would totally watch the whole season over again! Recommend this to anyone who likes a comedy drama
B001VM0LAK|5|Cast and story were incredible! !!
B000RLH2VM|5|I enjoyed the quality of the sets in which this film was recorded; a classic, action-packed, theatre-feature presentation. Thank you.
B009LDD4V4|5|I have enjoyed every episode from Bones, it is a great show. I enjoy all of the different characters, they are all very different and fun. Love it!!
B000JO9JHW|5|LOVE<br /><br />JUST LOVE.<br /><br />If you like CSI or anything along those lines you will love this show. They make you look at things so diffrently. This isnt coming from the detectives minds but the killers and he is a killer you like. This is just a geat show. The writers and director make you fall in love with Dexter.
B00DW39B2K|5|The fact that it has John Travolta in it made me a little hesitant to watch this, but I'm glad I did. It has a good story and strong characters.
0783244320|4|The item was advertised to have some scratches on it but it's appearance was perfect and I enjoy each performance.
B00VFTAXUC|1|Terrible quality
B006MW3UZW|5|Enjoyed season 2 even more, what a quality program. I really love gramama, she is a amazing matriarch, smart and entertaining
B006MW3UZW|5|It continues to keep me in suspense.
B000002JEV|5|How could you go wrong? For us that grew up in the 70s and 80son Led Zeppelin, it's a must have.
B00HVJB4VM|4|When he's not writing about sports, Michael Lewis is great at making complex, confusing financial subject matter seem... well, still rather complex and confusing, but at least moderately accessible to lay people. Flash Boys pulls back the curtain on high-frequency trading. I think we all know that millionaires and corporations have a significant informational advantage on the stock market. But it's not just information - they make trades that are not even AVAILABLE to the rest of us, thanks to their superfast processing speeds. Which makes the whole public stock market that much more artificial.<br /><br />Also amazing is that the Internet made it possible to trade anywhere - yet now, to succeed, you need to physically locate your servers within or right next to Wall Street, which gives you a few precious microseconds' advantage over everyone else. Centralization is the new decentralization.
B00F8H0LM2|5|Hey, Great action moves on this version of the game so get it and try it. It's free for all.
B00BWJARHO|5|We had heard so much controversy about this film, and are huge fans of the books, so were skeptical.  But the additions are wonderful, and the visuals are spectacular!  We loved it, and watched it twice during the 48 hour rental.
B00CH87HF4|1|one star.
0061729078|5|good
B0063GORYU|5|I love playing this game...  I play in my free time and always go over my time.  I love it!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5|Without a doubt the best series I've read in a very log time! Wonderful love stoy, loved the characters! Hot hot hot
B0000C4LXG|5|For those who knows the History, Mayhem is something like anthological, impossible to understand the heavy metal without listen Mayhem
B000W8HC8I|5|Raunchy, wild, sex, drugs, money- A fun read!
B005LZW8FO|5|This is a wonderful film.  It was subtle and pulled you into the story and the tension was twisted up like a spring.  The scenes were minimalist and moving.  The fine details really sold the movie for me.  I would highly recommend this film for viewing and purchase.  I think William Mapother deserves an Academy Award for his perfomance.
B00JAC25FM|1|I couldn't get with this app.
B008Y7B3NY|4|great movie!
158270208X|5|The book is just beautiful, and the size is perfect.  Within weeks of daily writing, my life has changed 180 degrees!
B000089RVX|5|Originally I purchased this album for one song, &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;, but I was totally astonished of the quality and substance of all the other songs on this album.  I listen to the songs every day and I just can't get enough of the songs and eclectic style of the band.  <br />In my opinion this band and their debut album need more recognition, more public exposure.  There are very few albums and bands of this caliber today.<br />Awsome songs, lyrics and style.
B0000CESR7|5|Riccardo Chailly is an excellent Bruckner conductor. Why? Because he understands the internal structure of the music and knows how to keep the ideas flowing, which is no easy task in Bruckner's music.<br /><br />The interpretations are solid and Chailly is able to bring out the emotional depths of this music perhaps not heard before. The only other Bruckner conductor I can compare him to is Gunter Wand, who in my opinion, is the greatest Bruckner conductor and is certainly my favorite. Jochum doesn't make my list nor does Karajan. Chailly knows how to build the climax and sustain emotional interest throughout this set. The Berlin Radio Symphony and Royal Concertgebouw play with guts, fire, and passion. They have what takes to bring Bruckner's ever-expansive musical vision to fruition. The audio quality of this set is also superb, which makes this cycle even more attractive.<br /><br />Anyone who likes Bruckner's music shouldn't be without Chailly's set. Outstanding playing from start to finish.
B009ZQ8FQG|4|Downton Abbey is a wonderful show. If you are a first timer to the show you should start from Season 1. This season has a lot of things happen but the end of the 3rd season is very dissapointing. I haven't decided if I will watch Season 4.
B00969GFFU|4|I thought this was a good read. I liked it. I am writing this review to rate the product. I much prefer Freedom to The Corrections, which I didn't really like.
B00I6IKSZ0|2|B4 this update with potions and anti gravity, THIS GAME WAS THE BEST!! now its just a piece of crap
B0009R1T7M|5|It's extremely difficult to describe the music on Sufjan Stevens' ILLINOIS.  It's unlike anything I've ever heard in my entire life.  Upon first hearing it I felt like Saleri listening to Mozart's compositions for the first time. Though the music will not appeal to everyone, it's so unique and refreshing I suggest that anyone who enjoys real music listen to ILLINOIS a few times just for the experience.  Some of my favorite songs from the album include:<br /><br />\\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\\"--the song that comes closest to being a theme song for the State of Illinois on the album.  The song is very upbeat, alluding the hope in the future and the promise of progress of the World's Columbian Exposition that was held in Chicago in 1893.  The song also has an allusion to a downstater, author and historian Carl Sandburg.<br /><br />\\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\"--this moving and emotionally ballad refers to the famous serial killer from Illinois.  The song basically tells the tragic biography of Gacy.  Gacy was a well-respected, nice man that everyone who met seemed to like, but he abused and killed many young boys.  The song uses Gacy as a metaphor for the evil actions that all of us commit in our thoughts and hearts.<br /><br />\\"Jacksonville\\"--a country-feeling, yet upbeat song about the middle-state city that was named for Andrew Jackson and was a major stopping point of the underground railroad.<br /><br />\\"Chicago\\"--having grown up in southern Illinois, I have mixed feelings for Chicago, the city that literally means \\"stinking weed\\".  However, even though the city is mentioned and referred to several times in other songs on the album, I guess it's only fitting that the album contains at least one tune just for Chicago.  The first time I heard the song I didn't like it very much, but the more I listened to it, the more I came to like it.  In that regard, Stevens' \\"Chicago\\" is just like the city it is named after.<br /><br />\\"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\"--just looking to the title one would think that this song is about Metropolis, IL and the giant Superman statue in the town.  But it's much more.  The song has a driving percussion beat and guitar medley in the chorus emphasizing the positive feelings that Superman conveys.  Superman was one of the first Christ-like characters to appear in comics and the song uses that imagery, meditating on the real man of steel.<br /><br />\\"The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!\\"--of all the songs on the album, this song is the one most obviously spiritual and is full of religious imagery.  The song is a hymn about the beauty of creation and the Creator who made it all. `Lamb of God, we sound the horn/Hallelujah!/To us your ghost is born. Hallelu'<br /><br />\\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From the Dead!!  Run for Your Lives!! AHHHHH!\\"--the music of this song is very rhythmic, direct, and repetitive (especially the spelling chant of I-L-L-I-N-O-I-S) and makes the song feel like an army of marching zombies attacking.  The song mentions many of the great people who were born, raised, and that lived in Illinois from Ulysses Grant to Ronald Reagan.  It also mentions several towns and cities in Illinois.  In general, the song seems to be a call to arms to not forget the people and places (most from common origins) that made the state great; the remembrance of those people and places should inspire the citizens to rise and make the state great again.<br /><br />Overall, a unique album of music full of vivid images, spiritual allusions, and powerful metaphors.  The music is original and smart.  Highly recommended, especially for people looking for a fresh and different sound.this song is about Metropolis, IL and the giant Superman statue in the town.

B007ZGO7EM|5|super easy to use and convient!!!! I would recommend this to anyone that needs a calculator! great for kids too!
B00FEMJF6O|3|Cool game.  Fun to do but a little boring to.  C colors and graphics are colorfully and my kid likes to play it
B009CPJHY4|2|I like the stars, but I didn't like the movie. It was disjointed, didn't flow well. I didn't finish it.
0486275590|4|My daughter needs this book for the up coming school year. It is in great shape and arrive very quick.
014241543X|1|I really wanted to love this book but please please pleeease do not waste your time and money on this book. I fell into the trap of wanting to read this book because of the movie trailer but the book is nothing more than what you see in the preview. This book is written as if it is geared towards a pre-teen audience but the language and graphic imagery (lots of f-bombs) just lead me to assume it was a total miss for adult readers and preteens alike. Total disappointment. I found myself 20, 50, 100 pages in just HOPING it would get better but nope never did...
B00IIUATDM|5|Cool
B005ZOBNOI|4|Thoroughly readable. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The characters are captivating. The ending was not as good as the rest of the book.
B000BI0WOA|1|For a longtime fan of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler this collection was very poor.  Tracks varied greatly in recording quality. Often vocal tracks were almost nonexistent.
0790749815|5|This is a great chase movie! Cary Grant and Eva Marrie Saint sizzle on the screen! You must own this movie!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun to play
B00HCH5TA0|5|Love it
B0044C5SCU|5|Great season, love the actors and the writting.  Great show looking forward to watching season 4 and season 5 soon.
B00R5DXFS4|5|I LOVE MOST OF THE SONGS THAT ARE IN THIS CD, THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT DOESN췂T MAKE ME HAPPY, BUT IT HAS ALL THE SONGS YOU  HEAR DURING THE MOVIE.
B00GFRA9AS|1|Cannot give honest feedback as I was unable to take advantage of the free app download. Maybe I'll try again when it's free.
B00AE6SS5O|5|Great game.  Enjoyed this well done experience.  Hope to see more of this developers games soon.  Bought as free app of the day.
141694737X|4|We like this book. My son likes the repetition of it and likes saying the animal sounds. However, the flaps aren't all that sturdy. He had bent one the very first time that we read it and within a few readings, had actually torn it loose. I'm going to glue it and see if that holds it for awhile.
0920668372|5|My favorite
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great way to pass time when you have a few minutes to kill. Graphics are great, not wooziness-inducing like some of the other games like this.
B001I82RVS|3|i found my self laughing at some parts of it but not bad could had been worse
B000687M48|2|Pretty bad.  If they had edited it better it would be ok, but the constant jumping from one view to the next is nauseating.  This one went straight to eBay after trying to watch it once.
B000HCO83Q|2|A huge fan of both the comics and the cartoon series, I loved the first X-Men, particularly the way Singer created an ensemble team, combined the mutants' talents, and made them explode on screen (sans funny spandex costumes). The second was also enjoyable, although the original remains my favorite. The third was an absolute mess. A feast for the eyes, certainly, in terms of special effects and action, but it had little appreciation for the characters. <br /> <br />Unlike the first two films, there is a lack of focus on our mutants. They are merely warriors within an army, without character or cause. There are too many of them - the audience gets lost in a visual series of \\"powers,\\" and it seems Ratner was merely using the premise of the X-Men and mutants purely to display some sort of special effects mastery. You really only see glimpses when you hope to see the whole picture. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the explanation of the Phoenix, as both the comics and cartoon were often unclear about the hows and whys. And Famke Jenssen does a masterful job with all her silent gazes and glares. But Xaviar is cast off too quickly and without purpose. What little script that exists is canned and even corny. And the film disregards too many of our feature mutants. Rogue - one of my favorites from the comics - is incredibly powerful, but she is nonexistent in the film. She serves almost no purpose, which is a complete waste. Mystique is also wasted. She was so awesome in X2, I would have hoped to see a repeat performance. <br /> <br />In a nutshell: sorry premise, misuse of mutants, too many mutants to identify with any of the characters, and hardly more than a special effects fun fair.  <br /> <br />I would LOVE to see another X-Men ensemble, but only if it returns to its roots as envisioned by Bryan Singer.
B00DU73T08|1|very boring movie I fell sleep three quarters of the wayI believe this is a movie for childrendefinitely not what I expected
B00DUGCLY4|4|Some easy some hard. Young and old can do this in spare time. Need more start up coins though. Enough said
B001EO748M|4|Great drama.
B008TMA1LY|1|This game has in-app purchasing, and *DOES NOT* tell you how much the item you're purchasing costs in real money. This, to me, shows questionable business practices on the part of the app developer.<br /><br />My daughter loves to play this game, and this morning I found a receipt in my inbox for $9.99 for 1250 Hello Kitty points. When I checked within the app, I found that nowhere does it say how much buying points costs. Caveat emptor, everyone. Buyer beware.
B00MUCX6AW|2|The movie title is not kidding when it said repeat. It was ok. Surprised Tom cruise did a sci-fi movie
B0000033P0|4|Tarkus(1971). Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Second Album.<br /><br /> After the Top 5 success of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Eponymous debut, they hit the studios to create their most daring work, 'Tarkus'. The entire first half of 'Tarkus' is made up of the 21 Minute Title Track, a Progressive Rock masterpiece that still stands as one of the Top 10 of all-time, and for good reason. 'Tarkus' features the immense vocal and guitar talents of Greg Lake, the illustrous drumming of Carl Palmer, and the massive keyboard/synthesizer talents of Keith Emerson, so Emerson, Lake, and Palmer was set to rock the world. Upon its release, 'Tarkus' debuted at #1 in the U.K., and rose to the Top 5 in the US, going Multi-Platinum even without a hit single. So, is 'Tarkus' an overblown album only worth the title track, or an overall excellent album? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Tarkus- \\"Tarkus\\" is a sprawling, epic, progressive masterpiece, and I will be rating it by its subdivsions.<br /><br /> A) Eruption- \\"Eruption\\" is a Psychadelic Rocker in which Keith Emerson flexes his Keyboarding and Synthesizer talents. Think of a Doors Instrumental!<br /><br /> B)Stones Of Years- \\"Stones Of Years\\" seamlessly flows Lake's phenomenal vocals into the equation, while keeping the backup keyboards. Emerson once again shows us his talents on an organ, yet this is more jazzy than psychadelic.<br /><br /> C) Iconclast- \\"Iconclast\\" starts off almost frantically, with fever-pitch drumming from Palmer, and Emerson casually blends Organs, Keyboards, and Synthesizers.<br /><br /> D)Mass- \\"Mass\\" FINALLY adds in Lake's guitar along with his soaring vocals, but Emerson quickly takes over with a phenomenal organ solo, greatly helped by frequent e;ectric bursts from Lake's guitar and INSANE drumming from Palmer. This section also fleshes out the story more, with Lake's vocals putting out excellent lyrics.<br /><br /> E) Manticore- \\"Manticore\\" starts off mostly as a drum solo, with slight touches of Emerson's synthesizer, and it continues on to become an almost Psychadelic Drum Solo with slight organ interplay.<br /><br /> F) Battlefield- \\"Battlefield\\" echoes to The Doors, as Lake's foreboding vocals are frequently interspersed between Emerson's organ and keyboard solos, and Lake actually plays a large amount of guitar, as Emerson takes a seat for Lake. Excellent example of Classic Rock!<br /><br /> G)Aquatarkus- \\"Aquatarkus\\" shows that the good guys prevailed against tarkus, so Emerson's Synthesizer solo almost sounds like a victory song, and the listener feels like throwing their fist into the air! \\"Tarkus\\" ends with a more Pink Floyd feel, with odd sounds like gongs, and interplay between Emerson's synthesizer and organ. \\"Tarkus\\" is a Progressive Masterpiece, and quite frankly, is worth the price of the album alone. 5 stars easily!<br /><br /> Jeremy Bender- \\"Jeremy Bender\\" finds Keith Emerson using a piano technique not unlike the Old West pianists in bars, and Lake's happy, upbeat vocals make this short song a fun, almost Old Western rocker!<br /><br /> Bitches Crystal- \\"Bitches Crystal\\" is almost undescribeable, but it finds Lake belting out funny lyrics behind Emerson's unrelenting keyboard, along with frequent dark(as in, not happy) outbursts from the synthesizer. An odd, fun rocker.<br /><br /> The Only Way(Hymn)- \\"The Only Way(Hymn)\\" starts off like a church song, with Emerson's organ playing, but suddenly it gets very dark, and Lake's symphonic, yet oddly remorseful vocals and lyrics come in. Soon the song goes in a new direction, with Emerson breaking loose on the keyboard, and Lake singing happy, light vocals to end this Keyboarding Ballad.<br /><br /> Infinite Place(Conclusion)- \\"Infinite Place(Conclusion)\\" starts off like usual, with Emerson breaking into a keyboard solo, starting off slow but picking up the pace to a frenzy before settling down again to mold an all-keyboard Jazzy Instrumental.<br /><br /> A Time And A Place- \\"ATime And A Place\\" starts off loudly, with Emerson's deep, almost bassy keyboard notes backing up Lake's screaming, almost pleading vocals. A very moody, and heavy, melodic keyboard Rocker!<br /><br /> Are You Ready Eddy?- \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" shows ELP throwing away all their Progressive elements and sitting back and belting out some 50's Rock, very much like Buddy Holly. \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" is a fun rocker, that in all my dreams, I'd never expect Emerson, Lake, and Palmer to do!<br /><br /> Overall, 'Tarkus' is a step up from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's debut, but I still think they have a ways to go. As many reviewers have mentioned, after the magnificent 'Tarkus', the other songs seem a little bit mediocre in comparison, and although they aren't bad tracks, they're unfortuneatly right. Also, I'm happy Greg Lake got more time for singing, yet his guitar talents should be fleshed out more than 1 or 2 solos on \\"Tarkus\\". On the Good Side, Keith Emerson sounds better than on the debut, as he's introduced Organs and Synthesizers to the mix, while still keeping the familar keyboard.<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PROGRESSIVE ROCK, EMERSON, LAKE, AND PALMER, CLASSIC ROCK, AND FANS OF CLASSICAL PIANO. \\"TARKUS\\" IS WORTH THE PURCHASE ALONE, TRUST ME!<br /><br /> Killer Kuts- \\"Tarkus\\"<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Brain Salad Surgery- Emerson, Lake, and Palmer<br /><br /> In The Court of King Crimson- King Crimson<br /><br /> The Doors- The Doors<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!e usual, with Emerson breaking into a keyboard solo, starting off slow but picking up the pace to a frenzy before settling down again to mold an all-keyboard Jazzy Instrumental. <br /><br />  <br /><br /> A Time And A Place- \\"A Time And A Place\\" starts off loudly, with Emerson's deep, almost bassy keyboard notes backing up Lake's screaming, almost pleading vocals.

On the Good Side, Keith Emerson sounds better than on the debut, as he's introduced Organs and Synthesizers to the mix, while still keeping the familar keyboard.  <br /><br />  <br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PROGRESSIVE ROCK, EMERSON, LAKE, AND PALMER, CLASSIC ROCK, AND FANS OF CLASSICAL PIANO. \\"TARKUS\\" IS WORTH THE PURCHASE ALONE, TRUST ME! <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Killer Kuts- \\"Tarkus\\" <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Also Recommended- <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Brain Salad Surgery- Emerson, Lake, and Palmer <br /><br /> In The Court of King Crimson- King Crimson <br /><br /> The Doors- The Doors <br /><br />  <br /><br /> Thanks For Reading! <br /><br />
B000O8OTNC|5|Great tool the plastic outside isn't the strongest but it still makes a handy sharpener.
B00BD6EJRK|5|Good
B00FAPF5U0|5|i love this game i play it all the time it is one of the best i have on my phone.
B0091REZMW|5|I have been playing for a few days now and am enjoying it. I haven't paid anything, I just play till I run out of energy then let it recharge.
B00HHJPUFM|5|Everyone, I think, would enjoy this.  We are senior citizens so it's not just for children. We love the little characters and we love the &#34;plot&#34; ~ someone has a good imagination.
B00M25EALG|4|Let's face it, it isn't going to win any major &#34;awards&#34;, but it's a very fun movie, with both action and suspense, and a nice take on &#34;what if&#34;!
B007UXT6T6|5|I don't care how much you disagree with his personal life, Tom Cruise is an excellent actor. He brings an intensity to every role that draws you at black hole force. Ghost Protocol was well written and directed. Paula Patton proved she was capable of playing more than just a pretty face. Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg put it down for the team, also. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000I8ERVM|4|A superb cast leads this well crafted tale of suspense and real life demonic possession into familiar, yet very well crafted arenas.  Part court room drama, part mystery, part intelligent horror, if you long for suspense and scares that are grounded in quality storycraft, very strong lead performances, and a blood-runs-cold, real events plot, then this is for you.
B00HTYU2XK|5|Excellent show !!
B00HGJ18C2|5|This is a game that is fun to play and very relaxing in nature. it takes concentration along with a bit of strategy playing to win the game, also is a stress reliever in that you can't play this game when your stressed out.

B000002L82|5|This was my first New Order album, I got it for Your Silent Face, which was at the time the only New Order song I knew. Power, Corruption & Lies is CLASSIC, a MUST if you're a big fan of the band. The first half appealed much more to me than the second half of the disc, but either way it all fit together very well.   BTW I have the 1990 CD version, the one that isn't \\"loaded with errors\\" and has Blue Monday & The Beach tacked on to the end of each side. Personally I don't mind that they threw the 2 tracks in there, they make the album even better! Age of Consent is as I already said, CLASSIC New Order, The Village is a light & happy song, and 586 is my personal favorite, may I even argue that it's New Order's best song ever. I listen to this in my car over, and over, and over again, it can't stop getting me pumped up.
B00G0OHMUG|5|Great movie and looks awesome in 3D. Clear and great sound quality. I got the two disc set in blu-ray. Great extra features on the regular blu-ray disc.
B008FRFN7A|4|I needed help to get it hooked up so I could do pictures from my kindle.  The pictures are wet when they come out of the copier. I would recommend it to someone who is more into copier than I. As I go hopefully I will understand it better.
B0002IVN9W|5|This is a truly remarkable ALBUM, and I capatalize that word because that's what makes this release so important.  These days, a lot of people just collect singles by downloading.  The album seems to be dying, replaced by releases with a few standout tracks and enough filler to get to LP length.<br /><br />But the Arcade Fire chose to go a different route.  It's not the most original release, but they did an excellent job of taking inspiration from older artists and following in their footsteps.  The tracks on this album fit together like puzzle pieces, and when you get to the end you feel like you've completed a jouney.  Sure, the singles are great, but each one has even more power when played within the context of the album.<br /><br />So the question you might ask is \\"Will I like this album?\\"  If you're a fan of indie pop, I think you'll love this album.  If you're a fan of artists like David Bowie and Brian Eno who combined art rock with dance beats, then you'll love this album.  If you can appreciate a group of talented, theatrical artists who seem to be having a great time, and you like a dark side to your music, you'll absolutely love this album.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of impact the Arcade Fire will have on rock.  Maybe they're not original enough and will be forgotten in five year, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great album now.
B00493E1GI|4|Loved the movie, loved the book.  I wish I was able to drop everything and be Julia Roberts in the movie for a while.
B00005QIPH|5|this group is amazing.Expecially julian who is the vocal of the group.the Last nite song is the best.THE STROKES IS THE BEST!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5|This game is awesome. It is so much fun. No problems with the download. It gets addictive so easily. If you are looking for good old fashion fun, this is it.
B005H9B44A|3|The plot is good and plausible, good entertainment. Much of the movie is very dark and images are not clear. There appears to be &#34;pixel smudging&#34; and though action is happening via sound, the movements cannot actually be seen. The story can be followed by sound and by speech, but not by visual effects. The stills are striking and beautiful, but the action cannot be deciphered visually.
B007BFSYMS|5|This does a great job of creating ambient noise, which can be really relaxing and helps me relax or even fall asleep. There are over 40 noises, including ocean sounds, running water, and rain (if you can't tell, I like water noises). There is also wind, a clothes dryer, airplane, and tons more. I'm surprised at the selection, first of all, but I'm blown away by how realistic all the noises sound. It is a great way to get some relaxing background noise.
B005S9EJ46|5|The movie is excellent.  Shows a humorous side of getting older, relationships that grow and change, and an oustanding cast of actors. Very well done!
B00FMQILBC|4|My daughter loved this is what all that matters but I wasn't too keen on the size. Maybe if we would have painted the wall it would look better in my opinion. But this should make your little one happy!
0385474547|4|The book uses oral history and parables to illustrate the many facets of humanity.  I think too many readers focus in on the literal and don't understand that the author is really giving us a story of life in all its  wonderful, silly, humane and tragic episodes.
B00DVKOYBM|1|The rules of this game are about stupid and a half. Slop left and right, laggy... this game is 90% luck so if you suck at pool, this is the game for you.
B004SBS8LA|5|This game keeps my grandboys occupied for hours, and thats a good thing especially if you are busy cooking or cleaning or even getting your nails done, just get this angry birds and you will have peace while it occupies them
B00005NWM3|5|Nickleback's silver side up , in my opinion, is one of the years best rock albums. Many people would argue and say they are to weak or to wussy but the riffs and lyrics on his album are awsome!The songs are so catchy and I listen to it everyday. GO AND BUY THIS CD!
B004QZ9PLU|4|Dawson Cole is a loveable enough character.  He is from the wrong side of the tracks and has every chance to turn out like the rest of his family, but in spite of it all he gets out of Oriental, a small southern town, and becomes a derrick hand on an oil rig.  We see flashbacks to when he first met Amanda Collier in high school, their early romance over the summer of their junior year, and how they became very close during their senior year, in 1984. SO that she can have her dreams he breaks things off, but never really lets go of her memory.  When Tuck Hostetler, their common connection to the town, dies (you know someone has to die... it is a N. Sparks novel) they are both summoned back to town by the estate lawyer.  The book centers around them spending the weekend reminising about their school days crush and the memorial for Tuck.  There is plenty of intrigue from Dawson's kin and the story of Tuck's life as it is revealed.  But I have to admit the story was good but I did not care for the premise of a single man and a married woman.  I have read all of N. Sparks' books with the exception of the vacation blog with his brother and this one if one of his better stories.  I just wish I was not cringing over her being married through most of the book.<br /><br />Also note: there is a typo on my book .. page 101, line three, the word \\"they\\" is left out.  Yep I am OCD and I just had to throw that in (but please do not check my spelling as I can not spell to save my life)  :)
B00AW57L96|4|The story unfolds, and yes, I was surprised at the &#34;secret&#34;, but from that point I was a bit frustrated.  To tell or not to tell??  Still, a good read.
B003K1EYM6|3|Well packaged but didn't work with my iPad 2 and Samsung DV150Fcamera. Error message &#34;Too much power needed&#34; or something like that. I had read warnings on Amazon prior to purchasing but hadn't updated the iOS so was hoping it would work out. I was traveling, so didn't have a laptop to use as usual to back up my photos. Ended up just downloading the Samsung SMART CAMERA App to connect with my camera via wifi, which works like a charm to transfer files between devices.
B00IMYZOBQ|5|What a film! Action-packed, tense and suspenseful right to the very end.<br /><br />Also, an experience of what Space is like: the total absence of everything (air, heat, water and, yes, gravity) humans need to live. We've all heard the idea that we live on a small unique planet; Gravity reminds us how truly precious that is.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I really like this app and the pictures used for seek + find are beautiful, however you are given limited energy and when that energy runs out, you have to either wait 15-20 minutes for it to restore or you have to buy more energy with crystals. Eventually the crystals run out and then your only option is to wait, which is obviously frustrating.
B00003CXN4|1|This movie was by far one of the WORST movies I've ever seen!!  However if you can watch 5 movies at one time and keep up with each movie all at the same time then I suppose you'll like this movie.  If you're like me and only care to watch one movie at a time then this movie is NOT for you!  I found this movie confusing, boring, and horrible!  I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone.  All of my friends agree that it was horrible and can not figure out what all of these people who say that it's going to be a classic are talking about!
B00005YXZH|5|YHF is the best album to come out since SummerTeeth and possibly their best.  Musically and lyrically Tweedy and Co. are leaps and bounds above any other band I've heard since I don't know when and YHF just continues to prove it.
B007N85POS|5|This game I will never get tired of this is my relax no stress take me away for awhile mojo game thank you very much
B000AJIF4E|5|Great product.  Couldn't be happier.
B00KNWYDU8|5|Awesome<br /><br />The game plays well and stuff isn't to expensive
B00FKF0F3C|1|I have read most of Ken Follett's books and have never been as disappointed as I was with this one.  The previous 2 books to this trilogy were fabulous and demonstrated what appeared to be an unbiased look at the numerous flaws within society as seen through the eyes of various characters with differing thoughts and ideals.  While reading this book, however, I felt the author was trying to push his political views onto the reader rather than allow for an actual story to take place that presented likable characters.  I read for both enjoyment, but also to broaden my perspective on the world in general.  I chose to embark on this series because I liked the basis of viewing major world events through the eyes of characters from varying walks of life and cultures.  How disappointing that Mr. Follett couldn't keep his disgust with American culture under control and present an objective piece.  While there are definitely periods of time within American history that are nothing to be proud of, I did not appreciate the slanted view on how anyone with a more conservative point of view was a sadistic monster.  Just ridiculous!  Unfortunately, this will be the last Ken Follett book I purchase.  I am open to different points of view and appreciate them, but the presentation in this book was simply to shove liberal ideals down everyone's throat, while simultaneously trying to shame people for not agreeing.  As a military veteran I found the comparison of Evie Williams story to that of Jane Fonda, and the author's defense of her actions particularly disgusting.  Not to mention the writing of this book was poor in comparison with the first 2 of the trilogy.  You could tell the author was simply on a rant.  He threw in a lot of sex to try and spike interest, but it just made the book even more ridiculous.  My recommendation is to stay away from this one.  Even if you agree with everything Mr. Follett presents it is such substandard writing it was almost painful for me to finish.
B003405MF6|5|Although compared to \\"You Had it Coming\\", this would be considered \\"laid back\\". However it's nice to hear another side of Jeff Beck. And, for several years Jeff has expressed a desire to do an album with a symphonic orchestra. What's wrong with that?! Absolutely nothing! Though I'm sure there will be those that will whine, and wonder if Jeff's gone \\"soft\\". Not a chance in hell!! Don't be surprised if the next one is even more outrageous than \\"Y.H.I.C\\"!    But there's still some fairly aggressive stuff on here. \\"Hammerhead\\" is one of those rare pieces of music that I liked instantly! It also has a type of beat and feel that I haven't heard in a very long time. \\"There's no Other Me\\" is another heavy-handed Jeff beast, with Joss Stone singing to the absolute hilt! But, probably most of the album is the more \\"beautiful\\" side of Jeff's playing, and the combination of guitar accompanied by beautiful strings. \\"Over the Rainbow\\" has the same affect it had on me as a kid when I saw Judy sing it in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". It's difficult not to get a little \\"choked up\\" once again! Aside from the beautiful playing on this piece, Jeff gets even more complex with the way he maneuvers one note around than during the most difficult passage in \\"Where Were You!\\" Not only that, but there's a gorgeous key change, as well.     Another tune \\"Serene\\", reminds me of something Joe Zawinul would have written, once the main guitar/keyboard harmony part comes in. A sort of joyous, worldbeat, \\"Weather Report\\" kind of vibe, with strings. If you like the jazz singer Melody Gardot, you may be pleased to notice a striking similarity between her and Imelda May who sings on \\"Nessun Dorma\\". Speaking of which, about the only thing I don't like on this album is the \\"over-the-top\\" motion picture theme-type crescendo at the very ending of this tune. And, when Jeff tears into what sounds like it's going to be the killer agresso-rock solo of the album (at the end of \\"There's No Other Me\\"), there is a bizarre sudden fadeout! Too bad!    Nevertheless, we have the \\"poetic\\" side of Jeff on most of this beautifully produced album. And if you can't be open enough to let him show another side to his music, then that's your loss!
B000002KAT|2|Astral Weeks has been praised to the sky by rock critics and fans alike. It made the ten best in Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. As a person who is not a big fan of Morrison, but who has tried to be, I bought it with high expectations. I was very disappointed. Astral Weeks is in desperate need of editing and polishing. It's like a freshman essay with some good ideas, but which needs drastic cutting and reworking. In short, Morrison needs an editor. I think a casual fan of his, as I am, need only buy the \\"Best of\\" collection. Astral Weeks is like a Joyce novel that has kissed the Blarney Stone too long. As with Joyce, Morrison tests your patience. Too often, he repeats, in a stream of consciousness vein, the same lyrics over and over, such as \\"you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out,\\" etc. I do not mind repetition in a song, per se. I don't mind when George Harrison sings \\"please don't be long\\" 27 times on \\"Blue Jay Way\\" because \\"Blue Jay Way\\" has interesting, trippy music. There are some interesting musical ideas on Astral Weeks, but it perhaps has enough music for a 35 minute album, not its 50 minutes running time. Morrison should have had the discipline to have trimmed down these songs. And his voice was not really made for the quiet, acoustic, flute-filled arrangements that make up the bulk of this CD. He works much better when accompanied by horns and a good, driving rhythm section. But, you don't get a \\"Domino\\" or \\"Moondance\\" here.
096798467X|5|Excellent product, excellent service, be more than happy to recommend this product to anyone who desired it or one like it.
B001992NUQ|5|Fight Club is pretty much one of those movies that is a must have for anyone who loves movies.  Seeing any movie continue its life on Blu Ray (and then whatever will come next) is awesome and Fight Club came in style.  The bonus features on this disc are simply fantastic and provide both casual and hardcore fans of the movie a chance to see behind the curtain and all the work going into this masterpiece.  The movie itself is in stunning HD quality.  The fight scenes are twice as brutal in HD.  I recommend this to anyone who loves this movie and hasn't yet made the leap to Blu Ray.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Christian Gray meets Cross it keeps you guessing and yelling at Hudson more then once . Its a love story that has more then enough up's and down's . If you love Cross and Gray this is the next best thing .
B001GA1RFA|4|Another great book by this author. Similar light, easy-reading style. Perfect for a vacation escape. Be sure to get more than a few of the books by this author as they read very quickly.
B00NY4UIKG|5|One of Denzel's best movies in my opinion!!
B00FCQQ1IW|5|The only problem with Jeffrey Archer is that he doesn't write fast enough.  I enjoy all his books and it is hard to wait for the next one.  He does a great job keeping you guessing and just when you think you are on to something...bam..you need to shift gears and rethink.
B003JTHXOK|5|I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars. I'm going to see the movie when it comes out next week. I was disappointed in  the movie \\"The Lucky One\\" and am hopeful the movie makers Don't mess this one up. This is the best book I've read in a long while! Absolutely loved it!

B0001ARCFA|5|nice headphones with a kinda steam punk look.  comfortable over ears.
B009XIXVU6|1|Not up to the standard of his previous books. No coherent plot, random characters, not sure what he was trying to say. Just a disappointment.
B000I9VZJ8|4|My 16 yr old thinks that this is the funniest movie ever!
B00HYTSTNU|5|Excellent. Tom hanks was superb. Felt like is was experiencing the same situation. Incredible suspense.  Would recommend to anyone who is or is not a Tom Hanks fan because of the history the subject matter deals with.
B0014QABX0|5|This album is so bluesy it's unreal.  The Black Keys are the saviors of blues and garage rock!

1594481717|5|A Whole New Mind By Dan Pink (Riverhead Books, 2006). Reviewed by Steve Gladis,Ph.D.<br /><br />Just as Picasso was in his \\"blue period,\\" I think I'm in my \\"pink period\\"...Dan Pink that is. I just read A Whole New Mind, which I should have read years before, and which I think describes me better than my mother would have. In fact, I think Pink and I may have come from the same mother ;). Cherished for years and oft repeated in whole or part: \\"The truth is, a great mind must be androgynous\\" (Samuel Taylor Coleridge). In this book, Pink helped me understand once and for all why as a poet masquerading as an FBI agent, I always felt \\"weird.\\"  A right-brainer living in a world of alpha left-brainers. Perhaps that's why Dan (a lawyer by education) ended up as a speechwriter for Al Gore, and I ended up writing speeches for several directors of the FBI. Could we have been twins separated at birth?<br /><br />He argues convincingly that we're moving from an Information Age to a Conceptual (creative/inventive) Age, because of:  Abundance (we're living at the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs), Asia (left-brained work is outsourced there because it's been commoditized, and thus cheaper), and Automation (things that are solved by a strict set of rules--heuristics--are better crunched by microchips).  He argues that in the coming age those with more inventive minds will be more valued. And he argues these points well--remember Dan's a lawyer--at least, a recovering one.<br /><br />In the rest of the book, Dan describes what he calls the \\"Six Senses .\\" 1) Design--making things not only functional but engaging by design; 2) Story--developing a compelling narrative from the data; 3) Symphony--seeing the big picture and gathering  seemingly desperate parts into a harmonious whole; 4) Empathy--fostering caring relationships with our family, friends and colleagues at work; 5) Play--the need to have fun at whatever you do; 6) Meaning--seeking purpose and the greater good seems to define us uniquely as humans.<br /><br />I'll be reviewing Dan's book in some depth on my blog: [...]. I highly recommend you buy a copy and underline the hell out of it as I did. There's a ton of useful, important information that I won't have the space to mention. Thanks to Dan for writing this classic.s.       I'll be reviewing Dan's book in some depth on my blog: [...]. I highly recommend you buy a copy and underline the hell out of it as I did.

B0000BWVCM|5|What a dramatic improvement from the last X-Men movie. This film had a great plot. And while it was much closer to the original comic themed stories, it was still a movie adaptation. I'm not sure why producers, writers, directors, or whoever is responsible feel the need to try and rush several years worth of writing genius into 2 films ..... but they try to anyway.<br />The addition of Nightcrawler was beautifully done. More exploration into Wolverine's character and a slight hint to the arrival of the Pheonix in the near future were tastefully implemented as well. Add in little glimpses of several other characters that are yet to be unveiled, and this was an overall entertaining movie.<br />The second disk is full of histories &amp; backgrounds for the original X-Men comic line and several deleted scenes. Some of which were a waste and some that really could have been left in the film, given there was time available.<br />Overall the DVD is well worth buying and I highly reccomend it to any fan of the original X-Men.
B00GCE3TCE|5|It wasn't until I finished the book that I realized it was intended for young adults.  The picture the story paints tells of the struggles the German people faced during Hitler's Third Reich.  The ordinary citizen felt the same fear as all people felt at the time.  And the poverty imposed on the country so that Hitler could support his war machine, his annihilation of the Jews and to enrich the already fat pockets of his friends and colleagues is starkly revealed in its pages.  For all those who believe that the German people did not suffer under this oppressive regime, this book should be an eye-opener.<br /><br />I would also recommend the enhanced version of the book.  The scenes from the film are beautiful and poignant. I Turkey hope the film garners the Academy Awards it deserves.

B00KFNXUY0|2|Unless you link to Faceback and ask friends for help you cannot proceed in the game without paying.  I really wish the description would have stated this clearly.  I understand that is states in-app purchases but I assumed it meant for power-ups not for actual play.  Disappointed.

B002EDH0FE|4|I love this movie, but i have shown it to a few friends and they just couldnt follow the story line. And they didnt think it was a good as i did. I find this movie pretty awesome due to the time period that it takes place. as well as a few other details. i think its worth the watch. ba da bum..
B00319ECGU|5|Clint Eastwood became an icon with the Dirty Harry Movies.  The stories are relevant and touch on social and political issues that ring true, even after so many years.  The video and audio transfer for the Blu=Ray version is superb.  I cannot recommend this Blu-ray set enough.

B004LROUW2|5|I loved this book. Murakami is an amazing writer and all his ability is wonderfully displayed in this book. The story is extremely well crafted and the characters' descriptions make them jump right out of the page. They are so real and yet the story is so out of the ordinary. To me, Murakami is the intersection where Paul Auster meets Garcia Marquez. I've had the opportunity of reading really amazing books this year and I can say without doubt this one has been my favorite. For some reason I had postponed reading this book, I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it that much...Boy was I wrong....
B008RA3X5E|5|Can't say anything that others having said already....<br /><br />IT ROCKS!!!!<br /><br />Does everything it said it would..<br /><br />Thanks for this app!!!!

0393312836|5|When i first started reading the book, the slang was intimidating and i thought i wasn't going to be able to understand it, but i got through that, and now i even use some of it. Anyway, i loved this book, and i loved the  movie as well. I finished this book about 5 days ago and i just can't stop  thinking about it. Once you get into this book, you won't want to put it  down. Trust me.

B00DUGCLY4|4|FUN BUT really annoying when you run out of coins and you can't figure one out! Very easy though. There are only a few that are challenging.
B0000AQS0F|5|This is such a great series that I bought it as a gift for others. There is only one problem with this series, THAT'S IT! NO MORE seasons after you're done. There is, however the movie \\"Serenity\\". I recommend buying that as well so that you won't have that let down feeling when you're through with the series.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Amazing tv it should make the networks ashamed of themselves!
B00006AW2L|4|Beggar's and Aftermath, the U.S version are my two favorite.  I have been waiting 15 years for these remasters.  Everything sounds great, except for Paint it Black.  Jagger's vocal sounds as if he's far away.  I'd like to hear some of your comment if it sounds different than the original.    **************  Update.  The reason that Paint it Black sounds different than the previous version (Abako)US from 1985 cd is because the version on this CD is in Stereo.  In fact, all the songs on this cd are in stereo.  The original 1985 cd was in mono.  I like stereo, but these earlier stones songs sound much better in mono.  In the end, this cd isn't an improvement over the old version.   I still prefer the US edition to the UK.
B000ZELISO|5|The Half-Blood Prince is so far my favorite Harry Potter movie which I was surprised by because besides the ending there is not much progression in the overall story.  This movie sets out to set up for the 7th films and build up the relationships and it succeeds at both.  The most important part of the film is that it is well made, the acting is spectacular, the effects are impressive, and the scenes flow together better than the last few Harry Potters.  To touch on the acting, Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Professor Slughorn, whose facial expressions were hilarious.  Michael Gambon holds his own and gives an impressive performance.  Finally Alan Rickman is given a bigger role and he shines also.  The three main characters go through a lot with their relationships in this one and they handle it well.  I felt the film found the right balance between comedy and action.  If it weren't for the comedy the film would have that Dark Knight feel (loved the film) where it is entertaining but also very dark and depressing.  Overall, although Voldemort does not make an appearance, the film is the darkest and for me was the most entertaining.  If you liked the other movies (particularly since 3) you should really like this one.  Some things are changed from the book but nothing major.  You will laugh, maybe cry, and have a good time watching this film.
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway surfers is brilliant. It's like temple run but with more creativity. It has changing settings and locations for special events. For example in December it was Christmas themed and it had Santa and an evil Rudolph dog chasing you. Now it has a world tour setting with different cities. First it was NY and now it's Rio. It has helpful items like hoverboards and headstarts. It has many customization options from characters to boards.I recommend it to anyone who likes temple run and surfing or dodging trains and running away from cops and their police dogs. You'll be lost in the game for hours.
B009LDD1X0|5|It's Big Bang Theory... need I say more?
B007YJS7G4|4|Not a big movie watcher, but was looking forward to this release. Not at all disappointed, either, the movie was as good as the previews promised.<br />Portrayed the discrimination and bias faced by these men, balanced with the determination, courage and perserverence they displayed not ony to prove the naysayers wrong, but to do their duty, going above and beyond in defending this country, and the world against Hitler and the Nazi's.<br />The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, was it could have been a little less personal relationships in the end, and a little more reflective of their accomplishment's and success of their mission into--well, that would spoil it, so you'll have to watch.<br />Has peaked my interest, now I'm going to have to read up on them<br />On the this Memorial Day 58 years after these men battled more than just Hitler's Nazi's, Hats off to the 332nd.

Rather, the question is can we make machines which ARE rational.  My Asa H is such an attempt (R. Jones, Trans. Kansas Acad. of Sci. vol. 109, pg 159, 2006).

1449437524|5|This book was a gift from my son, because I have two dogs.  It's incredibly funny, to see the world as perceived by the dog. What seemed very bizarre or inexplicable before does become clear, but you have to stop laughing first. The situations and the unpredictable behavior of dogs appear in cartoon vignettes throughout the entire book. Dogs do have very &#34;strange&#34; behaviors (as seen by humans), but this little &#34;Oatmeal&#34; publication straightens us out in a hurry.  I haven't laughed this hard at a humorous book in a long time.  The other books published by Oatmeal (all featuring a main animal character) are equally funny, and I have bought all of them.  I hope there will be more in the future, because the humor is especially appealing to those of us owned by dogs or cats, but still can be appreciated by other independent souls as well.
B0071MV540|4|The movie took a while to get to the action, but after it did, it was great.  A really good entertaining movie :)
B00D6QUJ6U|3|The concert is great and I'm glad I purchased it except... the sound only comes through in PCM stereo and not DTS! Also, the video portion is OK, but nowhere near Blu-Ray quality. Save some money and just buy the regular DVD.

159463176X|5|This was my favorite book of Hosseini's so far.  He brings readers into his stories and tries to help us see the fragility of the human condition. I loved it.
0066214122|4|First off, I'm a die-hard Michael Crichton fan...absolutely LOVE his stuff...however -- 'Prey' is definitely a 'formula' novel...most notably a Crichton formula novel which borrow extensively from previous works like 'Jurassic Park' & 'Timeline'.  If you have read many of his other novels, this formula will become immediately apparent: Big corporation is messing with technology they don't fully understand nor appreciate, and in the process unleash something baaaad.  First it was the Dinosaurs when InGen toyed around with genetic manipulation where they shouldn't have...next we have a very similar company in 'Timeline' that wanted to send the elite on once-in-a-lifetime trips through time, using science again that was a bit beyond our control and now we have nanotechnology in 'Prey' that provides a frightening look at what *could* happen should this kind of near-future science fall into the hands of those who attempt to use it for all the wrong reasons.<br />Just because Crichton is using his 'formula' here, that doesn't mean he doesn't provide us with some great cliff-hangers and genuine surprises along the way...his writing talent is far too refined to have forgotten how to pull a few strings with the readers.  'Prey' begins with poor Jack, a reluctant house-husband with a wife who has quickly become one of the powerhouse leaders at Xymos (you guessed it, the 'big corporation' that funds experiments that go horribly wrong).  Her sudden and suspiciously odd actions make Jack begin to suspect that she (Julia) just might be having an affair.  He pushes this thought away every time more and more evidence begins to mount that this is no longer a theory and more likely a fact.  Her behavior seems erratic (at best), distant with him and the children and she tells small (but significant) lies which unravel the fabric of their relationship.  All this is shockingly interrupted when Julia is involved in an accident which sends her to the hospital.  Meanwhile an incredibly un-expected invitation by his former boss (who fired him under trumped up charges) is offered to Jack asking him to come back (sort of) to help Xymos figure out how to solve a problem with a program that Jack's technical team had designed some time before.  At first Jack is totally against going back under ANY circumstances...but as the problem with Julia becomes more of an immediate concern, he figures that maybe he could find out more about her supposed affair by accepting the offer.<br />This is where the rubber hits the pavement, so-to-speak.  This is where Jack becomes immersed in the world of nanoswarms, produced by Xymos for the Military to spy on the enemy.  As in all of Crichton's novels, nothing is as it seems, and the people who give the tours of the production facility know a lot more than they are letting on (always to the suspicion of those on the receiving end of the tour).  Jack has reason to believe Ricky (the tour-guide) is holding back crucial information on the little problem they have come up against.  It appears that the company has made a once-in-a-lifetime scientific breakthrough which has allowed them to begin full production of machines on the molecular level.  Millions of microscopic machines were accidentally vented to the Nevada environment and have a peculiar problem:  they won't come back...they seem to be multiplying on their own (which they just shouldn't be able to do)...they seem to be killing desert animals...oh, and they were programmed using a predator/prey program that Jack and his former team-mates created.  Just about everything that Ricky says turns out to be half-truths or outright lies from pretty much the beginning.  Jack almost immediately has a plan that nobody had previously thought about which will eliminate the nanoswarms...but if you know the typical Michael Crichton novel, you know that first, and even second plans usually go horribly wrong.  What exactly is Ricky hiding from Jack and just about everyone else?  How are the nanoswarms able to multiply?  How are they developing behavior that their programming says should be 100% impossible?  How is Jack's wife, Julia embroiled in all of this, and is she really having an affair?  And the biggest question of all: Can the nanoswarms be stopped...and if so, how?<br />Good questions and for the sheer fun of the story I gave 'Prey' 5 stars, but for re-telling a story told before in 'Jurassic Park' and 'Timeline' I give it just 4 stars.  Perfectly enjoyable even despite my reservations and I very much look forward to the future movie at the local cineplex, it ought to be a real nail-biter.e the nanoswarms able to multiply?

0804178747|5|Awesome book!! I love Lee Child. Have read all of his books!
B0000C23DO|5|this truly is the VERY best of the greatful dead.  for those of us who like the dead's music but who don't want to buy the endless and repetitive live albums, this collection fills the need.  i suppose true \\"dead-heads\\" would hate this album but, think of how much time and money can be saved by listening to this in the comforts of home, rather than travelling endlessly around the country (ooops, you can't really do that anymore, can you?)
B00A9T1HUO|5|I am thoroughly enjoying All That Echos. This CD is true to the quality of music and lyrics produced by Josh Groban.
B004TI5N38|2|The others a right.  This is a blatant knockoff of Lee Child and Jack Reacher.  I had read the other reviewers who said so but frankly had to see for myself.  My apologies I should have trusted you.  Baldacci owes Child royalties and an apology.

B000AARKOO|5|I've got mixed feelings about Ridley Scott's Medieval epic Kingdom of Heaven. On the one hand, it's a great movie and I've probably watched it half a dozen times so far. On the other hand, it seems like just another Hollywood propaganda film loaded with the same old \\"progressive\\" drivel we've been hearing for decades now. In this case, the message is pretty simple: organized religion is bad; multiculturalism is good. Luckily, the movie's good enough to make it worth watching despite the propaganda.    Briefly, Kingdom of Heaven tells the story of Balian, a blacksmith in France who joins his crusader father in the Holy Land, seeking forgiveness for murdering a priest and redemption for his wife who committed suicide. Knighted by his dying father, Balian enters the service of Baldwin, the leper king of Jerusalem, and ends up defending the city from a siege by the Muslims under Saladin after Baldwin dies and the Templars start a war under the new king, the evil Guy of Lusignan.    The movie presents Catholics as greedy, scheming, hypocritical, cowardly and strategically inept war-mongers who justify their atrocities as the \\"will of God.\\" Muslim leaders like Saladin, on the other hand, along with pure knights like Balian, are shown as noble, enlightened types struggling to sustain a multicultural \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" in Jerusalem where everybody lives side by side in joyful harmony regardless of race, creed, religion, blah, blah, blah. As usual, the forces of enlightenment and tolerance are surrounded by the forces of darkness--the evil Templars in particular. The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon get a very bad rap in this flick.    Now, I'm no fan of the Catholic Church and I don't know enough about the Crusades (yet) to say if any of this is historically accurate, but I really doubt if Twelfth Century Jerusalem was ruled by politically-correct liberals and it's hard to believe that Saladin was all that interested in living in peace and harmony with the Christian invaders. The not-so-hidden message in Kingdom of Heaven is basically just your standard \\"progressive liberalism\\" and New World Order multiculturalism dressed up in Medieval armor. In this sense, the movie seems completely ahistorical, a good example of Hollywood projecting its values onto the past.    Having said all that, however, I've got to admit that I really like this flick. Ridley Scott's a good director and there are moments in Kingdom of Heaven which achieve a real suspension of disbelief. Balian's suicidal cavalry charge in front of Raynald's castle; the coronation of Guy of Lusignan; the opening scenes in France; the funeral of King Baldwin, the leper: All of these scenes have a Medieval feel about them which makes Kingdom of Heaven one of the better historical movies I've seen. Ridley Scott (as usual) gets carried away with CGI effects--the armies are bigger, the siege machines more powerful than they could ever have been in real life--but the battle scenes are well done for the most part, very violent and grisly at times. You can preach Tolerance all you like, but people come for the battles. Movie violence is the Twenty-First Century equivalent of the gladiatorial games and Kingdom of Heaven delivers lots of blood and action.    The movie didn't do as well as it should have when it first came out, mostly, I think, because people saw it as \\"pro-Muslim\\" or at least pushing a message of tolerance towards Muslims which ran counter to the official anti-Muslim propaganda pouring out of Washington and the mainstream media at the time.  To make things worse, the theatrical release apparently cut a lot of material which developed the background and made the themes more clear. To be fair to Ridley Scott, the studios forced him to cut the original movie from 194 minutes down to two hours, so over an hour of footage is missing in the original release, which is the only version I've seen so far. In any case, it's worth checking out. Just be aware that many of the values expressed in Kingdom of Heaven have more to do with Twentieth Century Hollywood than Medieval Jerusalem.

B000002G7G|5|The concept of the whole album (save Murder Mystery)is one's search for love and redemption in a very unforgiving world.  \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" finds the protagonist searching for love with an unavailable man or woman (song never really says which makes sense in light of Lou's constant androgeny). \\"Candy says\\", as you stated, is Candy Darling's desire to be loved in a world which has forced him/her to hate her own skin.  Jesus is searching for love and redemption through religion.  Ive thought long and hard about \\"Beg. to see the light\\" and I believe its an acceptance of the writer's fate to simply acknowledge the futility of his pursuit (be it simple acceptance, love, redemption etc.) and let everything be just alright. Overall, this album and VU and Nico are beyond art and they have certainly outlasted the normally alloted 15 minutes.
B000002BSG|3|Virtual Insanity, complete with stunning video, is a great opening, funky and classy. Cosmic Girl is possibly even better, although the lyircs border on 'wacky' (&quot;It's a distant solar system, tried to phone but they don't list them&quot;). The title track, Alright and Everyday are also up there. But when the pace lets up on the album's second side, things get too sluggish with the ballads and didgeridoo music. Jay Kay just can't write that sort of song as well as he can write a funk or disco style tune. It may be quite 'pop', but to me that makes it easily digestible and refreshing. But this is no classic.
B001UTW7QU|4|Not at all bad series. J.J.Abrams can't disappoint you too much, he just can't. Anyways, definitely recommend to all sci-fi lovers.

0743297334|4|Rat-a-tat... Hemingway's prose comes out at a staccato pace in The Sun Also Rises.  One can imagine black and white scenes of a 1930's or 1040's movies with an actors, Humphrey Bogart for instance clipped voice reading the dialogue:<br /><br />\\"I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine.  They were cold.  Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back on the trees.  I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked the bottles and leaned the other against a tree.  Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.<br />\\"Let see that bottle,\\" he said.  he pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank.  \\"Whew!  That makes my eyes ache.\\"<br />\\"Let's try it.\\"<br />The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.<br />\\"That;s not such filthy wine,\\"Bill said.<br />\\"The cold helps it,\\" I said.  We unwrapped the Little parcels of lunch.<br />\\"Chicken.\\"<br />\\"There's hard-boiled eggs.\\"<br />\\"Find any salt?\\"<br />First the egg, said Bill.  \\"Then the chicken.  Even Bryan could see that.\\"<br />\\"He's dead.  I read it in the paper yesterday.\\"<br />\\"No. Not really?\\"<br />\\"Yes Bryan's dead.\\"<br />\\"Gentlemen,\\" he said and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper.  \\"I reverse the order.  For Bryan's sake.  As a tribute to the Great commoner.  First the chicken;then the egg.\\"<br /><br />Hemingway worked meticulously at crafting his writing, whittling it down to the bare essence and The Sun Also Rises his first novel is a perfect example of this there are no extra phrases and much is left to the readers imagination, even Jake Barnes war injury which left him impotent is rarely mentioned but always a integral part of the story.  It is so stripped down that it is accessible to all with no need to get out the dictionary, although much is left for the reader to fill in.<br /><br />While Hemingway deftly crafts his characters, he does so with spare brush strokes, so much is left for the reader to fill in and life's experiences will shape how the reader perceives each.  Essentially there are four major character Jake Barnes the impotent writer/journalist, Brett, Lady Ashley, the twice married dissolute thirty-five year old  socialite, Mike Campbell, Brett's bankrupt fiance, Robert Cohn, a writer friend of Jake's, Bill Gorton another friend of Jake's who has recently arrived in Paris.<br /><br />Hemingway has taken a simple tale, with simple language of a journey to the running of the bulls in Pamplona and formed an intricate novel involving themes of masculinity, nature, religion and honor.  Masculinity is always in the background of The Sun Also Rises.  Jake and Bill rollick on the top of the bus drinking wine from bota bags held at an arms length with the Spanish laborers.  Brett , the temptress, the siren plays the counterpoint to masculinity.  All of the men are drawn to her even the nineteen year old Spanish bullfighter, Romero.<br /><br />As we learn the steers of Pamplona manage the bulls, it is the nature of things.  We note the beautiful Spanish countryside, the changes that the travelers pass through on their journey south through Spain to Pamplona.  We experience the cold water of the Itara river as Jake and Bill fish for trout.  Nature is always an essential part of the novel and contrasted with the bars and bottegas where wine and liquor flow freely.<br /><br />One can't read The Sun Also Rises without some thought of anti-Semitism.  Every time Robert Cohn enters the picture he is described as Jewish.  The other characters constantly denigrate him, while the reader wonders what he has done to be so despised.  He went off with Lady Brett on a trip previously and hopes to reenter the relationship.  It seems this was badly presumptuous and in bad form.<br /><br />There have been numerous explanations and interpretations of this.  The dismissive and portentous one, that it was commonplace of the literature of the time and so allowable.  There is a biographic one, in which The Sun Also Rises is a retelling of Hemingway's own trip to Pamplona and his loss of friendship during this time with Harold Loeb and created Cohn as a way to even the score so to speak.  There is the theory that of course, Hemingway was anti Semitic and there are countless others all of which quite frankly I do not understand.  I do know however that when reading The Sun Also Rises the reader must come to terms with this.  I'm not sure I am there yet.n the score so to speak.

B006LSZECO|3|Slow beginning, very entertaining, creative and captivating body, and disappointing ending to this novel.  I am not certain that I read a sequel if it were available.
B006LSZECO|4|Beginning is a little slow but about 100 pages in the madness begins. Keeps you thinking what's going to happen next! Wish the ending was better thought.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I had already came up with my own ending after reading Hunger Games and Catching Fire. This book was way more intense and kept me on my toes than the first two. There was more action for me to visualize in my head. Honestly I didnt like the ending to this trilogy probably because I invisioned things differently and tried to predict how it would end half way through it but over all it is a good book. Great twist on the story plot. And great ending to the Hunger games
B000JMKTLO|5|While the story is more than a little creepy, the book sucks you in.  Once you start reading, you can't put it down.

B00EL8I8IS|3|I would call the movie watchable.  It had an interesting enough start and concept, and the acting was fine.  But... with all the zombie movies and TV shows flooding the market in the last decades, it didn't really add anything new to the genre.  Slightly faster zombie, slightly better looking star, on a world tour.
B007IXWL2C|5|Loved this book and the final story in this trilogy. Definitely the best of the three. I highly recommend it.
0812932293|5|An incredible life that often has the pace and suspense of a well-crafted adventure novel.  Important lessons for the businessperson or entrepreneur...AND portrait of the culture and music of the last thirty  years as an added bonus.  One of the few business books you could enjoy on  vacation too.  I devoured it over a weekend and recommend it.
B0035LGXXO|5|I love this movie. It has been the inspiration for many other movies as well as current music. Can't go wrong with a movie that has helped other artists achieve success.

None of the clips for this album jumped out to me, but once I got to listen to them all the way through after purchasing, I was completely in love. Each band member are so talented at what they do and they make fantastic music. I'm stoked for the next album, so far they are 2 for 2! :) IF you're unsure, just buy it!!

B003ZSJ212|4|The astonishing thing is not that so many read certain reviews here (such as that of N. Lucius) but that so many responded positively to such blatant ignorance.    For someone to complain so vociferously about changes,  and then to ignorantly complain that other scenes were 'changed' (i.e., Luke's light saber training session on the Millenium Falcon) when they were in FACT exactly as presented in the original theatrical release from 1977 is ironic and humorous in the extreme - in spite of a handful of changes, these films are presented almost entirely as originally released, and in a quality approaching that of the film formats  (which, kiddies, is superior to the cute little HDTV setups so many of you are now used to) of the past.     These are beautiful transfers, from picture to audio quality, and are simply the best these films have looked in a home viewing situation. Yes, Lucas has made some minor changes here and there (and it is his right - he owns these works, regardless of what some minority of extreme fans may believe), but it really makes little difference in the impact of these works.  Goofy? Yes. Naive? Undoubtedly, but such things are the charm of films inspired by space opera and Saturday serials. Regardless of source material and inspiration, these films forever changed the landscape of cinema worldwide, and presentations for home viewing remind us why.    Don't listen to the envious, ignorant haters out there - the old flaws are there, the mistaken changes are present, and the films continue to shine as an example of world-building in cinema and as grand entertainment.
B000I9U972|5|If you want a stupid comedy to laugh at watch this! This is the best ever GOSH! What the heck are you waiting for?
B00B7FWWNA|5|I didn't have high expectations but I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a moving story but it also made me laugh out loud.  I thought the acting and the story were great.  Very enjoyable movie that I found entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|5|It's an interesting story from a medical standpoint, and opens up ideas on the universe and spirituality. I found it very positve.
B003O86FMW|5|Such an awesome sequel really creates such an addiction you don't want it to end... Well on to the final book!
B00BAXFJ5M|4|Always enjoy Baldacci.

0446677450|4|For better or worse, and despite its relative youth, it should be fair to note that by now Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a classic of the genre. Self-made millionaire Robert T. Kiyosaki, and his co-author Sharon L. Lechter, has written about the former's first-hand experience and opinions on making lots of money and retiring early. The book interestingly applies lessons learnt from Kiyosaki's own father and an inspiring rich father figure - who might or might not have actually existed despite the claim of this being a \\"real story\\" - to elucidate and expand on the author's theories. While Kiyosaki senior was a scholar and a government employee, he was a man of modest means with financial and job stability problems. The 'rich dad', in contrast, lacked formal education, but managed and grew a business empire. This man, also took his own son and Robert under his wings in Hawaii and imparted the lessons that form the basis for this book.<br /><br />Rightly or wrongly, the notion that a formal school or college education is not the ticket should displease many. Rich Dad, Poor Dad is foremost for people who share the author's goal of making money over a formal and structured education or community and civic respect. It does bear reminding that not everybody craves material riches and a Porsche or Porsche-like luxury. If you, however, are a budding capitalist then this book is a very good starting point. The insistence that one has to become materially rich is a given here. It contains both motivational and tactical examples of how to proceed, although both are presented at a relatively high-level. Lists are provided, systematic manuals or specifics are not. The advice is a motivational invitation to think differently and look at life with a different set of eyes.<br /><br />The author does advise financial, sales, marketing and legal knowledge as prerequisites and suggests income-yielding investments as the means to wealth. Stocks, additional real estate and other dividend-yielding vehicles are espoused over assets that depreciate. The author labels collecting objects as counterproductive to wealth and as liabilities. This is contradictory to most people's assumptions that a car, fridge, one's own house or university degrees are assets on one's balance sheet. Furthermore, the book separates the habits of the habitually 'poor' and habitually 'wealthy' with the former preferring safety, ignorance of investment vehicles or the law and abhorring money, while the latter take risks, think and calculate. The attributes of the rich are what the author reckons is needed to accumulate money. Loving one's job is not exactly a virtue in these pages. Being worried about losing money, cynical about potential and lazy are derided as keeping one poor. Paying taxes is also abhorred and labelled as \\"paying the government,\\" although why exactly paying to have healthcare, roads, a civic city or a clean environment is not paying and taking care of oneself or one's future is not logically clear.<br /><br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is motivational and also quite brash. The habits, as described, ring true and sound genuinely smart. Nevertheless, experienced investors or those looking for detailed descriptions and techniques will be disappointed. Instead, as mentioned, starting or reenergized capitalists are sure to fall in love here.espoused over assets that depreciate.

0786965614|5|This is a solid core book for DM's.  It's expensive compared to the cost of earlier monster manuals, but traditionally the first Monster Manual in an edition is a solid value and I think that's true here.  The 5E stat blocks are pretty compact and monster entries don't take up much space and the page count is high with 352 pages.  There are over 430 monsters and NPCs which makes the price per monster pretty good.<br /><br />This is a pretty book with slick glossy pages.  Personally, I not a huge fan of the slick pages as I've seen other books with the same type of pages have binding problems.  A core book like this will get a lot of use so durability is always a concern.  The binding on my copy seems done well enough.<br /><br />Monsters: there seem to be a good assortment of them.  I didn't notice many monster's I'd never seen before in the index, but I've been playing since the '70s.  The three ones I didn't immediately recognize were the Aarakocra, Magmin and Yugoloths.  The Aarakocra were a good monster that became an evil one in 4E.  The magmin where low level fire elemental thingys in the SRD.  The Yugoloths are like the 3rd, 4th?, incarnation of the old Daemons from the AD&D Fiend Folio and back to their original NE from CE in 4E.  I have not read the book from cover to cover so I don't know if there are some whole new monsters under one of the old name's listing, though I didn't immediately notice any.<br /><br />The major thing missing from the book is a listing of monsters by CR.  That's suppose to be in the DMG, but still.  WotC did release a free downloadable PDF has the CR listing, to address this, so props to them.  The Monster Manual has both a table of content and index that are almost the same, so why they couldn't have gotten rid of the back one and printed a Monster by CR list instead, I don't know.  It would have been nice to have monster random encounter tables as well.  I'm less concerned about those since they always go out of date the moment a new monster source is revealed.<br /><br />Overall this is a very solid core book DM's are going to want to get.  I'll give it 4 1/2 stars, taking off a half star for the lack of CR by level.  For Amazon I'll round up the score up to 5 stars.revealed.

B00CFTA6K8|5|I have enjoyed this series of three books - this being the middle installment.  There were differences between the book and movie so if you have just seen the movie - read the book also.
B004O4K4SQ|4|This game seems like a classic, yet modern at the same time. I spent plenty of time playing it. Excellent graphics, a decent story line, and a good focus on upgrades and cash. Just remember, Ignore the reviews of one stars. They are from people whose game crashes. Its well worth the money
B0056BMK6K|4|This was a pretty good read. It is very informitive and I hope I can follow his instructions. Thanks alot.
B00992CF6W|5|Heck! This Game iz AWESOME!!! However, updates don't come very fast so I've been stuck on update 0.14.3 for like FOREVER!!! But I do have plans for what I and probably those reading this review want too! Pistons: sure 0.13.0 was awesome with giving us starters for redstone, but they gave us more of the advanced stuff and not the essentials like pistons which is needed for the really cool redstone contraptions. I personally want pistons because I like moving stuff around and making cool castle gate doors etc! The END: If you really like fighting the Ender Dwagon then this request is for you! I personally think we need the END for many different reasons 1. Finishing that END Coaster you've dreamed of finishing. 2. Completing MCPE. The Wither: Ok I know a LOT of people wanted this since we got the nether in 0.12.0 because they wanted to do that spawn a million Withers party and get that gosh darn nether star. Horses: Yeah riding horses is awesome so yeah the only way of getting saddles is by lucky pulling one out of the water when fishing. END OF STORY! Ignore the pletei at the end! I couldn't erase it! 游땑游낼游쓇릟 :P<br />pletei
B007BVOEPI|5|We're all hooked!  Very violent and sexually graphic though.  But the story really pulls you in.
0156027321|5|this is great.  this book arrived in excellent condition and ready to wrap.  can't wait to give my gifts this year
B00KV8E0TS|5|The acting was amazing... we're dealing with two very flawed people who struggle with their own demons while trying to catch other demons.  You may not like the main characters... but you come to respect them and the job they're trying to do... which would give most  people nightmares.<br /><br />The cinematography was impressive, fluctuating between the depressing chemical/oil landscape that is the gulf coast's heritage and the stunning, verdant garden that is the south.<br /><br />The supporting cast adds more depth, which, like quicksand, will draw you in further.
B008EEZ64Y|5|Very very very well written an i really enjoyed the plot and twists. Will recommend to anyone young or old!!
B00LXLM05I|5|G3eeeeeeemssssss
B002ZG981E|3|About the movie: I was not particularly impressed with the movie. To me, it depended a lot on the special effects and gee-whiz concepts. I felt that the special effects (and they are pretty spectacular) and some of the editing (esp. editing emphasizing the unusual - and sometimes brilliant - concepts) sometimes got in the way of the story, leaving me a little confused. I was left feeling that I wanted to see the movie over again to catch more of what was going on. An opposing example is Avatar where the effects were major but did not really get in the way of the story. Or see much older example of a story not impeded by effects; look at the movie Dark Crystal.    About the purchase: The 2-disks set was exactly what was promised and was delivered promptly and trouble-free. The picture in BD was vivid and detailed. Be aware that the BD Live download can take a little while the first time you watch the movie.

B001FB55I0|2|I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much.  Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring.  There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me.  For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.<br /><br />Peter J.

B00DF0ZP8Y|3|I bought mine in store at a big store. I got mine for 3.27 was originally 12.97. I was shocked it was that cheap too! I'm disappointed that the song was a tid bit of the original version. It is pretty, but, for the 10 second song, it's just not worth more than I honestly paid for it. It is heavy, due to the water globe size on the wand. I bought it because I'm a frozen fan. Look in store first.
B008FTAAG2|4|I am always listening to music. From metal, to electronic, to rap. Though, my music tends to be very selective. I like finding new bands that have a unique sound to them, and this happens to be one of my newest additions. I was referred to the song \\"Blood\\" by my fiancee and I have to say, I wasn't really impressed. I heard it about a week later on the radio and ever since then I've been hooked on it. It isn't the best album in the world, but it's definitely worth a listen.
B000AARKOO|4|This movie was a lot better than Alexander and just about as good as Gladiator (Rome seems to be more sexy than tales of the middle-east).  During the time of the crusades where Christian hordes from France decided to kill all non-Christians in the middle-east because \\"they were told by g-d,\\" Orlando Bloom flees after he has murdered a priest.  He ends up in the desert and running out of water and happens on an oasis and a horse.  Two Arabs challenge him for the horse which they state is theirs.  Bloom kills one and lets the other one live because he needs him to show him how to get to Jerusalem.  It will turn out later that the man that he spares is the son of the Arab king and each man will continue to do favors for the other throughout the movie. <br /> <br />Bloom ends up in Jerusalem and catches the eye of the \\"married\\" sister of the local king.  She eventually starts to sneak off to see him.   Her brother the king, does not have long to live because he has leprosy and the woman's husband will become the new king through her when she dies. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie involves clashes of egos between the new king, Bloom, the Church leader and everyone else and it appears that egos totally blind men even if it will cause their death. <br /> <br />There are some excellent battle/siege at the castle scenes as good as Troy, Arthur, Lord of the Rings and all the other movies of that genre. <br /> <br />Bloom makes and excellent hero and he seems to make the impossible happen.  I really liked this movie.
B0031KC8OC|5|I can't believe I missed this.  Kristen Bell is awesome as SNARKY Veronica and she is now a favorite super hero to me.  Up there with Buffy to me! Can't wait to see what happens.

B00IIUATDM|5|Excellent movie
B000000W5B|5|Sue me, but I'm from the camp that says \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" is one underrated record. Four stars is really more accurate for the Stones standard, but for many other lesser bands, this would be a career highlight. I agree with many others in the \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" cult that this album gets most of its flack for following the Stones' most prolific period. Sure it's a step down from the \\"big four,\\" but come on, people. This still put the Stones above many other bands of that period, since they were coming down from arguably the highest peak in rock music at the time. All right, let's get to the actual songs before I lose my cool. \\"Dancin' With Mr. D\\" is considered by some to be a low point, but I digress. It rocks, in a mellow, funky way like most of the album, but it still rocks and has an enjoyable beat. \\"100 Years Ago\\" is quirky but also enjoyable. It stands as a unique song in the Stones catalog, as it is so schizophrenic in it's soft to hard tempo changes. \\"Coming Down Again\\" is the most mellow of the mellow, featuring Keith in an underrated song that obviously seems to be about his heroin addiction at the time. \\"Heartbreaker\\" is undeniably the high point in terms of rockers, as well as one that people actually recognize as a minor hit. I like this one a lot, it rocks in an incredibly \\"groovy\\" way (no pun intended) and it should have been on \\"Forty Licks.\\" Another one of their most underrated. Then comes the center of controversy in an already controversial album-\\"Angie.\\" Legend has it that this is the Stones hit song you either love or hate. I admit that I hated it at first, but if any song by them has come to grow on me, it's this one. Now I think it's one of their great ballads, even if it's no \\"Wild Horses.\\" Some may find it to be a cheesy love song (therefore the Stones out of their element), but I think it doesn't turn into a joke. It's not amazing, but it's a nice effort, especially the whispered portion. Then we have \\"Silver Train\\", which although is not one of their best rockers, is still enjoyable. The lyrics are funny too if not taken seriously, showing the \\"shoot first and ask questions later\\" philosophy of their one night stands. And I don't think the filler really starts until \\"Hide Your Love\\" which is tedious and \\"Can You Hear the Music\\", which is just too cornball. Then we have the finale, \\"Star Star,\\" the one other great rocker of the album. If you consider yourself to be \\"mild-mannered\\" or \\"easily offended,\\" stay the hell away from this track, though I honestly think any true low down, dirty Stones fan will be right there shouting out that foul, but catchy chorus with Mick. I know I do. So, there you have it (sorry about the lengthiness). Some hate \\"Goats Head Soup\\" for it's quirks, but what I can say, they are fine by me and make things interesting. Check it out, owning one more Stones album won't hurt.
B002KQ6BT6|5|Very good exiting couldn't put it down. A page turner look forward to reading his<br /> Next book  inferno..I will buy it next.
B009EP3DJM|2|It's not that I'm surprised because it is similar to everything she's released so far, which I also own.  It just seems less tongue in cheek this time. This isn't really an album as much as a group of similar songs that she and her producers feel have a chance to break big on radio.  As an album, it is the same thing over and over.  The songs don't build to climaxes, they are climaxing all the time.  It's like making love to that unfortunate woman who suffered from hundreds of involuntary orgasms a day and recently killed herself.  It's not sexy, it's sexed.<br /><br />It's ironic that this is what female empowerment has come to...a shameless, vulgar pursuit of earthly pleasures devoid of love, commitment, and satisfaction. It's sad that this album is so typical today. Now, we will have to endure a remix album, ugh. Next time Kesha, aim higher.  You are smarter than this.
B00BWBHIUG|4|I like this game a lot it's a lot of fun the only things that I don't like is its hard to get perals or maybe I don't  have bought experience in this game yet so I give it only 4stars
B000GDH9JQ|5|This movie arrived on time. It arrived flawless and my Father has enjoyed watching it several times.  The review was spot on.  Great job,
B00IT3KQMC|2|After such a great 50th anniversary special, I expected more for future episodes of the series. What we get are boring lame episodes with not much adventure, too much soap opera drama, and bad plots. They even changed the theme music again, only this time it sounds absolutely dreadful! I liked Peter Capaldi's Doctor though. He is a great actor, makes a very different Doctor to the others, which takes some getting use to at first, but once I got use to him, he made a terrific Doctor. Clara unfortunately turns into a bratty companion in this one who looks at the new Doctor as a selfish prat, but it's actually her that turns into one. Whatever happened to the sweet, caring, and yet strong young girl that we met in season 7? She's the one who seems uncaring and selfish in this season. And her new boyfriend is just as bad as her. And with him in the picture, it just gives the writer an excuse to put more soap into the series. The only episodes I was actually impressed with were &#34;Time Heist&#34;, &#34;The Caretaker&#34;, &#34;Mummy on the Orient Express&#34;, and &#34;Flatline&#34;. The rest were so lame. If it wasn't for those episodes and Peter Capaldi, this season wouldn't even be worth watching. I suggest checking this season out, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on buying it.
B000TDGGRY|4|If you've enjoyed the rest of the books in the series, be sure to get this one.  Rollins keeps up the great work.
B000MR9D5E|5|This is a series one must have for their collection. The quality of picture, the narration and  the places covered are so unique one cannot leave the screen before it finishes.
B0064BCNA4|5|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B00DXP7L88|3|did not like ending
B0009GV9LO|5|There are many reasons to buy this DVD, but the first is Aragall, acknowledged by his peers as the finest tenor of the 20th century. The beauty of his voice is unparalleled and his acting is such that he is Cavaradossi. He is supported by Eva Marton who is very believable as Tosca and Ingvar Wixell who is deliciously evil as Scarpia,not as good as Ruggero Raimondi, which would have made it a dream casting. Daniel Oren's conducting shows the promise to come. I have friends who do not think they are opera lovers but after hearing Aragall's \\"Dammi i colori\\" beg to listen to the whole opera.Puccini sung as he intended.
B00004R99M|5|Disney again places out a fantastic performance with an all star cast of the 50's and 60s Starring Dick Van Dyke as both Bert and Mr. Dawes Sr.; David Tomlinson who starred in many Disney films of the time including Bednobs and Broomstiks stars as Mr. Banks also in the movie are Ed Wynn Karen Dortice and Matthew Garber and of course keeping in the Disney Tradition the Magic continues in this movie.  Walt had such a wonderful imagination to make this wonderful book come to life and all the great special effects were wonderful especially for 1964! The scene where they go into the paintings where we here Jolly Holiday and Supercalifragilisticexpialidcious where Bert and Mary dance with penguins and other characters in an all animated villiage too bad this site doesn't allow for 10 stars because it so much more deserving than a 5 star rating!

B00AVIQPJQ|5|Good old movie
B001OQCV2E|4|The movie's premise: As predicted by the prophecies of an apocalyptic end in the Mayan calendar, Solar flares send neutrinos which chemically and physically alter the Earth's subterranean core, causing Earth Crust Displacement, a theory proposed by Professor Charles H. Hapgood in the 1950s.  The problem with this, however, is that it follows too closely to Lawrence E. Joseph's 2012 Apocalypse, with a hodge-podge collection of pseudo-sciences, real scientific theories, and multiple conspiracy theories.<br /><br />The movie dabbles into realism here and there; however, it's mostly special effects.  Which in this case is AWESOME!<br /><br />When limo driver Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the Earth's impending destruction - something predicted by Geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) - he morphs into a stunt car driver, Houdini in vehicular transport, a man capable of evading the Earth's cataclysmic forces, be it earthquake, tidal wave, or volcano explosions by the skin of his teeth.  He scoops up his kids, ex-wife (Amanda Peet), her boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), and after some helpful insight from a crackpot conspiracy theorist named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) living in Yellowstone National Park, begin their escape towards a secretive last chance for species continuity.  Luckily for them, Gordon is a novice pilot with the skills of a Blue Angel, and his connections to a Russian billionaire may help the group survive.<br /><br />If the special effects are the lead role in this film, then the cast is clearly option 1A.  In addition to those already mentioned, the cast is rounded out by Dannie Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, and Stephen McHattie.  They do a wonderful job despite having little to work with in the way of script.<br /><br />In the end it's a little too much Day After Tomorrow with a Deep Impact finale and there is nearly no character development, but the FX carries the film like a giant boat on an apocalyptic wave.  Sure, it's almost completely implausible, some of the science is laughable at best, and the script is very minimal, but this is just one of those popcorn movies with which a grain of salt and an empty head are necessary.t completely implausible, some of the science is laughable at best, and the script is very minimal, but this is just one of those popcorn movies with which a grain of salt and an empty head are necessary.
B00008H2LB|5|I had been wanting this CD for a long time.  Then I got tired of wanting it so I totally forgot about it when it was released.  The next thing I knew was seeing the CD and remembering about it.  So I bought it.  This CD is awesome.  After Hybrid Theory I thought Linkin Park would fail with their career because it was such a great CD and you can't top that.  When Reanimation was released, I thought Linkin Park had failed.  But they came out with Meteora and it is great...<br />Foreward-It's not even a song its just a beat skip it 0/10<br />Don't Stay-Chester is great 9/10<br />Somewhere I Belong-Mike is awesome in this song, but this song is just overplayed on MTV and radios 9/10<br />Lying From You-Chester does great with his &quot;screaming&quot; and Mike does good rapping but not the best 8/10<br />Hit the Floor-This song wasn't good at the very beginning but I kept on listening to it and its great now 9.5/10<br />Easier to Run-It's &quot;ok&quot; 8/10<br />Faint-AWESOME!10/10<br />Figure.09-This chorus will get stuck in your head for the longest time 10/10<br />Breaking the Habit-soft song but not catchy 7/10<br />From the Inside-Brad does great and Mike is good too 8.5/10<br />Nobody's Listening-Another song that will get stuck in your head 10/10<br />Session-Cure for the Itch is better 6.5/10<br />Numb-sounds like &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; but also good 9.5/10<br />Overall this is a great album and a Solid Outcome from Linkin Park
1781162646|5|Riveting, emotional, suspense and tear jerking. Couldn't put it down. Read in two nights. Tender, surprise ending. One of Kings best books by far.
B002RSQGQK|4|Not my favorite Hitchcock movie, but still very good
B000FS9MV0|5|This is a great CD - she has a fun way to put over a song and a really good voice - I have enjoyed listening to it so much.
B00BMKH5NW|1|Terrible! Worst book I have ever read! The main character is written so bad and the fanfic she writes is a rip off of Harry Potter. I really wanted to like this book because I liked the idea of a fanfic writer as the lead of the story. But she was such a weakly written character with no character growth what so ever. The Simon Snow parts of the story were so out of order it got in the way of the story telling.
6305165912|5|Careful with this one: it's all about quirky exchanges from its quixotic characters (note Goodman's brilliant performance), and not about plot. Most viewers will spend too much time trying to follow the mystery, and will get  frustrated watching Bridges and Goodman not getting on with it but bowling  and talking. This is equivalent to watching the Big Sleep (the template for  &quot;Lebowski&quot; -- the Coen Bros. say the film is their old hippie  friend cast in the lead of the Big Sleep) and wishing Bogart and Bacall  would stop talking and get on with the mystery, itself impossible to  decipher. If you can stop worrying about the mystery and just relax, the  film ranks with Python's Holy Grail for hilarious exchanges and individual  scenes. Frequently my roommate and I will put on the DVD just to watch one  or two choice scenes, or recount the exchanges to each other verbatim, as  we might do about the Holy Hand-Grenade in Python. Even better than Raising  Arizona, though the latter is plot driven.

B007BRJYF2|5|I passed some time with my ten year old daughter playing with this App.  She and I very much enjoyed it.  With two pairs of eyes and two minds, it goes a lot quicker and was not so frustrating.  We finished the game in about two sittings.  It was good clean fun and we enjoyed some quality time with each other.  Take a risk and buy it... if you have a \\"tween,\\" you might enjoy the time spent with him/her on this game~
B001BKVWYG|5|Nice collection of songs.
B009OJ01HA|4|Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins are a great match.  The movie keeps you guessing to the end.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B001OKGV6W|2|The video would stop playing every few minutes.  Contact is a great movie but the player sucks.  Word word word
B004XUMMFE|5|Great show cancelled before its time, be sure to watch the feature film &#34;Serenity&#34; to kind of have full closure. A+
B00JFBCDD2|5|Great
B006OCM0G0|5|This app is awesome! I play it all the time, but the only problem is it takes a little while to load!! you are able to decorate your shop how ever YOU want, and make food to serve to your customers! I definintly recomend this app!!!
B003IKMR0U|5|Steve Jackson Games is known these days for games you can break out and play to completion in less than an hour; perhaps even a half hour. Zombie Dice is a game where two or more players can finish a game in TEN MINUTES, and still have a pretty good time doing it. Extremely portable, as well.<br /><br />For your money, you get a heavy cardboard dice cup with lid that doubles as storage, the dice themselves, and the instructions. Dice are printed with three symbols: brains, blasts, and feet. Players are zombies; each round consists of a player rolling to see how his victims fare. Brains count as points for the player, whereas feet means the victim escaped, and a blast symbol indicates that the victim not only escaped, but let you have it with a shotgun! A player may keep rolling more dice and more rounds, but if he accumulates three shotgun blasts, he loses ALL his points for the round, and must hand off to the next player... so part of the fun is knowing when to stop!<br /><br />It's fast. It's funny. It's fun. Recommended for all fans of zombies and dice games.
0451196716|5|I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, but some of his books and short stories are pretty good, and I truly loved this novel and regard it as his best.<br />King would no doubt be amazed to hear that anyone regards \\"The Long Walk\\" as his \\"best\\" book; it's one of his earlier books, written in the \\"Carrie\\" era when John Travolta was king of pop, and it was originally a \\"Bachman\\" novel - that is, written when, for experimental purposes, King hid his light under the bushel of a less famous pseudonym.<br />Well, his later novels might have a more mature \\"style\\" and might flow easier, but the pace of this one is more tense and the characters are remarkably likable.  And I'm amazed at how much confusion there is about what happens at the end.  Reasonably intelligent people giving the ending an adequate amount of thought should have little trouble figuring it out.<br />Set in a futuristic era, ruled by a military dictatorship personified by \\"The Major\\", the story is about 100 boys of high-school age who set off on a \\"Long Walk\\" which requires them to maintain a pace of 4 miles an hour, come steep hills, hell, or high water.  Anyone who has walked a treadmill knows that this is quite a brisk walking pace.  The ostensible goal is \\"The Prize\\" - everything that you want for the rest of your life.<br />When a Walker drops below 4 miles an hour, he gets a warning.  Three warnings are all that a Walker will get, though an hour without a warning enables the Walker to get rid of one warning.  If a Walker slows down below 4 miles an hour while he's walking with three warnings, he's eliminated from the race.  With extreme prejudice.  By soldiers in a half-track armed with rifles.  The winner is determined after 99 Walkers have been eliminated.<br />Although this is both an early novel and a Bachman experiment, it's still vintage King - a macabre walk of death taking place in a recognizable middle-class setting.<br />So King makes the occasion as festive as positive, adding his normal helping of cheerleaders, gym squads, Cub Scouts, Little League players, Italian fruit merchants, Grant Wood families, civic clubs, and automobile salesmen to the mix of spectators that cheer on the Long Walkers and roar at the crack of the rifles - as usual, this is King's way of accentuating the horror that he has created by \\"mainstreaming\\" it.<br />Still, speaking as one who utterly despises endurance athletes, I see tremendous possibilities in this idea.  If one could find a way to eliminate the lion's share of many thousands of real-world smug cliquish androgynous leisure-class weekend warriors that clog up metropolitan areas with their self-loving marathon fests and who clog up their other environs during the remainder of the week, what a finer, happier world we would live in!<br />But the graphically-portrayed deaths of these boys aren't enjoyable at all.  They are both pointless and heroically tragic.  Even while making the Walkers very recognizably and coarsely adolescent, King is also able to make them quite endearing in their own way, much more endearing than the yuppie scum who participate in real-life marathons.  As did other readers, I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the Walkers, made especially poignant by the knowledge that they had no hope of meeting again after the conclusion of the Walk.<br />King's \\"message\\" is somewhat garbled by the curious \\"game show\\" quotations that precede most chapters, but it becomes clearer when a later chapter instead begins with a radio announcer's call from the second Cassius Clay/Sonny Liston fight:  \\"The blood has begun to flow...Clay is killing him...Clay is killing him...Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how to describe this scene.\\"<br />Clearly, King means for this novel to be a \\"statement\\" against the violence of sports culture.  It's a typical left-wing bogeyman, as is the right-wing military dictatorship that organizes \\"The Long Walk\\" as both ritual and money-maker.  In real life, the intellectualoids who govern us would never tolerate the rule of a military that they hadn't already taken over, as far back as the McNamara era.<br />And as athletes become wealthier and more yuppified, violence in professional sports has become less, not more prevalent, Mike Tyson notwithstanding.  There is scarcely a millionaire sportsman today who would ever do anything as gauche as engage in open warfare for the good of the team.<br />And while King agonizes over the \\"culture of violence\\", in the real world, young boys are severely disciplined for even having violent fantasies, such as bringing cap pistols onto school grounds or pointing an index finger at a rival and yelling \\"bang\\".<br />Is the stench of violent death that pervades the world of \\"The Long Walk\\" any worse than the stench of antiseptic that pervades our own?  And for all of the horror of the fictitious world that he created in \\"The Long Walk\\", is Stephen King aware of how relatively ATTRACTIVE it also is?<br />He's on the right track when he describes the Major's presence as \\"very masculine and overpowering\\".  The world of the Long Walk is all that and it is also scrupulously fair - both in the un-coerced manner in which Walkers participate and in the way that the rules of the Walk are disclosed beforehand and enforced honestly during the Walk itself.<br />\\"The Long Walk\\" is an excellent story which attacks largely non-existent targets, a story about a world not as nightmarish as the author intended, but considerably more alluring.<br />In another setting, Stephen King himself has repeated the maxim that \\"it is the tale, not he who tells it.\\"  He doesn't know how right he is here.<br />I'm giving King 5 stars for this novel, but I'm also ordering him to re-read the 1948 Ray Bradbury short story, \\"Pillar of Fire\\", for a more accurate view of what the future looks like now.
B00CWY76CC|5|This is a very entertaining game. You get to escape from a number of locked rooms through finding clues and solving puzzles. Highly recommended to puzzle lovers. Mind twisting fun.
B007THA4FI|1|This work is a disjointed and nonsensical treatment of a grubby English small town.  It is impossible to like anyone.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Diana Gabaldon has done it again.  Weaving the lives of 8 characters and making the readers love them all. The only bad part is now we have to wait 4 years for the next book to come out.  But at least we have the TV series to hold us over until then. We can get maybe 3 to 4 books on film by the time the next book comes out
0440237688|5|The Giver is an amazing novel. It was the first I'd ever read of this genre when I was probably in 4th grade when I got it in a book swap. I ate it up, and it sparked my insatiable appetite for stories like this. The Giver came before Hunger Games, Fahrenheit 451, and even Uglies for me. If you have a young adult or are a young adult, I'd certainly recommend it, even if you've read it before and lost you're copy! Reread, thankfully The Giver is full of nuances, and little bits of info you don't necessarily pick up on the first time. Now for my summary:<br /><br />The Giver is about an 11 year old boy. His name is Jonas. He's grown up in a perfect society, everyone's happy, there is no want or hunger, and everything is decided for you. Making decisions is dangerous of course, so here everything from your food to your spouse is chosen for you by the council. In this world, when you turn 12 you're job is chosen for you! What an exciting time! Jonas is attending his ceremony of twelves when he is assigned to be the next receiver, the one who holds all of the communities memories, whether pleasant or not.<br /><br />To find out how the rest goes, read the book!
B004WCTLNY|3|Let's put it this way, it took me four or five tries of watching this movie before I saw all of it; I kept falling asleep.  Not exactly Matt Damon's most exciting work.  I have seen worse though and it does have an interesting twist. So if you suffer from insomnia...
B00EVW013E|3|Good for a two hour checkout from life. No more. Olympus Has Fallen is a much better cast and story.

B005KPDAYS|2|I became weary of House by season 8,it was falling into a bad void..Cuddy left,and she was a major character which held the show together...the addition of Park the oriental doctor did give the show a few laughs with her sparkling personality and wit. I think the writers overdid the Vicodin..putting it in the same category as heroin and other hard drugs. The whole thing got tiresome, and it seems the actors also tiring of the show, they made the supreme effort, but could not pull it off.Hugh Laurie has gone on to the music industry with his band, I wish him luck.
B00E4W40C4|4|It's better than the other Wolverine movie. Slow in parts, but that's normal for most movies.

B00FB029IU|4|The latest in &#34;new Dylan&#34; wunderkinds is 19 year old Jake Bugg, a Brit who sounds like he popped out of the Greenwich Village clubs with his enigma fully intact and a sophomore album called &#34;Shangri La.&#34; And yes, that's a compliment. He's plugged in and has Rick Rubin on his team to peel back any unnecessary varnish that might have gotten stuck to the kid had anyone tried to polish him up. He's such a young gun that his voice even sounds like it has acne. That nasal bleat on &#34;There's a Beast and We All Feed It&#34; could only come from someone too young to realize that he hasn't conquered the world just yet, but old enough to think that it should be listening to his every pronouncement.<br /><br />Jake Bugg can run the gamut from that hard chugging opener to the more introspective &#34;Me and You.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;All these people want us to fail<br />But I won't let that happen now.&#34;<br /><br />He sings this line like he's a knight coming to a rescue. The kid excels in earnestness. The closest I can recall another album that believed in itself so definitively was Ryan Adams when he released &#34;Gold,&#34; and I like &#34;Shangri La&#34; so much more than that album. His age is not a hindrance as he tackles some adult themes on &#34;Storm Passes Away,&#34; along with a decent pedal steel, or the street denizens of &#34;Messed Up Kids.&#34;<br /><br />There is a lot of raw talent on &#34;Shangri La,&#34; and it's good to hear a young talent that isn't spun off the hot-making machinery of some TV Talent contest. You may have to get past the nasal twang in the young man's voice (which is why he wouldn't have lasted an audition for the likes of &#34;American Idol&#34;), but give yourself an opportunity and you'll hear what sounds to me like a first class singer-songwriter on the way up. Jake Bugg is the real deal.
B008BQ8VOC|5|Love this show.  It keeps you guessing, but certainly exposes the underbelly of the legal profession. It had characters you hate to love and some you love to hate.

0064407667|5|The first book of A Series of Unfortunate Events is called The Bad Beginning. As you will find out in the very first chapter, the Baudelaire children (Violet, Sunny, and Klaus) experience a very unfortunate event. I will not specifically tell you what happens because I don't want to ruin it. Besides, you'll find out soon enough! <BR>Because of this unfortunate event, Violet, Sunny, and Klaus are forced to live with a relative. Mr. Poe, a man that will utterly annoy you later in the series, helps find their relative. The Baudelaire children end up living with Count Olaf, a very, very, distant relative. I can't begin to describe what he looks like or what he acts like because it would hurt you both physically and mentally. It would also ruin the fun of this book.<BR>If you are interested in reading a popular series with humor and tragedy, I would highly suggest this series.

0803726570|5|I have loved this book for a long time and as a teacher of small children I find it an invaluable asset when we are at Halloween time talking about friendships and being scared. This book provides positive role models for how people can help each other and become friends who will support each other. The children love the repetitive language and the introductions of the different characters through mishap. The illustrations are clear and captivating.

B00GKKTZZU|5|Kresely has done it again! 'Dark Skye' is just what I needed from the next installment of IAD. It's the perfect mix of love, paranormal activity, and suspense! I could not put it down! Melanthe and Thronos' story is one you'll get frustrated with but it's oh so worth Lanthe and Thronos' passion isn't like any other in the IAD series! Thronos is so sheltered in his adult life and has no idea what awaits him after he truly captures Lanthe after centuries! These two have such a love and hate relationship... There are times you will want to just say &#34;screw this!&#34; You'll get a healthy dose of Nix and some inside to what's going on in her crazy world! Enjoy the ride!
B009AMANH4|5|Great product.
B0000399WI|5|This is brilliant. I have seen it twice and I recommend it to all my friends.<br />Tim Robbins plays a banker (Andy) that was sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover, whose quiet demeanor was a cover for his iron-will, determination and inner strength. Morgan Freeman, plays friend and cell mate, Red, represents the rest of us, who are on a journey to discover what made Andy tick. Both actors put up an excellent performance that keeps one enthralled in the film, wanting to know everything they do, think, and how they develop over the course of their years in prison.<br />The irony in this film struck me most. From the little ironies such as whether Andy really murdered his wife, to the secret behind his &quot;obsession&quot; with movie star posters. It was subtly presented with maximum impact. <br />I have read Stephen King's book and I think that this film is a very good film portrayal of his writing with charaters that adhere closely to the book, and are very well-explored by the two experienced actors. Definitely worth watching.
B004ZN9UZO|5|not something you'll hear copied on some lame reality tv show full of conformists. This is to be LISTENED to and enjoyed.
B00DP4M6FK|5|Being one like most collectors of Yes, I have gone through countless versions of the same album(s) for years (5 different sets owned of at least the first 10 album releases.)  Going from vinyl to CD (various remasters since the CDs first came about, gold CDs, DVD Audio 5.1, SHM CD's from Japan, Warner Bros Japan Fragile 5.1 SACD, Audio Fidelity SACD hybrids and finally this box set).  The AF releases CTTE and GFTO are definitely lacking in comparison to the counterparts in this set, often less \\"airy\\" and slightly harsher, to these ears.  Remastering from 2013, this is the pinnacle of the Yes catalog sets with the first 8 being my favorites, and without a doubt, rivaling even their best vinyl counterparts including the beloved MFSL LPs!!!  Pricey for the quality?...Sort of, but when you consider this is a 16 piece set, (13 albums (15 discs) and a bonus disc) the cost is $29.26 per album and bonus disc or 25.25 per disc, considering 2 are TFTO and Yessongs double discs.  Packaging is jewel case rather than mini-LP, and the box is well designed, unlike other collections that kind of just throw the discs into the package, ala the Pink Floyd Deluxe box sets.  If you can afford it, get it, BUT PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A HYBRID 2 CHANNEL SET, like all that have come before and after.  Although the 5.1 versions are slowly coming out on Blu-ray 5.1 audio, neither the titles, nor release dates are set and I can't imagine Mr. Wilson taking time to do the whole Atlantic catalog, with everything else he does.  So I would recommend picking up the Blu-rays as they come out, choosing your favorites, but picking up this set for the BEST SET in stereo available, if sound is important to you.  Cheers...8)

B008XG1X18|5|I feel like this app is less glitchy than the website and the controls are more intuitive. Love that I can swipe back and forth from the main screen and the zoomed in pin so seamlessly. I also like the updated feature with the long tap for pinning instead of having to hit the button.

B000002H70|4|i think that this is the cure's best album. my favorite song is same deep water as you. i onyl gave it four stars because the album gets boring very fast and isnt applicable to anyone outside of cure fans (im just starting to get into them, i dont like them that much). if you think you like the cure, start here or with a greatest hits.

0486437507|5|I owned this book a long time ago -- and may buy myself another copy.  The other reviews here give good opinions and recommend various stories and chapters in this book -- but do not seem to say what this book is ALL ABOUT.  For those who have never heard of this classic, here is a summary of the book's plot.  \\"The King In Yellow\\" is about a book, (called \\"The King In Yellow\\"), that drives people insane, or nearly insane, when they read it.  The various chapters detail what happens to various people when they read this book.    It is a masterpiece, but must be read carefully and slowly.  Do read it.  Your patience will be rewarded!
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is so, fun! And plus it's FREE! It's totally worth it. There's chating, killing and that's not all there's MONSTERS! This is the BEST the BEST the Best! If u don't buy it there's something wrong with u.

Its not often you can buy a CD, play it for the first time, and say to yourself, \\"This is one hot CD\\"...I know I'll be playing it over and over again in my car...lots of good beat, and she's just an awesome female singer as well as a fantastic entertainer...this will be the hottest CD this Christmas season, is my prediction!!
B005721Y7Y|5|This movie is so great. I had already seen it once but I just rented it so that I could watch it again because I like it so much. The acting is awesome and I feel that this movie outlines (on some levels) the average American family.<br /><br />Would recommend this to any of my friends.
B009IEXKXI|3|This otherwise excellent story leaves a bad taste in your mouth  right up to the very end.  It insults the reader.<br /><br />Here is a story about a man who is supposed to have superior intelligence and character, having been chosen as a elite member of  the space program to Mars.<br /><br />He survives insurmountable odds outwitting the space program's very best.  One would expect to want cheer his survival but in the end he behaves no better than  a base oaf.  Too selfish to be kind even to a young chid admirer.<br /><br />No space program would select such a loser.

0385336691|5|This is probably Child's best book to date, with all the same quirky twists and wonderful plot lines, this book has everything, from suspense to action, from drama to rescue, this book is superb for those avid readers who enjoy a cracking read, which this book certainly is. If you're looking for high drama, high suspense and high action, then this utterly fantastic, and I cannot say that enough, for you, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone, and I mean it!
B00005T343|5|\\"Hannibal\\" (2001)<br />Finally, after the long wait, the much-anticipated sequel to one of the best films of the 1990's, The Silence of the Lambs, has arrived. We have waited 10 years for this movie, and now that it's released, many viewers and critics disliked it. In my opinion, the gruesome Hannibal was worth the wait.<br />The critics and viewers disliked it because it wasn't Silence of the Lambs-ish enough. Because it didn't have the intelligence or story that The Silence of the Lambs had. Hello, it's a different movie! Sure, some characters return and it's a sequel, but this movie isn't the crime drama that The Silence of the Lambs was. Ridley Scott's goal with Hannibal was to make a gruesome and gory romantic horror film, and in my books, he has certainly succeeded.<br />Many say the movie is boring at the start because \\"all Clarice does is look at a computer and study Hannibal Lecter.\\" Again, I have an argument against that statement. Clarice is developed a lot in the first half of the film. Her character is different now; she's stronger, more feisty, and she is now a full FBI agent. The way she moves and talks to people in the starting half brings Clarice's character into a whole new light, and I really liked that perspective. In The Silence of the Lambs, we knew a lot about Clarice and her past and her pains. With Hannibal, we get to learn more about her attitude and the way she sees life. I loved seeing the first half get off to a start which enables us to see different sides of the characters. Despite the title being Hannibal, this movie was way more about Clarice.  And the part about her just looking at computers and searching for Hannibal? Well, if you were haunted by endless dreams about the most terrifying cannibal in the world, I think you'd want to track him down and try to catch him, don't you? She isn't just looking at computer screens; she's thickening the plot. <br />Hannibal Lecter is way scarier, more vicious and more exciting in the sequel. He is now walking freely in Florence. Hannibal is funnier in this movie. When he starts to go on a murder spree, he sort of jokes about the death that is upon his victims. This isn't supposed to be funny, but I root for Hannibal and his series, and in this movie, Anthony Hopkins brings Lecter to life in such a classic cool style that's it's almost impossible not to be drawn into the wild antics of our favourite movie villain. One weird thing about him in this movie is that - spoiler area - he doesn't eat any of his victims, either that or we don't see him crunching and munching. Hannibal is displayed as more of a serial killer in this movie than a cannibal, which disappointed me somewhat. Never mind though, Hopkins makes the character interesting enough once again to stop us from moaning.<br />Ridley Scott's direction in this movie is superior. Fresh from his success with the massive Oscar-winning Gladiator, Scott turns this movie from a drama, to a thriller, to a romance, to a horror, to a black comedy and so on and so on. He mixes a lot of genres so there is something for everyone. Of course as you probably already know, this movie is mostly a horror film, and is definitely not for the faint-hearted, so don't go in expecting a black romantic comedy! Anyway, back to Scott's direction. Moodiness is the style that Scott presents his spectacular film in, and he endlessly uses touches to add that extra bit of perfection into the suspense scenes. I liked the way Scott keeps the level of intensity in the air at all times during the film, it added to the unpredictably and scariness of the film.<br />Hans Zimmer has done an excellent score for this film. The track about Clarice is really just quite brilliantly played. The music sort of expresses how Clarice is a gold-knuckles girl on the outside but a somewhat confused and frightened woman on the inside. Zimmer allows many of his \\"dangerous\\" sounding tracks to make us keep on task about the murders and gore in the movie. Zimmer, as usual, has made a winning musical approach to this movie.<br />All in all, Hannibal is a movie that grows and grows on you with each viewing. It's great to see our favourite and smartest baddie out in the open and seeking his next meal. If anything, this movie definitely confirms this character is one who'll never get tired or boring.<br />MY GRADE: A-
0792101448|5|A must see. Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda. Currently voted as the number 2 western(of all time) on the international movie data base's website. The first 10 minutes sell it all, so rather than me give away the plot, watch it. Directed by Sergio Leone and composed by Ennio Morricone, it couldn't fail.

B00T6NBG2I|2|I love hidden objects games. This game had a great storyline. But the game shuts it's self off. Then when I was close to finishing the game it stops . A message then appears on my screen saying the file was corrupted. I have to start over. Not a happy customer.
159463176X|5|Khaled Hosseini writes like an angel and is one of my favorite authors.  His third book does not disappoint.  In fact, the reader is quickly drawn into a fascinating cast of characters as he so powerfully depicts them.  You begin to care about what happens to each one, hoping their lives turn out well even when you know they may not.  He is more like an artist carefully sketching a profile and shading it delicately with nuance and subtlety to create a complex and realistic personality.  This book was a page-turner for me and I was sorry to reach the end.  More, please!
B00BWBHIUG|2|I probably would enjoy it more if it would stop losing connection on my kindle and restarting. Other that that the graphics are nice and it is easy to use for kids.

B008YWY0HK|5|We have been mostly appalled by the Disney Princess phenomenon and all the entitled little mean girls it has engendered over the last twenty years.  (Anyone who thinks Ariel is a model for how young women should behave needs their head examined.)  So it was refreshing to find a Disney movie in which the lead female DOESN'T think that sacrificing all to chase after marriage to a handsome man is the best thing ever.  Merida is passionate, talented, opinionated, bold (and, yes, &#34;brave&#34;), and absolutely willing to stand up for her right to determine her own fate and not have it dictated by tradition.  She's the Disney princess that doesn't want to marry anyone yet.  It's one of the few recent Disney movies we don't mind letting our daughters watch.

B005IQZB14|5|I enjoyed \\"Wild\\" very much, mainly because I saw the author's interview with Oprah the morning before I bought the book. At times, it was not a feel good book cause I would never have done some of the things the author did but I never walked in her shoes either so how do I really know that? I certainly wouldn't have had the guts to be alone in the wild like that at night especially..I really admire her courage & it was really an interesting read..I am glad the journey proved healing to her & she has a wonderful life now..Marie Hendrix

B00003JRCQ|5|This is Austen's best romance in my opinion and the movie adaptation is wonderful!  One of my very favorites.  Really can't believe anyone would prefer the more recent adaptation which was not at all at the same level of quality acting and writing.  This movie is quiet and full of repressed emotions.  The lead actors do an amazing job with the feelings of regret, resentment, and longing.  It is all very true to life.
B000JMKTLO|5|Gillian Flynn has a way with writing characters that are sick, twisted, demented and wickedly EVIL. This book is full of them. I loved it!
B0063IH60K|5|this app is great minus the add at the start of each game. Just the normal fun way to pass time.
B008EEZ64Y|5|I first read this book when i was 10 years old and I really liked it i read it again the following year and knew that it was my top favorite<br />for 7 years I couldnt find my favorit book untill i finally found it on the kindle store and I just had to have it. I have just finished reading it and once again it was amazing. The GIVER is just a GREAT book.
1878424319|5|I bought this book, as it was recommended by a good friend, plus I enjoy a practical 'personal development' book every so often.  What I noticed immediately was the author's writing style - it is simple and easy to follow.  Aside from it being a quick read, the knowledge contained within is truly transformational.  Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this book will make you question all of your beliefs and the origin which they came from.  It will make you reassess every decision you ever made and will give you insight into just why your life is the way it is.  At least once you'll have that A-HA! moment and realize what you need to do next.  Bottom line...buy the book.  You won't regret it.
B007ZRZF8I|5|I love this game well worth my last dollar wish their was a sequel. though you still need to try it controls work very well it also has multiplier
B00DQC2FPM|5|enough said :)
B00CNQ7HAU|4|For some reason I couldn't get into the book at the beginning. So I put the book down for a couple of days and then started where I left off.<br />The story ended up building the suspense when leading to the different plots throughout the entire book.  None of the characters were flat and at times I had the sense of sitting in the smoke filed rooms with them, or sitting at the coffee shop listening to their gossip.<br />If you like mystery and drama, then you will like this book.
B00L9B7IKE|3|Took about 2/3 of the book for the pace and intrigue to get started.
B00KW274SM|5|Really fun thriller which will keep you guessing!
B0014BY72Q|5|I loved the original movie and gave this one away as a present.<br />No complaints so far and Sis would complain if it were bad.
B00EDX76PW|4|While not as good as the first one, the special effects were outstanding and the storyline was interesting to follow
B005LAJ16I|5|Homeland season 1 is an outstanding drama series.  But it is not for everyone.  The show is very dark and adult themed.  This is definitely not a show for the whole family.  But if you don't mind that, then you will probably find it to be an excellent show.  The drama is intense in the extreme and the acting is outstanding.  Claire Danes gives an incredible and very complex performance as Carrie Mathison, a barely stable CIA operative who is obsessed with a US Marine and former POW named Nicholas Brody, who she believes has been turned by al-Qaeda.  The show is worth watching for Daines' performance alone but there is much more here to like.  Damian Lewis is very good in the role of Brody.  Mandy Patinkin is simply riveting as Carrie's CIA mentor and Morena Baccarin is quite good as Brody's wife. The tension builds all throughout the first season as Carrie tries to convince her bosses at the CIA that Brody is not the war hero that everyone believes he is and is in fact an al-Qaeda sleeper.  I highly recommend this series for those who don't mind a dark and adult themed show.
B0072GPQNG|5|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!  I WISH THE COVER NAMED THE HORSE WHO PLAYED JOEY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!!!
B00KA7JIII|5|I encountered no bugs, and enjoyed working the puzzles with my 5-year old.<br />He was frustrated occasionally, but with a hint or two caught on to the necessary thinking.
B00T74HTY0|5|Loved it, I've  always wanted to live in Japan and this was an awesome way to get an inside look into their lives. The story about how he didn't get her anything for white day literally made me laugh out loud.
B000B0WO0I|1|I was browsing through my local record store hoping to spend some Christmas cash, and I came accross this cd. I was so excited because my wife and I absolutely loved their last album, \\"Home\\". <br /> <br />So I picked it up right away (without listening to it)and noticed it had \\"simplified\\" or slightly stripped versions of several of their hits. Right away, I thought it would have the vintage vibe of the previous album. I took it home and popped it in the stereo, and I was HORRIFIED. The new versions of Red's older material were overproduced with new instrumentation, and the arrangements were NOT listener friendly. I went through every track on the cd and was completely dissappointed. I've always been a fan of Simply Red, but this was clearly packaged to make a few quick bucks. What a shame.....
B011KKCQH8|3|A self absorbed computer based millionaire is intrigued by what you can do with AI and picks a really smart computer coder to come to a retreat in the Canadian Rockies to see if the AI he has built can pass for human. The technology involved in depicting the AIs machine parts in the midst of their humanity come across seamlessly; the intellectually lacking script tries to impress with cliches and lots of shallow mythological references like &#34;the meaning of Pollock&#34;  Allan Turing and The Ghost in the Machine, etc., but with no real understanding of what they are about. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) would have fit better in a role in Sons of Anarchy, lacking in nuance and talking too loudly, a common trait among Hollywood types. You know he doesn't have the smarts for the role. Alicia Vikander and Domnall Gleeson do a credible job, and there are moments where the film travels through a space where you don't know what is real, that elevates the film. The best moment is at the end where they show the shadows of people walking and you don't know which dimension they are in.. Its not going to be the Space Odyssey but may become a cult moving partially because the girls are all tall and skinny..and naked.

B000N4SHOE|5|I am one of those people who normally does not leave a review.  But I can't help myself....I loved this movie! All characters were cast perfectly...excellent acting. Exciting, romantic, emotional & uplifting.  This is one I will watch over and over.
0316776963|5|Although I will say right away that Sedaris's humor is probably not for everyone, if you like his brand of sarcasm, this is the book for you. &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; had me and my husband snorting with laughter as we tried to tell each other our favorite lines from the chapter. And Sedaris's stint as an inept writing instructor will be appreciated by anyone who has sat through a writing workshop and wondered about the person teaching it. Wonderful, hilarious, intelligent. Can't wait to read his other stuff.
B00A8ECU24|5|very fun! my daughter enjoys this game very much and plays it all the time. she loves earning new characters.

0316666343|4|When I picked up The Lovely Bones I thought it an odd title but after reading the jacket cover I thought I would give it a try.  I am glad I did.  Alice Sebold tells a wonderful story with humor and agony.  I found myself shedding a few tears along with a chuckle every now and then.  I could not put this book down and finsihed in one day.  I see great things ahead for Ms. Sebold based on this book.  If you want to lose yourself in a story that shows the dark side of Earth as well as the hope of heaven then I would recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5|This app is amazing. I couldn't stop playing it. It is my favorite game and I love how you can make and destroy things. You can even build your own house!
B000SSPL0I|5|The music on these 3 CDs is just incredible!  I really enjoy listening to Miss Renata Tebaldi and Mr. Del Monaco sing together.  It is mind-boggling the talent of these two great singers.  I highly recommend this set!
B00CAJMGDI|5|Best music, the only downside is that they aren't the music videos. Which is your prompt to go to youtube.com and enjoy them!
0060900075|4|Huxley's now classic book which gave inspiration to the rock group, is curious in that you are reading the explorations of one mans mind on mescaline. However, I cant say I found it the most exciting book I have  ever read. This book certainly has its place in ones philosophy library,  perhaps psychology as well. Popular with those who like to experiement with  mind drugs as well.
B0002PUH2Y|5|This album is filled with powerful songs. Bebe's eclectic approach keeps it fresh and interesting.

B00DVKOYBM|5|The game is so fun to play! It is very addicting and can get annoying but is fun get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0080K3G4O|4|I'll keep this short. The only real flaw is that it's a bit anecdotal at times. Overall, I see this book as an explanation of purpose for emotions and affects we typically associate with ONLY negativity. All emotions and bad moments in our lives have purpose -just like the good ones.
B000WTNCYA|5|I own all of Melody's albums, singles, bonus tracks and hard to find guest recordings. I prefer Melody's first two albums, Some Lessons: The Bedroom Sessions, and this album, Worrisome Heart. Her subsequent albums  took off in another direction...I suspect influenced by a new producer. I so wish Melody would return to instrumentation of her original material.
B00L9B7IKE|4|While is wasn't quite as good as Gone Girl, it was a dark and twisted thriller that captivated me from the first page. Great pool/beach reading for the summer!
B00RGQ4674|5|5 stars...To wonderful for words!
B000002OX7|5|This is possibly the best straight-up rock album of the seventies, possibly only second to physical graffitti, and of all time for that matter. I don't care what age you are if you truly appreciate rock music (not limp bizkit papa roach stuff) then this will be one of the best cd's you own.  Won't Get Fooled Again, Behind Blue Eyes, and Baba O'Riley are classics that have stood the test of time and all the other songs like Bargain and Naked Eye are awesome too.
B00BHHIWQO|1|Ok for kids I guess.....I'm not one.  Graphics ok and will still order games.  Win some lose some as they say.  thanks
B00000G3PA|5|I have seen over 500 movies, and this movie is in my top ten greatest movies of all time.  This movie is JAM PACKED with action and exciting moments.  Just following along is EXHILARATING!  And the cast... THE CAST!!  You have Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Billy Bob Thornton, and William Fichtner.  Does it get any better than that?  I have seen this movie over and over and still love it.  You may shed a tear over it, so keep the Kleenex handy.  If you are an action movie fan, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie belongs in your collection.

B00KLP752A|5|Snowpiercer has actually been doing the rounds outside the United States since the 1st of August 2013, and was already a hit before it landed here. For good reason too, and if I were in charge of handing out awards, I would immediately without a second thought hand over trophies to Kyung-pyo Hong (cinematography), Joon-ho Bong (direction) and the absolutely amazing Tilda Swinton.<br /><br />The 딼echanics of having a single train house the human race aside, Snowpiercer is a distillation of the human condition. A metaphor if you will, simplified with its separate components exaggerated to tell a story about class structure, and the deluded notion that the human race is predictable, and as such controllable.<br /><br />The story centers around an uprising lead by a man called Curtis (Chris Evans), and a quest to reach the front of the train. Along the way, as they break through to each new compartment, new environments and mysteries unfold. Snowpiercer is inventive, and violent at times, but always entertaining and certainly one of the more unique films to hit theaters in the last two years.

B0007N1AI6|5|Heavy metal is, without a doubt, the most constricting and conservative form of rock.  Bands have come and gone faster than some of their breakneck tempos.  Some tried to stretch the boundaries and found that metal fans do not like radical departures from their original sound.  Others were merely poseurs whose hearts were not in the music, ala a jillion hair bands from the mid-1980's.  Which brings us to Judas Priest.<br /><br />  One of the first bands to fly the metal flag high, Priest broke into the States gradually, and finally broke big with \\"British Steel\\", a fine slab of punishing riffs and Rob Halford's trademark soaring, growling, snarling and near-operatic vocals, often within the same verse!<br /><br />  When backed by the conjoined guitar twins K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, it was a combination that proved lethal, especially in the heyday of \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and the follow-up \\"Defenders Of The Faith\\".  A slip in the formula came afterwards, followed by a return to roots on the \\"Painkiller\\" album that featured Scott Travis on drums.  His double kick style propelled the band into overdrive only to see Halford quit shortly afterward.<br /><br />  After a couple of solo projects from Halford, including the great \\"Resurrection\\" CD, and Judas Priest's offerings with new vocalist Tim Owens, the first being \\"Jugulator\\", an uneven and poorly focused album, and the much better \\"Demolition\\", which did not do well, either, rumors began to circulate that Halford was coming back to his former band.<br /><br />  Halford did rejoin with his mates and the chemistry has brewed a successful potion again.  \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" is a metal masterpiece, rich in the Priest tradition, meaning thunderous riffs, Halford's great vocals (he is metal's best singer, no contest) and a production that pins you to the wall.<br /><br />  From the opener \\"Judas Is Rising\\" to the opus that closes the CD, \\"Loch Ness\\", we hear a band that despite middle age clearly loves their music and, most importantly, believes in it.  Wherein lies the secret to Judas Priest's longevity.  Like other classic hard rock and metal bands like AC/DC, Iron Maiden and Deep Purple, Priest knows its strengths and stays comfortably embedded in its twin assault guitars, defiance-laden vocals and musicianship that can only be achieved through many years of working together.<br /><br />  Even rock publications that normally treat metal with disdain are giving \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" good reviews.  It's damn hard to argue with perfection.y loves their music and, most importantly, believes in it.   Wherein lies the secret to Judas Priest's longevity.

B001XUW26Q|5|Are you kidd'n me!!!?? I have been living under a flipp'n rock!  How the flip come I never heard of this!?  This is just too frick'n bitch!  This is the real thing.  The real war out there in the new millennium.  This piece of art does'nt pull any punches.  This has got to be the way people are living and dying out there.  Nobody could make this kind of s... stuff up.  This is exciting!  I'm sorry to make so small of so many people's pain and suffering.  Its just that this flick is just so well done.  Crowe and Dicaprio are just both so good, then putting them together is just out of the house!  Its not just that it goes so fast, it goes fast in such a perfectly slow way underneath that you don't miss anything.  That's good for an old s.. like me when I'm tight on vodka on a Saturday night all by myself.  Rent this thing, buy this thing, it will not disappoint.  Unless of course you don't know exactly what the US government is really doing to protect you from terrorism.  Otherwise you might just defect to the jihad.

B005LAIGW8|5|Marvel Comics' demonic biker returns in this thrilling sequel. This time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) finds himself the reluctant guardian of a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan)--who also happens to be the devil's son. If Johnny uses the power of Ghost Rider to keep Danny from being used as part of his father's plot to rule the world, he may be able to rid himself of his flame-headed alter ego once and for all. Great Movie and the price is right. Not a waste of time.

B000O8OTNC|4|The Smith's Pocket Pal is something I had been wanting to try for a while. Wal-Mart and Academy(local sports chain) are always sold out of this item. I purchased the Pocket Pal at the same time I bought another knife. After trying this sharpener on six knives I realize that for me the best results were found when using it on higher quality knives. I have a few cheap knives that were fairly dull. After using this on them their sharpness was only marginally improved. However, when I used this in my Ka-Bar and my SOG Flash II daily carry knife, I found that their edges were brought back to life. Both knives were cutting again like champs. The SOG knife has a partially serrated blade so the conical diamond file provided on the Smith's Pocket Pal was very useful for that.    As for ease of use, I found that this was much easier to handle with smaller knives. With longer and thicker blades the Pocket Pal was hard to hold onto given the small amount of space you have to grab onto it with. There is just enough space for your thumb and index finger. That being said, use this with dry hands on a hard flat surface. Shorter and thinner blades were much easier to sharpen.    The Pocket Pal seems to be built rather well. It seems durable enough to last a few years with heavy use. Given that it was less than $10 I say that this is a bargain. I say every knife owner should give this a try. It doesn't replace my Spyderco sharpener however this goes places my Spyderco cannot. It's perfect for camping and hunting. Because of it's size I was able to throw it into my EDC bag without it adding any noticeable weight or taking up much space at all.

B000HT3PPG|5|When Maureen O'Hara, the top-billed star of 1947's \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\", proudly proclaims all three 'remakes' of the story were flops, it may sound a bit conceited...but she is absolutely right, the original IS the best...and THIS is the edition that is a MUST for your collection!<br /><br />Based on a story by Valentine Davies (who wondered how the real Santa Claus would react to the commercialization of Christmas), with an Oscar-winning screenplay by director George Seaton, the film is a triumph of perfect casting, perfect timing, and a sentimentality and humor that post-War America desperately needed. Contrary to general opinion, 20th Century Fox did not treat it as a 'minor' film (studio head Darryl F. Zanuck loved the story), but location shooting (at the first Macy's parade since the war began, as well as inside the store, during the Christmas 'rush') would push the budget to the limit.<br /><br />O'Hara (unhappily yanked from a long-awaited return to her Ireland home), and popular Fox leading man John Payne were cast in the leads, but the real 'stars' of the film are Oscar-winning 71-year-old Edmund Gwenn (who is absolutely perfect as 'Kris Kringle', and convinced everyone on the project that he really WAS Santa Claus), and 8-year-old Natalie Wood (the most gifted of the post-War child stars), who brings young Susan brilliantly to life. Their scenes together are so sweet and irresistable that the film positively glows!<br /><br />While elements of the story are 'dated' (the competition between Macy's and Gimbel's, the Postal information, etc.), it simply gives the 1947 version a 'timeless' quality that the 1994 version lacked...and in not attempting to incorporate 'magic' into the story (as the Attenborough production uncomfortably does), it actually seems MORE magical!<br /><br />Several supporting players should be singled out; Thelma Ritter (in her screen debut), is wonderful as a frazzled mom; Gene Lockhart (the judge) and William (\\"I Love Lucy\\") Frawley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn. The entire cast is superb!<br /><br />This edition offers both a B&W AND 'colorized' version of the film, each featuring a warm commentary by O'Hara (taped at the 86-year-old actress' home, in Ireland), two documentaries (including scenes from the Thomas Mitchell, Sebastian Cabot, and Richard Attenborough versions), the bizarre trailer for the film, the complete 1955 TV production starring Mitchell, and a sentimental history of the parade.<br /><br />While the film was, indeed, originally released in the summer of 1947 (to maximize profits), it is a bona fide Christmas 'Classic', and should be an essential part of your holiday collection!wley (as the judge's campaign manager) are hilarious together; and Porter Hall, as the hiss able 'psychologist', Sawyer, is a perfect foil for Gwenn.

B0000072VM|5|As you probably know, PFM is an Italian progressive rock band. This is their second album. The sound quality on the CD is excellent. It is 35 minutes long.<br />I don't think this is as good as their first album, Storia di un Minuto. It is a little bit more bombastic and pretenious. Overblown excesses by groups like Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer are what killed off progressive rock. This ablum suffers a tiny bit from that on songs like Generale and Il Banchetto. Some of these songs can get tedious on repeated listenings. But, it is a minor complaint and this album comes close to 5 stars.<br />The lyrics to this album are in Italian. There is a reworked version of this album with English lyrics called Photos of Ghosts. Pete Sinfield (who wrote much of the early King Crimson lyrics) supplied the lyrics. No one in PFM had much English speaking ability and the English lyrics are sung phonetically. The lyrics are meaningless and take away from beauty of the album. It is better to get this Italian version. Photos Of Ghosts does have one extra track, Celebration, which is an English verion of E'Festa from the first album.<br />PFM was a completely different band in concert. Instead of playing mellow, progressive rock, they were a hard core, jamming band. Many of thier live albums are excellent. I would reccmmend the 4 CD set, Gil Anni Live 1970 to 1981. If you can't find that, get Live in USA (also called Cook).
0307383415|3|This is a solid memoir that is very well written for a politician working without a ghost writer.  I think the eloquence and overall quality have been exaggerated by his political admirers, but it does contain honest insights into the memories of a man who aspires to great power.  I would not call it easy to read.  The ambivalence and conflicts Mr. Obama has struggled with throughout his early life about his family and racial identity are obvious on every page.  Personally, I was uncomfortable reading this and ultimately found the book profoundly depressing (hence 3 stars instead of 4).        I find it hard to reconcile the self-portrait in this book with the candidate of \\"Hope\\" filling the pages of today's papers.  In fairness, it was written many years ago, so that projecting his current state of mind from this early book is not appropriate.  Unfortunately,  \\"Audacity of Hope\\" is a much more political book by comparison and I did not find it very revealing.       If you are curious to see something of the man behind the speeches, I would recommend this book unreservedly.
B00BZBQ4GW|5|This is a great movie for the family that we watch every year!
B00DAXYNEI|5|Awesome show. Kevin Spacey is the best! I can't wait for season 2. I love the way you can watch the whole season at your own pace.
B00BAXFECK|2|The Pulitzer Prize?  Really? Way too long and incredibly tedious. I am so relieved to finally be done with it.
B009JZTOG8|5|I give Once Upon a Time Season 2 a five star rating because I am a big fan of the series, I think it is awesome and that the directors and producers are geniuses. I love the show, and think that it is one of the most interesting in terms of story telling and flow in terms of tv shows that are on today. It takes the tales we all know and love and puts them together for a wild ride. I give season 2 five stars.
B007DIQAXI|4|I don't know why they are pressing double records for most releases these days when all the songs could fit on one. I don't want to have to switch the record every 3 songs! I actually deters me from listening to these records. RECORD COMPANIES, QUIT PRESSING DOUBLE RECORDS JUST TO PAD YOUR POCKETS!!! YOU AREN'T FOOLING ANYONE!!!
B000J10EQU|5|This is a FUN movie with awesome picture and sound.  With a HDTV and surround sound, we may never go to the movies again.  It is a little graphic toward the end when Superman is getting beat up by Luther and his thugs...but I think ok for my 10 year-old...
1401937519|5|Anita's message resonated with me.  I love her descriptions of her NDE.  I already gave this book to a friend and purchased another for my brother's birthday.  He is cancer free for 5 years; never had a treatment.  He changed his way of looking of life, similar to how Anita describes how life is supposed to be.  I used to think life was something to be endured; now I know it's to be enjoyed!
1476735115|1|This book had received 3855 reviews at the time I am writing this. That is a colossal number. Having sampled some of them, it seems rather obvious that the author, who published through Amazon's Kindle self publishing, has received strong support from Amazon in the rating of this book. Such tactics are a disservice to Amazon's customers and are certain to affect the perceived partiality of the review feature of products offered on the website.<br /><br />Since I posted this review, I have received four attacks including one from the author. None of them bore any relevance whatsoever to my statement above.

B006GLLXXK|4|After watching the first three episodes of season one my wife and I would rate this program as being somewhere between &#34;it's okay&#34; to &#34;I like it.&#34;  We went with &#34;I like it&#34; because we're currently not watching anything else that's all that exciting, and this show has been pretty good, so far.

If you have the courage to read this book and be open minded, I guarantee it will strengthen your marriage and bring an intimacy back into your relationship with your spouse that you may have lost or never had.  I thought I knew how to communicate with my spouse, but this book showed me that communication is more than just verbal.  Read it...I can't rave enough about it!
B0091V6TJ0|5|I ran out of things to listen to by Can, so began visiting YouTube for obscure recordings by them and stumbled upon thee Lost Tapes. I bought the set immediately. I've been enjoying Disk #1 for a couple months, especially &#34;are you waiting for the streetcar&#34;. I'm moving slowly through the set, savoring all the raw spontaneity of the tunes. These guys are inspirational.

B000BHHVPO|5|This DVD set has wonderful songs that many of us have known for years, as well as great contemporary music that is upbeat and fun. I loved putting the DVDs on and just having it as background as I did other things. I'm very glad I purchased this set.

B007EECSFA|5|Second Kate Morton book I have read.  This story leaves one thinking about those we love and what we may not know about them.  Nicely woven story line
B00KGEQYNW|4|I'm enjoying this game.  Picked it up as a FAotD, and the lack of permissions inspired me to install immediately.  The lack of directions wasn't a big deal to me, the game isn't exactly rocket science.<br /><br />I like the simplicity.  I like the fact that it is a complex but simple logic puzzle.  I love the lack of timers or retry limits.<br /><br />So far, the only thing I haven't liked is the Rate Us box that pops up every few levels.  If that is the worst I can say, it must be a decent puzzle game.
B004LQI0HE|4|This was a &#34;moody&#34; film, beautiful to watch, with good performances from the lead actors. I read the book, and so was interested in seeing the translation into film. I think the film did justice to the core of the story, which was pretty unusual. (It would ruin the story to tell the &#34;secret&#34; of the boarding school in a review.)  The book could have done with less detail, the movie with more.
B004H1V5RU|4|Bought this for my son (11) after he played with one at Barnes and Noble. He really enjoyed trying to figure out the maze. But after giving it to him for Christmas it has sat in his closet for the past year. Not sure it is the balls fault for not being entertaining enough for him or just his preference to video games.
0887431453|5|Great way to keep preschool learning ongoing over the summer.
031623480X|4|What an upheaval to most of what I held true about proper nutrition!  This book was recommended to me by a friend and I must confess, having retired from the retail food industry after over 30 years, I was appalled and ashamed that I had participated so &#34;naively&#34; in conventional thinking about food and its affects on our brain.  If I had only known then what I know now...<br />It is clear that the book was written by a physician and I often found myself a little overwhelmed with the deeply detailed analysis of various foods and chemicals.  (I was inclined to accept the author's credentials and expertise so there were many times that the point had been made, yet seemingly endless explanation continued.)  I did find the recommended tests and the website resources which accompanied the book to be quite helpful.  There was also a list of recommended supplements and a great variety of recipes that the reader can utilize to apply the information.  I have made the commitment to change what and how I eat for my own health and quality of life as a result of reading this book.  I encourage you to read it and apply as best you can, too!
B004GUSG4M|4|I'd been wanting to order this book for my Kindle for a while, but the price never dropped. Finally, I said to heck with it & was so glad I did! The story is well written & engrossing. The author does an excellent job of playing at the truth without giving away too much. Through the book, I kept thinking, \\"Does he...?\\" But, then the author would throw in a clever little twist to keep me guessing up to the end. A fun, quick read.
B00AZMFJYA|5|This one's very well done and one for the fans!

0743298020|5|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a delicious old-fashioned-with-a-new-twist kind of read. From its rich-toned  cover to its windswept vistas, this book is full of the old England we've read and loved. It's chalked full of secrets, obsessions and suprises at every turn. Wow. This debut novel delivers with its sumptous scenes and rivoting plot.<br /><br />Vida Winter, the famous and reclusive writer contacts bookish biographer, Margaret Lea to write the true account of her life after years of offering nothing but unreliable versions--and this is only the beginning. The two women have more in common than they realize--lies, truths, half-truths, twists and turns and switchbacks occur at a heartpounding pace. On a more philosophical level, it asks the questions: What are the truths about our own lives? What stories have we told to create and recreate ourselves?<br /><br />This Bronte, Austin, Du Maurier concoction is impossible to put down. The weekend's coming up and I sugguest you buy this book, put on a pot of tea, find your fuzzy house slippers and read The Thirteenth Tale far into the night.<br /><br />~Carol D. O'Dell, author of Mothering Mother, Kunati Publishing, April 2007.

B008LZHA3G|5|Of the accumulated reviews of this new Bob Dylan album its difficult to find one that has not referenced that \\"Tempest\\" shares its name with Shakespeare's final play. With the great man into his 70's is the master musician leaving yet another tell tale sign? Let us exhort that this is not the case for on this form you can only plead that long may he run. Whatever Dylan's intentions the title is accurately appropriate since \\" Tempest\\" is a dark and often stormy affair notably containing a 14 minute and 45 verses long title song dedicated to the sinking of the Titanic where Dylan throws in some of his most vivid images, torrid tales and pale sorrow not least a Captain who \\"In the dark illumination, he remembered bygone years/He read the Book of Revelation, filled his cup with tears\\". It is wordplay of the highest order and actually names check Leonard DiCaprio to bring it all up to date.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Duqunese Whistle\\" sounding like a track from a honky tonk jukebox until Dylan's voice kicks in and commences an excellent railroad song which skips along at a fair old pace as the stations pass by. The lovely country lament \\"Soon after midnight\\" follows, so effortless and yet so right. The mood changes quickly for the near eight minute long \\"Narrow Way\\" a barbed electric guitar piece which rocks hard enough to performed in garages across the US. Dylan's last proper studio album was \\"Together through life\\" in 2009 (let us forget his yuletide abomination in that same year) and that suffered from serious sagging in the mid section (a problem for all men of a certain age). \\"Tempest\\" is closer to \\"Modern times\\" in this respect since every song fits and it's a solid set not least the excellent trilogy of songs from four to six. This comprises Dylan at his most reflective in the superb \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" where the master lyricist concludes that \\"we cried on that cold and frosty morn/we cried because our souls were torn so much for tears/so much for these long and wasted years\\". He is at his snarling best in the belligerent \\"Pay in blood\\" where his excellent road band provide great support. He also appears to tip a nod to Gillian Welch in \\"Scarlet town\\" which appears a distant cousin of the song on \\"The Harrow and Harvest\\". It's a great Dylan performance with that old gravelly voice sounding as vital as ever and strong to boot. Next up Muddy Waters \\"Mannish Boy\\" provides the backdrop to \\"Early Roman Kings\\" with a great David Hidalgo cantina-blues accordion providing the necessary earthy accompaniment. Dylan has always specialised in songs where vengeance is the unifying theme and \\"Tin Angel\\" couldn't be further removed from the Joni Mitchell love song of the same name sounding more like a Nick Cave murder ballad with its gory bloodshot finale. Having mentioned the albums huge \\"Titanic\\" narrative leaves us finally to touch on \\"Roll on John\\" a seven minute tribute to John Lennon starting with his assassination, referencing the Quarrymen, Hamburg and various sources of Beatles legend not least part of the lyric of \\"A day in the life\\". At this point it is this reviewers least favourite song on \\"Tempest\\" since if it wasn't composed by any one other than Dylan it could sound somewhat gauche and overtly sentimental. It is certainly does not match Paul Simon's \\"The Late great Johnny Ace\\" but it's a tender recognition of an old friend and proves that Dylan can be sweet hearted and nostalgic when needed.<br /><br />This is Dylan's 35th studio album and stands as a firm equal to \\"Modern Times\\" as his best album of the 21st century. We have no right to expect albums this good after all this time and the fact that he continues to confound, puzzle and challenge should be cause for rejoicing. 2012 looks like being the year of the veteran with great albums by Dr John, Paul Buchanan, Bill Fay and Leonard Cohen. And yet amongst all this excellence \\"Tempest\\" confirms Dylan's rightful pole position as the greatest storyteller in rock historyck history

After reading Dan Senor's book I have a better understanding, and in fact, reflect upon why my country may have lost some of its innovative genius, in my lifetime.<br /><br />The pattern of life, education, national service, leadership requirements and opportunities in the Start Up Nation not only enable creativity and enterprise, but almost require it!

B000URDEB0|5|Some people will argue that Nightwish has gone soft by bringing in someone like Anette and changing their style of music. I think it's just different, but still sounds good and very well put together. The only thing that is missing are some of their newer songs. Give it time to get use to the new Nightwish and I'm sure you'll love it. I'm both a Tarja fan and an Anette fan.
B001GZ6QBU|5|The Dark Knight is a crime drama better than Batman Begins. It is gripping and holds you to the very end. Cristian Bale is a very good actor who plays Batman in this movie and the Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is mesmarizing. I liked the battle going on for the city and Batman's quest to rid the city of corruption. Joker was humanizing he portrayed the darkside in all of us. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be entertained and left wanting more. Thank you.

B003J27WFW|5|I DVRed this off Palladia a little while ago and finally got to watch it last night. Not really sure what to say about it other than it is an amazing, amazing, amazing film that surpassed my expectations. The old footage the filmmakers have dug up on these guys is by itself enough for me to give the film my highest recommmendation. One particularly notable example is footage of guitarist Alex Lifeson at a very young age (18? 19?) debating the pros and cons of a career as a professional musician with his parents at the dinnner table. Where did they get this? More interesting, who was sitting at Lifeson's family's dinner table documenting this (in color and sound, no less), way before Rush was famous? This is but one of the many joys to be had for the Rush fan in BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE, which I will not ennumerate, but instead simply say that if you have been a fan of this band at any point in your life, you need to see this film. It's hard to predict these things with any kind of certainty, but I'm pretty sure that in time this film will be listed with the likes of [[ASIN:B001NHZ2KM The Kids Are Alright (Deluxe Edition)]] and LET IT BE as one of the all-time great rock documentaries.
B000J103PC|3|What \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" lacks in substance and originality, it makes up for in scenery.  Lots of sexy, haute couture clothing fills the screen (and, if you listen to the commentary, you'll be treated to a piece by piece deconstruction of it all), and they are usually adorned by equally sexy actors and actresses, most of whom are required to do little more than wink and show off a sultry moue.<br /><br />The story, about fish-out-of-water Andy Sachs (a cute-as-a-button Anne Hathaway) trying to make it as second assistant to the domineering ice queen Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), opts for easy outs every step of the way.  You have the Ugly Duckling Transformation (which isn't nearly as remarkable as this movie wants us to believe it is; Hathaway's good looks are tousled, not hidden, at the start of the film), the Crisis of Conscience (which is also hard to swallow; Andy \\"betrays\\" one of the most unlikeable characters in the film), and the Call to Reality (which includes one of the most over-used lines in film history: \\"You've become one of them.\\").<br /><br />Does Andy become one of \\"them\\" (\\"Them,\\" in this case, being overly critical, weight-obssessed fashionistas)?  No.  Not really.  Unless you call wearing better clothing and working a lot more becoming one of \\"them.\\"  It's hard to imagine a different outcome, when you are working as the assistant to the Editor-In-Chief of one of the world's largest fashion magazines.  Andy's friends (and, specifically, her milquetoast-dull boyfriend, Nate) exist like props to propel the barely-there moral agenda.  They are supposed to show us Andy's earthy, Good Time roots (they playfully toss her phone around when she gets a call from Miranda; what fun!), but they are also there to let the audience know when Andy has Gone Too Far (according to this movie, getting an unsolicited kiss on the cheek is enough to convict someone of infidelity).<br /><br />That's dismissable.  What this movie is really about is Streep's icy Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.  Streep restrains herself admirably, turning what could've been a one-note character into an entire symphony.  She is also aided by the excellent work of Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of Priestly's helmsmen.<br /><br />Both of these characters (and the actors who give them life) take what could easily have been a horribly trite film and turn it into something that is, if not remarkable, then at least interesting.  The film tries hard to get us to see how Andy has sold out, how she has co-opted her dreams in order to Fit In, but all any intelligent viewer will see is just how fun and exciting Andy's world is once she DOES fit in (and she does it so well).  It's an odd little movie that makes the uncompromising boss seem like the most sympathetic character, while the Family And Friends seem like little more than whiny obstacles, but that doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />Of course, the ending is to be expected, and it feels as if it's been lifted straight out of a Hallmark card, but the real ending is, like most of the movie, all Streep's.  If Andy is the angel fallen from grace, seduced by a well-dressed demon, then this movie is all about sympathy for the devil.  And even if you can't swallow that, you still get to look at a lot of pretty shoes.y Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.

B006LSZECO|5|I expected decent intrigue..sort of.<br />I expected it would be good because of the friend who recommended it; she's no pushover.<br />However, the intrigue was much more well done than I expected and the writing was wonderful.  The dialogue included glib and ironic comments and a bit of eclectic knowledge to get it.( That made reading the e version fun because the ability to look things up is at my fingertips.)<br />There is a good chance I will read another book written by Gillian Flynn....yep....I think so
B0036S4B6M|5|NOT a historic fan of prison-themed books, I highly recommend this book. Overall, this book is excellently written and provides really interesting insight regarding the perspectives and mentalities among the women and their experiences in prison as well as the prison operations (albeit seemingly without rhyme or reason at times). I found that the raunchiness in the show is not at all a reflection of the book...there is no physical or sexual abuse discussions or descriptions (for those, including myself, who are sensitive to that sort of thing). Some mental intimidation or bullied-ness or the intention of  malice is described, but specific activity about such there is not. This book is one of support and togetherness and at times leaves the reader shaking his/her head about the minimal effort for ready-to-release women into society. I think this is a wonderful book and really should serve as a lesson to all of us to double-consider with whom we associate.
B00688628M|5|Thoroughly enjoyed it, would recommend it to anyone who enjoys war movies<br />Only con I would have is the volume is too low when the veterans are speaking the beginning
B0052UYJDC|3|The book contains a lot of practical suggestions for how to reduce clutter, and the author's reminder to ask of every item whether you love or need it is a good one. However, despite the title, I didn't realize just _how_ minimalist Jay's approach is. She assumes that all of her readers share her delight in bare surfaces and near-empty rooms. My working library contains hundreds of books, and not only would most of them be almost impossible to replace, but being surrounded by them also gives me a sense of comfort and abundance. I know other people who get the same feeling from their makeup palette, or shoe collection, or full pantry. Jay's only response to the emotional comfort many of us get from our stuff is to tell us to stop being so attached and lecture us about how we are destroying the planet and exploiting the downtrodden. Between the author's radical minimalism and a hoarder's extreme fear of deprivation lies a happy medium in which, I suspect, most of us would prefer to live - we don't want stacks of paperwork or junk everywhere, but we do want enough tableware to entertain guests, enough craft supplies for hobbies we really do expect to get back to when our current project is finished, etc. For me, Julie Morgenstern's \\"Organizing from the Inside Out\\" was a better fit for the kind of less-extreme decluttering that I was looking for.

B0007KTBIU|5|Happy With Purchase And Grand-daughter loves the dvd<br /><br />Was very happy with my purchases, and would recommend to friends and family.
068987474X|5|This is the perfect book for any woman who asks the question \\"Why?\\" after a breakup. If you wonder what happened...what went wrong...will he ever come back...this is the book for you.  It is brutally honest and sometimes funny. A must have for any woman who has been left by her man.
1564029654|5|we have gotten this book from the library several times.  my 4 and 2 year olds love this book, as does their mom.  my 4 year old is particularly sensitive and cries at a lot of movies and books, but this one has never upset her (referring to a reviewer that found the book disturbing).  on the contrary, i think the book reassures the young reader that mommy does always come back, just like she said she would. <br />the illustrations are beautiful and you just want to hug those little owls, especially little Bill. <br />thumbs up!
B005ZOBNOI|5|It would be impossible to read this book without becoming engrossed in the lives of the two main characters.  It's a moving and captivating book.

B000025XKM|5|This was Nick Drake's masterpiece. It did not have the lush orchestration of his two previous releases, and it's delivery by tape to Island records adds poignancy. It only runs for 25 minutes plus. <br /> <br />I first heard Drake here in the UK when at school in the late seventies and was amazed - very few people were listening to this style of music amongst the tide of punk and new wave. <br /> <br />Nick probably wrote this whilst living in isolation in London, and Parasite is a song that many can relate to, but the glorious 'To the morning' reminds us to his rural upbringing, and if you know the wonderful Engish countryside this is one of the greatest tributes. <br /> <br />Often in music greatness emerges after death (Bach and Schubert for example), and Nick Drake was/is one of the few greats in contemporary music. <br /> <br />This CD also reflects a yearning for more spiritual things and finding direction (such as 'road' and 'which will'). Yes, it's sparse, but has an amazing honesty and a sense of what might have been. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00QW8TYWO|5|Its fun and better than flappy bird and trigger
B004856SQ8|4|I can say that the cameos of certain A-Team members was delightful. The film flowed nicely, the humor was great, and Bradley Cooper epitomized face. Liam Neeson delivered a wonderful performance as Hannibal. While no one can replace the original actors, the casting performed for this movie was outstanding.
B00GQQ75QO|5|Great movie can't wait to watch the next
B007VUA7VO|5|I like this app. I like how you can choose at what percentage of power remaining you want to be notified.

B00006IR5S|5|John Williams 2nd movie only strengthens his foresight into perhaps how the music should progress throughout the Harry Potter franchise.
0316017922|5|How can you not be intrigued by a book with a chapter entitled, \\"Rice Paddies and Math Tests\\"?! Curious about how Gladwell connects the dots? Then you should definitely give this book a read. Think cultural factors including linguistics and the work ethic necessary to be a successful rice farmer in SE Asia. This is a very engaging and entertaining book pointing out the often overlooked circumstances (familial, cultural, geographic, etc.) that likely play a significant role in the extraordinary success of individuals. Gladwell punctuates his theories using antedotes from popular culture that we are all familiar with including Mozart, The Beatles, Bill Gates, and other just as successful but perhaps less known individuals.
B00IRISI42|5|Outstanding.
B00CL68QVQ|4|This movie shows Bi-Polar disorder in a good light.  It is a great love story between two odd people that fit together well with all their oddities.
B00APJLEGA|5|I love Adam Sandler and he does not disappoint in this movie.  This is a funny, clever wonderfully animated film.  My only criticism is that the story line was a little old, a child raised by the father who tries too hard to protect her from the outside world and she rebels (think Finding Nemo).  The comedy aspects of the movie, especially the naive ways of &#34;Johnnystein&#34; make up for the overall plot.<br />Another issue, connectivity to Amazon's streaming video...still working on that.
B00AREIAI8|5|Ok if you love horses than this is the greatest thing that you will ever before see.Especially if you love competition.
