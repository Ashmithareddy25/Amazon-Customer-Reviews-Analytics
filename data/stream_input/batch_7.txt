B003TSEEDY|5|One word-amazing. It was an emotional look into the life of a damaged young boy. Absolutely incredible. A must read.
B00BLCHYKU|5|This is my favorite new series. Good characters and lots of action! Can't wait for the next season to come
B0006GAO5Y|4|Excellent product, very pleased.  Overnight shipping was a bit shakey.  The item was delivered to the wrong house.  It seems that some of the drivers do not pay attention to detail, such as Road and Drive.  If I wasn't watching the online shipping status I would still be waiting for the item to arrive.
B0058VW36U|5|Deffinetly an app worth paying for. I at first wasn't interested because the ap image led me to believe it would be a very childish game but I was deffinetly proven otherwise. The quality of the game is excellent, the update has happened for all devices, and it's a very well rounded game. I do reccomene a younger crowd considering the simplicity of the game.
B0089LOG02|5|I liked the going back and forth from present to past and found it well researched and expressed. It would be a good read for young adults on. Also for anyone searching for their true identity.

B008673ZAQ|5|If you enjoyed \\"Bared to You\\", you may have been anticipating this next book, like me.  I'm about half way through and am enjoying it just as much as the first.
B007FTZDN8|4|This is a great app full of inspirational speeches. The only thing I dislike about it is it sometimes it pauses. On the other hand, it is a great app that you should try out.

B001VLXNLU|4|I'm a big fan of fantasy, especially anything to do with vampires, but even so I'm usually skeptical about picking up a new series. The cover for this book caught my eye immediately. The title, while intriguing, didn't do a lot to tell me about the story. Zoey is a character every girl can relate to right off the bat. She has problems with school, boys, and family just like every other teenager. She's witty and sarcastic in a lovable way. The first page was a real gripper. The line about seeing the dead kid at her locker is something that you can't forget. Not only is Zoey dealing with all of the regular teenage issues life throws at her, she learns she's been marked to attend a vampire school. She'll either become a full-fledged vampire in the end, or die.<br /><br />Mother and daughter writers PC and Kristin Cast are brilliant in this coming-of-age story that spotlights the trials that young adults face and the friendships and bonds that form from experiencing something new. Fans of authors such as Stephenie Meyer, Richelle Mead, LJ Smith, and Ellen Schrieber will fall in love with Zoey and her friends at the House of Night school.
B00LU0XO3O|5|Bought this for my 67 year old dad to back up his slides on his own free time. With a 16GB SD card he can do this all on his own with the LCD screen but he really likes the attachment to his TV. I couldn't be happier with this purchase! Great product and good price!
B002VPE1WK|5|In 1972 I went looking for a backpack that could hold my camera gear. There wasn't such a thing. I resorted to putting a traditional shoulder camera bag into a backpack.  This product is simply the best camera bag I've ever owned.  It doesn't shout: &#34;there's camera gear in here.&#34; It's configurable for just about any application. Built strong. Easy to get on and off.
B00KH0VSOU|5|Teenage daughter loves it....can't say much more than that, she's one of those &#34;fan girls&#34; :) So its a hit!
B0002XDODU|3|Since the appearance of their last release, \\"Mutter\\", Rammstein has decided to take a different direction musically. Rammstein had made themselves known by their bone crunching catchy riffs and almost danceable metal sound. They might feel that their music is maturing, but most of the time, as is the case with most metal bands that make it big, the cost of that \\"maturity\\" is a new sound that does not please the fan base. If maturity is not the right term to use to describe this drastic change in their musical style, then the only other way to describe it is that this latest release is an attempt to make music for the masses. To even attempt this considering this is Rammstein we're talking about here is quite foolish, because not only will people say that they \\"sold out\\", but that most of these songs do not stand out as \\"musical genius\\" in any sense of the word. <br /> <br />The only songs worth noting are \\"Reise Reise\\", \\"Dalai Lama\\", \\"Ohne Dich\\". <br /> <br />I am a die hard Rammstein fan, and I am not disappointed with this new release. However, if Rammstein had started out making music that sounded like this, then I am sorry to say that I would have never become a fan in the first place. <br /> <br />From me, this CD gets a rating from of 3 out of 5. Better luck next time, I hope!
B00G3HSF7O|2|The good<br />------------<br /><br />Elysium was a visually great movie, with a few decent action scenes.<br /><br />The rest<br />-----------<br /><br />I find it HILARIOUS to be getting this sort of simplistic crap about how \\"the rich\\" should open their homes and wealth to \\"everyone\\" from a bunch of millionaires who live in houses with high walls and private security surrounding them. The message would have a LITTLE credibility if Damon & Co. were opening their mansions to the homeless every night.<br /><br />Essentially, this movie has the economic and political understanding of a two year old. The economics shown simply would not, could not every operate. Well, actually it could - under a communist dictatorship. There is no other set of circumstances that would allow a wealthy elite to continue to pull in wealth from people as poor and jobless as the citizens were.<br /><br />Oh, and the silliness with those \\"med beds\\". As portrayed int he movie, these things can cure anything, cost literally nothing to run, consume no raw materials limiting their use and are fully automated. Yet, we are to believe, \\"the rich\\" keep them entirely to themselves because... well, I gather Damon and friends just figure that \\"the rich\\" are evil. Not the Hollywood rich, just all the rest of them.<br /><br />So, they keep the \\"med beds\\" to themselves, as a result disease on earth is rampant and Elysium is subject to intense hatred and nearly constant terrorist attacks. Does that make sense? nope. No, what would make sense in a world where such a fairy tale technology existed would be for the Elysium folks to simply cure anyone who wants it - for about $100 a shot. They would make HUGE amounts of money, be seen as benefactors and have a thriving, productive Earthly population to both create the goods they need (almost no one on Elysium works, apparently) and it would stop all the terrorism.<br /><br />But no no says Damon & Co. The rich are far too evil for that.<br /><br />It's all a fairly 2 dimensions, Occupy Wall Street view of the world... the view of a Hollywood leftist spending oh so much time wringing his hands about the evils of the 1% while he flies off in his private jet to have another fundraiser for people he makes damn sure he never has to spend much time with.<br /><br />Watch it for the effects if you want, they are good - but recognize the rest of it for the idiocy it is.airly 2 dimensions, Occupy Wall Street view of the world... the view of a Hollywood leftist spending oh so much time wringing his hands about the evils of the 1% while he flies off in his private jet to have another fundraiser for people he makes damn sure he never has to spend much time with.<br /><br />Watch it for the effects if you want, they are good - but recognize the rest of it for the idiocy it is.
B002RSDW80|4|I bought this movie a while ago for her birthday and she has watched it several times over the last year.  I am not usually into the movies that she watches, but this movie was an interesting story (based on a true story) about two different times (when Julia was younger and modern day Julie) and Julie's commitment to cook her way through Julia Child's cook book.

B00U6A89RU|4|Cassidy's prose is as mysterious as her storyline. Every sentence seems to be halfway to poetry, & every character seems to have more than one story hidden inside them. &#34;Curious Reality&#34; shines in a way that few other books do. It makes you think even as it entertains.
B000W1V5VU|2|I enjoyed Ocean's Twelve.  I skipped Ocean's Eleven.  I heard good things about Ocean's Thirteen, so I downloaded it.<br /><br />Ocean's Thirteen is supposed to be better than Twelve; the characters are emotionally invested in the plot (as opposed to the first movie, where they were apparently needed the money, I guess) because this time they're out for revenge. Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) invests in some properties only to have it forcibly taken from him in a move of Trumpian proportions by the nefarious Willie Bank (Al Pacino).  Poor Tishkoff suffers...a stroke? A broken heart?  Some kind of nondescript medical condition that leaves him bed-ridden? Our boys are loaded with cash, so it's just a matter of humiliating Bank, returning the property to Tishkoff, and making a quick buck in the process.<br /><br />The fact that they have to ally with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is supposed to make the movie even more hilarious.  But it doesn't matter, because our heroes take it in stride.  In fact, there's never a moment in the film when we actually feel like things might go sour.<br /><br />There's a lot of problems with Ocean's Thirteen, not the least of which is the superhero status of our Justice League of Swinging Hip Guys.  There's too many of them. They're all really rich at this point.  And it's hard to conceivably rouse them into action, even if one of their buddies got hurt.  Or to put it another way, when Superman can punch you through a wall with his fist, does he really get that upset if you cut him off in traffic?  Does he even drive in traffic?<br /><br />Bank is supposed to be a really mean guy, but Pacino barely gets to tear up the scenery because it's crowded with a dozen other actors.  So he's only sorta mean.  He's also really, really paranoid, which makes breaking into his place a challenge.  He invests in all kinds of technological defenses, including an artificial intelligence that uses face recognition to spot cheats.  Bank is truly a wonder of the modern age.<br /><br />Opposing this technological villain are our heroes, who kick it old school.  And by old school, I mean they buy a gigantic drilling machine to cause an earthquake, thereby temporarily shutting down the computer security system and giving the team time to get in and get out.<br /><br />This is pretty much where the movie broke down for me.  They bought a giant drill to get revenge on this guy?  Seriously?  When you have that much money, why not buy a big satellite laser and just nuke the guy from orbit?<br /><br />There are other nearly interesting plots, like the one in which Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) decides he's up to the challenge of seducing Bank's right hand woman, Abigail Sponder (the SMOKING hot Ellen Barkin). And what do we get?  Caldwell ends up using some ridiculous technological doodad to knock her off her heels, which seems suspiciously similar to a date-rape drug.  If the movie was trying to make a statement about outwitting your opponent vs. using technology, it failed.  If it was trying to imitate the Rat Pack, I don't think drugging the hot chick (no matter how old she is) is how you do it.  And given that Barkin smolders on-screen, the fact that there's no actual pressing of flesh really makes the whole film into one big practical joke.  If Ocean's Thirteen were trying to emulate the old style heist movies, you'd better believe Caldwell would be keeping the \\"cougar\\" busy. The greater sin is that this leaves Barkin with nothing to do than look stupid.  She barely has any lines!<br /><br />There's other stuff that happens, some of it meant to be funny that's not so funny.  Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle, still using that ridiculous accent) gets to ham it up, which is a high point in the movie.  He writes touching letters to poor old Tishkoff to bring him out of his funk, but we're robbed of any sentimental feeling because we never find out what's in the letters.  And for reasons that don't make any sense to me, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are barely in the movie.  It's almost as if the guys thought that their egos got in the way of the second film, so instead they'd make it all not about them in the third film and that would make it better.<br /><br />It doesn't.  Ocean's Thirteen is a photocopy of a photocopy.  It feels like it's written by guys who didn't bother to see the original Ocean's Eleven and instead wanted to put in jokes about funny noses and \\"cougars.\\"  The allure of the Rat Pack is that they were men playing a boy's game.  Ocean's Thirteen feels like boys playing a man's game.he guys thought that their egos got in the way of the second film, so instead they'd make it all not about them in the third film and that would make it better.

B0010VD7EO|4|you wouldn't think MGMT would be my kinda thing: i'm more into guitar driven rock like  old Cheap Trick and Aerosmith.  but Oracular Spectacular is just too damn catchy to deny.  \\"Time to Pretend\\" is one of the best songs of the decade: complete with a \\"Baba O'Reilly\\"  beat, and \\"Pieces of What\\" sounds like Johnny Thunders.  how cool is that?
B00H71PBQ8|5|Absolutely love this show!
B00003CWOL|5|Dogma is smart, funny, deep, incisive, witty, and sharp--in other words,  it's a Kevin Smith movie.  It isn't his funniest (that's Mallrats), nor  does it boast the best dialogue of a Smith movie (that's Clerks, though not  by much) but it does have the best plot, the best acting, and the most to  say of any Kevin Smith movie.  Only American Beauty was better in my book  last year.  If you like Kevin Smith, you should own this movie.
B006ID6NDQ|5|Tells an in depth story about the Nazis and those who didn't go along with what was happening but did not have much that could be done about it except to survive and suffer the fear of discovery.  Dealing with the fear and trying to survive at all costs of pride and humanity.  From what she said they all knew pretty much what was happening but maybe to the extent things were being carried out.  A very revealing story and one I'm glad to have read.
1857152743|4|After seeing the play \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" performed at my school, I decided to get the novel (or novella) and read the original.  Needless to say I enjoyed the story greatly and find it to be one of the better stories in this collection.    The other stories, however, are good.  Not great when compared to \\"Brodie\\" but they could stand well on their own.  For the price of this collection you would be doing your collection justice since Sparks is one of the best Contemporary writers and \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" is a captivating and original story.      Also, the introduction by Frank Kermode is a nice preface to each of the stories which contextualizes them well in Spark's life and to the time in which the stories were written.
B000W4RFHK|5|I was blown away by this book. Leaps and bounds better than On The Road, Kerouac's prose in this book is masterful, and I eagerly await reading Big Sur.

B0063IH60K|4|Love this version, my only complaint is the ads between each hand, usually they aren't too bad but once in a while you get ones that have to go through the whole 30 seconds. The game itself is great though!
B008ALAHA4|4|Apples quantum leap forward in plug technology left me with several power adapters equipped with the simpler, less sophisticated Magsafe plugs.  Throwing caution to the wind, I've chosen to use converters to bridge the gap between old and new.<br /><br />Picked up a couple of MagCozys ([[ASIN:B00ERVP4R2 B00ERVP4R2]] to keep my converters in place.
B000OLGCHA|5|Unlike so many others, I find this is an excellent score, more than serving its purpose in fitting seamlessly with the film itself. I have been listening to it since I bought it, more than a dozen times already and find it highly enjoyable. I cannot understand people not hearing any magic in it, though, yes, for the most part it is darker and more mature. So was the story. I am thrilled that Yates and Hooper will continue. At this point I feel there needs to be some continuity in the final films, which will tend to play out like one long story.     Another Story absolutely captures the feel I got when I read the opening of OotP. The element of the oppressive heat and the lonely, mournful piano theme presenting the isolation that Harry is experiencing is painfully gorgeous and wistful and sets the tone for the entire film to perfection. I'm tempted to say it is my favorite track, but the more I listen the more \\"favorite tracks\\" I am beginning to have.    Another fine track would be Possession. Hooper, in my opinion, absolutely made this scene what it was on top of the fine acting and direction. I could not for the life of me, when reading it, figure out how they could accomplish this scene without it being too stereotypical of some cheesy horror film. Possession provides just the right underlying momentum, presenting Harry's pain, fear, his grief, and a climbing ultimate release as he realizes what he does have and what is more important than pain or death. I've seen the film 3 times, and each time I become misty, which is pretty unusual for me in any film. Listening to the track, I realize how much of that scene is painted right into the sound.    The extended syncopated section of the bass and cellos in Death of Sirius is another favorite spot. It is so reminiscent to me of a heart beating erratically in fright. It's urgent, pulsating, and totally conveys the drive of the scene.    I found elements of GoF's themes here that worked wonderfully. GoF was like a breathof fresh air to me after listening to JW's first two scores which were suitable for the children's stories the films portrayed, but little else and the PoA's score, which worked hard, had maybe two interesting tracks, but fell far short of the beauty of the film itself. Hooper continues to use a lush pallet and adds some surprising rhythmic elements I love. His work added an underlying urgency that subtly enhanced the tone of the film.     I will be sorely disappointed if they go back to John Williams to score the last film because he is SO busy that little of his music sounds fresh at all anymore. Kudos to Nicholas Hooper. There isn't a track on this score that I don't enjoy for its texture, mood and function.
B0000025HG|5|\\"Wet\\" (1979) was quite overlooked when it was first released &amp; only praised for the Super-Hit Disco \\"No More Tears/ Enough Is Enough.\\" This Album includes some of the most beautiful melodies and lyrical songs Streisand ever performed. \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\" &amp; \\"After the Rain\\" are two beautiful tracks that Streisand gives her best self. The album is faithful to its title, keeping the \\"Wet\\" theme, which was a great idea. The C. Bayer Sager track \\"Niagara\\" is a winner, while \\"Splish Splash\\" is fun &amp; quite tongue- in -cheek. The album concludes with \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" a breathtaking pop track that will surely send tingles down your spine! Recommended.
B00005QXDD|4|This CD comes from a talanted duo that debatedly waste their talents making goofy songs.  With that out of the way, this CD is HILARIOUS!  While sometimes innapropriate, this CD fires on all cylinders by delivering funny lyrics and goofy music while being backed by one of the most talented drummers in the world, Dave Grohl.  If you like music sort of like the Bloodhound Gang only with a rock edge, pick this album up!
B00821OX98|4|Have really enjoyed the time spent watching this series. It keeps me interested though sometimes it seems a bit far-fetched. It is a war series with aliens as the bad guys but holds true to most war themes.
B00821OX98|3|OK show
B0083P1QUM|2|The title and jacket description are a misnomer. This book has almost nothing to do with a missing paleontologist or a bone bed in Alberta Canada and focuses almost exclusively on the discovery of a body in Boston Harbor. I was seriously disappointed by this, as I chose the audiobook based on the description and then felt like I had to listen to the whole thing during my road trip despite it's deviation from it's advertisement.<br /><br />The choice of voiceover for the audiobook was unfortunate because the woman who reads it tends to up-talk, or speak the last few words of each sentence in a higher pitch than the rest of the sentence. Despite her age and otherwise good pacing, it felt like I was being read to by a valley-girl. It was very annoying, especially after 10h.<br /><br />This was my first foray into the Scarpetta storyline and I found myself annoyed and frustrated because although Scarpetta says she built her team and values them, she constantly complains about every aspect of them and wishes they would &#34;shut up.&#34; She &#34;lets them continue spinning their theories, even though they are wrong.&#34; I found myself annoyed by how arrogant and dismissive she is of everyone. When she is multiple hours late for court and gets taken to task first by the judge and then by a very good defense attorney, she hypothesizes the judge and defense attorney must be sleeping together or else she wouldn't get this treatment- not that her behavior (showing up severely late to court and wasting everyone's time) might cause the judge to not rush to her aid.<br /><br />Fans of the series will no doubt love the book because it follows a character they already have a relationship with, but those unfamiliar with the series will be put off by the poorly composed storyline, the reliance on minutia, and the general attitude of the main character who is lucky that anyone wants to work with her for more than 30 min.<br /><br />The audiobook is a no-go under any circumstances because the up-talking is beyond physically painful to listen to for extended periods of time.ecause the up-talking is beyond physically painful to listen to for extended periods of time.
B0019O6IWU|5|This book changed the entire way I relate to the world and other people.  It's amazing what compassion can accomplish. Approaching every human situation from the standpoint of feelings which point to needs, changes everything.  Highly recommend this book.
B00304LF0W|5|All movie reviews are, ultimately, a person's opinion. I've seen the reviews of this movie and find something in all of them to agree with.  It's easy to do so, depending on what you are expecting from this viewing experience.  This movie is a \\"self-shot documentary\\" of a couple's experience with supernatural events that rapidly escalate in severity.  Obviously, there are going to be moments of \\"For heaven's sakes! How can you be *that* dumb?!\\"  On the other hand, there are often moments of unexpected shocks.  To believe that a true-life couple would lug a camera around or have one running at all times to capture this stretches credulity to the breaking point.  That said, if you allow that and other expected snags to pass by, this can be a rewarding viewing experience.  You never see the \\"monster\\", a point that I find makes this movie MUCH more scarey than it would have been if they'd floated by all sorts of CG phantasms.  They leave it up to your imagination to craft the monster, to shiver over its decision to escalate its attentions, to almost see it in the darkness just beyond the lighted doorway.  The actors are believable for the most part(in my opinion).  I give this movie a high rating, not for its technical excellence or superlative story line, nor even the actors.  I give it marks for allowing me, the viewer, to make it as scarey as my imagination is capable.  And, as anyone who's ever jumped at a sudden inexplicable noise in the dead of night knows--our imaginations are very very capable!
B000JLSLZQ|5|Great movie, definitely a must see. One of the few classics left, and in great quality now! A must see if you have a love for the classics.
B004J4WKUQ|5|One of the best books I've read in a very long time. I couldn't put it down. The characters, setting, ideas, it's all so real.
B007FG9LIE|4|I read this book because it was featured on Amazon for free. I couldn't stop reading it, and it had me guessing during the whole reading. Definitely a mysterious science fiction thriller. If you loved Lost, The Village and Resident Evil, you'll enjoy this one.
B004JZBGWI|5|I ordered this for the refrigerator (comes with handy magnets for this purpose) and it more than fits the bill.  I use it to jot quick reminders and an added bonus is my husband has started leaving endearing notes on it for me...can't beat that!  It is easy to use, sensitive to touch and easy to erase (have to push the button and feel it depress).  If you are looking for a quick and easy tool that saves the hunt for paper/pen, this is perfect.  It would not be useful to save information, but it does save paper for quick reminders.
B000000WFF|5|The Spice Girls, those glitter-besotted pottymouth disciples of mayhem, continued their history-making bubblegum crusade against the decadent relics of grunge on this, the second of two albums that would kick in a new pop era of bouncy, glowing optimism and divinely frivolous tunes.  But none who came after could reach the fever-pitch exhilaration they managed on song after song.  \\"Spiceworld\\" takes off on a euphoric trip through the archetypal pop formats-- Motown, disco, even showtunes--to create a global groove for the dancing masses of teens, tweens, kids and adults who all fell under the spell of these fiercely independent pop princesses.  \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" swirls with carnaval percussion and a wriggling, jungle-inspired beat; its an Oasis-like wall of sound built out of Latin rhythms and the patented Spice hooks.  \\"Stop\\" is their inspired Supremes homage, dizzying in its joyous recreation of that classic sound.  \\"Too Much\\" is the first brooding ballad, more jazzy than \\"2 Become One\\" but similarly lush and lovestruck-- just listen and consider how very, very far everyone else on the scene is from creating slow tunes with such mastery.  \\"Saturday Night Divas\\" slinks along with a dazzlingly orchestrated syncopation.  The floor-stomping \\"Never Give Up On the Good Times\\" represents a pinnacle of energy, even on this disc of flushed-cheek dance tunes-- this disco anthem shakes and shimmys in  ecstatic release, the explosion of positve energy that is the Spice Girls' trademark.  And on and on and on.  \\"Move Over\\" punkishly extends the Pepsi-commercial theme into a song on Girl Power revolution.  \\"Do It\\" lays down the feminist 'rules are for fools' theme, with a swooningly delicious bridge sweeter than melted ice cream (thanks especially to Emma on that one).  \\"Denying\\" is a sultrier sort of R&B tune, somewhat akin to the \\"Forever\\" album's material with its smoldering lover's anger.  On the second ballad, \\"Viva Forever\\", the Spice Girls express a shockingly Neo-Platonic conception of life (\\"Live forever, for the moment/ Ever searching, for the one\\") in dreamy lyrics that express fervent yearning,  over a swelling orchestral arrangement with touches of Spanish flavor.  Yes, and then there's the closing number, \\"Lady is a Vamp\\" where the Spice Girls salute their culture-heroes in a rousing, comic piece of burlesque.  Whether as solo artists or a group, we'll certainly continue to enjoy the show.  \\"Spiceworld\\", in each and every song, is a monument in pop history, an artifact as enduring as \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or the \\"Immaculate Collection\\".  As writers and performers, the Spice Girls achieved new heights of energetic bliss, and \\"Spiceworld\\" remains a must for all who would know how great pop can be.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Yea it's cool and stuff
B005LAIIS0|1|This movie just plain stunk . Everything they did just was wrong and never would have happened. Very very disappointing. Unbelievable and then the ending was the kicker which made it 10 x worse everyone in the theater even went you have got to be kidding me. The biggest waste of time and money.

B003SPCYP8|5|This was seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am so glad I watched it. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B000KX0IOK|5|Ryan Gosling definitely deserves the recognition that he has gotten for this role. He is such a promising young actor and the directors have done a great job in creating an environment in which he explores the character. Shareeka Epps is also a good new find - it will be exciting to see what she does next.  Movie buffs and actors alike should definitley check this one out - one of the best simple indie films in awhile.  The ending is also refreshing as it gives the audience just enough information to infer the outcome of these characters without spelling anything out.  Good storytelling.
B002361MLA|5|Amazing....if everybody realised the liberation of living in the present moment, imagine how different a place the world would be. It's not easy an easy task to do which is why a lot of people don't persevere, but one that is absolutely life changing.
B009XIXVU6|3|Not even close to the Kite Runner as far as story line, deep impact, beautiful writing.  This story was so disjointed that I finally didn't really care what happened to the characters.  I really wouldn't recommend it.
B009GEAPYW|4|I'm a big fan of Adma West's version of batman but the gritty... dark batman is wonderful.  All of them- and seeing bruce get old and how he still feels like he wants to brawl is how you expect batman to end up
B00EUIO8Y2|5|Can't stop watching it from beginning to end. Her passion, her emotion and her love for the stage and her fans is overwhelming
B00F2362IE|5|What can I say I love being a turtle!
B005721W9O|5|Even though this movie is old, it is still funny.  Tim Allen is still a great comedic actor!  The film is also appropriate for the family.
B0012EM5D8|4|This was a good movie.  A lot of the jokes will go over the childrens heads but it does have a good story line and it also shows children that when you do something how it can effect everyone else.  My 4 year old daughter enjoyed it.

B00DR0PDNE|4|Super fast delivery!  Not very clear setup instructions.  I was expecting more of a wireless HDMI affect but this is limited.  Maybe I should do more research and troubleshooting.
B0064MPXFA|5|What's most impressive about this show is the quality of the writing. In a context where nudity, obscenity and violence that HBO or Showtime or even one of the cable channels is not an option, this show cranks out interesting and believable episodes which have a weekly payoff while continuing an ongoing story. The lead character is a &#34;good&#34; person but not a goody two shoes and is played in a way by Juliana Marguiles that creates sympathy for her without making her be Saint Alicia. If you need the &#34;reality&#34; that swearing and sex and violent death lend to HBO series, you will probably be bored and frustrated but if you appreciate compelling story telling and character development within the conventions of network television, this one's worth watching. It won't take long for you to be hooked.
B00ENNA62W|5|The movie and package is exactly what I expected. This combo is a great value for what you receive. Excelsior!.
B0064NTZJO|5|why is the guy in the movie wearing a scorpion in the back of hes jacket?<br /><br />the movie is about a methaphor of a scorpion<br /><br />it goes like this<br />One day a scorpion is hanging around the side of a stream. A frog happens by on his way across the stream. The scorpion cannot swim so he stops the frog and asks if he can climb on his back for a ride across the water.<br /><br />\\"Do you think I am crazy?\\" The frog says. \\"If I let you on my back, you'll certainly sting me and I'll sink in the water and die.\\"<br /><br />The scorpion replies, \\"hey just think about it for a second, I can't swim. If I sting you, then you'll die and I'll sink and die too.\\"<br /><br />The frog thinks for a second and decides that makes sense, so he proceeds to give the scorpion a ride across the stream.<br /><br />About half way across the stream, the scorpion stings the frog. The frog screams \\"What are you doing? Why did you sting me? Now I am going to drown and die and you are going to sink and die too.\\"<br /><br />The scorpion says \\"because is my Nature.\\"
B00F87ZUYG|5|I loved it.  Wish it went all year long.  It takes me into a place that makes me forget the day I had and actually appreciate what I have.  Just think if it was real.  Wow spooky.
B001NLKXK2|5|Well written story from the perspective of the person with early onset dementia. It touches on not only implications for the patient but also includes family dynamics.
B005K0HDGE|5|11/22/63 has all the weirdness I've come to expect Mr. King to deliver with a poignancy that startled me. The \\"what if\\" question that begins this story is one I am sure has occupied many readers and anyone who ever watched LOST-the TV series.<br /><br />If you could go back and change time would you? If you did what would happen?<br />Is the changing of time worth your life? A life? How many ripples will you create?<br /><br />Many readers and writers alike are fascinated with Time Travel as a subject. Since H.G. Wells gave us The Time Machine, readers have been treated to different variations on this theme.<br /><br />I enjoy King, but this one knocked my socks off, because of some of the things that happen along the way and how attached I grew to the characters. There is a very powerful love story woven into the fabric of time that reminded me of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander in its tenderness mixed with brutal realities. As usual once I began reading, laundry was forgotten in the dryer. (it should have been folded). Dinner was burned, (I should have remembered it was cooking), and while having many channels to choose from, TV held no interest for me. I just wanted to get back to the book.<br /><br />Neither Mr. King, nor Amazon needs my review for this book to succeed, but I'm writing it because I think King has a wickedly fantastic imagination and remains one of the best storytellers of our time.<br /><br />I am giving the book 5 stars because I loved it!
B008CLI3TE|3|Having heard a lot about this series I was poised to purchase the first season on blu ray and enjoy it. Yet, in looking at the price of 51.00 for the blu ray only version and the cost of 47.00 for the blu ray/ dvd/ hd download combination... dont think I will be getting it.

B009LMTDL0|5|With 3 girls, very young girls, this book has inspired me to support a community where women have a choice to either stay at home or work outside the home achieving their potential without being judged by their gender.
0452295548|5|The power behind this book is a massive stroke. Without that there is no book, even though this woman is a brain scientist. This massive stroke taught this woman how the brain works from first hand experience. She is not teaching what she learned to get her doctorate in brain science. It is great to read to learn about how the brain works, what the purpose of life is and dealing with severe adversity. The child know what the purpose of life is but the person forgets and gets confused.    It is strange that after this woman has this stroke that she becomes Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2008. If people are not thrilled with how she describes things, keep in mind that she is trying to describe something that is indescribable. Whenever that happens many people can complain with how it is expressed but the person is doing the best they can to talk about something that is beyond words. The following book (Stumbling on Happiness) describes the many imperfections of how the mind and memory works from many studies that were done. You cannot criticize a person for flaws in the human mind. A major reason for these flaws is that the human brain has limited memory like a computer. So it needs to do different things or tricks to conserve memory that can make it inaccurate.

B005SAJJHM|5|This is a Great season of The Big Bang Theory.  I will watch it over and over again.  Thank you
B004TI5N38|4|This was a good story, but many times I thought I was reading a Lee Child novel. Even the physical description and military background of John Puller was so much like Lee Child's Jack Reacher.
B00NX73VL2|5|Good DVD.<br />BK
0345350499|5|This novel is one of my favorites and I absolutely love it. In my Humanities class, we're assigned to read Malory's &quot;Le Morte D' Arthur&quot; for the Feudalism portion. But I wasn't interested and the nice teacher said that I can go along with Mists of Avalon after I explained what a great job Bradley did with it. I mean, with a book like this, I'm simply not interested in reading any other rendition of the Arthur legends. I'm not interested in that by itself and Bradley's book is so much more than that. The rest of the reviews here pretty much sums up everything else that I could say. Thank you Bradley for bringing life and personality to the characters of the Round Table and finally Avalon.
B000YMFCS4|3|Schmaltzy and mostly satisfying romance with the characters seen in flashbacks as youngsters and in a more recent time period as elderly adults. Beautiful sets, costumes and actors. Pretty unbelievable storyline, but who needs realism in a romantic fairytale?
B0014VQGX4|5|Grandson loved it
B009UX2YAC|5|It the best game ever I'm 12 I played when I was 10 I love it then I play temple run and temple 2 but they never got updated so I went back to subway surfers I love it from Holloween- Miami
B002QEXN2K|5|as with the last record. john shows he is a old soul in a young man. battle studies is a great cd.
B0031RS7MW|3|Found the story very repetitive and kept expecting more to come of the storyline but it never did.  Came close to putting the book down without finishing it but kept going in hope that it would improve.  To me, it didn't.
B009UX2YAC|5|I don't like it I love it.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Downton Abbey is a must-see series at our house. The quality of the production makes the characters and the situations come alive.<br />There is very little to criticize about Downton Abbey. We have watched the episodes several times each, and enjoyed them every time.<br />We get frustrated with characters, but that speaks to the compelling scripts and the excellent acting. I love seeing the costumes, buildings<br />and cars of the era, too. We have followed the Crawley family from 1912 up through the late 20's and, of course, we have our favorites. This is a very satisfying series and we will miss it after the 6th season concludes!
B006LSZECO|4|Very good book since I just love mysteries. Well thought out and written. I have already purchased another by this author, Gillian Flynn. I very much like her style of writing.
B000WAGVHE|4|`Hairspray' manages to achieves exactly what it set out to do, be a larger than life, colourful and fun musical movie. This film has a pretty great cast, what with Travolta as a woman, Christopher Walken as a gentle, encouraging dad, pfeiffer as the bitchy station manager, as well as Queen Latifah, Zak Efron and the great Nikki Blonksy as the main character Tracy. This film is full of catchy tunes and great dance routines and although I hate to say it my feet were tapping on more than one occasion. The main story is pretty light hearted (miss hairspray pageant), with a serious theme underneath (racial integration) and manages to mix both well without being too heavy or too cheesy. Everyone plays their roles well and although some songs are better than others, it manages to be a pretty good musical and if you're a fan of the genre this should be right up your street. I'm not a huge fan of musicals and I still found this to be pretty good! This shake and shimmy edition has an extras disc that has a sing-along feature, as well as a menu where you are taught the dance moves from the film. This allows those hardcore fans to dance and sing along each time they watch the film, a good idea even if not for me! Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B007QA3AH2|4|Will watch it again.
B00005AWMF|5|I LOVE THIS.
B00B23O97Y|5|This is a great album.  I love Eric's new recordings more than his older recordings.  My favorite (a song I had never heard before) is Further on Down the Road (not to be confused with Further on Up the Road).  I highly recommend it.  Matthew Becker - Portsmouth, NH
B0007P3582|2|Keep in my mind that no one has ever claimed that 50 was a great lyricist, let alone an average one. Nevertheless he WILL sell, regardless of the quality, and this album proves that point emphatically. I'm not a 50 hater, it's just that he doesn't make good music; if you have any sense you should know that. The fact that 50 is backed by stellar producers, em and dre, and a good marketing department, will always keep 50 on top of the sales charts. <br /> <br />As for \\"The Massacre\\", all you need to know is that for the most part the production is very good but as usual 50's lyrics are anything but good or even adequate. This is pop-rap at it's finest though, and if you're into this sort of thing you may in fact like the album.  <br /> <br />The only true highlight of the album is \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\", where 50 shows a bit of creativity and raps from the point of view of the drug crack. It's a very creative concept; not sure if it was ghostwritten or not. There are also a few incredible beats one the album, particularly \\"Ski Mask Way\\" and \\"I Don't Need Em.\\" 50's lyricism doesn't do much for either though. These 3 are probably the best tracks on the album. The rest is either mysoginistic garbage or tired, played out to death cash, money and guns stuff. One particularly terrible track is \\"Get in My Car.\\" <br /> <br />Bottom line this album pretty much blows aside from the nice production. If you want some real hip hop go purchase a Common album, or Talib Kweli, or Dead Prez or something. <br /> <br />On a side note, 50's former associate The Game dropped a very nice album \\"The Documentary\\" earlier this year. Good production AND lyrics on that one, for the most part.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Interesting story with an unexpected ending.
B00000G3Q4|1|det er den drligste film jeg nogensinde har set.. effekterne er drlige og skuespillet er endda vrre!<BR>lad vr med at se den..
0962477060|5|Ive been playing a long time, and i still buy referance material.Fretboard Logic is great wish I would have seen this when I started.It would have saved alot of frustration and time.At times it can be a little confusing for a beginner,but just read what is confusing you again and you will get it.This book simplifies the guitar much better than anything ive seen yet and it doesnt just use one style it covers them all.well worth the purchase, if your a beginner buy it, itermediate buy it this is a great referance to have around.
B00B99KJR0|5|Awesome little game so far. I am only on the third level, so it may get too hard, in which case I will remove it. Sure wish the makers would wait till level 10 or so before begging for reviews. Many games I love at first, but then delete before level 10. The jury is still out on this one.
B008XBCJ34|5|Eye popping and jaw dropping 3d effects! Hands down..I have watched the Panasonic 3D bluray version, and I know that this is not the same, but most likely this version could be better than the Panasonic's..<br /><br />Watching it is like your part of the movie and it's like the first you've watched it. Jungle scene was really awesome! The plants, ferns, etc was really out of this world and absolutely wonderful! The separation of objects/items/people to the background have great depth that makes you think it's in front of you, and some parts make you feel your in the movie.  Wwwoooaaaahhhh! Every 3d bluray movies should be made like this. I have watched other 3d bluray movies, and the pop-out effects are not as good as this.<br /><br />The end result is a perfect 3d video that truly shows the spirit and emotion of the film.<br /><br />I know this 3d bluray release is very very very late already for a 2009 film, but I'm not gonna comment about that anymore. I'm just saying my experience when I watched this 3d bluray.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Worth every penny!
B000VBJEEG|5|EXCELLANT CONDITION
B00821OX98|4|Just started watching with Amazon Prime. Really like the layout of the website and the control you have over programs. This show is pretty good and I am starting get to know the characters. Probably will watch the entire series.
B008IJTFYW|4|Works well, would like more creative selections but it is worth the trial to see if you would like it.
B00BAXFDLM|5|It's been a long time, since I've finished a book and immediately went back to re-read chunks of it, but that's what happened here.  This is posthuman space opera at its best.  Charming, witty, thrilling and smart.  Despite leaning a bit too heavily on coincidence in a couple of points, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Extra copies have already been purchased as gifts for friends.
B00BSBUZPK|5|We watch this almost every Saturday! The Eagles are a band for everyone & forever. Their discography is impressive and their music will last forever! Watch the making of the band, the ups & downs of the band & listen to hit after hit after hit!
B000001FY9|5|This CD features all of Bob Marley's best known songs.  This is classic stuff.  If you are new to reggae, this is the first album you should get.  Then, if you like it (and I don't see why you wouldn't), you can delve further into the Bob Marley catalogue.
B00456PKG4|5|I saw it on regular TV with commercial awful ! So I rented it. I liked a lot
B009OYSFDM|5|I find this program to be interesting, action filled and all the twists and turns in the script make for an intersting hour to my night!
B00003CXDV|5|This movie is truly brilliant. As a life long Star Trek fan and attendee of sci-fi conventions, the reason this movie is so brilliant is because it's TRUE. From the weary actors having to bear the curse of Eternal Type Casting, the goofiness of devoted fans, the chore or listening to the same fan boy stories and the obnoxious male lead, I never stopped laughing. Alan Rickman is perfect in his role as the frustrated serious actor reduced to wearing an alien head. The casting of the ultimate Sci Fi female icon, Sigourney Weaver, is priceless. She really embraces her inner bimbo and has fun. Tim Allen as a Shatner-esque is a win!
B00178JDCK|5|Amazon delivered it very quickly.My RV600 arrived in a factory fresh box and is working perfectly since I received it last week. Often I have been disappointed with a drop off of treble or introduction of noise, but not with this baby. The Tone control actually adjusts bass and treble in a positive way. Another cool feature is the trails on-off switch. This is nice feature with reverb, because when you when to move on to a dry signal after you clicked off the effect pedal the reverb effect (any of them) continues until the decay is over while you are now playing the dry signal. Metal case? You don't need no stinking metal case. This plastic case is industrial. I would suspect the pedal hinge would break before the case would from heavy jumping on it to turn it on and off. Yes, the LED is way too bright but now I can read my sheet music better. The Space tone was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Really cool sound. And so was the Echo feature, which really acts as a cool adjustable delay sound. I can't judge the battery life since I only use a external power supply.  Over all, a great unit for a the rest of us musicians who want a good effect pedal at an  unbelievable price.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Loved reading the series. 2nd time. Hoping to read series again soon. Didn't have favorite part,each part was so awesome.
B0042AEOG0|5|Fans were nervous Mariah couldn't do it again, but from the first note to the last, the best-selling female singer of all time delivers the goods, both traditional and more \\"festive\\" in true Mariah style. An album that plays seamlessly through with her first Christmas album (I've tried it!), and one you'll enjoy for decades to come!
B00Q4EJVRO|1|Not great. Pretty vulgar. The only good song on the album is Uptown Funk.
B0083ZRAJS|5|This was a very good book! If I were you I would read this! Good book for kids. Totally worth it!!!
B007JRU2UK|3|The Descendants is a successful production. The acting was very good. The pace for the type of story told was reasonable. The emotional journey was engaging. The ending was fair enough. The music track exceptional. I think many people have liked and will like this film.<br /><br />There were several points about the film that made me wonder why the film was received so well. Matt King finds that his comatose wife had been having an affair. He decides to find her lover and invite him to come to the hospital to say good bye to Matt's wife. He goes to great lengths to find him. I'm willing to go along with a character as developed, but this notion defies my reading of the world. I don't think there's more than a man in a thousand who would do this. And there was no reason, no foundation to expect that Matt King would either. Much of the film pivots on this preposterous idea.<br /><br />Second, characters are shown visiting the comatose wife and mother for the purpose of yelling at her about how bad she was as a person. If she could hear what was said, it was utterly cruel to put her through these tirades, her being unable to correct the record or even apologize. It wasn't funny and I couldn't sympathize with the complainants. They went too far, all of them. If she could not hear them, what was the point? They were just having tantrums. Not appealing or entertaining.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />In the end, the wife's lover is discovered and confronted. Matt King invites him to come say good-bye to his wife. The man chooses not to make that visit, but his own wife does. She brings her flowers. Really? Look, with proper development, any character can justifiably be made to do about anything. But this is not the case with this angry, hurt wife. She asks to speak with the comatose woman, which is pretty absurd in itself. She proceeds to \\"forgive\\" her in a tirade that fails to hide her angry resentments. The lady was not portrayed as mentally unstable, quite the opposite, so this scene seems so very, very improbable...and it's cruel, once again.<br /><br />In spite of all this, one feels oddly moved by the movie. The circumstances themselves beg for such a response, wife and mother dying before amends can be made, the finality of death in the bloom of life and such. Emotionality carried the day. So it succeeds despite all these glaring faults. Strange thing.s scene seems so very, very improbable...and it's cruel, once again.<br /><br />In spite of all this, one feels oddly moved by the movie.

B008Y2FRFO|3|Good at first but once you reach a level over 120 it becomes boring because you never run out of coins.  And there no really exciting goals to attain
B00HZ3BGPS|1|poor Tom Clancy, thank goodness he's dead but I'm certain he's turning over in this grave at the stupidity of this movie. The writer has to be too dumb to go out of his house without a minder.  The very first scene is dumb, where Ryan is hurt because he's the only one who doesn't have his seat belt on when their helicopter is shot down, and it just gets worse from there on.  Costner staggers thru the scenes as though he's on drugs, or just knows it's a verrrrrry stupid move. They should pay people to watch this movie.
B00846REIS|5|I loved this book so excited to read the next book in the series!!! One of best books I have read
B009CCBCU4|4|Very imaginative work.  Good character development mixed with romance and adventure. I will look forward to reading the next sequel
052594527X|5|This is the kind of first novel many serious writers ache to produce.  Chevalier effectively takes us away from the hustle and noise of the 21st Century--the omnipresent cell phones, the whirring faxes, the beeping  answering machines--into a world rich in silence and texture.  Practically  from the beginning the reader will find herself unconsciously relaxing as  Chevalier quickly brings 17th Century Delft to life: the silence of  darkened rooms, the crackle from a kitchen fireplace, the muffled sounds of  feet moving swiftly up stone stairs.<br />The heroine, Griet, is an  intelligent 16 year old  who, because of a family tragedy, is ripped from  her poor but closely knit family to work as a maid for artist Johannes  Vermeer's household.  Unlike her own home's rather straightforward traumas  (how to survive now that her father, a tilemaker, has been blinded in an  industrial accident), the superficially quiet Vermeer household seethes  with  jealously, turmoil, intrigue and secrets.  Griet comes as a maid, but  she evolves into a painter's assistant and, ultimately, muse--a  transformation that changes the direction she may otherwise have chosen for  herself.<br />Chevalier brilliantly and persuasively describes the rigor and  tedium required to maintain a 17th Century home; just reading through  Griet's daily workload is enough to make one want to take a nap.  The  divison between server and served, the fine line Griet must walk to please  her insecure new mistress and her perfidious children, make modern  sensibilities bridle.  Life, as John Kennedy liked to observe, is not fair.   And as this book matter of factly points out, it was even less so before  democracy's leavening influence.<br />My biggest regret re Chevalier's book  was that there wasn't more of it.  There didn't need to be, but I was  sorry, even with its bittersweet ending, that the book had come to an end.
0670647500|5|I was inspired to read this book when I heard the Bob Dylan song &quot;Hurricane&quot;.  This amazing book is a moving account of Rubin Carter's life written by Rubin himself while he was in prison.  The stories  of his life in prison and the battles he fought were great. I couldn't put  the book down.  The only problem with this book is that it is out of print  and very hard to track down. It is defintely one of the best books I have  ever read.
B0066W1AZK|4|This is a very good chess app that plays a decent game and looks great on the Kindle Fire. The interface is intuitive and it is easy to select your level of play against the computer or select to play against another person. There are a few minor things that could be improved, like listing the captured pieces and being able to \\"undo\\" your last move when checkmated, but otherwise this is a great version of chess.<br /><br />The app is free and is supported by small unobtrusive ads at the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00BEZTMWW|3|I haven't watched it in 3D yet maybe that will make it more enjoyable this is nothing like the Lord of the Rings. The only thing that I can say positive is the sound that comes through my onkyo Tx-nr 818 was amazing.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Doesn't work with net flix😳 it gets errors and the desktop streaming is choppy and slow.. Roku is better google is a huge company... They could afford to put out a better product..
B0031KC8OC|5|This show/series is not what I expected. I read the reviews how good it was so I took a chance and started to watch the first few episodes. Little did I know, this show became addictive to watch and had to watch 2-4 episodes a night. A must watch show.
6300216268|5|I first saw &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; about a year ago. And I immediately rewound the video and watched it again and again. I own it now and every now and then I just need to see it. I feel the same way about  &quot;Ordinary People.&quot; &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; always finds a  way to give me whatever I'm missing at the time. And after I see it, I  always feel better.
B00A2AHU2E|5|Really good but weird show. Could not predict it.
B00RKOWH8M|5|An absolute classic
B00HTYTQ5A|5|This is a fun show with a nice dynamic between characters. I initially thought it was supposed to be really serious, but it's definitely more fun (but still interesting).
0547884591|5|I just totally love this book. The amount of information surely indicates that there was a lot of time and effort put into it. I also have Tim's two other books that are great. But this one is just so cool to look at with a wealth of information. I also have the kindle versions of all these books. Make no mistake the kindle version won't do this book justice, its great as a quick reference.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying more of the recipes. I tried a couple so far and they were all very tasty and quick to prep. Since I love to cook I appreciate the tips and some of the tools he suggests. How can you not love the Aeropress. It certainly set me free from $5 coffee shop lattes.<br /><br />Anybody who follows Tim knows he isn't an ordinary guy, so don't expect an ordinary book! He goes from making a poached egg to taking apart a deer to preventing fat gain when you binge. There is just so much to discover. It's worth every penny and then some.
0064471837|5|I LOVE this series, almost as much as Harry Potter. This magical, somewhat dark series is in my re-read list. Garth Nix is coming out with a fourth addition to the Old Kingdom trilogy, so start reading Sabriel so you can be ready for it!<br /><br />I always recommend this to my parent friends who are looking for a book for their tween to read next. A bit darker than Harry Potter because of some of the themes (Sabriel is a necromancer, but Abhorsen's are good necromancers) and creatures that stalk Sabriel on her journey to find her father and of self-discovery. On Sabriel's journey to self-sufficiency, she encounters issues of identity, death, loss and trust.
B005J4VV28|5|I received my copy of THE BEATLES CARTOONS, Vol 1 the other day. The packaging was very good. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was very happy with this collection. It is stated that there are \\"some imperfections\\". I found those to be very minor. The overall quality was very good. I was glad I bought this collection as it is a bit of cartoon history for us that grew up watching these cartoons when we were growing up. I hope the quality for the other volumes are just as good. I recommend this collection to other Beatles fans.
B00004ZELJ|5|I love the DVD live in Orlando of BSB!! I like it so much!! Thanks!!
B009FZFONO|5|Edge of your seat storytelling, fascinating characters, and plenty of emotional melodrama take this series way beyond your typical tv show. This season goes deeper and more raw than ever.
B00BKTFABE|5|Love it!<br />Needed a recording of a school performance and it worked great.  Now I have a saved memory of my grandson performing a song in American Sign Language.  Thanks.
B0006IJ5PM|5|You can't fully appreciate what high school football means to a West Texas town unless you go there. The Odessa landscape reminds you of the moon, dry and desolate. The week drags on like purgatory, until Friday nights.  <br /> <br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" realistically captures what day to day life is like where prep football is king, and everything else doesn't matter. High School football is in every pore of every person who lives there. Winning teams are treated like gods, until they lose. Then they're on you like a pack of wild dogs.  <br /> <br />This movie shows what it's like to live and die for the game. You see the unbelievable sacrifice that kids, parents, and coaches put up for this. You may tend to brush this aside as just a phase in teenage boys lives. It's much more than that.  <br /> <br />After the movie, be sure to watch the feature with the real players and coaches of the Permian Panthers. You'll see just how close reality and filmaking have come here. I came away from \\"Friday Night Lights\\" wishing I could have been there. And thanking God I wasn't.

B008478VE8|4|It is a seminal book on one of the most significant theories guiding the study of life. Darwin, together with Wallace, were ahead of their time and realized early on that life is a complex system of trial and error.
B004LWZWBU|5|I bought this movie for a friend as a gift because it is refreshing and funny.  I've already seen it countless times and it never gets old.  This movie has a stellar cast with Owen Wilson, Steve Martin, and Jack Black.  Diane Wiest, Anjelica Huston, and JoBeth Williams also have memorable roles and the movie includes other well known actors and actresses.  This is a great film to relax and watch if you enjoy beautiful scenery, light humor, and a positive message.  The many different species of birds are also a joy to watch including the \\"ruby-throated hummingbird\\" and \\"snowy owl.\\"  A Big recommendation for The Big Year.
B005XOPEOU|1|I have to start by saying that I read a lot of the reviews before I bought.  Much like anything else, they were all over the board.  Of course, differing views are what make us human, so this was no surprise.  I must also say that I am a big Cold Play fan, owning all of their previous albums.  Many of them I have listened to dozens if not hundreds of times.  So I was salivating with antici......pation for this new CD.<br /><br />What others have said is very true.  The advertised \\"something different\\" just isn't there.  Although, I am a music lover, and don't consider Cold Play to be what I call a \\"chameleon\\" band like Guster or The Dandy Warhols (who I also love)--you never know what you will get with a new album of theirs, and that is a signature element of their appeal.  Cold Play not so much.  You buy a Cold Play album expecting sweeping epic orchestral tunes with thought provoking lyrics.<br /><br />And I agree with others that the mixing of these tunes is just god awful.  Sub par at best.  At least Cold Play hasn't jumped on the over modulated voice tracks that most pop songs have these days.  But with as awful as these tracks sound it wouldn't have surprised me if it would have been there.  The addition of Riahanna on Princess Of China doesn't even help in my opinion.  Her voice is pretty much wasted here.<br /><br />The addition of the tune-lets that are under a minute is a recurring Cold Play irritation.  In my opinion,they just break up the rythym of even their better works, and certainly don't improve this one either.<br /><br />I can honestly say that there isn't a stand out \\"love it!!\\" song.  Not even one I like very much.  I'm not sure it will even get listened to again.<br /><br />I have listened to this album in its entirety three times already, once in my car-with a kick ass premium 8 speaker Bose system-which makes listening to Viva La Vida a nearly religious experience.  Even with the great stereo, it still sounds like total garbage. The songs and the production are a one-two punch of embarrassing mediocrity.  I have a feeling this one will get tossed in the back seat.  Destined to be found by the detail guys when I trade in my car someday.  Along with my Fred Schneider solo album and my Palm Pilot.  Two other things that despite the hype, proved to be less than useful in my life.<br /><br />It almost feels like this album was produced using Project Runway restrictions.<br /><br />Heidi Klum:  Musicians, you have 5 weeks and $9,000 to produce a 14 song collection.<br /><br />Tim Gunn:  Alright everyone, you have 30 minutes to caucus, 45 minutes to compose, and then we're off to the garage where you may use the parts of previous songs to build your collection.  Remember, you can't use any outside help, or hire a professional for any of the design elements.  You may, however, use one guest performer for one of your songs. Make it work!<br /><br />IMHO-Coldpay, You're Out!!! Auf Wiedershen!arrassing mediocrity.  I have a feeling this one will get tossed in the back seat.

B00466HN72|5|I absolutely loved this movie!  I'm 34 and took my eight year old niece and my brother who is 35.  We all laughed the whole time.  The movie is cute!  I loved the ninja bunnies, the bunny who had a dream to be a muscian, not the Easter Bunny as he was suppossed to be.  And Carlos the chick really added some fun to it.  The eight year old still talks about the movie!  It was a cute story and the E.B. kept you laughing the whole time!
B004SJ3BCI|5|if you don't know what this series of games is, then it won't do any good trying to explain it to you.  Find someone with a tablet / smartphone, or even a roku xs, and become addicted to solving the puzzles.
B00005JJX8|5|Was impressed with the prompt processing of my order and in its fast delivery.  I have watched the movie twice.  I really like most of Cary Grant's movies, and this one's no exception.  The package was in great condition.  I will likely use Amazon again.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Overall I really enjoyed the book, but I think you hate and even despise almost every character at least once- some way more than others. Easy thriller/murder mystery for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|5|its very nice u can look at your histry so if u hit clear on accident you can look at your history and see what it was u were looking for i use it for homework help and its great!
0783228457|5|This is a strange movie dealing with a mysterious cable signal that gives viewers uncanny hallucinations.  James Woods is a cable station operator  who investigates the source of the signal and eventually succumbs to it's  effects.  Lots of slimy special effects including a man who turns inside  out after being shot and a pistol that fuses to Woods's hand.  Some viewers  may be offended by scenes of female torture and bondage so beware.   Overall, a highly enjoyable and yet somewhat confusing film from the great  master of biological horror.
B008FRFN7A|4|Great app to have if you have a HP e-print enabled printer.So far it has worked flawlessly with my desktop,laptop,and various tablets and phones.
0061990477|2|I remember in the 80's the TV movie was a sensation. I did not watch it due to school.  However I was curious as to what made it so popular.  So I read the book. A third way in it was interesting, but then the story dragged.  So I switched to audio book version.  The story never got anywhere.  Events came and went, people grew up, got old. But no one you could really root for. The problem may be that the author spread the plots through three generations so they dilute any impact the story might have on the main characters, namely Ralph and Meggie.  With the hindsight of current abuse scandals involving priests, I could not help but feel uneasy about Ralph's early affections for Meggie, however innocent it may be.  Also, the lust that Mary (Meggie's aunt) had for Ralph seemed abnormal even judged by 21st century standard.  One cannot help but compare this to Gone With the Wind.  However, you do care for characters in GWTW, no matter if they were good, bad, meek or strong.  And you would keep looking forward to each new chapter.  I wish I could say the same for \\"The Thorn Birds.\\"
0143038419|1|It's all about new age occultism. If you want to take this ladies advice and have to go to exorcist, id recommend burning this book and saving your time.
B005IQZB14|5|For some reason I wasn't expecting much from this book.  I've read a lot of books about hiking the AT but never the PCT, and I don't know much about it.  But it did not matter for this book.  I learned a lot about the PCT and so much more.  Cheryl was unbelievably honest and told us of her every thought/experience, no matter how bad or good.  I loved this book & could not put it down! I'm telling all of my girlfriends and several have read it or going to.  I've already started one of Cheryl's other books.  She is a very skilled, thought provoking and enjoyable author.  I plan to read all of her books!  Thank you for sharing Cheryl!
B00HBQWGXK|5|Child's reached new highs for me.
B004XUMMFE|5|It's a shame this only lasted a season. Connected cast, good story, and well produced. This could have been an amazing and iconic franchise.
B000IFQLSW|5|A great record of this thirty year old musician, which besides singing very well plays the guitar wonderfully although in this album Shepherd doesn't sing. Shepherd began playing guitar at five and at thirteen made his debut in a live concert with the singer and guitarist Bryan Lee (his reunion is recorded: \\"Bryan Lee - Live At The Old Absinthe House Bar....Saturday Night\\", and makes a very good record).  \\"10 Days Out\\" this sensational live album  contains great themes as by instance \\"Little Red Rooster\\" one of the better classical and outstanding Blues song ever composed by maecenas of Blues, Willie Dixon, that by the way The sensational Rolling Stones made an extraordinary cover in the first 60's, in addition to assembling a quantity of top musicians like  Cootie Stark and Neal \\"Big Daddy\\" Pattman, Jerry \\"Boogie\\" McCain, B.B.King, Bryan Lee, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown (one of the better of all the times a true number one), Henry Townsend, Etta Baker, Henry Gray, Hubert Sumlin ( the permanent  guitarist of another monster, HOWLIN WOLF),  \\"Wild Child\\" Butler, Pinetop Perkins (one of the better Blues pianist alive and one of the better of all the times). It is perhaps the best of his discography and for sure the one with the purest Blues contents.   Highly recommended. I give it 5 stars.
B00006AUIG|5|An excellent, suspenseful thriller with a good cast.  FULL of chills.
B008Q0AZVK|3|Great sexy movie.  Really liked it.  Not really a Robert Pattison fan, but he was pretty good here.  Uma Thurman was as well.
B00BAXFJ5M|3|Good entertaining read.  A little predictable but enjoyed it. I would always like more historical background so that a book is an entertaining read and an educational experience.
B000059QY3|5|I am shocked! I have watched and listened to hundreds of &quot;Traviata&quot;-s in my life, but I never imagined that I would be so moved with yet another outstanding recording. This is amazing. Angela Gheorghiu is brilliant - she shows everything: radiance, fun, passion, love, drama, despare. She is the most perfect Violetta of our time. Well, she doesn't sing high E flat at the end of the I Act but who cares? Look at her - she has stunning looks and one of the most warmest and beautiful voices I've ever heard. If one takes into consideration the fact that this was her operatic debut, everything I just mentioned is even more unbelievable. Alongside Gheorghiu is the very strong supporting cast: Leo Nucci is one of my favourite baritones and he is at his best. Nothing seems difficult to him, its amazing. Lopardo (Alfredo) has very strong voice, mostly his singing is very good, however at some places I would rather here warmer sound, I would rather believe him more. And finally, Georg Solti's conducting is  great, the orchestra and the chorus is like one, every single detail is worked out and syncronized. So at the end, I should say this is must have DVD. This is Gheorghiu's triumph, this is her night and it is amazing watching her and sharing this precious moment with her.
B00EOARZ4G|3|Did not care for the plot jumping back and fourth over 30 years.<br />This book was not a page turner for me.
B00H6W47C2|4|Baldacci keeps churning out the super heroes, but they lack the mystery and tense pacing of his earlier works.  Somewhat implausible, but a reasonable holiday read.  I'm a Baldacci tragic.

B00CKOYVG8|2|Enjoyed trying the practice games, but could go no further without joining Facebook. Have no desire to do so, so this game is not for me, hence the low score. Will be uninstalling it for that reason only. Great graphics and effects, all up to Rovio's high standards. Good game for Facebook fans.
0307951529|5|The $100 Startup is an absorbing, inspiring read that prompts successful entrepreneurs to review their business model and offers those just starting out valuable insight from the field.<br /><br />After following Chris and his Art of Non-Conformity blog for quite some time I was very much looking forward to reading this book. As a young full-time RVer the important combination of freedom, passion, income, and doing work that matters is always top of mind. The $100 Startup offers a concise roadmap for those seeking independence and to live life on their own terms.<br /><br />That being said, Chris is clear that starting and developing a successful 'microbusiness' is indeed work, albeit a labor of love. The 'do what you love and the rest will follow' mindset is replaced by the more practical concept of convergence - 'your passion + what others care about'.<br /><br />Throughout the book we are inspired by examples of people just like us that have unexpectedly or intentionally created businesses around what they have to offer and what others need. Some entrepreneurs profiled in the book have made a huge splash while others have quietly conquered their corner of the world.<br /><br />Each chapter offers actionable and specific details on the topic at hand. Some examples are given in graphical or chart format and readers will find key points - or takeaways - at the end of each chapter. The 'Fish Stories Appendix' presents a thought-provoking chart offering 25 selected case studies focusing on their fact-based descriptions and emotion-based promises. From concept to promotion to growth strategies to fear of failure, Chris has your back.<br /><br />Regardless of where you are in your life, your business or your relationships, Chris refers to Seth Godin's mantra, 'ship', and offers this wise advice: 'You don't need anyone to give you permission to pursue a dream'.<br /><br />If this calls to your dream, get this book, stop 'making a living', and start making a life.
B00TEAVEY8|5|This game is really,really my favorite, because the cases are real and you  as the player you are doing a lot to solve the cases.
B001UV4XIS|4|Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history.  And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper.  For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.<br /><br />The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents.  The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.<br /><br />As directed by David Yates, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2\\" has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element  - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion.
B0002DB0FO|5|Wow Just seen the first 3 episodes of \\"Our new life in Everwood\\" [UK Title] on TV. We are only on season one and its on daytime tv - no prime time as yet.  This is a really well thought out series. Lots of everything and so far not afraid to tackle sensitive subjects!  Well done and can't wait to see season 2 3 and 4!   <br />Will be collecting the DVD's
B000JMKTLO|5|A really entertains novel. I really developed likes and dislikes of the chAracters. The end is an awesome payoff. Enjoy
B002UD56I6|5|I am not a fan but was asked to see the movie with a friend. I knew he was talented but he was also a perfectionist you may not like his music but his dancing and vocal ability are unreal....
0385738765|5|its a book!
B00A8MGIZG|5|I am really into past lives, future lives, present lives and so loved this movie.  I have watched it about 4 times now.  I also loved the make-up used so that sometimes you had to really study the person's face to know for sure who you were looking at.  The whole idea of karma was really at play for me.  Bottom line -- I truly loved this movie.

B000YABIQ6|5|Mad Men blew me away last summer when it burst upon the scene. In an era when scripted entertainment had been written off as all but moribund, Mad Men changed the rules and brought in the kind of quality you don't normally see on American television. This DVD anthology is worth every penny, as much for the series as for the extras. And, hey, anyone ever seen a more novel package than a replica of a Zippo? Mad Men is an original that has revitalized episodic TV itself. May its quality never slip!
B005FNSJDC|4|given as a gift to grandson
B008NW67E0|5|Babel is more of the same from Mumford & Sons. I loved their Sigh No More, so this one was a real treat for me. &#34;I Will Wait&#34; is a great single.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this album is that they sound like they're in a jam session. When I'm listening, I feel like I'm getting to hear a group of friends who are just enjoying themselves.

081297381X|4|So many people seem to genuinely dislike Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  Is it envy?  Was it a personal slight?  Did he make them 'feel stupid' at some point? Not hard to do I imagine.  Taleb's brain and soul are a combination to be envied, and in the current cultural context, perhaps feared.<br /><br />He's in love with his idea, which is a good thing.  And with himself, maybe not such a good thing if it turns people off. Then again, I probably would be too were I that smart. I figure that he has survived Lebanon, cancer, Wall Street, and Massachusetts, and thus earned the right to brag a bit. Lucid analysis, epistemological practicality, and even some fun await if you're willing to invest the time and effort.<br /><br />I didn't find the book as intimidating as some have, but there are certainly a few \\"wait, back up, read again\\" moments. Just take the time to wrap your head around this and you won't be sorry.<br /><br />His is a damn good framework for addressing complexity.  An idea that can help us all - not just the rich and powerful - adapt to those events, both micro and macro, whose impact is huge but which are impossible to predict.<br /><br />I'm grateful for the man's thoughtfulness.

B00PSLQYWE|5|Always a treat to watch Downton Abbey.  Well developed characters set against a historical background. Can't wait for season 6
B008GOAFBQ|4|While I'm disappointed that the two disc version wasn't released, I really enjoyed the Destroyer \\"Resurrected\\" experience. The new mix overall gives the album a fresh clean thumping sound... I probably would have left the echo on the snare drum in God Of Thunder and I still dont understand why the new version of Sweet Pain isn't the bonus track, instead of interrupting the original track sequence with a different solo... From what I've read online, the clitch at the beginning of Flaming Youth is Universal's problem and I look forward to them replacing my CD with one that doesn't skip (as it is very annoying).
B002ZG997M|5|The Book of Eli is a vastly underappreciated film that mixes martial arts swordsmanship, a post-apocalyptic setting, and a biblical narrative.<br /><br />A war, over thirty years ago, killed off many people in the United States. Others were blinded from the blast.  This creates an interesting disparity between those over thirty years of age who received an education and those under thirty who know nothing of the modern world (at one point, one of the thugs asks, \\"What's a television?\\").<br /><br />This is an unpleasant world. Cannibalistic brigands ambush unwary travelers, identifiable by their shaking hands. Water is at a premium.  Batteries are hard to find.  The Book of Eli makes it clear that there's no currency, only barter.<br /><br />Roaming the land is Eli (a subdued Denzel Washington), carrying a book with a cross on it.  This book is greatly desired by Carnegie (a greasy Gary Oldman), who is also old enough to remember the power such a tome can have over the people.  While Eli has been wandering for thirty years in pursuit of such a destination, Carnegie has been sending illiterate henchmen to retrieve every book he can find.  The encounter between the two has all the fire and brimstone of a battle between heaven and hell.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is Solara (played beautifully by Mila Kunis, who finally sheds her trademark accent), a young, attractive girl who has grown up under Carnegie's protection but, as she flowers into womanhood, is about to become a bargaining chip, a piece of meat, and a lure.  When there's no one left to protect her, she becomes a wanderer in Eli's footsteps.<br /><br />From a religious point of view, it's educational to understand who Eli was in the Bible. In the Bible, Eli's children are cursed for behaving wickedly, a parallel for the war that destroyed civilization in the movie. God's curse assures that all men will \\"die by the sword\\" - in the movie Eli expertly cuts a bloody swath through his enemies with his machete. In the Bible, it was the job of Eli's sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.<br /><br />There's a twist ending that's not a twist of all if you read up about Eli in the Bible. But don't - watch the movie, then do some research, then watch the movie again.  Like Eli's quest for spiritual fulfillment, the experience will be rather eye-opening.sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.

B000060P79|4|I enjoyed it.Wow people are very touchy on here. They get upset at people for liking something they hate. What one person may relate to or enjoy listening to may be very different from the next person, it's common. Don't get your feelings hurt because someone connects with an artist in a way that you don't. All you true-to-your-genre fanatics who get so worked up about what is or isn't punk or whatever, please, get over yourselves. Music is about what makes you feel good, what you can relate to and what gets you, who cares what it's label is..you &quot;punk&quot; fans aren't supposed to be into labeling anyway right? Well I enjoy the CD, it's fun to listen to, not one of the more profound Albums I own but it's nice when the mood is right. Good Stuff.
B006ZBRMOU|5|I enjoyed this set of books very much. I found myself engulfed and could not put them down. They were so well written and the story was so easy to follow.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I have no other words for The Fault In Our Stars. It left me absolutely speechless. Such a beautiful story. What a novel.
B001NLL93W|5|I find this series entertaining, complex but light.  The character development is quick and continues to deepen with each book.  This series is the perfect way to relax after a stressful day.
B008WCP2PG|2|I can't believe I wasted money on this movie.  Everyone was talking about how great it was.  I didn't like it at all.
B008ODZEQ0|4|The camera work in this documentary is truly exceptional. It's equal to the quality of the fish and skill of Jiro and his sons. The underlying theme of dedication to (perhaps) the point of obsession is what left me with an unsettled feeling. I truly admire the skill and artistry of what Jiro does, but I don't know if I sensed that the sons held the same depth of love for the work.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Chris
0143124544|5|Note to any who purchases this book: do not read in public as you will cry uncontrollably during certain parts.  With that said, this book was beautifully written, surprisingly witty, and overall just an incredible read.  Definitely a book that sticks with you well after you read it.
B00000I07P|5|I love Slippery When Wet so much. It has a lot of great songs. I was blown away when I first listened to it at the start of this year. I'm only 15, I love the 80's and most kids my age don't listen to this kind of stuff but I think it's awesome! Bon Jovi is one of my favorite bands and I highly recommend this album.

1400049628|5|This book is the essential guide to survival while living with the undead! Thanks to this book and my prior military service, I was able to survive to write this today when my family became the undead and turned on me. Thank you Max Brooks! You saved my life!<br /><br />But in all honesty, I've read some reviews and I have to say that I believe the only humor was the fact that it was about zombies taking over Earth. Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't. This book takes a serious approach and would indeed be essential to anyone who was not familiar with the undead or had received various offensive/defensive training. I personally think this book was a work of genious and believe it should at some point be incorporated into a movie. Too many times have I watched a zombie movie (the new \\"Dawn of the Dead\\") where the people never even said the word \\"zombies\\" and no-one ever seems to realize that a good head shot will put these things down permanetly. I think almost everyone should have a copy of this book in their homes. Not because it's \\"funny\\" or as a gag, but because the chance that something weird WILL happen, and we WILL become overrun by zombies, but because the strategies and tactics in this book can MOSTLY be translated over to what to do in case of WW III or a nuclear holocaust scenario. However, the zombies shouldn't be discounted.
B0030Y11XS|5|Good job
B00JCW0BCY|5|Everyone needs to read this book. Life changing.
B0058UXHHK|4|Quite enjoyable read!
B000XUBFE2|5|This book has a lot to do with history and is great for those that don't favor history.<br />I have never known much about WW2 and really feel educated after this. The characters became family and you could feel their pain.<br />Great read!
B001ADPMQS|5|This is one of my all time favorites! Now I get to share it with my little boy!
B00000IL26|5|I was really surprised by this CD. I didn't know Lee Morgan before and I think that, at least this CD, is really good, even for jazz beguinners. As you know, for newbies, there are basically two kinds of jazz: the \\"good & easy one\\" and the \\"bad & extrange one\\" . Well, so this is from the first set.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love this version. Being able to have verses read to you is great, especially with my 9 year old.
B00081U7HC|5|Awesome movie....great cast, great plot and some great lines!
B003Y5H5FG|5|I loved it! I'm a fan of vampire movies and tv shows and this movie is now one of my new favorites. Colin Farrell was execellent as a vampire. A btter vampire than Robert Pattinson. Anton Yelchin was so cute in this and tough as a vampire hunter in training. David Tennant was really amazing as Peter Vincent. My sister and where fsngirling when he came on, those parts where really funny. I would recomment this movie to anyone who love vampire movies to buy it.
B00EY8BRGU|4|The movie  was full of suspense and the ending was  just awesome!  Did not see it coming. Had my doubts about seeing it, so  glad I did.
B004I7IPL2|2|Seemed a lil cheesy. Just looked like the budget was small
B007J4T2G8|1|Biggest waste of not only my money but my precious time. There is not one worthwhile aspect of this book. It is poorly written, trite and has nothing of any interest to say. It is not the slightest bit entertaining either. You would be better off staring at a blank wall than wasting time reading 50 Shades.
0393317552|4|Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power by Victor Davis Hanson is an interesting read.  The central thesis of the book is that the Western style of direct decisive infantry warfare, with roots in democracy and capitalism, has been historically superior and partly responsible for the Western Worlds superior position.  Hanson seeks to present his book as a kind of rebuttal to Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond.  <br />As to the latter objective. Hanson fails miserably for Hanson's and Diamond's theories are not inconsistent and Hanson's attempt to make them so detracts from the rest of the book..  Diamond's seeks to explain why it was the Spanish who conquered the Incas in 16th century Peru and not Incas who sailed to Madrid to conquer the Spanish.  He theorizes that the Spanish had greater access to domesticatable crops and animals and European geography allowed for an easier exchange of ideas from other burgeoning societies.  Hanson seeks to minimize the advantages of what  Diamond speaks of and instead focuses on military strategy, and western economic and political thought.  What Hanson misses is that without advanced military transport in the horse, the availability of sophisticated weapons, such as steel swords, rudimentary guns and cannon the Incas would never have been conquered.<br />Hanson's own treatment of the conquest of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) in 1520-1521 is the proof.  The Mexican Army utilized infantry tactics, since they did not have any calvary.  They fought decisive battles with their opponents, since like the ancient Greeks they had a war season.  While the Greeks was based on the harvest, the Mexican was based on the harvest and religious considerations.  While they also fought symbolic flower wars these were not the ones fought to protect their Empire.<br />The Spanish, with several hundred Spaniards and thousands of natives under Cortez, were able to defeat the Mexicans.  It was the horses, guns and eventually smallpox which were decisive. There can be no argument that Spain or Cortez operated in a democratic or that capitalism was the basis of their economy. One can even argue that what defeated the Aztecs was their penchant for human sacrifice and the desire to capture Cortez instead of killing him.  In numerous battles the Aztecs could have killed Cortez but did not.  <br />Hanson's and Diamond's book build on each other and offer a compelling explanation to justify each others theories.  Hanson unintentionally builds on Diamond's concepts to explain why societies with equal resources do not necessarily develop equally.<br />Otherwise, Hanson's book is well written and very interesting.  It is in the description of the battles and the campaigns where he excels.  It would have been better if Hanson had dealt with some of the possible exceptions to his theory - the century old Ottoman Empire, the supremacy of the Prussian military tradition which was hardly based on notions of democracy and the Russian almost suicidal defense of their homeland at Stalingrad.  Maybe he is saving that for his next book.

0345442970|3|\\"Cloak of Deception\\" is the first Star Wars novel that I have read.  This novel is set before the events of \\"The Phanton Menace\\" and set some things in motion which help better explain potential questions raised in the movie.  Some questions that get addressed in this book: \\"What is the deal with the Trade Federation?\\", \\"Why is Chancellor Valorum ineffective as the leader of the Senate?\\", \\"How does the Senator from such a small planet has such influence in the Senate?\\".<br />We are in the waning days of the Galactic Republic.  The Trade Federation has an absurd amount of power, influencing the Senate and maintaining control over trade lanes.  They are, in effect, a Galactic Monopoly.  Few in the Senate are willing to deal with this growing problem, but there are bands of terrorists attacking the Trade Federation in the Outer Rim.  Members of the Trade Federation have entered into an alliance with a mysterious figure only known as Darth Sidious.<br />The Jedi-Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi get involved in one of the terrorist attacks and sensing a larger problem that is worth getting involved in, Qui-Gon defies the Jedi Council and continues to work to find the root of the terrorist problem and the Trade Federation.  Qui-Gon also foils an assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum, and the implications of this event are far reaching.<br />I did not have very high expectations regarding this book.  I have not heard very many good things about the quality of the Star Wars novels.  The beginning of this novel was moderately weak as I didn't find any of the characters to be engaging at all (despite my familiarity with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan).  They seemed to be simply acting, and Luceno was not very successful in revealing who these men, women, and aliens were.  About halfway through the novel, the story picked up a bit and I was able to get into it a bit more, and I enjoyed the book more than when I began.  It was good enough that I'm willing to try a few more Star Wars novels and try to work my way through the series for a while longer so that I can see what happens after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".  This isn't a great book, but it's not bad.  It is middle of the road science fiction set in the Star Wars universe.to try a few more Star Wars novels and try to work my way through the series for a while longer so that I can see what happens after the events of \\"The Return of the Jedi\\".

B00003CXCT|1|i can't believe George Lucas is only releasing the \\"Special Edition\\" versions of these movies.  He completely destroyed everything about these movies that were so great.  Those out-dated effects still work today and the puppets look better than CGI effects made these movies spectacular!   The fact that George wont release the original, and TRUE versions of the movies proves that he isn't an artist to respect, but more of a business man, with no respect for any of his fans or anybody that helped him put those original masterpieces together.  I will not buy this set, I'll wait for the original movies which will no doubt be released a few years from now so Lucas can milk even more money from those who buy this one.

I have to give all the credit to my cousin who showed me what happened when the power ran out on fnaf 1 and I nearly crapped myself. Nice to know that so many like the game as much as I do.

0865478007|4|I'm over half way through this book and find it extremely worthwhile; concise, hard-hitting and easily understandable.<br /><br />My only nitpick, which I do not believe calls into question the book's credibility, is the author referencing the Allhat study of blood pressure medications as a good example of studying different medications' relative effectiveness.  Ironically, this study's conclusions have been harshly criticized and held up as example of how not to interpret data.  In this book, the author said it demonstrated that an existing, cheaper, diuretic was \\"much better\\" compared to another new drug (there actually were 2 other drugs used).  The study failed to highlight that the patients using the existing diuretic were 17% or 43% more likely to develop diabetes relative to the 2 other drugs used in the trial.  Not exactly \\"much better\\". Various other criticisms of this study can be found and I will not dwell on them.  However, if the author's point was that side by side studies are effective to highlight different outcomes, the Allhat study may be a good example, but just not with the outcome that the author described.

B0040I09RM|5|Nicely written with a richly-textured plot. There are many interesting characters to follow.
B003YL4KS0|5|This book has been a life changer for my curly haired (3b/c) daughters.  I am astonished at how much healthier and less frizzy their hair looked right away after following the advice in this book, and how quickly the misery and moaning about how much they hated their (beautiful) hair went away.  Thank heavens they are embracing their curls at last!  I have kept my hair super short or spent $$$ to get keratin treatments for years to avoid having to deal with my curls so I remember how much I hated them when I was a teenager, but I'm going to grow mine out now, too.
1603427244|3|Pages are 5.5&#34;x7&#34;. a small format and even smaller pictures makes this an impractical reference book.  Directions for casting on and binding off methods are too sparse, leaving out steps and details.  This is an interesting book to tuck inside your project bag or airline carry on, but it is not a helpful how-to instructional manual.
0684857219|5|The most informative, comprehensive books I've ever read about bodybuilding and nutrition. It's full of pictures and descriptions that make it easy to imitate and keep up with. Plus, lots of very handsome men in this book.
0671759159|5|This is especially good book for beginners (and other who wish to learn more)  who wish to spot investment ideas worth investigating. Peter Lynch had a nice rule of thumb for a quick and dirty method of determining fair value. He asked himself what would be the fair value of this stock if its p/e ratio was 15. For many companies when I do fair value the long way  the answers are often close. I read this book long ago and have reread it. Peter writes well and clearly.
B00A83075M|5|My family and I just thought this was a great movie!!!  Funny and sweet!  There were a couple of sad scenes, and a couple of scenes that I would compare to the scenes from Cinderella when the mean stepsisters tore Cinderellas ball gown!  (Those meanies!)  All in all very cute, lovable, and adorable main characters!  We have watched this movies a few times now!!  Highly recommend this movie!
B0043ZDU1E|5|Loreena McKennit is my favorite all time singer. Her voice and lyrics are so creative and beautiful they easily transport me to another world, another time, another place. Like her choices in arrangements and lyrics. A completely unbeatable voice. I highly recommend any of her albums to those  traditionally and fantasy oriented. Her voice is haunting, lyrical and transportative. Super singer for those who like strong yet obviously female voices. Sometimes she is near angelical.
B0094BB4TW|4|good
B00H2D1XDQ|3|A Hidden Object game that has nice Graphics and decent Music/Sounds along with good difficulty options to suite most players.  However, I feel that it has two drawbacks that caused me to deduct 2 Stars:  It lacks a ZOOM feature that most quality H.O. apps usually include nowadays.  This is especially pertinent with this app because ot the 2nd issue:  They grossly minimize the size of some objects while keeping others larger.  This naturally throws the user off and makes it very hard to find the TINY objects that they SHRANK TOO MUCH.  Users with small screens will have extra difficulty due to lack of zoom feature and looking for super Tiny objects.  Many of them are White objects on White background to make it more agrevating for those of us with less than perfect eyesight.  It also has only 21 levels that go by rather quickly.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad H.O. game with some good options for style and difficulty of play.  Sadly, that is outweighed by the lack of a User Friendly ZOOM feature a d the artificial TINY size of some objects that are placed on same color backgrounds to irritate the player.  Just OK t me and not worth the asking price as it is designed today.  Seems Amatuerish by comparison to Better H.O. games on the market.
B00006DEFA|3|There is a reason a lot of footage ends up on the cutting room floor and it is my opinion that the additional footage in this director's cut should have stayed there. While the scenes do give some additional background information, they are sometimes tedious and therefore slow down the pace of the movie.
B000002NAK|5|I have not listened to the soundtrack itself, but I saw the movie, which  is practically the same thing. I have to say that at first it seemed kind  of out of place (the music selection for the movie) until I realized it was  a musical (to all those Evita's fans out there: I knew nothing about the  broadway play). I have to say that I HATE musicals, with VERY few  exceptions, but this one's great! It was done the way a musical should be  done: the music narrates the story instead of interrupting it. I enjoyed  the ENTIRE movie simply because of how fun and well done the music - and  the lyrics - was. I'll soon buy this soundtrack, and to hell with all those  people who critize it simply because the broadway soundtrack's better; even  if it is, they have to admit this one's good, too. Banderas' definitely  isn't a very good singer, but he provided the funniest moments of the  movie, so I won't complain ther either. 'nuff said.
B001M5UDGS|5|As the other reviews tell you, Dr Horrible is well, fabulous. even if you can get it free on the net it's totally worth buying, not least for the commentary and the excellent musical commentary, which is almost completely done in (all new) songs. This has immediately gone to my top 5 drawer! If you like Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion, Joss Whedon, Felicia Day, funny stuff, singing stuff, sweetly amusing or some cheese then you will love it.
B009UWYFFK|5|Bought the movie for my son, my whole family loves it
B00F35B8F8|4|Good action-packed movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Interesting plot twists from the original Khan movie.
B007H7XJD4|2|Would give 2.5 because effects were pretty good acting was above my expectations.  Did keep my attention throughout but story was awful.  It could probably suit as an entertaining movie with low expectations going in but wouldn't watch again it's a movie to show off what new toys Hollywood has and there are much worse choices out there.
B0037RDPEG|5|Totally enjoyable and so much better than the movie! Read the sequel straight after too!
B00S70EG00|1|Implausable.  I did finish but it didn't  leave a good  taste in my mouth. Best  to refrain from saying  more.

B000I5SY9Q|5|the best screenplay!
B0018OIK0E|5|LOVE this britt zombie film you can't go wrong with this one!
6304106017|5|This is NOT a movie for people who are looking for an intricate plot or finely-detailed, sensitive characters. This is strictly action fare, lots of blood and near-cartoon-like violence, with quite a few twists and turns along the way. Like &quot;Psycho,&quot; it starts out as a crime movie, waits for you to get comfortable with that plot, then BAM--it changes into a horror movie.<br />That's not to say that the characters are two-dimensional or badly acted: most of the actors manage to flesh out their characters quite well (and Quentin Tarantino serves up a guy you do NOT want to ever meet). If you like George Clooney, you'll probably like him here as a bad/good guy with very few morals but a lot of style. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis also turn in good performances, and Salma Hayek is deliciously deadly in her small but pivotal role.
B000Q9ISSQ|5|Book recommended by an acquaintance-am naturalized US citizen and native born Ozzie. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to book via Kindle. Bryson narrates it. Unique perspective and sense of humor. Believe majority of Australians haven't a clue about much of their own country that he loves, visits and regales us with details.
0316067601|5|I have to say this book is an absolute MUST READ!  It is mind blowing what these men went through and the story that is told from it.  I don't think any movie could ever do this book or story for that matter any justice.  I would recommend this book to anyone, even war critics.  It's a real eye opener what these men have gone through across seas.

B000K7VHQE|3|The humor comes quite naturally from a realistic group of characters and how they relate to one another.  The filmmakers are to be commended for that.  It helps that all the actors did such a fine job of bringing everyone to life as well.<br /><br />And yet, believe it or not, it could be more complex.<br /><br />Did I laugh out loud more than once?  I did, and not just at that ending.  (People who've watched it know what I mean.)<br /><br />It's a \\"road movie\\" that you're sure to enjoy.
B00FZM8Z7I|5|I'm 63 and I loved it!
B00IX9UTLU|4|This trilogy was good. Similar to others of its kind.  I felt the ending was slightly abrupt.  After all the build-up, I would have liked to have had the end go on a little longer and into more detail.  Hopefully the companion will add some more to the ending rather than rehashing the middle again.
B000FC11A6|5|Excellent
B006SV2LWA|5|I thought it was a frighteningly realistic depiction of what would happen should we ever encounter this kind of situation. It sort of reminds the audience that we are NOT at all prepared for a public health crisis like this, and that we are still so vulnerable despite all the advances we have made in science and medicine.

B006BG7RI0|5|\\"Casablanca\\" is a motion picture classic beloved by millions.  Warner Home Video has honored this wartime romantic drama with an elaborate box set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its theatrical release.<br /><br />World War II is raging and the Nazis are occupying North Africa, but Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is sitting out the war in Casablanca as proprietor of the most popular nightclub in town.  The cynical Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit permitting their carriers to leave the country.  To placate Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), local police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) detains Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is accompanied by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love.  Old flames are rekindled and Rick plans use the letters of transit to leave Casablanca with Ilsa.<br /><br />The film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked:  Michael Curtiz's direction; a fresh and clever script; colorful characters; the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman; a first-class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson); a haunting song, \\"As Time Goes By,\\" that runs through the film as Rick and Ilsa's love theme; and the immediacy of a war whose outcome was still undetermined.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart, who had previously played gangsters, took on his first romantic lead in \\"Casablanca.\\"  George Raft had unsuccessfully angled for the role of Rick.  Ingrid Bergman, under contract at the time to David O. Selznick, was borrowed by Jack Warner to co-star with Bogart.  Composer Max Steiner was against using \\"As Time Goes By\\" and Warner finally agreed to let him write an original song for the movie, but by then Bergman had cut her hair for another movie and couldn't re-shoot the scenes in which the song was heard.  Sam, Rick's singer-pianist, who performs the song, was nearly made a female, with Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald considered for the role.  Dooley Wilson, the eventual Sam, was a drummer and faked playing the piano.<br /><br />No movie has more memorable dialogue.  \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" was voted as the Number 5 most famous movie quote by the American Film Institute.  Other lines that live in memory include \\"We'll always have Paris,\\" \\"Round up the usual suspects,\\" \\"The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world,\\" and \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"  But Bogie never spoke the line \\"Play it again Sam.\\"  That was the title of Woody Allen's 1972 homage to \\"Casablanca.\\"  Rather, Rick says to Sam, who had performed the song at Ilsa's request, \\"You played it for her.  You can play it for me.\\"<br /><br />The 3-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition box set contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, reproduction of the original 1942 French film poster, 60-page production art book, and collectible drink coaster set.  Among the 14 hours of bonus material are two new documentaries: \\"Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic\\" and a look at the career of director Michael Curtiz; full-length documentaries on the history of Warner Brothers Studio and its founders; outtakes; a vintage cartoon; two radio broadcasts; several short subjects; audio commentary by Roger Ebert; and an introduction by Lauren Bacall.

1401201911|5|I read a lot of &#34;elseworlds&#34; during the 90s and much of them were not really good, so I had lowered expectations for this one.<br /><br />And I was a fool, this book is awesome.<br />Millar takes his time to introduce new versions of the characters, to avoid being jingoistic and even his Luthor is great.
B000FC2L1Y|5|I enjoyed book! Having the audiobook version to accompany the kindlebook helped me get through the 900+ pages in less time.
B008577DT6|5|i was totally in love with the retrospective , behind the scenes , as i am also involved locally in theater, and like to watch all the behind the scenese and outtakes and cast interviews, this makes the whole series seem to be more personal to me ,
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is so awesome. Very addicting. My family loves the game. The owl part is good too.  Hope everyone has fun playing.
B00003CWL6|5|As you have seen from reading the other reviews, there are still a lot of people who want to cushion themsleves from the real world.<br />Then something comes along, grabs everybody and shakes up all sorts of reactions.<br />As  there doesn't seem to be that many anti reviews for other films, I can only  draw the conclusion that, American Beauty must have provoked as much of a  reaction in the people who hated it as those who loved it.<br />On this point  alone I would argue that this is undeniable the best film of 1999, even if  you hated it!<br />A real masterpiece of cinematography for those who look  closely enough.<br />Please, please release it on DVD!
B00DJFIMW6|5|The game is pretty cool and the graphics are great. I've been playing the game for about 1/2 an hour and I have already passed grews lab 7 times.
0307588378|5|I got this for my sister who loves mystery novels. After she was done, our friends and I also read the book. This was before the movie came out and I have yet to see it. I just don't have enough words to describe the evil ingenious this author possess! I recommend this book even to those have seen the movie already.<br />Loved the paperback and the book cover. It arrived on time.
B00AREIAI8|4|Good app. Great for kids or adults especially any horse lover out there. Care and competition easy for any age level to advance.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I read this book, recommended by my friend. I am not the one to cry easily. but I asked her to tell me a book that will change my life and the wah I look at things. this was the one. by the end I was crying enough to fill the ocean, I recommend it to all around 16 into romance and are not afraid to cry at the beautiful words written by John Green
B000003TAL|5|Daydream Nation is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking and influential indie records of the 80's. When you listen to this album, it's easy to hear why. All through the album you can hear a large number of sound layers consisting of guitars with alternate tunings and lots of feedback. This may sound as if Daydream Nation is just some sort of experimental record that you problably won't like. In fact, Daydream Nation is not an experimental record at all. Through every song you can hear a very clear pattern and the alternate tunings and sometimes heavy feedback just add something extra to all of the songs. This is what makes Sonic Youth such a unique band and this is what made them so influential to so many other bands such as Nirvana. Just listen to Daydream Nation first and then listen once more to any of the early Nirvana records and you'll hear what i mean.  <br /> <br />P.s. I saw them live last monday at the Paradiso in Amsterdam and it's just amazing to see how skillfull they are when it comes to handling their instruments. Thurston Moore is simply one of the most genius guitar players around.  Anyway, check out Daydream Nation, you won't be dissapointed.
B00004Z4WR|1|Great movie, but ...But once they start stealign cars and bringing them in the suspense and thrills come along.  Cage has to steal 50 cars in 3 days but he uses 2 days to get his friends together and plan their tactics to steal the cars.  All the nice and luxurious cars makes me wanna be a car-thief when i grow up.  This isn't Cage's best performance by far but it's a good movie to watch.  I don't see where Robert Duvall fits in and Angelina Jolie doesn't give anything to the movie.  Anyone could've played her part, the same with Delroy Lindo. But it's still a good movie to go see.
0062073508|5|Possibly the best mystery novel I've ever read! Only my second Agatha Christie novel, but I'm a fan now!

B0001CNRBG|5|This is a really fun little film with great performances. Alan Alda is weak in some sections, but of course Ellen Burstyn is wonderful, as always. Everyone should own this little gem. I think it might be more of a woman's film, but I still think men can enjoy it too. Really, really great. Especially the jump forward in time, and watching both characters meet at various times in their life.
B005KJJ4F8|5|My sister turned me on to this series, and I started it last night. I've read the Hunger Games trilogy, the Giver quartet, the Host, etc. This is, by far, better than all of them COMBINED!!!! Taking the story of Cinderella, and making it into such a page turner is GENIUS!! As an avid reader, some aspects of the plot were a little predictable. However, that did not stop the story from grabbing me and holding me. I finished this book in about 5 hours, and am excited to read the rest of the series!!!!! I don't know where Marissa Meyer has been all my life, but I'm glad I've found her now!
B0018M6J90|5|THis movie is really good. It is heartwarming and also funny. Amy Adams and Frances McDormand are both great! IT is one of my new favs.
B000FBFN1U|4|By all accounts this is the high point of the series thus far. A book nearly half again as large as the first two, it seems to go by just as quickly. The ascendence of some characters into their destined roles, along with sometimes brutal reversals of fortune, are the keystones of this suspenseful and engaging third volume of Martin's saga. The &#34;Red Wedding&#34; has got to be one of the most nail-biting chapters in all of high fantasy literature. If you haven't read the first two volumes, do so just so you can read this one, it is that good.
B0000027F8|4|\\"Listen without prejudice\\" - a rather strange name for an album by a guy that was at the top of his game when this was released. People were anything but prejudiced towards George Michael at the time. He was a hit-making machine that had also turned into an international object of lust for women all over the world. The expectations from people of this album were extremely high - especially after the monster success of \\"Faith\\" - George Michael's first solo effort. Not only were the expectations high. People expected \\"Faith Vol.2\\". Listening to the album once is enough to convince listeners that this is clearly not \\"Faith Vol. 2\\". In fact, it offers a stark contrast to \\"Faith\\" both in the themes of its songs as well as the overall sound.<br /><br /> The songs are lyrically strong and well-crafted. The music is more stripped down. This is evident on tracks like \\"Heal the pain\\", \\"Something to save\\", and \\"Waiting for that day\\". This is the first album on which George Michael sheds the huskiness of his voice for something substantially smoother and pleasant. Some may feel like this album is a rather \\"heavy\\" affair. I truly believe that the songs sound better when listened to separately or when mixed with songs by other artists. They stand out better when listened along with other music. Listening to the whole album at once may be a little too much for some people. That being said, this album is still a solid effort despite its departure from a sound people typically associate with George Michael.<br /><br />  Those that craved for \\"Faith 2\\" would have to wait till 1996's \\"Older\\" (the perfect sequel to \\"Faith\\").<br /><br />Songs for the casual listener: Soul Free<br /><br />Songs for the George Michael fan: Something to save, Cowboys and Angels,Soul Free, Mother's Pride
0545123275|3|This book is really a typical young adult novel. It seems as though the author got a lot of her ideas from Twilight and ran with it. Nothing too original here.
B00004Y6NW|5|Excellent Debut by Dire Straits, They actually had to work hard to out do this one in the end!
B00KNFJDSW|5|This is the soundtrack from the wonderful movie.  A must see.
B006G35EEC|5|Great family viewing! A real classic.
B004LROUW2|1|I hated this book.<br />I hated this book.<br />I hated this book.<br /><br />This is ho Haruki writes. He takes the same sentence and repeats it over and over again. He takes the same sentence and repeats it over and over again, I say.<br /><br />The story itself is OK, imaginative, but he seems to close off the ending far to quickly. The build up, character development, and nonsense was about 40% of the story. The &#34;action&#34; was about 20%, and the other 40% was repeating the first 40%
B007PTJOV0|5|I love lep's world.I my favorite in the world.u get to explore different worlds and fight different creatures,it's awesome.u play an old,short leprechaun(I named him gephrey.)

B00LZWV8JO|5|I enjoyed the combination of the apocalyptic setting and the science of orbital mechanics. The last third of the book changes in style and setting with additions of genetic modification and sci-fi superstructures.
B003M6EAXM|5|Great show. Jack fought hard til the end.
B005ORVN1Y|5|What you might call \\"Hidden\\" albums can be found in all three Sector box sets AND in the \\"Moving Pictures\\" DVD-Audio disc. If you have a portable DVD-Audio player or have the ability to hear the \\"Surround\\" versions of the music only decoded in \\"Stereo\\" through your system you will discover fun and interesting versions of some of our favourite Rush albums. The Sector box sets are worth the price for these versions alone. Particularly interesting are: \\"By-Tor & The Snow Dog\\", \\"Xanadu\\", \\"Cygnus X-1\\" and \\"YYZ\\". Most fascinating of all are the versions of \\"Witch Hunt\\" (minus the crowd), \\"The Camera Eye\\" (incredibly clear dialogue!) and especially \\"Countdown\\", with ALL the NASA dialogue removed. The latter can be a strange and disconcerting experience but is unforgettable. If you are a musician or are just fascinated with hearing all the notes played or each drumskin hit and roll you won't be disappointed. Geddy's bass and Neil's drums are showcased distinctively in these versions. A welcome and invaluable addition to the best work in the RUSH catalog. I can only hope that when the rest of these Mercury albums are soon released as high resolution downloads they will also be released as physical DVD-Audio discs as well. Enjoy!
B004H4XDBI|5|Loved the first book so I really wanted to know what happened later.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!  Nice closure and continuation of the first book.
B0094BB4TW|5|easy to use app, good for connecting with old and new friends
B004NYQYNQ|5|Best album in a long time.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Just an amazing romp through space.  A fantastic movie that's fun for the whole family.  The action and adventure is great, the special effects are fantastic, but what really makes this movie is the abundance of wit and humor mixed in with that spectacular soundtrack!  Can't wait to see more of these movies!!
B00000294R|5|big l is the illest rapper to rock a mic. his punchlines are soooooo amazing and have me in awe every time he spits his (...). his flow and style and voice is amazing. the beats are basic and nothing really special, but who really gives a (...) this is one of those rap albums where you can relax and chill while listenin to the album.....if you listen to the album you'll realize what a genius he really is.     honestly every song is excellent....no joke. EVERY song has ill flow and sick punchlines and everything else. some songs have guest appearances such as jay-z and kid capri.   RIP Big L    you arent a fan of rap and hip hop if you dont own this album. Seriously.
0345803485|2|Disappointing. It demeans women
B0014NDXGA|5|When you think of a golf ball, your first thought is Titleist.  There's a reason for that.  They are the number one ball in golf!!  The same goes for Bushnell and their rangefinders.  When you need a rangefinder, Bushnell should be your only choice!!  They build a quality, accurate, and an easy to use product!  The Tour V2 is the second Bushnell that I have owned and I will never own anything other than a Bushnell.  This is the first time having one with the &#34;pinseeker&#34; technology and extremely pleased with that feature.  It really does distinguish the pin from background clutter.  The size and weight make it very easy to hold on your target without having to brace it or use a mount.  Definitely the best Bushnell I've had yet.  I know this, when I need yardage and I get it from my Bushnell, I know that I can trust it!!!  Plain and simple!!!!  If you're looking for a rangefinder and are on a budget, this should be your ONLY choice!!!!
B00FHALFK2|5|I really like the variations of the songs. There's slow, heartfelt songs and also fun, grown songs. I bought the cd just for the two slower songs but then I began to really enjoy the rest of the cd.
B001N26GFM|5|A really enjoyed this movie. Sadly, I thought the ending was wonderful as well. Proof that we are punished for our sins. Even if we never hurt someone, we hurt them but not helping them. Wonderful movie.
B003Y5D776|5|I had purchased a couple cheap USB audio interfaces off eBay - they have LEDs that light up/flash when on or muted.  Well, every flash introduced noise into the line.  Since I needed them for my podcast setup, the cheap ones weren't going to work.  I decided to try these to avoid the noise and they work GREAT!  Highly recommend these
B005LAIH4A|5|I bought this as a gift for my 2.5 year old sister because she just loves it (I have not seen it myself yet, but want to!). It came really fast in the mail- I was surprised. It only took 2 days.
B000002KHH|5|This is my favorite Black Sabbath album.This is their best.I still listen to it some times.I would like to hear more.
B00479SVBU|5|It is the greatest device since the invention of the radio! I am very satisfied! When the unit is tuned properly the sound is perfect. It certainly beats carring around a stack of CDs. A USB flash drive, or SD card or and Ipod is all you need to to enjoy a jukebox full of music. The unit and remote has all the features you need, shuffle, bookmark, repeat play, folder change etc.<br /> However,  I think the instructions in the package are poor. Initially I had a problem tuning it according to the instructions. I would have returned it as not working properly had I not found their great video on youtube. It would be a good Idea for them to include a reference their youtube video in the instructions.<br /> The company  also sent me  e-mail requesting feedback on my purchase which indicates a good company.  A company that takes the time to personally ask  for a customers feedback is a company that is going to suceed. Attention to the customer is not everything in business, its the only thing!
B005I6EVUG|5|Classy and stylish.  It feels solid in the hand and fits the kindle perfectly.  It doesn't slip from the hand and it protects the kindle very well.  I recommend buying it.
0345805054|5|This may be a &#34;made up story&#34;, but it contains truths and wisdom that may just change your life. I had borrowed the audio version from my public library to listen to in the car. I knew that I would want to read it again, so bought a copy. This is a book to go back to again and again.
B00FXMECS6|4|Fun movie. Really enjoyed the action and growing dynamic between characters. Malkovich at his best being an LSD experimenter and Willis being overprotective with his action seeking girl is a riot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As always, one more wonderful Grisham's novel, never disappointing, could not stop reading until the end of it. Highly reccommended!
B00B49L7Y4|5|a terrifically well done documentary about an almost unbelievable yet true story. Weeks after seeing it, we still wonder how it was possible! The lead character, Rodiguez, is such a likable person, and deserves whatever he gets from this movie and his late recognition.
B003VANOFY|5|First of all I would like to address all of the one and two star reviews that I read before I purchased this product. Many of them complain about things not working, especially with Windows 7 64bit, however, none of these problems are an issue anymore. Many of the dates on those reviews are from 2009-2010 but Logitech as continued to release new drivers that fix issues. With that being said, do not even bother with the CD in the package as that drivers on that are completely outdated. The CD has version 1.0.xxx, while the latest driver can be downloaded from Logitech directly and at the time of this review is 8.30.86 (See link at end of review). A notably big difference from 1.0. Also disregard any reviews that claim the driver is no longer supported as the latest driver was posted on 06/05/2012.    Feature Review:    -G Keys: 3 Fully programmable G-Keys. The software gives them lots of functionality. Currently I have them setup with teamspeak. Some said this was not possible but it is simple to setup. Just go into teamspeak, go to shortcut keys and set a key combo. Then in the Logitech software set a G-Key to that key combo. Simple really.    -EQ: Nothing more you can ask for. There is a fully 10 channel graphic EQ as well as a simple two channel EQ. To access the graphic EQ click the \\">\\" on the right side of the two channel EQ at the bottom and then \\"Turn on The Advanced EQ.\\"    -7.1 Surround Sound: Works very well. As good as you can expect from a headset. Do note did exceed my expectations. When using the surround sound make sure you flip the switch on the back of the left ear that enables surround sound. I would recommend running the included 7.1 surround sound test.    -Voice Morphing: A novelty really but it works. I don't plan on using it but all the voice did work.    -Wireless Range: Better than I expected! Works through walls and in different rooms as advertised.    -Mic Sensitivity: INCREDIBLE. You will defiantly need to adjust the sensitivity in windowsand other apps that you use. The mic was able to record me whispering \\"1,2,3\\" as quietly as I could so it hears everything.    -Speakers and Noise Canceling: Works well. It does not block 100% of sound but nevertheless it is effective at blocking most sound and focusing your attention on what is playing on the headset.    Other Features I liked:  I love the volume control and mute buttons. The volume control is digital and actually controls windows volume which really impressed me and is a really useful feature. I also love the red LED on the mic boom that indicates if the mic is muted and in case anyone was wondering the mic does mute itself when it is placed in the upright position.    I was also very impressed with the cable management in the wired usb connector. The cable spins up tightly and locks into place (hard to explain but trust me it is very nice). Also the usb receiver plugs into this meaning you only plug in one usb to the back of your computer and you are set for charging and operation.    Good batery life and short(ish) charge time.    The packaging should win an award!    Cons:    -Did not come charged at all    -***The only problem I had with this device is when I was first trying to get it working I had one small problem. The driver was not working and none of the buttons on the headset did anything. If you have this problem where nothing seems to work (easy to know if you have this problem if the red mic mute LED is not coming on) just exit the driver software and turn off the headset. Then start the driver software and THEN turn on the headset. This worked for me. If this does not work for you try turning the headset off and then back on while the driver software is still running.    Overall:    A really wonderful product that I highly recommend!!!    Driver :[...]
B005J87SSA|5|Some moron said this was akin to Green Day, albeit sped up? WTF? Stick with G/D pal and leave BM to True Believers! Blegh! The new Tsjuder slays period! These BM thrashers have indeed returned in full destructive, evil form...formidible and poised to eat post punk bands for Scandinavian breakfast! With cheap beers and probably snow and icicles...and that's about it!!! It's Fast as usual, with their trademark thrashiness intact! Hail! Pummeling fun! Driving epinephrine dumps! Fun! Where the hell is Green Day even in proximity to this? I fell asleep at their show! What a snoozefest! Zero danger! Best rest I've had in years! You got me there! Hails! Tsjuder is heavy where it must be! Daring where is must be! Relentless in execution! Precise, and formulaic, YES!....just like I like it! Who does it better? Not many, O' wandering soul without direction! This is an easy inclusion into the best of the year! Don't think so? Then go back to waiting for Watain to come up with a worthy reprise of Casus Luceferi! Hint: It ain't gonna happen! Uuuuggghhhh. I'll still be here willingly aggrandizing Tsjuder! Tsjuder are delivering the (same) goods over and over and over again! When will you see the light of Satanic glory, thy Pimply bespotted, wanna be metal idiot? Come on over to Helvete...and stick around for a long, long duration! Hehe! FINE! If you don't! We don't need you anyhow! If you like thrash...If you like GOOD death metal...If you like decadent, unabashed, thrashy black metal, then you need look no further than Tsjuder. This or any other of their albums shall suffice! I remain thine unholy Iconoclast! The Clown of Thorns! The Shroud of Turpitude! Hahahahha!
B000NVIXFK|2|Yah, yah,  I'm huge RUSH fan- all their cd's- got suckered into the $100 tickets to the last few tours, etc., etc.   Let's face it- a lot of the fans love their new cd's which is fair and fine and a bunch just find the last few cd's \\"phone-in's\\".  I'm not going to compare this to their moving pics periods, hemispheres, etc. (not fair) cause the band does evolve.  But to what now?  Just old rockers making cd's for their loyal fans.  I like this a little better than Vapor Trails if that means anything.  There's a few actually good tunes on here (the instrumentals- the monkey song is great) but it is already collecting dust on my cd shelf along Vapor Trails.  There's Sooooo much more fun/better/relevant music out these days (and I'm not just talking rockers) that I buy a new Rush cd, listen to it for a week or so and then move on.... forever.  Thank god for their back catalog!
B00N6PCXME|5|Sublime. Wonderfully written.  Ishiguro's gentle touch in weaving a tale of right and wrong, of ancient ways versus modern ways leaves the reader pondering the deeper questions about life and the relationships each of us will hopefully be lucky enough to experience.

B002MQYOFW|5|The \\"Hunger Games\\" series is a great read for young adults, especially young women. Living in a time where the majority of teen fiction is centered on a romance, I think that the \\"Hunger Games\\" really stands out as a series that takes young female readers seriously. Female readers enjoy reading about adventures, fighting, and hardship just as much as they enjoy romances. The fact that the market for teen books is mostly comprised of teen romance or, even worse, teen paranormal romance, is disturbing. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a great read for all ages; my mother enjoys reading it just as much as I do. The fact that the main character is a strong female is almost as impressive as the point that all of her male relationships are platonic (well, to her anyway. Spoiler alert!)
B007J4T2G8|5|I decided when these first came out that I would not read them. I don't like all that spanking stuff and if I wanted to watch a porno I would. Now I'm glad I waited because if I had to wait for book 2 to come out I would go crazy!!! This is a well written live story that never stops. Normally there are natural places in books whee you can put them down and go to sleep or go to work!  Not in this book. Be prepared to read it straight thru if you can!!
B008Y6U5AM|5|Great family movie. We enjoyed it very much!

0446547638|3|(3.5/5)<br />-<br />I have a confession, I have never own a Nicholas Spark’s book. Nor, have I ever read one of his works. I have watched all the films that are based on his books, but I’ve been told the books are better. Seeing the trailer for The Best of Me, got me interested in the storyline, and I decided it’s about time I go get a paperback copy and find out what’s the fuss is all about.<br /><br />The story travels back and forth in means of memories and reminiscence, between Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole – teenagers – whom fell in love back in 1984. Now twenty-five years later and they are reunited, but since then, so many things has changed – they both have changed. What will become of the two of them?<br /><br />The characters, were varied in personalities and as allowed myself to immerse in the story, they seemed like real people – or rather traits you’d find in people – dishonesty, jealousy, fear, regret, and even a few found happiness. There was so much that I can relate to Dawson – personality wise – and reading about his “acceptance” of what life has been pushed on him, I found that …. Comforting.<br /><br />Amanda, has it tough – with her parents always trying to be the decision makers – even as she becomes a grown women. Honestly, I would have hate it for my parents to treat me that way. But, further into the story, you see that Amanda is at fault, as well; she doesn’t ask or even seem to care about her parents. And, it is important to keep in mind that her parents only want what is best for her. If I were in their shoes, and my daughter was dating a boy whose family is known to be criminals, I’d worry and not hesitate to let her know what’s on my mind, as well. Her responsibilities 25 years later, how Amanda grew, and matured was interesting.<br /><br />I did not know how this story was going to end, not until the beginning of the last chapter. I admit to have cried a bit, for all of them. It was heart-breaking. But, I also see it as realistic. Sometimes, you make a decision and you are offered a way out of it, but sometimes it sticks to you forever, and what Spark shows, is that you have to live with it and move on. That’s what I believe the theme of this book is all about – accepting.<br /><br />Overall, a classic. I recommend for those of you who are into dramatic reads.ng. But, I also see it as realistic.

B0054JZC6E|5|this app is fun and addictive. and very entertaining. down load this.app and you wing be dissapointed. you will enjoy. I. hope.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE SERIES. Was not expecting this ending. Really wondering what's next????<br />I love the cast and hate it when some of them leave.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Definitely addictive.  As the levels get more difficult, it has taken me several tries to complete each one.  I'm sure I would do better if I would buy their helps, but &#34;I'd rather do it myself, thank you.&#34;  Can't give it five stars because a lot depends on the randomness of the pieces that drop into the puzzle.  There is some strategy which makes it fun and a challenge.
B005LAIHZE|3|Decent flick

B00168OINK|3|By day, Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black) struggles as a waiter in his father's noodle shop.  But he dreams of being a kung fu warrior.    When he learns the Dragon Warrior is finally going to be named, he rushes to the temple and by accident ends up at the end of the Ooway the Ancient Turtle's (voice by Randall Duk Kim) pointing finger when he makes the proclamation. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his five fighting pupils are all dismayed at the choice, but Ooway advises them there are no accidents.      Finally, when the snow leopard Tai Ling (Ian McShane) breaks out of jail and comes to wreak his vengeance on teh valley, Shifu agrees to help Po learn to fight.  All he needs is to believe in himself and work hard...    Dreamworks has done a great job with the CGI for this film. The animation is smooth and the characters really do seem real.  The Chinese countryside is beautiful as well.      Clearly, from the video games and plush toys you can find on Amazon, this movie may well be a contender for largest sales of related products.  The movie itself is entertaining for kids of all ages.     Rebecca Kyle, June 2008
B007J4T2G8|5|I bought this book because of the reviews and I am so glad I did. I love this book, it was so good i could't put it down. I readed it in two days. buy it!
B00AREIAI8|5|I really liked it!<br />It is never slow or pauses, and even though it takes a while to load, it s awesome.
B00DPM90C4|5|Wow this read was a ride. The writing was clear and crisp. The character development was interesting as the author over time let out bits and pieces. The action was keen moving right along. At the end of the story one was left with hope the Author will bring his Character's back in another book.

B00003CX9E|4|[[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />A Professor and movie buff at my place of work and I got into a conversation about Orson Welles. Asking me if I ever seen the movie Citizen Kane I replied although I knew of the movie I did'nt recall ever seeing it. So I purchased it. Considered by many as the greatest movie ever made it did not disappoint. The acting was terrific. The camera angles and shots were for the time in a league of their own. Making a movie based on the lastword of a dying man (rosebud) and keeping you the movie goer watching until the end just to find out what he meant was also amazing.<br />To bad we do not see Hollywood put more of these types of movies out.<br />To find the best that Hollywood has to offer I believe you must look to it's past.This movie is an shining example of that.<br />Well worth the purchase price and a fine addition to any movie collection.

6302787068|5|Now this, is something that Robin Williams has done much of in his carrer, really two things, 1 Singing, 2 Doing a voice in an animated movie. But this is true good to be true. As Aladdin opens, a vizier named Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) has finnaly found the Cave of Wonders, which I guess, he spend about half of his life, searching for it. But the Cave of Wonders has strict rules, that only the diamond in the rough can go in there, and the other touch nothing but the lamp or never again see the light of day.
B00785P2QC|4|This game is fun but can be a little confusing so be patient. It got it free but might have paid a little for it.
B004SBQGHS|1|l was so exited when l got it but it never fully loaded it was all white and so slow
B0063IH60K|3|Good waste of time
B00LU0P9L4|5|Love it . Scary and challenging. Great story line. Like the graphics.  Played it for hours. Will buy new games like this. Fun fun fun fun
B00B7NPRY8|5|I first read Dune as a teenager and thought it was a wonderful adventure novel set in a fantastic future universe.  Years later I reread it and decided that it was actually about the impact of ecology on human cultures.  Subsequent rereads convinced me the story revolved around religion, and then politics.  In reality it is all these themes and more, an incredibly deep and satisfying story that weaves many disparate elements together with a wonderful cast of characters.<br /><br />Dune is one of *the* classics of science fiction.  If you haven't read it yet then I envy you the experience of discovery that awaits you.
B00P42WROG|5|King did it again..couldn't put it down.  He is the master of thrill.  Keep it coming.
B005LFQRTC|5|I hadn't seen these since they originally aired and enjoyed both pilots. Video quality is good and so is the price.
0307454541|4|I love mysteries and thrillers so I picked this up  six months ago because of all the hype surrounding it. It wasn't what I expected. There are plenty of reviews which will give you a synopsis so I'll skip that. The strange thing is I actually enjoyed this little story about a guy who takes on this missing persons investigation. And I can't figure out why. Despite what I've read from some of the reviews there's not a lot of violence or sex in the book (there are some parts but they make up a small minority) and I think the gratuity functions too create a feeling of disgust in the reader. The sexually depraved characters are the ones you're supposed to dislike and you dislike them because of their sexual depravity so I think it's necessary. But aside from that, for some reason I felt myself being pulled into this book and wanting to know what had happened in this Vanger family. It really does draw you in and I can see why this was an international bestseller.  It is by no means the best book I've read (even this year) but it's definitely worth a read.
B00EIBO8UK|1|After buying this movie by a recommendation, I broke it in half and threw it away because of the nudity and lack of deceny.
B003TML0VO|2|There's nothing inspiring in this collection.  I liked the coice of songs, but Santana didn't bring anything new to them.  Sounds like he just phoned it in.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Found Paula's writing to be superb.  Want to now read more of her work. Loved the romance and mystery entwined.  Being divorced I also understood a lot of the emotions that evolved.  I would recommend to all female adult readers.
B0020BUWX2|5|Well written--a tear jerker--so emotional--such family dynamics.  Loved it!
B00HHJPUFM|5|The kids just love this movie.  They enjoyed the first and now the second.  Great movie and would recommend it to anyone. Funny!
B000ZLFALI|5|How did I miss this movie when it was released in the theatres?  This is a beautifully filmed story (yes, it has a plot) set to the background of Beatles' songs sung by a phenomenally talented group of newcomers.  It's theme of peace couldn't be more appropriate for our times. It soars as high as your imagination.  You'll never think of G.I. Joe the same way again.
B002RXMG00|4|Ageless brilliance.
B000000YG5|5|The question of who was the greater tenor sax player--Rollins or John Coltrane--continues even today. Let's look at it this way...in 1956, Coltrane was gaining prominence in Miles Davis' quintet, but he was far from being a great player. He did not yet have the technique to express the wild ideas in his brain. A year later, however, he went to play with Thelonious Monk's quartet, and the experience liberated him and his style. Only at that point could he truly hold his own against Rollins, who was already a mature player by 1956. Compared side by side, it seems Coltrane recorded more bona fide classic albums than Rollins, but I don't believe any of them are as consistently great as &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot; (&quot;Giant Steps&quot; comes closest). Rollins' playing throughout the album is extraordinary, especially on the last number, &quot;Blue 7&quot;, a strange blues improvisation which features one of Max Roach's fiercest drum solos. Tommy Flanagan plays piano, and he is known to double the quality of any album he plays on. Doug Watkins plays the bass, and he's got a nice sense of swing...one wonders why he only solos on one tune--&quot;Moritat&quot;. But the star is Rollins, who is on fire from the word go. Clarity, coherence, speed, imagination and unpredictability are his weapons, and they make this probably the best saxophone record ever.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|Love this game
B003H4I4JU|5|What a great story teller!
B00QW8TYWO|5|Listen, It has so much characters that you can choose from! This game has so much detail and you have to dodge the cars. Almost like Frogger. :D
B00FAPF5U0|5|I really like this game, I feel relaxed and am able to concentrate on it, however II am presently on level 65 and have been for several months, I simply can not get thru that one.  However I am getting frustrated with the game because I can not get ahead. I have had several people try to help me, but they also could not do it.
B0067RQYNW|5|This app is very powerful, containing full functionality (like the desktop version). So, you can open and view your &#34;Office&#34; files, and you can also EDIT and format the files! This app works with Office 2003 and 2010 versions - I've tested it.
0375758992|5|God, I loved this book!  Smart, funny, sad... I love her writing style.  She makes you feel, smell, taste and touch Africa.  I wish I could write like this.  I'm recommending it to everyone I know, and hope that Fuller's latest, &quot;Scribbling the Cat,&quot; is as good.  Even if it's only half as good, it'll be worthwhile!
B00AESN8XY|5|At first I was like ,how much fun could this game really be. But after an hour went by I was hooked. I could not put it down. It's makes u use your  brain and each plaque has a different starting point. The zombie and mind control plaque are just awesome. I  can't wait for more updates.
B008XNZMOU|5|I chose this rating because I love her music, and this cd is great!<br />I like the fact that she is versatile in her songs and abilities, for instance, she doesn't always sound like country. Seems there is a bit of rock and roll in there too..<br />I highly recommend this cd to all who love country/rock and Taylor Swift...
159420229X|5|Whether you have memory problems (can't recall the name of someone you met a week ago?) or not, you're likely to improve your memory after reading this book. Even if you don't - but odds are you will - it makes for fascinating reading.<br /><br />It definitely was a major aid for me and I do think of it as a unique \\"self help\\" book, one that can have immediate results, helping to make life easier, alleviate tricky memory issues and more. I think it is important to disclose that I'm a Baby Boomer and my memory seems to have worsened with age. I used to recall the name of nearly everyone I met as well as both major and minor actors and actresses, all of my teachers (from kindergarten through high school) as well as the first and last names of every one of my high school classmates. I could recall even tiny details of books read long ago.<br /><br />But Moonwalking with Einstein goes far beyond remembering the names of acqaintances. It can help make your daily life easier, aiding you when you try to find lost items - or keep them from getting lost in the first place- and actually train you to find ways to improve your memory.<br /><br />For added fun, the author includes examples of people who have amazing abilities to recall things. I wondered if at least one of them could give Vegas a run for its money or even be banned from casinos. Although I don't plan to test my abilities in Vegas, I have been practicing in casual card games, with gratifying results. The surprised looks from friends and family members was worth the cost of the book.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend you give this one a try. The techniques can even be fun for a whole family to share - and test -together. And c'mon...how can you pass up a book which explores \\"the art and science of remembering everything\\"?
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I am now addicted to Downton Abbey! Couldn't stop watching the episodes. UK version much better than watching it on PBS in the States.
0792156684|4|Well, I have this movie on DVD. The movie was great, but they didn't have the film in Full Frame on DVD. So I had to watch it at a 2.85.1 Widescreen format. Also, there were no behind the scenes about how they made the movie Titanic. The only thing on this DVD was just the movie. I wish they would of put more interactive stuff on this DVD, or should of made a box set at lest. Disc One (Widescreen), Disc Two (Full Frame). So if you are a person who loves more than just a movie on DVD, don't count on getting it! You will only just get the movie in Widescreen format.
B00007KQA3|4|Excellent movie, Richard Burton and John Hurt delever top notch <br />performances, even though this movie is titled 1984, it is timeless, the sets are dark and moody, very reminisent of luftwaffa attacks in the WWII films that you see, In a day and  <br />age where our  civil rights are being disolved in the name of homeland security, this film hits more close to home than ever.
B00280LYIC|5|Wonderful book, loved every minute of it. Seen the movie many times. I am going to start the next one right now. I got all 5 for Christmas on my Kindle. Will get Kane Chronicles next!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5|well written book that holds your interest
B00834PFC8|2|I really love the series (five stars, over all) - much more enjoyable plots and characterizations<br />than the American take - Elementary…<br /><br />But, for me at least, The Hounds of Baskerville is the weakest episode of the first two seasons.<br />Gattis talks about being bedeviled by the difficulties posed by this particular adaptation, and, given the result,<br />it appears to have remained perplexing all the way through its conception and creation.<br />Just me, perhaps, but many threads seemed to be confusingly, &#34;befuddledly&#34; presented<br />(and not in the way a clever detective story strives for), with the eventual denouement lacking the complexity and<br />amazing insight we expect of Sherlock…not so much 'magically revealed', more 'explained' than 'experienced', perhaps?<br /><br />And please, Mr. Gattis, I can understand how this plays to your own life, but are we really to believe,<br />episode after episode,<br />scene after scene,<br />that every  single introduction, every relationship, every innuendo in England involves the requirement<br />that any and every two men presented, must be obliquely 'suspected' of being gay?<br />Here in California, I saw two men talking the other day at Starbucks, and, I'm pretty sure,<br />nobody even wondered about it!<br />Miraculous!  Inconceivable!  Conundrum!<br /><br />Anyway, new season in a few weeks…can't wait!!!
B00MWD7XR6|5|Excellent.  I loved the other two but enjoyed this one the most.
B007SYWFRM|3|so I downloaded game started playing and instantly I'm addicted!!! spent hours playing then all of a sudden it crashes. when I try to reopen game it just crashes before finishing its download process. extremely disappointing I had a beautiful village and lots of paid for acorns.I love the game but what's love got to do with it if you cant play it! :(
B0054JZC6E|4|its a pretty good app in my opinion and I think that anybody should download it and if you don't like ot then just delete it I mean it is free
B000FA675C|5|Excellent thinking story line. Characters felt real as did the subject matter. Mixing history with fiction gave it that extra punch to keep me reading and question it's many possibilities. A keeper to read over and over.
B008P9M614|5|i will enjoying it for sure i been watching before will enjoy it during i am retired and house id good
B00DJFIMW6|5|My 4-1/2 year old loves this game and so do I.  I would recommend it to anyone.  What a great game.
B00006AFUR|5|If you're expecting to hear the same drab rock music you hear everywhere today, then you're in for a suprise with 30 Seconds to Mars. Yea, sure, a lot of times when an actor attempts to start a band, they fail miserably..but that is not the case with this band folks. <BR>Front man Jared Leto (also guitarist) has astounding vocals. His voice is almost mesmerizing, fitting perfectly with the music, created by the highly talented Solon Bixler (guitar), Matt Wachter (bass), and Jared's brother Shannon Leto (drums). <BR>Their sound is like no other that I've heard. Atmosphereic, yet heavy, relaxing, yet energizing, with lyrics just as intense as the music, taking you on ride that never gets boring.
0679805273|5|My MIL is a preschool teacher. She gave me the idea of having each of your child's teachers sign the book at some place at the end of each year. You then present the book to the child when they graduate high school. We loved the idea, so we bought a book for each of our 3 kids and got started w our kindergartener this year :)
B00005BL2A|5|This album is a little different than their other cds, and more mellow, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing.  My favorite DM cd's are Black Celebration and Violator, but Exciter is also a beautiful album.  It was nice because it was positive, relaxing, and gorgeous.  It has uplifting messages, and Martin Gore is quite a poet.  Dave sounds great as usual, and the music is good too.  Since DM are geniuses, anything they put out is gonna be good.  Cheers to the best band in the history of music. (past, present, future).
B00000DG1R|5|For those of you who just want an overview of Duran Duran without buying every album they ever did, this is the cd you should purchase.  All of the songs kick butt, and they are Duran Duran essentials.  Give em a listen.  My personal fav is \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\".
B009SJ3H8Q|4|I'm hooked!
B002MQYOFW|5|Great start to finish.  I can it wait to begin reading the  second<br />Installment of this series of books. Wow
B001DF68MA|5|Our daughter loves this thing.  always giggling.    The only Con for this item are the harness straps which never really stay in place -- i feel it could ahve been fixed if they had a car seat style 3 point harness.  but kiddo loves riding around.
B00GY0HJ4K|4|A game that starts out easy but gets more challenging as it goes.  So far it has not left me stuck at a level for eons.  To do well you definitely need to think and use strategy.
1573225517|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00002Z88D|5|This was an awesome.  Probably the best one yet.  Not only did they do excellent songs but the orchestra helped add to the awesome effect of the songs.  It added a certain mood that a guitar cant add.  I loved the CD,  especially the 2 new songs.  I really think any true Metallica fan would  love the CD and its a great CD to add to a collection.  Even though it's an  orchestra they still come through with the hard hitting power chords and  fast guitar riffs as the Old Metallica from the Master of Puppet days.
B009ZQC7MY|4|Riveting show!
B00KA7JIII|5|Minimalistic and well done with creative and satisfying puzzles. At its essence is what a game should be, entertaining and fun.
B00VFTCGES|5|After watching I couldn't stop thinking about it! Great performances by all!
B000000W3G|5|TO SAY THAT THIS BOX SET IS ESSENTIAL TO ANY SP FAN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!  THERE IS A SONG HERE FOR EVERY TYPE OF LISTENING PLEASURE.  SOME OF THE BEST SP'S SONGS ARE HERE!  I CANNOT PRAISE THIS PRODUCT ENOUGH!!!
0393057658|4|This book was my introduction to sabermetrics, and proved to be quite a thrilling introduction. The application of truly smart statistical work the game of baseball in Billy Beane and the Oakland A's had me hooked from page one. Great material.<br /><br />It did seem to drag on a little, however. The first half of the book was thrilling. The end started to feel like more of the same old same old. But it's still worth finishing.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Loved this movie. Never been big on the girly &#34;I want to be a princess.&#34; But now at almost 40 I wanna be Queen Elsa! Even my two boys watch it with me!

0736041850|5|I happen to stumble upon this book while browsing my local bookstore, but it's completely changed my workout.  I've been lifting for a while, but I never completely understood exactly which muscles were being worked with each exercise.  Now with the information in this book I've been able to create a much more balanced workout allowing me to make more progress in less time.

B00006F7S4|5|In the world of Beck, change is a way of life. He's covered pretty much every major genre over the course of his career and never seems to miss a beat. And, for me, there's always something to like about whatever Beck's doing, although not everyone probably feels the same. He's been knocked because of his many times ironic lyrics or for the fact that he seems to change his musical arena every few years; he says he makes whatever kind of record that everyone else isn't making, which is probably the most true. Alas, Beck was supposed to making a rock record, but that's nothing like the Beck we get this time. This is sad, melancholy Beck, and very straightforward, truthful Beck and I got to admit I like this Beck as much, or more, than the previous ones.<br />'Sea Change' is pretty much in it's entirety full of glum musings concerning the breakup he experienced with his long-time girlfriend. Of course, song titles like &quot;Guess I'm Doin' Fine,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Tears,&quot; &quot;Lost Cause,&quot; and &quot;Already Dead&quot; kind of lead you to fact that this record probably isn't all that perky. The thing that for me really amplifies this to a very touching sadness is the way Beck delivers his vocals with a somber, heartfelt tone that really shows depth which maybe wasn't there before on previous records. Overall, it's really quite melodic and beautiful.<br />This record is kind of a sibling record of 1998's 'Mutations' in that it's basically acoustic oriented. Another similarity to the record is that Nigel Godrich is back as the producer and wraps Beck's sound in a nice array of strings, effects, and bleeps that keep each song fresh and adds an uplifting vibe in Beck's bare somber tones . On songs such as &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; and &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, Godrich layers a orchestrations that really make the song sound complete and make songs that could have ended up somewhat ordinary, extraordinary. Throughout the record it seems that Beck and Godrich were able to decipher what each song needed to compliment Beck's voice and guitar, such as the effects on &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, or if the song needed anything at all (&quot;Already Dead&quot;).<br />Is this Beck's best record yet? Possibly, and I'm really beginning to think it may be. This album is both immediately accessible and able to grow to display depth on further listens. All in all, he's created what may be the ultimate breakup record with it's themes of loss and sadness, but with a feeling of moving forward and letting the past be the past.e able to decipher what each song needed to compliment Beck's voice and guitar, such as the effects on &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, or if the song needed anything at all (&quot;Already Dead&quot;).<br />Is this Beck's best record yet?

B003K1EYM6|5|I love the product except the USB part only for camera.  I was thinking to return it but I decide to keep it.  Thanks so much!
0307473473|4|I really liked this book and thought that it has a very good hook, a solid plot line, and strong character development. I enjoyed the last 2/3 of the book very much and found myself reading it much faster and with more vigor than I normally read books. However, there are two reasons that I gave this book four stars instead of five. First of all, the first 150 pages leave much to be desired. There is very little in the beginning of the book that really gives the reader an idea of what the book is going to be about or what the REAL heart of the story is. Additionally, the family lineage is overbearing, and I had to continuously look at the family chart to remember how the characters were related. Eventually you pick up the characters and realize who is important and who is forgettable, but at the same time, it is something that provides a bit of a slip up to the reader. I would still definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested and I have already purchased the second in the series to begin.
B000BYA4JM|5|Why has it taken so long for Who's That Girl to make it to DVD?? My roommate has this movie on Laser Disc.  The quality of the laser disc doesn't give this movie justice, nor VHS.  I prefer it as widescreen DVD. Eitherway, for the year this movie came out, it's one of the best entertaining films.  If you want a fun movie to watch, then get this one.   <br />Madonna does best when she's having fun. All her films are great except for a few, but who cares.  When she's doing comedy, she's hilarious. Her role on Will and Grace proves how great she is when she's doing comedy.  Why can't she do more like these? I love her work regardless and Who's that Girl soundtrack is just as great and fun as the movie.   <br />I totally recommend this movie to everyone.
B0041I0N9A|5|I don´t know who loves much more this \\"toy\\"? My son or...? It´s a toy, but it´s a model too!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great book. As a college student I have little time to read for pleasure during the semester. This great story hooked me and held my attention a lot longer than I should have allowed. I read the first two books immediatly. Catching Fire, the final book in the series, couldn't come out soon enough!
B00AIQP9DE|4|Interesting story and game play.  I really enjoyed.  Flow of the game was so good did not want to stop playing.  I especially liked the extra game play.
B007FEFLTO|4|Very solid read. It lulls at the beginning but picks up and then you can't wait to read what comes next.
B00CWY76CC|4|Free and fun to play with your kids.  What else can you ask for.  I would recommend this application to others.
B007THA4FI|4|Does Ms Rowling lilke people? The characters were well developed but thoroughly icky. The kids were worse than the parents and the parents were pretty nasty.<br />Unlike Elizabeth George, who wrote a similar book, Ms Rowling has very little compassion for her characters.<br />By the end of the book I felt bludgeoned by the plot. I will read the next novel just to Se if she is still mad at humans.

0446563048|5|As someone very interested in business and technology I did enjoy this book for Tony's story on how he made Zappos what it is today: one of Fortune  magazine's top 25 companies to work for. But I also enjoyed it because of the personal story he tells about his pursuit for happiness. In his case it is to spread the word of HAPPINESS, which he does through his company, his friendships, and now this book. I learned some valuable lessons from Tony's, and many of his friends, words in this book.
B00IG2DOKM|4|pretty good
B000002OMN|5|It's not often that we regress into our former selves. Sometimes you need a reminder of where you've been to relate to where you are now. The lyrics of this album created a mental time warp. With tracks like \\"Wasted Youth\\" and \\"Rock ans Roll Dreams Come Thru\\" as another song states \\"It's all coming back to me now\\". Meat Loaf, after a 20 year gap, still has the power with the stong Steinman lyrics to touch a nerve that is now a fond memory, versus the reality of when I owned this on cassette and played it 'til the tape shot out of the dashboard. Great album! Stands up to the test of time with its operatic scope. I recommend it to anyone who is \\"just another case of arrested development, another case of wasted youth\\". It takes me back so I can move ahead...\\"wasted youth IS better by far,than as wise and constructive old age\\". Enjoy!
B00G32OER4|4|loved it
0375703764|5|reading it now...liking it... should be successful tome...started at the beginning and I am about 100 pages into it so
B0089EHWQE|4|At first, I thought this was just a well-written piece of fluff, but it was actually a complex story with a perfect pace and adept character development. I recommend it to those who enjoy easy to read stories with substance. Well done, Ms. Moyes.

Once in residence in a squalid tenement, they begin a new life together with high hopes and great expectations, although haunted by the death of a toddler. That loss presumably motivated Sarah (Samantha Morton) and Johnny (Paddy Considine) to make a fresh start in a strange city where so many other immigrant families have also done so for more than a century. Johnny is an aspiring actor whose ambitions are endured by his generally sullen wife. It soon becomes obvious that Sarah and (especially) Johnny are ill-prepared for the responsibilities of parenthood. Violent crime as well as alcohol and drug abuse surround the Sullivans where they live and yet the two daughters are often allowed to roam around unsupervised.<br />Over time, the Sullivans become friends with Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), a neighbor in the tenement who eventually provides unexpected assistance when it is needed most. (The nature of that assistance is best revealed in the film.) Frankly, I still do not know what to make of the relationship between Mateo and the Sullivans. The friendship they share was more a distraction than a revelation as I struggled to understand Sheridan's purposes. Unlike Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, for example, Mateo seems a contrivance.<br />Having seen four films which Sheridan previously directed -- My Left Foot (1989), The Field (1990), In the Name of the Father (1993), and The Boxer (1997) -- I admire so much what he has contributed to our understanding of the courage and determination which many of his characters somehow summon in response to severe hardship. They evince an integrity lacking in the adult characters in this film, with the possible exception of Mateo. As indicated, there are several reasons for my disappointment in In America. Nonetheless, the performances by Hounsou and the Bolger sisters almost -- not quite -- elevate this film above the inadequacies of its  narrative (i.e. gritty realities awkwardly juxtaposed with fantasy) as well as the disturbing questions raised about the Sullivans as parents.- not quite -- elevate this film above the inadequacies of its  narrative (i.e. gritty realities awkwardly juxtaposed with fantasy) as well as the disturbing questions raised about the Sullivans as parents.

B00IK590UI|3|The action was good, but things happened so fast it was hard to follow. The plot was a little weak, I think.
B0000AQS0F|5|Wish there was more to this series. Wish they would somehow learn to start it up again. Wish for the same writing, the same actors, the same insights into human living. Wish for anything as entertaining and filled with such thought <br />and emotional strength. Wish for something as unassumingly wise, down home <br />warm.Loved the dvd set. Play it again and again. And will continue to. <br />Wish there were new episodes.

The graphics are fun, the quotes are pithy, and playing is easy and engaging. Unfortunately, I did end my game with a crash. I look forward to an update and many more hours of gameplay.

O bummer continues the 911 LIE,sends more troops to a so called war(occupation)continues to bomb a third country nearby(Pakistan)and who knows where else.Continues to let these Blackwater scumbuckets run loose over there(killing civilians).  The reality one year and 2 months into his presidency is a Dick Cheney continuance. To you who may buy this Deceptions book- Google- 911 blueprint for truth presented by Architect Richard Gage. Take some time and watch his presentation of the clear evidence for demolitions on the 3 buildings on 911. When you realize the truth-you may feel ill when you hear O Crock say Alcaeda attacked us on 911. You will also realize Obama himself is just another Illusion. He is not real.

0131103628|5|I've been using this book on and off for an entire semester now.  This book is a great reference to get exposed to all the basic constructs and functionality of the C language.  Sometimes the author's code examples are a bit esoteric, but can be deciphered with some effort.  Overall I would recommend this book as supplementary reading to anyone that is learning the C programming language.  It also seems like it would be a quick, handy reference for those who may not use the language day to day.
B000WC39SG|5|Good show
1400052181|5|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is a story long overdue.  In parts, it was fascinating, heartbreaking, outrageous and frightening--but ultimately uplifting.  Skloot's book is actually several different stories, and she weaves them together seamlessly.  There is the story of Henrietta Lacks, her family, her cells and the ethics involved in medical research.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a 30 year-old black woman when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951.  Living in Baltimore with her husband and 5 children, she sought treatment at Johns Hopkins University Hospital.  She died 9 months later.  Before her death, her doctor took samples of her cells--both normal and cancerous.  The cells were given to Hopkins researcher, Dr. George O. Gey.  Gey was not only able to keep the cancerous cells alive, but they actually started reproducing--the first time this was seen in human cells.  Gey was generous with these cells and before long, researchers from all over the world were using Henrietta's cells (now called HeLa) for research.  Many scientists claim that HeLa cells were the most important medical breakthrough in the 20th Century.<br /><br />Over the years, HeLa cells \\"helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers.\\"  They've been exposed to radiation, and used to test \\"steroids, chemotherapy drugs, hormones, vitamins, and environmental stress...\\"  They've been sent into space and used to test cosmetics.  They've been used to study genetics, they've been cloned, and they were used to create hybrids.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office lists over 17,000 patents using HeLa.  Today, HeLa cells have evolved into a multibillion dollar business.<br /><br />It wasn't until over 20 years after Henrietta's death that her family became aware that her cells were still alive, being used for research and making companies lots of money.  When the author was 16, her science teacher introduced Skloot to Henrietta Lacks and her cells, although he didn't know much about Henrietta.  So Skloot decided that Henrietta's story needed to be told.  But Henrietta's family had major reservations about Skloot and her motives and at first, refused to work with her.  \\"It's not only the story of HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks, but of Henrietta's family--particularly Deborah [daughter]--and their lifelong struggle to make peace with the existence of those cells, and the science that made them possible.\\"  It also seems terribly wrong to them that while many have become rich off their mother, they are poor, uninsured, and can't afford the drugs that were most likely created using HeLa cells.<br /><br />The Immortal Life also deals with medical ethics, consent, medical experiments on humans, cell ownership, and who has a right to profit from your cells.  The tissues taken from Henrietta were taken without her consent.  Some of her cancer cells were injected into unknowing patients in medical experiments.  There have been gains made over the years to protect patients, but there is always a battle between patients and researchers when changes are proposed.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a book that will haunt you long after you're done.

B005LAIGRS|5|I ordered this movie for my husband he enjoyed  watching it I saw a little bit of the movie I will watch the movie again
B007THA4FI|1|I wanted so much to like it, but page after page brought out new characters whom I would not like in real life, treating everyone around them badly, spewing venom,...every page full of bad feeling....who reads books populated with unlikeable people being despicacble? Worse,,  reviewers saying 'we all know people just like them?' I don't know people like them, thank God! And for all the times I have used language that would make my mother blanch (followed here by a comment which Amazom would not approve for publication,  though the book is riddled with far worse than what I said) after the first three chapters of this book, I had had enough of being splattered with a verbal buffet of offensiveness. If this were a hardcover edition, it would be thrown out the window with great force: being an eBook, however, I intend to smoosh my finger on that 'delete this piece of refuse' X with great satisfaction and move on to something with redeeming value.<br />For the record, if J.K. Rowling were to read this review, it is not possible that she could feel worse than I did in feeling the need to write it.
B00C3MKCIS|5|Like the millions of old school Genesis fans out here in the world, I was pleasantly surprised when Phil stepped up to the mike after Peter left and did an amazing job of carrying on the vocal duties(see &#34;Mad Man Moon&#34; from Trick of the Tail). When I came across Simon Collins' &#34;Dimensionaut&#34; on Amazon, I decided I would check it out and see if the comparisons to his old man were accurate. I can absolutely verify that indeed Simon is ,as they say, &#34;A chip off the old block&#34;. Not only that...imagine combining the drumming and vocal talents of a younger version of Phil Collins with the sonic majestic-force of Steven Wilson and Porcupine Tree and this is pretty much what you get, heck there's even one track on the album where he affects a bit of a Peter Gabriel sound complete with pizzicato strings. All said, I am very glad to have purchased the album, it is top notch from start to finish with excellent production through out. Old school fans of Phil should buy this album and rejoice at the second coming!

B006LSZECO|4|I'm a fan of books that emphasize personal interactions and relationships.  Not only that, but the best books are those that provide unique insights into personalities and relationships.  I've read dozens (hundreds?) of books that focus on these themes, many of them quite good, but relatively few that provide sheer shock value.  \\"Gone Girl\\" falls into the \\"shock\\" category.  My first thought, after completing the book, was that I'd never encountered someone like Amy, but on second thought I realized I knew someone just like her, so her personality wasn't an author's fantasy.  I'm treading on thin ice here, as I don't want to be accused of providing a plot spoiler.  So I'll have to leave it at that.    Speaking of plot spoilers, I'm sometimes irritated by extravagantly long, specific reviews that give a blow-by-blow account of an entire book.  I know, I know.  If I want to read a book with no preconceived notions, the solution is not to search the reviews.  But I can't resist (and actually rely on) sampling a few before deciding to buy and read any book.  Some reviewers may think that so long as they don't tell what's on the final 3.5 pages, they aren't really revealing the plot.  But I think the plot of any fiction work begins on page one, then continues to evolve.  In this case, a number of reviewers said they didn't like the ending.  I'm sorry I read those comments, as they caused me to contemplate, as I read the last third of the book, what the egregious ending might be.  I would rather have sailed along and been surprised by the final twist.  (Now I'm in league with all those who show but not tell.)  :-)    Murder, marriage, childhood, coming of age -  always valid subjects for enjoyable reading, especially if the author gives the reader something special to think about.  \\"Gone Girl\\" definitely gives the reader plenty of food for thought.  A marriage in trouble is a common theme, but the Nick/Amy marriage is something else.  It leads to the question:  How well can one ever know another person?  Never having been married, I certainly can't pontificate on that subject as related to couples.  I do wonder, though, how many marriages survive 20, 30, 40, 50 years with the two parties still getting along, and even if they still survive the 50% divorce rate, do they get to know one another any better over time?  As I apply that question to my own relationship to friends and relatives, I must admit that knowing someone very well can sometimes lead to areas of discord.  How well do I actually know this person?  How well does s/he know me?  Well, I don't think anyone can know the whole \\"me.\\"  Perhaps I can't even know myself.  If that sounds off the subject of a review, my answer is that \\"Gone Girl\\" gave me the impetus to think about such things, for which it deserves a 4.5-star rating.

B00003OSU4|5|See title of review.Also considered a landmark in documentary fil making in and of itself.  Chazz
0767834739|5|While I felt the first and third movies in this trilogy were entirely average, this second part of the trilogy is nothing short of excellent. Here's why.    This movie breaks the mold of survival horror movies. The usual formula places a group of characters together and kills them off one at a time over the course of the movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the story progression is much more open ended. We follow the stories of several different groups of characters in different parts of a city sealed off from the outside world to contain the outbreak of a virus. While many characters do die, in this case, it is happpening to unique groups of people all making their own way to survive in a city over-run by zombies. Their storylines eventually converge of course, but the storyboarding developed to bring about this connection is stellar. As icing on the cake, all of these characters feel excellently cast and developed.    There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup.     The directing and set design are also excellent. This movie feels like a horror movie whereas the other two simply pass as alright action movies. The sets are intricately designed, with the very smallest attention to detail throughout. They are dark, filled with well placed streams of light and shadow, and dirty looking, in direct opposition to the clean, slick nature of the first movie. Everything really feels much closer to what the games envisioned in this outing. The directing is outstanding, filled with inspired camera angels, and the knowledge that true horror does not come from throwing scary beasts at us, but through the unknown about any scenario. The church scene is particularily inspired, giving us only the smallest glimpse of three attackers stalking the characters being portrayed. The level of suspense is masterfully built slowly to aclimax around wonderful camera angels and the mood of the set. It is also no wonder why the acting in the movie feels so superb as well. It may not be the stuff of oscars, but it is outstanding by action/horror standards. A great director can bring out the best talent from their actors and actresses. Another classic scene portrays frantic citizens of Racoon city trying to leave through the one exit in the barrier surrounding the city until one man at the front of the line succumbs to infection and the exit is shut tight for good.    Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an A grade movie, and by far the best of the series. If only all three were this good, and the director of this movie had been brought back for the third installment. It isn't a perfect film, but it is excellent in all the most important places. If you only buy or see one movie out of this trilogy, see this one. It is expertly crafted.
B000001G1E|5|The word &quot;essential&quot; is used alot in regard to records, but here it fits the bill and then some: it belongs in anyone's collection. I especially enjoyed hearing full-length versions of &quot;Let Yourself  Go&quot;, &quot;Bring It Up&quot;, &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;, and  &quot;Papa's...Bag&quot;; the pre-edit &quot;Money Won't Change You&quot;;  and the prev. unrel. tracks from '68 and '71. However, I was disappointed  to note that some notable JB non-hits like &quot;Georgia..&quot; and  &quot;If If I Ruled The World&quot;, two concert staples, were omitted, and  could have fit in if some long tracks had been used in &quot;Part One&quot;  form.

B0014JGDUC|4|Should have tried on in store first
B002EB439W|3|Great special effects and some humor
B0027MJU00|5|I love dark stories with what others might consider (and have described in other reviews here as) unlikeable characters. I actually did like all of the characters; most of them had at least one redeeming quality that I could identify with, and those who didn't (Diondra, Runner and Trey) were still entertaining and were of course integral to the story.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but spoilers ahead:<br /><br />The story starts in the present with the main character, Libby, learning that she is almost out of money that she received over the years as a charity case due to being the only surviving member of the gruesome murder of the rest of her family by her oldest brother twenty five years earlier. Just in the nick of time, she is approached by a member of a group of people who are fans of murder cases, and don't believe it was her brother who did it, and are willing to pay her to investigate the truth. Most of the members of the group are initially hostile towards Libby, since they are sympathetic towards her brother and it was her testimony that put him in prison.<br /><br />Each chapter alternates between different characters in the past on the day of the murder, and present day Libby as she progresses in her investigation over the course of what must be several weeks. She is very flawed; sarcastic, not friendly, she steals inexpensive things for no real reason other than she wants to at the time... but she's somehow also honest and open to these experiences that she's been avoiding for so long. I enjoyed her voice.<br /><br />Others have stated that the coincidences that culminate in the novel's climax are hard to believe or accept; I disagree. It is fiction, so we can agree that it didn't really happen, but coincidences do indeed happen all the time and I can accept this ending with no problem. I think the author did a great job.<br /><br />This is in no way a &#34;feel good&#34; book. There is violence, and hate, and deadbeats, so if you really don't like that sort of thing, then this book isn't for you. However, it does have a very clear ending and the &#34;right thing&#34; happens (unlike the somewhat open endings of her other two books, which I also loved).<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is a talented writer, great descriptive language, believable dialogue, and a creative story-teller.

B007IXWKUK|1|This will be a bit all over the place (much like this terrible, terrible book). I have to say that I wondered what could be worse than Fifty Shades of Grey, since I consider it to be the worst book I've ever read - until this piece of crap. Reading Fifty Shades does not even begin to prepare you for the places this one goes. If there was anything remotely sexy or intimidating about Christian Grey in the first book, EL James has efficiently emasculated him in this one turning him from a sick twisted sex God sex freak into a ridiculous lapdog for the single most repugnant and revolting female character ever created - Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />I know that she's supposed to be Bella Swan from Twilight and Christian Grey is the sexed-up non-vampire version of Edward Cullen. It's not even thinly veiled in the first book and follows along here in the second, with a few sundry plot points standing in for vampire hoo-ha in the Twilight books.<br /><br />Previously I had despised Bella Swan as the most ridiculous female character ever written but Anastasia is a master-class in making every sane human being who has the misfortune of reading this bile want to have her erased out of fictional existence.<br /><br />She is loathsome, incredibly stupid, narcissistic, whiny, passive-aggressive, unlikable, rude, crass in her inner language to an extreme (like perhaps a 13 year old from the wrong side of the tracks might be), unfunny, unsexy, uncharming, un-freaking-everything. She won't eat anything and constantly has to be reminded (what is that crap EL James? You are an ample woman yourself, did you think if we read this in your book we would not notice? Why would you make a character anorexic? It's not you for crying out loud lady - your like thirty five years older or more than this character - get over yourself with your ridiculous wish fulfillment - don't subject the masses to your food/eating disorder issues or fantasies), she has no hopes, dreams, aspirations of any kind, no plans - nothing except what has to do with Christian Grey and his sexing and possible torment/torture/abuse of her. She has no backbone, she's not even a cardboard cut-out or placeholder character, there simply is not enough substance for that. She does NOTHING in both books but react and sometimes not even that. She is a whisper (or in this case a freaking MURMUR) of meaningless repetition who orgasms constantly at the drop of a hat. (seriously supposedly only 1/3 of women can orgasm from sex and I suspect the ones who claim this are freaking lying) Picture a blow-up doll for Christian Grey to have sex with and congratulations you have just created a more animate and substantial character than EL James has.<br /><br />Christian Grey loses his sexy mojo in this book. He only wants to please Ana and love her and marry her, give her money give her orgasms and no longer wants to shame, beat, humiliate, cane, whip and torture her anymore because ummmm...she didn't like being beat with a belt in the last book and left him for a whole five days! ( I wish I had known of this trick in dealing with complicated men who have personality disorders! But then I am no Anastasia Steele!)<br /><br />This puts Christian right in his billionaire place and he throws out the contract, the NDA, the canes, says he won't use the red room of pain anymore and wants to go straight vanilla sex unless Ana wants or asks for dirty rude BDSM stuff then he will happily oblige with clamps and a metal device that rhymes with nutt-jug. Whatta guy! But this is only if SHE wants it. Because he loves her so much and she is so precious and beautiful to him (unlike the fifteen women before her) that she has cured him of his self-abhorrence, his inability to be touched and his deviant sexual practices. Even his shrink tells her she has done more for him than he has with all his degrees and being a highly paid psychiatrist and treating him in therapy for many years.<br /><br />There is simply nothing thatAnastasia Steele cannot do. She is the most beautiful GODDESS (she is called this by Christian) ever to exist and this is proven time and time again by every single man falling under her spell and wanting to get into her panties (as Christian so tactfully says) and she is completely unaware of her dazzling and epic beauty and must be told this by every single man she interacts with. Her boss wants to blackmail her into a sexual relationship with him. Her closest male friend (the Jacob character), various and sundry other characters, brothers, fathers, the shrink - every man goes to pieces in her presence but non more than Christian Grey who has never had sex with anyone as perfect, orgasmic, stunning, awe-inspiring, talented, beautiful (again, why not, her beauty cannot be described it must be repeated), brave, courageous, smart, compassionate, tender, loving, liberated, strong, world-saving, pure and worthy than Anastasia.<br /><br />He cannot do enough for her. He saves her from a gun-wielding ex-submissive who has gone crackers and then from her lecherous boss (whom he fires since he bought the small publishing house to keep tabs on Ana). He buys her a number of different cars. He put $50K into her bank account. He buys her a multi-million dollar house and property on the water in Seattle. He buys her clothes,a giant diamond, electronics, flowers, anything and everything her heart desires (which is nothing because all she wants is him and she has no interest in his money which is what he loves about her). He even gets rid of Elena, his only friend (who was the older woman friend of his mothers who originally made him her submissive at fifteen years old) because Ana doesn't like her.<br /><br />He's known Elena 13 years.

It's the vanilla mommy porn interpretation nothing more and it is repetitive to a nauseating degree where I ended up thumbing past the sex scenes because they were dull and boring and hearing about Christian Grey's (rhymes with defection) was mind-numbing beyond belief. EL James never even refers to his manhood, never calls it what it is but we get to hear about every bit of Ana's anatomy in lurid detail. I've read sexier historical romances from the eighties that at least weren't afraid to call manhood, manhood. Good heavens.<br /><br />And Christian Grey has no (rhymes with smalls) either.

Especially in erotica.<br /><br />I'm truly sorry for the millions of women who purchased this book and read it and think that this is hot or romantic in any way.This is sick and twisted stuff relationship-wise, abusive, not loving  and it frightens me to think that young impressionable girls will read this (the way the Twilight series scared me too) thinking that this is the kind of relationship to have with a man.<br /><br />But more than that what frightens me is that a real publisher published these books. And without an editor. Because people are that dumb, I guess, the masses, that is, they are that disturbingly stupid that this kind of crap sells (Fifty Shades has sold over 100 million copies). It makes me physically ill and I have lost my faith in humanity. Fortunately I got my money back. Thanks Amazon.Anastasia Steele cannot do.

0763644765|5|Super helpful! Great illustrations!
B0017SWPXY|5|A very unique story...I loved it.<br />Enzo was a real person inside. Very insightful for a beloved pet.<br />You'll want to share this one with all your friends.
B0054JZC6E|4|i like the game. its fun and some of the games are challenging, point wise. mildly addicting i would recommend for when u get bored
B00R2LZ41K|2|Longer than it needed to be.  Not entirely clear who the five armies were (dwarves, elves, humans, orcs, and ????)  Nice to see some of the characters from LOTR again.  Unclear how all the orcs were finally defeated once the focus shifted to the dwarves battling the orcs in the north.  2 stars but don't think I will watch again.
140053271X|1|Yet I did' get the Item
B005I64U5C|4|I liked it. Not sure why TV plays it every day
B00004BZ0N|5|Jack Black spouts this in the recent film, 'School of Rock', as he sees school kids taking over a bus, and it's funny to many people, but some may scratch their heads. Why? Simply because the image of punk rock today is so distorted. It's albums like this where you really see how trashed the name punk became and what the hell IS punk rock.<br />'London Calling' is a vertebrae for all that is different in the genre so aptly labeled, punk. It has a melodic rock sound, it has reggae/rhythmic vibes, and it's definitely not the same each time around. Strummer Inc. made something that was basically a road sign that took you off the main highway. From the title track forward, the album is a raw slam with lessons and literature.<br />From 'Guns of Brixton' to 'Rudie Can't Fail', I mean, where do you not see difference? When everyone mentions punk and the godfathers behind it, they never mention Bowie, The Who, or even Cash, they always mention the now brothers and siblings of punk, Ramones and Sex Pistols. What makes The Clash so different from them is that this isn't the usual taste of punk, it's rock and roll daring to be different...which is what punk is in general. If everyone's wearing greasy hair, the kid with the hat is more punk rock than the bar chords of today.<br />See that's why 'London Calling' is so exceptional. It's such a farce in today's standards that punk rock is the ridiculous truckers' hats sideways and the shorts all mocked up;in actuality it's a fad that everyone does, contradicting what it is! It's laughable if you know where I'm coming from. In conclusion, punk rock is rare...and it's certainly not what it's called today. You want originality, theory, and difference? 'London Calling' is, no pun intended, your calling.<br />Exceptional is an understatement.
1582701709|1|This material is as old as the hills, though some of it IS very useful. I would suggest you read 3 Magic Words, (also available on Amazon) written in 1952 by U. S. Aunderson. Many of the passages in this book look suspiciously like exact extracts from his book with a slight rearrangement of the words.    Again, let me stress, positive thinking IS a fine thing but when your health goes south in a serious way, go to a doctor or the only thing you're going to be attracting is an undertaker. I found that out the hard way!    I recommend you buy 3 Magic Words instead. As a side bonus, that book gives you the only plausible explanation I've heard of what God may be like or doing with the Universe -- just a theoretical concept not a religion -- but it has the extra bonus of curing you of Christianity (if you need it, which I didn't) as he thoroughly and simply debunks the concepts of heaven and hell and a loving God overseeing a world full of misery and suffering.     I suggest reading it when you need it, when you've bottomed out, and are willing to pay attention to his philosophy and trying his interesting 30-day mental diet-- an incredibly simple exercise that turns out to be extremely difficult to do.
B007WFR1MQ|4|This album is 4 stars because most of the songs are listenable. I really enjoy listening to this album.<br />I highly recommend this album. Addy.
B000002B2X|4|Although Sap has \\"4\\" songs on it, (i put quotes around four beacause there is a bonus song \\"love song\\"), its one of the best cds i've ever heard.<br />My only problem with Sap is the fact that the production isnt that good. The instruments could be turned up just a tad. But oh well. <br />Sap has 2 of my all time favorite Alice Songs<br />Brother: Arguably Alice's best song. I LOVE THIS SONG. I would recommend anyone buy this cd just for this song. The only thing better than this version is the unplugged version (where jerry's vocal skills are nigh perfect). <br />Got me Wrong: Not one of my favorite Alice songs, but it will grow on you. Especially what jerry does with the guitars during the chorus. <br />Right turn: Another of my Favorite Alice songs. It features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and the Chris Cornell of the Mighty Soundgarden. Wow. I love this song. Whats not to love about Cornell, Arm, Jerry and Layne all singing? <br />Am I Inside: the darkest song on the album. Probably cuz layne wrote it. But whatever the reason, i dont like the guitars in this one, so its an okay selection. Listenable, but just as easily skipped. <br />Thats it for the official songs. If this were just Brother, Got me Wrong, and Right turn, i would give Sap 5 stars withouth hesitation, but Am i Inside is included. So deduction of one star.<br />If you dont have it already, you should purchase Jar of Flies along w/Sap. Its even better than Sap.
B000067G3C|5|Hotshot cops Keanu Reaves and Jeff Daniels race the clock to rescue helpless hostages from a mad bomber.  The title is well earned as this edge-of-your-seat thriller keeps the energy level at a constant high pace. From an elevator rigged to blow to the runaway bus, the bomber stays one step ahead in a fiendish game of cat and mouse. Highly recommend!
B0098VYKSA|4|Great acting, emjoyable movie and the streaming of the movie was excellent.  Great quality.I'd recommend this movie to anyone for a good time.
B00005B6C9|5|Happy with my order A1
B0000025P9|4|While definitly Toto's best work ever, this CD falls short of perfection by three or four tracks.  &quot;Rosanna,&quot; &quot;Make Believe&quot;, &quot;I won't Hold you Back&quot;, and &quot;Africa&quot; all excell, and are worth the hype.  &quot;Good For You&quot; and &quot;We Made It&quot; would be decent songs, but they are a bit too sugary for repeated listens. &quot;It's a feeling&quot; and &quot;Waiting for your love&quot; would be decent songs, but they sound a tad uninspired, especially when comparing them with such material as &quot;Rosanna&quot; and &quot;Africa.&quot; &quot;Afraid of Love&quot; and &quot;Lovers in the Night&quot; are just pure drek.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Really enjoyed this book.  It pulls you in to this other world that starts to seem believable...Twists and unexpected turns and good ending...go King!
B00005QGAZ|5|Look, iḿ not a big fan of POP music...Most of the POP music world TOTALLY sucks....but THRILLER, is way beyond the realms of the common pop music....itś like a perfect mix of Rock, Jazz, Soul, pop and dance music, all combined to create a REAL REAL classic album!!!!Michael Jackson is without any doubt the KING OF POP...His fantastic music talent create absurd HITS like the title track, BEAT IT, BILLIE JEAN, WANNA BE STARTIN SOMETHING, BABY BE MINE and THE GIRL IS MINE.....i totally recommend this MUSIC PEARL to everyone in the world!!!!!!Well done, Michael!!!!! THRILLER is a total classic!!!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!
B000PC0U1W|5|The movie brought many questions from my teenagers which is what I want. The quality of the DVD was great.
B004MC8CA2|5|Nexis 7<br />I love readng the Bible wherever I go. I downloaded four versions of the Bible as I like seeing a passage that catches my attention expressed in different ways. Being able to highlight and take notes makes it almost as good as having my nondigital Bible with me.
B00846REIS|5|Forget Fifty, Sylvia Day does it right! The sex scenes are fantastic, the characters are well developed, AND they deal with their relationship like actual adults instead of teenagers! Go figure.
B00EL8I8IS|5|The plot is plausible, lots of action.  some special effects are a little over the top.  Good entertainment for action fans.
B00CL66FEQ|5|Good
B00FEJIVRQ|3|Thats right I loved the first half of this movie up until the twist. After that it just does not work for me. It just lost me, i didnt mind the twist just hated what happened after it
B006RXQ27O|4|Mild language for the kids.  A comedy classic for anyone who enjoyed Loony Tunes when they were younger.  A lot of the same gags.
6305308659|3|&quot;Pleasantville&quot; is, superficially, about teenage fraternal twins who get sucked into a television set and into the world of the male twin's (Tobey Maguire of &quot;Cider House Rules&quot;) favorite 1950s  black-and-white TV show--a composite of many &quot;classic&quot; shows of the era.  Mom is the perfect housewife, Dad is clueless about anything other than going to work and being fed when he gets home, and the other characters are cardboard cutouts unaware of their own interests and desires.<br />Slowly but surely, the twins begin to subversively turn these characters on to these interests and desires--and in doing so, the characters come into color.  Particularly interesting is Jeff Daniels' character, the owner of the malt shop, who discovers his love for art and painting.<br />The movie takes a drastic turn in tone about halfway through, becoming a tract on racism and turning those who are different into the &quot;other&quot;.  Since the film is set in the late '50s, this is nice foreshadowing of how the counterculture would be viewed with suspicion in the '60s.<br />Fine acting all the way around, from Maguire and Reese Witherspoon (&quot;Election&quot;) as the teens, Daniels, and the brilliant Joan Allen and William H. Macy as the parents.<br />Uneven in tone, but a fascinating piece of work.  Not only is the film entertaining on a superficial level, but it is especially rewarding for those who follow the advice of the &quot;American Beauty&quot; tagline and take a closer look.
B005CRQ4OW|4|Well I think the book is good I think it's good for kids who are going to middle school next year like me and I was scared of it because people said it was a mean cruel place
B004742Y68|5|An oldie but a goodie!
0765318741|4|It's not very often that I read a book that isn't YA.  It's even more infrequent that I read a book that wasn't written in the last 2 years.  I Am Legend was first published in 1954...  So why did I pick it up?  Well, mostly because I really liked the movie, and that's mostly because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, if not my favorite.<br /><br />I Am Legend was certainly an interesting read.  Matheson did an amazing job of getting the reader to feel the emotions the main character is reading, loneliness, craziness, despair, determination.  The author has a fantastic understanding of basic human nature.<br /><br />I'd heard the book was quite a bit different than the movie, but I wasn't prepared for HOW different it would be!  Aside from the main character being on his own most of the time, nothing was the same.  I was really surprised when I realized the book was about vampires, not zombie like creepy creatures!  Don't even compare the two, just let them be their own separate awesome.<br /><br />For a book that is almost 60 years old, there really wasn't a whole lot that made it feel old.  Except for one word that was used... which starts with a \\"N\\" (I won't say more than that, it was offensive)... I wouldn't have guessed it was written so long ago.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you want something with a MC who isn't a teenager, but something still with paranormal elements.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars!
B000JMKQX0|5|I enjoyed this book and found the interview format very fitting.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to expect with the interview format, but Brooks does a great job of telling the story from beginning to end with this format.  Well done.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Spectacular character development; you will fall in love with the people in this story.  I could not put it down, yet I wished I could stay within the pages a bit longer when it was finished.
B006ATJXQW|5|I've read the whole series and its been one of the best series I have ever read and I'm very sad to see that it is ending. I can't wait to see the movie and I continue to telly friends to read this series.
B00DR0PDNE|3|The concept of the chromecast is too good to pass up at this price, but I have had difficulty with streaming starting and stopping and my router is directly next to my TV. The apps with the built in feature seem to work better than just streaming out of the chrome browser.
B00JH3S0AI|3|I don't mind artsy fartsy movies but I was like &#34;ok where are we going?&#34;
B005SFR7YE|5|Arrived in a timely manner.<br />As a music teacher I may show this in my classes as an example of a Broadway musical.
B0016B6ZKG|5|I LOVE THIS DONNA SUMMER CD AS I LOVE ALL OF HER MUSIC. SHE WILL BE TRUELY MISSED !!! SHE WAS SUCH A TALENTED ARTIST WITH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND LYRICS THAT REALLY TOUCHED YOU.
B00IMYZL2S|5|I enjoyed this and it Kept me entertained. Lots of action. This was as good as the first movie in this series.
B007EECSFA|5|Kate Morton never disappoints.  Each of her works pulls in the reader and keeps them there.  The Secret Keeper is no exception, in fact, it may be her best to date.  Having read all of her books, I knew to expect a twist at the end and boy did she deliver!
B00A8OXGXQ|5|Brilliant and wonderful movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5|Loved the entire three seasons of Downton Abbey.  Looking forward to season four.  Have shared DVD with my daughter and her family.
B00942X8PY|4|Very fun game for the short waiting moments such as train or bus.
B00T3DR56C|1|I was so happy to see another Bill Bryson book as they usually make me laugh out loud. This book is boring and there isn't much more I can say about it.
B003EY7IRC|5|This series was amazing!!
B000WDQMWU|4|I like this show so much.
0062215507|5|This is a must have! As a potterhead, it met my expectations.. The bonus material is absolutely beautiful!
B00026ZG10|5|Great movie.  Can watch it over and over.
B00F226E74|4|Let me say that I very much wanted to give this writing five stars. What ultimately swayed me against a perfect score was the middle of the book, weighed down by so much talk of chromosomes, nucleotides, and DNA processing. That is OK with me or someone with a scientific background, but I am afraid the average reader will be lost.The insights into Dr. Paabo's life and work were excellent, as was the political intrigue involved in obtaining valuable hominim bones for examination and tetsing. Besides the build-up of Neanderthal type finds, a very interesting development at the end of this piece was the finding and determination of the Denosovan types, as well as their place in genetic history and contribution. One hopes that this is not the last public examination of DNA tested human genealogies from Svante Paabo, as many more historical and evolutionary mysteries need to be solved. And yes, Homo Floriensis needs to be looked into!
0345404475|5|A classic beyond the mythical film Blade Runner. A must read for Sci-Fi fans.
B009KS4XRO|3|At first I loved the game.. but now it's ok. I've spend an ungodly amount of bingo credits trying to complete rooms with no luck. Also for no apparent reason I get kicked out of rooms.. loseing what I would have won and the credits to play the round.. I not 100% sure I'll be keeping this application.
B004J4WN0I|5|Right up there with the dresden files. If you like urban fantasy this book is a must read. I couldn't put it down likeable characters and a story that keeps moving from start to finish with no down time.
B00164CM46|5|Best movie
B00G32OMF8|5|Great cast. Great dialogue. Fun saga.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Fun , happy game! An enjoyable way to spend your time, clears away stress and always makes me smile. Not just for kids!
B004W4N55C|1|No worky on fancy new machine. It is indeed Crash tastic.
B00LIZG26C|4|GOOD . BUT MOTION SENSOR IS NOT SO GOOD
B004VMUS9G|5|This app is my all time favorite it lets me wake up to my music that I have on my Kindle Fire and I am proud to approve this app 100% so if u want to have an alarm for waking up to taking ur meds this is it
B00CWY76CC|5|A brilliant game that's addictive and keeps you wanting to get to the next level. Can't wait to try the next level
B009KS4XRO|5|It's a lot of fun. A bit time consuming and addictive but your bored time will be spent doing something.
B00AJAFNIA|4|The game pulls you in fast and before you know the hours have flown by!!!!!!  And it is for children and adults. (59 yrs young!!!) :-)  The game play was smooth at first then it started lagging and finally locked up my Kindle fire, after rebooting it's running smoothly again but if it lock up again it's toast. KF takes forever to reboot!!!!! Not worth it.
B00M58FRW6|5|Primus - nuff said.
B007HACDLK|4|entertaining read....just wish there would've been a little more on the tail-end of the story.  Wrapped up a little too neatly and too quickly.  Mitch Rapp continues to be my favorite character, so more is always better.
B008Y212PI|4|Have enjoyed this game. Nice and relaxing - easy to find yourself wasting a lot of time doing it! As other reviewers have said, it's a shame the puzzle pictures don't look much like the object they're supposed to be.
B008602KQI|2|I have read all of the hunger games books,and found a lot of mistakes in this movie. In my opinion, if your gonna make a movie you have to come down to every detail. This also had no impact whatsoever.
B009CCBCU4|5|Incorporating history into her story, Zoe Saadia takes the reader on a journey to days gone by. She writes engaging characters, such as Kuini, one of the main characters, with whom I alternated between joyful moments and times of grief. She makes us care for what may happen to them in the next twist or turn.<br /><br />Born in the Highlands, Kuini models himself after his father, the Warriors’ Leader. He thinks life is simple—just hunting and fighting. With such a perfect outlook, you just know it will all change as you turn the page…<br /><br />Five stars.<br /><br />This book was sent to me gratis for an unbiased review.
B00SPF2HU8|5|I LOVE THIS SONG!
B0000AK7AB|5|I love it !!!
B007SGM084|5|Best book I have EVER read!!! :) Hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as I did...hope that there is more
B00F91RYL8|2|Every cliche, very predictable, and would be laughable if it wasn't trying to be serious. Would have been good maybe 20+ years ago. Save your money.
B0009P5YXO|5|My fiance is a huge Doctor Who fan! He's been talking about making a Doctor Who from David Tennant series costume for Halloween this year, I thought to myself, what better way yo help his costume off then getting a sonic screwdriver to go with it?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Risner
B00992CF6W|5|So much fun but where is 0.1.2.0 update
B00000AFFF|5|My favorite songs on this CD are &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot; and &quot;Toledo&quot;.  I have always loved Burt Bacharach and this CD is no exception.  Elvis Costello interprets the music so well you can visualize  the stories in the songs.  This is a fantastic CD!!
B004EPZ084|5|My favorite comedy of 2011 so far. Great performances from all of the cast especially Charlie Day. I recommend this to any comedy fan!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|No matter what your beliefs are concerning Jesus, this book gives the reader a chance to look at the life of Jesus from an historical viewpoint as opposed to the point of view presented in the bible, giving a much broader idea of how the Christian religion started and grew. The book presents historical data that reflects the broad dynamics of the time, with actual historical accounts written by the eras' historians in their words.  If you are interested in the life of Jesus as just a man who had a great influence on mankind, or as the son of God, who gave the world a blueprint for heaven on earth, you will enjoy the wonderful stories and historical records that are presented here.  I came away with a better understanding of the life and times of Jesus and how his presence has created a world wide religion.
B00001OH7M|3|The first of his \\"rock\\" albums is rather unique in the Bowie canon, featuring, as it does, mainly narrative lyrics accompanied by acoustic instruments.  For anyone who reckons Bowie is all artifice or that he can only write abstract lyrics, listen to this and re-evaluate. <br /> <br />The songs are, on the whole, rather fine.  Apart from the title track, standouts include Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud, Letter to Hermione and Memory Of A Free Festival (although there's a better, electric version doing the rounds).  The rest of the songs are pretty nice too. <br /> <br />It's a gentle introduction to David Bowie and listening to this album, you'd never believe there was a glam rock monster waiting to be spawned.
B00FN811SY|5|THIS JW APP IS GREAT, I CAN GET ALL MY INFO FROM THIS APP. DUE TO PHYSICAL HANDICAPP, I AM ABLE TO TAKE MY TABLET TO THE KINGDOM HALL AND EVERYTHING I NEED IS LOADED ON MY TABLET, THIS ELIMINATE TAKING ALL MY HEAVY BOOKS. ABSOLUTELY GREAT!
B00BR4QNJ0|5|This game has not 1, but 5 hero's u can control. It has hundreds of waves and it has multiplayer, so u can steal other people's stuff. If u have enough time, buy this games. Seriously. I already got to wave 102. Still playing =D
B006AZZPCM|5|Nice
B007K3JCAE|4|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Watson, along with Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and other minor characters from the previous film. Downey and Law have the same fantastic chemistry as before. Though, Downey seems to be acting even more eccentric than ever as he follows the clues and his wild theories on a high speed adventure across Europe. Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza, a gypsy who Downey and Law must team up with along the way. Simza is a mysterious character, though a bit wooden. Jared Harris does an excellent job as the infamous Professor Moriarty. As Holmes' greatest adversary in the original novels, Moriarty is the only person who is on the same intellectual level as Holmes.<br /><br />A Game of Shadows is a strong sequel to Downey's first Sherlock Holmes film. I enjoyed this story a bit more in fact, as there were no elements of the bizarre mysticism of the first. This was another wild ride of humor, drama, mystery, and action-packed adventure.  The mystery and suspense kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. And the many comic relief lines had me laughing out loud. The suspense built to a massive climactic ending that was a bit predictable, yet completely enjoyable all the same. I hope this series continues with the same fine actors and keeps the light-hearted humor paired with intense action and intrigue.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Special Features:<br />o Maximum Movie Mode: Inside the Mind of Sherlock Holmes - Hosted by Robert Downey, Jr.<br />o Focus Points:<br /> - Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: A Perfect Chemistry<br /> - Holmes Without Borders<br /> - Moriarty's Master Plan Unleashed<br /> - Holmesavision on Steroids<br /> - Sherlock Holmes: Under the Gypsy Spell<br /> - Meet Mycroft Holmes<br /> - Guy Ritchie's Well-Oiled Machine<br />o UltraViolet Digital Copy of the film<br /><br />DVD Special Features:<br />o Focus Points:<br /> - Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: A Perfect Chemistry<br /> - Moriarty's Master Plan Unleashed<br /> - Holmesavision on Steroids<br />o UltraViolet Digital Copy of the film<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows(tm)  Movie App Notes:<br />* The Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows(tm)  Movie App enables your iPad 2 or Kindle Fire to control your Blu-ray(tm) movie and expand your movie watching experience.

B00004Z459|5|I don't really remember how many different bands I've tried or how many CD's I've purchased this year from Korn, Bizkit, Staind, Disturbed, and so on, but this is by far the best CD I have purchased this year.<br />I initially purchased the CD for the song CRAWLING but I will say that Papercut and One Step Closer feed your hunger for that &quot;minor key&quot; melodrama and send you home with Chester Bennington's threatening screams.  The group then hits &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; which add great riffs from Mike Shinoda.  These songs invoke some sort of visceral response because the musics grabs you and the lyrics are deep.<br />My favorite song is &quot;In the End&quot; because I like the persistently haunting piano repeating itself in the background and the the message of the song adds to the repetition.  Really listen to this one.<br />If you only buy one CD this year, make it this one.  There are easily 9 songs on this album that you will want to listen to over and over again.<br />RECOMMENDATION - DO NOT MISS!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0076DCT2G|3|The first 40% of the book could have been skipped entirely.  It appeared that the author was simply trying to fill space with irrelevant and often repeated information.  This information was obviously intended to amuse the reader but, to me, only distracted from the story which was excellent once one got to it.  I recommend a very fast read for the first few chapters and then settle in to a very good and different story.
B00DJFIMW6|5|My 5 year old grandson asked me to download the game an loves playing it.  I made him a Minion hat and he wears it while playing the game. He said the game is a challenge to play, remember he is 5.
B0054JZC6E|5|I really think this is a great game because by buying only one game you get way more than you are paying. so I think this is a great game if you dont want to buy a ton of games and use a lot of money.
B00AEFXQ5C|5|great movie
B00F1RR3Y8|5|My 6-year old granddaughter is a &#34;girly-girl&#34; and loves doing her own nail.  This app gives her the opportunity to use her imagination and create beautiful nails!
B00H58VGIA|5|Sue Monk Kidd brings the Grimke sisters to life in this inspired and well researched book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B00004XPPB|4|Slightly depressing at times, but overall a good reenactment. I'm not sure how accurate it is compared to the true events, but I think it portrayed the interactions and emotions as they might be in that situation. Very well done.
B004UJAOLM|5|It's a shame Emily wrote only one book. This was haunting, piercing master piece. It will leaving you uneasy about human nature for a long time.
B000BF0D9M|5|I bought this CD after hearing \\"Mario Takes a Walk\\" on Sirius radio several times. I found this cd which seems to be a compilation of some of his previous CD's. Althought I had never heard of Jesse Cook before purchasing this cd, the musical samples sounded interesting. I have really enjoyed this cd which is a radical change from what I normally listen to in music.
0439023513|5|The only thing that I didn't like about this book was that it ended an incredible series.  The characters that you've learned to love from The Hunger Games through Catching Fire, only make you feel more for them and fall even more in love with them in this book.  This book is incredible, I only wish that it was longer, because when it was over so was this series...  Suzanne Collins, please write more.
B00004BZ0N|5|This is a really good album from the Clash! It would be really hard to describe this but I will try, so it is kind of like a blend of rock, punk, and reggae. Buy this album you won't regret it!
B001VZY4MS|5|Another product from Buffalo Springfield, Neil is an exceptional songwriter and musician. This being his first solo album he has the feel only he can produce, love lost and a broken heart. From &#34;The Loner&#34; dedicated to Stephen Stills to &#34;The last trip to Tulsa&#34; Neil exhibits his ability to not only write, but perform extremely well. By the way Stephen Stills' &#34;The Needle and the Damage Done&#34; was in answer to Neil's &#34;The Loner&#34;.
B007SGLZP8|5|I stayed up all night reading this book - I was soooooo tired the next day, but it was totally worth it!  I work in the legal field, and have for 25 years, and I just love the accuracy of the law, and the roller coaster of emotions . . .terrific book!  I can't wait for the next one!
B004LUHQ1G|5|I really like this album I'm just now checking it out if your a fan of for fighters then this is a must
0609610570|5|Excelent description of what it takes to create an organization that consistently gets things done and done well - a must for implementation of strategy. Can help an individual improve performance, but is really an explaination of how a well run organization should operate; so if you organization does not meet the requirements, you can work to change it or find a better organization (depending on your influence within your organization).  Liked it so much, bought multiple copies to give to coworkers.
B00847KFDS|5|The was the best CD of 2013.  I loved hearing all the old Creedence songs sung by famous groups and country singers with John Fogerty!
B00881PTRC|4|I like this game. Always have liked the hangman games! This is somewhat challenging and easy to navigate. Easy way to pass the time for a quick game here and there.
B00A3NQNUU|1|I just did an update on dragonvale and it's starting me over at level one.  How can in get back to where I was?
B00AB7HESI|5|This is creative. Good job to the creators.
0517189542|5|The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story.  Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war.   Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women.  It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love.  Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste.  The character I related to the most was Jo.  I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked.  I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things.  I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot.  My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone.  Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.  <BR>  I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older...  This is a great book for teaching these things to children.
B00MNYTWMI|1|Takes too long to download.  Froze up before starting.
B00G5G7K7O|3|I'm giving this 3 stars. Movie is great, and I rate it 5. But unlike most people, I will review the Blu-ray and it's use, not a review of the movie. Watching Frozen in theatres was jaw-dropping. Great visuals, even when most of the time, the film was set at night or in dark scenery. The way they were able to do the lighting was probably the best ever done in a cartoon. However, the transfer to Blu-ray takes a serious step back! Not sure if it is the transfer process to Blu-ray, or issues with my PS4. Hopefully someone who has a PS4 can vouch for me and maybe come to a conclusion why the picture is subpar. Maybe I have the PS4 at the wrong settings? Hmm. Anyways, the picture is darker than what the movie was in theatres, and the colors are not vibrant at all!  None of the ice making sequences were vivid, and are very dull. Anyone else have these issues when playing the Blu-ray on the PS4? If the issue can be corrected, then I'll change my rating to 5 stars.
B004J4WKUQ|5|I've had just about enough of these teen post-apocalyptic books but I could not stop reading this one until I was finished. As someone who turned 13 in June of 1980, this book was a total blast from the past. Fantastic premise and I was really able to get into and root for (or against) the characters. I was thoroughly entertained.
B0025KVLTW|5|Well, if you love The Beatles, this is a must have for your collection.  It's so much fun and so silly.  Singing along to these songs just makes you happy.  Even if you aren't a fan of The Beatles, I think it's fun music to have.  I have a copy of this and I bought this particular CD for someone as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  This is music that just never gets old.
B00GIZC1EE|5|Greatness begat greatness.  This is the case with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  This fast paced, dark, and I mean dark, children's film takes Dr. Jones from Far East to Near East in this adventure.  So dark was this film that MPAA created an entirely new movie rating category just to encompass the film.<br /><br />Once again, great scripts, teamed with great acting, directing, editing and music - John Williams was a master of his craft - took hero Indy back to the big (and small) screen in style.
B00EDX76PW|5|great 3D movie, and about a great book.  My grandson loves Percy Jackson's books, I got this mostly for him, but really enjoyed the movie.  This was also a good addition to my 3D collection.
1250030951|5|Bought this book for my 16-year-old daughter.  She loves fan fiction and is a huge fan of Rainbow Rowell.  She finished this book within a week...even attempted to read this during classes!
B0018O4YSQ|4|The bluray directors cut comes with a second disc with a digital copy on it, as is becoming popular with many releases.  The digital copy in this case is a restricted Windows Media Video, which is not Mac compatible, according to the included insert (ironically, the graphic directing you to insert the disc in your computer is a MacBook. go figure).
B00L436E7A|2|I have a Samsung Galaxy Exhibit and most apps I play are in good definition and can have great feedback. Now, although true skate was one of the first skateboard games out there, I don't like the definition on this game, seems as if it were something like 420p. Controls are good, but when it comes to something like flips, the board moves in another direction. One improvement they should fix is either to buy an HD Version or to just increase game quality.
B00ENYCQX8|1|I was looking forward to finally having an Epub program on my Kindle Fire so I could read my Epub files. Unfortunately this program crashed the first time I tried opening it. I had to restart my Kindle just to delete it since it froze it entirely. NOT what I was looking for.
B003ITIQ88|4|This is a touching story of love and loyalty, sentimental
B0064MPXFA|4|Either Julianna Margulies is a pretty good actress, or she is naturally very poker faced.  Pretty good show.
B00KGEQYNW|3|Fun, simple and good for all ages
B00BGIC2J2|2|Despite a great cast, &#34;This Is 40&#34; is not particularly funny and is stocked with unlikeable, egotistical characters. Sure, all adults remain children, but most, we must hope, aren't as selfish and crude as these.
B000R8YC18|5|This my all time favorite Robert Di Nero that he was ever made! I was expecting it to be one of favorite movies of all time! Excellent, excellent movie for the ages of 18 and over!
B005GFPZYK|5|Love it! Awesome read
B00499NHLC|5|It takes time to film these every season, and I appreciate the quality of the directing, the acting, and the special effects.  It's difficult to be patient and wait until January 2014 for Season 3, and anticipation has me watching the calendar.
B00KY7PEAA|2|If anything MZ has gotten even less customer friendly. Said goodbye this week to a fun teammate whose account was hacked and utterly destroyed...MZ has the ability to track many things; sadly this guy probably spent over $40,000 (yes that's possible) and he loved the game. Someone got into his account and destroyed all his buildings plus billions upon billions of troops. The letter he got back was so rude and ugly; MZ blamed the player for sharing his account log in. This player had used a pin but even that was not enough to stop this hacker, who (we hear) has stolen and blackmailed or zeroed players before.  This is the third big player I've personally known who lost a major account to a hacker or who had a hacker blackmail them or destroy their account. When it's working right the social and strategy parts of the game make it really fun but players seem to have to leave their kingdoms and start over to keep it exciting, because the game is so geared to just luring in new players with more affordable deals. Or people just quit. It would be nice if Game of War focused on keeping customers too.
B002MQYOFW|4|This is one of the best books I've read in a while and the movie is good too  I can't wait for catching fire the movie to come  out on Netflix and moking jay to came out In theaters
B0026HUQ9K|5|I had to read this book for college, and I found it insightful. There was a lot of key point that were brought to the forefront on my strengths and how I can utilizes those strengths to my fullest potential.
B0034DGPEU|5|the reality, the facts, so well written, weaved into a wonderful story that speaks of truth and triumph, a great read
B00E8KLWB4|4|So far this has been a good hidden object game.  Will have to see about the energy limitations.  Sometimes they just drag the game down.
B003ZJ70W4|5|Perfect
B00CLD65X0|5|As in the past seasons, the storylines were great and the acting was superb. I can't wait for season 4 to begin.
B0090EHVMC|5|Awesome movie!
B00B2JSRAS|5|It is one thing yo read spiritual books and another to try and figure out how to implement this stuff.  This gives step by step instructions - connecting to God for dummies.  It is wonderful.
B00136JS12|5|Awesome...as it has been for...such a long time.
0380778556|5|I had always heard that &quot;Rebecca&quot; was a wonderful piece of literature and had thought about reading it &quot;someday.&quot;  Then one day I picked it up at the bookstore and fell hopelessly in love.  It was  far beyond my expectations.  Heartwrenchingly beautiful and elegant, I  understand why it is a classic.  Though it starts a bit slow it only gets  better and better until the abrupt ending that makes you gasp!
B00DPM7TIG|1|Elegantly written.
B00N1JQ2UO|2|not real good
B00G5G7K7O|5|Recently It seems like Disney just keeps one-upping itself because Frozen was incredible in every respect. The Story was very good: I won't give any spoilers but I can say I have never seen the like of it and It is special indeed to have two awesome Disney princesses in a single movie. The animation is flawless down to the last detail thank you to a new technique Disney has in creating animated snow. The Characters, oh where do I begin, were outstanding: The voices were perfect and each character had a unique personality which pulled me into the story itself.<br />I could go on but time gets the better of me. Everything was perfect: the Music (especially the incredible Idina Menzel as Elsa), the Plot, Humor, Setting, everything. I found myself walking out of the theater just wanting more. And more. Disney has out done themselves.<br />My only complaint is that it didn't last longer
0553260111|5|Ludlum wrote an exceptional thriller that serves as a page-turner by itself and an addictive drug that can only be satisfied by reading The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Supremacy, the two books that follow. Go ahead and buy all three at once, it will save you the trip to the bookstore when you finish &quot;Identity.&quot;
B00ADIT8U2|5|I don't like HOG and thankfully this is not one of those.  I really enjoyed this game. The only complaint  that I would have is that I wish the game could have been longer.  I hope to see more games like this!
B0033H7VI6|5|Just got my knife today ! I have to tell you that this is one beefy knife it looks like it will last a lifetime ! Out of the box it came Very sharp might need just a little fine tuning. The Sheath is well made I put a large leatherman tool in the front pouch fits great !  Also got a magnesium fire starter and Paracord attached ( going to use it all for my Bugout bag ! Very Happy with purchase !!
B000PKX2KA|2|Did not work properly with my Delorme 2014
B001GCUNYO|4|A good movie.
B00T3DNKIE|3|I was disappointed in the lack of character depth and the lack of connection between then and now.
B00GH2SOM6|2|The most hard to read book I have ever tried to read.
B0052VUNHC|1|The author took out one of the more interesting aspects of the story. I had imagined readers were going to get a rich and fast-paced world-building of underground boxing that would be tied in with a wonderful romance. Definitely not. In the beginning the characters draw you in. Abby is strong-willed and outspoken. Travis is a good-looking bad boy. Two characters with a lot of potential. I wanted it to be great. I did. Unfortunately I found myself beginning to walk backwards, retreating from the characters that I had begun to connect to. Half way through the book the characters' strong feelings for each other quickly turn into an uncomfortable and immature possession. There are no layers or complexities in their relationship. A big focus on sex, sexual attraction, and their anger and violent tendencies and immature reactions lead to steamy lustful sex. Sorry. None of it is the least bit romantic to me.   I agree with the select few who expressed concern that this book was given such rave reviews. In the end I didn't care for the characters or the story. I wish I could say otherwise.
B00019GG1M|5|This Edition comes with a Bonus track of My Imortal in a slightly different edition.  This version of My Imortal starts up much faster and the flow of the notes is already consistant not somewhat skewed like the original.  There are many other mild newances to this version of the track it is definantly good.  I bought the Argentina Version which is the same as this.  It's a wonderful album.  I hear this version of this track may be avaiable on a single as well.  I'll have to see.  Enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|4|I love the game but wish there were more instructions on how to make better moves. I've been on one number and can't seem to get beyond this stage.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love it.
B00P42WROG|4|If you like Stephen King, you won't be disappointed.  I especially like the fact that multiple characters from his books are beginning to be a part of the same story line.  As usual, Mr. King has moments where his writing has such visual clarity it can take your breath away.
B00EHMFC78|4|I just love his writing! Such fun story lines! Keep writing David!<br />Can never get enough of Will Robie! Thank you :)
0515141429|1|I read the first five novels because I wanted to get into this character. I love Mitch Rapp and Scot Harvath, so thinking Jack Reacher would be another I would like didn't seem like a stretch. Story line is too inconsistent. The writing is downright mediocre, at best. The research was non-existent. I can't begin to explain all the problems with Reacher's superhuman skills. He does things not even the best trained snipers in the world can do. He has the instincts of a career detective, which could have been honed in the special investigations unit he belonged to. He is as technically and tactically proficient as the most combat tested career special ops soldier. If he was any one of these things and the writer had done his research, the story would be more compelling and not unreadable.<br /><br />He would be alone as the only person in the world with the level of proficiency and skill sets he possesses. He would not be this disenfranchised drifter without a history. He would be very well known in the military world and very sought after when his military career concluded. He would not be one of these guys who falls between the cracks and no one cares. So the only explanation is he was intentionally a mediocre soldier who sold his country short by hiding his skills.<br /><br />My last criticism is the way people talk in the novels. I don't care where you are from in the US, the incomplete and incoherent phrases are not used by anyone. It makes the reading that much more difficult.<br /><br />I so much wanted to like these books and this character. Maybe his writing and research gets better after the 5th novel, but I just couldn't take it anymore.
B005KJZDXK|5|Great music delivered to my door for a great price. What more can I say? This disc is exactly what I expected it to be and I am pleased with my pruchase.
0321934318|4|This is a excellent book on LR 5.  But you must follow the course pattern to really be successful using just this book.  It does have a good index, and many of the sections need you to go online, or go to youtube.com.  The instructions are very good, and easy to understand.
B004SIIBGU|4|I really love this app. I am on it every day. The only issue I have is the loading time. It can break you in an auction.
B00005JMFQ|1|it was green the whole time!!!<br /><br />Kelly Muir Kelly Muir Kelly Muir Kelly Muir Kelly Muir Kelly Muir Kelly Muir
B00GUJP9PG|1|I was curious and so i downloaded this app. Boring is the first word i would describe this sim as being. I actually would find the sim enjoyable if i could blow stuff up. I mean, who wants to plow fields on a sim? I could mow my lawn and have a better experience. Now, i really didn't expect much, it is a farming sim but the app creators could have spiced it up a bit (or maybe i didn't hang around long enough.)
B008K9SG9K|4|This CD is solid from beginning to end. There were several songs that I had heard of but didn't realize who the artist was.
B000PKX2KA|4|It is a good gps but it seems to be made for older operating systems and you probably have to download updated drivers to get it to work.  It wasn't just plug and play.  It was reading the tiny print to find the company website and start searching for support and downloads and installing drivers before it would work.
B000002UB3|5|Abbey Road is another one to own. This album just really rocks! I like the way they blend in some songs with eachother. This album, if you want to know, totally shows what The Beatles are capable of doing. From &quot;Come Together&quot; to &quot;Her Majesty&quot; this album has nothing but &quot;creative&quot; all over it. A must own for all Beatles and non-Beatles fans!!
B0069G5Z9K|5|This game is so much fun. I think everyone will like this game. I don't regret getting it. The game is awesomly awesome and what makes it even better is that it's free. BUY IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B008QTVNUI|5|Love it but could be just as good without all the sex.
B00000K2SC|5|This is the best movie I have ever seen! The movie is so good words cannot describe it! The story line is the best I've ever seen, the fx are the best, this is the best movie out there. If you can only get one movie, this should be it. I gave this movie five stars because I couldn't anything I didn't like about it. The bottom line is this is the best movie ever made in the history of movies.
B004HW7JMO|1|The video is ok, production values excellent. Still it comes to nothing when the glue that is at the bottom of the package sleeve leaked  onto one edge of disk #1 ruining it. I ended up throwing the set out, since disk #2 is very short and mostly taken up with extras. If you order this title, be sure to remove it asap from its original packaging.
B00L9B7IKE|3|The book was okay.  The pace picked up towards the end and I found myself wanting to spend much more time reading.  But my overall impression was just okay.
B002VECM6S|5|This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Bullock was excellent. If she didn't win some kind of award for this, she should have. Sometimes, these \\"triumph-of-the-human-spirit\\" movies can be sappy and lame but this was great. Of course, the fact that it's a true story just makes it even better.    Highly recommended.
B001L83PLQ|5|Great story teller.  This is the third book I have read by this author.  Would recommended them all.  Fascinating to learn about the culture...and how life can change  from having the the necessities of life to  fighting for enough to eat.  This author has the ability to bring the characters to life..and you want their story not to end.
B0046B3QTG|5|Great for the whole family.  A family movie that the is enjoyable for everyone.  A must see and highly recommended.
B0017SWPXY|5|Loved this book. Well written and a beautiful story for anyone who has ever had a dog in their life or for anyone who needs to to step out of their heads and get a new perspective on life.
B0086700CM|5|This game is fun and simple simple enough to be great. this is a great app. enjoy temple run and play forever
B00003CWRX|4|It really is the perfect combo. Mann, director of thriller-of-the-decade 'Heat', along with giant Pacino and hot property Crowe. Add an excellent  supporting cast (including Plummer), a true story with real drama, and  atmospheric music, and you appear to have the ideal package.<br />Except . . .  except . . . it's too long. And I hate saying that, because I LIKE long  movies, but there's just not enough drive in this to make it to the end  without a push. Mann also seems confused about his lead - Crowe gives a  superlative performance worthy of the camera's eye, yet at the end of the  day it's Pacino who gets the closing shot. Crowe's character is cast aside.  Is this a veiled comment on Pacino's character's attitude towards his  charge?<br />But Mann's accomplishment, in the end, is to create a masterwork  which, as you watch, you forget is a film. All the characters and actors  seem to be real, and you tune in so perfectly to the style and direction  that any other film, watched after 'Insider', seems thin, cartoonish.  Two-dimensional. That is Mann's unique gift, and you're missing out if you  miss it.
B007QJ8VBI|2|Definitely before women's lib

031286504X|5|The story that started it all.  'I Am Legend' is the classic story that inspired countless zombie movies and stories, despite being technically about vampires.  This is not just about monsters,  but human nature, the environment, and our future in an evolving scientific world.  This book also contains several short stories by Matheson that are exceptional.  A must read.
B001NEK2GE|5|I love this product and have owned it for over 2 years now. I use it for every game I play. It makes long gaming sessions easy and comfortable. The back-lighting is great and customizable. It is versatile, easily programmed, and the support-community forums provide answers for even the most obscure questions. Of all the gaming peripherals I have owned, this is my favorite. I use it heavily and it has never malfunctioned. If it ever breaks, I will replace it immediately.      Edit (8/27/2014): A couple of weeks ago, my G13 finally malfunctioned due to the hours and hours of use I subjected it to. I took it as an opportunity to order the Razer Orbweaver for comparison purposes. After 60+ hours of use of the Orbweaver, I concluded that I still prefer the Logitech G13 and ordered a second one. For those of you wondering why I didn't like ther Orbweaver, here is the review I wrote after two months of use:    \\"I have used both the Orbweaver and the Logitech G13 for prolonged gaming sessions (40+ hours logged on each). While the Orbweaver has mechanical buttons (so nice!), the design of the thumb stick renders it imprecise/impossible to use for anything other than camera or movement. The customization options for the ergonomics is nice, but I didn't find that if made much of a difference in my comfort or ease of use. The Razer Synaspe program necessary to program the keys is a pain to use and there is no macro recording on the fly.     Personally, I preferred the functionality and comfort of the Logictech G13 to the Orbweaver. The G13 has more programmable buttons and the thumb stick is more functional for how I use it. The G13 is also significantly cheaper and has a progammable LCD. The Logitech Gaming Software is much easier to use and more flexible in functionality due to being able to directly code using LUA. While the G13 is not mechanical, I have not had any problems gaming with it.    If mechanical keys are a deal-breaker, the Orbweaver will fulfill your requirements, but it is my opinion that the Logitech G13 is the better overall product for the above listed reasons. If only Logitech would release a mechanical G13. . . \\"

1432794426|5|Karen Moriarty has written a compassionate portrayl of Michael Jackson's life & legacy. Her passion and empathy for Micheal is a comfort for the reader, as so many lies have been told about this kind gentle genius. Michael was a wouded soul who only wanted to Heal the World to make it a better place for all of us. Defending a King in its own way is healing for him, and those who have loved and defended him for so long. The truth must be told and Karen Moriarty tells it at last!

B004SVM7BW|2|Repligo is pretty fast, has a usable interface, and feels good to use.  It does really well with formatted text files like ebooks.  However, it does a horrible job with displaying scanned page books like what you'll get from archive.org.  The images are very blocky and pixelated.  Even if the handling of the text-y parts is a 5, this handling of scanned books brings it down to a 2 for usability for me.  ezPDF and Adobe Acrobat Reader are much quicker and display the scanned PDFs with no blockiness at all.  Actually, Adobe (surprisingly) is the best of the 3 for reading scanned books.

B000TEUSJK|4|We saw this movie when it first was broadcast on HBO a long, long, long time ago ... had to watch it twice to make sure what we were seeing was actually what we were seeing. Then had to watch it a third time to make sure.<br />This is NOT a movie for children to watch! Even if \\"Caligula\\" was called \\"Little Boots\\" in ancient Rome, THIS IS NOT A film for the kiddies. Actually, I'm not sure my Grandmother is old enough to watch this! But I am ...<br />Malcolm McDowell portrays Caligula as a lot of history implies - sadistic, degenerate and totally amoral. Reminds me a bit of his role in Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", but not quite as unnerving.<br />Obviously, we cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the content, but it is an interesting film.<br />If you have the chance, watch it for yourself. You'll agree.

B00000JPH5|4|This movie takes you by the hand and leads you out of the world of reality and into the Goblin King's dark and devious world where anything can and does happen. Mystical characters, twists at every turn and a path fraught with magical trickery and some danger. The Labyrinth is a magical mystery tour that can be enjoyed by old and young alike.
B0081336FO|5|Sherlock series two is absolute fun, both for fans of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories and those who have yet to read Dr. Watson's narratives. The BBC's updated version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales keeps the viewer on his or her toes with witty dialogue, plenty of nods to the original stories, and stunning cinematography. The main characters are mesmerizing to watch, no matter how many times you return to Baker Street.

B00000JHAU|5|Belle and Sebastian belong to that rare group of Pop bands who can write AND play well.... without coming off like pretencious wonky PhDs in the process.<br />Almost all of the tracks here display musicianship that deftly layers melody over counter-melody, counter-melody over poly- rhythmic what the... But none of that matters a bit, because every word you hear comes from the heart, not from an existentialist textbook.<br />B & S write aching vignettes too full of ... and vinager to be mistaken for cloying or sentimental fluff, and they carry some very substantial weight. It's not just youthful anger laced in disappointment. These are real people... from the frustrated closet case in \\"Seeing Other People\\", the stymied military man in \\"Me and The Major\\", to the willfully wistful title heorine of \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses.\\"<br />And if the title track reminds you more than a little of Simon and Garfunkel's lighter side circa 1965, it's no accident. Like that other seminal Folk/Pop duo, B & S's strongest asset is their ability to present the truth in a light far more beautiful than it ever deserves.

B007B6VOG0|5|I got this album after hearing 'Some Nights' and 'We are Young' on the radio. With two great songs, what was there to lose?<br /><br />For my tastes (alternative / pop), Some Nights and We Are Young are the two best tracks. The 'Some Nights (Intro)' opener is a close second place, evoking of all things Queen, circa [[ASIN:B004ZJFH5K A Night At The Opera (Deluxe Version)]].<br /><br />The lead singer Nate Ruess has a distinctive voice and great range. Don't let the mention of auto-tuning in other reviews turn you off. Though there are a couple examples mixed in for effect, his vocals are outstanding and in tune on their own, and make up the vast majority of the singing on the album.<br /><br />The rest of the album is a mix of good and very good songs. Carry On and One Foot both stand out. I've been listening to parts of the album a couple times a day, and probably the whole album every couple days for a few weeks now. I'm still nowhere near sick of it.<br /><br />Great music, and I'm looking forward to checking out their other albums. Five stars!

B000JMKTLO|5|Another great story by Gillian Flynn. The twists and turns keep you turning the pages. Ready to read her next book.
044022425X|3|Okay, I will say, as has been said so many times, the original Outlander book was fantastic!!  It was exciting, and fun, and original, and funny, and intelligent.  It was a time travel (set in 1946 and 1773) adventure filled with intrigue; at it's center the soul-mate romance of James Fraser and Claire Randall.  I couldn't put it down.<br />The second book: Dragonfly in Amber was also wonderful.  Introducing Claire and Jamie's child as an adult back in 1969, and Claire telling her the tale of how she and Jamie tried to protect his people and stop the Scottish battle of Culloden.  And how, in the end, Jamie forced Claire to return to her time because they could not stop the deadly battle.  It was near as good as the first with all the fiery, intelligent dialogue and intense plot twists.<br />The third: Voyager.  Claire chooses to go back in time when she finds out Jamie didn't die at Culloden, but it's been 20 years.  They are different people, but they find they still love each other immensely, and can't be apart.  Again, almost as good as 1 and 2, but maybe a little less fun, a little more....unrealistic, perhaps.  Still somewhat fun, and hopeful at the end.<br />The fourth book: Drums of Autumn.......hmmm.......I agree with many reviews that this story lacked sufficient editing.  There were way too many times when the author went on and on and on about inconsequential stuff, like the surrounding woods (she did that a lot).  I realize a certain amount of description is necessary to put the reader in the moment, but it got tedious and a bit boring.  I did not mind, as some, that Jamie and Claire were trying to settle in the colonies.  Jamie even said, that he is 45 years old and should own a home and some land.  I agreed.  I was wondering when DG was going to relieve Claire and Jamie of their nomadic, penniless lifestyle; getting a bit too old for sleeping on the ground in the wilderness in the winter, I would think.  Also, Claire is a few years older than Jamie, and though money doesn't matter to her, a 48 year old woman wouldn't want to sleep outdoors perpetually.<br /><br />Their daughter Brianna and her boyfriend Roger are introduced more fully as they travel back in time to warn her parents of some great matter.  But neither character is flesh and bone, like Jamie and Claire, and some other recurring characters.  They are one dimensional and awkward, especially Roger.  Brianna was okay, a bit inmature, but.....just two dimensional.  And there are things that happened that were obvious plot movers, and not great ones.<br />AND last, but not least, the way Claire and her story were written bothered me; even in the third book.  We never hear enough of what she went through without Jamie.  It's all just superficial surfacey stuff.  Whereas Jamie's life, the 20 years without Claire, is rich and written almost ad nauseum.  Jamie had said he didn't think he wanted to know about her life with Frank, but that he was wrong, and Claire said, we'll talk later, but they never really do.  And while his past his sad and difficult and violent, and constantly being thrown in her face.  Claire's is BORING.  Yet when you hear certain snippets you realize it wasn't.  She's a woman surgeon for Pete's sake, in the 1950-60\\"s.  When she does tell a tale she sugar coats it so Jamie doesn't get upset.  Like when they spoke about how Frank treated her, and she NEVER mentions his many, many girlfriends and how that isolated her, and how that made her feel.  Well, if she did, I missed it.  And did Claire have an affair ever??  One couldn't blame her.<br /><br />Sometimes, honestly, DG writes so cryptically I have to read the dialogue over a few times, and even then I'm not sure I got the gist of it.  That gets worse as the books go on.  Even in the books when Jamie learns one tiny tidbit of her past he is floored that she was lonely or sad; letting us know Claire has never discussed these things with him.  That annoys me because I feel as if it's a 1950's, old fashioned wife thing to do, and Claire is more than that.  She wouldn't nurture Jamie's sensibilities so much.  And when the old Native American lady tells Claire this looooong story of a stranger that Claire is sure is another time traveler, we never hear of Jamie's reaction to this.  Isn't this an interesting piece of news or is time travel so common to the 18th century Highlander that he's yawning through the telling of such stories?  Hmmph!<br /><br />So, I don't know....this installment was a little incongruous, and with a few characters not so well fleshed out.  I liked parts of this installment, but I didn't love it.950's, old fashioned wife thing to do, and Claire is more than that.  She wouldn't nurture Jamie's sensibilities so much.

B00B1E6FF8|5|This isn't an easy movie to watch.  It's based on firsthand accounts of what it took to get Bin Laden. While I know that there is always some degree of dramatic license taken with true stories, my guess is that they toned down what all goes on to avoid being any more difficult to watch.  The assorted articles on various websites say that this is fairly accurate.  I'm not sure that makes it better or worse.  I understand why the men and women who are in the intelligence community have to do the things they do- and I don't have to like them.  I know I couldn't do that job- and I respect that they can.  And I still don't like it.  But the movie is fast paced for roughly 2.5 hours, and as I've seen it again and again, I've picked up on more and more detail.  I can't imagine spending over a decade focused on one man, and what it must have been like after that was done.  I also hope she's safe somewhere.

B000AL730O|5|Forty years ago this month, the Beatles released Paul McCartney's melancholic, autumnal \\"Yesterday\\" as a single in the United States.  Between the June '65 Yesterday/I've Just Seen a Face/I'm Down recordings through the March '67 She's Leaving Home sessions, Paul was at his musical peak, expanding the musical palette of popular music and focusing on the images he wanted to convey in his lyrics. <br /> <br />This brings us to Paul's newest release - \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.\\"  Having listened to it in its entirety this evening at home, I can say that this album, taken as a thematic and unified whole, rivals Revolver and Pet Sounds and George's All Things Must pass, and may narrowly stand above Sgt. Pepper/The White Album/Abbey Road/Band on the Run/Imagine/Ringo.  <br /> <br />I know this statement is bound to cause controversy.  Let me explain.  First, with this album, McCartney has had his first real partner who could veto/censor/modify his ideas since John L. and (early) George M. four decades ago.  Second, this album is both introspective/autobiographical and universal at the same time.  In many ways, \\"Chaos\\" is the mature, adult response to \\"Pet Sounds\\" whereas \\"Pepper\\" took on \\"Pet Sounds\\" musically all those years ago. <br /> <br />In terms of tone and timbre, this album closely resembles the acoustic/piano textures of the quieter tracks on the White Album, McCartney, and Ram.  The prinicpal difference, which makes this music MATTER, is the four decades of life experiences Paul has had since those halcyion and bygone days.  If in the White Album, the Beatles were in the autumn of there musical career together,\\"Chaos\\" finds Paul in the autumn of his life - the shadows starting to lengthen, mortality facing him squarely in the eye, the ghosts of friends and lovers now long gone haunting this man.  By any standard, this album is more than mere pop music, it qualifies as musical and compositional expression of the highest order.  After all, McCartney's recording career now spans an awe-inspiring FORTY-SEVEN YEARS (dating from the 1958 McCartney/Harrison recording \\"In Spite of All the Danger.\\"  Listen carefully to the music and the lyrics - you can hear, in the shadows, the bittersweet and now long lost harmonies of John, George, and Linda in this beautifully haunting music.   <br /> <br />Just like \\"A Day in the Life,\\" Paul here confronts the sadness and difficulties of real life and still believes, as we should all believe, in love and hope.  Not a bad message for a world grown weary by war and natural disasters this September, 2005.

B002KDUDG6|2|On the heels of Streisand's new release, I was like \\"Oooooo Buble is out with a new album!\\" I must say, I've listened to this album quite a few times I still don't get it. The opening number as BOLD as it is sounds like it would work beautifully for the vocals of Dame Shirley Bassey, but I don't understand WHY it was made all big and bold for Michael's take on it. As the closing number, 'Stardust' gets a very crowded sounding treatment with Naturally 7. Buble has an amazing voice. If Stardust had to be done a capella, perhaps there could have been vocal overdubs? The list of songs performed are a great idea, the treatments however are not that interesting.<br /><br />Call Me Irresponsible was a fantastic album, this new one just didn't grab me like the previous album did.

0393035158|4|Harris says things that aren't new, and should be obvious, if only irrational religious thought wasn't given a free pass by far too many people in society. Harris fires the bulk of his ammunition at Islam, and that's fair; it is radical Islam, after all, far more than any other organized faith today, that presents a real threat to freedom around the world. If that strikes some as bigoted and prejudicial, ask yourself the last time you saw radical Christians, Jews, Hindus etc. beating, burning and killing over cartoons. It's almost as if Harris' book foresaw such savage silliness erupting in the Middle East. His chapter detailing just how many times the Qu'ran implores the faithful to kill the \\"infidel\\" should be an eye opener for anyone who reads it. <br /> <br />But Harris certainly offers up real criticism of the other major world religion's as well. He's dead on in stating that it's secular forces from the Enlightenment and after that has brought about much of the decency, fairness, equality, and freedom that does exist in the world today. And he points out that the seeds of a more savage Christianity are still present everywhere in the world today. When you have a sitting member of the Supreme Court derisively dismissing those that \\"value life\\" more than the true believers in eternal life after death, it should worry you how this contagion of thought might effect the behavior of otherwise intelligent people. Think of members of any faith or denomination that truly and sincerely believes that anyone who doesn't follow their way not only will be tortured for all eternity, but deserves it, and then consider what's been going on in secret prisons around the world, and how our President frequently expresses his fundamentalist beliefs, and make the connection for yourself. <br /> <br />Harris weakens his case a bit by delving into his own brands of mysticism. Most of it is harmless, and I would agree that there is much wisdom in Eastern philosophy, but there's much wisdom in Western philosophy also. Harris' cheerleading routine for Asian mysticism rings a bit false considering the tone of the rest of the book.

B00001U0DP|5|This film is so engaging and sweet in the midst of the horrors of the times and setting.  So uplifting and beautifully done. It is not an easy film to watch at times, but worth every second ultimately. The overwhelming love and dedication and character of this man will make you cry, but also laugh.  Not hopeless or maudlin, but ever full of dignity, heart, spirit and tenacity.  I love this movie, and every time I see it, it gives me hope and lifts my heart and soul that such people exist.
B0007MWZEK|5|I had the original red model for a few yrs & decided to order the newer model directly from company.  BIG MISTAKE! After waiting over 2 wks & not receiving I called to learn it was on back order w/no idea when it would be avail.  I was supposed to get 2 for about $74. (The \\"buy one get one free, just pay additional s/h,\\" ad.) I cancelled the order, went to my wonderful Amazon & ordered the new one for a total of $22 w/shipping!  So I could have had the 2 for $44 vs the $74 from the company.  And I had it w/in a few days.  Ok, so the new gray model is basically the same thing & good news is older red battery works in the new grey model.  It does seems to pick up better on difficult surfaces, (indoor/outdoor ribbed mat), but basically the same thing which is a good thing.  It weighs nothing, swivels everywhere, anywhere you want, (this model does not fold in the middle like the red older one), but other than that, the same. I personally love this since it's so easy, great for kitchen & bath floors, & a good quickie on carpeting.  I live alone so not a lot of traffic but I would not be w/out this handy item!  It just does a great job for cheap money & doesn't weigh anything to speak of.  Easy to put together & if you have the older model, the battery will work in the newer model. But BUY it from Amazon!!!
B00C7KYXHW|4|If you're intrigued by serial killers or find yourself wondering how heinous crimes are committed, you will like this show.  The murders are gruesome and the imagery is haunting.  Like a 10-car pile up you can't look away and you will find yourself fascinated by the psychological insight into the minds of the killers.  Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter are excellently portrayed by Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen respectively, and as always Laurence Fishburne brings a formidable presence.  Each killer they hunt is unique and breed their own brand of terror.  There are also some fascinating elements of culture in the form of history, music, science and cuisine. All around a well-produced, entertaining show, especially for network television.
B00ADS98FC|3|We bought Pitch Perfect because my family loved the show The Sing Off. My 9 year old enjoyed it the most. She has watched it at least half a dozen times. It was juvenial for its PG-13 rating which is why I gave it 3 stars. I would recommend it to others because it is a fun movie.
B00H71PHS0|5|Best purchase ever. Best show ever.
B00005JKT8|3|We loved the movie, my husband and I, but were a little disappointed in Meg.  Hugh Jackman carried the movie great, he was charming, handsome and fit the part. But Meg Ryan is looking a bit worn for the part, perhaps due to her recent breakup, but her lips appeared swollen like she'd had some collegen that didn't take well, and her hair was awful.  Despite that, I plan on seeing it again and will certainly buy it when it comes out on DVD!

B000002J1I|3|It comes as a surprise to me that despite this album's reputation, I've listened to this one more than I ever listened to 1977's 'Going For The One'.<br />It's not that Tormato is an infinitely better album or more accessible than Going For The One. I find that Tormato has songs I really like, songs I desperately try to like, and songs that just leave me baffled as to the direction some were going.<br />SONGS I REALLY LIKE:<br />Release,Release to me is a precursor to DRAMA (1980). I hear in this track the direction Howe/Squire/White wanted to go with YES for the 80's. It has been said that the head of Atlantic heard this song from the demos, and thought that if every song followed suit, a great YES album for the new decade approaching was on its way. Unfortunately, Tormato is not Release, Release. You can definitely hear throughout the album that there are two different directions being pursued, one by Howe/Squire/White and one by Anderson/Wakeman. That they united at all is the mystery.<br />'On The Silent Wings of Freedom' is the other song I really enjoy, strong emphasis both on rhythm and unity in the Howe/Squire/White trio. I hear Drama being born on this album, and some of the members realising that the 80's were coming, and others resisting change and forcing a direction that seems has left many fans high and dry in dissatisfaction or puzzlement as to why???<br />'Onward' rests outside these two songs as my other favourite. The reviewer who has stated it may be better suited for Squire's solo album, I have to agree. It does more suit 'Fish Out of Water' than on here, but its still a beautiful song nevertheless, and one of the best things Squire has written, ever.<br />SONGS I DESPERATELY TRY TO LIKE:<br />Future Times/Rejoice , Don't Kill The Whale, and Madrigal. Each song has its strong points, but its on these songs I hear that struggle between two different factions (Howe/Squire/White vs. Anderson/Wakeman) most clearly, and where definitely someone's trying to win. They all have their moments, and though Madrigal is mainly Anderson/Wakeman, it seems a continuation of 'Turn of the Century' from Going For The One, a direction Anderson & Wakeman were definitely heading. After YES were 'classical' in a Beethoven/Stravinsky/Mozart way, it seems natural to explore Baroque music in the YES context, but I think it was too late in YES's career to go Baroque. Back in the Fragile days would have been better suited. The problem is, Anderson & Wakeman were of like mind, but 4 years too late. With Wakeman's departure in 1973, Anderson & Wakeman were as far apart as can be. 4 years later they agreed on the direction, but continuing a course started in 1973 by 1977/1978 seems better suited for a solo project and not in a group situation.<br />SONGS THAT JUST LEAVE ME BAFFLED:<br />Though I think the message of 'Circus of Heaven' I appreciate, that despite all of these wonderful creations mankind produces, the most beautiful seem to be those nature provides (if thats the message at all!!!!) this song seems all wrong for Yes to be doing. I like the fact that a slight reggae feel is incorporated into Yes music, but in 1978 EVERYONE discovered reggae! Well, except for Marley, Tosh, Cliff and all the originators of the genre. 'Arriving U.F.O.' suffers the same fate unfortunately.<br />I have no clue what Anderson & Wakeman wanted Yes to be at this point. It started on Going For The One, and ended disastrously on Tormato. Whether Baroque, or Reggae, or New Wave, whatever they saw, it was in no way prepared for the 80's, and had Howe, Squire & White allowed Anderson & Wakeman to pursue this direction unchallenged, you'd just be hearing about a YES Reunion tour being put together. Yes would have been finished in 1978 or a year later. Whenever I hear the Anderson/Wakeman/Howe/Squire/White grouping ,I always hear a tug and pull going on in the direction of the music. Someone always steps back, someone always stands upfront, its never in themiddle or compromise never pursued. I think every album these 5 people worked on suffers in a way because of it. You also notice that the 4 major works they co-operated on (Tales From Topographic Oceans / Going For The One / Tormato / and 'Keystudio') seem to be the albums that cause the greatest disagreement between Yes members AND Yes fans. It has to tell you that something's not quite right with this 5 man line-up.<br />Buy Tormato for the 3 great songs on here, or the 2 really disliked ones. Its up to you of course. But know that Yes have done far far better than this, and usually one or two of the members that produced this album AREN'T involved.dle or compromise never pursued.

B00NAKWUGY|5|Like other users I thought My vinyl arrived defective and had skipping issues all over the first track and has numerous skips throughout the album. When I read their reviews, I instantly thought that I too had a defective record and was quick to write a review on the defect. I thought I had a defective album and was really bummed. I have a mid-1970s record player and listen to older records (with the exception of this one) and have never had a problem with skipping before. Then I did some reading and found that new albums are slightly different than my vintage albums. The skipping in my case was not a defective album, but user error. I was able to adjust the pressure on my needle for my record player (adjusted to be lighter on the record, the heavier weight was causing the skips) and just like that, my album was no longer skipping! I hope this helps other customers, because I suspect that all other users who also had skipping issues could remedy them by adjusting their record player as I had done. Sometimes, we just have to accept that there is a degree with user error.
B004SDSSFY|4|you need to download the App first, then the key. there are different ones depending on which App store you buy from. Amazon tells me it is different than Googles version.

B000ZLFALI|1|I believe that there are two kinds of people who will like this movie: teenagers who are desperate to find some kind of meaningful rebellion in their own lives (and earn themselves a tragic love story in the process), and people who thrive on pretension like plants thrive on sunlight.  In fact, I am convinced it was a team of these types of people who made this horrible movie in the first place.    The story centers on Jude and Lucy, who, at the beginning of the movie, are both saying goodbyes to that special someone in their lives: Jude, to his girlfriend, as he is going to America; Lucy, to her boyfriend who is shipping off to Vietnam.  Jude tells his girlfriend that he will \\"alway be true\\" (SLEDGEHAMMER OF FORESHADOWING), as Lucy's boyfriend assures her he will return from the war unscathed (ICE PICK OF FORESHADOWING APPLIED DIRECTLY TO THE CRANIUM WITH MAXIMUM FORCE).    Jude comes to America in search of his biological father, who is a custodian at Princeton.  Once Jude finds his father, there's a heartwarming reunion, right?  Nope, his father serves as the excuse for Jude to meet Max, a soon-to-be college drop-out and Lucy's brother.    Of course Lucy and Jude meet and fall in love while interacting with various characters who flit in and out of the story for seemingly no reason except to inspire Beatles puns (Oh, look, there's Prudence the lesbian who \\"came in through the bathroom window!\\", and the \\"Sexy\\" singer, Sadie!) or to tie in events that otherwise would not directly affect the characters already represented (Jojo, the black guitarist, becomes important only when the screenwriters want to shoehorn \\"black\\" events into the script, like the Detroit riots and the death of Dr. Martin Luther King).    There is very little plot.  Events are barely strung together (\\"Dear Prudence\\" sung as a plaintive ode to the forlorn character of the same name, a psychedelic road trip that ends at a Terry Gilliam-esque circus for no apparent reason, a bar room concert that is possibly the least frenetic and seizure inducing bit of the whole film), before Max is shipped off to Vietnam and Lucy, fearing he will meet the same fate as her brother, becomes radically political while Jude immerses himself in his art.  They grow apart, but the viewer finds it difficult to really care, as the only indication given that they are in any sort of relationship is the fact that they gaze soulfully at each other and float nearly nude in a watery blue void.      Of course it all ends Happily Ever After (tm).  Or not.  The viewer doesn't know, as the film closes with Lucy standing on an adjacent rooftop, again gazing soulfully toward Jude.  Her pout is indiscernible, but the music crescendos to let the audience know that they have just experienced some deep universal truth.  The rest of characters' stories are left unresolved as well, unless the viewer wishes to take the time to create their endings for them.    That's one of the main problems with the movie.  It assumes that you will make the connections of the plot yourself.  One moment, Prudence is locked in the closet.  The next, the characters are bumping into her by surprise at the psychedelic circus, where she has seemingly been working for a while.  Jude believes something tragic has happened to Lucy, but he seeks her out without the viewers being shown how his misconception has been cleared up in the first place.  The film is content to careen on from concept to concept without the messy legwork of logistics and plot development.    The biggest crime perpetrated by this film and its makers is the outright abuse of the Beatles catalog.  Fans of the Beatles music (that is to say, fans who did not come into familiarity with the material through this movie alone) know that each song has a context in the vast Beatles mythology, a context which the filmmakers merrily toss aside in favor of bending the pieces to fit their trite version of a love story.  In the worst of cases, lyrics are interpreted literally, making them absurd (underwear clad soldiers march across a miniature Vietnam carrying the Statue of Liberty on their backs while grunting \\"She's So Heavy\\").  Other songs, such as \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" are used to illustrate events that have no correlation to their meaning.    I would like to say that the cast does what they can with the shoddy material they were given to act, but that would be a lie.  They do what they can with the mediocre talent they were given.  Evan Rachel Wood spends much of the movie gazing deeply at things with a pained expression.    Jim Sturgess veers between incorrigible school boy and wounded puppy.  Joe Anderson manages to inject some depth into Max, but he's mostly upstaged by the absolutely asinine dance sequences he's surrounded by in the recruitment office and VA hospital.  Dana Fuchs rasps and vamps her way through the movie as if she's auditioning for a Janis Joplin bio-pic.     It boggles my mind that anyone could give this atrocious film a positive review of any kind.  When I left the theatre, I demanded my money back.  Then I was reminded it was a free screening and, as I could not get the moments of my life back that I lost while watching \\"Across The Universe\\", I feel I deserve to have my memory erased as a fair trade.    \\"Across The Universe\\" is the perfect movie for anyone who felt that \\"Forrest Gump\\" was too in-depth and realistic in its portrayal of the events of the sixties.  Anyone with an appreciation of acting, character and plot development and respect to historical events will just be disappointed.

B006YTTVHO|5|I have know idea what inspired me to choose this read but I'm glad I did. It was a quick read. It did remind me of what I knew and refreshed my thought process.
B0006SSOHC|2|I decided, after watching \\"SAW 3\\" this weekend, to give this movie another look-see, to re-evaluate and check if my original thoughts had changed over the past three years. Nope.<br /><br />\\"Saw\\" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like \\"Se7en\\" and \\"The Cube,\\" where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But \\"Saw\\" completely lacks \\"The Cube's\\" fascist police state backdrop or \\"Se7en's\\" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.<br /><br />When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry. Blood appears on victim's clothing and disappears. And in one of the most hysterically ridiculous gaffs in modern movies, a truck involved in the chase scene changes MODELS by the end of the chase!<br /><br />OK so I sat through the whole thing two times. But the movie's concept is relatively slick - enough to lure in scared patrons to two sequels and make Tobin Bell's Jigsaw one of the better movie villains in recent horror genres. (Incidentally, I feel \\"Saw 2\\" to be the best of the three films, and \\"Saw 3\\" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.) But if you take your horror/suspense movies seriously, you'll understand just how \\"Scary Movie 4\\" made hash out of \\"Saw\\" with barely an effort.4\\" made hash out of \\"Saw\\" with barely an effort.
B000002U9Y|5|Nobody believed they could do it--not even their original management, who abandoned them in favor of Syd Barrett, who now found it impossible to function within the band due to problems that included drugs.  \\"Jugband Blues\\" definitely captures the state he was in, as well as (I think) awareness of his being phased out.  Although I personally don't like this song, it certainly sets the stage for the rest of the album, which aside from one amazing and unique feature, forecasts Pink Floyd's later directions with great accuracy.<br />I feel that Pink Floyd's survival after this blow is owed not to one person, but TWO, who could hardly be more opposite: Richard Wright and Roger Waters.  One might even (if you allow me a bit of poetic license with my usage of the terms) call them \\"yin\\" and \\"yang\\" respectively.  With new guitarist David Gilmour still trying to find his place in the band, having not yet developed an independent style, quiet-natured Richard Wright brought his already-established Eastern-tinged and innovative musical talents to the table.  Even Roger Waters' \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" owes a heavy debt to his keyboarding.  Mr. Wright also makes extensive songwriting contributions, including the gorgeous, haunting \\"Remember a Day\\" and the relaxing (NOT boring, thank you very much!) \\"See-Saw\\", both of which he wrote on his own.  Also remarkable is his vocal contribution.  The remaining half of the excellent Barrett-Wright vocal duo very nearly made his soft, melodic, and unique voice THE voice of Pink Floyd here.  In fact, to my ear, he made it onto *every* track except \\"Jugband Blues\\", although the title track is arguable (duet, Mr. Gilmour, or Mr. Wright?) and \\"Set the Controls\\" is hard to tell.  All I can say on the latter is, compare the faint \\"aaaahh\\" bit to the same place on Live at Pompeii where Mr. Gilmour is clearly doing it, or Ummagumma Live, where Mr. Waters does it, to the \\"aaaahh\\" at the beginning of \\"Far from the Harbour Wall\\" onRick Wright's Broken China, and tell me which the studio version sounds more like.<br />Pink Floyd's \\"yang\\" force, the outspoken Roger Waters, brought his lyrical skills to the table with lyrics to \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (shades of The Wall?), \\"Set the Controls\\" (\\"Will he remember the lesson of giving?\\"), and I think also \\"Let There Be More Light\\".  However, Mr. Waters seems, oddly enough, the more tentative of the opposite RW's on this album, perhaps because he was still working on finding his voice.  On ASoS he relies heavily on outside influences such as Syd Barrett and Chinese poetry.  That said, however, his is a worthy contribution.  <br />Nick Mason fans get a rare chance to hear him in full Eastern-psychedelic glory in the studio setting, most notably on \\"Set the Controls\\" and the apparent forerunner of Echoes (far more so than \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"), \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\".  Lyrically, all three writers are turning away from the Piper-era whimsy towards nostalgia(in Mr. Wright's case) and madness (in Mr. Waters and Mr. Barrett's cases), although some of the psychedelic, free-form style remains.<br />Those of you who have not heard Piper or Relics may be shocked to hear the severe recording-equipment limitations the Floyd suffered from in their early days--this is down to their label, in my opinion, which underfunded them.  This, along with my dislike of \\"Jugband Blues\\" are why I dock the rating of this album half a star.  But as both are due to difficult, uncontrollable circumstances, and the band DOES come through them well, I give them the full 5 stars rather than rounding down.  Overall, this album is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan's collection.  It was truly a unique moment in their history--never again would yin and yang experience such synergy with *both* virtually in \\"command\\".

0321127420|5|If you've read Refactoring or UML Distilled, or Planning XP, you won't be disappointed with this Fowler book.  He's the clearest writer and thinker in the Agile/XP/Patterns group of authors.<br />The book is particularly strong in describing how to map between a persistent relational database and an in-memory object representation of business logic.  Fowler distills the various approaches to their essence, clearly presents the tradeoffs and defines an intuitive vocabulary to make it easier for development teams to discuss how the patterns apply to their unique application.<br />Highly recommended.
1250004349|1|I was really interested in this book, because it involved WWII and the Jews of France.  The subject is something that I think people have not addressed properly and in some ways, it has been swept under the carpet.  My expectations were high.  Unfortunately, the author is not very good.  The characters were contrived and unbelievable.  The writing was simply amateur.  It reminded me of a Lifetime made-for-tv movie.  I wish a decent author had written on this subject.  Too bad!
B0082RHRHC|5|My favorite book of all time! It is written so beautifully. Also, to think of how bold the author was writing as freely as she did for the time.

B00BPDR3F6|4|If I had the ability to, I would average out my rating of this novel to 3.5 stars.<br /><br />The overall complexity of the storyline, detailed descriptions regarding botany and the method in which the tale was interwoven together at the end, all deserve 5 stars. However, towards the middle of the book, strange occurrences involving a new central character to the story, including some of the uncharacteristic decisions made by the female protagonist, all were a little off-putting to me. I found myself wishing this aspect of a very long 500+ page novel could be revised, while maintaining the integrity of the beginning and end of the novel.

B007H9B8FS|5|Enjoying the album for almost a week. Have listened to it non-stop and still a lot of fun. The album stands out as a fine example of a mix of electronica, rock and pop.  Reminds me so much of the 90ies and other awesome Garbage creations of that era. There are very few bands that make this kind of music. If it's your thing, go ahead and get it. The whole album is worth buying; I wouldn't split the songs.
B00GH75V1S|3|I didn't realize the reviews for this movie were bad until I was trying to watch it online-player kept messing up.  This movie is ok, nothing to write home about.
B00000JZC4|1|Where the first Filter album straddled genres and created music with feeling, this is regurgitated hard rock dreck nearly indistinguishable between songs. The first album was alternative crossed with a metal and industrial band, and more than style, had substance in its songs, but this album is pure vomit. Avoid. If you liked &quot;Short Bus&quot; try Godflesh &quot;Selfless.&quot;

B000002U82|5|Let's not beat around the bush!  This album is on the top of many lists.  The equation basically is, if A is you like Rock'N'Roll and B is you like to space out from time to time then the result is C you probably already own Dark Side of The Moon.  People who really dig music know which albums are good from the first to last song....Pearl Jams TEN, Led Zeppelin IV, AND most definitely Pink Floyds' Dark Side of the Moon are albums which you rarely jump to the next track on.  In fact, Dark Side is so good, the CD should have an encryption that disables the jump forward button.  5 out of 5 if you ROCK, 3 out of 5 if you RAP, and 0 out of 5 if your other 9 discs are Britney albums.

B000068TPN|5|I love war movies, It has action and is intense but I also like it because it shows the womans side and how effects her and how they stay strong in times of war. Mel Gibson is the perfect actor for this movie. I like how it shows that he is a father to his childern and his men. So all in all I loved this movie and recomend it to anyone who loves war films. I also recomend black hawk down.

B0000UJL96|5|\\"Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country\\" is my favorite ST film.  Although I've only recently started watching the original series on G4 and TV Land, I've always had more of an attachment to the original crew than any of the others.  Since watching the old series, I've grown to love the original crew even more.  In \\"The Undiscovered Country,\\" our heroes find themselves on the edge of a brand new world in which the Klingons actually want (or for protection's sake, need) peace.  Naturally, Captain Kirk wants nothing to do with the Klingons on this matter.  However, Spock has \\"volunteered\\" the Enterprise to be the escort for the Klingon party to the new peace talks.  Things go wrong when the Chancellor Gorkon, the primary Klingon representative, is murdered on his own ship and it was seemingly done at the hand of the Enterprise.  What follows is a Klingon trial for Kirk and Bones, imprisonment on a Klingon penal mine planet, and Spock and the rest of the gang trying to uncover what's really going on.  It's a wonderful space mystery that I enjoy every time I see it.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it's a nice edition to anyone's collection.  It's full of nice documentaries ranging from a tribute to DeForest Kelley to a neat little segment known as \\"Penny's Toybox\\" in which we get to take a look at some of the props used in the film.  It was refreshing to see that not one of these documentaries (over three hours worth) included the typical self-serving bits as many DVDs include.  Ironically, this particular film could actually get away with documentaries where the crew pats themselves on the back, because this is one of the best \\"Trek\\" flicks ever.<br /><br />A wonderful send off to a wonderful space opera.  Highly recommended.
B0079XPUOW|5|If you are any kind of fan of Star Trek, in any of its iterations, you have to read this book.<br />We all know that in Star Trek, if you are assigned to an Away Team, and you happen to be wearing a Red Uniform Tunic, your chances of survivg said Away Team are slim at best.<br />This story exploits that, and does it with humor.<br />It's sort of a novel of Meta - Science Fiction, and done quite well.
B00D41H2PS|3|When I added the 5th symbol to the shield, I couldn't get them to slide.  Reset, played again, same thing.  I un/re-installed and it played just fine all the way to the end on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.<br />It will definitely save some back-and-forthing if you take notes along the way, and it was pretty easy to tell what to take note of.  The lack of any hints will make you think a little, but intuitive play helps a lot.  There is a walkthrough now-- I checked it to make sure my glitch  was in the game and not me!<br />I really enjoyed 'Lost Town' after my panic about the shield and symbols.  I LOVE the games w/o any HO scenes, and this fit the bill perfectly for me, although it seemed very short. I recommend to  folks somewhat familiar with this genre.<br />  Only 3 stars: glitch, no hints, tap response(sometimes) and scene changes slow.

B00004T9UF|4|I still remember what i was doing when i first heard this album on my cd player, i was in the back of my uncle's van, headed from sac 2 la, and the song that wasnt being played enough(the real slim shady)was the song i was headed 2 but damn, i got stuck on Stan, cuz that track was and still is eminem's best track ever, anybody who has respect 4 rap, hip hop, or music in general likes that song, or can at least respect it. this album was dope, but coming off of The Real Slim Shady LP, i was a bit disapointed, but i understand that this was The Marshall Mathers LP, and it was clearly defirent, seeing as he wasnt slim shady i understood that the music was headed towards serios over funny, the album was dope lyricly, and the beats where kool, even em inpressed me, back when i was 14-15 i thought the whole album was produced by dre, but when i found out like 2 moths ago who did what i thought the way I Am was a hella good track, not knowing it was done by em, and the other good or great tracks are Bittch Please part2, all in all a good album, it could be great or a little worse depending on what eminem album u just came off of.

B0006A9FKA|5|As one might expect, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a parodic remake of the classic George Romero film DAWN OF THE DEAD.  It pays frequent homage to the latter film through a host of direct references as well as its general subject matter (for instance, much of the \\"news\\" as read by the television presenters are lifted nearly word for word from Romero's script).  There differences are, however, marked.  Instead of an American location, this film is set in London.  And instead of holing up in a house to fight it out against the zombies, our heroes travel to a local pub.<br /><br />Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, there is no question that not everyone finds this film that funny.  I'm not sure why that is, but I thought it would be fun to bat around some theories about why the reactions have been so diverse.  This is an important exercise for prospective viewers.  Are you more likely to side with those who find this to be a highly effective and funny farce or those who simply don't find anything funny at all?  So here are my speculations:<br /><br />First, I think some of those who do not like the movie failed to realize that this is an English comedy, with a very low-key, subdued approach to the story.  Before going to see this, I think a prospective viewer should answer is whether or not they enjoy MONTY PYTHON, Hugh Grant, THE OFFICE, and other British comic productions.  If the answer is \\"Yes\\" there is a high degree of probability that you will enjoy this one.  If the answer is \\"Absolutely not!\\" then you will almost certainly dislike this one.<br /><br />Second, I think some people, hearing the basic premise, imagine that this is going to be a bit like SCARY MOVIE or some other such parody of a genre.  I know for a fact that the couple sitting behind me in the viewing I went to had expectations along these lines.  They were expecting more out and out farce, a more frenetic pace, and far more jokes and cartoonish humor.  But because SHAUN OF THE DEAD is more deliberately paced, allows the absurd tale to unfold gradually, and the jokes rationed out more gradually, they were truly upset.<br /><br />I love British humor so I definitely fall more into the class of people apt to enjoy this.  I loved the pacing and subdued reactions of the main characters.  I loved, for instance, a pair of scenes that are allowed to unfold rather slowly.  The first occurs rather early in the movie when Shaun leaves his apartment and out of sheer habit walks across the street and down the sidewalk to the local corner store where he buys a couple of items.  The very same path is followed the next morning, with Shaun without thinking (almost zombie-like?) covers the same path to the store, utterly unaware of how dramatically everything has changed, of all the people he had seen the day before who had been transformed into zombies or been killed.  They were superbly executed scenes, and it is hard to imagine any American studio allowing a scene in a zombie comedy film to unfold so nicely.<br /><br />There are many wonderful scenes in the film, some very short and some a bit longer.  I loved, for instance, the store employee who interrupted a meeting to accept a call on his cell phone.  Or the extraordinary scene later in the film when, to get through a group of zombies, the group of friends mimic the behavior of zombies in order to get past them.  Their rehearsing their imitations of zombies was one of the best scenes in the film.  Bill Nighy, who pretty much stole the show (despite being part of an ensemble cast) in LOVE ACTUALLY as the burned out rock musician, is in a number of nice moments in a regretfully small part.<br /><br />I really loved the great teamwork between stars Simon Pegg and David Frost.  Both had worked together before on TV in SPACED, and Pegg co-wrote the screenplay with director Edgar Wright, also of SPACED.  The cast as a whole is quite strong, though I did find the character of David to be just a tad too irritating.<br /><br />All in all, I really had a great time seeing this one and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.  But if overly broad, in-your-face American style farce along the lines of SCARY MOVIE is what you want, you'd better skip this one.and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.

B003XDVVO0|3|I really liked these at first, but then I started noticing that the middle of my foot, the shoe was narrow and was rubbing me and I was getting marks on my foot (they're only narrow in the middle of my foot, they are fine in the toe box and the heel).  It even was so bad that I got blisters on the side of my foot one time during a 1/2 hour walk.  Socks helped only a little (prevented blisters) but was still uncomfortable and who really wants to wear socks with crocs?  So, while these are ok, I am sticking to traditional crocs from now on.

0064471837|5|Sabriel literally returned me to reading. I was an avid reader as a youth and teen. As I progressed through higher education I read less and less for enjoyment (as I was constantly reading for work). I picked up Sabriel at the library in 1999 in the middle of writing my PhD dissertation as a much needed breather from scientific papers and research reports. Little did I know that it would essentially provide reading material for years (even still). I loved Sabriel and the writing of Mr. Nix enough that I went looking for other things authored by him. What I found on that early Internet was a list of books that had influenced him. Many were some of my favorites from my youth (Lloyd Alexander, Robert Heinlein, Susan Cooper, Ursula Le Guin, & Joan Aiken), but there were many I had never heard of.<br /><br />After a great journey through some of the old greats and newly revealed to me stuff I discovered that some of the books I enjoyed most as a child just didn't hold up very well now. So it was with a bit of trepidation that I picked up Sabriel again a few months ago to do a re-read 14 years or so after  the first time. This is a very uncharacteristic thing for me as I can count on 1 hand the books I've ever re-read. There are too many good books to be going back! I am pleased to say that 14 years was enough to remember the love I had for the book, but forget some of the details so that rereading was still a bit mysterious.<br /><br />Actual review starts here: I am one of those people who refuse to read the back of the book or book cover leaf because I don't want to have anything spoil or prejudice me before I read it for myself. Consequently my reviews are very limited on details of the book, focusing rather on how it made me feel so I don't spoil it for you. Let me just say that I like Mr. Nix's characters. Sabriel is someone that, even though she is a particular type of Necromancer,  I can relate to. She makes decisions like a real person would. Nothing puts me off a book faster than stupid characters who do things that only someone with a rock for a brain would do just to move the story along. Above all else I think this is what I enjoyed about Sabriel. I could enjoy imagining The Old Kingdom where magic not only works, but is embodied in small, smart-mouthed cats (& friendly dogs...). I believed the trials Sabriel faced because there was no sense of a sure outcome. People died while making great sacrifices, others died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. My favorite books and movies through the years have always been those that are realistic in this at least. Magic, walking dead, bells named after beings of great power that exert that power on the living and dead - all this I can accept as long as actions have realistic consequences and nobody is miraculously saved in a manner that is not feasible within the structure of the story.<br /><br />Well - I didn't do so well on the details, but trust me. Buy and read this book. As a faithful library user I rarely buy books. I've purchased two sets of this trilogy because I recommend them and loan them often. Sabriel is a true treat that has a story that is interesting from the first pages, that stays interesting throughout, that keeps the reader dreaming and imagining life \\"over the wall.\\" Indeed it is one of those books that makes me believe that someplace there may be a wall separating us from our neighbors who live a very different life.a book faster than stupid characters who do things that only someone with a rock for a brain would do just to move the story along.

Leading actresses Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham will keep you laughing, crying, and of course waiting for the next witty comeback.

If you are a Gilmore fan or just getting on the band wagon you will love every minute of the fifth season of Gilmore Girls.
B007MDB71O|4|I don't know what Disney hoped to achieve by not promoting this fun movie, but I believe they really missed the mark. There was a lot here that could have made Disney a lot of money in the long run, but they weren't concerned with it. It's like they wanted it to fail.<br />This movie is a gripping story of one man's journey to Barsoom (Mars), where he becomes a slave, then a soldier, falls in love, and is given the opportunity to rule the empire. This movie was gripping, funny, moving, and extremely well done.<br />Back when I was a kid, Disney would have jumped at the chance to throw all of their money behind the advertising, and it would have done well. I remember seeing the first trailers for this movie, and having no idea what it was about because of the title, because it looked like a futuristic story taking place on another planet, etc. What they should have explained was that this story jump started sci-fi for all the greats: Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. Disney did a great disservice to their audience, and to Edgar Rice Burroughs, who really is the grandfather of all sci-fi.<br />What people don't realize is that \\"John Carter\\" made back all of its money, just not in America. It is a great movie that too many people were afraid to see because no one knew about it. To this day, I have trouble explaining how awesome this movie is because of the poor marketing. This is a travesty! This is unacceptable! Disney needs to get it together!

B000FBJHEO|4|I read Cosmopolis because I had seen the movie (also hypnotic) and needed to get more background, as well as understand how Cronenberg used the words in the book to adapt it for a screenplay.  This is definitely one of the odder books I have read recently, but I loved the wordplay and the insight into a somewhat psychotic mind.  Yes, some of it is silly, but I think that if you can really get into Eric's head, the book is fascinating.  He is someone trying to connect to reality rather than his own inner life (the only one he has).<br />This is the first DeLillo novel I had read, so I cannot compare it to any other of his works.<br />I feel that the movie itself, Cosmopolis, was very much misunderstood and poorly reviewed.  Come on, forget that Robert Pattinson was in Twilight, and look at the movie for itself.  Cronenberg is always a fascinating director, and all of the actors were superb.  Pattinson and Giamatti towards the end of the movie are spellbinding in a ritual dance of cat and mouse (which is which, and when).<br />Overall, a little Hamlet, and a lot of 21st century zeitgeitz.

B00000DFSK|5|I'm a u2 fan. I admit that this album is a little disappointing for u2 fans who are already familiar with every song of u2. And i am also very sad that some good stuff from the earliest two albums are totally missing plus  a song like new year's day is miserably edited from its original version.  But let's get real. let's review this album from an objective point of  view. let's not complain about u2 putting out this GH or judge on which  songs should have been included. We are talking about an album which has  more or less the greatest hits of u2 in '80s. No doubt every song should be  appreciated and remembered as one of the best songs ever in rock history.  If you think joshua tree or achtung baby deserves five star, this album is  way beyond that. If you are first listening to u2, you can't help  loving  every track on this album. You will experience a breathless journey from  'desire' to 'all i want is you'.(and then take your breath and listen to  the hidden track.)

Even the incredible special effects are wasted in a hodge-podge of slice-n-dice editing that makes it impossible for all but those with ADD to follow. The story is senseless and the ending hokey as it comes...<br />Don't waste the money unless you are a die hard fan of the game or Mrs Billy Bob...and really not even then!

B002XTBE6K|5|The previous two versions of Emma (Gwenyth Paltrow and Kate Bekinsale) left me completely frustrated with the character. Romola Garai has created an Emma that is likable, maybe even lovable. Her character flaws are depicted as symptoms of her unworldliness and loneliness due to her father's terror of the outside.     The other character stories are fully developed, so the focus is not on Emma alone.      My one objection would be the casting of Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston. She and Romola Garai played romantic rivals in \\"Daniel Deronda,\\" (another Masterpiece, literally) and here she depicts Emma's governess. They are but 7 years apart in real life - she should not be playing matronly figures just yet.     The screenplay is superb, the directing divine. Charming adaptation!

B00BD99JMW|2|I really wanted to read this book so badly… and I got badly disappointed by it. The plot pretty much follows Tris and friends to their new life outside the fence but the pace of the story turns really slow unlike the previous two books.<br />Some mysteries are revealed and you learn why their world is the way it is. However, there was so much to explode that the author missed by just killing Tris in a stupid way to save her stupid brother. I actually thought that there would be more books but apparently it was just 3 and that’s it. So much didn’t make sense to me because the final was as good as written in a rush just to get done with it.<br />Overall, 2 stars is a lot… not worth it. Bad ending for a trilogy that could’ve been so much more.

I think Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play Van Helsing, but his character did not portray the originality of Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\".  They also changed his name for some reason.  It was supposed to be \\"Abraham\\" but Sommers changed it to \\"Gabriel.\\" Van Helsing should have also been portrayed as more of a scientist than a gunfighter, which was how Van Helsing was originated. <br /> <br />In this movie, Van Helsing's main nemesis is Dracula, but along the way he fights Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, and some werewolves.  His job is to kill Dracula before he lets lose all of his kids to take over the world. Of course, Helsing is armed with way-ahead-of-his-time weapons which are funded by a secret Vatican society.  That is the tree trunk of the storyline, but of course there are many more branches of obstacles throughout the movie. <br /> <br />As in all movies, some of the fight scenes are very unrealistic.  Such as when \\"whats her name\\" is thrown against the wall at full speed and she gets up just fine.  Just little glitches here and there, but nothing to ruin a pretty good movie.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good movie, but check out Sommer's \\"The Mummy\\" which is his best movie.  ENJOY! <br /> <br />John
B005V2S7FW|4|Have been using Lastpass since 2000. Takes some getting used to buy it has saved me countless hours of recovering passwords. Highly recommended for cross platform use.
B0052RDHTM|5|Very interesting historical novel with great character development.  Just re-read Fall of Giants before starting on book 2 of the Century Trilogy- I enjoyed it just as much this time.
B009YY91QC|5|I love the color and animation in this film.  I get tired of computer generated looks and long for the old school hand drawn artwork like when I grew up in the 60s.  The music is fun, the story is charming and Eva Gabor was such a great choice for Duchess.
B000T3NMYE|4|Some great standards that should be in everyone's jazz collection plus a couple of tracks that I don't remember hearing before. This was a great meeting of great musicians from the most fertile time of modern jazz.
B000BW7QWW|5|It's Firefly...what's not to love.
B00HZ2M5KE|5|Full, warm, rich and detailed. I was worried about all the things that they could do wrong to this great music, much to my surprise they did a fantastic job. Go ahead and purchase away!
B0097EWK3A|5|I liked it because it had more hidden object opportunities than most of these types of games. The clues were logical but still required some thinking. looking forward to the next one.
0399213015|5|I bought two cloth panels showing the caterpillar and the butterfly, then had to buy the book to see how the transition was done. I made a two-sided baby quilt with a stem and cocoon connecting them.
B002KQ6BT6|5|Be sure to read the book or books that precede this.  Love Dan Brown books!!!
0783225547|5|Had vhs tape of movie.  Wanted to replace the tape with a DVD so I can use it as I do not have a vhs tape player that works.
B000WC3864|5|The reviews for this edition of Evil Dead were all mostly written before the darn thing even came out!!! So don't pay any attention to them. I understand the complaints though. How many different editions of this film and countless others will Anchor Bay release before the fans revolt and turn their backs on these films and the company itself???     But this edition does come close to it being the Ultimate Edition. The only reason why it's not the \\"ultimate edition\\" is simply do to the lack of two things, not including \\"Within The Woods\\" and a new commentary with \\"the ladies of evil dead\\" Ellen Sandweiss (Cheryl), Betsy Baker (Linda), & Theresa Tilly (Shelly), and of course Richard DeManincor (Scotty). If these two things would have been included, I don't think anyone would have complained at all.      We all know that \\"Within The Woods\\" will probably never have an official release do to the fact that it contains products used in the film and the companies either refuse to allow their products to be used in a horror movie or have asked for too much money. I honestly don't know why a new commentary wasn't recorded.      This release does contain some new footage never seen before at all!!! That's pretty cool to have if you're the hardcore fan. And the fact that the film was released in it's original Fullframe version (the movie was filmed in Fullframe) and the cropped Widescreen version. The extras are so many to list but they are definately worth the $20 or so dollars folks! The packaging is also really cool too! So if you've thought about getting this film, ignore the other releases and get this version. It's close to being the true \\"definitive edition\\"!!!      renobrown
0141345659|5|You couldhve made a little more action in the book.  Overall it was an outstanding book about life.  I would try to get people to read this book because i changed my piont of veiw.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Jennifer Lawrence kills it
B0095P33IW|2|Set in WW2 Europe: the Grandkids were more interested in the lack of technology than anything else and they ended up bored and leaving the room; it was written like a mediocre comic book so I couldn't stay interested either. At least Grandpa got a good nap that afternoon.
0670033375|3|A thoroughly researched work, but one that could have been trimmed by at least 100 pages, if not more. I found myself skimming extensively, attempting to locate the more interesting passages. <br /> <br />In my view, Diamond painted far too rosy a picture in his assessment of American society, neglecting to point out the very real possibility of a huge resource and/or financial collapse in the not too distant future.
B00BH0VSM6|5|...And then read them all again.<br /><br />It was tough to wait for the first book in the series and still waiting for the second, but I've read the rest a number of times.  You can't go wrong with any of these books.  But it's a great ride when you read them in order.<br /><br />One thing I particularly like about this author: the protagonist is not a superhero.  Bulletproof cops get so old after a while - you find yourself pulling for Harry Hole and at times disliking some of the things he does.  As in real life.  And no one in these novels is sacred.  Enough said.
B006885EFE|5|Always great to watch an oldie but goodie!
B004GJDQT8|5|Very easy to use.
B00177Y9ZC|3|I read the book first and yes, this movie has little overlap as others have complained. Still a nice effort worth seeing.<br /><br />However one thing that spoilt the film for me was the scene where the 2 male stars drive through a Japanese city (Tokyo?) in a European car. The car is meant for driving on the right side of the road. But in Japan they like UK drive on the left! If you look at the background, you can see the traffic is moving on the left.<br /><br />Now you might say it's a European car so it should be as shown in the film. But no. Japan like UK requires imports to be adapted for left side driving. The scenes of closeup of the driver and passenger talking to each other have the background traffic dubbed in. I am guessing that to US watchers, this could completely pass them by. Everything seems as it should for the closeups. Better would have been the use of a left sided car. If nothing else, it subtly emphasises that they are indeed in a different country. It is obvious with the Asian backdrop; but tweaking it via a correct car gives an authentic nuance. Especially because the driver is British, so he indeed is used to that driving.
B004A8ZWVK|1|I was annoyed by the book, but I'm even more annoyed that people found it so fantastic.  All the characters were stereotypes, and none of them were well developed.  The only one who exhibited any emotion was Ms. Celia, and her story was just a sidenote.  The book had all the politically correct themes: New York Jew, good--Mississippi Christian, bad.  Working woman, good--homemaker, bad.  Poor people, good--rich people, bad.  The ugly duckling is of course the hero, and the author even threw in a passage on homosexual acceptance near the end.  The pie thing was absolutely disgusting, and infuriated me.  So this woman doesn't have the guts to stand up to her husband's beatings, but she's brave enough to do something like that?  Plus, so what if they wrote a book outing their bosses?  Skeeter benefited, but the help didn't. Their lives didn't change for the better at all, so what was the point.  I was sooo glad to be done with this, I'm tossing it straight into the trash.
B009UX2YAC|5|Ok love this game because it changes theme and I love the Rio one. They should do an African one. Well I just wanted to say I love this game bye.
B00005MAM2|5|For the uninitiated to Anime, Akira is the prototype. Everything great about Anime is here -- Rich scenes, bold action, powerful emotions and a mind-bending plot.<br />The Special Edition vocals are a departure from the old vocals, and, as other reviewers here note, are not always an improvement. The translation is also subtly different, with fewer memorable lines. However the story is easier to understand at the same time. Both versions have their high and low points...<br />The DVD transfer, BTW, is flawless -- and the soundtrack on DVD (I had worn out my VHS type) is impressive with my 5-speaker Dolby Digital setup. <br />The movie also has some of the downsides of much Anime -- some characters are cardboard cutouts, the animation has moments of lameness that appear dated followed by beautiful, flowing chase scenes. And the movie does not always make perfect sense, but then, if you are watching a movie about people who can channel pure energy, why get technical?<br />Warning for all squeamish people: This movie is NOT for you. More people die in this movie than in Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Pearl Harbor combined. (Of course, 20 million people die in the first scene, but that's beside the point...many of the deaths are graphic and my wife had a hard time watching).<br />The Special Edition includes lots of neat extras on the second disc -- trailers, making of, cool stuff about the weird instruments used to make the eerie music, and an interview with the creator, who doesn't seem to realize the enormity of his creation.
B006LSZECO|5|breathtaking novel
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is challenging if you deleted floppy bird they took it of the app store so it is pretty fun and challenging and a great replacement for floppy bird
034580404X|5|After reading the series last year I discussed it with my 96 year old mother-in-law. She saw all the hoop-la on TV and decided she wanted it for Christmas. I did have an extra book cover for her so she could keep it from &#34;those that didn't need to know what she's reading&#34;.  See! You're never too old!
B00846REIS|5|Awesome book - hot and steamy.  The tone of 50 shades seemed very smooth to me while this book is a little rougher (tone only so far).  It is rare for me to be shocked and one part of this book shocked me and I loved not knowing it was coming.  Enjoy!
B00AEJM6H2|5|Great Game.  I have to say it has been one of my favourite for a few months now.
B008K9SG9K|5|Brand new and i listened to it right when i got it. Added it straight to my phone and computer.
B00EPFEY44|4|One of his best... I want to go there
B00AQCMK32|5|An incredibly simple and addictive game, that is nearly impossible to put down once you pick it up. Ended up playing for 6 hours after purchasing, and yet it only seemed like 30 mins. imagine my surprise when I looked up and saw rays of sunlight pouring through the window.<br /><br />I believe &#34;Easy to play, challenging to master&#34; would sum this game up perfectly. This really is a must own! Plus, it's extremely affordable! I am now eager to check out some of Kairosofts other titles!<br /><br />It has simple block graphics, and while I normally hate games that try to capture that &#34;Retro&#34; feel by using bitart, I have to admit that this time? Totally adds to the charm!
B00GSAC1UI|5|Just an amazing CD that will definitely put you in the Spririt!  The vocals are absolutely amazing and the renditions are updated but not too much.  I can't believe it is Acapella.  Pentatonix is cream of the crop!

B000BUYP4Q|5|As a small child, Bruce Wayne witnesses the murder of his multi-millionaire father and mother in an alley. Thankfully before their death, they imbedded Bruce with good teachings to make him a good man when he grows up. Later on in life, as a young man, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) comes back to Gotham City seeking revenge on the man that killed his parents. When plans don't go accordingly, and also when he lets someone know what his intentions were, he realizes that his path for doing good for the city, isn't the correct path to do it in. So he leaves Gotham to escape and to find his way. And then a man by the name of Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds Bruce and tells him of a secret place that will teach him to fight for justice, but he must get there alone. When Bruce gets there, he begins his training in martial arts, ways of the ninja, and fighting what he fears most. After 7 years, Bruce finally returns to a Gotham City that is slowly falling into the bad guys hands. And Bruce takes it upon himself to help rid Gotham of the bad. To make them fear what he fears. To make them face Batman. As Batman begins to clean up the city, he finds out about a plan that will destroy Gotham City schemed up by Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) and someone from his past. A toxin that will make everyone go crazy is about to be released in Gotham and Batman is the only one that can stop it.<br /><br />After some really bad Batman sequels (4 and 5 in particular), the franchise seemed to have been shot like a race horse with a broken leg. How could you ever come back from nipples on the bat suit? And then Christopher Nolan steps up and says \\"Hey yo, WB, I'm bout to hit you up the side of the head with a sweet Batman cause you know, I did Memento and Insomnia\\". Ok he didn't really say that, but he did promise them greatness, and greatness was delivered. While at first you think Batman starts off a little slow, you have to realize that we are delving into the persona of Batman himself. The reasons why he became the bat. The way he learned to fight the way he does. And to realize the biggest thing of all... that Batman is just a man. He has no super powers. He gets hurt just like the rest of us, except his been in some rigorous training to help ignore a lot of the pain. And it's great to see the two separate entities when it comes to Bruce and the Bats. Batman is the true man now, while Bruce is just the disguise that hides him. While Batman is fighting crime and avenging justice, Bruce is the cocky and fun playboy millionaire that no one would suspect is Batman. Christian Bale was great as both. I still think Michael Keaton is my favorite Bruce though because he just has a `coolness' about him, but Christian was definitely great also and is my favorite Batman, even with his kind of weird Batman voice.<br /><br />Christian Bale isn't the only awesomeness going on here in this movie either. Gary Oldman plays, perfectly, Detective Gordon. Even down to the look of him in the graphic novel `Batman: Year One'. Oldman usually plays bigger roles, but man I'm glad he played Gordon. Just perfect. And then you have Alfred, the butler/second father, played, well, once again, perfectly, by Michael Caine. Morgan Freeman is even here, playing Lucius Fox, a man that works in the `basement' of Wayne Tower inventing and making up some insane items for the military, that Batman eventually uses for himself. Think of `Q' for James Bond. Crooked smile Katie Holmes plays Bruce's best friend and love interest Rachel Dawes. She's also a woman that holds her own and tries to bring down the bad guys through the justice system. She's ok I guess.<br /><br />Some of the extras on the 2 disc were great. I knew Bale just got done making `The Machinist', and was Ethiopian like skinny for that movie, so I was amazed he got huge again for Batman in such a quick time. I mean it's hard for me to just lose 10 pounds. What I didn't know what that when Christopher Nolan told him to get as bigas he could, Bale did just that. He got fat. So fat that Chris was baffled and thought he'd never lose the weight in time. Some of the crew would tell Bale \\"What are we making again? Fatman?\\" So Bale had cut up the weight he regained. Crazy! Watching the scenes where he is learning to fight, you can tell he was still losing some weight, but he's still thick. They really didn't think the suit was going to fit him...hehe. Also the scene where Bruce and Henri Ducard are fighting on the frozen lake by the glacier was crazy. They had to rush that scene with almost no preparation. After they were done filming, the next day the lake became unfrozen and was a lake again. Talk about lucky. There was a lot of good stuff on those discs that will keep you busy for awhile. When you see what they did to make Gotham City, you'll be blown away. Talk about some work.<br /><br />Even though the movie does have some hokey scenes in it, such as the rooftop Batmobile scenes, it really doesn't hurt the movie at all for me. Great movie. Plain and simple. I thought nothing could beat it, but I was wrong when Dark Knight came out. So make sure you watch this first before Dark Knight...heh. Own it. Own it. Own it. And make sure you own it in HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.<br /><br />P.S. - Some of you know I'm reviewing my DVDs in order because it gives me something to do. How did I go from Be Cool to Batman!?!? Bad Matt...bad.<br /><br />P.P.S - I'm a top 1000 reviewer now! YAY!as he could, Bale did just that. He got fat. So fat that Chris was baffled and thought he'd never lose the weight in time.

Watching the scenes where he is learning to fight, you can tell he was still losing some weight, but he's still thick. They really didn't think the suit was going to fit him...hehe.

B00HDMMISA|5|Liane Moriarty produced another winner.  Her easy style of writing allows the reader to really get to know the characters.  She spins her web and you don't even realize it!  At times I chuckled, other times I gasped, but my attention was held the whole time.  No blood and gore here, but great suspense and always the twist at the end. Great read!  You'll want to read it over, to see what you missed the first time!
B000VMFDW2|5|This book is not for the faint at heart. A true story of human endurance against the odds of fanatical foes. Survival and sanity at its limit.A very compelling account of the battleground as witnessed by the author. Surprising personal confessions of the the soldiers stress under fire.
B0045TYDNC|5|fit, as expected.<br /><br />Ya gotta love the consistency of both Amazon and Nikon. Makes perfect sense to purchase Nikon equipment from an organization like Amazon. When I buy my photo gear ( always Nikon) I know that (for the most part) the really important pieces are going to be interchangeable amongst my existing camera bodies and accessories. That's consistency.<br /><br />I also know that when I place an order, particularly a Prime order, with Amazon, what I receive is exactly what I ordered, exactly when I expected it - that's consistency.

B000683VI4|5|I love the film. It was very inspiring, romantic and also somewhat poignant film. I have read the book and it made me cry. Very few people are capable of loving that way. Sadly, there are very few of them. I highly recommend the film for the romantics.

142313494X|4|On a field trip with his sixth grade class, New Yorker Percy Jackson accidentally vaporizes his math teacher. Strange things have been happening to him his entire life, but this one seems to take the cake. About to be expelled from yet another school, he returns home in the summer, and, with his mother, goes to visit Long Island. One night disaster strikes, and Percy's mom tells him to head for Camp Half-Blood.    While at the strange camp, Percy discovers that he is the son of one of the Greek gods. His strange behavior, trouble in school, severe dyslexia, and ADHD can be traced to his roots - he is a great fighter, and it seems that his brain is wired to read ancient Greek rather than English. While at the camp, he befriends two campers: Grover, a satyr who observed him at his boarding school, and Annabelle, a daughter of Athena.     All is not well in the world of the Olympians. Someone has stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt, and if it is not returned by the summer solstice, war will erupt between the gods. Percy suspects that Hades is behind the theft, and he and his friends are assigned a quest to track down the bolt from the Underworld (which, ironically, is located in Los Angeles). Along the way they face mosters, Furies, as well as several other gods, including Ares, as they attempt to right the world of the gods and prevent war. But is Hades truly behind the theft? And will someone betray Percy as he tries to complete his quest?    \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is the first of five books written by Rick Riordan that combines a modern-day hero with Greek mythology. It's cute, engaging, and portrays the gods in a real-world light. But I couldn't help comparing it to that other series of books with a modern hero - Harry Potter - and this one comes up slightly short. Still, it's a great page-turner and a wonderful way to look at the world from a Greek point of view.
0553801503|1|What a disappointment!  Martin's lame explanation at the end (what a relief!) of \\"Feast\\" did nothing to appease the disgust and frustration I felt almost immediately upon beginning the book and everything to reinforce my decision that I, for one, will not be reading any more \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" books. <br /> <br />Martin succeeded in his cheap attempt to crank out a mindnumbingly lackluster collection of words. <br /> <br />I took pity on  his characters, not for the misfortunes that befell them in the book, but for being used so badly by their creator. <br /> <br />Cross Martin off my list of authors to read!
B007MNV5WU|5|I got this for my Kindle when it first came out. It's definitely a worthy addition to the Angry Birds family of games. The \\"space physics\\" of gravity and inertia are integrated quite well, and the new abilities of the birds were quite fun.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it was over much too quickly. I was able to get three stars on all the levels -- plus all the golden asteroids -- in just a few days, playing it only at night before going to bed.<br /><br />Still, when you think about it, $3 for a few days of fun is not a bad deal at all. And it looks like there may be more levels coming in the future.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like Angry Birds on your Kindle, you're likely to enjoy this one too.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, now that more episodes have been released, this one's got plenty of length to it. Very fun stuff.
B001UV4XFG|5|I absolutely LOVED Eclipse!!! It was definately the best one out of the Saga. The fight scene was great, they didn't go overboard with the special effects, so that was good. This is the first movie out of all 3, that I want to go back and see it again very soon. I hope they keep this director for Breaking Dawn too! He did an awesome job.
B0000DD7LB|3|O.K. I haven't liked Britney in awhile, but I bought this C.D. the day it came out. It's not anything great, but if you liked her old stuff such as &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;, there's no doubt that you will like this. &quot;Toxic&quot; is probably the best track on the album, but stay clear of &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot; and &quot;Showdown&quot;. I think she needs to start trying some new types of music on her next C.D. though because this one is like the last few. I couldn't give it a higher rating even though I am a Britney fan, because it is obvious she doesn't posess much talent. If you want to hear talent, buy Christina Aguilera's 'Stripped' C.D. I promise you woun't be let down.
B007PT3QOQ|5|love it!,very addictive
B001VS46DC|4|This DVD is not quite as compelling as Live in Paris.  It is not as romantic, nor is the orchestra as incredible.  However, it is still a wonderful concert and well worth the money.
B000002TQV|5|and since I'm already halfway there, I'm way out of the band's demographic.  Bought this in early '96 and still listen to it at least twice a month.  I put this one ahead of OK Computer.  You kids can have Kid A and Amnesiac.  For us older folks who usually only rock out in the car, listening to Kid A is like taking a valium... do not drive or operate heavy machinery.  The Bends, on the other hand, is a masterpiece.  It was the Revolver of the 90's.  The musicianship and production are unparalleled, and the range of moods coupled with wild stylistic changes from track to track make this a must have CD regardless of what your tastes in music are.
B0011QC9U6|5|This movie is phenomenal, top to bottom.  The story, performances and execution are essentially flawless.  There isn't a dull moment.  Reviews of this movie were mixed mostly because of the digital execution, but anyone who is not afraid of technology will simply be astounded scene after scene.  The 3D experience was one I will never forget and now that I own it in HD, it is one of the most frequently watched movies in my collection.
B00ADS98FC|5|Hilarious! Every time I watch I can't help but laugh. Great for music lovers. One of those movies that stay funny every time it gets watched.
B00B5AAW52|5|I love it.

B000002KON|5|Hoo boy! List the twenty albums that I have listened to more than any others in the last thirty or so years and this album will be there (along with several Beatles albums, Blonde on Blonde, Let it Bleed, etc.). This is the Kinks at their best. I bought this album on the basis of a positive review when it came out and, boy, am I glad that I did. Always more popular in the USA than in the UK, this album was embraced by yanks because of its highly melodic and tightly arranged songs about England in happier days. Few bands played this well. Few composers could turn out songs the way that Ray Davies did. Still brings a smile to my face when I hear one of these songs. Highly recommended.

I realized what this means.<br /><br />This is what girlhood is.<br /><br />And, really, underneath all of the middle-age self-misery and careless, wistful affairs with older art professors, \\"Cat's Eye\\" is all about how a woman's girlhood shapes the way she lives the rest of her life.

We never want to cause those real wounds, but by God, we all did.<br /><br />Elaine Risley, a controversial painter, has returned to Toronto to attend a retrospective devoted to her work. While back in the city, Elaine reflects on her relationships and friendships she had as a child and teenager, especially the one she had with a girl named Cordelia, whose influence followed Elaine for her entire life.<br /><br />We see Elaine make a bold transition from a tomboyish little girl who traveled with her family all over Canada for her father's science career to a clueless school-aged girl who is thrust suddenly into the world of other school-aged girls. Girl culture is a prominent theme in this novel, the culture of fashion scrapbooks and makeup and stealing things from drugstores, of dating etiquette and relationships with brothers, of knowing your place in the hierarchy of female friendship. Atwood knows, as all women do, that the cruelest people on this plant are young girls. If you have ever been a female between the ages of 9 and 18, you have survived hell. This is also a novel that touches on human consumerism, a theme popular in many of Atwood's environmental/sci-fi novels--Elaine realizes that she needs things; she needs purses and nightgowns and makeup. In the crux of her relationship with these three cruel girls--Grace, Carol, and the worst perpetrator, Cordelia--Elaine starts consuming herself, chewing on her hair, biting the skin around her nails and the hard flesh on the bottoms of her feet. Elaine stays with these girls because as we all know, a childhood spent with awful friends is better than a childhood spent alone, especially for girls. There is a part of the novel where after the girls pick on Elaine, Elaine takes all of her hard-earned babysitting money, quits her babysitting job, and spends all the earnings on candy, which she gives to the girls. They consume it, and in a way, Elaine feels consumed, and she mistakes this for love. Girlhood literally eats away at a child until she is nothing but the product of her environment.<br /><br />Elaine hardens to this girl culture, becomes a sharpened and bored high-school girl with a \\"mean mouth,\\" not impervious to this culture of catty women but simply afraid of it. The most emotional parts of the novel are when Elaine recalls events with her older brother Stephen, when times were simpler and she could focus on the hands-on activities and tasks she liked without having to worry about what she looked like from behind or how she spoke. Elaine doesn't really trust women but she doesn't really trust men either--the hurts inflicted on her from those girls when they were kids destroyed her ability to trust anyone.<br /><br />This book is the \\"cat's eye\\" of Elaine's life, the entire scope of her experience, and it is an interesting read with rich detail, full of Atwood's sharp eye for the realities of being a girl. That is part of the problem, though--these characters are just like you and me, too similar, until you wait and wait for a climax and nothing ever really happens. This just isn't a very exciting book, which is disappointing, because many of Atwood's novels have left me completely breathless. I understand her growth and change as a writer--I am much more fond of her later novels than her earlier ones. Even though this was an ambitious, well-written work of a fiction, I guarantee I will forget almost everything about it within a month, because it was a hyper-realistic account of a person's experience--it wasn't really a story. I also know that some people really love this. I totally get it. It just wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />I'd still recommend it, though, and I think it might be interesting to read as a teenager and then again as an adult. I wonder if I will read this again someday and see if any of those girlhood wounds have healed.
B00VRYCGLO|5|Fun game<br />Lots of different levels
B00CBRAD2A|4|Lots of action with cool car, cool guns, and typical Arnold moves.  This was a good return for the Govanator to action movies.
B004LLDN3A|5|My 9 year can not stop watching this movie. Great songs that she even sings around the house. even tho it was made 50 years ago the magic of Mary Poppins is still there..no extras needed.
B00BWBHIUG|5|Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Fantastic. Engaging for adults and simple for children. May even be a little educational!
B00K0MM4AM|1|The only thing going for this movie is Scarlett Johnansson gets naked. Other than that it is the most boring 106 minute movie that has EVER been made! I feel sorry for all the people who put money into making this boring piece of drivel.
B005T87QCI|4|Needs to have a few more options available; having different players and levels. My 4yr old and 8 yr old love this app and have had it for over a month- and still love it. The biggest draw back is the shadow boxing they do once the game is over. They love Real Steel.
B002HWUU1I|4|The songs aren't quite as memorable as the Once album, but a very pleasant album.
B00MXILU3S|5|Christmas gift for my husband..He will love it!
B00H58VGIA|5|A good read.  Real persons living with the perils of slavery and the dangers of unwelcome, opposite opinions. Plus a history lesson.
B0000DZ3EA|5|wow, peter gabriel has once again made an excellent album. eventhough this album is almost all previously released material, i personally think he chose all of his best work. the sound is well mixed and clear. i give it 5 stars!!!!
B006VRDZ44|5|Exciting. Keeps you interested
B00785P2QC|5|I llllllllooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeee this game it is awesome.  I love it . it is almost educational.  its fun. its a wonderful game.
B002HWRYJE|4|Star Trek (Single-Disc Edition) tough one, as a star trek fan I liked it they did a good job, but some may find it crud
B000AJIF4E|5|These headphones are legendary.  I got these because they were recommended by my teacher for sound engineering.  There are others a lot more expensive, i did not get to compare them, but I really don't need to, this works great.  You can hear everything, this is great for mixing or listening for errors in your music or just listening to music in general.  You will hear a lot of detail on these that you won't hear with other headphones or regular speakers.  It also slightly cancels the surrounding noise even though they are not noise canceling headphones.  They are not extremely bass heavy so if you boost the bass too much it will distort (but that's not what they're designed for anyways).  This is an all around great product, it does what it's designed to do.
B001NLL93W|5|The books just keep getting better and better. I`ve been hooked from the start and I can`t wait for the next book.<br />...Oh and (SPOLIER ALERT(sorta))... Has anyone else figured out that Simon is a daylighter because he drank Jace`s blood. While under normal circumstances, this wouldn`t be very special, it is because Jace has... wait for it... a little longer... ANGEL BLOOD! (GASP) Yes, I am fairly certian that the ANGEL BLOOD! is what did this. And dont say i didn`t warn you. There was a disclaimer before this spolier.
B00J7XDLPM|5|and I love poultry rain<br />seems stupid but fighting with chicken is really fun ^-^<br /><br />and the way the touch screen answers my moves is far better that what I have tested on other games<br />so I like it !
B00J924YC0|5|Great CD. Lindsey is awesome in concert as well. I would highly recommend seeing her when you get a chance.
0679879269|5|Easily one of the best books I've ever read.  Pullman puts just about every other author to shame.  Just be prepared for the end, I'll say no more.
B005ZBBKHQ|4|First I have to say that the music included in this collection deserves 10 stars, but you probably already know that. This review is for the packaging of this 5cd set. The slipcase is nice enough, though the photo is from the wrong time period (1997-2000 or thereabouts.) Just be aware that the individual albums are packaged in nice cardstock slipcases, not really replica mini lp sleeves. Lyric booklets are nice, too, but are in line with the standard cd releases and are not replicas of the inserts or lyric sheets that came with the original vinyl releases. I'm happy with this purchase because I got it at a bargain price, just don't pay inflated prices expecting something that it's not.
B001E45XT4|5|Just what I need I love them. For 30 bucks you cant beat what you get. I used to use some old apple headphones. Looking back I'm glad i bought these Cord is 6 feet long and the bass in these headphones is amazing love them
B00PTB7B34|5|This is a great twist on the clash of clans style gameplay.  Epic COD Heroes makes this unique.
B003K1EYM6|5|Absolutely great for transferring pictures from camera to iPod or iPad
B003E74B24|5|A wonderful read! Entertaining and interesting at the same time. It gave me new insight on one of my favorite celebrity chefs. I loved it!
B00992CF6W|5|I like it but the computer kind has all animals and so I'm going to save up and buy a computer.
B000002NJS|5|In terms of popular music of the late 20th century? Madonna's creative MO has always been best defined for me as challenging. Musically,personally and in many cases spiritually. She'd spent much of the 1990's doing exactly that,and gleefully taking her admirers/listeners along for the ride. During the middle of the decade? Life changed for her. She got married,divorced and had her daughter. One thing I remember about the year 1998 actually had a lot to do with the same concept. Musically there was a transition from the angrier punk style of alternative music to a trancier,more psychedelic one. For me? This was a very appealing transition. It was through the BMG music club about a year after this came out that I picked it up there. And each time I hear it? A new level of greatness emerges from it.<br /><br />  &#34;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&#34; is an ambient melodic delight that builds from instrumentally featherweight to heavyweight between each part. &#34;Swim&#34; is a bluesy electronic/hip-hop/dance number with some gurgling bass effects and rhythm guitar. The title song is a Hi NRG electronica/disco number that,like &#34;Sky Fits Heaven&#34;,&#34;Skin&#34; and the slower dub reggae style of &#34;Shanti/Ashtangi&#34; emphasis extremely tribal,Afrocentric rhythms within their arrangements. &#34;Candy Perfume Girl&#34;,&#34;Nothing Really Matters&#34;,&#34;The Power Of Goodbye&#34;,&#34;To Have And Not To Hold&#34; and the beautiful Arabic style of &#34;Frozen&#34; are all slower trip hop type rhythms. &#34;Little Star&#34; is an easy going drum n bass type number with a round bass line while &#34;Mer Girl&#34; is a hauntingly orchestrated ballad closer.<br /><br />  To use one of the biggest cliche among writers and critics? This album is Madonna's Sgt. Peppers. And I say that with every bit of honesty and sincerity I can possibly manage. None of the musical territory Madonna explored here was totally new and innovative when this came out. What she did in the company of producers such as Patrick Leonard,Marious De Vries and especially William Orbit was to create a melodically and lyrically vivid world which could match the musical nervous system this created. You can dance to this,but it's far from easy pop. Love,loss,birth,death,fear and joy all weave throughout this album in a way I really never quite heard from Madonna after or since. In a way? It was the creative culmination of where she'd been heading from 1982 to this point. And in many ways her finest album length statement to date.the company of producers such as Patrick Leonard,Marious De Vries and especially William Orbit was to create a melodically and lyrically vivid world which could match the musical nervous system this created.

B000683VI4|5|One of the sweetest, most romantic, realistic movies I've seen in a very long time.  I've watched it about 15 times and enjoy it each time as if it is the first time.
B003K16P3M|4|Every book has it downs no matter how good the author is, but I couldn't get past a couple of points long enough to care.  1- the female lead is strong, smart, adaptable. 2- there is no love at first sight. 3- there is no silly, stupid, unneeded love triangle. In many young adult books I have picked up the heroine is quite honestly stupid. She makes decisions based on her own wants and when repeatedly confronted with the negative consequences continues to do what she does. Also there is always some love triangle incorporated that does nothing to enhance the story line. I really enjoyed this book for the concept, strong heroine, and quality of the writing. The story progressed nicely and I wasn't once left asking the question, why is she so dumb? Definitely recommend this book to people that are tired of the trends created by Twilight and those that are looking for a young adult book written as if for adults.
B0047SHEAK|4|Quite honestly, we picked this movie on a night when we preferred something brainless; something that we thought we wouldn't have to use our brains too much to watch. Although the acting was not top-notch, we were pleasantly surprised by the plot; that it actually told a story. If you like a good alien action flick, this may just suit.
B00C7KYXHW|4|Enjoyable and addicting- Lecter and Will do an incredible job acting. Need patience - but it's worth it -true to Harris's characters.
B000957O82|2|Wow.  What a let down.  After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie.  I saw it last night and almost fell asleep.  I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie.  I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film.  Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks.  Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.  I'm sorry to disagree with you all, - this was a big waste of time.
B00G5G7EXY|5|My Granddaughter loves this movie and knows all the words to, &#34;Let It Go&#34;!
B009RI4FRU|5|The kids kissing on the beach is a little racy for us but funny as well. We laughed well into the night on this one.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Good action movie.  Kept my attention all the way through.  Good twists and turns to the plot.  Enjoyed the fact that while there was violence aplenty, there was no gratuitous violence, sex, or unnecessary profanity.  I'd watch it again!
B00003CX9Q|5|Oh,it was released in 1982,8 years before I born,I can call it \\"a old movie\\", I had never seen it before, and my parents were never mentioned it, maybe they forgot. And just the other day, I felt bored and watched my favorite movie channel \\"Sci-Fi\\", just find this movie, and I was cried at two points, one is E.T.'s \\"dead\\", another one is E.T. back to home. It's a very moving movie,and it's a great movie!
0439023521|5|This book takes a good look at the route our culture is taking, turning murder into a sport for live entertainment. Couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to finish this series.
B000003N7F|5|No need to say anything ;)  Who doesn't love John Coltrane.  No issues with this vinyl during shipping.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was a great book. I cried laughed and was thrilled with the outcome. Such a cute story about cancer
159315724X|5|I thought the name was familiar.  Evidently I purchased and read this book a few years ago.  It's rare that I even read a book without a highlighter in my hand.  The other day I realized that I had already purchased the hard copy several years ago so it's like a really great review and reminder.
B004YSDRC2|4|Great example of the Doctor's intellect triumphing over brute force and evil conquering aliens!  Lots of interesting twists to maintain the viewer on the edge of their seat.      I found the ending a bit un-Whovian, as the Doctor isn't normally one to ignore loose ends, especially when someone is in need.  That's the only reason this gets 4 stars versus 5.    Great season opener!  Can't wait to see more!
B00785P2QC|5|great game that you don't want to put down. build a city, watch it grow and meet the goals. its all in your hands.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This looks exactly like Flappy Bird and is available for android finally so I guess it's cool. Unfortunately Flappy Bird is now deleted
B00KSLQSCU|5|Random heroes 2 is the ultimate sequel to random heroes in which you fight alien zombie robot things attempting to take over the world. The guns are a bit over priced but not so much. I highly recommend this game to all those people out there who like Noodlecake games. By tabbygamer
B0034G4OUY|5|great
B00IX9UTLU|5|Loved this book!  I love the way the story was wrapped up in the end.  I fell in love with Alayna and Hudson.  I'll read it over and over again!
B005EGXTEE|4|On the whole I enjoyed the book. Where then film failed to inspire and draw you in, the book did the opposite. It brought colour and flavour to the characters and I found myself drawn into the world of the arena. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
0385347774|4|It was a cliff hanger until the end....which I did not like at all.  But the author is very skillful in the &#34;whodunit&#34; aspect of the book and I do recommend it.
B0076DELIG|3|This was not the best Bosch book I have read but still keep me interested.  Maybe Harry is at end of his run.
B000FCKC4C|5|Excellent story. Great message.
0440238609|4|Before i rattle on endlessly about the polar bear, Iorek, i'm going to try and write a review.  <br /> <br />The way the books are written really do give off a \\"dark\\" feeling from the get-go, but that may have just been me. Mainly about a girl named Lyra, but with a good amount of other charcters sprinkled in. And a polar bear, i mentioned that, right? The characters are complex and um, realistic, if you don't mind the fact some bears actually talk, as well as these familar-things i can't explain well. Oh and angels, and these mammoth like things that biuld houses. But even they are believeable. <br /> <br />This trilogy really is quite similar to other 'many worlds to travel to' books, but it's done oh so much better. But it's complicated so it's hard to summerize, not that i've ever really tried that.  <br /> <br />But aside from it all, the polar bear, Iorek, probably made me give this book four stars instead of 2. That chacter made me turn a blind eye to the other flaws. He's awesome. i shall shut up now.  <br /> <br /> <br />All good things come from those who wait, but you could always GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND GO FIND THEM! <br />-Unknown, but thanx.
B00VFTA70I|5|Great acting and story.
B008SAZHLQ|4|At first I thought this book was drawn out and a bit annoying, but after finishing I realized that the author did a great job when it comes to capturing the attitudes and actions of teenagers. Furthermore, the revelation near the end of the novel about the writing on Eleanor's book really shed more light (or darkness?) on her being guarded, since the environment she was in was far worse than we'd thought due to underlying and unspoken hardships and threats that were a constant in her world.<br /><br />The uncertainty and need for repeated confirmation in Eleanor and Park's romance was getting on my nerves at one point but when I thought about it, I think the author has it right and it's shocking that many of these aloof behaviors and self-conscious actions are wildly present in us as teenagers, but even still as adults too. It drove me crazy how Park and Eleanor both cared deeply for each other, and knew the other felt the same, but still had moments of awkwardness, uncertainty, and even put up walls. Again, this is something that spans beyond teenage years but is more prevalent then.<br /><br />Also, the intensity they have for each other, that grew from adorable and humble beginnings (and comic books) is spot on for their age and I love how well it's captured in this novel. I think most people can think of at least one person we thought was the absolute greatest but were still afraid to fully let them have all-access to more of the person we were/are.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for a young romance story because couples I know who've been together for decades and they still flirt, smile, romance, and try to win each other over. They seem to have never lost that little spark of teenage love-sickness and it's fantastic!!<br /><br />While there is a great story in this book, it's mostly a character-driven novel and despite their quirks, annoying aloofness, uncertainty, and struggles, I think you'll love Eleanor & Park.
B000FFJYCU|5|This is one of my favorite movies of all I. I couldn't wait for them to come out with this in DVD and now I have it Excellent.
B000069AUI|3|besides &quot;politik&quot; and &quot;in my place&quot;, no songs really stood out on this cd. i was a bit dissapointed with it, but only because i had such high expectations after listening to &quot;Parachutes&quot;. it is still a good album though, and definatly worth buying.
B004HFON7K|5|Got this blu ray + digital copy ob Amazon for $3.99. That's a great price for this movie and it got shipped to me fast. Wont hesitate to buy more blu rays from Amazon.
B00QROI70S|5|Really fun
B007K3JFUQ|3|A movie about superhero named Sherlock, who has the power to slow down time and be able to react to events faster than anyone else, thus making him appear to have superhuman capabilities. Sort of like the characters in The Matrix.<br /><br />The storyline flows well and is of a decent enough pace to keep the viewers interest throughout. Trouble is, I wasn't sure when the comedy was intentional and when it was due to unbelievable script writing.<br /><br />For example; a scrap of thick paper with a wine stain on it would lead many to deduce that the note on it was written hastily in a restaurant on whatever material the author had to hand. To Sherlock it means, that there is a printing shop nearby which contains a wine cellar. And yes, so there is. The powers of deduction and heroic deeds could have been written by the Monty Python crew at times.<br /><br />The characters are quiet shallow, and at no time did I feel like I had any sympathy for their situation nor did I concern myself that there was ever any danger of anyone important being seriously harmed anyway.<br /><br />Stephen Fry as Mycroft adds to the Monty Python feel to the movie, only trouble is MP did it better some 40 years ago.<br /><br />As I said, an enjoyable romp with a sufficiently storyline that it holds one's interest for the majority of the film. But if you want new Sherlock Holmes, get the series 'Sherlock' from the BBC. A more original and almost believable take on the SH stories and with characters that have personalities which one can care about.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.
B007PT3QOQ|5|this is the most awesome game I have ever played and you will never find a game like this one
B00AREIAI8|5|This app is amazing! It is great for my kids to play on long car rides and it passes time away quickly. I think this is a great app.
