B007EA6R0Q|4|Worked great. Was tight getting five bikes onto the rack but it worked out. We just had to do a little jiggling. :)
B00ABW68OE|3|No good for Escalade ESV (long body). I had to exchange with 28273 model.
B002FY2AU2|5|Excellent product (and prompt shipping)!  I was very impressed!
B00HHRITFM|5|Very nicely done, nice addition to the tool box. Adhesive is a good bond to a glossy surface. Hasnt faded yet.
B000C7WVC6|5|great part thank
B000QDHENM|1|This is the biggest piece of junk around. Extremely hard to use, leaks terribly when pouring from it, AND after 4 months of use, the inside part of the spout slipped out. Now it's useless.
B0014JUHA4|5|Excellent quality and looks great
B00FTAZPDI|5|As good as the OEM product. Amazing !!
B00J5POWX2|5|PERFECT fit.  You won't even need the sun visors to hold it in place.
B0068ERZ14|1|This thing was flat and useless after one days use. Very unsatisfied with it for paying what I paid for it.
B00L847FHS|5|Great product fast shipping
B004940ZNK|5|Easy to install - works perfectly.
B001P29X4G|4|1989 jeep XJ amazon said it doesn't fit...It does. installation was quick maybe, 10 mins after taking the grill and head light housing off. high beams are brighter then before, headlights are brighter (not like drop dead brighter but mildly brighter). So I'm happy with it....just time to find brighter sealed beams. only thing I hold against it is one of the connections was a bit loose but nothing i couldn't fix.
B00JOY6U7U|4|If they work I will be happy
B007HE9YHW|4|Melted on top rack of dishwasher odd for a quality brand
B00KSQF6EQ|5|This is my first helmet so my opinion may or may not mean a lot - but for me, Medium, it is comfortable! And easy to get on/off and operate the vents and the sun visor- i have tried on other modular helmets and didn't like the feel, but this one is good, for me anyway!
B000KE163Q|5|This came in on time & loved it.  Got so many compliments on it.
B0042FTHRG|4|They have been ok so far. ..one of them went out on me less than a year but amazon was quick to replace it. ..thanks so much awesome service and product
B0069RNNPM|5|Yes I liked it very much
B013HNIK9E|5|Installation was easy with all of the information and a repair manual with electrical schematics. Great value for price. The cost was very reasonable and it works absolutely great! Does everything I need it to do, but what's important is to find someone who can install it properly. I'll definitely purchase again, even though I gave it to a friend, whose car was broken into. She said, she can now sleep much better, because the alarm system will notify her, if anyone is tampering with her vehicle. Once installed, it works great. The remote works from 50+ yards. Flashes the lights when locked and unlocked. A good purchase so far. Will update if it fails soon. I purchased this Universal keyless entry system by Flexion to replace a 7 year old keyless entry system that stopped working.
B00MR94KQW|3|Very Cheap Plastic, I really don't see this holding up too long without breaking or cracking.
B00702LPMI|2|Didn't like the lashes.  When the wind blew lashes, they made scratches on hood. Had to remove them
B00KAL67KQ|5|Just what I wanted.
B009PQ9LNC|5|fit like it was supposed to
B001GMX92W|5|All fits well to Murano. Good installation instruction on youtube.
B000COS8FI|5|Very accurate and easy to use
B00538TU8C|1|It broke after a few days
B00H7R2R28|1|This item  was very cheaply  made😕
B0047D2FWM|5|Great purchase. Very good product.
B005GQ6O94|3|I expected more.  The mats fit fine, but I thought there a spout that dispelled water.
B00HOJRGPW|5|Received booklet in a timely manner and was the right one.
B00080QHMM|5|works great!!
B000COBXBE|5|Perfect fit for my 05 altima.
B000NW4OPC|5|Part was exactly what I needed.
B00QRHDIPY|5|have not had time to really get to know how well it works or holds up but did test it and does work as described
B00Q3CL4EA|3|Didn't fit my vehicle as stated. Waiting to hear about refund or replacement. It's been month since I bought it.
B003Z49L2G|3|Berry good But the soft gone   don't last long time.
B00AQ4VNWO|5|Item as described, very fast shipping, good price
B00KGJ9AEC|5|It is fantastic help in traffic, and brings a lot of smiles...
B0006JLSN8|5|very good product
B001FAGLAM|5|No problems
B00CKZMEPW|5|MY FRIEND GET A BIG KICK OUT OF IT.
B001Q8HF9E|5|Replaced IH-Navistar  pn 355115C1 air filter perfectly at less than 1/2 the dealer price. Just have to use plastic diverter from OE filter
B0083VBK6G|1|Don't waist your money on this kit. The quality is very poor. I screwed one of the jets in and the side of it broke. It wasn't over tighten or anything barely had it seated. Now I can't get it out if I needed to.
B00069CN2I|5|Excellent on time and what I wanted
B001C6Q870|5|It was the correct one and I can open my rear glass
B009X3U2FS|5|was exactly what i was hoping for genuwine RED trd badging.. paint on the &quot;R&quot; had a few bubbles in em, but over all.. excellent!
B00RPGWE9C|5|Perfect fit for my F150 Crew Cab - really good quality, fits nicely.
B006B26F7S|5|stopping is easy when you have pads
B00IMUC9YA|5|Every time someone see my steering wheel I have to come back and order them one.  It is so very attractive and chic! Luv it luv it luv it!
B000IYIWDU|2|The clip on the sensor was broken. It still worked with a little duct tape though.
B001DMFOI2|5|as advertised.  New in box.
B00J8W5Z9C|5|Awesome fit
B00062YSJQ|1|Terrible does not work, don't waste your money!
B001QUHFQA|5|All good A+
B00CO85X94|5|I needed a new key chain for my Scion. This is pretty and colorful and does not like a little peace in their live. Thank you.
B00K8WO768|5|extremely bright light with a strong magnet. I still have yet to find out how long the batteries last, but well worth the 12 bucks. It is better than my head lamps. I did get a lanyard and and clip it to that if I want sort of a front Tony Stark chest light.
B003EOXEBQ|3|The fit is a little off
B00AG39DL8|5|Replaced the passenger side reflector on my 2009 328 xi.
B00CLMBE5A|5|I'm a 49 year old Woman and installed this myself.  Easily done removing muffler, fire wall, installing and replacing parts after installation.  The hole in my car for the bolts to fit through was too small so i bored it out some to open the hole.  The most difficult part for me was making holes in the firewall to allow for the new bolts. Find instructions on-line  Make sure you have a torque wrench!
B00BD4SKXG|2|THEY DID NOT FIT OUR EXPEDITION Size seats, wish it would have because they were sooo light and seem to be easy to take care of
B000S2SSYK|2|Had some of the wires arking in the middle of the wire when I had hood open in the dark end up having to change two of them with old ones
B007USCM7E|5|Works great!
B00AOK8MHO|5|I love the sound it makes. I have a 2011 wrangler unlimited Rubicon and it makes it sound so much better without a crazy amount of sound. When it is first installed, it is pretty loud but it will quiet down after about 1000-2000 miles, and it is really only loud when you want it to, and pretty quiet on the highway inside of the car.
B001DKTG0G|5|Great product. It's my 3rd time using it and I would use it again. I also recommend their max gear differential fluid
B00DEJUYBE|4|Looks like it came with the car hope it protects from bumper rash ...<br />BMW 2012 black 528ixdrive
B007R4H5QO|5|Fits well keeps head cool under helmet
B00P3XDL6E|5|awesome part!
B007RVTBF0|5|Great
B0002MABGE|5|Swore I would not let my terriers in my beautiful new Ford Edge..the seats are leather and the interior of the vechile is a rich chocolate brown..two strikes out for pet fur and sharp nails. This pet barrier provided a wonderful and efficent compromise..great price to have confined canines !
B0007LVJ20|5|Really good lock. Now I can trailer my bike to the lakes, and not worry about coming back just to find the bike trailer stolen by some filthy crooks.
B00IWO4K8O|1|Does not fit Jeep Wranglers.  Thinking it was a tight fit, had to force the head into the current receiver.  Won't come close to fitting the head of the seat belt now.  Having to pry this out of my seat belts.  NOT even close to universal.
B0068FUUQK|5|Outstanding very easy to use great product.
B005VUQC7Y|4|Quality piece but I found that the arm that lifts the door mechanism to open the door rubbed on the inside of the door skin.  So when I lifted the handle, I would hear a scratching sound. I loosened the mounting bolts and slid the handle all the way over to the front of the vehicle and tightened it back down and it still hit. So I had to remove the handle and bend the arm away from the door skin.<br /><br />Either way, It's a nice piece.
B00MB0F9DA|5|I love my new key ring bracelets! I always forgot my house key but now I have each of these colorful bracelets to attach it to so that I can easily wear it around my wrist. Good quality, fast shipping and they fit perfect around my tiny wrist! Lol love the colors too! :)
B007KCXNJ6|5|Worked as advertised, and came well packaged. Easy install for my '05 ESVv
B00AESZH0Q|5|Have purchased these before. Proud to show my branch of service.
B00EKBLYUU|5|RECEIVED THEM IN A FWE DAYS AND THEY ONLY TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR TO INSTALL.  THEY LOOK GREAT AND THE FRONT OF MY SUBURBAN LOOKS NEW.  NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE SAID PLASTIC WAS THIN.  I COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.
B000O54J62|5|Great item , bright, and as described.... had product for 3 months and ballist broke contacted company And replaced it fast....greatly appreciated
B00LPIKK38|5|Kept them at bay while I was away.  Put these on the windows while I was gone for a bit and didn't worry about break-ins as much.  Great neighborhood but you never know in hard times what desperate people will do.  This I believe thwarted any untoward thoughts.  :)
B001KOPFIW|1|Not the quality I was expecting nor needed. First use, shattered the large cutting pin while trying to remove the 520 old chain. Reverted to using an angle grinder to slice the chain in half....I probably should have done that from the beginning since the old chain was headed in the trash anyway and the angle grinder is much quicker and easier. All was well with riveting the new chain until the last bit of torque applied to stake the 2nd pin in place. There was a creak, a spark, and when I inspected it, the riveting pin was split down its length.<br /><br />I've used a number of shop-quality chain tools over the years, and know what a good one should do. But these days, I don't have ready access to buddies in shops who will let me borrow certain specialty tools that I only need once every few years, so I've been buying my own. This one came recommended, and I figured, despite it's chincy looks, Motion Pro makes some great tools, so this thing must be up to the task. Wrong.<br /><br />I'll be looking for something with a little more ass behind it.
B000E2CO9Y|5|Does what I expected. No complaints.
B00HSHW7R2|5|Bought this kit for my 2008 Nissan Altima. The lights are great quality, easy to install and at least 5x brighter than the stock halogen bulbs. They put off a nice Bright white light that is sure to turn heads.
B00E975M8A|3|Good
B00VM3YAJG|5|Great helmet... Fits very well...
B011B25IXY|5|I love these wash mitts. I washed my vehicles without near the effort of my old mitt- which is now off to history somewhere in landfill. Very comfortable and moved the dirt away easily, I like it a LOT and would not hesitate to buy again.
B000CMDCKQ|5|great product
B00BQS6UA4|5|the correct part for my car
B00IOLSPSQ|4|worked great the screws were a little corroded but I could work around them
B005NLQAHS|5|I've been using this scan tool with the Android Torque Pro app for about 6 months and it's continuing to be a great investment. I used it to diagnose a check engine light (dying upstream O2 sensor). After that, I used it to gauge completion of the emissions readiness monitors so I could go in for emissions testing.
B00KJGKZTQ|1|Had key cut but do not know how to program key.
B009AA2FAY|4|The part came relatively quick. It was easy to replace. The new sensor cleared the service airbag message. Thanks for the good service.
B00IX24ZH6|5|This is a great way to get a little lift under your Ram. It is called a leveling kit but I would label it more like a budget boost. It does bring the front up 2.5-3&#34; and the back around 1-1.5&#34;. This maintains a little bit of rake, which is what I wanted, but also gives better ground clearance all around and room for bigger tires if you choose. (I'm staying stock for now, factory 33s are decent size and look good)<br /><br />On the installation side, it was more of a pain than I expected considering my truck is a 2014. The drivers side strut was a real pain as the stud on the strut nut snapped off when I was trying to disassemble it. Ended up having to soak the nut in a lot of penetrating oil and continuously bump the nut with an impact gun and eventually it came off. (The strut spins without the 8mm stud to hold it still) New England road salt is to blame for the rust on the nut that made it so tough, pretty sad at 25k miles. Other than that I removed the brake calipers on the front to allow more downward movement of the knuckle, the brale line tightened right up when I dropped it initially...instructions don't mention that. Back end was very straight forward.<br /><br />In terms of 'specialty' tools to do the job you'll need spring compressors and an 18mm 'go-thru' socket and wrench to do the strut nut as the best option. It is possible to do it with an 18mm impact as well.<br /><br />Can't complain overall with the good price for what you get out of it! Ride still feels like factory!
B00OHBV4GW|5|I ordered this for my hubby to use with our lightbar that we recently purchased and it is great!  He said it was easy to instal, and great quality as well!! It looks really nice as well the way my husband mounted it inside our truck! I'm so happ we found this universal harness!<br />I recieved this universal harness at a discounted price in exchange for my 100% honest reviews and was not compensated at all for my positive reviews!
B00ZB84H0U|5|They work great
B000GU7I2C|1|second nelson ring cover I've purchased. once again after a yr, cover splits due to sun making cover weak. great cover if you park your bike indoors. can't seem to get a warranty even though they have 2 yr warranty because it was purchased through amazon?? nelson rigged...
B00480FIEG|5|If the main bulb is all that is blown out, then this is a much cheaper and great alternative to fixing your headlight.  Plugged these in without too much difficulty in my 2004 Honda Accord, and they've been much better than the OEMs.  Be careful to not get anything on the bulb before you plug it in (fingerprints especially, wear gloves), as the heat can build up on these can potentially kill your bulb.  This may be a tight squeeze to install for some models or if you have larger hands, but again even if you have them replaced at a shop, this will be much cheaper than replacing the whole headlight setup.<br /><br />The light is not overpowering/blinding like a lot of the newer bulbs are. It is a paler white color than the OEM for my car was, which I like.  Definitely enough lighting to guide you through most of your night driving needs
B000RI32LE|5|I tried to buy generic floor mats for my 2010 Honda element and was unable to find one that fit properly because of the little holder spikes in the floor. These fit perfectly, and were just fine for the car. delivery fast, would recommend as good seller and good mats. No complaints.
B00CTSFSA8|5|awesome tip looks great. gets the same job done as mbrp but much cheaper
B008JORKP2|2|We purchased this item as a staple to our RV.  We used it three times and it worked perfectly.  The fourth time we used, which was outside the 30 Day warranty, the flames were uncontrollable.  When lit the flames were very low, and would not increase.  As minutes passed the flames became intense on their own, and could not be turned down.  Today I learn that the warranty from Amazon is only 30 days.  If it was a little heavier I guess it would be a good boat anchor.  Please use great caution if you have one, but I would not recommend this as a purchase for anyone.<br />Do not purchase this product or any other from Heininger.
B00EA2VR5Q|4|Very nice a little light. Screws not included
B00LDWZAK4|5|love it!
B00BTLEJXI|4|Kinda tricky getting the installation right particularly with the straps. But once I figured it out it seemed to make I'm the fit much tighter. Not the best covers but for the money I think it's worth it. Just dont expect $200 cover results and you should be satisfied.
B011KHEHWS|5|I bought this due to needing a cloth to wipe the water off my car after a car wash.  It is compact and  does not take up space in my car.  As a result, I can easily leave it in the car for when I feel like getting my car washed.  On my first use, I was wowed by the level of water it picked up.  I even tried squeezing the water out to see how much it picked up, but the towel essentially sucked up the water and nothing came out.  The fabric is high quality and does not look like it will ever fall apart with use.  In addition to using it for wiping up water after a car wash, I could see using it for any liquid spills.  Overall, especially for the price, this is a great cloth that can be used for all those times when you just need to wipe up some liquid.
B000JFHMVQ|4|This is a great oil pan, the only negative that I have found is that because of the open design oil splashes everywhere when a filter is accidentally dropped.  I have only used closed pans before, but i like this one better and it is very well built.
B009JCDAIE|5|Still working!
B00NJAJ9R8|2|stickies are too small
B007PX68Q0|5|I mean it's a sticker, It's good.
B00II5YD4S|4|Very good water blade. Not as flexible as the 12&#34; one though.
B00HJ1592C|4|Getting lots of compliments.  Classy
B00YTZGSKI|1|Ordered this for my dodge ram, description says fits all from 98 thru 2014. Someone needs to figure this out because I ain't the only one that had this problem,  been multiple buyers. I'm going to send this back were it came from for a full refund including shipping.....
B009YFSO1O|5|Works well!
B000EBMKAS|3|Too big for the glovebox of my Jeep Compass but stores just fine above the passenger side visor. It does work it's way out and falls to the seat occasionally (the reason there are only 3 stars) but it holds everything I need it to.
B000GD5FMY|5|For the money they are great and do the job.
B00S7QR624|1|Didn't fix my problem on my 94 4 runner v6
B0013FFEQQ|5|Great buy!  Came in a AC Delco box and all bulbs work ( I tried each one just to check)
B00FM1CKK0|2|Very cute although it came broken.
B00OBOZVSC|5|Well made product. I will buy again.
B006L8I9VM|4|Fits perfectly and is excellent quality. My only gripe is I wish the lip around the perimeter was higher to catch any liquids that might spill.
B009J6AAGU|5|Great product for smokers who don't want anyone to know they smoke lol. Spray a few times after each cigarette and nobody would be the wiser. My only complaint is I can't seem to find it in any store where I live.
B00RK81ZBI|5|Great upgrade.
B00PKIBVU0|2|For nearly 10 years I used a Schumacher wheeled battery charger for charging and Deltran Battery Tenders for maintaining my vehicles. I have two vehicles, which are driven less than a dozen times a year and the NOCO Genius G15000 looked like an interesting option because of its ability to repair sulfated batteries. I also have Range Rover with a quiescent battery drain that's not practical to have a battery tender on. On the weekends I'll use the Schumacher to recharge the Range Rover battery. I thought the NOCO G15000 would also be a good upgrade because of it's ability to jump a vehicle and small enough that I could leave it in the Range Rover. The G15000 worked for three charges. It was slightly slower than my wheeled batter charger, but when you're charging it overnight, it really doesn't make a difference. This past weekend I hooked up the G15000 and left it charging overnight. The next morning the G15000 was at 50% and it was still pushing out a charge around 13V based on my voltmeter readings. I disconnected the G15000 from the battery and then connected my Schumacher charger to the Range Rover battery. Within 10 seconds, the Schumacher indicated the battery was fully charged. I then hooked G15000 to a fully charged marine battery. Within 5 minutes G15000 indicator went from 25% to 50%, but half an hour later the G15000 didn't advance past 50% even though the battery was fully charged the day before. So it would seem that my unit is defective and it can't complete a charging cycle after three uses. What is very troubling is that if I was using it as a maintenance tender and left it as-is for a number of days it could have overcharged and burned out my battery.
B0091MISA2|5|love this sticker~!!!!
B00H2W0ZCW|5|I blew out a rear brake line..yada...yada...Lots of research later, I realized I needed tools that may not be the cheapest, but would get it done.  This kit definitely made the task easy!<br /><br />I was able to replace my brake lines with confidence in the flares...<br /><br />The kit came with easy instructions to set the flares...the only disclaimer is that I practiced about five times before I made the &#34;real&#34; flares.  Anyway, they were all good....no leaks, and have been tested for about 5k miles without issue.  I look forward to being able to work with fuel lines in my TR6 next.
B00BZQRAME|3|Good splash guards but the one I received do not have the Ram head logo on them.  Just plain black.
B004MSJ7E6|5|If used properly they work great!  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!.  If people are buying these and have never sync'd carbs before and don't understand how to do it, DON&#34;T LEAVE A BAD REVIEW!  I've been tuning bikes for 30 years and used to use the good ol' mercury tubes, which work the best, but our brilliant government has forced their sale to stop.  The Pro-Motion syncpro mercury replacement model is garbage, don't waste your money.  I think these are the best you can do now-a-days.  I did have to recalibrate 1 of the gauges, but it took seconds.  Good stuff.  Fast shipping too!
B001FJW23S|3|I bought the ball joints in april 2014 for my 2006 Toyota Tacoma. At first it was nice, I expected it to work at least 2-3 years with no problem. Fast forward 1 year. I have to replace both ball joints now. I am disappointed.
B002P8D5E8|3|the one for my truck has 5 pins and this one has only 3.
B00KXE3QU4|5|Has held up well for the past 6 months no fading or pealing!
B00842A7F4|5|Well made, just like OEM
B00BAZCBVK|4|Overall, good service and these HID bulbs fit in my 2002 Acura TL base.  But I can't rate 5 stars for these bulbs yet as I am not sure how reliable they are.  I have experienced buying online different pairs of HID bulbs from different manufacturer for the same car and they did not last a year.  I will be glad to give a 5 stars if those can go over a year.
B000IY49AK|5|Husband says&#34;Pefect fit for a 2001 Nissan Altima GLE&#34;.
B00JA1CBIO|5|Fit great. Had the middle gasket blow out after 100 miles. Contacted Auto Dynasty and they refunded a more than fair portion of the purchase and pointed me to another vendor that had them in stock. I'm happy with their service!
B0009ZEVMY|5|This was very simple to replace in a 1999 E300 Mercedes.  Just make sure you get it down in the filter housing good before you try to replace the filter housing lid.  It fit perfectly.  It appears to be high quality.  It is flexible.  It's an air filter... without technical equipment to test it, there's not much for me to say about it.  I will know more after using it for 10-20 thousand miles.  Due to the ease of fit and price, I will likely purchase this same filter again next time it needs to be changed.
B00JZXA7XI|5|Good product. Great price
B00H6ETIWY|5|work great on my Honda pioneer 500
B008KV4GCO|5|perfect fit
B00INZ65B2|4|Good little package, could use a few more light bulbs
B000SPHRWQ|4|Fit my 93 bronco with quad suspension with 4&#34; left just fine
B002VVCJT6|5|Super add on for a HD Sportster 1200 Custom --easy swap for original speedo--
B0096BH86I|5|Perfect for my 2014 Honda Accord EX. Installed it in about 10 min once I figured out where everything goes but it didn't come with directions so I watched a youtube video for advise BUT here's how to and read everything first:<br />Get some rubbing alcohol and wipe down where the visor and plastic stickers will lay. To align the visor correctly and evenly I hooked all 4 clips on and lined up the visor. You can use masking tape to hold them in place. Place the washers over all your screws so they will be ready. Next, one at a time, lay the plastic stickys down first, without pressing it down on the under side, then hook the metal piece into place so the sticky smoothly lays down on the under side. Hook two into place first and line up the visor and place the screw on the outside of the visor and screw on the nut. Do the other two next. Keep the nuts loose because you still probably have to adjust the metal clips. Look at each one carefully to make sure they aren't crooked. Once its all lined up perfectly begin to tighten everything up but DO NOT tighten them too much. Hand tighten is fine if you're strong enough but my girly hands couldn't handle it so I used tools smartly. Make sure the metal clips are flush with car surface and also make sure the visor isn't bending at the top outside of its natural curve because that will let you know it is too tight. GOOD LUCK!
B00T4OJO2S|5|Love the hitch cover. The quality is really good. The only thing that would make it better is if the logo were in the red, white and blue Rangers colors.   EDIT:  Not great quality. The back is already rusted......
B004DRSQD4|5|They fit great &were easy to install
B000J41WYK|5|Finally.... a sunshade that fits perfectly and made well.
B001SGC45E|5|I ordered this along with an entire rear taillight for my 2002 Trailblazer.  When I got them, I was very surprised to see that the seller had already assembled them for me.  The taillight replacement literally took 2 minutes and worked and fit perfect.  Great product for a LOT less than GM wanted for it!
B00SGFZCTA|5|High quality materials and stylish design.  I bought this for my wife who often needs to separate her car and house key - this provides a quick and secure way to separate her keys and she loves it (and she is picky!)  The leather strap comes in multiple colors, so it could be coordinated with her handbag.
B000CINDQS|5|intake, compression, power and exhaust
B00UEABUKA|5|Love the helmet. It fits snug but is not uncomfortable to wear. The flip open face mask is definitely the way to go!!!
B00EL37R8U|5|love these things. the light is nice and natural like outdoors. not a big fan of the soft white color.
B00873J0YY|4|all good
B008JORKP2|5|Easy to set up. Puts off good heat. Love this fire pit.
B002MQDY4O|5|Fits perfectly.
B000C5FI14|5|simple clean replacement.
B009DK8ALE|5|Brand new motor, popped it right in...works like a charm!! A++
B0024E6QX0|5|Works great
B00332GCAO|5|Perfect fit and great quality
B005G7Y4Y0|5|Replaced one that got damaged
B000KC1WEG|5|The price was fantastic. I took the 5th wheel unit to my local shop for installation, and it went smoothly. Product came quickly and was exactly as expected!
B005C5A7A6|5|exact Yamaha part at a good price
B000GVD7OE|5|Well pleased.
B0012PDTS2|4|Exactly as described
B013ME9PII|5|I was pretty excited to get this after reading some information on why my husband should not hang his helmet on the handle bars and such. He added this to his motorcycle over the weekend it was very easy to add to his bike. It holds the weight of his helmet and the hook has a great grasp of the helmet keeping it from falling on the ground. You don't notice that it is even there so it does not take away from the look of his bike. Disclaimer I did get this product at a discount for my honest review.
B00D918I74|5|Great trailer hitch!  Love the quality and price.
B002916XMC|3|This gauge is ok, but not great. It has a hollow, cheap feel in your hand, like it’s made of thin plastic. I don’t think it would survive much of a fall, if it was dropped.  It has to be turned on to operate, which is fine, but it times out too quickly. I kept having to turn it back on when I moved to the next tire to check – even when I was just moving just a few feet to the next tire on the same side of the car.
B0033XXXG4|5|Absolutely first class product. I had very little problem installing the new legs. After reading reviews I was worried it would be difficult, Mine went in effortlessly, it took me more time wiring the new switches than installing the new legs. The independent control is a great improvement over the single motor running both legs. My only suggestion would be for them to include a plate to mount the switches to. I had to stop in the middle and go buy a mounting plate I used a plastic &#34;no smoking&#34; sign form my local hardware shop turned over to the solid white side.What an overall improvement to my fifth wheel.
B000IYTV12|5|just as expected
B0024DYM3M|1|was not the material I thought and it is a tripping hazzard.  It will not lay flat.
B005KDOA9Y|5|KNOCK ON WOOD, these puppies have lasted me 2.5 years. They are a clean, sharp white appearance, and go beautifully with my yellow fog lights.
B000NOO798|1|worked for a short period of time.  I completed the process exactly as stated on the bottle and I does work for some people, in my case on a 2002 Jeep Liberty it reduced the leaking head gasket, but I still get miss fires and coolant smell.
B00YXCFSSK|5|The Only Orange Cone Filter Cover,perfect fit great quality! I wanted something Different than the regular RED or Blue. The pictures don't do it justice.It looks good.
B00784WI60|3|First off it didn't fit exactly back into the factory holes like the original , I had to modify it to fit , it was also bowed from top to bottom , if you look at the picture of the part in this review ad it nice and square top to bottom , left to right everything is nice and square not so with the part you sent me it looked like a swaybacked horse the way it was bowed ! but its in and seems to work ok although I believe the original worked better and got colder
B000CB0KJ8|5|The product is installed and works fine
B005FI5BBA|5|Good quality.
B006ZSUR5O|5|Perfect fit, works better than the exploded OEM part it replaced.
B000CFS0TG|5|Head studs worked great for Canfield aluminum heads.
B0067O7VQO|3|I wish there was a 2.5 star option.....product came to my house early...which I liked. Go out to put them in, the first one lights up and Im happy, go around back for the cargo bay....the other bulb doesnt light up, tried playing with it, making sure the connections were good. So i took it out switched them and again the one LED did not work.....Not really happy I have one bright white led...and a yellow regular bulb....kinda bulls***.
B00S0JOEH8|1|It was the right part just missing a big detail.  That it is cut in half and that you have to go to a dealer to get it put together.
B00NTOJU28|5|I place one on the trunk area of my mini van and work perfect. Has a great power of light.
B000C9QU5I|5|Fit perfectly and saved me a bundle!!

B005032988|5|Super fast shipping and looks great!
B000IYR76S|1|Part did not fit my car after I matched it completely and I had to pay to ship it back just as well as I had to pay to have it shipped to me
B00TYXZU5Y|5|Always a reliable first class product. This time made better with Amazon Prime shipping!
B00192JGA8|5|Just another &#34;cover all the bases&#34; thing for my camper.
B00EKEGRVS|1|One broke after a month... its very cheaply made. Do not buy.
B00XK410TS|5|Worked perfect on my 2000 BMW 328i so far we shall see if it lasts
B00OGSL2J0|4|Works well
B000C93F3I|3|Although the muffler and pipe assembly are well made, the pipe bends are in the right places and angles, and the muffler hangers are in the right positions, the pipe mating style isn't even close to the stock part.  The Honda parts use a ball-and-cup style mating between the muffler assembly and the pipe forward of the muffler assembly.  It uses spring reliefs on the mounting bolts to allow some minimal rotational play between these two pipe sections.  The Walker unit is designed for a more conventional compression seal with a flat gasket between two flanges.  Fortunately, the flange on the Walker unit was thick enough that I was able to use a die grinder to flare out the flange opening enough to fit over the ball shaped end of the original forward pipe section.  However, there was not enough flange material to open it up enough to use the stock mounting bolts with spring reliefs.  I was able to make it work but Walker should have made their part a direct match to the stock part, especially since they claim it to be a direct fit.
B00CPL8UPY|5|the best
B00O72R7Z8|5|Bought this wiring harness as it was one of the most popular purchases by people who bought the LED's I got. Mounted the LED's to my bumper and wired everything up to a switch in the cab, and the harness appears to work perfectly. Will update if I experience any of the melting issues that other people have mentioned, but I'm just running a pair of LED's on my bumper, not a light bar, so I think I'm in the safe zone.
B004BTOP3E|5|So far,  so good.  Push down brake pedal to get it to install, then release and it works like a charm.
B00G3L1GQC|3|Product required some fabrication .
B007NNKA9I|5|works great been in my car for 6 months now with no issues
B000C1LW0E|5|works great
B00DFUNSII|3|The bulbs included are bad quality. I recommend to get a new set of bulbs.
B0009IQW78|5|It seems to be as good as the Honda filters that I've used in the past.
B002UC6OYC|5|The original nozzle broke,and the replacement hose and spray are fine.<br />In very cramped quarters,2008 Southwind 32VS, we removed the original hose<br />and in about five minutes we were back in business!!
B00CZEZNGU|5|I bought this for a friend's kitchen sink light in his RV and he is very happy with it. He says he likes how bright it is and the fact that it is an energy saving led type. Thanks for a great product.
B00SZHK578|5|It is perfect that's  what  I espected
B002UC8LZW|5|As advertised,  new in box.
B00PE2BH3S|5|Good quality, Great price, Fast shipping.
B000CGDDD8|4|good product, but expensive.
B00BYH6C1E|4|These work great; however, they did not fit in my 2007 Ford Explorer. They just couldn't squeeze between the seat and the center console. I would recommend making sure there's at lease enough room to put your hand in-between. I thought it could squeeze past the tight spot, and sit just below where the seat is widest so that it can catch anything that slips down there.<br />I gave this to a friend who has a 2003 Lexus ls300 and it worked great for them.
B004VGAJOG|5|Good product
B000WJGLKC|2|Part needs wiring scheme and better quality parts.
B00FOOPNJU|4|Great replacement if my door handle was chrome but mine is more of a brushed silver/grey so beware when ordering this is chrome
B00A8QBX5C|5|An excellent choice as opposed to paying Harley over $300 dollars for the same pump.
B0041E26D0|4|I'm sure you could find it for a better price but I love the convenience
B000FOIJXQ|1|I should have listened to the other reviewers.  This product is awful!  I was unable to get rid of the streaks when applying the product to the door trims of my car.  I applied a series of thin layers as advised by some reviewers, but no luck.  The product also started peeling after the first car wash!  Horrible product.  :(
B0022YNBTE|5|I purchased this bag because all of my friends like to ride up into the mountains for the weekend in the fall.  I haven't gone on that trip yet but I did go motorcycle camping last weekend and I was amazed at all the camping gear that this quality bag was able to hold.  It rained on us while we were making the ride home so I pulled out the rain cover and tightened it up to the pack and it worked perfectly to keep the luggage and all my gear dry. Highly recommend.
B00O5LWSI2|4|Came right on time as expected. It looks good on the front of my 1965 Rambler.
B005C57JQ6|5|did what it's supposed to

B004Y01WAY|5|along with new egr valve this positioner did the job.
B000GTWGHA|5|Does a great job well made.
B005F9HU54|5|works
B00HZTDKZG|5|They work well.
B001CF4UXU|5|Love this strap, I get so excited when I have to use it. Its beefy, well made webbing. I have no concerns with it breaking when towing or recovering anything. Pulled full sized Chevys (with my Ford!), Jeeps, ATVs, used it as a tree saver. I just always make sure I put it away clean and dry, and keep it out of the sun when not in use. Should last for many years.
B00F5MUB66|3|All those who rave about how fantastic this is must have really bad performing RV shower heads to begin with.  The one that came in my old RV (1988 model) works almost as well, and includes a built-in shutoff valve. But with all the great reviews, I thought I'd give this a try.  So, here are my impressions of it: It works better than our old factory shower head, but certainly isn't &#34;jet-power&#34;.  The flow pattern is OK although a bit smaller, the valve almost completely shuts the flow down (nice), and it gives a slightly better &#34;feel&#34; than our old stock head.  The hose is extremely stiff; in fact I ended up using my old hose instead.  However my daughter dropped the unit once in the shower and the threaded end broke off the valve section.  We've dropped our stock shower head numerous times without issue, so I'm disappointed in the quality of that piece, and now must look for a replacement.  Bottom line is that it works a bit better than my stock RV shower head, but the threaded fitting on the shut-off valve is easily broken.  Not worth the money, IMO.
B00T6IXPXG|5|looks good and protects the fender
B0012DKFEK|5|It fit perfectly.  I handled it very carefully at first but found it could be folded or rolled very easily.  Keeps van cool.  Would recommend.
B0006IX7YC|4|AS ADVERTISED.GOOD PRODUCT
B00842A7F4|5|These little critters are excellent! They saved me SO MUCH TIME instead of having to try and re-use the old ones. I will have to remove the splash panels again to replace the condenser fan when the rest of the order arrives.
B00AQIDXVO|4|Exactly what was advertised.  Would get 5 stars, but how much can you love a sun visor?
B00CTVN3DY|5|This was a gift for my sister who loves the Minions. She was very, very excited. The only draw back is that the item is not quite large enough to fit the windshield of the minivan. Still laying over the dashboard and steering wheel helps with heat and fading.
B00CFCI3D2|5|Bought these for my husbands 2010 Ford Fusion and they look great. They replaces the manufacturers mats and look better the the originals. I would definitely recommend them.
B002LEEXAQ|1|Like others have stated, most of the blue lettering has fallen out....and it now looks terrible.  Don't waste your money!
B000HBM45Q|3|Not very thick gloves. They work ok.
B008ZE8VRC|4|I have had several K&N systems over the years and they are just awesome. it makes the vehicle sound tough and healthy

B004QQ721Y|5|Exactly what my car needed.
B00ERIA8XU|5|The seller was efficient and extremely friendly, and the product was of very good quality! Would definitely buy again.
B005R6R6DG|5|Much easier to use than the liquid version.
B00JJ68AVW|1|Ripped after less than normal use and approx. 2 months, very cheaply made, tried to contact dealer they never contacted me back.
B00YIMU902|5|Correct fit and respond like original equipment
B0002KKTFO|5|Far better than the $15 dollar piece of junk I bought at the orange home improvement store. Should have bought this one from the start...
B00GHT9G6W|5|Fit perfect took about 10 minutes to install
B00O7JDZ7U|1|Welded shut on me, had to pull the battery to get my starter to stop cranking. Would not recommend.
B003CWBCZ0|3|Good fit, SL500 (2003), but lasted less than 12 months in Florida's sunshine: (1) stitchings around the mirrors tore; (2) cover started disintegrating (leaving white dust from the inside of the cover on the car every time it was unwrapped for a drive); and (3) any tug (e.g. around the antenna) tore the cover at the point of pressure. Ordering a replacement now, will try another brand.
B0015PN010|5|GOOD TOOLS
B00DGPEK98|5|Fit perfectly -- easy to install!!!
B00RER6O2U|4|exactly what i was hoping for
B00HD9SQUW|5|Just what the doctor ordered.  Works and looks great!
B00U46XXPE|5|I sweat a lot, so when I play soccer or work out, I hate getting in my car and getting sweat all over my leather seat. I did a lot a research, and this seat cover is the best I've seen--it's easy to put on, since it slips over the headrest, and because it goes on that way it also protects your entire seat and headrest from the sweat and dirt on your body. On top of that, it's also $10 - $12 cheaper than the competitors. Glad I found it!
B00PYFVSQ6|4|Real nice.
B00PSRORH2|4|I just used them on a road trip three days in the car. My kids used them in the back window of my Dodge Dart and they were great size and clung to the windows perfectly. They use them the whole time the sun was on them in the back seats. They also kept the car cool in the back when we stopped and the car was off. Great product
B004ZF35GM|5|Perfect
B0042OX8YA|4|Inexpensive and works.  The mounting plate is positioned differently than the factory place<br />so I had to remove this unit from its mounting plate and use the original. Not a big deal. But not a direct fit either<br /><br />1996 k1500
B00KWMCITC|5|Very good quality

B005HU60DE|5|Great product
B006FXGYY2|2|I was so excited when these arrived. To my disappointment, these did not fit my r56 fog lights well, at all. There were multiple creases that would not smooth out, even with some extra heat application. Light looked very nice coming through the vinyl, but the creases were aesthetically un-appealing.
B00SJTKZ3Q|5|Have put about a 1000 miles on it so far on my cb300F.. all i can say is DAMN!! great sounding exhaust, its super loud, nice deep roar as im tearing up the gears! great slip on exhaust, super easy to install and makes riding so much funner and it makes me feel safer to actually see drivers turn and look for me because they can hear me coming.
B005K2286M|3|Wind sounds (-)<br />Poor Adhesive  (-)
B001UEJK8S|3|It worked fine for about 6 months and then started acting up.  The switch send 2 signals, one for the brake light and the other to the cruise control.  The cruise part is what is problematic for me as it works only intermittently now and I have to tap on the brakes to get the switch to unstick or whatever it's doing internally.  This time I ordered the original OEM switch.
B0015DLNFM|1|The filter wrench did not fit my daughters 2011 Subaru legacy I should have bought it at dealership where I could of made sure it was the right one

B00QJRYMFC|2|I read all the reviews for this item and both the praises and criticisms are both warranted.<br /><br />I have a 2003 Toyota Sienna, and I wanted a compact, Bluetooth (not Wifi) OBD2 reader to diagnose why my &#34;Check Engine&#34; light was on, and to use it with my iPhone (not Android or Windows).  There are a bazillion Wifi devices available for iPhone, and a bazillion Bluetooth devices for Android or PC, but this is the ONLY one that I found (August 2015) that was Bluetooth for iPhone.  I paid $35 for this LELink scanner product, and another $5.99 for the required EngineLink iPhone App (purchased on the App Store).  I don't know if other apps will work.  Similar devices for Android phones are available for $12 or so, and use free Apps.  So I paid a total of $41 vs. $12 if I had an Android phone.  Ok - not a big deal considering how much I paid for my iPhone 6+ and my car, and how much a car repair is going to cost (depending on the trouble).  Still, it indicates that this product is overpriced.<br /><br />The LELink device arrived overnight (kudos Amazon Prime).  There were ABSOLUTELY NO INSTRUCTIONS - nada, nothing.  The only way I had a clue what to do is curtousy the reviews available here on Amazon (kudos to Amazon's customers!).  The LELink device does provide one clue.  One the side, printed in very hard to read lettering, is a website:  www.outdoor-apps.com.  If you go there, it tells you to use an app called EngineLink that is available for purchase there, or several other sites.  Curiously, they don't mention the Apple app store - but that is where I bought it.<br /><br />EngineLink loaded perfectly smoothly on my iPhone 6+ (iOS 8).  But the steps for using it are totally obscure.  I am an Electrical Engineer with a Masters Degree and lots of experience in software and hardware devices - and were it not for my obstinancy, I could easily have given up and thrown this device away as useless.  With the clues provided in these reviews, I was able to plug in the OBD2 connector to my Toyota Sienna (under the steering wheel well and toward the right a bit, above the accelorator pedal).  A red glowing LED came on, even though I had no key in my vehicle.  Nice to know that the device made a connection.  And I believe that the LED will not drain my car battery even if I leave the device plugged in for a very long time.  Afterwards, I was easily able to connect the EngineLink app to the OBD2 device (LELink) via Bluetooth.  Curiously, the app shows two connection options: WiFi and LELink.  Why it doesn't say Wifi and Bluetooth, instead of LELink - I don't know!  The Wifi option does not work with this product - but EngineLink can connect to other products.<br /><br />At that point, it is not clear whether you need to have a key in the ignition switch and/or have the engine on, or not.  I tried every possible combination of things.  In some of them, I received a warning message about my car not supporting certain functions (Fuel/Vacuum) for the gauge displays.  No matter - I proceeded anyway, and in fact, with the car engine running, I sometimes I was able to see the RPM meter show a reading, but many times I was not.  I still don't know why it worked sometimes and not others.  Frustrating!<br /><br />Now, for reading my Check Engine Light trouble code, there is a separate display screen.  To get to the different display/screens, you swipe right or left.  Swiping right 4 times gets you to the screen where you can read trouble codes.  I was immediately able to read a trouble code (0442).  EngineLink correctly said it is &#34;emissions related,&#34; but you really have to go to some other automobile website like: http://engine-codes.com/p0442_toyota.html to read the full details, and read about options for how to correct the trouble.<br /><br />Also, I tried a bazillion times to CLEAR the trouble code.  Eventually I hit upon the right combination of steps, even though I thought I was following the instructions that EngineLink provided me, which were: &#34;Have key in car and on, but engine off&#34; or similar words to that effect.  I still don't know why it finally cleared the code when it did - instead of all the other times that it did not - but it did.  And so now I am somewhat happier.  Still frustrated with the difficulty of using this, but happier.<br /><br />For this product review, I would have given ONLY 1 STAR if I were not able to ultimately clear my Check Engine Light, but it did.  The process to get there, however, is much too painful and obscure.  Thus, two stars.  With some documentation and guidance, however, even if it were on the company's website, this product could potentially earn 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />I hope that all this info helps someone out there.  Thanks to the other Amazon reviewers before me!ne off&#34; or similar words to that effect.

B00DILSQO0|5|My old breast cancer wore out, so I ordered the Tinkerbell one.  It is so cute, and I get lots of compliments on it.
B005STB83Q|4|Quality is at least as good or better than OEM. However, I apparently ordered BLACK when CHARCOAL would have been the correct color....my mistake; TAKE CARE WHEN ORDERING YOURS. Fit is PERFECT on the driver's side, a little narrow on the passenger's side.<br /><br />I'm past the Amazon Return date so these are sitting unused in my garage. I will need to replace them with the CHARCOAL color.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005STB83Q Coverking Front Custom Fit Floor Mats for Select Audi A6 Models - 40 Oz Carpet (Black)]]
B004RCXCXY|4|Works as advertised.  Would buy it again.
B00AMMCCWK|4|Great... Looks good in my car...
B007EXNB2U|5|Perfect match for my Forest River Rockwood travel trailer.
B00KTHU1QM|5|These were simple to program for my 02 Altima, and work great.
B00VJ93IQ4|5|Good product got it sooner than expected
B000RN4FK6|5|nice throw over bags, they fit my V-rod well and the quality seems to be pretty good, for the price you can't beat them.
B0040CW2A0|4|Mine did not come with metal clips, but they got the job done. Cheap enough so I can just get some more of any pop off!
B005OOAAEI|4|They are pretty good and working. The lights do not matches with the interior of my car but that has nothing to do with the product. Even then, the LED lights gives a far better look to my Car's interior rather than the default bulbs.
B004K6J66E|5|bought this for my 2001 ford ranger edge. fit perfectly. its half the price of any parts store around here.
B001MP2V9K|5|This could not have been any easier or any simpler. After an unfortunate ding in a parking lot, my like-new truck was left with a broken taillight. I was skeptical of the quality or appearance of this because of the price and I've always had any scuffs or bodywork dealt with at a professional bodyshop. If you have a Toyota Tundra: There are only 2 retaining bolts holding the taillights in place. They're right there in front of you when you put the tailgate down. #30 Torx head and they screw right out and the taillight comes right out. Too easy.<br /><br />I was also blown away that this taillight assembly comes complete with bulbs and brand new harness. It's literally a complete plug-and-play swap out. And I cannot tell any difference between this taillight and the OEM. Very happy, especially for the price.
B0000CBIK5|4|good for my bike
B0052FRF06|3|Installation had to be creative to make the part fit, perhaps because mine is an XLE, so now am having an awkward time getting into my car, but it works fine. The price, the service, they're great.
B00CST9BC4|5|Perfect, and arrived early.
B003VDX5D2|5|I love this ladder - makes access to my truck bed easy now and later if a time comes when I am not as agile.

B000XLXWQ0|5|everything is now where I can get it without looking all over the floor in the back seat
B001C4OB8U|5|Easy to install, easy to clean and reuse. Excellent product at a greatly reduced price relative to local auto parts outlets.
B003JBLFBA|5|Fits just as expected and stays in place.
B00F55DLTW|5|A little smaller than I imagined but exactly as described.  EXCELLENT quality.  Size issue is mine not the seller's.
B009AA2FAY|5|worked fine
B0040D2TGG|1|the receiving pieces were poorly made and bound so you could not push the button through.  When you try to separate them, they are super brittle and crack, rendering them useless.
B009DJSFBA|5|It fit and worked even arrived earlier than expected
B001KVW6EQ|5|It is exactly like the extender they'd give you on board (picture the belt they use during demonstration). With that in mind, it came with a thoughtful little business card that identifies it as a personal item, not owned by the airline. Not that I imagine a flight attendant would ever notice and ask you for the belt, but still. Also came with a thin velvet carry bag that keeps it neatly wrapped and unobtrusive. Glad I bought it!
B008H5UAY6|5|Outstanding, fits great
B004QVA7W0|5|Great
B0022XHHHC|4|I had to get acid locally in order to use it. Maybe next time buy a gel-based ready to charge battery?

B004CN0BSC|5|Excellent color match for the factory bulb in a 2012 LS460. So good in fact, that I only replaced the burnt out one, although I did buy a pair. I will keep it in reserve.
B008BWJ3CA|5|Great
B001DIECCK|5|As advertised.Safety seal is the original and the best!
B007VHBGIU|5|Love it and very easy to install, will fit a 2007 F-150 no problems
B002TW1AZQ|1|Cheap, fell apart after a couple of weeks
B00GOQY8PM|5|good product
B001G59NOM|5|This cover fits my 2011 Fat Boy lo with windshield and luggage very nicely. Seems very durable too!! Thanks!! :-)
B00P9EJGR0|5|Nice coverage of seat - love the clips instead of Velcro for the attachment. adjusts well.
B00429NKWK|4|I think this is a good kit and the results are very good.  I recently bought a 2002 used vehicle and it is really nice with only 65,000 miles on the clock.  It is a very nice 20-footer.  The most obvious flaw was the headlight lens.  As you would expect, they were in really bad shape, which I knew at the time of purchase.  I looked at all the available kits for restoring these headlight lens and this one was the most reasonable when all the reviews were considered.  I checked other sites, too, and this one seemed to be highly rated on all of them.  So I bought this one.  What appealed to me was the amount of labor required and the process of the sand paper and the reasonableness of the system.  It worked just as advertised and the available video from Amazon.com, Sylvania and on YouTube show just how low tech but high result this process is.  One word of caution about applying the final UV coating.  When they say &#34;immediate&#34; touch up is necessary, that means &#34;RIGHT NOW&#34;, not in more than a few seconds.  My lens are clear but I have a flaw on the passenger side lens because I did not see a tiny spot I missed and it smeared some when I did so a couple of minutes later.  It is still crystal clear, just smeared in a small spot.  My wife does not notice it but I do.
B00029JMXA|5|Fun to have on the truck. Generates conversation about my hitch and love for boating. And haven't had to remove it when going through automated car washes. I could not guarantee that's true for all washes.
B0093A9YXW|5|The sun shade works great on my 2013 Prius V.
B000CMJ24G|1|Bolts are too short to pull steering wheel on 1988 GMC pickup.  Need at least 2 1/2 inches and they were only 2&#34;.  Waste of money
B00GZITV92|5|I love the kensun HID lights. They are the only brand of HID headlights I trust in all of my vehicles
B00JGE2PUE|5|Great product, fast shipping!
B0002LBGX2|5|Been using this wax on my Benz for three + years now,...nothing better.  Very easy application and removal,..<br />Makes heads turn everywhere!
B00H6XPZN6|5|light weighted, and attach to window easily
B0084OPJBO|5|Look and feel great.
B00BULD5D2|5|Exactly what I needed for our scooter.<br />Easy install, product was as advertised.<br />I would recommend to others.
B009IFIB0Y|5|Fit my truck perfectly heat mirror works better than the original one
B007A56LAG|5|Fast easy instaltion... Slightly faster turbo spoils, but let's face it, all about making the engine compartment eye appealing. This + coolant filter system will have you satisfied.
B00O7FPEV4|3|Nice headers came early in good shape doesn't fit my 97 civic lx put them on anyways with a lil force doughnut to big to fit on stock exhaust got a smaller one from auto zone need a s shape pipe and it would fit perfect sounds good tho
B005H12QXG|5|Great product and price.  Have used for over a year. The chev dealership wanted over a thousand dollars for this set of mirrors.
B009MC124K|1|It broke 3 days in...
B00NDN4ZE8|5|Love them ! Very durable
B007JYYPO2|5|rolls well
B0041QZQP8|5|Fit great and it does what its made for.
B003C508XO|4|Hella was always a quality product, still is
B000OE23U2|5|I recently restored a 1995 dodge 2500 . The dashboard was all cracked and brittle . This dash cap was hands down the best answer . If I remember correctly the company claimed it installed in 15 min and that is pretty accurate after you prep the old dash, the color (gray) matched pretty close considering the rest of the interior had 20 years of sun on it . great product
B002PQQ81M|5|great quality, I am satisfied
B00CHEWY7Y|5|These mats look like they came with my new car. I love them easy to clean covers the floor area completely
B00F34DLFE|5|Great piece of art
B00W2XG5UW|5|great fit
B004Q8L894|4|worked good
B000P7O5DG|4|Perfect length!  I use this with my heated seat cushion and can use in office or car.  Would recommend this convenient adapter.
B00Y9J5P6M|5|item looks great on vehicle - top piece came broken in center but I made it work
B00B3UZBZ0|5|excellent product
B004IARLL4|4|good quality much tougher than than the omix ones that only lasted a week.
B003S1RQ2S|1|It wasn't what I thought it would be very disappointed
B00A14H3TG|5|This has a plastic handle,not very big,but does the job 100%.very happy ! ! !
B00JUWPI5G|4|Works great! Only issue is there is a small amount of extra travel in the horizontal position that allows my phone to move or bounce. Really only an issue when using the navigation.
B00D3R0KVQ|1|better than the omix but still junky
B000N9OVHG|5|Easy installation, great peace of mind while boat is out of water and unattended.
B000F5LJ7S|5|Lock tool worked perfect. Well worth the extra money.
B001EP0GS6|5|It was easy to install and great deal
B00BDEP9S0|4|I have used mine a couple of times now and though it seems a bit flimsy it gets the job done and has performed above expectations. Good bang for the buck as far as I can see.
B001449I5E|5|As advertised.  Installed easily following instructions.
B000CSGT64|1|An otherwise great filter head nearly ruined by horrible machining on the threaded nipple that holds the filter to the filter head. Like another reviewer, I bought this to use with a Cat 1R-0750 filter, which has aluminum threads. The machining on this nipple is so bad and the threads so galled that it removes aluminum from the Cat filter, dumping those aluminum filings right into the clean side of the filter!<br /><br />I'll be returning this. I will not use and can't recommend a filter head that dumps contaminates right into the clean fuel stream.
B002HBU1FY|5|This is a good peoduct
B011DFTJTI|5|It's comes assembled and yes it's fast
B00B9IVRCW|4|Completely satisfied so far
B0009NWQWI|5|We used this on the back of our 2013 Dodge Caravan. Our van doesn't have luggage racks, so finding a suitable storage system was a challenge. The Rightline Gear Saddlebag was perfect for our trip. We went to Yellowstone from Seattle and drove over 2000 miles without any issue. We used the clips (sold seperately) to attatch it to the backdoor.
B0095EH3SY|3|It looks exactly like the OE part, but feels different.  The spring also doesn't seem to be as strong.  Attachment would be much better using the original nuts and screws.
B00DM8NE6Y|5|The decal was the exact size. It fit perfectly to cover the gold in the emblem. I accidentally ordered the wrong color so I contacted the seller. I received a response within an hour and by the next morning MY mess up was corrected.
B00CNEQYF6|5|Easy to install,  had it done in 5 minutes  (check YouTube for how to videos) cheaper than original equipment parts.
B00BXLTN4E|5|Quality. It looks cheap in the picture, but it seems well built.
B000GZPH2U|5|I can now ride without carpal pain!
B005N6Z56K|4|I did not realize the word a hole was printed on the back. I will bleep it out.
B000CSRA12|5|Fits perfectly! Happy with the quality and price!
B00ZUR5JEK|5|I just tried this out.  It works well.  Very easy to use.  I had other digital gauges and this one is great.  Sturdy construction and easily value seal.  I also ordered the JACO Superior Elite Tire Pressure Gauge.  Will compare them and then report
B00P2HRGPI|5|Love these items. Looks great  on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler. Didn't take but about an hour to mount.
B00B51XCQC|5|This was great. paint matched exactly and was very easy to install.
B00YMETDLW|2|I wrote a good review off this product, it was the first time I used it.  Now, today I need it again, but it was a pain to get this to show some paint.  I pressed and pressed but it was almost dry.  Point looses its shape, and was a disaster.  Too bad.
B00OBWMEIY|5|As described!
B000KORDOM|3|Good gloves.  They might even be used for welding gloves in a pinch.
B001GJ3DZS|5|Makes cleaning the wheels very easy.
B000C7YCVE|1|They did not fit the jeep that it said it would.
B00QMGQAXM|5|Fixed the throttle body codes that kept coming on and was causing reduced power with the 2004 ford explorer.
B0073WEZU4|5|Great item
B00YB3WFLE|5|Easy install and clean look..!!
B009FNWL9G|3|Fit perfectly on my 2013 Ram 1500 Express Quad Cab - Shipping was ok, box arrived a little beat up and my driver's side runner had a minor dent in it. Bag of bolts was open and found bolts, nuts, and washers inside the inner-box. 10mm x 35mm bolt was missing, had to buy at a local hardware store. In general, looks great on my truck.Just wish driver's side wasn't dented.
B0028OSCS8|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B000BOALF4|5|Thanks!
B00QH44ET6|5|Really good
B00192JF9U|5|Took a little finagling to get it clipped on, but it fits snuggly, so should work really well. Happy with it.
B0028JNRKQ|4|Make sure you check carmate dot com and check their size chart for the type of car you drive. This is a large. They also come in medium and small, and the fit all depends on the car you drive.<br />Pros:<br />1. Great quality<br />2. Looks awesome!<br />3. Good instructions in English and Japanese<br />4. The matching foot rest is sold separately if you want the full set on display.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. According to the website, this is supposed to fit Corolla 2009 and up but the break pedal is quite large. The kit comes with metal straps that wrap around your existing pedals and it was a tad bit wide but I still managed to get the strap around my break pedal. I gave it a solid squeeze so it's nice and tight, but I hope it holds. The acceleration pedal fit perfectly.<br />2. Installation is not easy, but not hard either. I would rate that a 3 out of 5. Once you get one pedal done, you've pretty much got the hang of it. I'm a woman in her thirties who knows nothing about cars and I got the job done.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />1. I almost studied the instructions before I began installing them. They have a lot of important warnings. Keep in mind, these are your stop and acceleration pedals that you're working on. Read ALL the instructions.<br />2. Fasten the metal straps as tight as you can.<br /><br />The only thing I worry about is the efficiency and longevity. I hope they stay in place and last a long time. They definitely augment the look of your car's interior.
B00KJGPQE0|5|Super fast shipping.<br />Sena products are all top quality.
B000X5JE6S|5|really great deal!!
B006U9T2EA|5|the product I got in the mail is a little different than what is pictured, but they still fit. I love these lights! Whenever someone gets into my JKU it is the first thing they notice. They are extremely bright and it looks a lot better than the yellow stock ones!
B000CITK8S|4|OK
B00KZD8HNE|5|Outstanding change to my q-5
B000K1YPLO|5|product as expected. Service and shipping AWESOME. Buy from them, you'll love the experience.
B008BDAP44|5|great fit for my 1981 honda cm400
B007HRJILG|5|Replaced my current lock since I had lost the key. Love the chrome!
B00URHME3W|1|Didn't even fit
B002R0L3M0|4|Worked perfectly!
B0021YZER2|5|I used this product in my showers, I had mild water spots but heavy soap scum. The product work amazing! I was afraid of scratching so I used a microfiber cloth, no scratches. I hate the up keep of shower glass, I'm so excited to have brand new glass again!
B00FH8P1DG|5|I think I bought this because it was the lowest price I'd ever seen on a large LED light bar. It came well protected in the box and included mounts for a flat roof, bumper, or hood mount. You will probably want to find the correct mount for your vehicle so that it will look right. I finally located some reasonable upper windshield mounts for my Wrangler TJ, though the mounts actually cost more than this light bar. I would suggest a wiring harness kit you can also find on Amazon like this-(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WMR1I64?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28) , which is the one that I used. The light is well constructed, ungodly bright, and a good investment compared to the crazy $1000 prices I've seen for the big brand named lights. And if some goober head steals it-you wont be crying the blues. I replaced the mounting screws with some tamper proof torx screws that might slow the thieves down a bit. I'll add to this post if I experience a problem with the light bar, but I don't expect any.
B00HV0MZNC|5|great
B00LSSW4TI|4|Wish it was darker but nice product
B003K20JXI|2|base is large
B00RBTTOJQ|3|there cool looking and good light wight gloves good for the summer but they don't have that much madding on the hands
B000B8N3BE|3|if you have a '98 ranger, check the threads.<br /><br />if the cap is threaded, this is your cap.<br />if the cap has those funny nubs instead of threads, you might want to look at a '99 model year gas cap.<br />i have a '98 ranger and this cap does not fit it, so i ordered a '99 cap. the '97 cap is threaded.<br />minor problem.
B00486NV5I|1|Advertised 1 1/4 came it is 1 inch
B00R6S0MEI|5|Great nozzle...had to turn to amazon reviews to figure out &#34;right turn off&#34;... happy with heavy duty device and as always thank goodness for amazon reviews!!
B00X8SVVQI|3|Happy with the performance of this device but I am stunned at how cheap they are by putting in a short 13&#34; supply power cord and no power block what so ever to attach it to the wall !!!!  They way it is packaged and shipped it is unusable unless you already have some gear that you want to sacrifice to make this thing work.
B004FI325I|5|IT'S LITTTTTT!
B001GF9ZP4|5|Easy install looks great
B00WID0OEE|5|Super happy. Works great for pet hair on furniture!!!
B00ELHT41Y|4|Just as I expected. Good delivery service
B004JBC7KW|4|left/right fit great thanks
B0067ECPS8|5|Great product
B000WK4B5I|4|They work good and easy to remove and lnstall.
B00230H1SO|5|Just what Hubby needed to adjust shocks on his Softtail
B00852684M|5|very cool design & effect
B00WPHV10O|5|Perfect size for my sedan's rear glass, looks great. The only unknown is how well it will hold up to commercial car washes.
B001NAP2EK|4|Giving four because the bottom was very poorly shrink wrapped. Otherwise seems well made and fit atv fine; a hard size to find in stores.
B00DYR04HU|4|Product works like original. Just took a while for shipping about 6 weeks.
B00L1CMFPO|5|Awesome love it
B005257R0O|5|Used this product to cover up the clear section of the tail light on my sidecar. The clear portion is for the license plate but as the plate is on the bike it is not needed on the sidecar lamp. Color was very close match to the lens. Only slight problem I had is the nozzle dripped a little so I would not use over a good finish area and maybe wear rubber gloves next time. This was a very minor problem for me.
B00WZ0YKV8|5|I have a 2013 Honda Civic SI and this matches it's exterior. Very unique
B001D6U8SO|1|I'm confused. This was suppose to be for my 07 Jeep Rubicon. One line says it adds a 4&#34; lift the other says 2.5&#34; with leaf springs and will only accommodate up to 33&#34; tires?<br /><br />Hey guys 07 jeeps have no leaf springs and I can put 33's on my stock Rubicon.<br /><br />I will be looking else ware to buy
B00KQXKG46|5|for the price works great
B00455TH3W|5|Look for the carb. model no. (ex. WT-30) and Zama or Walbro and then check Amazon for the right kit. Get the idle mixture screw tool(or set) from Amazon. Sometimes several kits can work. Stens has a catalog with parts for all types of equipment. 775-999 It has 1872 pages.
B000BYGDU6|5|Replacement for the stock cap in my '72 BMW.  It fits perfectly, just keep in mind this has the &#34;male&#34; tab when you fit it to the distributer.
B0006O2PBW|5|great
B000C3ZCT4|5|LOVE THESE SHOCLS ON MY FORD EXPLORER
B00296GLWO|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0013FU286|5|Really good this fit my pontiac grand prix 06<br />Thank you!
B00BFDFC54|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0038KNJQ6|1|Only worked once
B000GUYSBQ|5|Great.  Tried it out on my Yamaha Vstar and it fits perfectly on top of the rack and over the sissy bar.  Can't wait to put it to good use.
B005HAT9SM|5|I do recommend this. It's functional, not as a weapon.. It will come in handy in my truck this winter. Too, it balanced well.
B005FKLYQY|4|Easy to install as long as you have moderate mechanical skills. No special tools required. Came in one big box. Doesnt have any crazy stopping power but are suitable OEM replacement. At about 5k miles so far and no issues.
B00HDT08D0|5|Nice place for your spare key
B00076QA4C|2|I have a 2015 Ford Escape and with the configuration of the cargo compartment walls plus the fact that one has to screw into it, this won't work even though I put the car description in the search.  It should have been stated that it wouldn't work with the factory installed hooks and altering the interior of the car was necessary. The instructions showing this were also in a sealed container one has to open to find this out.
B0067ECRP4|1|This did not fit my 2008 Kia Rondo 2.7L V6 as stated in the compatibility page!  I bought three of them!  Took my vehicle in for an oil change and the mechanic told me that it was the wrong size and wrong thread.
B00IS941D2|5|Perfect fit, only issue. No place to run the wires for the kc lights. Hard to drill holes for that, but I would recommend the product for sure..
B004H2VTZM|4|Good value.
B001PYACBC|5|fit great
B001GP02PQ|1|Although the bulbs box says H11 on them, they don't fit unless you modify some of the plastic on the part of the bulb that screws in. The tabs are too big when comparing to the H11's that came out and the factory ones they look very similar but won't go right in unless you file down the little tabs. I would have returned but you have to remove half of the front of my truck to replace the headlights.
B00UJB3T3A|5|Great product fit our 2002 New Beetle perfectly at good price.
B001EAQTRI|5|completely fixed my issue in my car where there was a huge buzzing/whining noise from a bluetooth car adapter.<br /><br />Unit is small and inconspicuous, the cables are good in length. It is self powered, meaning you don't need a separate power source. Plug and Play (listen).
B00EJA3BU8|4|very nice.
B000C541W6|1|Parts sent do not match the picture. Parts sent have zerk fitting and cotter pin, just like the lower cost parts.
B000C9WL6A|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 polaris 850 xp
B00TUDPXQ4|4|Worked really well on my light colored seats
B00SU0V100|2|The description says it's 5X7 inches. It's actually 2X3 inches.
B0031W4WPS|5|Good quality for a good price. Completely satisfied.
B00AZQYBRC|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00KOTL3DA|5|Looks just like the image.  Great for my car!
B0045WQ1XE|1|wrong part was able to get it sold !
B00BD9R2TY|5|Great sound
B00QSFZ0U6|5|This kit meets OE spec. The picture shown is misleading, though. The nuts are all brass, it comes with washers, and all the studs are made out of steel. I would definitely buy again.
B007GRSLWY|5|Great helment, great price. Half off retail price. Very light. Looks and fits great.
B0001MQ7FO|5|Works.
B002IZFRHG|3|Doesn't stay in place. Had to remove the small legs
B00OAEDLYY|5|Love it
B0006HOW92|5|Worked great on my 1977 Corvette with new 17 inch wheels.
B001HZIGNU|4|The one hood bumper worked well on my 98' Acura Integra
B000C1LW0E|5|Happy
B006PAS0IS|4|Great mats, fit our 2012 Honda perfectly.  Decent quality.
B002ZS4QCS|4|I go a prettier set for my wife... this basic utilitarian set is for my car and work well and are very useful. Great price for a nice and seemingly sturdy attachment for the interior of your car.
B001BK6HH8|5|This drivers side mirror is still going strong after 10 months & 10k miles of heavy use, and nobody can tell the difference! It actually works better than the stock one.<br /><br />To get the result in my photo, you should use 3 coats of Dupli-Color brand paint (check the inside of your Corolla door for exact color code/name, and 2 coats of Dupli-Color brand clear coat for protection. Very easy job, and I have never painted parts before!
B0027687PU|5|Could use a few more &#34;1&#34; in the pack to allow numbering up to 19, but I cut down one of the extra &#34;7&#34;s.  Adhere well, fit for what I needed.
B007HMXN4O|5|Installed it in my 2008 335i. It fit perfect and worked properly. It's also a little quieter when opening and locking. It was a plug and play. So far so good.
B005C9UA4K|1|Key didn't fit ignition for 07 escalade . That's after having it cut at a Cadillac dealership
B00KTIQLXI|2|Did not work keyless unlock.  Only works the lock feature.
B0064RF7P6|5|Good product and came quick enough
B00PUOQRK8|5|It keeps my seat dry when I'm soaking wet from the gym.  It dries pretty quickly too.  I just ordered a second one for my passenger seat bc I liked it so much.
B0031I9KV8|5|What a deal! Great product for a great price! Yes thank you.
B005MZYKSQ|5|Very pretty for my themed car. Thank you.
B003S0B9EA|2|I drive a small sedan, and this coat hanger does not allow the rear door to close. Beware, amazon will not pay for the return shipping! So now I am stuck with this, and it just sits in my closet.
B00BV6V13W|5|Althought the estimated delivery time was 5 to 7 days the part was delivered within two days. The part fitted onto my car just right. I am very happy and would not hesitate buy thru this vendor again
B0040CRTK8|3|Price is right but too hard of material, only one time use.  If you want to remove them they will break.  Nice having a lot of extras.
B00ONH4UDY|5|Super easy to install plus it works great couldn't be happier shipping was fast got it in 2 days
B006DZN4NG|5|Works great and solved my Mustang's AC issue.
B00OTBCIRE|2|Bright light, but quality control is lacking as one of the mounting bolts to the light bar itself was not the correct size.. Was able to find a replacement at the local hardware store, but disappointed that I had to make the trip..  Just know that you are buying a cheap light bar and be ready to repair as needed..
B00UB38MX8|2|Game is fine but will continue running until you force stop......will eat up battery time fast and sends messages  to phone continuously
B00IMNI45U|5|Could have been packaged a little better. Decent price fast shipping, overall happy with product
B006ZS28X8|5|Best shine if you prepare your tires right.
B00651CLCS|3|I love the look of this, but I only get half of the channels now. I used to get tons of channels from different nearby towns, but now I only get the ones in the city. I listen to a lot of country stations but can only listen to about half. I will still keep it because it looks awesome.
B000XJG304|5|Used it to repair motorcycle seat that was separating on seam.  Easy to use with great results cannot see where rip was
B00MJNTUD4|4|Good fit and ventilation.  I like to ride with an open face and just a visor.  Easy to remove the face shield and replace with the visor.  The built in flip down visor hangs up in the helmet some times and I seldom use it.  My sunglasses work fine on sunny days
B00MB0DTQE|5|Cute, soft, and doesn't slip.
B00BJKJ7M2|5|Came early and the  club member that won them loves them!
B00NHBYOA6|1|The cooler worked fine while using it on and off for about six weeks, then it quit cooling.  Now it only warms.  We are now working directly with the manufacturer to get it repaired/replaced but expect to pay nearly a third of the price of the cooler for shipping and insurance to return it.  Based on my experience, I would not consider the cooler reliable and would not recommend it to anyone.  Because it is past the 30 days from original purchase, Amazon no longer can/will assist with the return/replacement process.  Beware return policies and manufacturer warranties!!
B000CIC1EI|5|Fits my 1995 Jeep Grand cherokee perfectly, good idea to replace this in a basic tune up!
B002HU2UJ0|5|I LOVE IT ...ITS REAL CUTE TO ....I LOVE IT  ON MY TRUCK THANKS YOU
B00B4WZEBI|1|Didn't work out of the box. Very disappointed.
B000EGMGBG|5|Easy to install, great results
B0002SRG4S|5|GOOD TOOLS
B000V6P9BS|4|Seems to have a positive impact on my 2007 Jeep Wranglers performance. They shipped in a good time. The throttle body came with the throttle body and four additional screws. Three of the screws were long enough to fit, one of the screws was to short. I had to go to Home Depot and get an additional screw to properly secure the throttle body. So I guess they need to work on there quality control. I didn't contact the seller and I kept the item as an additional $1.97 and a round trip to the nearest Home Depot (50 miles) wasn't worth the hassle.
B00141KZO0|5|FYI these fit 2013 VW Golf TDI...  There seems to be some issue in the reviews as to whether or not these are the correct replacements for post 2011 VW vehicles.  I know that the Jetta and the Golf share many of the same parts, and I suspect these fit post 2011 VW Jettas, I am certain these fit a 2013 golf TDI as they installed (and appear to be identical to the OE blades) in just a few seconds.
B0012TRFHO|1|Didn't work at all, very disappointed
B005HEXHX6|5|Work great
B006N9980K|1|These are garbage.  Replace before a trip from Florida to Michigan, and they were making noise by Louisville, Kentucky.
B004RROBT8|4|Day 1 review on my honda trx250 98' .. screws needed to be longer, they fit fine it just was a slightly more difficult to get the nut to bite, battery was charged and ready to go upon delivery.<br /><br />So far basically 4. 8 stars for a 25 dollar battery, will update later to see if it holds up
B001UCGHTU|5|works as advertised. Came with oil, but I had to empty it and measure the right amount to go back inside. I don't know if having an ounce or two extra would have mattered, but I did not want to take the chance. The fit was perfect and it came with the oil.
B001O07PU8|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B000X22E4U|4|They fit the car fine.  Have not fallen off in about two months.  They feel as good as the OEM caps.
B008YFT054|3|Low beams work fine,... High beams are low light  power
B00029WSWC|4|I put this on my Ford F150 Pickup truck, this allows me to quickly see what is behind me with out having to look hard at the side mirror, you are alert to everything behind you and too the side. It is not that bug which is good, as it does not obstruct front vision, it is maybe one each larger on each side of a standard mirror.  Fits perfect over the standard Ford basic mirror, it has built in clamp/vise that is spring loaded, and clamps on your existing mirror. I had no problem adjusting to using it.
B00XVS8XNE|5|Good quality. Much cheaper than auto parts store.
B004BTB7WQ|5|Very fast shipping excellent product
B004HA0842|5|Bad ass, exactly what I was looking for
B00QXTYZDK|3|It's a little lighter weight than what we thought it would be. But does a good job.
B000F09CF4|5|I bought this product based on the recommendation of other vintage sewing machine collectors.  So when I found another machine at the thrift store for $20,but it was froze up, the wheel wouldn't turn.  I took the gamble that I could get it to work using the Kroil.  Yes, yes!!  it works just as promised!  Love it!  Will recommend it to others!
B000IYBFFC|5|had to replace on my 2003 mazda protege, it worked. not much more to say
B002P8LWDO|4|This fit great and installed very easily on my 2005 Corolla CE. The only complaint I had was that the mirror seems to be a little warpy and the image is a little distorted, but not enough to affect my driving. Maybe this is from the California heat? Either way, for the price, I still completely recommend this item if your mirror is damaged.
B00G620ZVU|5|Perfect light just like described
B000WK4ELE|5|Easy to apply, and really works to keep evil rust away from my Harley chrome. I live steps away from the gulf of Mexico and rust is a major issue. I love having this in my arsenal of cleaning products and will be using it for years to come.<br />I especially had problems with the Kuryakyn aftermarket parts rusting. They rusted very quickly, to the point where I took all of that garbage off and went with genuine Harley parts. Still, even the better Harley chrome can't resist the salt air forever without help. This is just the ticket.
B009W9F0F0|5|Fit was great.  Install takes a bit of doing especially if you are going to install the optional bolts (you really should)  I had a 90* drill and with the suggested drill bit size it simply wouldn't fit in the console to drill the whole.  I ended up using a tiny bit to drill a pilot hole then drilled the final size from the outside.  This thing is built sturdy it would be a huge pain for someone trying to get into it.  I really like the way the latch is built.
B00HV0S69O|5|My daughter loves this! Thanks!
B00HEF54VO|1|This did not work.  It takes &#62; 1 hour to uninstall the old one and install the new one.  Reset the computer, drove less than 20 miles and the CEL came back on with the same code.  Bought one from the dealer, worked perfectly.  Several mechanics I have spoken to subsequently say save your time and $, buy this part from the dealer.
B00KWMNI6Y|3|its ok not very good
B000EOEV2U|3|Heavy!
B000W0WSPI|5|worked great
B0079GQ4YY|1|I bought a size 10 boot which I normally wear, and my toes were touching the ends. Not only did the boots run small in size, but there was a permenant wrinkle in the insole by my toes. Would not be able to wear the boot even if the boot fit.
B00K9BFBOK|5|go cali
B00WQPEP9E|5|worked great coded my car with amazing features bmw forgot .. fast shipping
B008R199IS|5|A fantastic bargain. Use your mid belly measurement for size and I added some Klim suspenders, seem to work well so far.
B003YMTJ2G|5|Installed a pair of these rotors on my 2006 Acura TSX and now the car stops very smooth.
B000C8T86M|5|Included everything I needed besides fluid for my filter and fluid change. High quality parts and no issues so far.
B00DCF24W2|2|Very good quality leather.  They are a rather strange cut, short in the fingers and tight in the palm.  I've never had a glove feel this off.  I cant pull in the clutch and turn on my blinker- same issue with the throttle and break. the seemed unsafe and I essentially stopped using them.
B00EDRA3FI|3|Did not fit over the nut it was suppose  to. Clock is fine used velcro instead to mount the clock.
B000GRS2G6|5|For the price, this has been a great cover. All the others fell apart much faster, and this one is heavy duty, goes on, and doesn't fly off easily.
B0031YD15I|1|They were cut fine for me but if Im going to smoke my side markers (tail lights etc) I want transparent material. Not blacked out where light doesnt shine through.
B00FC22HUM|5|Ugh, these headlights are simply amazing, you've gotta love 5k's
B000FFQVV2|5|perfect fit
B0041F8B8I|5|Priced too high
B000BZ545U|5|Great product like always
B001LHVOVK|5|Works as described
B000CB6D0S|5|Factory fit and easy to replace. OEM quality.
B009KARSK6|5|Very sleek and clean on my Q50. Higher quality metal.
B000IYYTPK|5|this will keep the thieves out of my truck gas
B005XBQN7U|5|A+
B000H29WL4|4|These are the correct replacement item for my OEM headlights. I don't think they are any brighter or clearer than OEM, but they do a good job and the price is right.
B000C801AY|1|The TS334 overreads for me by 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Your engine, by the dash gauge, will appear as if it's overheating. Others have reported similar problems with cheap temperature sensors. An alternative is Echlin TS6685 which gives the correct reading.
B000IY6URK|5|great o.e. wires for my hyundai at a great price
B003TP3FCS|5|Awesome and fast
B00PWY7JFI|3|Run a little small and well made though
B000M5YDT2|5|reasonable price
B000AME522|5|nice as expected
B000B5QFE4|5|These were a perfect fit for our Ford 150 - very easy to take on/off and gives a much wider viewing range.
B00H4ZC5DO|5|Fit my Woods mower idler pulleys perfectly.
B00G2GRY4Q|3|Does the job. The tab to open it isn't very strong; be very careful how much force you use, mine broke on day 2.
B00CMY2LFE|4|High quality, beautiful colors (we’ve bought red, navy and black in various car mfg.). You can find these for many different cars.  With keys attached on both ends, it’s long, for me a bit too long.  So I sometimes take the push clip release ring on to the spring release so it doesn't dangle so much.  Other than that our family loves them.
B000FGEF9G|2|Well, the other reviews don't say which end of the adjuster you pull up to fit it to your original cup spot.  Doesn't matter, as both ends broke off in my hands, when I pulled on them.  Will return it.
B00L40ZQGS|5|Good stuff. I use it for my balls.
B00D7QHSKY|4|good side and fit nice
B000RFP468|2|Not complete for 2005 E-450.
B00112RGXK|1|Streak free for me, but leaves a white residue (in the form of specs of the sheets) all over the place. The whole point of this product is to make the glass (essentially) invisible, and it fails.
B00407V6BG|5|Actually matches amazingly, still a little over priced for such a small can of paint. Matched my car's factory paint perfectly.
B005FKSD40|3|They do squeal at times and also not a fan of the noise that the rotors make (sounds like a playing card in a bicycle spoke wheel)using them on a 2010 Ford Explorer 4×4
B003TTXICG|1|Wrong size ordered
B003UM9GDM|5|I bought this for my son, and he loves it. Well worth it
B00SZK1420|5|I put the Opt7 5202 CREE LED bulbs in my 2013 Black Diamond LTZ Avalanche.  Installation is pretty straight forward.  I do recommend you use a little bulb grease on the o-ring prior to installing.  Lights then slide in and clip in place securely.  Love the hid look so much better than the factory yellow bulbs. I would recommend them to upgrade your factory yellow fog light bulbs.  Can't wait to try the headlights for my truck as well as see what they have for my other rides!<br /><br />Just bought a set of the 881's now too.  Great product will keep changing my fleet over as I get the chance!
B00OJGVETC|5|Fits my car dash perfectly. Nice color, I got gray, nice thick dash cover. Great quality.
B007KQ8LY4|3|Not too smelly
B00FCG7RWQ|5|Much better starting power than factory John Deere battery.  3 minute installation
B010FXXFYO|2|Not sticking well to the bumper on my car. Maybe better on a smoother surface like the window
B002X1NLOQ|5|perfect, easy in easy out
B000WJYMMQ|5|works great, looks great.
B0076C8WLE|5|I love it. It fits exactly on my key. Not too thick or bulky. Came in a white little package. Delivered right on time.
B004ADYFXG|4|Outstanding
B000JUXGK2|5|it works great,just make sure you have a spare in the boat.they do malfunction and will sooner or latter.remember they are only guaranteed for three years.i mention a boat,because i have had two quit working in the last ten years, while in ocean waters off bodega bay ca..
B000MK5NC8|4|Packing was good with no damage to package or product. All hardware included including the EPA sticker. Very satisfied with material of intake. Provided new gasket for air mass sensor which fit good and tight with no air leaks. Very much like the actual box of the filter. Volant has a ram air you can buy extra to route to the front of vehicle to ram in air from the front. I chose to leave the upper cover open. The only bad is the 4th hole for the bottom of the box did not align. The other 3 bolts lined up and was more than secure enough for the housing. Filter element just like most. Filter came pre oiled ready to go. Love the size of the air filter. Great product and I would recommend this.
B007HRKKBS|4|I research EVERYTHING.  This product seems high quality and has worked fine for me.
B00393NDHW|2|They not illuminate either have a very dim light
B00OYAFMN2|2|The kids version 2.0 breaks at the rubber hinge area and is known issue and they are suppose to be redesigning this.  What do they do ? they release an adult version with the same hinge , not a review for this product , but it it the same design as the kids. They could easily fix this by making it a 2 piece-we got one year and a few days of use out of our 2.0-so missed the magical one year and out 265$. Company would do nothing except say they are working on the known problem? Then release the adult version knowing it is a problem?
B000JL0CV2|5|Fits perfect, looks nice, works as represented.
B000GU7DGS|5|As others have said, the alarm is very loud and it fits snugly within the DOWCO Guardian Weather All Plus cover. I chose to lock the the alarm to the break disk and it holds very well.. Have not put it to the test yet but if so, I'm sure this thing will scare the hell out of the thief (that is if he/she does not remove it slowly before when reading the big DOWCO logo on the cover)
B000NOZLWU|5|Perfect, Thank you.
B00NIDNV5C|5|works so far.1 week in
B00REJXHIM|4|Very nice ,looks great only took 10 minutes to install!!
B00BQ6YRNS|5|Perfect! Does exactly what it says it does! Very nice looking on my 2005 Silverado pickup!
B00O3H5ZA6|3|Very nice. I returned product.  I needed a larger cage.
B000LUDEOI|4|Good
B000GD5FMY|1|Too bad he is 7. Least they fit him. For the price I should have known they wernt aduld glasses....
B0068XM1B4|5|Beautiful shift knob
B00KI1TMNM|1|This does not store enough power in the cold weather to jump start a car! Very unhappy with it!!
B0012WHBSO|5|I thought a while before spending $42.00 on a portable air  compressor but I am glad I did. I like quality products and this is a quality product. The compressor is very quiet and very solid. It's all compressor with no bulky case around it. Here are the specs.<br /><br />Weight: 5 lbs.<br />Dimensions: L 6in, W 3.25in, H 6 in.<br />Cord Length: 16 feet.<br />Air Hose Length: 4 feet<br />Pressure Gage: 0-150 psi<br />Fused Line Cord (14 amp automotive type fuse)<br />Max Amps: 14<br />Max Pressure: 100 psi<br />Flow Rate: 1.27 cfm.<br /><br />Things I like:<br />Screw on brass air hose fitting. (Can do with one hand.)<br />Rubber feet<br />Easy to read pressure gage<br />Handle<br />Cord and hose length<br />Quality of material and workmanship<br />Nylon zipper storage bag<br />Ball and toy fittings<br />One Year limited warranty<br /><br />When inflating  car tires the pressure gage will indicate about four pounds higher than the actual inflation pressure so you need to turn off the compressor to check the real inflation pressure. The pressure gage is very steady during inflation. The compressor  is quiet with very little vibration.<br />This is just a great product.
B0031ZDU62|5|Awesome
B009AVSBJM|5|very heavy duty, easy to install, and flawless finish.
B00H29M71W|5|Works great so far and i only needed one not two so now i have a spare. I used it for a aux fan for the ac on my truck.
B0006VORDY|5|Works extremely well, very pleased with this stove. Primary use is cooking and canning outdoors...two burners means we can run two canners at a time.
B00DDZE33E|5|perfect fit for raft
B00LLZFIJ6|4|Hopefully will never have to use it, but it is a nice tool to have in the key chain.<br /><br />Do take the time to learn to use like how to pull off the key chain quickly and try the window breaking tool<br />on something like a ream of paper.  Like any tool, it is useless unless you know how to use it.
B003E1WQWM|5|Works well. There may be a little interference on the big ends of this thing with the chain hooks.  I'm afraid over time the rubber will wear off from that but overall I like the fit.
B0015PRSEU|5|Easy install, Bright, Nice clean look
B00YYDOFG4|1|Grille badge defective and did not include installation instructions or diagram
B00HFWZ1NW|4|Thank you
B00C3V9BGI|4|Arrived immediately the next day, in the AM. I opened my Amazon to see when it would arrive, and it was already delivered to my front door. Great! I could not source it locally so this was perfect. Thanks! I will update to 5 stars based on the chain itself after I try it out.
B004MZJD02|5|It worked out well.
B001879CUS|1|Made my top look worse then before. I followed the directions too...
B00CZC6JXS|4|The set was just what we needed for our son. The helmet is sturdy but not as heavy as an adult helmet. The chest protector was a bit too large but we tied some fabric across the shoulder blades to tighten it up. They let us request different sized helmet and gloves in the same set which was great. Also a screw came off that held the arm piece to the chest protector and I contacted the company and they immediately responded and sent us two replacement screws.
B007NQ271O|3|Just ok
B0089K6J6C|5|Great product for replacing or adding keys to your honda!
B0124DKVXG|5|I love UBER first of all!  It is great to have the car magnets to remind people about it or make people aware of UBER.<br />The magnets work very well. I haven't had a problem with them falling off. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
B00KHC7BUI|5|i made this to carry my canoe a long time ago and someone had to still my idea real nice people live from others
B008XNZZ7O|3|It smelled great for a few days but the smell didn't last long.
B004HYU6DG|5|Fit as it should. No leaks.
B003YMVOJC|5|Nice quality and the price and quick delivery were more than I expected
B00W5UCY9I|4|Decent organizer for my SUV. I was able to easily store three heavy beach towels and a small can of propane and there was room for more. It was also easy to install -- I personally didn't use the buckles as the straps were elastic, so I just slipped it over the headrests in my Explorer. As a mom of four, I can definitely see how much this is going to make my life easier. Instead of carrying a diaper bag around everywhere, I can fill this up with diapers and wipes and have an on-the-go changing station. It's also perfect for older kids who are involved in sports and lug around a ton of gear. We'll also use it for camping to help us organize some of our gear and goodies. It would also be great to fill with emergency supplies, such as jumper cables, a blanket, a first aid kit, flashlight, etc. Since it hangs upright on the back of the seat, it doesn't interfere with bringing home groceries or carrying any other cargo.<br /><br />When you first get it, be careful opening the package. I didn't realize it was a 'pop open' style (like some tents) and it scared the crap out of me when I opened the bag because I wasn't expecting it ;)<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with my purchase and happy with this backseat organizer.<br /><br />---PROS---<br />» Lots of space for organization<br />» Various size pockets/compartments for storing a variety of items<br />» Takes up very little space<br />» Easy to install<br />» Lightweight<br /><br />---CONS---<br />» The buckles are not adjustable and the straps are elastic, so the organizer will sag with weight.<br /><br />I received a discount on my purchase of this organizer for my honest and unbiased review. The opinions are my own and based on my use of the backseat organizer. I only review products that I am fully confident recommending to my own friends and family.
B0002FEEQY|4|Have not yet used from this container, but product is good.
B00LNNR9GG|4|So Far so good, I have a 2013 F150 Fx4 with Factory Hids and thay almost match up perfect. Happy and will return if need be in the future.
B00M75YUIY|5|100% working good
B0007TQWJM|5|Perfect for my small sailboat trailer. Capable of handling most trailers, I'm sure.
B00MX8IKVI|1|I don't know if it was user error or what, but when I tried to put it on my car, the sticker just came to pieces..
B004OI7H7S|2|This stuff hardens really quickley and hardened in the gun so wasn't able to spray te whole bed. Barley started now have to buy everything again. Any suggestions for when I try again
B00HPI4H4A|5|Good quality. Nice colors just as pictured. My son was so happy when he opened his present.
B000VAZ8L0|5|works as expected
B00KGIBG04|5|It's working good
B00QHZV7IQ|5|fantastic results, this is a total versatile camera , easy app download that literally took less that two minutes on android. doesn't reverse the image so you need to  train your brain to get on the trailer ball, but if your backing up a trailer you had already be used to a little challenge. super clear image
B008LLVU2C|5|Excellent Product. Fit perfect 2010 Lexus RX 350. Photo attached.
B000O5DV70|5|Simple install. A bit of drilling required, but if you've got the tools, then you're likely able to do the job in under 2 hours. I have installed a few hitches before, but this was pretty much the easiest yet. I'll only be using it as an accessory hitch ( bike rack, cargo rack etc..),  so I didn't bother with the taillight kit.. I might though, if I find I want to tow my utility trailer with it. Draw-tite is a great product.. As always!
B00SCXCQV8|5|High Quality and low prices ! Awsome light at night !
B0068D3WLW|2|Just so so. Way overpriced and needs a broader surface on end of bolt to give it more grip. Beyond that well made.
B00A7I39LW|4|For the price, it's hard to beat. That being said, when your life is on the line, shouldn't you spend a little more? The helmet is about a half size smaller than other helmets with the same size rating so if you're a medium, go large. The visor fogs up like crazy in the cold and at any temp when you are stopped. You can use an anti fog spray or get an anti fog visor. There are minor quality control issues on MY helmet but nothing that would affect safety. It's tight because of the aforementioned sizing issue however it's still comfy. The chin strap is super convenient and has ruined other helmets for me lol. It's vents kinda suck but as long as you're moving, it's not bad. Overall, price is the biggest factor for the high rating. Ditch the breath guard and get a tinted, fog proof visor and you're golden.
B00WQWXMJQ|4|Great helmet, only draw back is looking over to change lanes visor lifts but other than that no complaints
B000NCOKZQ|3|A advertised... good quality... better option for trickle charging batteries on less often used equipment such as boats, farm equipment, and RV's...
B0039HD6YS|4|Great fit on the 2004 Wrangler!  Time will tell on he durability!
B003VAWRLG|5|I have a lifted Toyota Tacoma with an aftermarket tubular bumper so I needed a huge drop.  This filled the bill nicely.  Works great.
B00HF0Z29W|5|Does everything they claim!
B007BWW9VS|5|Took the guts out of a dead FOB and inserted into this one...works like a champ.
B0022ZOJGM|5|Fits perfect on 04 Honda rebel
B005FFZC76|5|Love them!
B00BTLEIIY|5|perfect
B00R8FE5N8|5|Great service. I will use them again.
B00CPGGZNS|5|Great product. Fast and easy shipping. Extremely easy to assemble and install!
B00J7RB72M|1|Thin and flimsy. Sleeves perforated but not cut out. Becomes snug and hard to fit discs the more you fill it up.
B00WXT57R2|5|Good quality decal.
B007J31VCC|5|these stickers are awesome! good quality and nice design! loved them
B005ADY8V4|5|Pipe stretcher works very well even with 4&#34; pipe.  The only issue i had is the pipe won't stretch out evenly unless you loosen the stretcher, rotate it and stretch the pipe again to make it more round.  It works great for the do-it-yourself-er.
B00118XMKA|5|I don't remember exactly when I bought these, but they have outlasted the factory lights and then some. I bought these because the factory lights were breaking and falling off of the truck. They look great, held up the only thing I did was add a little bit of silicon after I made the wire connections to water proof them.
B000CSQETQ|5|I was going to buy a Motorcraft Coil-on-plug for $44 but found I could buy the whole set of eight for the same price!  I installed these on our church van that had a miss in #6 cylinder and it worked perfectly.  I figured if one the new ones should go bad I can always replace just that one with an OEM Motorcraft.  It's been a month and so far so good!  I would recommend replacing the fuel rail injector o-rings too since you have to get them out of the way for access to the coil-on-plug units.
B000AL8VD2|5|Always use dielectric grease when replacing spark plugs.  Good stuff!
B0009IQZFM|2|It worked well twice and since then it absorbs little and just spreads the water around. Disappointing as Meguier's products are usually excellent.
B00IMPEWHM|5|yhanks
B000CMHVBC|5|I have used these shades before. I am glad I was able to get more from amazon. These shades really keep the car cool compared to the inside shades. Because, the inside shades does not prevent the windshield from the heat in turn heat transfer into the car. These shades are a bit hard to get used to in the beginning but a breeze later hooking it up.
B00CA09LEO|5|Works great
B00BYX62J0|5|Fits perfect and sounds good
B00C873Y60|5|Items as described, great prices, quick shipment, will use again.
B00404WDUC|5|Great product! I'm really happy with it. Works very well, and is very accurate. Also, it is very well constructed and seems like it's going to last me a very long time. Definitely recommend.
B00V5XYG9W|1|not a match
B004YD1VIY|4|does what it is suppose to do, and I like it because they are metal and not plastic like the ones I had before which eventually bend out of shape.
B0088LL7UA|5|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B004X96DQY|3|good but it is not perfect, any way it is better than other products for strong and deep scrachs.
B00829OA34|5|Great clutch! Replaced clutch on 2008 civic SI with Type R transmission swap. Only had chance for 30 mile break in. It survived over 400 miles competing in World Rally Cross Ojibwe Rally boucing off the rev limiter the whole way:)
B00M78820I|5|This is pretty basic, easy to use -- and it works.  Can't ask for much more.
B00KTJ4RUG|4|It came earlier than expected and it work fine compatible with my car.
B00U2C2BS0|5|Great products at unbeatable prices.  Expedite delivery and superb customer service.
B00IUVEPC0|3|Way too small. I have a small face but these are tiny. Should be marketed for children or something!
B00XN63KZU|5|looks great
B004TRKBOK|5|We have one of these in each of our cars.  Just gave a 1995 Tahoe to my grandson for his first car and equipped it with<br />an emergency car kit and added one of these to it.  You never know when you may need this tool!!!!
B000COCTXA|1|This kit, as stated before, is garbage.  The seal around the metal spray nozzle is non-existent and just sprays the majority of fluid right at my wipers.  You can waste time trying to screw around with this as much as you want, but since the seal can't hold pressure, it just dumps on your car hood.  Disappointing...poor quality...need this to be better.
B00M5ETU32|5|Worked out well
B00GUF74HQ|5|Installed in less than 20 minutes. Instructions were good with full color step by step pictures.  Make sure you have metric tools available as it calls for a 5mm allen and 10mm wrench.
B001LQLTRA|5|Love it on my 2013 Denali
B00WWCG2XS|5|Excelent product
B000OAXV6G|4|System is great. East to install and sounds nice. Only issue I have is packing could be better. The muffler had a small bent in it from one of the hangers from another pipe. Not a real issue for me since it won't affect the sound or performance.
B0002FU44K|5|Works as advertised not much else to say.
B009XAR2CM|3|Looks like a more expensive model you can get at auto parts store, but it is not as heavy duty.  The hose is thinner and the brass fitting on the end is out of round..
B00KTJ3ZMW|5|Check your keys first before ordering these keys. All the keys cutting outlet has a device that you can stick you keys through and find out if your keys has a programmable chip. My 2006 Ford F250 does not have a chip so it only cost me $ 3.00 for another key to start my truck. Another review on here had the same vehicle but their key had a chip. So they had to have two original keys to program the keys. I check both of the keys I order and they did light up. Walmart also will program your keys cheaper than the dealership. So if I could do it all over again. I would buy my keys at Walmart and have them program the chip.
B000VU57YS|5|Nothing moves on this mat !
B00E63THQA|5|Great bottle kept my water very cold
B00T62RK1U|3|I bought these particular lights based off a review I seen of them in a video on Youtube. Was instructed to buy the brand Auxbeam since they were compared with other lights similar to them by other sellers. The review highlighted the differences in quality and lead you to believe Auxbeam was superior to the others...WELL this is the truth. The mounting brackets are cheap thin and paint scratches off them with your fingernail. There is no rubber grommet in the light where the power wires enter into the housing. The lights themselves have no markings that label them as Auxbeam like in the video review I watched or the picture of the item I purchased here on Amazon. The LED's are not centered and the reflector does not go down flush with the LED like the comparison that was made in the video. As for performance well they are not water proof and as for impact resistant I would be skeptical yet the video did a pretty good torture test on the lights. Problem is I think the lights I received are not the same as the ones made by Auxbeam in the video. The lights are bright for their purpose, throw off a flood like spot and seem to be working well for the price you'd pay for them. I am happy so far as I didn't expect too much in quality but I was disappointed to see they did not represent the ones in the picture or the video and the ad description leads you to believe they are superior to other exact type LED lights being marketed and sold by other competitors.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzpXpOtM36o
B00B1N3CXC|1|Did not work on my winch. False advertising.
B0008FUH46|4|Doesn't fit flush but it works nonetheless
B00BITIRNO|5|Product is a perfect factory replacement. It installs very easily in minutes.
B00LUSVTHE|1|NOT bright at all.  very dim lights.
B005MVXTCI|1|Misfire codes. Replaced with Bosch. Do not go cheap on your coils.
B00NWT04NY|3|part fits fine but is very stiff to rotate key - removed and tried to rotate just the switch - it's very stiff - installed anyway figured it would loosen up after using awhile
B00E2U59XW|1|It has water in it and the paint / powder coat is garbage it changed colors from black to brown
B00LEX5MGY|5|Great product
B00AQ29F80|5|Stylin and profilin' in my 2003 Elantra with less than 100,000 miles.  Love them.
B003TUNRGM|5|Great sound deadening material and easy to install. I used this FatMat material for sound deadening in my 2015 Corvette C7. Works great. I highly recommend this product. Easy to install. Great price point. High quality.
B00ODLVBWS|4|Ok
B004JJ1KOI|5|The floor mats are great!Thank You
B001JT757M|5|They are cool look good on my benzo
B000E3XIPM|5|Great
B001HQHYFA|5|great
B00NV50BTG|5|So far so good. This is the brightest back-up bulb you're going to find is amazingly bright. It also looks incredible in clear taillight housing.
B005CWSBT8|5|perfect
B002EO8LGK|5|It works really good, thanks.
B00480GZ9I|4|Very bright and simple to install
B0039OTLRW|5|Does its job. There is nothing else that needs to be said. Better than generic coolant, obviously.
B002UCAHKE|5|Replaced older ones on my RV bed. Fit perfectly and easy to install. Raises and lowers like it should. Fast delivery and packaged securely.
B00CJEXQ6K|5|excellent
B00O2AXTHK|5|Product was excellent
B00RW81N9A|5|Quality product. Would purchase again.
B00IACGFOA|5|Very good slightly heavy but overall good product so far.
B00TY78AAM|5|I have an 07' Yaris and it fits great the back is a little big but that can be fixed easy. Love them and would buy it again!
B000XQ9MGE|5|Awesome jumped several vehicles before recharge needed
B002XLBMZQ|5|Lookes good on my truck and works great
B00FVE9Z6U|4|I had an electrician put in a 50A breaker in my panel and a 6-50 outlet right beneath it. My single complaint is that the cord from the station to the outlet is REALLY short. That part was a pain in the butt. Make sure you allow some space between the outlet and the breaker panel so you have room to mount it.
B00B1F0INW|5|Perfect fit for a 2015 Rav4 LE
B00GJMOKPO|5|Really nice product. Good Quality.
B000TYQ9GQ|5|Perfect
B00361B8KG|5|Great
B00UCAQXVI|5|Very pretty.  Worked perfectly with the interior color combination of our Jeep Renegade.
B00T36Q7R2|1|This unit failed almost immediately.  When I plug it it, it starts the delay count-up while it supposedly analyzes the connection, but it never completes. The display goes whacko, then it reboots and starts again, and again, .  It never finishes the start-up process. I had high hopes for this unit as the specs look very good.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the promise.  If there were more positive reviews for it, I might just exchange it for a replacement.  But, since this model is so new and there are no glowing reviews it is going back for a refund.
B00VMVWAW2|5|Perfect for keeping your registration and &#34;emergency cash&#34; in an easy to find folder, that folds flat so does not take up a lot of space.
B009IJAWD4|5|so far so good
B00PT18QAQ|5|Top quality gauge. Really pleased. Sometimes a thing is just a thing. And sometimes it's designed and built so well that it becomes something more. Satisfying to hold and a pleasure each time you use it. I don't remember what the description says, but a couple of my favorite features are: the swiveling end that goes on the tire valve, so you can rotate the gauge and see it no matter where the valve stem is. And, it holds the reading till you press the release button. The rubber guard looked a little silly in the pictures, but it's a) very effective, and b) just a rubber guard over a metal housing, not a molded plastic housing with fins.
B00CODDZNK|5|Great vest!
B0076C8WLE|4|Originally, I had a leather cover on my three year old Lexus remote, but it to frayed where the thin strands of leather are present between the sets of buttons. This happened as a result of pulling  the remote in and out of my pocket over time. The  rubber replacement is quite nice durable, but the feel is not as nice as leather.  My &#34;best of both worlds solution&#34; was to install the rubber cover on my remote, and cut out the worn and damaged parts of the leather cover, and then install the leather cover back over the rubber cover. End result, double remote protection, and the feel of leather rather than the feel of rubber.  Works for me!
B004KATMNC|5|Look great nice and bright ! Great purchase
B000LG3DBG|4|After 6 months still looks good
B000TTILSK|5|perfectly fit my 2007 Subaru Forester 2.5X
B00R9VY5X6|5|Perfect as described and beautiful! I love the colors and the seller was wonderful.
B00MWQ6J7S|3|Looks really nice but they not ERROR FREE
B00Y6F0RL2|3|They fit, but only after tweaking it in the vice.  Color is CLOSE to Honda red, but not quite!  They were cheap though, and have performed their function.
B003L2XPBK|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B00FZGY4CE|4|Bolts right on, no need to change any wire harness interfaces. Works as expected but was a bit costly.
B001PYCJLI|4|Working great
B007S3KIDQ|4|Works good but would be better if it locked open while retracting the inner portion of the landing gear. Because it doesn't lock open it takes 2 hands to retract and on my 5th wheel and that means laying on the ground. Other than that it works perfectly and installed easily.
B007NNKA9I|5|Works great. No problems with it. Looks exactly like the old one.
B003AVV6OK|2|For the 2000 suburban the frame bushings are too small. The sway bar links are good but the frame has about 1/8&#34; of play all the way around.
B007Y8XZ58|1|Is very spensive
B00BSUE80O|5|looks great
B00GMNL8LO|5|Good fit.
B001PWA0IO|4|Great produce but don't pay attention to the specific number of turns it tells you to make with the wrench because it's not close to accurate.
B000C16XKS|5|I have an 01 Pontiac Grand Am SE1 and it fit perfectly.
B00QJEDP0I|5|Great product.
B003PHXB6U|5|Excellent product, not too hard to install if you have the tools! super clear installing instructions, very nice looking on the vehicle. great purchase!
B0029N7R6G|5|I bought 10 of these to Decorate tree branches for my wedding. They turned out great
B00P3IAYSC|1|These are not good tiedowns I've used them five times in one already broke I had to cut  because the spring broke that releases the strap .
B00V30J86I|1|Unless you carry a very small purse, this is too small. A wallet would fit, but not much else. Also, if your front seats don't have the adjustable headrest, there's nowhere to hook it.
B00WNBKDRE|4|Got what was wanted
B000WK21JQ|5|Was very surprised it was a hard cover book. Very impressed for the price!
B00HTV2GSM|5|Thread pattern seemed a bit different than the oem one.  Ran it in pulled it back out, put some Teflon tape on it and put it back in. Works great.
B0000AY9KE|1|Worked great.
B000CGHV5Y|3|good quality
B00W4AC56G|5|It says waterproof and it actually is. The back of the el camino was a pool. I had to get some plywood and foam to keep the bed from becoming mosquito paradise!
B003YMVOUG|5|Work
B00JFMBGOI|5|Works perfect, allows you to adjust carrier exactly where it needs to be!
B00HV0RW62|4|I LOVE my new seat covers! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the floor mats that are listed are not a matching pair. They are a different color than the seat covers, slightly lighter with a little more of a purple color to it. The color difference is not a HUGE difference, and the fact that they lay on the floor and are not exactly next to the seat cover help make it not so noticeable. I have all weather rubber floor mats over the mats anyways, so to me it's not that big of a deal. Just a reference for future buyers. Other than that, the seat covers are very cozy, they fit my 2012 Mazda2 perfect!
B00JUWIJPW|5|Used to clean dirty sunbrella top. Worked well, removed dirt and stains by scrubbing with soft brush. Rinse well, then treat with 303.
B0009V1WS4|1|Didn't work for me.  Sent it back.
B00ZVQEXC4|5|Fast and good price
B00XWBK1Q2|5|Love it they really light up the sides of the bike !! For vehicles can see you better
B007QBW4S2|5|Good product
B000C4NPH4|5|Its works great . Its one of my best buy and no problem with it
B007QQRKXG|5|Does everything I have needed so far
B003CKFP5K|5|Its nice that these batteries are shippable and adding the acid to them was pretty easy.
B00V89F7QE|5|Best ballast to buy. Due to this one being waterproof and other ballast aren't usually water proof.
B00CI96CJ4|5|Looks great, stands up to the weather, car washes, etc.  Great product!
B008MP2W42|4|Just installed this grille in my 96 2500.  A couple things you may encounter:<br />At first i was unsure if it would fit at all.  Some holes would be perfectly lined up, others way off.  Instead of forcing or pushing the grille to line all the screw holes up, completely remove it and try again.  It took me about 8 complete removals and repositionings of the new grille before all the holes lined up perfectly.  Then it was easy.  A hair off one way or the other will just make you push on the grille and possibly break it.  The tolerances are tighter on this new grille than my old one.  Do not apply force!  Remove and reposition the ENTIRE grille until everything lines up.  If you have a need to push on one side or the other, it's not centered correctly.  Gently remove it and reposition it until everything lines up.  No force.
B0081S8OZG|4|Got this from DB electricial, packaging was very good, the motor is fine too.
B00KTHU1QM|5|i love my remotes. they were easy to program and they arrived just as planned. i haven't had any issues.
B009FTLPBU|1|Overprice, overrated, not brighter than stock,   follow up review, I discover after 5 minutes of continuous use, the LED reduce its brightness the 60%, when the led or circuit gets hot, very disappointing, hence one star.
B0051D3MP6|5|Excellent product, working as advertised.
B009SAMEBQ|5|The product came 2 days early, and i cannot be happier with the quality. This really exceeded all of my expectations. Great job!
B009CYGBHG|1|Very Bad quality
B00L7X9BN6|2|The left blinker don't work
B00HVV60HI|3|Ok, so I had an issue with my car so I decided to go with this model since it's on the &#34;cheap side&#34; of the OBD2 scanners. What you need to know is you are going to spend an extra 9.99$ in the mobile application if you are an iOS user like me. The scanners comes with a less than helpful mini disc containing effy looking programs with key generators and everything, just makes it look sort of home made by some guy in his house downloading games and cracking them. Of course at first I tried using the programs in the CD but the thing is there are 4 different programs with no explanation at all so you just have to play roulette and install one of them or go for the 4 and be stuck with useless junk in your PC,<br /><br />After I got the mobile app finally I got the scanner working, but still failing to clear the fault codes. So if you are willing to go trough the same as me buy this one, if not well you might as well go for the expensive ones or cut the crap and take it to the mechanic itself.
B001ELZE6E|5|Product was as described
B008J151H4|5|great
B008FZAZ2U|5|this thing is so funny!! i love it! its not hard at all to install but it didn't come with instructions so i improvised and it was successful, over all it was well worth the money, now i have something to laugh at every time i get in the car.
B0040D2QVE|3|I wish it was one piece rather than two pieces than couple.  They don't always keep the door snapped together.
B005ASY23I|4|It works well but gets extremely hot after use, watch yourself when handling.
B0060I4UN4|5|perfect, use it as a outdoor shower flooring and drainage away from the pop up shower
B005JU5VUK|5|After years of using those rain-x wipers with metal spines, I switched to these one piece type wipers.  I wanted to give bosch a try since I know they produce a lot of OEM products anyway.  All I can say is WOW.  These were not only the easiest wipers I've ever installed (took me literally 30 seconds for both wipers), but they are the best functioning wipers I've ever used.  My windshield spray is no longer useless in removing dead bugs and road debris.  These things don't just wipe water away in the rain, they will clean stuff off your windshield.  Amazing wipers.
B001D5MUVS|1|Wow. Don't expect this to work when you need it. Used 3 or 4 times. Last time pumped to 45# and it apparently burned up. The term is &#34;POS&#34;.
B00AKKK1DQ|5|Quality is A+ , Amazon ordering was smooth and A+,  Shipping was spot on time & A+ also. Fit and function satisfactory. Saa attached photo:
B006YU7G8E|4|Shipped to me fast and easy. If your going to just replace what you can suck out one bottle is enough. But if your doing the whole system your going to need two. I like the genuine parts. No difference but the old fluid had never been changed
B00KC39BE6|4|quick delivery batteries arrived charged
B00ELPTR2W|4|Sounds very good!
B000OAG2DK|5|Have not put in RV as yet. Attached it to house shower and it works great. Bought it to replace a cut off valve we bought to put on the original shower head that came in RV that quit working and corroded. We shall see as soon we take the RV out again.
B000GV2QWS|5|Looks a lot better than the stock plastic one.
B00BITLC9A|5|The part work perfect and look good just as if it was never replaced
B00F4PB8H0|5|No streaks. Works great
B000FW4LLW|5|Exactly what I needed
B003C01FD6|5|Works as expected.
B00XKTY25M|5|Great look and great fit
B000FGE7IK|3|In the course of  investigating the suitability of this filter, I had posed the question:  &#34;Will this work/fit 2006 argentina-made hilux 2.5l turbodiesel d4d 2kd- with oem level filtration for dusty patagonia?&#34;  The first response was a simple and unqualified &#34;yes.&#34;  But a little more study revealed that the &#34;yes&#34;  should really just cover the fitment question, and there is some dispute even there since K&N shows their filter number 38-9203 for this Hilux model.   Now on to the question of the reusable/cleanable K&N filter as a cost-effective solution, once we get the fitment sorted out.   We turn the attention to why this filter has a reported high flow rate (most would agree it does) and whether the pleats and surface area are really major factors.  Turns out this filter flows a lot of air because it doesn't filter the smaller crud out of the air very efficiently.  And the independent lab testing using an internationally recognised test standard  for air filters also confirmed that this filter family just doesn't keep the dirt out as well as some other (disposable) filters.   K&N seems to contend that the international standard for air cleaner media doesn't reflect real-world conditions.   But if we consider that the size and number of  particles that the K&N filter doesn't  capture very well, then other factors come into question. So when we consider an expanded life-cycle cost-benefit analysis, we insert the probabilities of the damage eventually done by higher levels of dirt getting past the filter, and the need for more frequent oil changes.  That changes the perspective considerably.  So the rating is this:  three stars means it's just OK, but not a superior choice for absolute fine-particle filtration.  If you desire enhanced engine (turbo, intake) sounds at the (potential) expense of more frequent oil/filter changes and possibly accelerated engine wear, this filter type might be what you like.  If on the other hand optimal air cleaning is more important, other filter types might be more appropriate.
B00OUTEQT8|4|The price was great, shipping was as promised, they are direct replacements for many incandescent bulbs, BUT, they just don't provide the same amount of light. Keep the original bulbs in critical areas, or find led's with higher lumen output.
B00AR2BW4Y|5|Exactly what I wanted!! And super fast shipping!!!
B00SS40XL6|5|Got this for my sister in law. Delivery was fast and she loved it! Super happy 😀
B00496F0HY|2|I purchased these wipers about 7 weeks ago and unfortunately they are on their way out. Starting out, the wiping performance was good and had little streaking or smearing, but after 3 or so weeks small gaps developed which caused each wiper to miss 3 or so small parts on it's stroke. Overall I do not recommend this product. This product has poor performance, poor longevity, and the only positive thing I can say is that it comes at a low price.
B00DCXIJJG|5|Very light and powerful. Installed it without any issues on Honda Shadow Spirit, included spacers were not needed. Starts engine right away and holds the charge exceptionally well.
B00FGLRY0M|5|Just what i wanted
B000B8YDUO|5|This is what you need to pack hundreds of needle bearings and have them stay.  I will never ever be without a bin of this stuff again.  SO happy I tried it.  I used it to rebuild 2 transfer cases and it made the tricky parts of a D300 a breeze!
B004GESL7A|5|Hundreds less than used! quality and a perfect fit
B00T1BVYS6|5|Love!!
B001EOWRHU|5|easy to install, you should not run rails in you bed without these
B004J0SR5M|5|Was as expected with no surprises
B005VJ63P6|5|great
B007V1QJKQ|5|Bought one from local supplier, second via amazon. $25 cost savings, both fit perfectly.<br />Very pleased with price and fitment of this item.
B00976L174|4|this is pretty neat. If you have a screwed up shifter knob, and don't want to spend a lot of money for a new one, THIS is your answer.....
B008L5J5G6|5|Was very easy to install and works great
B00GHT4JFA|5|looks good
B00WZ7Q6YU|5|Come in very handy if you do many oil changes
B0033ZTAOQ|5|All good
B00FTDJ9FA|5|These look awesome
B001KOHXJG|5|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B00LEBLI82|5|A must have for saving battery power. Brighter than the old bulbs
B0028R1IIG|5|wife said great!!!!
B0069ARUKI|4|Very well made and useful device, especially for the price.
B007RGYMO0|5|Actually fits very well on my XRT850. Even covers most of the tires being a raised cart. Lots of tie downs to hold it to the cart also. I was pleasantly surprised! Nice cover.
B00DMTTSIQ|2|It's custom molded and it's a &#34;mat&#34; or &#34;liner&#34; but I was expexting something a little more flexible and softer and rubbery!<br /><br />This thing is a ROCK hard, rigid piece of plastic and you couldn't bend it if you tried. Just understand that before you buy it, it's solid plastic, it looks like solid plastic, and it feels like a piece of solid plastic and even though it will protect, it's not the least bit attractive and fairly cheaply made.
B005SVVBRC|5|thanks
B00FZMVO8U|5|Authentic Ford product for F-150 pickup truck. I installed these in a different vehicle with a bit of ingenuity and re-engineering and they sound great. My original equipment was a single tone horn. The original horn eventually failed which gave me a great excuse for an upgrade to a dual tone horn.
B00026Z3DQ|4|Good heavy duty jack stands that i use when working on my superduty. Too high for a normal car but would definately recmmend if working on a pickup or a big SUV.
B00CG0IXCE|5|Great Metal Decal...looks Awesome...easy to adhere.
B000CP0KHG|5|work as descibed
B000GV6UIE|5|Works well
B002T02UA2|5|great price and quality
B005R15TDK|1|Quality dosent match the price! Do not waste your money on this item. When I received mine her body was not smooth and round but blocky and the painting done on her was terrible!
B00X7CC78Q|1|You get what you pay for bought the kit mainly for the cylinder open the box I had a cylinder ,gasket kit and a set of rings no piston how am I supposed to put my motor together with no piston
B007H2RR78|5|Very rugged better than any other hose would highly recommend for 1st time RV.
B000COB3TG|4|Bought locally.  To install, reverse hook, it goes in the U bracket to pull cable down into bracket over those two wheels. This will twist out of shape easily.  I pulled mine back into a functional shape by passing a 3/8 x 1 1/2 bolt through U with large thick stacked washers on both sides to sandwich the unit.  You will also need 1&#34;+ washers stacked on threads to pull this puppy tight.  I also crimped hook closed so large washers could better sandwich bracket.  There is no alternative to this well designed yet cheaply made product.  I looked.  A lot.  If you find something, please post.  Hope this helps...  UPDATE  my 'rig' didn't work.  Don't waste your time with this...
B00KZCH57Y|5|I ordered the side rails for my truck. I ordered the wrong kit. The supplier quickly sent me the right one and sent me a return shipping label  They were very easy to work with. I wouldn't hesitate to deal with them again.<br />When I got the right ones, I installed the kit in my garage, with hand tools. The install was very easy, and it looks great. The instructions were easy to follow and all the parts fit perfectly. The quality is top notch.
B005PZMLDY|4|These seats covers are nice! Thank You
B00N2DCP9Q|4|Good fit, arrived as described.
B004CFVZ4Y|5|Flawless transaction. Starter went on with no problem, mower fires up on first try. With the money I saved on Amazon and DB Electrical, I can afford the gas to run my mower! Shipping was the absolute fastest ever, and I mean FAST !!! Buy with confidence
B000P4SA1M|4|Very good
B003TQNAGI|5|Nice even coverage! Easy to use and weather resistant. I've used many leather spray paints and this is the best.
B00M468ZSC|2|zippers are flimsy and the pull broke on the first use
B00D1SWH5Y|5|Got them about a week ago because a couple friends used them for almost 2 years with no issues. Everything works well, including the turn signal function. The KEY to making the turn signals work well, is to find TWO separate constant 12volt power sources for each side it seems. In my car, a 2004 Crossfire, they are running very well. I left the turn signal function disconnected until I have time to run a separate 12v constant to the passenger tail light. Don't rate this poorly because you haven't put in the effort to get to to work properly. It's actually a decent product for once when it comes to LEDs.
B004X8SRLE|5|Just installed this on my 2013 automatic mustang v6 and I must say it is a must have performance accesories. The roaring sound and dramatic inmprovement in throttle response is awesome. Installation was harder than advertised, but it wasn't difficult. Everybody should buy this performance upgrade.
B00JDPRFEM|5|Very good！
B000FVDJ5M|5|nice quality
B00EZ9T62U|1|This is a very poor design kit nothing fit properly muffler inlet was incorrect even with the adaptor.The tailpipes were suppose to fit on with the spare tire in place the tire had to be removed and not put back in place.The tailpipes where it came out of muffler back to the first bend was far to long and had to be cut and reflared to make them fit.I am very disappointed with this kit it took 3 mechanics to get this exhaust to work on this truck.This kit is not a DIY kit if u don't have mechanical background do not attempt.
B003BZZ1QO|5|Works great help with heating issue.
B0002NIKMK|5|Perfect.
B001UG0ZXA|5|Order from and back and went back and orders another set for another truck. I am very please with the quality and price.
B00OB8ESPK|3|I was hoping it was going to be as sticky as Oracal 651, but it wasn't. It does stick ok to things but I wouldn't trust it to stick for very long
B0007Y6FGM|4|It was good to find a replacement lens without having to buy the whole light.
B00CE2H4OW|5|This tool is a must have if you need to remove the intake cam gear.  Solid build and long enough to get good leverage.  Keep in mind that this will only work on the intake cam and you will need the exhaust cam tool as well.
B0081ZYPLG|5|Utilitarian devise worked as described.
B00MN92QI0|5|Very good
B00NPPNKTU|4|Nice and bright. Good product for the money. Likely will purchase more for other vehicles. Installed two on my ATV for night use and plowing snow.<br />Mounting screws could be better, they are a little short and the lock washer is tiny. Also could use a couple washers to make mountimg it more secure.<br />I noticed one LED bulb had brown tinge around it and it was not aimed straight with the other bulbs. However I noticed no light color difference or light projection difference when it was lit.<br />Overall very happy with these lights.
B003CJN2QU|5|Got this kit for my 01 Kawasaki Prairie 400 that stopped running.  The spark plug was dry after attempting to start the wheeler for a while so I figured it was a carb issue.  Had never rebuilt a carb before.<br />Got the kit blew out all the passages and replaced all the parts from the kit.  After installing the carb, the Prairie fired right up.  Very happy.
B000IXLNTQ|5|I purchased this sign for my husband for his birthday (he picked it out). He mounted it in the garage on the side of his tool chest with a strong magnet. It's really funny and we both like it. It's a good quality sign.
B00239X8VY|3|The goggles fit well and are wind tight but...they do not fit over my glasses as they were supposed to.
B00M3ENQXE|5|Keys worked great.

B00336YWS4|5|Great reasonable  priced product  to replace  my oops while backing into to the garage
B00CGTVESK|5|This is the second BPA Steering Wheel cover we've purchased. (Repeat customer). I like the feel of it and its tight fit. The gray color is fairly light, and I would have preferred one slightly darker, but still, it looks nice (Toyota Sienna). Our first one was for our Ford Taurus, and it has been protecting the steering wheel for a at least a year with no problems. When installing it, it is best to start at the bottom and work your way up. The sewn seam should be at the very bottom when installed. That way the stitching around the cover with look correct after installation.
B00KCQSM84|4|Good product, could fit a but better. But they are still good
B000COCRW8|5|did the job i want
B0000CBIL8|5|They do the job.
B00Z7N71UM|5|Brush Hero arrived in the mail today, and I already used it to wash both my road bike and my cyclocross bike.  I bought it for the specific purpose, and I am very impressed.  It is very well-suited for washing bicycles, and this is a must-have for anyone who rides and cares for their bikes regularly (and especially for those who race CX).  Also, for peace of mind, I will note that I know the two gentlemen who came up with this product, and I know they will stand behind it.  This is a really good product and will make bike-cleaning chores must faster and easier, with better results.
B008AKN81K|5|Look great
B00T2R76FO|5|excelente...
B001D5E5O8|3|Didn't last long
B00HZY3L64|5|excelente...
B00F4PL2GM|3|Got a tear in the palm of one pretty quick, but it held up during a 20mph slide out around a turn. Saved my skin so that's all I care about. I'll probably purchase something different when I get new gloves though. I do like the carbon fiber look.
B004O2QX7O|4|There was no protective wrapping on the hitch so it was scratched when I received it. Other than that it was very easy to install and looks great!
B003BJNT0K|5|The are first class mirrors that were easily installed on my Polaris Sportsman 450's, nice clean crisp distortion free glass. Great product, not cheap but definitely worth the money. I highly recommend these mirrors.
B001JA6324|1|Absolutely terrible. The bags themselves are nice, but the quarter turn locking clasps are not nearly secure. I lost a bag of clothes on the highway! It's not a mounting issue, either. The left side bags are perfectly secure, but the right side lock nuts and clasps I received are defective and don't want to fully lock. I played with multiple depths of the lock nuts so the clasps would catch, which it seemed that they did, but came loose on the highway. I'm incredibly disappointed in these bags. Will never buy another Saddlemen product again.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This product worked great. I traveled roughly 400 miles with it on my Lincoln Aviator from my house to my dorm. The 8 tie downs secures it very well. I drove between 70 - 80 mph and it didn't budge, flap, or make any noise. To be honest you forget you have it while driving. It also did very little to affect my gas mileage and did not damage my roof at all. Once unloaded it cleaned up easy, folded up easy, and stored easy in my dorm. I look forward to using it again. It did not rain on my trip so I can't comment on waterproof performance, but I did pack everything in contractor bags just in case. This product seems durable so if you take care of it, this bag will last you many years.
B00069CN2I|5|Good value almost no extra vibration. 05 gmc
B00R8QGITG|5|Excellent product with VERY high quality battery clamps.
B00COYNVPQ|5|My wife is a star wars nut so she enjoyed this item a lot.  She brags about it to everyone that gets in her car.
B008DQS34S|4|Performs as stated
B010BT4XSY|1|NOT STAINLESS STEEL!!!!!!!!  The description says it is stainless, both at the top by the picture as well as in the detailed description, but it definitely is not!  I have several complaints: first, the hole for the antenna is way way way too big.  A firestik mounting stud with a fire ring connector is supposed to have a 7/16 inch hole.  This bracket is closer to 3/4 and not even round.  It looks like it was drilled by a kid that didn't know what he was doing. I had to find stainless washers to make it work.  Second, it is powder coated all over, and heavily.  Anyone with radio experience knows that your vehicle acts as a ground plane, which requires the antenna base be grounded, unless you pay big bucks for a no ground plane antenna set.  I had to use a grinder to expose the metal to get a ground, sand paper kept loading up with powder coat.  Finally is the fact that after everything else it is rusting where the powder coat was ground off, no way it is stainless.  Whoever is selling this as stainless is a liar and a thief.  They think you won't know better because of the powder coat.  Now I don't feel like I could return it because I used a grinder on it.  Ask yourself, why would it need powder coat if it was stainless?  Because it's not, that's why.  Plan on running a ground wire, but then it might as well have been plastic if you do that.
B005HAYDR4|5|all ok!
B000GV3C7Q|5|Awesome look for my 2006 CRF 250R fits as expected
B00EPYDYGE|5|Sounds great makes turbo spool fsster also whistle louder. Not much difference in fuel economy..
B00062ZHH8|5|I purchase these everytime I rebuild a mild SBC. I LOVE these rockers and have NEVER had a problem with them.Want a nice cheap upgrade with slight performance gain? These are for you!
B0043SCBD4|5|Perfect Fit. 2014 F150
B00EEKPQLK|2|Cheaply made.  You can't replace seals if they go bad.  Just replace the whole thing.
B003S1RQ2S|5|I used this to make a DIY speaker box.  Worked decently, has 7 amp hours as calculated by me.  Did not exploded or melt, so that earns a 5/5 from me.
B005ASY23I|4|Only used once but it did the job on my big 33 inch jeep tires. Got pretty hot doing 4 tires in a row.
B010OYOHO6|5|Great product all around! I love the wireless capabilities of this product! No more tangled up earbud cords! The music is crystal clear through these headphones. I haven't had a problem with static. The price is very affordable, it's not a cheap &#34;made in china&#34; product. You get your money's worth, and the customer service is outstanding!! Thanks Apollo Player! Hope to do business with you again!!
B00ZQ384UY|2|The stopping performance of these is much less than I would have expected.
B00D7H6Z9S|5|Excellent replacements for the ones I used to get.
B001AZUAQS|5|Great quality, great product. Absolutely love it.
B00062YBSY|5|Just what was needed
B00AN5UF02|5|&#34;Worth the purchase&#34; says Cleveland Brown.
B00061NR4Y|2|the scent i did not like as i though i would,and the scent is short lived.
B001G4Z69O|5|Fits great and provides security
B0080IGK1W|3|Works okay, but a bit slow.
B000ALG8CI|5|Great product perfect match
B00H2JDL8A|1|This part sucks! I Purchased this to replace the motor of the left window of my 2001 Mitsubishi eclipse. This part is very poorly made.  After installing this part we plugged in the switch to test the motor before putting back the panel. Once we press the button the center piece of this part chewed the wire of the window regulator. We ended with no motor and no regulator and the window did not roll up since the cable from the regulator in now broken. I am now going to purchase the dorman brand.
B0022XI4NS|5|Great product!!!!!! Installation was easy If you follow directions!!!! Once installed its best to let them heat up in the sun and sort of shrink to fit!!
B000E24APU|1|this product is a joke. My repair looks horrible. Duct tape and a magic marker would worked better than this!
B00005OWK2|3|Good.
B00JMRAX36|5|Great fit paint matched perfect
B00652G4TS|5|Best diagnostic scanner I've ever used!
B007KPERVG|5|this light kit worked great and looks good thanks
B002UC2Q0S|5|works as intended
B000EQR7XS|5|happy would recommend exact replacement
B00H1I639Q|5|Nice lugs, best I've used so far..
B005FXZSCW|5|I installed it and no more leaks
B0070Y36NC|5|love it
B009RC2HVC|5|Just what I needed.
B00V39Z9NA|5|Works great
B008C8O026|5|Pretty basic item, not much to go wrong here. I added a hook to the bottle side of the cable, made it easier to hang from something under the truck.
B00I1FTXI6|5|If you own a BMW it is a must you have these on your tires.
B00QQS6O1O|5|Looks great
B0060Z8ULA|4|body shop installed trim  looks good  glenn
B000O08WX8|5|works fine, didn't solve my problem though
B00GB9VR7Y|5|Great for the price.
B00WPW6BAE|5|I used this on a 2014 Honda Odyssey and a 2007 Range Rover.<br />Synced it up with Dash Command app ($9.99) on my iPhone 5 with no problems.<br />Revealed the code for the CEL on the Honda.<br />No complaints.<br />I researched an OBDII Can device extensively.  I was looking at the PLX Kiwi 2 and the Ultra-Gauge initially, but for the price and my usage this was worth a shot.  Worked wellwith no problems.<br /><br />Update:  On the Honda Odyssey, to clear codes in Dash Command, the minivan had to be on in the accessory mode, not with the engine running.  Since I have a push button start, that meant pushing the start button without depressing the brake to put in &#34;accessory&#34; mode.
B00863M98Y|5|Fit Freat no problems
B00CC2ZUP4|5|I got shipping free from opt7. Then they pay for it to be priority 2 day shipping at no cost to you. It came from California to Ohio in 2 days. They helped answer car specific questions I had during installation. Heres where its tricky. 1 ballast didnt work. I emailed them a bit fustrated because I now had put 1 old bulb back in. Also, I ttouched the new hid bulb a few times when trying to take it back out of my car(which your not supposed to do). I emailed them a bit mad. By the time they responded, maybe an hour through email, they already had a new ballast in the mail to me along with a new bulb. They said not to worry about sending the old one back. They always respind quickly and they are very nice. The one bulb that us installed is amazing in quality. I have h11 , 55w, 8000k xenon for 2013 buick verano.
B003GXMJG6|2|quality is poor
B00HRJQ69G|5|I love it !!!
B00BC26KR2|5|Thank you , Thank you, Sweet.
B00WIYY93U|5|perfect fit on scrambler fast shipping
B00HUME0WK|5|Best fitting sunshade for any car hands down. This is my second and worth every penny. Does the job, fits perfect.
B00KSUA6HY|4|Lights are very bright. For a 2005 ford f150 however, the sockets provided do not fit into the cluster. You have to remove the old bulb out of the original ford socket and put in one of the LED bulbs. Other than that, they worked perfectly.
B00GE9Y5ZC|5|Fit on the front of my 2015 Silverado crew cab perfectly. They are a breeze to install and went on in about 5 minutes. There is no drilling required. You remove 4 star head screws from each side of the truck using the included star head bit, and screw them on using the same screws you removed. You do have to have a 1/4 inch ratchet and a socket that fits the star head bit. You do not have to remove your tires, just turn the wheels to the side and there is plenty of room to install them. The holes line up perfectly and they go right on in minutes. They look sharp, and will provide adequate protection. I now have these on the front and rear, and they really look good on my truck. I recommend these mud flaps.
B000CMJ3G8|1|The Acorn Bulge seat nuts are not nearly as bulged as much as the original lug nuts. They do tend to chip and rust even more when the air tools are used. I would highly recommend Anti-Seize from  permetext on both the flared end of the nut and the concave hole for the suds in your wheels. Otherwise you risk digging the Aluminum part around the studs. Being a solid, the nuts it beat the O.E. Swelling up and not being able to fit the tool over the nut to change a tire. Time for a new rim because the bulge is way too small. Should not be listed for this car.
B00YZR7NPE|3|Not very bright
B00SXGIGJ0|5|Pleased with this jacket. Great weight for summer rides. Well engineered; neat details like mini-zips for liner cuffs. Using quality materials. Shortness reduces feeling of bulkiness. I always attach to pants with rear zip. When using the waterproof liner with rain covers over my mesh pants, I make sure to pull the cover's waist well up to compensate for the shorter jacket. Otherwise, driven water enters at your waist!
B00NHDPCLY|2|It is not like the original  the original has 3 positions on of and reserve this one only works if to on position is in off and the reverse is on it also faces in the wrong direction .  But I made it work.  9 dollar part 35 dollar shiping . And 2weeks later they offer free shipping .NOT TO GOOD.
B00386UI82|3|This kit adds nice stability to the rear of my truck. Beware that the provided bracket bolt holes are too wide for the stock bolts on my 2001 4Runner and need a washer adding.
B004FSEJZA|5|Excellent cleaner and polish. Works well on my 2014 Honda Valkyrie.
B002JH4GMK|2|Slow shipping and improper colors. 6 bears, and theyre dancing when they should be marching. Not the same as picture!!!
B00UZYH05O|5|Delivery was fast & it was as expected for a great price.
B00UG2QYSY|5|Sadly, I put this on after my car door edge had been scraped against a wall in a parking structure. But it was super-easy to put on and really does the protect the door against walls like that. And it is really hardly noticeable unless you look closely.
B00E0FRZHC|5|I was in an accident a couple months ago, recovering nicely, but this jacket really took the hits on my right shoulder and elbow. The jacket resisted abrasion from the road, some minor bruising but it definitely could have been a lot worse. Recommendation: buy some protection for your knees, because my right knee was not so lucky.  It may not fit as nicely as a dainese jacket, but i honestly think that it provides about the same amount of elbow and shoulder protection. I've tried on other motorcycle jackets at cyclegear, but none of the same priced jackets seem to provide the same level of protection on their elbow and shoulder pads as this jacket does.  Look wise, when you put it on you look like you have broad shoulders. And there is space in the chest area and tummy area so i wish it was a little snugger, but that space could be used to insert a back protector as well as a kidney belt.  But you definitely feel protected.
B00AYRR0O8|5|Very good
B00N6D7K38|2|Not as bright as competing led bulbs, color is good just needs to be brighter
B000COVJ4K|4|Works good. Strong so far. Good take off. Fixed the hesitation problem. So far so good.
B0002LBGX2|5|easy to use great results
B006H824U8|3|Decent
B0002U1TZS|5|It really works
B0093XLGVM|1|No doubt this is the worst item I purchased on Amazon, just give a dim light and do not work well ... say that throwing money to buy this article is little
B003YI421I|4|Delivery,packaging was great. I used it on small item. Too soon to tell if its what I hoped for. As of now I am very pleased.
B000C9PKEA|5|What you see is what you get!  Great parts at the best price I could find with super fast shipping!
B012Y0BHXC|5|When I purchased this product I was thinking to use it for my car however when I received it I noticed it is a bit big so we used it for our truck . It still covers the car but it fits perfect on the truck. I am happy I purchased this product at a discount price in return for my honest review. If I didn't have a truck I would still use it for my car .
B00DKO4P5O|5|Funnel works perfectly for my laquer thinner waste into a 35 gallon drum
B0014B86R8|5|Perfect fit.  Great price
B003CJEJWG|3|This was a great part but it turned out to look kind of clunky on my bike. The fit was really good though.
B00PG5X7AY|1|The carpets did not fit correctly for my Lexus IS 350. Disappointed
B008L4S8NI|4|These work, but I had to add a zip tie to keep them from rotating with a heavy steel coffee cup.
B0069CPO2M|5|Don't need to worry about droping
B000NWA8M0|5|Part was easy to install and worked like expected.
B00537FIRU|1|I recived it without screws!! Im unable to install ?
B001PNCLIA|5|Just the part that I needed.  It came complete, fit perfectly and improved the performance of my Ram Van.
B00823FSRC|3|My Kayak has too much of a V underneath so it has to sit on its side on the cart. Secondly, the straps that comes with this cart is crap. They don't hold tightly and when walking with the kayak, the cart ends up sliding off due to poor straps. I will keep it for now but recommend buying better straps
B004K850H6|3|It works
B002NSFTA8|5|Dans les délais prévu
B00ZYWPPYK|3|Take the plug apart and flip the wiring now that hard did it to mine!
B0001L0DFA|5|You will know as soon as you take it out of the packaging that it is all about quality. No leaks, not drips. don't buy one buy two.
B0086ZNB4S|3|With a single flaw, these are the best belt devices I have tried. That flaw is the plastic pins used for the securing panel on the back. If one of those hinge pins breaks (as plastic does) the entire clip is useless. Amazon page indicates: &#34;Warranty, Parts: Parts&#34; but  no time limit or more information about the seller's warranty. Disappointing. Otherwise these are easy to install, work well and are more presentable than most similar products.
B000FP0A82|5|good  boat will move easily  in driveway now
B009J3L4RM|5|Installed these in both my 2010 Jeep JKU and 1995 Ford F250.  These are an excellent reverse light upgrade in both my vehicles.
B00WFHYZE8|1|I have had this product on my 2015 Genises Sedan for two full weeks now and have not seen a gain in mpg or power. Starting to think I paid for an empty black box that clips on my map sensor!
B00MVQPPFQ|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Probably the best thing to ever buy for your bike. $350 will save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. Never worry about your performance again...
B000RG30CM|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B00E80ZG9S|5|Awesome exactly what I wanted and got to me fast
B0049CGJAU|5|Fit perfect. Makes it look like a professional installed the hitch
B00ONHNXCS|5|Almost perfect. Not as rugged as the original OEM. Showed up quick and fast. Also not bad the cost.
B009PCR67Y|5|Fits perfect. Clear view and easy to use.
B003SKCARK|5|YEP
B005IWQM0C|5|My husband wouldnt use anything else
B001C9U1IE|5|If  you enter your vehicle information with Amazon, the product guide says this filter DOES NOT fit a 2007 Dodge Ram 2500 Cummins Diesel pickup. I researched the Wix site and it in fact DOES fit. I ordered one and it fits exactly, just like the one I bought from the local Dodge dealer for over $40.00.
B00IYZ3V5Y|1|This stuff is horrible. Painted my repair black instead of silver even though I shook it very well.
B004ME11FS|4|Should but the longer one but this one will work just need to buy 2. As some water connections are not close enough with one as a back up.
B005JUOG9W|5|Solid high quality
B00OMT6UEK|5|This has helped me so many times. It is a valuable tool if you work on cars.
B00029J276|5|Great tint!! Where can I find more of this type?
B0002Z2MZ4|5|I'll be really honest, I've always used windex or a slightly damp paper towel to clean the dash and interior of my cars over the years.  I'm not a detailer, and I've never much cared for spending gobs of money on 'specialty' products to clean my car.  I wash it, I vacuum it and I drive it.  This changed a few months ago when I got an S4 and realized I really like when it's clean, and it's unlike any other car I've had.<br /><br />In doing research I came across Matt's YouTube channel and then his website, obsessedgarage.com, where he has a very unbiased an honest review of the products he uses to clean his cars.  Cockpit was his suggestion for interior and I honestly couldn't be happier I bought it.<br /><br />I used a clean / new microfiber towel and applied Cockpit directly to it, and it was a little rough to wipe things down, I'm thinking a different weave of towel might be better?  But wow, not only did it remove the light dust that was on the top but it got dirt and grime out that I had no idea existed in the 2 months of owning the car.  The dash pad, door and center console are all different materials, Cockpit cleaned it all really well and left a super matte / new car look to things.  I'm past the days of super shiny tires and Armor All glistening dashes, I just want an upscale, professional look and Cockpit provides this
B00NI8XC06|1|It was not shaped to the contour of the light and after 45 minutes of trying to get it to work. We gave up and threw them away.
B00QGXSODA|5|My husband loved it!
B000E5U3ZI|5|Awesome! Did increase HP.
B000I8YPQ4|5|This little pad packs a punch.  Measured after being on &#60;10 minutes with a Fluke 62 Mini at an average temp in the 370s.  I was going to use this to defrost a freezer, but this would melt right through the plastic.  I decided to fasten it to a large metal heat sink in order to dissipate the heat and that worked great.  It would have been helpful to have an accurate temperature range in the item's description before purchasing (I would not have bought this) so I posted a picture of my Fluke reading to help others.
B0016N7OTA|4|Does the job but if you have a plate with writing on very bottom , it will get covered a little.  Otherwise it's sharp and clean looking.  I like it
B00RW7WYNU|5|It was what I order It fit perfect on my Kia very satisfied
B001NJ3H0C|5|Works just fine; easy replacement
B00DTU95Y0|5|Just like it was described
B000CEE62W|5|Good, as expected
B0006IX7V0|5|Held through several forty mile hour wind storms.
B00064LQKS|5|Works
B0009VY71I|5|Worked as promised
B001J8PYHG|5|GREAT
B0007V9XAU|5|Fits perfect. Fits under the bumper. Does not sit pass. Easy to install. Did it by myself in 20 minutes.
B00OK8VVR4|5|Worked beautifully, Very easy to use. Watched  a video with instructions and came out perfect and I am an 80 year old womwn111
B000C9JXBG|5|Excellent equipment
B00HVHVLDU|5|Works great.
B008ROAZH4|5|Just what I needed for household and garage wiring projects.
B000CSIS54|4|A
B0066CP6I2|1|I do not use this fan, because it can't be clipped where it would be beneficial to the driver.<br />I am dissapointed with this fan.
B00UUAYBU0|5|Perfect size and very sturdy. Not cheap feeling and they seem they will really last. Very happy with these! They hook onto the pocket on the back of my seats and are perfect for the kids to put trash into, I easily empty them every time I get gas.
