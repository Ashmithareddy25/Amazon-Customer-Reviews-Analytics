B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an excellent series about WW2 concentrating on America's first paratroopers.  Shipping was speedy.  No complaints at all.
B00005A1VH|5.0|I love this movie and my family including my 13 year old daugher loves it!!  We even quote from the movie, what an awesome Tennessee hero!!  If you are ever around Tennessee, visit his home and town in Pall Mall.  We have had the priviledge of visiting.  My dad even went to school with his grandson!!  great history lesson.
0446579939|5.0|The characters are great and the style is new compared to his other novels. Let me just start off by saying that I truly love his style of writing and it is a pleasure to read his books, if you have not read any of Sparks novels. Start today and read them all. At the end of you life you can look back at the novels by Sparks and be happy to know that your time was well spent. I am not going to tell you anything about the book, just read and savor it like a fine, well aged wine.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I liked this movie and Jamie Lee is great.  I do not prefer it over the old version of the movie but my teenage daughter does of course!!  There are some similarities to the old movie but not many. It is funny and pretty clean.
0956010903|5.0|Having bought my Collector's Edition book since a long time ago, I had forgotten a little bit about it but the moment I saw my amazon package delivered at my door, I couldn't control myself and opened it right away. Thankfully, the package I opened and the book inside of it I bought was worth every second from the past months. Having grown with the Harry Potter books and become a huge fan, this kind of things make me so happy and the quality of this book is simply amazing.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he was very impressed. Great film for a history buff.
B0017JKEL8|4.0|I can hardly wait for season two to come out; overall great show. However, the ending in this season kind of fizzles out.
B000WC39SG|4.0|Still the best made war movie of all time, just not an allied victory so it never got its' due.  The Bluray version has better sound quality than the conventional one, but the picture isn't vastly improved so you can live without the Bluray if need be.
0956010903|4.0|I had to wait a little longer than everyone else for my CE copy, but it was well worth the wait. The packaging kept the contents nice and snug. I've heard some complaints about some of the metal decorations being off but mine were pretty flawless and only a few were slightly tilted, but nothing too serious. The only thing that irked me about this was that there were a few misspellings (Tnd instead of And when it should clearly be the latter). Is it just me or did I pay quite a considerable amount less for 'Deathly Hallows' that had near to no misspellings? Though it's the most trivial thing and not the end of the world unless you're planning on keeping it in mint condition (and if you are you would never discover this problem in the first place!). Also one side of the 'case' has some slight imperfections, but again not that big of a deal as it's what's inside that really counts. Overall none of these tiny problems really matter when you look at where some of the proceeds are going.
0345495004|5.0|An incredible story of an icon in American architecture.  Reading this has not only given me perspective into the age of Frank Lloyd Wright, but has made me passioante about seeing his work & studio firsthand!  Our book club read this selection, and we all enjoyed a great discussion of the issues the book brought up.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GKJ2DO Mamma Mia! The Movie (Two Disc Special Edition)]] is an uplifting celebration of life, love and friendship -- plus the complications of such.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is phenomenal in her role as the single mother who runs a hotel on a Greek island.  This movie is worth seeing just for the beautiful scenes of the islands...But the performances of Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski turns this into a fabulous song fest.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are hilarious as contenders for \\"father\\", along with Stellan Skarsgard.<br /><br />While the story may seem trite -- love wins out, etc. -- the gorgeous ABBA tunes sweep across the beautiful settings, creating a crescendo of glory as the characters bask in the beauty of life and nature.

1582701709|5.0|My business associates kept referring to reading from The Secret to enhance their personal development. What is the secret? I kept wondering so I went to Amazon and ordered the book.  It arrived a few days later and I have read from it daily since its arrival.  I am now learning about the secret and how to apply it to my own life.  There is so much philosophy written on each page that I don't want to read too much at one sitting because I want to think about each of the ideas presented before going to the next, yet it is so captivating that I don't want to put it down.  I am thankful and grateful to have this book which is already making a difference in my life. I know that I will start the book from the beginning again when I reach the end and I think that I will continue that cycle for the rest of my life.  Don't hesitate to add it to your own collection.         Diane Nelson   Math teacher, retired
1433502402|5.0|The ESV is easy to use but very comprehensive. The color graphics and full page print make it easy to follow in a group setting. I LOVE the free online resource that comes with the Bible--easy to navigate and type your own notes. This will be my primary study Bible from now on.     The Bible is also great for beginners as it gives historical and controversial commentary to answer the more difficult questions about the Word. Love it!!!!!
B00005V0X5|1.0|This was a BIG disappointment. I have the cassette version and I have been trying to locate a CD for a very long time so I can have it for my collection. I was GREATLY disappointed when my favorite song \\"These Boots\\" was almost in its entirety \\"beeped\\" out. I certainly did NOT receive the CD which is advertised on Amazon's website, \\"Parental Advisory\\" and \\"Explicit Lyrics\\". And lastly, certainly not the \\"Original Record Completely Remixed\\". This is a very misrepresented product and ruined the originality of the music.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it.  I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was a junior in high school back in 1996. This is by far the best vampire movie I have ever viewed.  Just watching this movie brings back good memories.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|My son absolutely loves this movie.  Blur-Ray is amazing and it is like we are back in the theatres.
B000N3AXQU|5.0|This is an awesome movie that makes you realize that anything is possible as long as you have hope.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Pixar continues to push the envelope in terms of animation technology, and additionally serves up what is probably one of the best movies of the year in terms of characters, warmth, and social conscience.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  You should definitely watch it, and the HD version is mindblowing.  All the \\"making of\\" extras are also pretty good and reveal all the attention to detail that continues to make every Pixar movie a hit.
0743270754|4.0|This book is great! It is one of the few books that Obama has read reciently and one that is seeming to affect Obama's views. Very detailed and explores the thinkers, feelings, and political dealings for one of the most facinating administrations in American History. Obama is wise to pick up this book and you would too. However, it is very long so be careful! Other than that, it is a great book to read to understand Lincoln in his upcoming 200th year and one of the books that is affecting the new administration. Its history in the making!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch is here to stay. Their name says it all. From the pulse throbbing opener \\"Ashes\\" to the more melodic \\"The Bleeding\\", this album has it all. \\"Salvation\\" \\"White Knuckles\\" and \\"Can't Heal You\\" start off with a riff that kicks you in the face and doesn't stop kicking until the last chord is struck at the end of the song. Another stand out is \\"Death Before Dishonor\\". It yet again pounds you into the ground with the heavy verse, but pulls you back up with its melodic chorus. This album is one for all metal fans. This band is living up to its name, and they are definitely here to stay.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The finest TV Series since Route 66.  Every episode is brillantly written and directed with such style.  There is not a bad performance in the whole 7 season series.
B000063V8R|5.0|I'm a Star Trek fan, and for me this season of The Next Generation is as good as Star Trek gets.  It's consistently smart and entertaining.  Every episode gives you something to think about.  I'd recommend it.
1594201927|5.0|Never has it been more important to understand the history of finance than nowadays, and fortunately we have this clearly written and fascinating but scholarly work by Niall Ferguson.  In common with most of the world, it seems, I've been confused and frightened by the events of the last few months.  I understood some of what was going on, but little about the underlying causes and histories.  All I knew was that my house and my portfolio are now worth substantially less than they had been.<br /><br />Niall Ferguson does a good job of clearing up much of my confusion.  He's a lively writer with a keen eye for an entertaining and enlightening anecdote.  In The Ascent of Money he explains the background history of stock exchanges, the bond market, and the all too important mortgage industry.  Those who have read other works by Ferguson know some of his underlying themes (such as the positive effects of European imperialism on the exploited areas) carry over from one book to another, and The Ascent of Money is no exception. But such counterintuitive ideas are intriguing, and need not be accepted by his readers if they find them wanting.<br /><br />I can't say I now understand the current financial crisis completely, but after reading The Ascent of Money I do have a better idea of some of the underlying causes and more realistic (i.e. less optimistic) expectations for how and when we might start to see some improvement.
1400067936|5.0|This book, combined with the authors BLACK SWAN, present a different prospective of the roll of chance in life. The black swans are things that happen that no one would expect given past data and probability based on commonly used statistics.  They tend to creat terrible damage, as for example the current financial market meltdown.  It is interesting to consider what a black swan of climate change might be.  The book is well written and explains somewhat complicated ideas well.  Strongly recommended!

B001NVIZ9I|4.0|Older and cheesey so far as effects go, still absolutely THE best Robin Hood running. The remakes don't hold a candle to it for all their special effects.<br />I got turned onto this by my mom and laughed at her, til I actually watched it.<br />This man WAS Robin hood..  Buy it..  you won't regret it for a second.
B001KVZ6BG|4.0|Jamal (Dev Patel) is a poverty stricken chai boy who gets the opportunity to appear on India' s version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\". The film follows his attempt to win rupees while flashing back to scenes from his childhood. Jamal is uneducated but knows the answers because of lessons learned the hard way on the streets of Mumbai. He and his more ruthless brother, Samil, were left as orphans after their mother was killed by anti-Muslim rioters. They are soon joined by a sweet orphan girl named Latika (Freida Pinto). But after Latika and he become separated Jamal devotes himself to finding her.    This is an energetic, fast paced movie sure to be a crowd pleaser, with its fairy tale story of a downtrodden underdog who refuses to give in. It's also realistic in its depiction of the horrific poverty that still exists in India despite the country's new high rise towers and other signs of economic development. But the movie also draws from the Bollywood tradition of melodrama, star crossed lovers and impossible circumstances. In other words, you shouldn't try to think too hard because some things don't make sense. Better just to go with the emotionally stirring flow and enjoy this thrill ride for what it is.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This film more or less says it all regarding the reason The Empire is collapsing like the Brokerage House of Cards that it is.  We need more people like The Dude to \\"taker 'er easy for us sinners.\\"
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|Oh my god.I'd rather sit at the dentist & have my teeth pulled without novacaine rather than sit thru that snoozer again. So So boring.No reason to stay awake thru that.
B001CDLATE|4.0|GREAT movie and it looks beautiful on Blu-Ray, but it needs more extras. Still well worth it for the movie alone.
B001K98MFK|1.0|Hmmm, a GITS video due to be released in January '09, but labeled as 2004....this seems fishy.  Don't buy.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is something that can only be expressed visually, because in writing it sounds like a bad version of the DC Universe. Read it cover to cover, and it might just change your view on many topics. There isn't anything that it doesn't touch on, ranging from general politics to rape. The movie may or may not be good, but Watchmen is something to be treasured forever. My friends and I can't stop talking about it, and it will make ten times more sense if you read it twice. The characters are perfect symbols of every aspect of society. The symbolism is off the charts. If this still doesn't sound good to you, I guess nothing will.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I got a blu-ray version \\"The Dark Knight\\"  sound is good , but picture quality is not bad  almost even that standard DVD I think  That's disappointed    and this Bluray's most of the problem is mixed IMAX film  Because , there's aspect ratio will changing in sometime  I been annoying while I watching  This is not really movie  I don't like this  What does Christopher Nolan thinking ?    If standard DVD is not including IMAX  I have to buy it again
B000V8I2QU|2.0|\\"Magic\\" is not one of my favorite Springsteen sets.  I waited for a year for the price to come down and am glad I bought a used budget copy.  My failure to connect with this set is because the songs blend together for me.  My favorite track is \\"Living in the Future\\" with a great rocking sound that E-Street blows out the roof.  Springsteen's vocals on the track are committed, \\"My faith's been torn asunder, tell me is that rollin' thunder or just the sinkin' sound of somethin' righteous goin' under?\\"  However, the song sounds much better to me in a playlist rotation with other artists rather than in the context of \\"Magic.\\"  The opening track \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is also good with its booming throbbing, \\"Bouncing off a satellite, crushin' the last lone American night.\\"  \\"Your Own Worst Enemy,\\" \\"Gypsy Biker,\\" & \\"I'll Work for Your Love\\" sound like replays of better Springsteen songs from the past.  Perhaps Bruce's new \\"Dreams\\" CD will be better!  Taxi!
B001EIOOV8|5.0|This is a great Blu title from the guys at Universal!!! Awesome picture and sound!!! Nice extras too!!! One of Scorcese's best!!! Very Recommended(Also recommended,American Gangster Blu Ray from the folks at Universal)!!! A+
B001H5X7KC|4.0|This movie pokes fun at some classic scenes in war movies such as Platoon. It has a lot of comic relief, however, may not be appreciated by those dedicated Americans who served and endured the horrors and hardships of war. Overall, entertaining if you keep it in the perspective of satire and not a slap at our brave warriors.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|Even this is a remake of a great novel with some modern adaptations, the story flowed fairly well without any major senseless plot changes that are so prevalent in so many current movies just to get an exciting chase or fight scene in the movie.   The quality of the images are great with and without the 3d fature on.  My only peeve is that it requires the enclosed green and red glasses instead of the common red and blue glasses, so only 4 people can see it in 3D. The nice red and blue glasses we bought for 3D movies so more people can watch 3D movies at one time were useless with this movie.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Went to see this only because a friend desperately wanted to see it.  I must say that this must go down as the biggest waste of a multi-million dollar film budget ever.  This is beyond toilet humour, it's more like outhouse humour.  Classic films like Young Frankenstein and Airplane! are comedic gems, this is the new below the belt idiocy of Hollywood catering to audiences conditioned to accept and shell out for just about any garbage.  Critics will point to the internet and dvd sales as to why theater attendance has declined in recent years, it would be better to blame the endless slate of horror film remakes, sequels and tripe like Tropic Thunder.  After walking out of this crapfest I must admit to having no interest in returning to the theater and have not since.  A huge waste of approximately forty five minutes of my life that I'll never have back again.  Maybe Eastwood with his output of quality films like The Changeling and Gran Torino will redeem the film industry and restore some class to it.
B000LXKLHI|5.0|I'm not a great fan of David Bowie's actually.  I very much like certain tracks, but not every single Album.  My partner, however, IS a great fan and I bought this for him.  He thinks it's fantastic, and has it in his car to play whenever he drives on his own.  So, the review is for him, really. We're slowly replacing our old LP's, and this was one of the first on his \\"have to have\\" list.  He's over the moon about it, so I would say it's a roaring success.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|A reflection on life in a reckless western village with enough modern elements to keep us anticipating every turn in the plot.  The shots through the authentic looking wavy glass were cinematic brilliance.  The quiet confidence of Cole the lawman mixed with his confusion over the \\"fairer\\" sex added extra enchantment.  Viggo's choice pose in the conflagration near the end is ever so unique and memorable.  This is a wonderful chunk of western believability and I'm proud to rate it in my Top 10!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Absolutely fantastic, Donna is the best companion yet. She isn't in awe of the doctor, nor is she secretly in love with him, in fact she carries her own as his equal. The adventures are great, everything from Pompeii, to the Doctor's Daughter (you see it coming don't you) to Agatha Cristie and I am looking forward to the 5th season - it can only get better.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|All the matrix movies and animation are together. I like the compact cases for the individual blu-ray disks, but don't like the outer box, which is weak and already broken.
0316017922|4.0|I had been eagerly looking forward to this book since summer, after catching a brief presentation by Malcolm Gladwell on the New Yorker website, and I was not disappointed.     Besides being an excellent writer, Malcolm Gladwell is insightful and gifted in \\"connecting the dots\\" behind common perceptions and the realities behind them.  This book is an encouragement to anyone who feels limited by their own perceptions of personal ability.    It's a very fun read that will cause you to think.    Thomas A. Coss
B000Q67876|5.0|I'm not going to comment on the movie itself because everyone already knows how great that is. My review is on the quality of the Blu-ray release. The picture quality is virtually flawless. They took a 14-year-old movie and made it look brand new. It's actually good enough to use if you're showing off your new flat-screen TV. I can't really comment on the sound quality because I don't have a big fancy sound system (yet), but the sound from my TV is pretty good as far as TVs go, and this one sounds pretty good. If you have Blu-ray and like this movie at all, this disc is a must-own.
B00140GXPG|5.0|You know what guys?  I wanna start this review a little differently than my other reviews here on amazon.  I wanna talk about what it IS that makes me love Van Der Graaf Generator so much.    There's something extremely interesting, complex, and downright creepy about the atmosphere this band had going back in the 70's.  Ever have those dreams where everything was VERY quiet, and you weren't sure why?  The kind of dreams where you believe you could hear a pin drop.      Well, that kind of sums up why I love Van Der Graaf Generator as much as I do.  Despite these chaotic saxophone jams, drums, and occasional electric guitar solos blazing through the songs at lightning speed, and despite the lead singers frequent habit of jumping around all the time from mellow to OUT of control-  it's usually the quiet, moody parts that feature organs and keyboards that keep my attention.    Ever since I heard that lighthouse song from Pawn Hearts, this band has been almost haunting me ever since.  I keep having these unusual images of walking along a lighthouse late at night and everything around me is extremely quiet.  I can't hear anything, even the sound of my footsteps.  Perhaps because I've heard so many stories about ghosts haunting lighthouses, such as lights going on and off (such as the stories you hear about people spotting these lights from a distance) and this is making me connect to the band and feel some kind of spiritual energy deep inside the music.  I don't know.       Or maybe just because I love video games, and my very first 3D experience was with an old PS1 game called Silent Hill with the famous lighthouse scene, and the game reminds me of this bands moody, chaotic music.  You know, the game was mostly extremely quiet and built tension as part of the gameplay, until you came across some HUGE freakin' monster, and that changed the game and gave it a more dangerous feel.  Maybe I'm thinking about Silent Hill while I play Van Der Graaf Generator albums, I don't know.    But there is something absolutely FANTASTIC going on here, and Godbluff is probably the bands best album, or second best (hey, Pawn Hearts IS incredible you know!)    \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" is PERFECT for a Stephen King movie!  At least, the spooky moody part in the beginning fits in perfectly with any one of his movies.  REALLY melodic song too.  \\"The Undercover Man\\" always gave me the vibe of the lead singer trying to sympathize with me.  I love his ability to switch between heavy, uncontrollable rock directly to light, emotional moments.  Very very good singer.     I can't remember which song is absolutely INSANE and jumps all OVER the place, but it's either \\"Arrow\\" or \\"Scorched Earth\\".  I remember listening to one of these songs and thinking \\"MAN, this is just off the hook!\\"      So YES, Van Der Graaf Generator is a brilliant progressive rock band that focuses on lyrics and atmosphere.  These guys are really good at what they do- you just have to give the lead singer a chance to grow on you, because I can guarantee he WILL win you over in the long run.
031606792X|5.0|I began to read  Twilight after I heard some moms at my daughter's school say how good this series of books are. I am alway looking for something new and good to read, so I thought I would give them a try, and I am so glad that I did.  As soon as I was done reading the first I could not wait to read the rest.  All of the books are great, but the fourth, Breaking Dawn, is AWSOME!!  I can't imagine why anyone would not like these books.  The books show us how many ways we can love different people in our lives, from our parents to our best friends, and our true loves. Open your heart and dive into this truely amazing series of books.  ( I sure hope that there will be a 5th book!!)
B001EOQWFI|5.0|At first when I saw the preview for this movie I thought it looked dumb, but my friend was able to get me into the theatre for it. I'm so glad she did because it was so worth seeing on the big screen. This movie is great! Pixar movies aren't only for kids (as you probably know), but definitely adults too! I very much recommend this movie to everyone, especially pixar movie lovers!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I love this movie.  Well writen, directed and acted.  The special features disc has a lot of great stuff on it but i was sad to see there were no deleted scenes.  The digital copy is a great extra bonus.  I saw it on my honeymoon and talked my husband into getting it as an early Christmas present.  I watch it almost daily.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|The riffs and vocal melodies are very cool and make every song memorable. They blend together metal with regular rock and even a little punk and they play their instruments very well. The singer is very dynamic and can do a lot with his voice, as he does most of the screaming and all of the singing. This is serious music unlike a lot of the popular music today, plus they can play live. They are extremely catchy without changing their sound to do so and are arguably the best British/Welsh band today. Buy this or at least the regular music only version and you will be impressed I promise.
0060245867|4.0|I bought this book because I am designing the costumes for a play with a mouse in it and this little face is precious.  My own grandchildren are beyond the age where this book would be read to them, but it fits perfectly in my collection of children's books.  Any Mom or Dad with a small child should pick up this series of stories.  They are classic and delightful.  The illustrations are wonderful.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is a great old time movie---it is right up there with its a Wonderful Life, Come to the Stables, etc.  They don't make movies like this anymore.
B000OVLBHG|4.0|For the Starship Troopers movie series, this is the best of them.  This is a great action film, though do not look for any quality acting.  This is an enjoyment only type movie.
B001JL2V1K|5.0|Ignore anything you have read about the standard DVD, The Blu-ray edition is superb. 1.78:1 widescreen using the MPEG-4 AVC is nearly perfect. DTS-HD Master Audio lossless track can not be beat. Not one bad performance.
B001CDLATE|2.0|No, it was not, what I expected. I am familiar with the theatrical 70 mm release print, I had a chance to watch the Sony Corporation 4 k scan on their flagship SRX projector, which looked absolutely gorgeous.  But to say, this disk sucks. An 8 k scan, softened, and then resharpened to make the HDCAM 1080p format look nice on a flat screen TV? No, this is not, what I call a reference disk. Any Iron Man, any Madagascar, any Pixar or simply any modern motion picture created in 2k digital workflow looks better, than this.  And, they totally blew the soundtrack!  Originally released in Masgnetic 70 mm Noise reduction 2 format, this film was always a problem case for Dolby equipped theatres, specificly, if they were THX certified. There was so much infrasonic on the track, which always overmodulated the playback chain.   With the disk, they took it over the top. They equalized for home (small() speakers, with a system, which has high pass filtering (lo cut to protect) built in, added some pseudo bass, and then did not filter off the subsonics. Result: My 1900 W ch sub amps into clipping 40\\" of brick walls shaking. No, this disk: Stay away. Do not buy.  If you're looking for really nice reference materials: Buy a recent Pixar / Disney blue ray. They do show how nice projected home theatre can be.  I have to admit: I do not use a standard home set. My picture is 24 ft wide, projected thru a recent 2k projector. The sound system matches that, of the best theatres, so there is more to hear, than at home. But if something is rated as reference, it must actually withstand the reference playback test.
0143038419|1.0|The author has gone through a difficult divorce, is breaking up with a rebound boyfriend and decides to solve her depression by taking  a year off to travel to Italy, India and Bali; the 3 sections of the book which each have 36 sections.<br /> It was an entertaining  read although there were some over the top similes and metaphors. The author strained to make enough sections in the Italy section to fit her  format.<br />  In Italy she pursues a course of ritual self-indulgence. Pizza, drinking etc.. The over the top similes are fitting her over the top indulgence, example \\" ; everybody's fresh washed undershirts and brassieres flapping in the wind like Tibetan prayer flags.\\" Or sausages.... are stuffed like ladies' legs in provocative stockings.....\\"Lusty buttocks of ham...\\"<br />As we follow Liz to India it takes her  \\"hours and hours out of the city of Mumbai\\" by taxi to reach the ashram. (Her plane landed at 1:30 a.m., she got her baggage and arrived at the ashram at 3:30 a.m.). She  proceeds to describe yogic practice for us. She describes Hatha Yoga as a practice to prepare one for meditation. This is partially true, Hatha Yoga can be used as a preparation for meditation . Hatha Yoga is  yoga of the body, a practice unto itself as noted in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita [[ASIN:8185787387 Hatha Yoga Pradipika]]keywords=hatha+yoga+pradipika&sprefix=hatha+Yoga+Prad<br />\\"She also states yoga is about disentangling the built in glitches of the human condition...\\"  What Yoga says is that there are no \\"built in glitches\\" the glitches are due to conditioning of our consciousness ( Mind) and the job of all forms of yoga is to return  us to our true nature or our own True Self. (Svarupa skt.) We are a product of the things we have learned. We are fully capable of learning to lie or to tell the truth. Our behavior is a result of all the habits of thought we have consciously or unconsciously developed.<br />As she teaches us about various aspects of yoga and meditation, more inaccuracies pour forth. Such as stating that Indians all grew up with the \\"Guru Principle\\" and expect to have a guru. First the Guru Principle means that the real Guru is one's own true Self. Secondly her experience of India appears to be limited to this one ashram. In modern India a great number of Indians are unobservant and a large number of Indians don't have guru's as they feel too many of them are corrupt. There are many many ashrams and temples  in India with many diverse school of yoga  and manners of worship not to mention an enormous variety of yogic schools of thought just as there are many flavors of Christianity. She tells us in the Bali section the Hindus don't believe in hell.

Other Indian scriptures also refer to hell(s).It helps one to read and study a scripture one is chanting and see how it applies to us. That is why it is called svadhya - self study.<br />In Bali she is able to climb a bit out of her narcissistic shell and does help a woman there get a house for her and her children and is able to form a relationship with a man.<br />  In the end the reason I gave her one star because this book is not truthful and the author makes telling the truth a cornerstone of this journey which of necessity it must be. It appears that the author is unaware that she doesn't have the facts straight. I suspect she has always been glib and spun her way through things. I believe readers will read this book and it may bring them to inward exploration which is great. The imperative of this exploration is that we have to know what we know and not B.S. ourselves or others. .<br />My concern is that this book will  serve as an introduction to yoga and meditation  for many..

B00005JN8Z|5.0|Well I just received The french version of Quo Vadis.The Discs are the same as the American Version, but the two Folios of Glossy Pictures are Great. You get about 30 Pictures of Lobby pictures, Posters, behind the scenes, The Souvenier Program from the Road Show and the best is a cast posed picture on the Set. Why couldn't the American Version have done that.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I loved this movie!  This is one of those special little films that starts out slowly but just reaches out and touches your heart.  By the end of the film, I fell in love with the characters and the music they made together was so beautiful.  I am now online buying the movie and soundtrack for friends for Christmas.    Truly a very special and enjoyable film.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|These have been digitally remastered and includes the HD-DVD on one side and standard DVD on the other. There are plenty of bonus materials - \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" has a disk all to itself so that all of the bonus material can be included (\\"More Trouble, More Tribbles\\", etc.). If you are a fan of the Trek, then this is definitely worth the money.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I have seen the play on Broadway 5 times and fell in love.  Yes, I agree that the movie does not compare despite the scenery, wonderful actors and fantastic story line, but I have watched the dvd 3 times in the 2 days since it arrived.  That says something. You can't help but love the music and sing along, with or without the available subtitles. The songs did not flow as easily as they did in the play because I did not feel like the actors were in sync with the music in spots but they did a great job at something quite foreign to most of them and it was wonderful none the less.  I highly recommend this to Abba lovers and musical lovers of all ages.  I bought the 2 dvd set and the extras I have seen so far were well worth the extra few dollars.  Can't wait to go watch it again.  I was hoping for so long that they would turn the play into a movie and I am so glad they did and picked a perfect cast to do it!!  Thank you for giving me something I can enjoy over and over without having to leave the house.
0810995212|5.0|A charming, intellectual and exceedingly accurate text, well-researched, and nothing else even approaches it, including  bios on VanGogh, Picasso, and Gauguin. All negative comments are clearly from wannabees and sourpusses, inarticulate, incorrect reviews from undereducated jerkos. Push their rubbish aside and objectively read it for it is brilliantly written. Enjoy the best art book publisher (Harry Abrams) and his repros of JCL art works at their best - a great and laudable undertaking. Get the first edition if you still can-surely to become a valuable collectible. Recently ranked by Amazon; #1 for art books, #4 for fashion books and #5 for graphic design books-indicating the public knows best. But, a few malcontents can spoil anything in this computer age, and sometimes for no sound reason as exhibited here with a few the negative comments. A further indication of its superior quality follows:I recently read a friends copy and then tried to buy it, but it was back ordered until February-meaning it is selling out after a few short months. A gay friend bought ten copies for Xmas gifts and loaned me his copy (saying it is anything but homophobic,as one irate, uninformed so-called reviewer stated). He further said that the gay community considers the co-authors, not only super art historians,compelling writers of non-fiction, but also straight heroes!  A committed Leyendecker fan,   JGH
B001GJOL22|5.0|By Far the best concert BluRay you will ever own. Sound quality is mind boggling. The concert footage is crystal clear. I've been to 12 RUSH concerts and this is as close to the real thing as you will get. ASTONISHING!!! Play it loud, it just gets better. The better the equipment the better the experience. The camera angles around Getty, Alex and especially Niel are fanominal. If you have any interest in RUSH buy it. If you looking for a Xmas gift for a Rush fan THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!!

0439813786|5.0|This book is incredible!!  I saw it while volunteering in my granddaughter's 3rd grade classroom and because it was so unique in its design and illustration, I took it home to read with the teacher's permission and total recommendation (it was one of his favorite books).  What a treat I was in for - not only are the pictures so incredibly detailed, but the story is fascinating.  I couldn't believe this was a children's book....and in reality, it's a book for any age.  It quickly became one of my favorite books as well and I've been an avid reader my whole life reading 1,000's of books.  This book will truly become everyone's favorite.  Thank you Mr. Selznick for creating such a marvelous book and I sincerely hope the story will continue.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|When a Hollywood spoof movie like \\"Tropic Thunder,\\" comes with a special directors cut, you know things are getting out of hand. What's next, a special directors cut of Catwoman? It's an amazingly self indulgent and superfluous offering for a rather forgettable comedy. The movie itself is already way too long at 2 hours, and to add another 20 minutes of material turns it into a bloat fest of stale action that crushes the life out of the best jokes. This movie should have been an hour and a half long, tops.<br /><br />The theatrical version is not a bad comedy, if you like slap-stick, boundary pushing humor. There are some excellent moments in this movie; unfortunatly most of them take place in the first 3rd of the movie. The middle act sags, and if it wasn't for Robert Downy Jr., would be pure drudgery to get through. The last act is even more farcical than the first two, but manages to close well with the appearance of the excellently cast Matthew McConaughey who saves the day with a Tivo box... Made me laugh pretty hard. Tom Cruise also makes a cameo as a really whacked out movie producer with some serious issues (and a rap fetish!). Overall, a wonky cast of characters headed up by Stiller reprising every roll he's ever had. There's not much new from him here, but I stopped expecting anything new a long time ago.<br /><br />On the positive side, Robert Downy Jr. steals the show as an Australian actor who puts a new spin on 'black face' and getting immersed in a roll. He's hysterically funny in some scenes, and I can't help wishing it was him, not the largely unfunny Stiller, who directed the movie. I think it would have been shorter, edgier, and overall a much better movie.<br /><br />The theatrical version of the film gets 3 stars. The directors cut gets 2. Save your money and just get the theatrical version unless you just have to have another 20 minutes of Stiller indulging his ego... Better yet just buy \\"Iron Man\\" instead.

0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is the most popular proponent of atheism since Russel. Being a biologist , his argument focuses mostly on evolution and less on quantum physics.      It is a very enjoyable book for people who are agnostic/atheist but have not had a simple book for them to explain their point of view. Definitely very light compared to some of the works of Bertrand Russel (Why I am not a Christian ?) or Hume or Nietzsche.       This is not a book for firm believers who have no iota of doubt in their minds. They would get offended on the first page and after than lose objectivity.      Same thing happens to most atheist when they start reading the drivel written by the theologists.   On the book itself:  Most arguments are old and are presented in new fashion (religion brings wars , hatred , controlling lives of others , intolerance , 9/11).  Couple of new things which author had tackled is the indoctrination of children , innate human morality , existing of god in every culture. For the last 2 there are good theories presented but it is difficult to get evidence. Maybe we need an atheist Anthropologist too.

B001EN71DQ|4.0|Packaging - A cardboard box with slim cases for each movie.  So the \\"box set\\" is really nothing special or extra.  It is a box that holds the same versions that you could buy separately, which is a little disappointing.<br /><br />Movies - They're entertaining.  A lot of action (almost too much at times) and a decent but confusingly intertwined storyline (at times).<br /><br />The CGI is fun, but has already started to show its age.<br /><br />Some cheesy stuff like the Darth Vader \\"noooooooo\\" Frankenstein scene  (why didn't they just end the movie when they put the mask on Aniken and your heard the Darth Vader breathing?  That would have been so cool.)  All that extra made me feel like the movie needed to be edited.<br /><br />All-in-all, a fun bunch of movies to have around.  The price could have been a bit lower than the $32 I paid, but I thought it was a real box set, not just a box with the original movies inside.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|very good  -  should be a must for  kids and adults to see
B001DHXT20|4.0|Wow.  You know, with the recent run of superhero movies, I've yet to see anything that didn't really impress me.  Iron Man was amazing, Spider-man rocked, the Dark Knight was about as epic as they come, and the Incredible Hulk?    Was awesome.  And I do mean that in the classic sense of the word.  It inspired awe.  Edward Norton's performance as Bruce Banner was excellent, and filled with the subtlety that the role needs.  His \\"acting\\" as the Hulk was superb, too, bringing a lot of life and humanity to a basically inhuman character.  The scene with the Hulk and Betty in the cave was very good - you see him not as a monster or a hero, but more like a very huge child.    Tim Roth plays an excellent villain.  You find yourself really drawn in by his character and even though he's pretty much purely evil, you can empathize with him - which makes his transformation into the Abomination all the more frightening.    The only thing I didn't really like about the movie was Liv Tyler.  Her acting was remarkably flat for almost all of the scenes.  The only time she shows some life is when she's screaming at the cab driver.  The rest of the time she's very quiet and subdued, and she's speaking her lines only just above a whisper.  While that works well for an ethereal elf, it doesn't suit a human woman who can't even get some passion into a line like \\"Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.\\"  That's a pretty strong thing to say to your father, but Liv mutters it and it killed the drama for me.    Overall though, good acting, amazing special effects, a great story, and fantastically choreographed fight scenes.  This movie is definitely worth spending shelling out the money for.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet since there are many other reviews that get into the details of the series.<br /><br />This is what Blu-ray was made for. Stunning visuals that will grab you from the opening credits. If you have a Blu-ray player, you must get this!  If you don't have a player, this makes it worth buying one!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A marvelous animated film with a message that subtly wends its way throughout a well thought out story line.  The animators have created emotion into their robotic creations at a level that comes through as real and vibrant.  There are enough plot twists to keep the viewer totally engaged, and the ending is predictable, but also exactly the ending we want to see.  This film never disappoints and entertains from start to finish.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This book is not very scientific in its approach however its better that it isn't. It is a quick read and gives one a lot of ideas I am especially intrigued by the connections with airline crashes.
B001ACH4DS|2.0|Although I do give \\"David Cook\\" one more star than SoCalReviews did, I still found this album a big disappointment for all the reasons mentioned in that review (and I few that I confess I know nothing about). So rather than repeat his/her comments about monotonic screaming and lack of dynamic range, I refer you to that excellently written review.     I was a HUGE David Cook fan throughout his Idol run, and still have HUGE hopes for him as an artist.  However, as soon as I heard \\"Light On\\" - what should have been the best single on the album for it to be released as the debut - I knew there was going to be trouble.  Where is the subtlety and originality that characterized Cook's \\"Idol\\" performances?  Where's the edgy rocker who brings something *new* to the genre?  Where's the guy who claimed he'd love to win a Grammy AND a Tony for performing songs as diverse as \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Music of the Night\\"?      Almost none of this versatility is in evidence on \\"David Cook\\", unlike the more interesting and intuitive musical judgement he displayed on his pre-Idol \\"Analog Heart\\", an album I really like and hope to see re-released once Cook himself is released from his post-Idol commitments.      To be honest, I think the main problem with the whole thing is the grinding, overpowering, boring, drum-guitar cacophony that David has to compete with, particularly on the choruses of the songs.  The lyrics and melodies (when they can actually be heard) are just about what we fans were expecting and hoping for, but the producers got in the way.    So let's hope he takes a good look at what he allowed the producers to do to this album, and rediscovers his own \\"analog heart\\" very, very soon.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|First off, most of the one star complaints stem from the awful subtitling for the hearing impaired.  This means you'll get the [helicopters approachine] and [dog barks] subtitles.  This is annoying, and hopefully a subsequent release will have simple english subtitles.    ***Spoilers**  As for the movie itself, the artistry in this movie is incredible, with a smooth mix od 3D and 2D animation in all sorts of surreal vistas.  It's alomst worth watching in and of itself.  The future looks very real, with the grittiness of the streets to the almost disturbing cleanliness of the laboratories they visit.      My personal favorite scene was when Togusa and Batou were entering a hackers mansion, and get stuck in an hacked into and thrown into a \\"virtual tangle\\" causing them to go through the same motions in a slightly different environment every time.  The shootup in the grocery store was another excellent scene, making the viewer think along with Batou that he being attacked while his brain is actually getting hacked.    There is way too much meandering talk about free will versus determinism, how one can realize whether someone is truly conscious or not, and the nature of what is a \\"true\\" experience.  The long monologues lead to no real further understanding of the subject, were oversimplified, and destroy the entire point of fiction, which is to SHOW these dilemmas rather than TELL.  The movie SHOWS very well, and doesn't need to dumb down the conversation by stating explicitly what the viewer should ponder while watching it.    Overall, not nearly as good as the classic first, but still pretty good.
B001CZVVWS|4.0|At first, I hesitated to get this because of the negative reviews here but wanted to see for myself and got it anyway. After watching, I thought this blu-ray was not bad. Yes, the video pro-production was annoying in some parts but overall I enjoyed this blu-ray. The orchestra conducted by Chailly was really good and Urmana and the other female singer did a good job. I thought Alagna sang fine but notes were sometimes not accurate. I liked the ballet and kids' dance. The PQ is somewhat disappointing: distant (zoom-out) shots don't look very clear and sharp. AQ is excellent, however. All in all, this blu-ray was an enjoyment to me. I will definitely watch it over again. I'd encourage you to see it for yourself. You can rent at least...
0385340567|2.0|I only discovered the Jack Reacher novels two years ago and until now I have thoroughly enjoyed every one.  Although the mystery in this book kept me perplexed for several chapters I didn't really enjoy it.  I was put off by Jack Reacher's new attitude toward the U.S. military.  He is entitled to his opinion but I find the idea that it is now more honorable to desert than to serve insulting.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" is a pretty good documentary, although hardly Academy Award material. What it does well is to show us Al Gore as he travels the world trying to to scare people to join his brand of environmental religion. Yes, it's a religion: \\"Do your believe in global warming?\\" is the same question as \\"Do you believe in God?\\" or \\"Do you believe in Santa Claus?\\" It's asking, \\"Do you take on faith the coming global warming disaster scenario offered by Gore and other proponents?\\" It has to be on faith because the scientific evidence in Gore's presentation is (a) missing, (b) distorted, (c) half-truths or (d) outright lies. The facts of Gore's deceptions are well-covered on-line and in the one- and two-star reviews on this page.<br /><br />What director Davis Guggenheim does so well is show us exactly what Gore says and shows in his global warming presentation. Some examples: Gore says that a friend of his told him in the '70s that if the ice on the west shelf of Antarctica breaks up, \\"that could be a signal for global warming.\\" A friend? Who? If this statement is important (and it, because Gore builds a whole inference system from it) the the audience needs to know who this friend is. And \\"it could be a signal for global warming\\" offers a weak inference, because \\"Could be\\" it's not.<br /><br />Gore says he went up to the North Pole in a Navy submarine because he wanted to see the Navy's data on melting of the polar ice cap. Apparently these data are kept in a file cabinet on the bottom of the ocean, rather than in the offices of the Naval Observatory in Washington, which can be reached by cab instead of submarine. (Gore lived on the grounds of the Naval Observatory during his eight years as vice president.)<br /><br />What Guggenheim doesn't do is point out the inconsistencies in Gore's statements or cite the opposing evidence. Too bad.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|The music is very easy to listen to, and very smooth.  I love this CD.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|If someone exploring 70's arena rock for the first time were to ask me to pick a single song to introduce them to Boston, I would pick the title track from this album.  In fact the first four songs from Don't Look Back come close to making a perfect album side.  There's no question you should also check out their more popular first album as well (DO NOT miss Foreplay/Long Time), but in my opinion this album is just as good as the Boston debut.  Some people consider this album a couple of notches below the first album, but I like it just as much and maybe even a hair better.
B00003CXA6|3.0|I didn't know that the soldiers were able to get their uniforms to a 24 hour laundry service to be ready for the next battle. Not a wrinkle or scuff mark on any uniform. Alot of bonding, many philosopical interludes, even while battle lines are being formed. Though, if actual Civil war diaries are a guide, the \\"foot soldier\\" was a literate individual, a \\"student\\" of war. This motif is therefore, realistic; though the synthetic soundtrack doesn't help. At times, it sounds like outtakes from the \\"Rocky IV\\" sessions.<br />The script mentions 15 thousand here and 20 thousand there, and all we see are the same 160 guys huffing and puffing. Reviewers have criticized the unrealistic look of the \\"Re-enactors\\", but I understand that the Southern army did include many participants who did not fit the image, so to speak, because of the necessities of maintaining reasonable numbers. Although, I assumed that to be later in the War.<br />The script seems to be overly slanted towards the Military historian, as the constant references to flanks, infantry, cavalry, brigades, moving within specific battleplans, gets almost comical, which is not respectful to our Country's signature battle.<br />In the ending credits, it is written that the Battle was a (relative) failure. Some of the most interesting sections involve dialogue with the Generals regarding the potential of such a battle to actually end the War.<br />Very interesting montage at the end credits where actor and actual person come together. A bit crass but effective.<br />I thought that perhaps a graphic of The Gettysburg Address could have closed the film, though the Brothers embarcing was well done.<br />A very positive aspect of this film is the Gettysburg location itself. The movie begins and ends on the battlefield.

B0000DDAU9|5.0|MASSIVE DESTRUCTIVE POWER!<br /><br />No other words quite describes Mastodon and their insane combination of sludge, trash, groove, progressive, doom, and brutality to equal one of the best metal albums of the decade ever released on Relapse.  It's been said before, but Mastodon is MASSIVE, the real life equivalant of a gigantic monster crushing everything in it's path.  This is just a monster of an album, with sludgy riffs, brutal explosions and blasts of metal, absolutely amazing drumming, megatone bass, all backed up with strange beauty, roared vocals, and an amazing groove underneath it all (thanks to Brann Dailor's astounding drumming).<br /><br />On Remission, the theme of fire is the main idea (each album represents an Element, such as Blood Mountain representing Earth and the upcoming Crack The Skye represnting air).  I think the power of fire, the rage of fire, what fire represents both realistically and metaphorically.  Furthermore, each song has much representation of it's song title as well.  The lyrics are definitely the weakest point of the album, as they don't seem very interestingly written (not because they are difficult to understand, they just don't do much for me), but they do their job.<br /><br />Crusher Destroyer opens up the album with unbievable energy, this is the ultimate spazz air drummer's dream, a great song to play while driving a tank through your senior prom.  March Of The Fire Ants sets the done with it's crushingly good introduction and rips it like a swarm of fire.  Where Strides the Behemoth and Workhorse are two insanely crushinly addictive and catchy songs, with some of Brann Dailor's best grooves on the disc.  Ole Nessie conveys the ancient power of the legendary sea creature, and carries a sad, melancholy, and peaceful sound, like drifting in the high seas.  Sick drumming in the verses again, that groove is undenaibly good.<br /><br />After the manic Burning Man (easily one of the best songs on the disc), the album takes more of an epic turn, with the Mastodon like-Trampled Under Hoof and the groovingly good Mother Puncher sandwiched between.  The epic's that follow may be the best, especially the epic Trainwreck, easily the most fuffilling album on the disc.  Trilobite is the weakest of the three epic songs, but it has some nice drumming, riffs, and dynamics.  But the real gem is Elephant Man, an atmospheric, damn well composed track with traces of southern rock.  Ultra booming sludge riffs only paint the aural landscape even more, and the solo is ace.  Probably my favorite track on here, and even with the totally pointless ending.  It's the song that counts, and I have the right to press stop when the songs ends, and it ends when the song is over.<br /><br />Yeah, it's not the best album of the century so far, but as far as heavy metal fan goes, if you like your heavy metal to be more than just the same, Remission, along with the rest of their metal, is one to add to your wishlist.  These guys stand tall in the face of today's tardcore (As I lay Dying is a good example), and make me hate Atlanta, Georgia a little less.<br /><br />9/10Mastodon like-Trampled Under Hoof and the groovingly good Mother Puncher sandwiched between.

It's the song that counts, and I have the right to press stop when the songs ends, and it ends when the song is over.    Yeah, it's not the best album of the century so far, but as far as heavy metal fan goes, if you like your heavy metal to be more than just the same, Remission, along with the rest of their metal, is one to add to your wishlist.  These guys stand tall in the face of today's tardcore (As I lay Dying is a good example), and make me hate Atlanta, Georgia a little less.    9/10

1416594884|5.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />I'm not going to make any bones about \\"A Most Wanted Man.\\"  It's one of le Carre's best works to date.<br /><br />Le Carre continues to run rings around other writers in the espionage thriller field.  Whereas most of these writers feel compelled to espouse their political views at the expense of story and character and to mortgage their talent to their PC publishers who have political axes to grind, le Carre remains objectively bent on telling a well-crafted, well-written story.<br /><br />Other, lesser, writers, propagandists essentially, may fume and pontificate on their soapboxes about their political weltanschauungs in preachy novels that masquerade as thrillers.  Le Carre, however, doesn't permit his political biases to interfere with his art.  This is especially true in \\"A Most Wanted Man,\\" which is more a novel than it is a thriller in the sense that there isn't much action in it.  It's a novel about lies, manipulation, and double-dealing in the spy game, where the innocent and the guilty become caught up in an internecine clandestine political imbroglio beyond their control.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Dark Horse by Nickelback is the most awesome album I've heard in a long time. I love every single song on it. The music and lyrics are superb! I'm very impressed and will recommend this to all my friends!
1594489505|4.0|First of all, let me say I loved this book. I also may have cried more during this book than any other. But the reviews  on the cover, and many I've read here keep using phrasing like \\"triumphing over the Taliban\\" \\"Under Taliban rule\\", ect. Personally, I feel that is missing the point. Mariam's mistreatment began way before the Taliban came to rule, which is actually a relatively short portion of the entire book. To me, it was more about people (usually men, but not always) selfishly preserving their place and privileges by putting anyone \\"less\\" than them down. I feel this is really Hosseini's message, that people should not let their pride and selfishness allow them to mistreat another, even if the actions are condoned by their culture, religion, or government.  On a light note, I was fascinated by the Kabulites obsession with the movie \\"Titanic\\", and Googled the subject and found many interesting articles chronicling this phenomena. Jack and Rose Triumph Over the Taliban!
B000078DOI|3.0|3 1/2    Taken to the logical extension, MM feels like a culmination of their distinctively crazed early period vibe refined to its classiest measures. It would still take one more album for the group's best songwriting abilities to come into the fore, but taking one last sip of this old-school freak-funk incarnation always proves refreshing.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|I really think people need to listen to this album at least twice through before brushing it off. Happenstance is one of my top 10 albums and i had great expectations for this album. I hated Elephants, as a whole, first listen through.Then while doing dishes one night i put my ipod on and listened again. and again. The songs may take a few listens to get into your head, but after a few listens they will get under your skin. I think it was a good decision to put the first part of the album on disc one and the faster on disc two, as a whole the mood entirely shifts with the faster songs. My favorites on this are Elephants, Sunday Afternoon, Horizon, What if I Leave, Faster, and Sidedish Friend. If you get the chance to see her live, do so. I think her faster songs on this album translate better live and her voice is even more amazing than on her albums
B001F7MSFW|1.0|What a let down for Hellboy I fans...This movie totally sucked...Hollywood amazingly turned goth camp into surfer bubblegum for a terminally boring ride.
B000MV9026|3.0|HAPPY FEET is indeed the animated tale of a dancing penguin who has no choice but to dance.  His name is Mumbles (voice of Elijah Wood) and he is meant to be seen as someone special and different from others of his tribe. Mumbles is simply bursting with a never-ending supply of optimism, faith, and a Jimmy Stewart-ish belief that hard work and honesty can solve all the world's ills. In this case, the very survival of his world of penguins at the South Pole is threatened when their food supply is inexplicably reduced to near nothing. Until this point, HAPPY FEET could have been simply a retread of any number of Disney animations that featured adorable characters facing a predator.  But here, HAPPY FEET morphs into a leftist global warming screed that pulls no stops to indicate that Al Gore was right after all when he sees mankind as the ultimate scourge of itself.  The food supply is rapidly being depleted by what Mumbles calls \\"Aliens,\\" creatures who are truly dumb enough to destroy their own nest.  In between the many songs and dance numbers which are quite captivating even for grownups, the film insists on a subtext that demands a scapegoat for this planet's perils.  Though global warming is not mentioned, HAPPY FEET points an unhappy finger at a collective humanity that is unwittingly intent on eradicating the penguin population. Humanity is initially presented as blissfully unaware of the impending doom.  If only SOMEONE could alert the unthinking world that we are one on Planet Earth. And this is where HAPPY FEET falls into lockstep with the green crowd. Amidst a general musical hoopla of a mass dancing televised worldwide, the crisis is first addressed then averted.  Tree huggers save the day.  And Mumbles even looks like a pint-sized Al Gore.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|I watched this movie once and will only watch it once. I do recommend it for Lynch lovers (as well as Dern lovers),lovers of surreal film and the avant-garde.<br /><br />Others on this site have already relayed the plot and even sub textual discourses, but for me, at about the 2.15  mark I really just wanted the movie to end. I began to fast forward just to accomplish this. It wasn't a bad movie but I lost interest in the film's schizophrenia. Its much like a person with a multiple personality disorder came into your house, after a while you don't want to be around them, same with this film. But I was curious how it would end...would she find herself again? Is she doomed to die? Who would die as foretold by the old woman in the opening; I suppose the questions are answered in the end but we also are made to feel that there is no real resolution to Nikki/Sue's (Dern) dilemma (open ending). You as the bystander, targeted viewer, will suffer what the primary character suffers. Both for her and as well, because of her.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|If I had to pick a film that will remind of 2008, Dark Knight would win hands down!  Heath Ledger is simply amazing as the diabolical Joker who wants nothing more than to see the city burn and destroy itself.  Bale is great as Batman and as far as I'm concerned is to the Batman franchise what Daniel Craig is to the Bond franchise.      If I were to pick one thing that bothered me about the movie (not really a complaint mind you but more of an observation) is that Joker is not given enough screen time.  Ledger steals every scene he's in and proves that he left us too soon.  If he does win a posthumous Oscar, it is well deserved.
B000078DOH|3.0|3 1/2    Like their early funk-punk approach or not, this mid-80's sophomore release still packs a punch. It is one of those rare, wisely put together party rock discs made in that decade that actually grows better with age, providing ample subtly amongst all the upbeat frenzy. These songs appeared so uniquely brash when debuting, it was easy to dismiss some, though in retrospect FS remains as hot a dish the Pepper's ever served.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I watched this when it first came out and remember being not so impressed, though for the life of me I am not sure why I was so disappointed. Last night I noticed it was offered free On Demand, so I settled in for yet another viewing. This movie is terrifying, the scenes well shot, the characters believable, the courtroom drama was intense and the shots of the exorcism absolutely riveting. It scared me out of my wits so much that when I awoke in the middle of the night, I was terrified to look at the clock. Watch and you'll see why.
B000M4RG4C|5.0|Having seen this three times now (once in movie theater and two times on DVD), it makes me appreciate the sacrifices of the Marines in the island hopping campaigns of Pacific during WW II. Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job in capturing the suffering of those who were involved in the Iwo Jima battle. Also, it was an informative movie to me. I had no idea about the 2nd flag rising and the fate of those who did it. Job well done!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I took 2 of my granddaughters to see Twilight, being prepared to not like it.  By the end of the film I was enchanted with the characters and storyline.  I knew then I had to have the soundtrack.  What a variety of styles and can you believe my favorite is Supermassive Black Hole by Muse?  I am 67 years old and surprised at how much I like this CD.  Me and the girls have discussed the music, what we liked and what we didn't. Such a simple thing but it is so much fun to talk about things that are popular to them.  I have always believed you have to listen to a CD at least 3 times to really decide if you like it or not..and.. I like it.  Enjoy!
B00127RAJY|2.0|I found this workout way too boring.  The third stage was somewhat tough but it wasn't something I would want to do over and over again.  I would recommend the Women's Health videos rather than this.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this movie. It's great for anyone who enjoys these period movies. The acting is wonderful and the story is exceptional.
B000000W6F|3.0|3 1/2    Besides the original tinny production and some slight repetition with the songwriting, first generation alternative debuts rarely sounded as assured as Gish did. This has dated a bit over the years, but the influence and underlying chemistry which made the band stand out amongst many peers remains evident.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|Edward Norton does a nice job revitalizing Bill Bixby's Dr. Bruce Banner, a sharp contrast to the Incredible Hulk.    Good action and film locations along with the classic good guy vs bad guy sub-plot.    If you enjoyed the original TV series, definitely worth checking out.
0670020745|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this, and the first part, when Taylor talked about her life pre-stroke, went well.  The second part, about the anatomy of the brain, was somewhat dry but necessary. But then, talking about her treatment and recovery, she segued time and time again into melodramatic overload: \\"My head pulsed with a tormenting pain...\\" \\"I couldn't hear anything beyond the pounding rhythm of my heart...\\" as well as silly philosophizing: \\"In silent prayer,I reflected, I am not supposed to be here anymore!\\"  I'm glad others enjoyed it, but after p. 70 or so I gave up.
031606792X|5.0|i read what ppl had said bout the book when i bought it from amazon a few weeks ago... i was very worried to read the book from what some ppl had said bout the book not being good and not being as good as the 3 before this one... well i can tell u this and this is strictly only my opinon of the book but i feel the book was well GREAT!!! i mean we all knew from the first book that Bella was determined to become a vampire so she would spend forever with Edward, so that was one thing we should of all known was goin to happen at some point... granted she did change alot cuz she was not clumbsy anymore like she was before she became immortal but come on ppl all the Cullens were very graceful and it was a given that vampires are gracefull so that was also a given that she would no longer be the clumbsy Bella that got hurt all the time...   i think it just added to the book that Bella and Edward had a child, which i thought was well rather sweet... as for how it started and most of the Cullens wanted her to get rid of the child till Edward could hear what the baby was thinking and then he fell in love with the baby as much as Bella had from the start... it just well fit the story very well that they should have a child and now they do...   and for Jake imprinting on the baby it was just another thing that was kinda a given from when we first found out that Alice could not see the baby's future... Bella always said that Jake was ment to be in her life just not as a couple and well it just fit that he is now part of her life cuz he imprinted on the baby...   but all together i am sad to say that i am done with all four books... i only wish they didnt stop here... i would of liked to follow Bella and Edwards life a while longer if Meyer would of kept goin with the books... and now that they have Renneesme (prob misspelled i dont have the book close to get the spelling but u know what i mean) i would of loved to see how her life was as well... it just left me wanting more sadly and i know there will be no others after this one... but as for all the books i felt they were very good books.. i read them all real quick and i think i will read them all again...   but like i said that was only my opinion and wel all have our own on this subject as well as many other subjects...   ~peace  and Merry Christmas!!!! and a Happy New Year!!!!
1401203078|4.0|I love Alan Moore, but he does need to learn that sometimes less is more when it comes to writing prose.  He does go on.  And on.  The more classic graphic novel parts of this collection come as a huge relief after some of the small print endlessly verbose essays, but no matter what, I got hours of enjoyment out of this and would buy it again.
6305657947|5.0|No need to compare this with the first film with Steve McQueen- because its a totally different storyline.  The world of art theft investigation is intriguing to many people and this is a completely enjoyable film.  Even though one wonders if some aspects in the story would really be possible it doesn't matter. Faye Dunaway makes a very short appearance which is a nice nod to the original, but this version is much slicker, more modern, quite entertaining.  A great date movie, or late night endulgence!
B0015AARJI|5.0|A great price on still the best controller around. I have yet to find an aftermarket controller that feels as nice as the standard Sony model.
B00005N5S5|4.0|As always, Amazon did a great job delivering this DVD. It arrived on time and in good shape. I've never had a problem with Amazon.<br />The movie is a bit old and clunky now, but it's still fun to watch and a good companion piece to T2, the sequel.<br />It's funny to see our governator all dressed up and playing a cyborg.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Once a horror movie is now a morality play. Completely identifiable characters and identifies predjudices and their consequences. Browning suffered after making this film but he was a visionary for sure.
159448385X|5.0|I liked this one even better than Kite Runner and it's hard to top that one.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NA2BEU Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season]][[ASIN:B000FL7CAK Veronica Mars - The Complete Second Season]]  I loved this series I was so sad when they stopped making the show
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This came exactly when they said it was.  I'm so happy to have it as part of my collection now.
B001GKJ2F2|2.0|The only thing good about this movie is Angelina Jolie. she is great in anything, but this movie has no redeeming value.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|Slick, steady and predictable rock from the boys down south. Some new cool sounds and catchy stuff. You will enjoy this one...
B0014BQQYS|5.0|This 1969 WESTERN ( Listed as a TOP 100 AFI Film in 1998) CLASSIC is an OUTSTANDING Movie period!!!    The STANDARD SPECIAL EDITION DVD is wonderful and if you own it and have a a DVD player with the HDMI upconverting feature will give you near HD Quality Picture (1080i lines) and sound for many years.  This SPECIAL EDITION is loaded with every extra feature to include; 45 min documentary, interviews with the stars, audio commentary, production notes and trailers.    If you have a Blu-ray/HDMI Home Theatre System and want to know why buy a 1969 movie NOW, here's the answer.  This Blu-ray version includes everything the Standard DVD has, BUT there is one UNBELIEVABLE difference.  THE FEATURE PRESENTATION (at 1080P (1920 x 1080 lines with HDMI)) AND DTS 5.1 SOUND IS TOTALLY INCREDIBLE period!!!!! The picture clarity and sound are so fantastic.  It feels like you are there in the movie.  Youthful Paul Newman and Robert Redford are quite alive for this enjoyable western classic.    Believe me, the colors, detailed sets, costumes beautiful panoramic landscapes in TECHNICOLOR is awesome!!  This is a must have for your HD Blu-ray w/HDMI Home Theater Library.  A great film period. ENJOY!!
0767827902|5.0|In the dried-up old town of Anarene, Texas, there's not much for boys to do but chase girls and play pool.  High school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms), his best friend Duane (Jeff Bridges), and Jacey, the prettiest girl in town (Cybil Shepherd), start to grow up and make some decisions about their future.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this movie.  The windy, dusty town felt familiar and even cozy by the end of the movie, and the good ol' folks living in it seemed like neighbors.  Bottoms, Bridges, and Shepherd are wonderful (and young!) as the kids, all of them giving sympathetic, memorable performances.  Ben Johnson plays the nicest man in town and Cloris Leachman is a lonely married woman; they both won Best Supporting Oscars playing very real and vulnerable characters.<br /><br />The movie is directed at a leisurely pace so we can absorb the small-town atmosphere; Anarene became full of interesting people with hopes and dreams.  This is indeed a timeless classic that will appeal to those who like character-driven stories about ordinary people.  Highly recommended.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|this film seems to take place around the events of Episode 2, and fills in the character of Count Dooku for the viewers.  Here we have sort of a backstory on him and his relationship with the soon-to-be Evil Emperor, which will eventually create the Imperial Republic.<br /><br />In the feature film Episode 2, \\"Attack of the Clones\\", the Count didn't have a lot of screen time, and therefore his character was a bit under-developed.  Here, we get to see his partnership with the Emperor and how it will set the stage for the events in Episode 3, \\"Revenge of the Sith\\".  It helps to \\"fill in the gaps\\" that were left out of Episode 2.
0307455874|5.0|Received the books (I bought 4 copies for my family) very quickly and they were in perfect condition...excellent.
B001NB6IN8|4.0|Great album. Especially for sex.  Although, I do agree that this album is not their best I do feel like they have \\"evolved\\" somewhat. Whether that means being a better band or just changing in general. I also agree that the lyrics are not as well thought out as their previous albums. As a personal fan of Pete's writing style I was really looking forward to something spectacular, and instead got this. Whatever it is. One thing's for sure, this album strongly implicates him not being so stoked about his relationship with Ashlee. The dude sounds super set on leavin her very soon. Never-the-less there's also hints of his happiness at being a father throughout the album, as well.  Patrick is awesome, of course. I just wish this album wasn't so repititious at times.  There's also some curveballs, too. (Which I enjoy) like a spoken word outro from pete, and an old blues-ie Acapella outro for Patrick.  My favorite tracks (in order) are; 20 dollar nose bleed, W.A.M.S., Disloyal Order..., Tiffany blews, 27, she's my Winona.  I don't care if I ever hear \\"I don't care\\" ever again in my life.  Beware, this is a pop album of phenomenal proportions;)
0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, written by the late Steig Larsson starts slowly but increases drama and speed as two story lines build in parallel time.<br />The heiress to a wealthy, seriously dysfunctional family's money has disappeared thirty years previously when she was a young teen. Her uncle still has doubts about her probable murder and wangles a way to put a journalist on the job, finding any information on the seriously cold case. The journalist has quite recently lost his reputation and has to spend three months in jail for a crime that is unclear to me. What has happened is that the author has lost a bitter court battle with the evil Wennerstrom, an important Swedish businessman.<br />The parallel character is the eponymous girl with the tattoo, an intriguingly disaffected young woman who is kept in legal thrall, again for reasons that I fail to understand. The Swedish legalities and financial mazes aren't familiar to me but are important to the story, so I muddle through without fully comprehending the ins and outs of the laws. Nevermind, it matters not enough to prevent the reader from following the story, becoming totally involved in the outcome.<br />The English translation is awkward in places but is honest and understandable. That and the Swedish legal system won't stop us from this fascinating thrill ride!

B001F12J48|1.0|I am a big big fan of ,\\"The Polar Express\\". I have waited and waited to see it in 3D.In fact,every time I watch it on DVD I slightly cross my eyes to somewhat get the 3D effect.Imax theaters are too far away,so I was so overjoyed when it finally came on 3D in the DVD format...    ...Hsss boo..I am sad to say that the 3D on the DVD version is really 4 F.It is terrible.There are ghost images and the exciting 3D effects are either too blurry or shoddy in this piss poor 3D.    Sometimes you can get the feel for how wonderful the real truely perfect 3D must appear but in this version,it is only a showdow of what I know the theater version must have produced.    Knowingly selling this sub par production is a crime and every fan that had hoped to see \\"The Polar Express\\" in 3D at it's very best should be given double their money back.    I am strongly disappointed..in fact...broken hearted.I was so so excited to see this movie in quality 3D...shame on the movie makers allowing this poor quality 3d product to be sold just for the extra $$$.
B001IWO870|5.0|Rick Riordan once again delivers a non-stop fun and wise cracking adventure. From saucy t-shirts to unbelievable monsters and a nice review of Greek Mythology, these books are fabulous and the latest is just as great. Can't wait for the next one!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I hated this movie.  I watched it several times. I was interested, but there was nothing to be received from this movie.  It was like I was eaves dropping on someone's drugged out consciousness.  I refused to believe that there was something to get from this movie.  If there was a key to the movie ... the Director swallowed it.  You would be better off watching Limbo.  With Limbo, you will at least know why you're mad.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I'm just going to review the quality of the blu-ray...  AMAZING!  The IMAX parts look astounding on my Samsung 42'' plasma.  The transition to letterbox to IMAX is hardly noticible and does not distract from the movie.  I have had no sound issues with my Yamaha receiver hooked to my PS3.  Looks and sounds great.
B000002LND|1.0|I was so excited to get this CD and when I did all the songs on it were skipping!  I was very dissapointed to say the least.
0375842209|5.0|It had great character development and story line--in a very intersting time in history.  I found I really cared about the people who were always villanous to me--Germans living in Germay during the Holocaust.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I rarely write reviews but I had to chime in on this one!  Before I knew it, I found myself dancing in my seat, tapping my feet, humming along, smiling, and sitting until the very ending of the credits and singing along once more to the songs.  I couldn't care less if Pierce Bronsen can carry a tune or not; this is simply a delightful, funny, and charismatic way to spend almost 2 hours.
B000069HJN|5.0|I love every song of this album - and that is the best of Supertramp per my opinion. Supertramp created an album with thematically linked songs, pretty much as The Dark Side Of The Moon of Pink Floyd earlier. It was written many years ago, but if you listen it carefully now you can find a lot of meanings can be directly linked to political situation in United States now, isn't that amazing!! Five Stars production, must have!
1594201927|3.0|This book demands a fairly high level of familiarity with financial jargon.  I have a masters degree in business, and this book has lost my interest early on.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|This is by far the best, coolest, most eventful season of Doctor Who. David Tennant pretty much rules as the 10th Doctor and Catherine Tate is perfect as Donna.    For Canadians: If you watched season 4 on CBC this fall, you NEED to buy this DVD because they cut out some very important scenes, especially in the finale (lots of explanations that are pretty much necessary)    The only disappointment I found was that outtakes were not included, and that's enough to lose a full star otherwise I would have rated it 5/5.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Meryl Streep plays a single mom whose daughter Sophie is about to be married.  Sophie has never known who her father is and in an attempt to find out she does a bit of detective work via her mom's diary.  She discovers that there are three men who potentially could be her dad, and she invites them all to the wedding unbeknowst to her mother.    Watching Meryl Streep and her two buddies recreate their old singing group or Meryl Streep singing to her daughter who is about to be wed will take you from cheers to tears.  Streep's acting abilities translate beautifully to her singing, whether it's a teary-eyed mother reminiscing about her daughter's childhood or a feisty middle-aged woman leading the other local women in a rousing Abba song.  This movie is just plain fun, so watch it and enjoy!
0670020745|3.0|Jill Bolte Taylor, Ph.D. provides a phenomenal account of her stroke and her recovery.  For patients, families, and health care providers, the best parts of \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" are certainly Dr. Bolte Taylor's two appendices: \\"Ten Assessment Questions\\" and \\"Forty Things I Needed the Most.\\"  It would be a mistake, however, to confuse Dr. Bolte Taylor with being a spiritual leader or a theological expert.      In regard to religion and spirituality, Dr. Bolte Taylor places an extremely strong emphasis on altered states of consciousness:  * \\"Swathed in an enfolding sense of liberation and transformation, the essence of my consciousness shifted....I think the Buddhists would say I entered the mode of existence they call Nirvana\\" (p. 49). * \\"My entire self-concept shifted as I no longer perceived myself as a single, a solid, an entity with boundaries....at the most elementary level I am a fluid....My soul was as big as the universe and frolicked with glee in a boundless sea\\" (p. 69).    Rather than aiming to unite ourselves with the will of God, Dr. Bolte Taylor seems to simply associate the aim of prayer with the experience of intense feelings:  * \\"I believe the experience of Nirvana exists in the consciousness of our right hemisphere, and that at any moment, we can choose to hook into that part of our brain\\" (p. 111).  * \\"brain research performed by Drs. Andrew Newberg and the late Eugene D'Aquili earlier this decade have helped me understand....Using SPECT technology (single photon emission computed tomography), these scientists identified the neuroanatomy underlying our ability to have a religious or spiritual (mystical experience)....Tibetan monks and Franciscan nuns were invited to pray inside the SPECT machine.  They were instructed to tug on a cotton twine when they reached their meditative climax or felt united with God.  These experiments identified shifts in neurological activity in very specific regions of the brain....when my left language centers were silenced and my left orientation association area was interrupted from its normal sensory input, my consciousness shifted away from feeling like a solid, to a perception of myself as a fluid - at one with the universe\\" (pp. 135, 136).  How would Dr. Bolte Taylor account for arid experiences of prayer, such as what has been famously described of Mother Theresa of Calcutta?    While offering a very wide perspective, Dr. Bolte Taylor does not seem able to adequately explain evil.  Hints about HER perspective on the life hereafter are very unsatisfying:    * \\"In the consciousness of my right mind, we are all good and we are all beautiful - just the way we are\\" (p.140).  * \\"My right mind realizes that the essence of my being has eternal life.  Although I may lose these cells and my ability to perceive this three-dimensional world, my energy will absorb back into the tranquil sea of euphoria\\"  (p. 160).

B001GAPC1K|5.0|I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. It starts off a little slowly then continues to build. The video quality is very good but not reference. The audio quality is very good with good use of surrounds.
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks' \\"World War Z\\" is an amazing book. Fantastic writing, excellent pacing and absorbing characters all make for a great read. The best part, for me anyway, were the points of view that Brooks decides to write from. Whenever I watch a movie where Zombies or some incarnation thereof are a focal point, I always find myself wondering about the bigger picture. The films tend to focus on the small group of survivors or the brave family or town defending themselves against the monsters. They're also almost always set in the United States or Great Britian. Brooks' novel takes a look at all the aspects of the Zombie plague you never get to see in the movies. The government's reaction, the military, and most especially, international points of view.    He also answers some of the niggling questions some of us may have developed while watching the old Zombie flicks. What happens when the Zombies reach water? How about winter? Brooks manages to answer these questions and more in a writing style that, while informative, still manages to pack an emotional punch.
B0017IKR7K|4.0|I love the album myself, but my wife says it just isn't as good as she thought it would be.  I think it is a great cruisin' cd.  She thinks it is a great snoozin' cd.  I am the one doing this review, so it gets a four out of five stars!
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|Die Hard has always been one of my favorite movies but Live Free or Die Hard is my favorite of the 4 in the series. The action is nonstop, Bruce Willis and Justin Long play well off each other. The video and audio quality is reference. It is one of my favorite blu-ray movies. I wish they would have released the unrated version on blu-ray.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|Overall, we are very pleased with the features of this 3-disc edition: lots of little extras which complement the movie nicely. However, I've had problems trying to download the digital copy onto our laptop; in fact, after several attempts, it still doesn't show up on my iTunes. It would have been nice for our 2-year-old son to be able to watch it 'on the go', since it's his favorite movie, but I just don't have time to spend hours on the Web doing research to try find a solution to something that should happen automatically... That's the reason behind the 3-star rating.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie will not dissappoint! Great to sit down with the kids and watch. Thank you Pixar!
B000W4HIXQ|4.0|I enjoy the series, have to have all 4 and in blu-ray even better. The video and audio quality is good, better than Die Hard 1 and 2 because it is newer. Good use of surrounds with directionality. The blu-ray is worth the upgrade from standard dvd.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|I am a fan of Sarah McLachlan.  For a Christmas CD, however, this one is a downer. The whole feel of the CD is very understated, too understated for my liking. The title song, \\"Wintersong,\\" is good, and I really like her interpretation of \\"Christmas Time is Here.\\"  I also like her interpretation of Joni Mitchell's song, \\"River.\\"  However, even though Christmas is mentioned in that song, it seems to me to be too depressing a choice for a Christmas CD.  Overall, \\"Wintersong\\" is not a bad CD, it's certainly different than most Christmas CD's, but it won't get you in the Christmas spirit.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|I love everything about this movie. Vince Vaughn didn't have a large role but he was funny. Brad and Angelina play well off each other. The blu-ray video and audio quality were reference. The surrounds were used extensively. One of my favorite movies on blu-ray.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Like Lambchop, Elbow is a band that can slip unawares before you knew they were even in the room.  Their latest release, The Seldom Seen Kid, is so skillfully subtle, it may be to their detriment.  It's a clever release that's as ethereal musically as it is lyrically.  Hence, I would declare it a near masterpiece, for whatever that's worth.    Though a highly meticulous and methodical output, don't think that words like ethereal or quietly confessional make the band's sound out to be less than what rock and roll should encompass.  Indeed, dare I say the band employs a certain amount of cheek, specifically in songs like An Audience with the Pope or The Fix, that their quiet nature can take a turn for the devilishly devious.    Other songs like Some Riot, Mirrorball, Tower Crane Driver, Weather to Fly, and Starlings reach and ultimately place Elbow's sound well within the atmosphere, with the characteristic British melancholy rightly exemplified in other bands like The Good, The Bad & The Queen.   Deceptively good stuff.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|I love this movie, having watched it many times. When I saw it was coming out in blu-ray I didn't hesitate to buy it. Although I'm still glad I did, the video quality was on the poor side for a blu-ray. The audio quality was slightly better. I was definitely expecting FOX to do more to improve the quality of this blu-ray. I was definitely disappointed in what I saw/heard.
B00000AGI0|5.0|This refers to the 24k gold remastered cd by DCC. This version sounds warmer with nice deeper bass and well balance highs, it's better than the Warner remaster series to my ears, too bad they didn't do VH2 and Women and Children first. Also this release is rare since it's out of print, and can be expensive on ebay.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I enjoyed the movie as was expected. I hadn't seen it in the theatre. Heath Ledger played one of the best villains I've ever seen. The video quality of the blu-ray was outstanding. It is a very dark movie. Detail was very good especially in the Imax parts of the movie which were the best of any blu-ray I've seen. The audio was reference or near-reference. The surrounds were used throughout the movie with LFE being prominent.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I have never been so scared in my life - there are just too many people  out there who cannot overcome their desires to seek revenge. This revenge  is usually predigated upon an imagined or a real wrong for which the term  'forgiveness' does not even enter into the equation.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|I was very happy to see this come out in blu-ray. The video quality isn't as good as I would have liked. The audio codec is better than standard dvd but I would have liked more LFE. It still is a movie I'll continue to watch over and over especially now on blu-ray making it even more enjoyable.

0316113506|4.0|This is an exceptional book on why exercise should be the cornerstone of your life.<br /><br />The only problem is it may be a little \\"stiff\\" for the less scientifically inclined. I have a Masters degree in Engineering Physics and I had to step back in key paragraphs to re-read it. Got it, but it sometimes took patience. On the other hand, it also may be a testament to the depth of this book. It would have been nice if there could have been more tables, charts and figures to help examine the material. Instead of text only to describe biochemical mechanism within the body, there should be accompanying drawings. If there were, then it would have been a 5 out 5.<br /><br />What's astounding about this book is that he  gives the reader all the latest, myth busting research right up to the end of 2007. All his evidence will have you no longer saying to your kids \\"Did you finish your homework, then you can go out to play\\" but rather \\"Did you finish your playing outdoors, then you can do your homework\\". Suffice it to say we were never built to sit at a desk. We haven't changed much since the days of tracking down prey with combinations of walking, jogging and sprinting to make the kill. Yet, most people burn less than 50% of the calories that our ancestors did. This is compounded by our lack of focus on fitness coupled to a sedimentary work life. And I think that is the premise of the book and may be the root cause of all the afflictions he goes on to talk about: kid's poor scores in school, adult and child obesity, dementia, parkinson disease and depression to name a few. He also gives the latest research insights for fitness with number of days, hours and intensity levels that are best. Unfortuately, he doesn't go into details of the how to run, weightlift etc. That I think is for another book.
032147404X|5.0|Hello, I found this book to be just as fantastic as all the other many reviews here.

0316017922|2.0|Seems like Gladwell and Colvin [[ASIN:1591842247 Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else]] might be long lost relatives because essentially they are sipping from the same well,writing about the same topic and all at the same time in history. Albeit, different stories, that's a relief. Problem is some of the stories and data gets emphasized, in my view, improperly. They both site [[ASIN:0521600812 The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance]] by Ericsson. They both delve into the 10,000 hour rule and deliberate practice (Colvin is more explicit on this key point). But the practice angle, while a sexy topic, is the least important of several key conditions. It gets pulled out of what I would call a \\"framework\\" for excellence or creating expertise. Google \\"The Making of and Expert\\" July, 2007 HBR if you want a short and concise lesson on creating expertise in less than 10 pages. Cheaper too! I reviewed Colvin so I will not repeat everything (you can see my review by clicking on my name above) but the other conditions, and parents will be thankful for the recognition, are:<br /><br />1) Strong family support - Gladwell's stories in a way support this<br />2) Good Coaching - Stories support this and kids can't typically get this without condition #1.<br /><br />I like Gladwell's stories and would give them a 5. But because the original research gets twisted it loses substantial credibility with me. Anecdotal evidence is interesting but its not something to bet your house on.

I was swept up with the writing and Breaking Dawn is well written, explains more of Jacob and lets your imagination run wild with the end.  There is so much more Stephenie and pick up in future books should she ever decide to and I hope she does.    I do not want to write much about this book out of respect of those who have yet to read it.  I will however tell you that book explains much about Bella and just how strong she really is and her relationship with Jacob.    Breaking Dawn would be my favorite out of the Saga and I have already began reading them start to finish once again.

B0006N2EZ0|1.0|The Bodyguard (1992) You know, after seeing a movie like this, I sometimes wish I had a bodyguard who would rush me from the room whenever a bad movie appeared. But I don't, so I was forced to watch Kevin Costner as a former Secret Service agent trying to protect a superstar singer/actress (Whitney Houston). There's a lot wrong with this movie, and it gets sillier as it goes along. Let's look at a few of the problems: Costner and Houston have no chemistry together; first-time actress Houston being cast as an Oscar-nominated actress (whose acting we never get to see); a mystery I had solved in the first ten minutes; \\"tough guy\\" Costner only getting to beat up two out-of-shape guys who present no challenge; and a completely ludicrous climax that takes place at the Academy Awards, where the stars are shown arriving at night (!), with a killer who's smart enough to rig a gun inside a video camera but not smart enough to include a silencer! Whew! This one's the bottom of the barrel! A couple of good songs on the soundtrack do not a movie make!
B001GKJ2FW|2.0|Meryl Streep is pretty good.  Pierce Brosnan is awful - he can't sing and shouldn't try.  There is a kind of peculiar slant to this movie - all the strong roles go to women - the men are weak and have marginal roles.  Most of the emotional and physical intimacy is between women with men shut out.  If this is your cup of tea, you might like this movie.

B001GKJ2FC|4.0|With the massive success of numerous comic book films over the last decade or so, most of which have been based on well-known characters, eventually the Hollywood studios would gain enough confidence in the genre to tread into somewhat unknown territory by attempting to adapt lesser-known comic books. Hollywood has previously dabbled with the somewhat obscure characters and comic books to a small degree, although their success rate has been hit and miss; the attempts that worked, and worked very well I might add, were films like \\"Men in Black\\" or the blockbuster \\"300\\"; however, the ones that missed seemed to strike out just as massively as the others had succeeded, examples would be \\"Elektra\\", the spin-off from \\"Daredevil\\" and \\"Zoom: Academy for Superheroes\\". The appeal for movie studios to adapt more unknown titles would seem a somewhat risky proposition, but Universal had found great success with their gamble on `Hellboy', so perhaps their confidence was a bit stronger than most. Which brings us to Universal's most recent film adaptation based on a lesser-known comic book, the critically praised and fan boy approved, hard-edged and extremely violent \\"Wanted\\" based on Mark Millar's comic book miniseries of the same name.    \\"Wanted\\" is the story of a weak-willed accountant named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), who lives an unenviable life where his girlfriend cheats on him, his boss verbally abuses him, and essentially everyone around him does nothing but take advantage of him every minute of his life. One moment everything in his life seems to be as mundane as ever, until a sexy woman by the name of Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from a would-be assassin and his routinely boring life. Now, Wesley is offered the chance of a lifetime from a mysterious man named Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who leads a group of assassins called The Fraternity, to embrace his hidden killer instinct and become the assassin he was destined to be.    With Hollywood's successful comic book adaptations it seems a good rule of thumb would be to retain as much of the source material as possible, or else the comic fan base will turn on the property faster than you'd believe. Generally, I completely agree with the rule of staying true to the comic book material, and almost every single time an adaptation strays too far from its origins the movie flops massively; however, with \\"Wanted\\" I would have to be cliché in saying that sometimes rules are made to be broken. Helmed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov making his American directorial debut, and written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas (writers of \\"3:10 to Yuma\\"), along with Chris Morgan (\\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\"), \\"Wanted\\" loosely follows the storyline of the comic book miniseries written by acclaimed writer Mark Millar. The movie changes some of the characters from the miniseries, removes all of the costumes (aside from some subtle nods with Angelina Jolie's leather attire), along with the notion that superheroes and villains existed at one point but no longer; however, with all these changes being made from the source material, series creator Mark Millar was still in approval of the production, even acknowledging his own wish to have removed the costumes from the comic book, though he never got around to it.    The screenplay is a mixture of reality based and somewhat science-fiction tinged dialogue and mind-bending action sequences, mixed with an interesting approach to the concept of predestination, all fitting perfectly together for a film in the vein of \\"The Matrix\\". The story is extremely fast-paced, providing a semi-origin tale that takes the traditional origin sequences and puts its own spin on them, along with some truly innovative special effects sequences, and enough action set pieces to satisfy even the most ardent of action junkies. The characters are not the deepest you'll find in a movie, comic book or otherwise, but there's enough development sprinkled throughout to keep each character interesting for the audience, and not leave them waiting impatiently for the next fight to occur.    After so many CGI-intensive movies being released year after year, enabling directors and their special effects wizards to create virtually anything their imaginations can conceive of, it is surprising to me to still be able to watch a movie that manages to achieve some originality in the realm of CGI and action sequences. I thought I had seen almost anything that Hollywood could come up with by this point, but director Timur Bekmambetov and his team of creative special effects masters have crafted a truly awesome visual experience that will leave you saying, \\"Wow, I have never seen that before!\\" For some, \\"Wanted\\" seemed to be the movie that the two `Matrix' sequels (especially the final one, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\") should have been. I for one enjoyed the two `Matrix' sequels, but that's for another time, either way \\"Wanted\\" is definitely a movie that is just as innovative in its presentation as anything found in `The Matrix' trilogy. Although the storyline isn't nearly as deep or complicated, or even confusing in some spots, as `The Matrix' trilogy, I believe \\"Wanted\\" is still just as much of a fun and entertaining experience as the former.    Of course, the success of this movie wouldn't be possible without the terrific work done by the three leads in the movie, James McAvoy (\\"Atonement\\"), Angelina Jolie (\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\"), and Morgan Freeman (\\"The Dark Knight\\"). It is a testament to the talent of these superstars to be able to give credibility, and even some depth to such a far-fetched story, and still be able to walk away with their respect intact and their \\"cool\\" factor definitely through the roof. Anybody that has seen any of James McAvoy's previous films will no doubt be surprised by not only his choice of signing on to a movie such as this, but also by the fact that he pulls off the role of an action hero surprisingly well. Angelina Jolieis no stranger to action heroines due to her successful turns in the `Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' movies and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\", though lately she has done more serious dramatic acting, it was nice to see her cut loose once again and still look just as good doing it as she ever did. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman is another big surprise to find in this movie, sure he's done the last two `Batman' films, but this role comes much more out of left field than any of his previous work, yet he still gives a great performance. On a side note, there is something strangely humorous about hearing Morgan Freeman channel his inner Samuel L. Jackson at one point in this film.    \\"Wanted\\" is by far one of the most visually impressive action films you will ever see, with an interesting story that moves at break neck speed, but doesn't allow for a whole lot of character development, although you don't really miss it. The movie is extremely violent and proud of it I might add, approaching the action genre with a boldness to push itself hard into an R rating, a move that many films (action or otherwise) seem afraid to do here lately.    \\"Wanted\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Three years ago, director Christopher Nolan (\\"The Prestige\\") successfully resurrected the `Batman' franchise after its unfortunate demise at the hands of Joel Schumacher (\\"Batman Forever\\" & \\"Batman & Robin\\"). Nolan's vision for Gotham City's dark hero was grounded in a more realistic world than the previous four movies had been, gone was the camp and unnecessary nipples on the batsuit from Schumacher's version, and in was an authentic, true to the comic book interpretation of the brooding hero, complete with darker villains, much more realistic weapons and gadgets, and some of the best acting and storytelling of any of the Bat's incarnations this side of its comic book origins. After \\"Batman Begins\\" sustained a solid run at the box office and on DVD, fans eagerly awaited to see just what this new franchise would do with the story that was setup in the final moments of `Begins' when Lt. Gordon showed Batman the Joker card. Now, here we are in 2008, and the anxiously anticipated sequel has been released and let me tell you \\"The Dark Knight\\" definitely delivers, successfully building upon the outstanding groundwork that had been laid by \\"Batman Begins\\" and going beyond my own, and many others, expectations to create an awesome experience at the movies.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" picks up sometime after the events depicted in the previous film, as Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing his crusade to take back Gotham City from the evil, corrupt men that have held sway over it for so long. Assisting Batman in his fight for justice are his trusted allies Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), his former love and Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhall), his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his tech supplier Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and a newly appointed District Attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). With as much help and support as Batman is getting in his quest, it would seem that victory over the forces of darkness may actually be possible; however, a new evil is emerging in the form of the maniacal Joker (Heath Ledger). A twisted man with the simplest of intentions, to plunge Gotham City into complete and utter chaos, and God be with anyone that gets in his way. As this new threat tests the limits of not only Batman, but the very citizens of Gotham City, it seems that perhaps evil may finally have the last laugh.    Wow. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is one of the best comic book inspired movies ever put in front of a camera; in fact calling it a comic book movie is almost inaccurate as this movie has more in common with a crime thriller than your standard comic book film. Sure, the movie features characters that are somewhat larger than life, and the main character dresses himself up in a batsuit; but the storytelling is done in such a realistic fashion that it allows the movie to transcend the barriers that typically surround the traditional comic book movie. Gaining respect and acclaim from critics all throughout Hollywood, a new concept for most comic book inspired creations, \\"The Dark Knight\\" may possibly be the first of its kind to be viewed more as a respected mainstream action/drama than just another comic book movie.    The screenplay for \\"The Dark Knight\\" as crafted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on a story by Christopher and David S. Goyer (writer of the `Blade' franchise), is an excellent follow-up to the terrific work this team of talented individuals had done with \\"Batman Begins\\". The story is so full of intensity, twists and turns, and a hefty dose of the unexpected, that you really need to see the movie more than once in order to fully appreciate all of the various elements that comprise this entertaining slice of pop culture. The story for \\"Batman Begins\\" was focused primarily on the origin of Batman and his initial appearances in Gotham City, with \\"The Dark Knight\\" the story focuses much more on the escalation of evil around the city that has been inadvertently caused by Batman's continuing quest for justice. This shift in focus allows the movie to become much darker than the previous one, and more of a character study as each of the characters, primarily the hero, are forced to take a good look at themselves and what his or her actions may be having on the increased problems plaguing the city, and whether their contributions are worth the price or not.    The talented cast assembled for this movie is such an incredible ensemble of Hollywood's A-list that it's amazing the story was capable of giving the appropriate amount of attention to them all without some getting lost in the shuffle. Christian Bale delivers what is easily the best portrayal of the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman, expertly playing the opposing nature the character has with his playboy lifestyle as Bruce Wayne, compared to the intensity and violence that consumes his life as the Batman. Matching wits with Batman this time around is the maniacal Joker, played to cackling perfection by the late Heath Ledger (\\"A Knight's Tale\\"). Heath's performance as the Joker is by far the definitive version of the character outside of the comic books, making all others that have played him pale in comparison. From every facial tick, to the trademark laugh, to his odd pattern of speech, everything about this character is spot on; and Heath has masterfully created one of the most iconic villainous performances in modern cinema, that it may even rival Anthony Hopkin's chilling creation of Hannibal Lecter in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\". Supporting the two lead actors, if you can truly call them that, as the story gives equal time to almost every one of the primary characters, are returning cast members Gary Oldman, who gets to do so much more with Jim Gordon than he was able to in \\"Batman Begins\\", Michael Caine (\\"Secondhand Lions\\") as trusted butler Alfred, who provides the unwavering support that Batman needs in his continuing war on crime, and Morgan Freeman returning as Lucius Fox, the man that provides all the necessary technology that Batman needs to take back the streets of Gotham City. Joining the series for the first time is actor Aaron Eckhart (\\"No Reservations\\") as Harvey Dent, a man who has a thirst for justice almost as intense as Batman's, although his methods are more by the book than the Bat's; and actress Maggie Gyllenhall (\\"World Trade Center\\") replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, a former love of Bruce Wayne's and assistant D.A. to Harvey Dent. This time Rachel is given much more screen time, and a more fleshed out story than she previously had in \\"Batman Begins\\", which is probably a testament to Maggie Gyllenhall being a somewhat better actress than Katie Holmes, not to mention she doesn't come with the baggage that is Tom Cruise.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is, as I said earlier, one of the best comic book adaptations, if not the best (in my opinion), and may also be viewed as more of a crime thriller than a comic book movie. Comprised of intense storytelling (much more so than any of its predecessors), excellent acting, white knuckle action sequences, and numerous twists, turns, and surprises that will leave you begging for more as the credits begin to roll.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.

0307383415|5.0|President-elect Obama writes as well as he speaks.  This book helps us to understand his background and is a must-read for all who would like to know more about Barack Obama, his values and dreams.  I was touched by his note on his Mother in the Preface to the 2004 edition.
B001LRG4EW|5.0|Kate Morton gives us another in what is becoming her niche; she offers a mystery told from three different points in time, and only in the last 50 pages or so does she tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />In 1913, a little girl is found all by herself after a ship docks in Australia.  She has nobody waiting for her and no history that can be discerned.  In 1975, she finds a few more pieces of the puzzle, and in 2005 her granddaughter Cassandra finally solves the mystery of who Nell was and how she came to be sitting on that little white suitcase on the pier.<br /><br />One of the things I love best about Kate Morton is her ability to surprise me.  I often see plot twists coming from a mile away, and this isn't often true of Ms. Morton's novel.  There was one incident that I could see occurring, but I was still interested in seeing how she would bring it to fruition.<br /><br />My only other quibble, and it's a very minor one, is that the final piece of the mystery is solved accidentally and just a little too tidily.  I did want there to be closure, but it felt just a tad too convenient.  I stress that this is the tiniest of criticisms, given that I loved the book as a whole so much and couldn't turn the pages fast enough in order to find out what would happen next.  I anxiously await anything that Kate Morton does next.
B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly is a very well produced album its Donald Fagen at his best! Every track is great and still gives you that Steely Dan feel.  Tracks have a breezy, summer sound with jazzy overtones, great vocals, great lyrics.  Its one of my favourites!  Sure to put you in a good mood and have you dancing round the living room.
B00005JPCF|1.0|To those who say a PG rating should be enough to warn parents, my daughter loves tap dancing and this film was marketed in such a way as to appear to be \\"harmless fun\\" aimed at little kids.  Fortunately, we only borrowed this movie from the library...but our 4 year old said \\"no - I don't want to watch it - it is too scary!\\"  Turns out she had already seen it in pre-school, and she was right - it is not a movie for young kids.  My wife and I watched it after putting our daughter to bed, and while it might not be too scary for older kids, this is nothing I'd go out of my way to expose my kids to. There are many dark aspects to this film, and we found it a waste of time at best!  If you still want to check it out, save your money and do it at a library instead!
B001B67VR2|5.0|I rate this 5 stars because Rihanna has produced several hit songs off of this one CD.  Upbeat and clubby to smooth and relaxing Rihanna has a CD worthy of buying the full music CD and not just an MP3 download!
B000V6BE6C|5.0|the first thing i heard off this cd was \\"a little piece of heaven\\" and i was just like \\"wtf is this??\\" it sounds like a little bit of system of a down and a lot of theatrical sounding background music that could be on a score to a tim burton flick. i bought the cd after a friend recommended it and i've been hooked on it since. the last cds i listened to this many times the first month i owned them was pearl jam's vs. or pantera's vulgar display of power and they came out a long time ago! this album has that special something that could and should put these guys on the map like they never imagined.<br /><br />the songs are arranged really well. the guitar work is sick. the drumming is awesome. and unlike other cds i've bought recently every song is different. i can listen to the whole cd without skipping a single track. you can hear their influences yet they retain an original sound.<br /><br />don't listen to the haters that bash this cd...give it a shot. if you're hoping for a metalcore/punk cd like these guys started out doing, forget it. if you own their other albums, you already know A7X tends to reinvent their sound a little with every one they release. you can hear a little bit of every previous album's style, yet this one is really different.<br /><br />as for the shmucks that say this is a pro iraq war cd they have no idea what their talking about. if they would just shut their mouths and read the lyrics you can see the band doesn't take a stance for or against the war, they are just giving a sick shoutout to the brave men and women that fight for our freedom. the only thing they bash is people that talk so much smack against the war, they forget to think about the soldiers that die for our freedom and give us the right to have an unfavorable opinion of a war (an action many nations punish their citizens for.) you can see they obviously have people they care about in the service and are dedicating some really good tracks to them.<br /><br />i personally like every song on this album. some more than others, some i loved the first time i heard them and others grew on me. to sum it up, buy this cd!!!more than others, some i loved the first time i heard them and others grew on me. to sum it up, buy this cd!!!
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|It really baffles me why so many people like this album. It's boring, repetitive, dreary and soulless, and most of the songs don't go anywhere. You know, usually when a band takes ten years between albums, it's not a good sign. It's just too bad they didn't quit when they were ahead because their 90s work was great.

B001F7MSG6|3.0|Although we enjoyed the movie, it just wasn't as engaging as the first one.  They were sillier in this one, which is fun, but you weren't drawn in as much - sometimes things can be a little too light hearted.  I probably would've been happy just to have rented the video rather than add it to my collection or at least just got it as a regular dvd rather than blu ray.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|Who is John Adams? That will probably be the reaction of most of my fellow Europeans if you mention America's second president. I'd heard of many of the other figures who drift through this miniseries-- Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington-- but, when I bought this series at the suggetion of an American friend, I had a vague notion that John Adams was the chap who signed his name in huge letters at the top of the Declaration of Independence and said: \\"Well, King George should be able to read that!\\"    Now I know who John Adams was. But I also realise why I'd never heard of him before, and why television has shied away from him until now. He's such a pallid personality that he struggles to remain the focus of his own series. I was more interested in his steely, proto-feminist wife Abigail; in the cynically idealistic Benjamin Franklin, portrayed masterfully by Tom Wilkinson; in Thomas Jefferson, whose reckless devotion to principle is used to symbolise one whole side of the American character. It's only a slight exaggeration to say that what interested me least in \\"John Adams\\" was John Adams himself.    As a portrait of the times, however, the series is much more successful. Unlike many historical dramas, it's less interested in costume and visual splendour than it is in recreating the intellectual climate of the era. Debates in the Continental Congress are not compressed into a few minutes of pithy exchanges, as they would be in many biopics and historical dramas. The great issues of the time are dealt with head-on, rather than being treated as a kind of background music for more personal dramas. This isn't historical drama; it's the drama of history itself.    In the end, the great weakness is John Adams himsef. I reached the last scene of the series without ever really discovering what drove this man, what persuaded his fellow Americans to give him the highest office of their land, or why his story was worthy of so many hours of my attention.This series is a Life and Times where the Life itself is unengaging, but the Times earn four stars on their own, and make this a production well worth watching.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This series has had me hooked since seeing the premier.  The third season, what can I say?  It was short due to the writer's strike but still well worth while.  If you like a taste of the supernatural mixed with guns, attitude, and a whole lot of fun, then try Supernatural and get hooked too.
B0000UJL96|5.0|I'll keep it simple.  The quality is as good as it should be, the second disc has plenty of extras, including Gene Roddenberry's opinion on the film (he died shortly before it was released in theaters).  For the price here at Amazon, it's a must have for any Trek fan!

B0002PUH2Y|5.0|This album is just fantastic; beautiful and full of emotion.  And as Bebe seems to have completely disappeared since releasing it, it's pretty unique, not like any other artist that I know of.
1594201927|3.0|Niall Ferguson is a very polished pop historian, and this book reflects his ease with the subject--not surprisingly, given that he had previously published *The Cash Nexus: Money and Power in the Modern World, 1700-2000* six years earlier. The television series that goes with the book is polished too. For those readers unfamiliar with the story of how various kinds of markets and institutions have evolved, and how they have fed into the current financial crisis and recession, this is an extremely useful primer. It is, however, rather uneven in the level at which it is written, mixing sometimes too glib historical illustrations with occasional jargon that needs more simple explanation. Ferguson can also be overly descriptive and atheoretical at times. But nevertheless that's always the lot of the pop historian, and a book like this is very helpful at the present time and fills an important gap in the market.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Great family movie! The 3D effects were cool! Not the best movie ever but I really liked seeing this with my son and not having to worry about the content!
B00005K9LN|5.0|I've listened Judas Priest since 2006, on our way to Cedar Point of course, Well Judas Priest is a British heavy metal band from the 80's, 90's and so on. Also, it has some really awesome songs like Turbo Lover, Some Heads are Gonna Roll, Living After Midnight, Breaking the Law, and You Got Another Thing Comin'. Well my favorite albums are British Steel, Screaming for Vengence, Turbo, Defenders, etc.    Here is what think about the songs (in all albums):    \\"Breaking the Law\\": *****/*****- classic song to any YouTube video (Beyblade, Battlebots, Robot Wars, etc)    \\"Living After Midnight\\": *****/*****- awesome, very catchy too, it's probably my favorite of the Judas Priest songs, I only listen to this song, when I go to amusement park to watch a roller coaster go into action, and or other events. again, a underrated classic hit and never gets old.  This song is also useful for a Beyblade music video, Now thats what I'm talking about!    \\"Turbo Lover\\": *****/*****: crazy fun, useful for roller coasters going in a fast speed.     \\"Painkiller\\": ****/*****: a little scary, but its still worth listening.     \\"Some Heads are Gonna Roll\\": *****/*****: classic fun, but common to listen, use it anywhere that suits you the most.    \\"You Got Another Thing Comin\\": *****/*****: very cool song, but easy to listen.    Thats all I have to say about this album, classic fun, full of excitement and everything.    One more thing, the name is Zac Ritner (Age 15), not R.Ritner (my username is Beybladefan1615).     Judas Priest (British Steel): 5/5
B000VI6T6U|3.0|Monetery is extremely over rated by fans and critics alike for Jimi.  He was trying to break into America and was showing off, later in concerts like \\"Isle of Wight\\" and \\"Live at the Filmore East\\" Jimi PLAYED!<br />Sure he burns his guitar and smashes it, something he wished he never done because he didnt want to be known as a Pete Townshend, but a serious Guitar player (as Pete is, but hes an entertainer as well).<br />Jimi's show is ok, good tight song list, no real long entended jams as he is known for.

B000VLOKQI|4.0|This couda and shouda been there version of the Beatles Anthology.<br />I love the fact the movie they cuss alot in it. They speak in their common spoken language, being free and real, not made for tv for sure.<br />Its very indepth and compelling as far as the storytelling goes and very enjoyable to watch its first run through, Im not so sure on repeat watches because every F--ing song they fade out 1/3 in, I want to see and hear the song!!!!!!!<br />I mean why they do that?  Whats there hurry??  I have all night to see and enjoy this movie, its made for people WHO have no attention spans.....WHO is to blame?!<br /><br />It really pissed me off to see these RARE original song promos made and directed by Kit Lambert and fade out after 25 seconds.....WHY!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Let me redo this as a \\"special edition: I will re-insert the songs and let it play out, add a few videos along the way, double the length and it will be a masterpiece movie Milestone for this band....until then......go see \\"The Kids are Alright\\".
B00133KFGW|5.0|It is an excellent movie one that I particularly wanted to keep. What surprised me was that the DVD in the case had no markings what so ever. It was a regular unmarked blank that had a very good copy of the movie recorded on it. If it did not come from Amazon I would have assumed it was an illegal copy. I had to identify it with  a marker so it would not get mixed up with my many back up DVD copies of stuff I keep on my computer. Very strange.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This 1979 Documentry is done the old fashion way, let the music and clips do the talking, there is no narrator, a lost art form by today's standard.<br />The film flows very nicely from song to interview back to song, ect.<br />I think the film is a 10, my ONLY gripe is, the film starts with \\"My Generation\\" then progresses nicely up to \\"Who Afre you\\" then for no reason, inserts \\"My Generation\\" from Monterey.  I think the director just wanted to use the clip, because at the time it was unreleased and is shot very nice from D A Pinnebaker.<br />But its an extra song so WHO cares.  It just messes with the flow of the movie, other than that, its fast paced, packed with Full length performances (there is one \\"medley\\" section though).  It shows the amazing video from 1968's Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus \\"A Quick One\\" Many of the interviews are quit humerious.<br />Just a great documentry of the WHO era with Keith Moon.<br />I actauuly thought of making a second volume of material and videos from 1980-present in the same style and format called \\"The Kids are still alight\\", but maybe someone will do it for me someday.<br />Enjoy the Film!
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|[This comment refers to the 25th anniversary edition]    There are, at the time of this writing, 101 reviews of this calculator so I won't go through another detailed one. And I do recommend this HP with one caveat. This calculator is solidly built except for the LCD screen. The LCD, which is not the best I seen,  is covered with a soft, flexible plastic which if pressure is applied could damage the the LCD. Also be warned that this plastic film is very easily scratched and marred, even while in the vinyl case. I recommend the use of a film protector similar to those used on PDAs and perhaps a better, sturdier case.  HP got really cheap here.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The features of this unit are well known and well described both in the manufacturer's promotional materials and other reviews.<br /><br />  My review focuses on only one aspect: Sony's self-destructive exploitation of its customer base.<br /><br />  Imagine paying nearly $50 for a game controller which contains a battery rechargeable only through a mini-USB port.<br /><br />  Now imagine a manufacturer so grasping, so greedy that they don't include a charging cable in the package with this $50 controller.<br /><br />  Imagine all that and you have the one of the answers to why, with its vastly superior technology, Sony's Playstation 3 is a distant third in the game console market.<br /><br />  Customers really don't like to be gouged.<br /><br />  Almost $50 for a game controller with no truly outstanding features, a controller that requires a cable for recharging. A cable that would cost Sony only pennies . . . and they don't include it because they want to extract a few more dollars from their customers.<br /><br />  I bought the Playstation 3 for the grandkids. I justified it in part by telling myself I was getting a BluRay player with an inexpensive game console thrown in.<br /><br />  Nope. The reality is that Sony thinks I held up my hand and said \\"Hey, gouge me!\\" Wrong. I think I see an Xbox or Wii in my grandchildren's future. Neither company is as greedy as Sony. Like I said, it is no surprise that Sony is a very distant third in this market, even though the Playstation 3 technology is superior.<br /><br />Jerry
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is the best 'authentic' Wagner 'Ring' on DVD.  It follows, very closely, Wagner's own staging instructions and is a wonderful representation of the Norse gods mythology.  It definitely is the first 'Ring' for everyone to own--after all, the set of 4 operas is about the Norse gods and Norse mythology, not about modern power dams!  My quibbles with it are few;  however, the following are worth mentioning:  1. It doesn't have Fricka arriving in 'Die Walküre', Act 2, Scene 1, in a cart (or wagon) drawn by two rams.  Brünnhilde sings about this when she warns Wotan that Fricka is approaching (and, Fricka is a very mad wife--she doesn't appear as irritated as she is without the cart).  2. 'Die Walküre', Act 3, Scene 2, has no horses for the Valkyries.  3. 'Götterdämmerung', Act 3, Scene 3 (the final scene), Brünnhilde does not have her horse 'Grane' when she rides into the flames.  In regards 1 above--it is just a pity this was not done per Wagner's stage instructions which are in the libretto.  In regards 2 above--it is another pity that Wagner's stage instructions were not followed.  The Seattle Opera, a few years ago, managed to have flying horses complete with Valkyries upon them.  If the Seattle Opera can manage to do this sort of thing, so can the Met!  In regards 3 above--it is yet again another pity that Wagner's stage instructions were not followed.  These instructions state: 'Brünnhilde jumps on her horse (Grane) and with one bound leaps into the burning pyre (Sigfried's funeral pyre').  I realize there are certain problems with having a live horse on stage;  mostly problems with the horse dropping little gifts on stage or wetting up the stage.  However, these problems could easily be solved by having a mannequin horse animated by two members of the ballet troupe as was done in the Komiche Opera's 1984 Berlin production of Handel's Giustino.  (This was spectacular, with Jochen Kowalski in one of his greatest performances.  It was released on LD, buthas not yet, to my knowledge been released on DVD.)
B001F7MSG6|2.0|The first movie had a great balance of character development and creepiness to the mythos. This movie is very pretty (like an anime) but didn't have any pseudo-horror vibe like the first movie. Cthulhu was missing very much in this movie. I found it to be a trite piece of pretty fluff.<br /><br />I hope they do more Hellboys - but they need to be darker and less pretty.

B001ACH4DS|1.0|... all the songs sound the same! They start of melodic enough and then Cook starts screaming and yelling. It gets so bad that in some of the tracks his voice sounds strained and cracked. STOP IT! Not a single track is memorable. The shame of it is that Cook had gotten a shot due to his appearance on Idol and then he delivers this noisy, boring and irritating conglomeration. Save your money folks, but if you have to have this mess, wait for it to be in the bargain bin ... it won't be long. The other option is to buy it for a buck on eBay ... plenty of folks are dumping this piece o' .... there!
B001F12J3Y|3.0|The movie is great, however the 3d version is not the greatest. I have found that the 3d version of \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" for home release had much better 3d effect. The Polar Express had double images and other weired effects. The cardboard glasses are not the most comfortable thing to wear. The plastic glasses you get when you go to the theater are much better.  To get the best effect for 3D at home you need to have your viewing room dark and the TV set to Standard mode not movie mode.
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|I am new to Shinedown, and bought this after listening to one song on the radio a lot, and then watching some tracks on uTube. I love this album. Even my wife loves it, which surprised me, I don't know why. I like listening to a wide range of music from heavy metal to classical, and this is just the thing to listen to when I don't want anything else. It is just hard enough, but has a classic rock sound I love.

0679737456|1.0|Lorene Carey's book, left alot to be desired. THe racism inside of the pages is either subtle or seemingly imaginary. I beleive she did experience racism, however not to the degree of less fortunate African Americans. Little things to do with racism that could have been mistakenly perceived are what she concentrates and is enraged about more so then her rape. Though her rape was under odd circumstances she doesnt seem bothered by it as much as things that should have held less pain from.
B000GY729M|2.0|... Then why are you asking yourself the question? Good grief, what awful lyrics festoon this album. Everything in \\"Sam's Town\\" seems to sound clumsy and forced, and none of the songs are actually *about* anything. This CD must have been a huge disappointment for fans of \\"Hot Fuss\\", the terrific debut album which made an instant success of an apparently talented band not afraid to use keyboard sounds from a long-dead era.    Indeed, a friend and I were who were huge fans of \\"Hot Fuss\\" were really looking forward to this album when it came out. But when we listened to it, we both agreed: it was hopelessly mediocre. It was as though the Killers, after one big success, literally had no idea what to do next. I imagine that other fans felt the same way. And I can believe that the absence of a resultant dip in The Killer's popularity is simply owing to the fact that a huge body of \\"Hot fuss\\" fans have been displaced by people whose musical tastes are about a notch above the Kylie / Britney scene.    The melodies herein are so-so; but the major problem is the lyrics. They are completely artificial. Very often Brandon Flowers sings them with awkward vocal inflections and palpably no conviction, as though he is literally unable to believe what he's saying. Which is hardly surprising when you consider lines such as:    \\"He doesn't look a thing like Jesus  But he talks like a gentleman\\"    Really? What girl, pondering her blind date, has ever lamented that he doesn't look a thing like Jesus? Who exactly do the Killers think they're kidding? On and on the album goes like this, for song after disappointing song.     This album is a crying shame: some bands start have an awkward start with great potential, then that potential blossoms in the next album. The Killers, by contrast, had the perfect start and then went on to produce ... this.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|If you have played the game Risk, then you will see the similarities between that game and this one.  However, Catan is set in an agrarian society, and, as such, may appeal more to families.  It is rarely \\"violent,\\" although your fellow game players may be tempted to throttle you should you place the Robber Baron on their property.<br /><br />Contrary to the box's assertion, this game is not easily learned in 15 minutes.  It is one that you really need to play repeatedly and fairly frequently in order to fully enjoy.  The learning experience is much more enjoyable if you are able to play with experienced Catan players.  One caveat, if you are playing with a \\"shady\\" character - beware their advice, they are probably setting you up to their advantage!<br /><br />Almost anyone will enjoy this game.  We have played with our daughter and her husband; they frequently play with their pastor and his wife.  Our nephews (13 and 15) loved playing this and have requested it for Christmas.  Quite a feat when you consider they are serious video-gamers!<br /><br />On a personal note, I have noticed that individuals who are engineers or pilots tend to do better at playing the game overall.  They seem to be able to view the game in total, taking in the \\"big picture,\\" rather than focusing on separate distinct parts.  Individuals, who are not spatially oriented or have more of an artistic penchant, enjoy the game, but not to the extent that more technically oriented players seem to.<br /><br />We bought the fourth edition because there were no more third editions available.  The quality has definitely deteriorated; the card stock is thinner, and the dice seem to roll 7's much more frequently than is statistically probable.  If the second set we purchased for friends has the same characteristic, we are going to replace the dice.  On the other hand, the interlocking border is a welcome addition, and we had no trouble connecting the pieces.<br /><br />I rated this item as four stars rather than five because it is not universally appealing and because it does take some time to learn to play.sally appealing and because it does take some time to learn to play.
B0002858YS|5.0|I've never had the experience before of standing in a record store, hearing a song being played, going straight to the counter to find out what it was, and then buying the album within minutes. But that's the effect that the song \\"Mr. Brightside\\" had on me while I was in Red Eye records in Sydney one Saturday. It was probably the best song of the year. I play it to this day. And I'm no impulse-buyer.    It really needs to be remembered what a great album this is: lyrically, there is scarcely a faltering step on it; never a boring moment; and some of the songs which were not released as singles deserved to be. \\"Glamourous Indie Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Believe me Natalie\\" are so redolent of an indescribable time and/or feeling that they will probably still be playable many years from now.    The Killers made the unusual choice of using keyboards extensively on some of these songs, which, in a more mediocre band, might have made them sound as cheesy as a throwback to bad '80s stuff. But they have somehow retained both a fun 'pop' sound and their Indie street cred at the same time. It's an unusual combination, and the jewel in the crown of what must be one of the great debut albums.

B00158K0S8|5.0|George C. Scott and all the other actors put on a great performance.  This movie is well directed and edited and deserves to be in the top 100 movies of all time.  Although it strays from the truth occasionally about the real Patton, as a myth maker the movie is superb. This movie script is what put Spielberg into the big leagues as far as movie making goes. The best thing about it is the nuances and complexity of the Patton character, it belies the stereotyping usually given to military types as depicted by Hollywood.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|This movie wasn't bad but it was hardly the movie that you would want to see Deniro and Pacino wait so long to share screen time on. It was a pretty basic police/serial killer story that tried to keep you guessing but really has been done before. I would rather have seen them sink their teeth into something worthy of their early efforts and all we got was something that was worthy of their latest efforts which haven't been all that great. The movie had a really good cast and Carla Gugino looked great and super sexy as usual.<br /><br />It is worth a watch but if you are expecting The Deer Hunter, Serpico, The Godfather I or II or any other number of great films these guys have done including Heat you will be let down. It is a walk thru performance by both.
0316035904|4.0|This is an updated collection which contains some previously-released works and some new stories.  It was actually all new to me, as this was the first time I've ever read anything by author David Sedaris, although his reputation certainly preceded him.  Overall, I definitely enjoyed his cynical, wry humor.<br /><br />I think Sedaris was most successful here in his more autobiographical stories (I'm assuming that these were somewhat true yet highly embellished).  The chronicle which opens the book, \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" was by far my favorite; this is Sedaris's description of working as Santa's elf for a major department store during the holiday season.  Some of the other true tales weave in favorite odd moments from Sedaris's childhood.  The fictional stories, on the other hand, tend to be way over-the-top, with almost a surreal aspect to them.  However, I thought that the best of these was \\"Seasons Greetings,\\" about a holiday newsletter that truly tells all.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these stories for fans of Sedaris and lovers of off-beat Christmas stories.  If you are in the latter group, you might also like Maeve Binchy's This Year It Will Be Different and another collection by various authors, The Worst Noel.  Merry Christmas!
B00005MM67|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and I must say I didn't expect much. But once I watched it I realized that it was a very serious and very realistic mountain climbing movie. Sure there was a little drama at the beginning involving the one guys wife but I am sure that this exact coversation has happened on a lot of occassions (check out the Everest TV show). But the climbing, the situations, the photography and everything in between is top notch. Recommended to not only fans of and climbers themselves but anybody who likes a good supsenseful action packed movie.
0141023570|5.0|One of the common themes in my top five books is loyalty.  Looking at my own life experiences I can see why I am drawn to stories that honor loyalty.  Steinbeck's character George remains committed to Lennie despite all the trouble and hardships he causes. I absolutely love the dream that George and Lennie share and talk about as they work to achieve it. To quote one of my favorite films RUDY, \\"Dreams are what make life tolerable.\\"  Their little farm dream will always be a vivid picture in my mind.  Overcoming obstacles, dreaming big, working hard, and being sensitive to those who are disadvantaged have always been important trheads in my life, and these elements are the crux of John Steinbeck's classic. I often used this book as a \\"Read Aloud\\" to my freshmen English studensts.  I hope they loved hearing my George and Lennie voices as much as I loved creating them. Their voices will always be in my head and will remind me that when it comes to dealing with life's adversity, it's always better to have someone to share your experiences with, especially the most difficult ones. This book will always remain in my TOP FIVE.
0316067601|5.0|I could not put this wonderfully written book down. If there is such a thing as a page turner, this is it. Heroism drips from these pages. May God Bless these brave men the rest of their lives. I just read and loved a WWII memoir that I highly recommend [[ASIN:1932172319 Walking Through Fire, An Iwo Jima Survivor's Remembrance]]
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I had always been a late entrant to the Bourne films, beginning with the reason that it was just a little hard for me to see Matt Damon doing roundhouse kicks and taking down bad guys.  Much to my surprise, The Bourne Identity, and even more so The Bourne Supremacy, were excellent films that excelled in terms of espionage action, and introduced those unfamiliar with Robert Ludlum's novels to a character that was more interesting and dangerous than even James Bond had been over the past few years prior.  The Bourne Ultimatum rounds out the trilogy, with the amnesiac Jason Bourne bringing the search for his true identity to a close.  Just like director Paul Greengrass had done with the last installment, he manages to weave in so much frentic action that it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  Combined with the intricate plot that brings together all the elements of the previous films as well, the film is indeed a homecoming for Jason Bourne.  Damon is perfect as ever in the role, and with returning cast members Joan Allen and Julia Stiles to go along with new additions David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, and Albert Finney as the man who holds all the keys to Bourne's past; everything indeed comes full circle.  All in all, if you've missed out on the Bourne series at all, you truly have been missing out on something very special.
0143038419|1.0|Seriously Elizabeth Gilbert? You should be ashamed of yourself, ASHAMED. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I am Indonesian and thought I should read it because a third of it takes place in Bali.    The beginning was insanely annoying, Rome was kind of fun- the food, the wine etc. Her time at the Ashram was insanely aggravating. How can you be so selfish and conceited when in a place of such spiritual beauty. I'm seriously SAD that she got the chance to do these wonderful things because she obviously did not appreciate one second of it- or at least is completely  unable to write thoughtfully about her experiences.    And then there's the Bali section! First, she spelled Denpasar incorrectly... If you're going to write about a place- KNOW HOW TO SPELL IT, jesus christ. It is the biggest city in Bali and the city where the Bali airport is and she misspells it? I was embarrassed for her.     And she goes to Ubud, one of the most beautiful places on the island, meets a wonderful medicine man and a best Indonesian friend- how can such a stupid woman get so lucky? It's sad. Then she meets some man, with little to no substance [in the book, not in real life- I hope] and the only thing she can talk about is the sex. Really? You left two beautiful Balinese friends and got completely wrapped up in some dumb sex crazed midlife crisis? Are you dense? And then she goes on to talk about how she is so in tune with the culture- she now knows the whole history and understands the people of Bali... it's aggravating.    Get over yourself, and go back to New York where you belong, please leave Rome, India AND especially Bali alone. They don't need your ridiculousness.
0767817486|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  I remember seeing it when it came out in the 70's and it is every bit as good now as it was then.  A true story and a very upsetting one until finally Billy Hayes gets out of this turkish prison.  He gets caught smuggling drugs and the story from that moment on is unbelievable, intense.  A well done movie to put you into the setting and feel for how horrible it was to be stuck in a foreign country without the help of your home country being able to help.  A good one even if you have already seen it.  Enjoy!!
B001F7MSG6|1.0|Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.    The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|David Cook was the only singer I voted for during the 2007 American Idol show.  I couldn't wait for his debut CD to hit the stores and was first in line to buy one.  Admittedly, I was quite disappointed that he did not include a few ballads which he is fantastic at singing.  I think the older women fell in love with him when he performed \\"The Frist Time I Saw Your Face\\" and \\"Billy Jean\\" on AI.  I missed those type of songs on his CD.  I hope his next one will include some ballads.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Perfect service. I ordered and paid for this item the same day and it was at my house within the next three days. Mint condition. Thank you!
B000TGCR38|4.0|This is an excellent film, taking place in Holland in the closing days of WWII it shows the chaos, betrayal, and desperation in the waning hours of the war.  Well shot, acted,  and with a view from the European occupied view this film is a must see.
B00005JPTK|4.0|I could get up and do the dishes. I could...but the dog, Samantha, she's stealing the movie so far. She's so cute and I love dogs. I do want to see what happens to the dog. Oh, and now there's a flashback...seems like some sort 'Omega Man' type thing going on. There's vicious rats that I'll probably have nightmares about tonight and omigod, the monsters are for reals, very scary. Um, did I mention the freakin' car? Any gearhead worth her spit will get off on the 2007 Shelby Mustang GT500 as it literally destroys the streets of Manhattan, even if it is CGI. It's still a dream come true. Good story telling, escapism, and, in my opinion, the best actor of my generation, Will Smith. And definatly the best car. The dishes will have to wait.
1607960001|5.0|I first read about The Elements of Style in Stephen King's On Writing (which I highly recommend).  King recommended The Elements of Style as the last word on the rules of writing. He was correct.<br /><br />The book is short, concise, and answers any writing issue you may have.  I noticed a significant improvement in my writing after using it as a reference manual.<br /><br />Whether you are a writer, editor, student, or blogger keep it next to you while you're writing!<br /><br />-Jenn Astle
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|Look, I'm here to help you. Hopefully, you'll read this review before the Holidays and you'll buy or rent something worthy of your friends and family to view, something like Sin City or Death Proof but please God, not Mamma Mia. This film is so bad that the people who didn't walk out after 15 minutes decided it was better to just make fun of it by making inappropriate and often times hilarious comments throughout. There's you're warning. Now if you're still intent on seeing this film because Meryl Streep is in it, I want you to remember one thing. This is the same woman who made She-Devil with Roseanne Bar in 1989. Save yourselves.   Your welcome.
B000GPIPD8|4.0|With the release of this year's \\"Attack and Release,\\"  The Black Keys carved out a unique niche in the history of Rock n' Roll.  In a year marked by more hype than usual - Wal-Mart's \\"Rock N Roll Train\\" and Best Buy's \\"Chinese Democracy\\" top the list - true rock n' rollers can take comfort in the Black Keys.  \\"Magic Potion\\"  their 2006 release, summarizes their earlier CD's and provides a glimpse into the evolution of the 2008 Keys.       The title itself tells listeners what to expect.  As it spun in my CD player, I came to realize that R & R is not by any means dead.  No \\"wanna be\\" tunes in this collection.  Rather, the music here is certainly the magic potion that has been sadly missing from the over-produced, over compressed and poorly sequenced pablum that the R & R faithful have endured since the death of Grunge (in itself an overblown style that was better than nothing).  From \\"Just Got To Be,\\" the album's opening track to \\"Elevator,\\" the last track, the fun and excitement don't let up.  No filler here.  Instead, a collection of songs that I guarantee will leave the listner satisfied and wanting more.  Thank the gods that there are several Black Keys CD's out there.  So buy it - don't burn it.  Keep the rock n' roll spirit alive.  The Black Keys do it in a no holds barred way.  Enjoy!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is the DVD by which all other concert DVDs should be based. I saw this set earlier in the tour and it represents everything this show was and more. The sound, camera work and artistry of Rush is second to none. If you are diehard fan or just a casual one this DVD is worth every penny!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Even though there is alot of Hollywood in this movie there is alot of truth to it.  I learned alot by watching it - history repeats itself in a way.
B00061HJ4S|5.0|I love Tamiya models they find the right spot of easy to build while still having a good amount of challegen to them.  This is a great model of a German 88.  The only problem I have with it is the men keep falling over.  But beyond that its a great models.  Keep in mind this is not a toy.  You have to put it togeother yourself and paint it yourself.  If you like that.  You can never good wrong with a Tamiya model.
0307383415|4.0|This book is a good read. It gives a good picture of what makes Barack Obama so appealing. It lists all his struggles and triumphs of his finding out where he fits in the world. I really enjoyed it. It helps you appreciate where he comes from and why he is so fair minded and inclusive.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|As I am a loyal fan of Loreena Mckennitt. So I was not regret to bought her CD when I saw this.  And the result is four thumbs up !!!  All songs in this album are well recorded, smooth and enjoy.  Now I am drinking 4 bottles of beer and enjoy listen to her musics repeatly... indeed wonderful music.
0240810554|5.0|It's hard to believe this book gets even better in this, it's Third Edition.  Author/Editor/Compiler Anchell, himself an outstanding photographer and gifted teacher, gives the reader a no-nonsense, hands-on approach to every necessary aspect of the craft of darkroom photography.  Whether noobie or aging \\"darkroom rat\\" (like this reviewer) this trove of information about photo chemistry, developing and printing techniques, and darkroom lore should be an essential in every non-digital photographer's book shelf.

B000001GBJ|5.0|The children insist on going to sleep with this every night! Great for therapists to use during treatment to encourage relaxation.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|I just came from the theater where my daughter and I saw this movie and it is everything everyone has said about it, it is a great, suspensful, dramatic movie that draws one into it's gripping tale and doesn't let go. During the movie, I began to think \\"This is more than I thought it would be.\\" Don't be fooled. It's not a comedy.<br /><br />As I type, there are only 3 reviews that give it 4 stars, everyone else gave 5 stars. There are no reviews giving less than 4. Of the 3 who gave 4 stars, 2 were full of lavish praise, and only one had anything negative at all to say, and that was that the ending was \\"too upbeat.\\" I for one, like happy endings, although this one might be called bittersweet, not to give too much away. But we didn't know what the ending would be until it happened which finally untied the knots in our stomachs. We thought we had an idea, but weren't sure.  This is one of those movies that makes such an impression on you, that you keep talking about for some time after you leave the theater. That hasn't happened to me in a long time.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|I loved it.. as good as the first movie  I did cringe a little with the drunken singing, was it Barry Manilow ?? eek.   Other than that this movie exceeded my expectations and looked fabulous on blu ray..    True, this movie does seem to take alot of ideas from the Men In Black movies, but I happen to love MIB 1&2 so I was ok with that.  I hope we get a HELLBOY 3 !    I just watched  part 1 and part 2 in 1 sitting and it was a great afternoon of movies.   I highly recommed this movie. YOu might want to mute the volume at the end with the Barry Manilow again.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I first saw the dvd's at a friends.  I enjoyed them so much I purchase them for myself about 3 months ago and just purchased another set to give my Dad for Christmas.  The photography is amazing!!
0385340990|5.0|So much has been written about this charming title already that I'll just add a few thoughts to the chorus.  Fist of all, this book is absolutely charming. I picked up one for my mother for Christmas and \\"pre-read\\" it this week.  I'll be heading out this weekend to pick up more copies - it's that perfect a gift for anyone who loves the written word. Don't miss this one!
B001ECQ75A|2.0|We saw this movie in the theatre.  It was a cute movie, but a rental or even a purchase (from Amazon of coarse) is a better way to see it.    It was a very long movie for a 3-5 yr old to sit through.  But it is very cute especially if your child likes Karate.  The nemesis character is a little scary but not terrifying.  My little one just couldn't sit through it all.  Not Amazon's fault just a product of the movie.    We bought it to add to our collection not because we loved it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time just got better. (Better picture quality.) I'm teaching an Introduction to Film class next semester and each week we'll be discussing a different topic in film studies--photography, editing, sound, acting, drama. I'll be using this film to illustrate every single topic, b/c it literally is like a textbook on \\"how to make a film.\\" I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this movie made me into a lifelong fan of film-making. The question of how Kurosawa created a timeless epic out of a gang of misfit samurai takes at least a lifetime to figure out. Needless to say, most of the remakes and knockoffs of this movie pale in comparison. You can't improve on a classic. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. If you haven't seen \\"Seven Samurai\\", you don't know squat about films.
0743298039|5.0|I have only read one other book that has grabbed me so completely after just reading a few sentences. The Thirteenth Tale was gorgeously-written, rich with vivid detail and suspense. I think this book will appeal to a wide audience. Those that love books, history, literature, and mystery novels. The Thirteenth Tale has it all.    I'll sum up the plot a little without giving away any spoilers. So if you haven't read it yet, feel free to keep reading. The story begins when Margaret Lea, a biographer receives a letter from one of England's most renown authors, the elusive Vida Winters. Mrs Winters has given nineteen different versions of her life. Margaret, who only writes biographies on long forgotten historical figures has qualms about writing a biography on a living person. However, Margaret agrees to meet Mrs Winters at her home.     The woman that Margaret meets, however, is as elusive as her writing. The author admits that every detail of her life that she has given to biographers has been a lie to protect her past. \\"Do you believe in ghosts?\\" Vida asks. Margaret decides she can proceed no further. As she is walking away from the author and her offer,  Vida Winters touches on a subject that is so personal and secret to Margaret that she freezes. She stays and Vida Winters begins telling Margaret the tragic story of two unfortunate twins, Emmeline and Adeline.     Upon reading this book, I had a few preconceived notions. As I started reading, I thought I knew the direction the story was taking. At times I thought I had figured out all the mysteries. I was wrong every time. This book is original in every way.     The Thirteenth Tale will be one of those books I will read and reread through the years. I envy those that will soon read it for the first time. I read this novel in one day. Take your time with it and enjoy it. Savor every sentence because books like this don't come around every day

B001NB6IN8|5.0|Fall out boy never ceases to amaze me. I truly think this is their best album yet, and I've been a fan since take this to your grave. I'm sick of hearing people say they've sold out or are changing, because that's what bands do. That's what everyone does, and you have to get used to it.   How can you expect them to write the same kind of stuff they made years ago? You'd get bored with that and complain that they haven changed.   All I'm saying is give folie a deux and try and don't think of it as a crappy excuse for an album...because true fall out boy fans will love it.
0920668364|5.0|I'd seen this book in softcover many times but never in hardback. This is the most touching and wonderful book I have ever read in children's books. I have 2 small girls and we have read it many times. I made a song from the part - I Love You For Ever. The girls sing - You'll be my Mommy until the end of time! TOUCHING!! Thank You for the Hardcover Gift Book in larger size and brighter pictures! We love it!
076781326X|4.0|Dickens has written many stories which consist of many characters, almost too many to care, and several storylines which intersect at the end.  The Twist story has been simplified in order to make room for great musical tunes and staging.  The songs are memorable, especially 'Consider yourself', 'Food glorious food'.  Lester is adorable and Fagin and the ARtful Dodger are memorable characters.  There is violence and a scary character named Bill Sikes, so those with very young children, beware.  For others it is the perfect musical.
0618918248|5.0|I strongly suspect that any single book, unless it carries \\"higher\\" authority, isn't going to convince anyone to switch their religious preference. That said, the God Delusion was actually pretty good as just reading material. It makes a valid statement, namely that while no one can ever prove God's existence (or lack thereof) there are shades of possibility and God fits into the same shade as tooth fairies and Santa. Then it goes on to explain why this is so, and it does a fairly good job of it. I can only assume it gets the facts right, being a casual reader, but it's enough to get someone thinking.<br /><br />It's laid out as a logical argument, sticks pretty close to the point, and concludes that religion is both dangerous and divisive. If you're the kind of person who really believes in the word of any holy book with a great deal of conviction, this is probably not for you. It takes religion off the respect pedestal and applies logic which you're probably going to find offensive or worse. If you're on the fence, however, this could be a fun read. I enjoyed it, although I started out in the atheist category so it didn't exactly offend me in any way. If you get easily offended, well, it's not pulling punches...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This movie is epic, if you have not seen it yet I recommend you to do it now. There is no movie out there that is better then this master piece.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|You'll be shaking your head and laughing at this one. First thing you'll notice is the overblown amateur acting of these college students. I mean, really amateurish and predictable. The shaky camera didn't bother me, as it was meant to look like an original \\"on-location\\" documentary of mindless, insipid, post-high school morons. Reminds one of party-hardy types who need to drink in order to be social and obnoxious at the same time (we've all been around these type idiots).<br /><br />Again, very amateurish filming and directing of airhead yuppie college half-wits. After the first 12 minutes of the film, you really want the \\"Monster\\" (and its little babies) to start wiping out these useless denizens of endless partying. Well, in a fun sort of way. The only tension in the movie is watching these kids partying, and conversing in the usual tripe one engages in with a bunch of drunks. Who by the way, miraculously sober up when the monsters attack (or maybe not).<br /><br />The release of tension from watching these social drunkards is relieved once the loveable monsters begin their mayhem of the city. Of course, the real worth of these \\"ne're do wells\\" in panic and disaster situations is revealed by their absolutely stupified reactions to imminent death. Rob! Rob! ..... Hud! Hud! .....Oh my God! Oh God! ......Hey Dude!<br /><br />Laughingly entertaining. Not scary at all. At 27 minutes into the movie, you'll be chuckling. At 60 minutes, really laughing!  At 70 minutes, you'll be rooting for the monsters!  At 73 mins, 34 secs. your pain will subside. Documentary over. \\"It's a wrap!\\"
B001DJLCPO|4.0|If you like the traveling french circus \\"Cirque du soleil\\" you will find this movie very similar in its surrealism. Fans of the 1986 movie Labyrinth, 2006 El Laberinto del fauno (\\"Pans Labyrinth\\") or 1985 \\"Legend\\" will enjoy this film!
0767836286|1.0|The ending was so anti-climatic; because if you've seen these type of movies, you know what's going on, and what's going to happen.<br /><br />You see how Jeff Bridges is Professor Michael Faraday; being manipulated by the terrorists as he feeds off the death of his wife who was a Federal Agent who died in a shootout (a subtle reference to Randy Weaver family at Ruby Ridge); and his disdain for the Gov't not taking the blame for her death the deaths of others at an IRS building (another subtle reference: The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing). The terrorists put to good use, his paranoia, annoying and insipid behavior to paint a very unbecoming portrait of a man on the verge of the breaking point but, [above] suspicion.....until the end.<br /><br />There was nothing new about a plot of this type genre. Pieced together from so many other plots in the past. The ending was really hokey. I mean, really hokey. Timothy Robbins did an excellent job of the terrorist leader/architect and master manipulator Oliver Lang/William Fenimore.

B00186CE2C|5.0|I first became aware of Dire Straits with the release of their self-titled LP in the late 70s. \\"Sultans of Swing\\" was the song that caught my attention the most. It was fresh and new and retro at the same time. The rest of the album was excellent also. In any case, I gradually burned out on listening to this and their next two albums. Then in 1985, the \\"Brothers in Arms\\" CD appeared and attracted my attention for an entirely different reason. I had put together a stereo featuring the new CD technology and I was quite proud of it. The problem with the CDs was that most of them were analog recordings that had been remastered and put on CDs. A few companies were offering all digital CDs and I sought them out. Telarc Records comes to mind. In any case, the \\"Brothers in Arms\\" CD was an all digital recording, one of the few released by pop groups, and I bought it immediately. It was an excellent recording and I was very satisfied from the viewpoint of the reproduced sound.<br /><br />Aside from the quality of the sound reproduction, this Dire Straits album has proven to be one of my all time favorites with regard to the music. Let's put it this way, I own about 400 LP/CD albums and if I had to get rid of all but the top 50, the Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\" CD would be a keeper. The music is overpowering. The sound is outstanding. The mood of the album is a downer, but it's a downer in a good way (Is that why they call the group Dire Straits?). I'd say it's by far the best album that Dire Straits or Mark Knopfler (one of my all-time favorite guitarists) has ever put out. Excellent! I guess if I had to replace the CD, I'd go for the original 1985 CD version as is sold here.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|This is good background holiday music.  If you are a fan of Enya, you will like this album although the style is a little too predictable, a little too much her earlier works.
B001GQSY5K|3.0|I liked the movie, but I liked the orginal way they did the first cartoons better.
B001EO2UKO|3.0|For Dido fans, this album will not be a disappointment. The album remains in character with her other music, but almost too much so. There is consistent good music, but somewhat ho-hum if you expected anything new and fresh. Its worth the cash, but not likely to create rave reviews.
159737685X|5.0|This early installment in the Harry Bosch series is as good as the rest in the series meaning, at least in my mind, it is a proud member of one of the best set of detective novels currently being produced.<br /><br />Connelly's books are usually deep and gritty and this one is no different. The lead character is Harry Bosch, the leader of a 3 detective team in the LAPD that is assigned an unusually sensitive case. A well-known civil rights attorney that has successfully sued LAPD over and over again for violations of federal civil rights laws has been murdered on the eve of an especially notorious case against the LAPD. Of course, everyone inside LAPD and out believe that a police officer killed him in a fit of revenge and the city is seething.<br /><br />Set just a few years after the Rodney King riots and the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Los Angeles is racially tense, to say the least. This works well with one of the main themes of the entire series - Harry Bosch's name. Harry's real name is Hieronymus Bosch. If you are not familiar with Hieronymus Bosch let me explain. The real Hieronymus Bosch is a Renaissance painter that painted detailed and fanciful paintings of the torments of hell, including demons, strange creatures and their victims. Connelly often presents Harry Bosch as a man walking among the sites and smells of hell - torture, betrayal, riots and the literal burning of parts of the city in protest are the backdrop of this moody, brooding book.<br /><br />Connelly deftly handles the tricky topic of racial discrimination and issues of black and white in this book. While the case is being worked race tints every aspect of the case - Black vs. White vs. Blue (LAPD) is a frequent topic that is discussed - not overtly but neatly inserted as conversations that flow quite naturally in the context of the story.<br /><br />I heard this book as an audiobook and it was truly a joy to hear Dick Hill's narration. He's done several of Connelly's novels and I've never been disappointed with any that he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Sandy has done it again. For the life of me, I couldn't see any negative points to this movie, seeing some in the reviews. I didn't have any trouble following the story line. This movie shows how true love can move mountains. That mailbox was their only connection. I'm a guy that don't cry at weddings. Sandy has the gift of expression, she has a disarming effect on guys. Her charactor (Kate) sent me to a paper towl to dry the tears away in more than one scene.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves did a good job of supporting actor. I was a little disappointed when he didn't put that book in the mail box for Kate.<br /><br />Sandy will break your heart every time, her long brown hair, gental and unguarded brown eyes will make you melt where you stand, I love all her films even the one's that didn't turn out well for her.<br /><br />I've already played this dvd over 10 times. It has given me the hope of finding that special girl, your true love.
3822837849|3.0|Well this book is a steal at the price. It contains all the work published in Stieglitz's Camera Work magazine. This was the outlet for the Pictoralist school of photography who attempted to duplicate the work of painters.    You can quickly understand why the f/64 Group led by Ansel Adams, Weston and Cunningham were revolting against this style. The works are gloomy, brown, soft and derivative of the gloomy soft Victorian style of the painters of the time. There are still many gems included among the chaff and this book should be on your shelf if you are a photographer.    Taschen is publishing more of this type of catalogs of a particular photographer or style and are well worth looking at.
0743454537|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books I've ever read.  This book circulated through my family, and I can't bring myself to sell it.  Jodi Picoult has this fantastic ability to withold critical information from chapter to chapter, keeping you guessing.  At times, however she does seem to give too much seemingly needless in-depth information when developing characters.  Fantastic story, with great twists.  A real tear-jerker.
015603283X|2.0|The Club Dumas is touted as a mystery for intellectuals, but frankly I saw little evidence of deep meanings, insights, or even clever plotting. I was prepared to enjoy a story more accessible than Eco but without the plotholes and inane storylines of Dan Brown. While built on a promising idea, there was none of the art of the former author, and too much of the logical leaps of the latter. Probably the best way to sum it up would be that Perez-Reverte commits the mistake of the least- talented writers; he tells when he should show, usually when trying to move along a storyline that otherwise wouldn't make sense.     - the plot depends on an \\"intertextual\\" confusion between the Dumas original and the Nine Doors book, which is forced upon the reader as there is really no reason in the story that the two literary lines should converge, other than the author wants it to happen   - he paints a totally unsympathetic, 2-dimensional protagonist who is inexplicably charming to all he meets, including the shrewd book collectors and the  beautiful ingenue (young, nubile, & with no reason to be attracted to Corso, even with the weak twist near the end)   - the entire Nine Gates storyline is tortured, but not in the Dante/Milton sense. It is hard to describe this without spoiling the \\"mystery\\", but why would the original printer have chosen such a scheme, destined to be lost except for the oddest of chance, and why would the small differences noted by Corso have any effect at all in an incantation? (the summoner at the end doesn't even use the differences)   - again, difficult to say without revealing the plot, but the rationalization for Rocheforte was unbelievable (attempted vehicular manslaughter, multiple blows to the head, any of which could cause permanent damage, to an end of [spoiler!] \\"just kidding\\")   - the switches in person (from 1st person narrator, to omniscience, back to 1st, and back again) are just clumsy, seeming to underscore the author's inability to let the story tell itself      Ultimately a disappointment, perhaps some would enjoy for beach reading but for me not even worth the distraction from a boring flight.
0446402389|5.0|This is the best book I've read in 2008.  A literal page-turner, it evoked such graphic images in my mind.  I'm easily annoyed by quirks, what I perceive as flaws such as repeat favorite words, and limp writing, and not once did I stumble upon any of these unpardonable wallbangers.  This beautiful book just flowed seemingly effortlessly from beginning to end, captivating me.  I read it by a quiet river in Mexico and was so riveted I forgot where I was.<br /><br />Usually I leave substandard books behind when I travel--not this one.  Had to haul it home and write this lame review that doesn't do justice to what a wonderful job Mr. Smith did.  I'm amazed and impressed at the amount of research that must've gone into this, too--did the author live in Russia, I wonder?
015206396X|4.0|Graceling is not the usual type of book that I read, therefore I started it with some hesitation.  I usually like my fiction to be set in the present day and Graceling is a fantasy type book!<br /><br />I am sooo happy that I did decide to read this book.  While it is aimed at a YA audience, I am far from a YA and I absolutely enjoyed it.  The main premise is of a young girl by the name of Katsa who has \\"grace\\" that is she has special strength and skills which are used by her uncle - the King to protect and defend their universe.  However, the storyline digs much deeper than this as we follow Katsa through what I have come to consider a \\"puberty\\" of sorts - from questionning her \\"grace\\" and the role it plays in her life, to asking herself serious questions about her motives for doing what she does.<br /><br />This novel is full of action and I loved the quick pace.  Each page brings another fresh character or another wonderful adventure.  However, for me, what worked best was the growing up of the main character as she discovers others who share her powers and more importantly, discovers a very special person who will bring her to question her principles and morals on a very deep level.<br /><br />This book was an excellent read.
B001AI1QBI|5.0|On my last Brian Eno review, some-one in the 'Comments' section had the audacity to suggest I was a plank. It's not the worst thing I've been called here in the cheery world of the 'Amazon Review' but it was a rare amusement in amongst all the bile and indignation. Soon, I'm gonna post a notice made up solely from abuse garnered from my 'Comments' sections. That'll be a lot of fun wont it?<br />It's an unfortunate fact of life, some people just don't like the truth however you present it. I think it's good to go against the grain occasionally. I really believe the likes of Gabriel and Sting are talent-less, and one of my favourite bands - The Clash, occasionally did work that was less than brilliant, but it's a personal truth. A review is one person's opinion, right or wrong,(the former in my case obviously) and like, name-calling or personal insults are gonna make me change my mind. I neither have the humility or give a monkeys.<br />Occasionally, our beloved, respected and much worshipped idols are gonna release a cremation, (See Morrissey, Nick Cave, U2 etc..) and unlikely jokers are going to release gems. (See Dollar, Marillion, No Doubt etc..) not to mention a 3rd category where resides terminally untalented people (Paul McCartney, Coldplay, Kate Bush, Mick Hucknall etc..) who's bowel movements would make more entertaining listening...<br />Already I can sense it... \\"What's all this got to do with the Budd/Eno disc!?\\"<br />Well, (constructing a wall of defence as well as self-containment) everything's fine on that front. 'The Plateaux of Mirrors' is ethereal and inspiring, will appeal to people who are genuinely sick of 'rock' and all it's insincerity, and is pretty damn essential. But is that the point?<br />It is one of many little pearls I regularly throw out into cyber-space in the forlorn hope that some-one somewhere will put down their Springsteen cd or the James Blunt download and actually catch one. Will see what's been right in front of them all along.<br />Not a snowball's chance in Hades.<br />The Budd/Eno disc has spine-tingling piano playing,(Harold Budd is a pianist. There's one revelation for a start!) augmented beautifully by Eno's 'other instruments and treatments'.(No -it's serious.) 'The Plateaux of Mirrors' is slightly more obviously melodic than some of Eno's other works, but anybody wanting Stickleback or Jaded Z is probably gonna be disappointed.<br />So, a truthful review, dripping with passion and enthusiasm, much like the challenging and sometimes even dangerous art represented by the (major) talents here, and not the charlatan resolute who've made careers pretending.<br />A gazillion stars for the Budd/Eno disc then, and a slew of humourless negatives for me...<br />\\"Come on now Ess, back to the dark place.....!\\"'s chance in Hades.

B000P12LWY|5.0|Though some have commented on a few historical inaccuracies in this production, the overwhelmingly beautiful nature of this CBC/Irish Television/Showtime series leaves nothing to be desired.  The casting could not be better, and the acting is most excellent.  Costumes, sets, and whatever it takes to make a film like this noteworthy have been well executed.  English history buffs and anyone interested in listening to a well-told tale will be rewarded with viewing The Tudors.  I do not often replay films or televison productions, but this is one that can be played over again and again to experience the magic and charm of a first-rate quality film.    One wishes these producers would continue the tale of the Tudors with Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth's reigns as colourful as their father's, making good material for a few years' more of productions.
0061537934|5.0|This book was highly recommended on the Kindle Boards. Since I love dogs, I was interested and read the reviews here. And, as you can see, this book is loved by most of the people who have read it.    I have the habit of reading the negative reviews before I spend my money on a book. There are some things that drive me nuts in a book, things that might not bother anyone else, but that really grate on me.  So I read the one star reviews and some of the one star people said something that really worried me-- plot developments came out of thin air.  I hate that, it drives me totally insane and I end up tossing the book in the give to the library box.     But it was raining and I have a cold and so I downloaded the book and read it in one sitting.     Those people did not read the same book I did. The plot developments made sense. In fact the one that upset some of the one star reviewers was so boldly telegraphed, I would have been upset if the plot did not go the way it did. (I don't want to add any more spoilers to the mix here.)    As far as Enzo not being realistic, well, really, what kind of criticism is that? Dogs can't write books.  Of course it's not realistic.  As far as what dogs think about things, while I firmly believe that dogs have inner lives, I don't think any of them aspire to be race car drivers. But, heck, I truly believe my shy, scared little poodle dreams of being a big, brave dog someday, so maybe a race car driver's dog dreams of racing.  How do I know? But I'd like to think that maybe they do.    I have no interest in racing at all, but the racing parts were very interesting, which surprised me and the racing theme fully supported the theme of the book--Stay the course, do the right thing, there's no shame in losing the race as long as you try. And someday you will win.  If you like dogs this is a must read. If you don't like dogs, I don't know if you would like this or not.
B000IZJ1J8|4.0|The tempo of Electric Wizard and the other bands being compared is nothing less than a retarded comparison. The sound is grossly different instrumentally. This is a rare pace of music people strive to find. Something that may reignite the sounds of old Sabbath stuff that never got radio play. Although I don't think anything will come close to the amount of good Sabbath songs, or sound as good, it's still nice to hear. It's almost like me saying some Black Sabbath songs are too long and slow, everyone should go listen to Iron Maiden. Bad comparison. It simply means you may not like the sound, but it then shouldnt be compared to something quite different.
B00000IBVC|5.0|There is no more spectacular recording of any opera ever made, to my knowledge.  The Chinese government got behind it to make it a visual masterpiece, and musical personages from throughout the world flew in to see it.

B001K98MFK|5.0|This is a re-release of the Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. If you've seen the originally released DVD, you know that it wasn't available with an English soundtrack- it was Japanese only with English subtitles.  I'll buy the re-released with the hope that the English dub does justice to the dialogue, which tends to wax philosophical.  In the event the English doesn't do the trick, it can still be watched in Japanese with English subtitles.   If you haven't seen this amazing film I strongly suggest you do-- it's visually !STUNNING!  The storyline is complex, yet compelling.
B001GEL1NO|5.0|When I heard that Chris Cornell was going to put out something with Timbaland I was skeptical! I LOVE Chris' work I also happen to be a big fan of Timbaland but together??? I am very happy that the two teamed up Scream has not only pleased me to no end but my family, who are big hip hop fans like it also and are now looking to me for the cliff notes on who Chris Cornell is.  Timbaland offers Chris' sound the commercialism shot that he needs right now (it seemed to work for Justin Timberlake) and frankly Chris Cornell could sing a Burger King Menu and sound great and probably make it a hit! These two are two great sounds that are great together like chocolate and peanut butter.  Scream is a great collaboration and I'm so happy that Chris Cornell has done it again!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Everyone must own this and watch it more than once. It's a Chevy Chase classic.
B001ECQ75A|3.0|I actually give this movie 3.5 stars.  It's enjoyable, the characters are good, the animation is very good.  But . . . Overall Black's \\"Nacho Libre\\" is much funnier and is somewhat similar in basic plot, although it is a live action film.  Kids into Kung Fu should like it very much, adults will find it a little less interesting because so much of the plot has been portrayed more effectively in films previously.  This is a good rental and a buy for younger children.  It left me feeling there should have been more to it.
0316017922|5.0|I've listened to all of Gladwell's three books via Audible and have enjoyed each for the ways they made me look at things differently.  However, I found Outliers to be the most compelling from an entertainment standpoint.  The content isn't anything amazingly revolutionary, but it's quite interesting to see how situations are often produced by circumstances that aren't obvious at first.
B001FB55LM|3.0|Is it really healthy to say yes to everything? That seems to be the point \\"Yes Man\\" is trying to make. It tells the story of Carl Allen (Jim Carrey), a closed-off banker from Los Angeles who's challenged to accept whatever opportunities come his way, no matter what. The idea of expanding your horizons is a good one, although when you find yourself saying yes to things like Internet ads for penis enlargements or Persian mail-order brides, chances are you're taking the challenge a little too seriously. It's not about saying yes to everything--it's about saying yes when you know it feels right. What I find amazing is that this movie is based on a biography by British writer and humorist Danny Wallace, who spent six months accepting every offer in an attempt to make his life more interesting. Did he realize what kind of movie the Americans wanted to make? I guess it doesn't matter, not when you've practiced saying yes to everything.    Is this to say that Jim Carrey should have said no to \\"Yes Man\\"? Let me answer that with a resounding maybe. It's by no means a great film, but it's not a terrible film, either; it's an occasionally amusing comedy that gives Carrey license to indulge in the goofy mannerisms he's become so famous for. In the course of the story, he gets drunk out of his mind, engages in a barroom brawl, and drinks enough Red Bull to keep him wired for an entire night. He even wraps tape around his head, distorting his face grotesquely. While not very inspired, you do have to admire an actor that can bring so much youthful energy into a role. I admire him, at least.    The plot: The always negative, recently divorced Carl runs into Nick (John Michael Higgins), an old friend who claims that a self-help guru inspired him to live his life to the fullest. He takes Carl to a Yes seminar hosted by the guru, named Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). Once the seminar begins, Bundley pressures Carl into accepting the Just Say Yes challenge. Now things start to get interesting. First, he gives a homeless man a lift, and when he asks for all of Carl's money, Carl willingly hands it over. Later on, he finally visits his elderly neighbor, Tillie (Fionnula Flanagan), who can do some pretty wild things with her mouth once she removes her dentures. He takes guitar lessons. He learns to speak Korean. At work, Carl begins accepting every loan request. He also says yes to his boss, Norman (Rhys Darby), who really seems to like themed costume parties.    One of the more pleasant outcomes of this new life philosophy is Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who Carl met at a gas station. Allison dabbles in a number of things. She paints. She rides a scooter. She does charity work. She's part of an unknown rock group called Munchausen By Proxy (some may call them edgy, but the reality is that they're untalented). She heads a small group that somehow combines a love of photography with a love of jogging; every morning at 6:00, she and her group run around Griffith Park with cameras in their hands. I know, it doesn't make much sense, but she seems to be getting something out of it. She's also falling in love with Carl. What she doesn't yet realize is the reason why he's saying yes to everything.    The only person who has any grasp of the situation is Carl's newly engaged best friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper). While he never appreciated Carl's refusal to do anything social, he doesn't agree with the yes-only philosophy he's now living by. He makes his point twice, first by announcing in a bar that Carl would be picking up the tab, second by asking him to plan his fiancée's wedding shower. It isn't long before other friends start taking advantage of Carl; at that point, he finally begins to realize how blindly he's been going about this whole yes thing. It comes to a head on a spur-of-the-moment trip to Lincoln, Nebraska, when he's arrested on suspicion of being a terrorist.    So again, I ask: Is this something Jim Carrey should have said no to? I admit, the concept is kind of funny, and there were a few select moments that made me chuckle. But I never got as far as laughing out loud, probably because the film is geared more towards a younger, more easily amused crowd. The one I was with certainly had a ball, especially later in the film, when Carl ended up on a motorcycle dressed in nothing but a hospital gown. The bike's powerful torque was apparently not as funny as the revealing nature of the gown. And after reaching his destination, making tire marks on the pavement, and walking slow motion out of the smoke, the audience actually applauded. Yes, there's nothing more exciting than a scantily clad comedian walking away from a motorcycle.    Did Danny Wallace do any of this? How should I know? I haven't read his book. But given his stature as an author, do you think he could see \\"Yes Man\\" and think it's funny? I once again find myself turning to maybe as an answer. Incidentally, that word plays a very important role near the end of the film, which is very fitting in my opinion; it tells me that even the filmmakers were unsure about what they were dealing with. Let me put it this way: If you consistently get your money's worth out of Jim Carrey comedies, then chances are you'll have fun watching this movie. If not, then it's entirely your call. The ads say that yes is the new no, but I think that might be pushing it.
006082543X|1.0|CORALINE is a wonderful book...one of the best children's/Young Adult books ever penned (although I know more adults who've had the heebie jeebies scared out of them by this fine novel).  For reasons unknown, Neil Gaiman seems to allow artist P. Craig Russell to adapt Gaiman's prose work, turning them into \\"graphic novels.\\"  It's not a match made in heaven.  Russell's illustrations add NOTHING to Gaiman's fine prose.  If anything, Russell's illustrations tend to steal the thunder of unleashed & wild imagination that comes from reading a Gaiman story or novel.     P. Craig Russell's artwork is pedestrian (at best)and, truth be told, \\"mundane\\" would be a more accurate word to describe it.  His illustrations are so mediocre that they actually detract from Gaimans' fine storytelling abilities.   I do not know why they continue this collaboration...perhaps they're trying to hit the audience with Attention Deficiency Disorder, those who might not otherwise read a book unless EVERY last detail is reproduced in colorful illustration.  Much of CORALINE'S magic works in the same way that old radio programs worked (in the pre-television days) or the way songs worked so well (in the pre-MTV days)..Gaiman's prose allows the reader to open up the mind's cathedrals to conjure up our own nightmarish & magical worlds.  Russell's intrusion on this sacred bond between writer &  reader breaks an otherwise near-sacred relationship.  A movie version of this book?  Yes.  I can see how this will allow the story to flourish in a new way and direction (although I imagine some of the more gripping psychological aspects of CORALINE might be lost when released in cinema houses...of course, this remains to be seen).  As with P. Craig Russell's other adaptations of Neil Gaiman's prose works, his illustrations only cheapen what are otherwise masterfully told stories.  Please DO NOT think that I am knocking P. Craig Russell's known abilities/skill as an artist: his collaboration with Neil Gaiman onan ORIGINAL/JOINT effort, such as their joint work on SANDMAN'S \\"Ramadan\\" remains one of the finest comic books in existence.   However, Russell's adaptations of Gaiman's prose work are worlds removed from their beautiful, landmark issue of SANDMAN...and, instead, makes the CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED comics of old seem like masterpieces by comparison.  I'd love nothing more than to see Gaiman/Russell collaborate on a comic-book such as \\"Ramadan\\" (or the later SANDMAN-related story \\"Death in Venice\\").  However, Russell & Gaiman should do their reputations...as well as their readers...a favor and stop creating graphic novels out of Gaiman's fine prose.  It insults Gaiman's legacy, as well insulting  the intelligence of Gaiman's readers.

The people that helped put this together are also very reliable teachers of our day.  Also the complementary online version is absolutely awesome.  Sometimes when you want to go somewhere else to read the Bible or prepare for Bible study, you don't have to take this huge book with you if you don't want to.  I personally enjoy having a physical copy to read from and online version to do research on so this is perfect.

1439102813|5.0|Story told from the point of view of Alice, a woman just celebrating her fiftieth birthday, a Harvard professor and researcher in the field of linguistics. Alice begins having memory lapses and word-finding difficulties that she first writes off to menopausal symptoms, but when she at one point finds herself on a jog a few blocks from home feeling totally lost, she schedules a checkup with her family doctor. With a referral to a neurologist in hand, after a barrage of tests, Alice finds herself with a tentative diagnosis of EOAD--Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease, which applies to those under the age of sixty-five.<br /><br />Allowing this to sink in for a full ten days before sharing the news with her husband John, Alice does some research and is at first despondent. But share the news she does, and her husband, a research biologist, seems almost more devastated than Alice. Genetic testing confirms this diagnosis, and Alice must now share the news with her three children, knowing full well that they may have inherited this tendency as well. Alice's mother was killed in a car crash at the age of forty-one and her father was an alcoholic who died at seventy, and she had attributed his confusion to alcoholic encephalopathy, so she isn't really sure which parent she inherited the defective gene from.<br /><br />A real tear-jerker of a book, very thought provoking and heart-breaking in many ways. So much attention is focused on the caregivers of those with Alzheimer's, and so little on the patients themselves, especially in the early stages of the disease when they know they're confused and understand all too well what's in store for them. Alice sets out to remedy that problem and forms a support group for other younger people like herself and tries to cope as best she can. Recommended highly for anyone who knows someone with this devastating disease--which is horrible at any age, but particularly for those it strikes in the prime of their lives.

I bring them with me to use in recording studios because they are comfortable after a long time of having them on and the sound quality is good.

I first got wind of these watching a Sting recording video several years ago and he had these on in the studio.
B001AKTZPA|5.0|It's hard for me to rate this album among CCR's catalog of fine releases. I guess I'd have to say that my favorite CCR album is the one I am listening to at the time. I was 13 when this album came out and was just beginning to earn some of my own money cutting grass in the summer and shoveling snow in the winter. This was the first album I ever bought with my own money so it has a special place in my mind. This is the first that I bought of the newly remastered set of CCR releases. I have since bought the rest of them and I am very pleased with the sound and the packaging. If you are a CCR fan, then you will want to get all of the new releases. They are excellent!!!! Of course, who can forget the ever popular misunderstood lyric? Yes, there is a bathroom on the right!
1416595546|5.0|Sashenka is a riveting story about a family in Russia during and after the revolution. Sashenka is a true believer. She is a Bolshevik, one of the originals. She is only 16 years old, and with the zeal of a teenager, she embraces a philosophy that will change the world. I have often wondered why thoughtful, educated, well-to-do people would subscribe to communism, and this story sheds light on that question. Sashenka's early influences include a father who is an arms dealer, a rich capitalist who profits from the misery of others. He loves her but has little time to display affection to her. Her mother is a socialite with the morals of cat. Her drunken excesses disgust Sashenka. Sashenka sees the problems in her society and believes the world should be organized other than the way it is. So when the revolution comes, Sashenka is ready. She is a major player in the end of the tsarist Russia and the rise of the communist party.    Sashenka, and others like her, truly believe they are right in what they do. They believe the suffering and death of the merchant class is proper and right, because it will lead to a more enlightened world. This belief is so strong, Sashenka barely flinches when she sees a good friend of hers killed by a mob and \\"reduced to a smear on the sidewalk\\". She never acknowledges any wrong in the death of enemies of state. As a true believer, she sees such things as necessary, not evil, and she never expresses any remorse or regret.    Eventually, as with so many people in Stalin's extended inner circle, it becomes Sashenka's turn to face the reality of what her grand revolution has become. She is arrested, sent to prison, beaten, tortured, tried, convicted, and executed. Sashenka, like so many of her peers, never acknowledges there is anything wrong with a state terrorizing its citizens, only that it made a mistake with her personally, since she is genuinely innocent. And like the others, she goes to her death declaring her loyalty to the state, and to comrade Stalin.    The revolutionaries of Sashenka's generation continued to be true believers until the bitter end. Even 80 years later, when it was clear their grand plan had utterly failed, they continued to keep their secrets and defend their ethical choices. So the question is, by embracing these moral values, does that make them good people or bad people? If someone honestly believes she is making the world a better place, even at the cost of torture and death of herself and others, is that a righteous position?    I don't really know the answer. I could never understand how such things could happen in the first place. But this book made it seem real to me. It helped me to see communist fanatics as people who thought they were the good guys. Sashenka's story is fictional, but it is based on events that actually happened to hundreds of thousands of people. It is very well done.

6304712944|3.0|Josh Logan's film of \\"Camelot\\" does many things well. It evokes both the fantasy elements and the stark medieval atmosphere of the original show, while adding many outdoor scenes that were not possible on the stage. Sets and costumes are stunning, and Logan succeeds brilliantly in recreating a fantasy world that is both romantic and realistic.<br /><br />The 2 leads are excellent, especially Richard Harris as the noble, flawed Arthur, full of blind optimism and undue reliance on his childhood memories of Merlin. Vanessa Redgrave is both regal and sensual in her portrayal of Guenevere, although her singing voice is rather thin. Franco Nero fares less well; although he certainly looks the part of Lancelot,  his wooden acting and dubbed singing voice severely limit his credibility.<br /><br />The film does not resolve the inherent problems that the original Broadway show had: a listless Act 2, and a ponderous, increasingly morbid tone throughout. The arrival of Mordred in the second half changes the tone of the film completely, and we find Arthur helpless to defend his beloved Camelot, as he becomes increasingly detached from reality and consumed by his reliance on Merlin's sorcery to help him cope with the destruction of his idealized kingdom. In this regard, Richard Harris is brilliant: his Arthur is both a man and a boy, full of hope and valor, yet unable to comprehend how his \\"Jenny\\" could betray him and Camelot itself. Although the ending renews Arthur's hope to some extent, the kingdom of Camelot ends up being merely a memory, a wistful sigh in an otherwise harsh, medieval world of war and chaos. This story of 3 people who genuinely love each other, yet are destroyed by their passions, is the very heart of \\"Camelot\\", and the film succeeds in portraying this tragic element of the story.<br /><br />Where the film suffers most is in the music. Several songs from the stage version were deleted from the film (although the only really regrettable deletion is the lovely \\"Before I Gaze at You Again\\"), and as previously mentioned, Vanessa Redgrave's singing is rather weak. One wonders why she was not dubbed as Nero was, although she does deserve kudos for taking on such challenging vocal material, especially in the wake of Julie Andrews' stunning work on the original cast album.<br /><br />Overall then, \\"Camelot\\" is both a success and a failure; it is effective in portraying a medieval world of fantasy and heartbreak, yet as a musical film it lacks the magic of earlier Lerner and Loewe works, and at 3 hours it leaves the audience wanting both less, and yet more.You Again\\"), and as previously mentioned, Vanessa Redgrave's singing is rather weak.

B001J53X9U|4.0|What else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? With writing more complex than any comic book movie before it, perfect casting and equally perfect acting, masterful directing, and breathtaking cinematography and special effects make this movie a watershed achievement, not only in its genre but in the history of filmmaking.<br /><br />Returning from Batman Begins is writer/director Christopher Nolan and co-writer David Goyer, whom continue their dark, gritty, and startlingly real approach to the Batman mythos, but Christopher's brother Jonathan joins the team after cowriting The Prestige with Chris to craft a superhero story that goes beyond the typical \\"good vs. evil\\" story. The Dark Knight dares to relate its protagonists and antagonists to moral and society issues regarding war, terrorism, hope, despair, good men making compromises \\"for the greater good\\" that our own world currently faces, and dares to suggest that there are no easy answers or tidy resolutions to our problems.<br /><br />Of course, the film's standout performance belongs to the late Heath Ledger, whose Joker is no over-the-top cartoon like Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the character in the Tim Burton film. Ledger is captivating in his nuanced turn as Batman's greatest foe; a frightening anarchist whom wears smeared, cracking, caked-on clown make-up and licks his Glasgow smile scars with a flicking tongue reminsicent of the evil serpeant that tempted Eve with the apple. Like the shark in Jaws, this Joker strikes quickly and without warning and brings a simmering, looming threat to the film that remains even when he is not on screen. Some more cynical minds believe that the Oscar buzz the performance has received (and the films' $530 million box ofice take) is due to Ledger's very sudden and very public demise, but those people downplay Ledger's horrfyingly brilliant performance.<br /><br />Ledger may be getting the most praise, but the rest of the A-list cast deserves much credit too. Christian Bale once again proves why he is the best Batman of them all, a man who is conflicted between his quest for justice and his desire to live a normal life, and finds his own moral codes and dedication to the mission tested by a nemesis whom follows no rules and knows no fear. Though a lot has been made of Bale's use of a very raspy voice when in his cape and cowl, but I personally didn't have a problem with it. It seems like a logical choice by a man trying to conceal his identity to change his voice. But others found it distracting.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart would give the film's other breakthrough performance as Harvey Dent, Gotham's championing District Attorney, determined to clean up Gotham's streets. But Dent's story is a tragic one, transforming him into the murderous Two-Face, a scarred madman whom decides the fate of his enemies with the flip of a coin.<br /><br />Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, the only good cop left in a city overflowing with corruption, whom must make compromises and even deceive his own family to get the job done. Michael Caine reprises his role as Bruce Wayne's butler and erstwhile mentor Alfred, Morgan Freeman returns as Wayne Enterprises' CEO and Batman's tech supplier Lucius Fox, and Maggie Gyllenhall takes over for Katie Holmes as Bruce's love interest Rachel Dawes. Though Gyllenhall isn't as attractive as Holmes, she doesn't seem as out of place among such high-caliber actors as Holmes did.<br /><br />The only reason this Blu-Ray gets four stars instead of five is because of its paltry special features. Sure, there are the cool \\"Psychology of Batman\\" and \\"Batman Tech\\" features and the \\"Gotham Tonight\\" faux news clips featuring Anthony Michael Hall's Mike Engel character that made their rounds on the internet during the film's brilliant viral marketing campaign. But the DVD and Blu-Ray \\"boast\\" only three hours of behind-the-scenes footage, and in an age where movies like Lord of the Rings feature hours and hoursand HOURS of behind-the-scenes footage and special features, it's a major disappointment that The Dark Knight only has around three hours of special footage. And even worse, no on-set interviews or pieces featuring Heath Ledger himself. I know Warner Bros. was afraid that people would accuse them of trying to capitalize on Ledger's tragic death, but to not even include some interviews of him or a documentary in memoriam is a disservice. The two-disk offering of The Crow featured Brandon Lee's final interview, so I don't see why Warner Bros. wouldn't include an interview of Ledger. I hope they're not saving it for future editions of the DVD/Blu-Ray, because that would truly be opportunism on their part.<br /><br />So in all great movie, but the Blu-Ray leaves a little to be desired.
B001GV09FS|2.0|I bought this \\"deluxe edition\\" CD of Mamma Mia! thinking that it was actually going to include the songs Chiquitita and I Do, I Do, I Do and maybe even Waterloo (which should have been on the original movie soundtrack in my opinion).  I was, however quite wrong.  All this edition includes is the original soundtrack plus a 12 minute or so DVD with recording sessions - basically the same thing you see on one of the movie's DVD special features.  It's a complete waste of money.  If you don't already own the CD, then definitely buy this one, but if you own the original soundtrack, DON'T bother wasting your money on it.  Talk about bad marketing.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|Last weekend we had family movie night featuring the new DVD Horton Hears a Who. My skeptical husband (who is not necessarily a fan of \\"family movie night\\") said, \\"How can they make a 90 minute movie out of a 30 page book?\\"<br /><br />The kids and I saw this movie in the theater, and I remembered thinking what a great job they did adapting Dr. Seuss' picture book to a feature-length film, so I quickly replied, \\"Quite well, actually.\\"<br /><br />Jim Carrey (Horton) and Steve Carell (the mayor of Whoville) keep parents and children laughing. Seriously, the kids were guffawing, and one time Amanda (age 10) looked over at my husband and said, \\"Look -- Daddy's smiling. He likes it too!\\"<br /><br />This movie adaptation perfectly captures the whimsical Seussian world without it seeming too grim, as it sometimes does. The colors are bright and the people are delightful. The story is told with narration straight from the book (and additional narration that sounds as if it's straight from the book), interspersed seamlessly with scenes of dialogue and action.<br /><br />The kids laughed (and yes, we laughed too), but the bigger themes really come through loud and clear, without being at all preachy: responsibility, the value of each person -- and as a parent -- letting your kids be who they are, not who we want them to be.<br /><br />And of course there's Horton, the responsible elephant, reminding us often, \\"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant: an elephant's faithful 100%.\\" Oh, how can you not just love Horton?<br /><br />This is the best family film I've seen in a while.

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Unfortunately, I went into this movie expecting to see an epic superhero movie.  What the movie actually is a fairly dry and boring mix of James Bond (indeed with Morgan Freeman as Q), a mafia movie, and a police procedural.  Heath Ledger does a decent job with what script he had to work with, but to be honest this is closer to an episode of NYPD blue than a grand good vs. evil superhero adventure.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|Hitchcock and a shower. That's all you need to know to identify this film classic and this special edition is phenomenal with great extras and commentary, The delivery was swift, and it is now a more than welocme ediition to my Hitchcock collection. The Master of Suspense does more with less... less gore and less camera trickery along with great storytelling and a wit that is dark yet strangely humorous at times. I could not be happier... even though I may take a bath after watching!

B000002IAZ|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out, and just about wore it out playing it all the time.  Say what you want about the ego's of the band members, but they really did write and play music for a generation.  \\"I am a child\\", \\"Nowadays Clancy\\", \\"Expecting to fly\\", and \\"Sit down I think I love you\\", are in my book pieces of an era that sadly is gone by.  It was music that you could sing along to, or sit and listen to quietly.  The distinct sound of Buffalo Springfield was magic.  I still play this CD and I can remember the memories of a time that life was easier, and people were kinder, without having to squeeze into my old patched bluejeans.

The other songs are nice, but I find myself skipping over them.  She was a hit, then she was gone.......so I ask you.....where the heck did Ricky Lee Jones go??????
031606792X|1.0|There was something very familiar about the first few chapters of \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" I couldn't put my finger on it, but I felt like I had read all of this before. Then it hit me: this is the same kind of drivel I used to write in my diary when I was 13. It's an idealized view of adulthood from a child's point of view.<br /><br />In this final book of the Twilight saga, Bella and Edward get married, go off on a fantastic honeymoon and Bella gets pregnant with Edward's half-vampire baby. After a short but difficult pregnancy and gruesome childbirth, Bella's teetering on the edge of death, so Edward turns her into a vampire. Suddenly, Bella's the best vamp ever. She almost never craves human blood, is stronger than any other character, and has the single-handed power to shield anyone she loves from danger. Her best-friend and would-be love interest Jacob Black imprints (falls in love, werewolf-style) with Bella and Edward's daughter, so there's an automatic truce between the werewolves and the vampires. Bella has to give up nothing and gains everything. And it's all wrapped up in a nice little package.<br /><br />I'm giving this review one star for two reasons. First, because Meyer finally answers one burning question I've had about Twilight from the beginning. It's clearly stated here that vampires are stuck at the level of development they were in when they died. This explains why Edward acts like a hot-headed 17-year-old when he's 110 and should know better.<br /><br />Second, I've long said that Bella's point of view is the least interesting in the entire series. Finally, Meyer seems to agree with me and we get several chapters narrated by Jacob. While Rosalie would have been the more obvious and better choice to narrate these chapters, which deal with Bella's pregnancy and the birth of her daughter, Renesmee (don't get me started on that name), Jacob has his own distinct voice and it's nice to get out of Bella's head and see some action for a change.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's the only action we see. Aside from a few weak disappointing chapters about the invasion of the Volturi, this book is a straight-up preteen fantasy that's practically an advertisement for teenage marriage and parenthood. I'm a teacher and every time I see a young kid reading this book, I get a queasy feeling. Bella and Edward's marriage is unrealistic. Their lives as parents are unrealistic. They live in a fairy tale that wouldn't be out of place in a Disney animated feature.  The new Mr. and Mrs. Cullen live in a cottage that their parents built for them. They never have to pay rent or mortgage. They have a housekeeper. Bella obviously never has to make dinner. Their daughter conveniently disappears whenever they want to make love. They never get tired. They never get old. Edward's parents will never age. They'll never die.<br /><br />This isn't even accounting for the fact that their daughter is the perfect child. Renesmee ages at six times the rate of a normal child and her mental development races past her physical development at an even quicker speed. She doesn't linger through the terrible twos. She doesn't need to be potty-trained. Nobody has to teach her table manners or the ABCs or how to talk. Best of all, in a short six years, she'll be Bella's age forever, a permanent best buddy with whom to share clothes and secrets. What 13-year-old doesn't want a child like that?<br /><br />I realize that I'm splitting hairs. After all, this is a novel about vampires. But Meyer builds so many plot holes into her book that it's impossible not to nitpick. Consider this:<br /><br />1. Renesmee isn't possible by the rules Meyer herself has set up in the series. Again and again, she mentions that all of a vampires bodily fluids are venom - even their tears. Taking that into account, Edward couldn't possibly impregnate Bella. They couldn't even have sex without her becoming a vampire. Besides, Carlisle says that vampires and humans have different numbers of chromosomes. That alone would make impregnation impossible. I'm willing to believe in Meyer's vampire myth for the duration of the series but, when she starts to contradict herself, I start to lose interest.<br /><br />2. There is absolutely no reason for the Volturi to exist at all. Why do vampires need to keep their existence secret? They're stronger than humans. They can reproduce instantly and indefinitely. They can only be killed by being ripped to shreds and burned. If that's the case, even an atomic bomb wouldn't kill them. The Volturi; who aren't scary at all, by the way; should stop hiding from humanity and just take over. Then, they'd be a real threat to the Cullen's peaceful existence.<br /><br />3. Imprinting is pedophilia. Period. There's no way around it. When an 18-year-old man decides that a newborn infant will be his bride someday, it also means that he's making plans to have sex with her. Every time he looks at her, he knows that they'll have sex. I realize that the imprinting storyline plays into a teen fantasy of having an uncle figure finally realize that you're that special girl. But guess what? In a lot of cases, that would also be pedophilia. I'm a mom and a teacher and each time Jacob looked at Renesmee, I wanted to gag.<br /><br />4. The vampires who show up to witness for the Cullens during their showdown with the Volturi kill hundreds of innocent people in the Seattle area. The Cullens, who have been respectful of and merciful to humans for thousands of pages, are suddenly okay with this. This is largely inconsistent with their characters so far. Renesmee is saved but at what cost?<br /><br />I could continue this list forever. After all, the book seemed to go on forever. Conversations led nowhere. New characters were introduced with no purpose. Pages and pages could have been sliced out of this book and nobody would have been the wiser. And that's not even what killed this series for me. This series died the minute Edward Cullen stopped being dangerous. The first book read like a campy parody of a teen romance and a vampire romance. You never knew when Bella would be in danger from the love of her life. Edward could have snapped at any minute and Bella would have been a goner. By the first page of \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" this had all changed. Edward was treating Bella like a porcelain doll. He even shied away from having sex with her after he bruised her. (Not to be graphic - the book certainly isn't - but some human couples wake up sore and bruised after consensual, albeit rough, sex. And nobody cares). When that happened, the book became boring, banal and tiresome.<br /><br />This series could have gone so many ways. Meyer could have done so much with the material. But, she didn't. Instead, we're at the tacked-on, sugary fairy tale ending of what should have been dark and campy and wonderful. I read this series because my students recommended it. Monday, I'm going to recommend they watch [[ASIN:B00005221I Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete First Season]]. I'm going to watch it too.

On a warm spring or summer day, with the top down on the car.........this music makes the whole day seem complete.

It can start long conversations with your kids.  I am a college professor and many of my colleagues use it in their classes to start discussions on perspective and diversity.  But my young kids love it just for it's colorful pictures.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|While I admittedly don't watch much television (drivel), there are gems that make up for the rest of it.  This is surely one of them.<br /><br />I was warned by fans there was only one season before I immersed into this DVD set.  That still made it no easier to take at the end of 14 episodes . . .<br /><br />I'm sure the cancellation of Firefly will go down in TV history as one of the worst studio decisions ever; it's utterly amazing how many folks are still waiting for more, even after a great movie sequel.<br /><br />As the DVD says, it'd be a great idea if someone now, post movie, would make a great TV show from this.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|There are plenty of very good, very thorough reviews already, so I'm just going to add a couple of specific notes.    It's a small thing, but I wish more dvds provided complete closed captioning.  While the director's commentary of the wide-screen Wall-E is closed captioned (and I applaud them for doing that), things like the deleted scenes still aren't.    Also, it would have been nice to have some variety in the captains' gender or ethnicity. Sadly, all the captain photos are of white guys.  It may seem to be an inconsequential thing, but the aggregate of inconsequential things makes it clear that there is still a lot of subtle discrimination occurring in our world.  I look forward to the day where the only place you can find a collection of only white guys is in history books.
015206396X|4.0|Hi  Firstly, those reviewing this book need to remind themselves that this is the author's first novel so excuse her is she doesn't explore the issues of culture, politics or religion (to me this had little impact on my enjoyment of the story anyway).   The main character is well developed, identifiable & consistent in her development. The romance aspect was appropriate and thankfully not formulaic or generic.   I read a great deal of novels & must say I have been depressed over the number of books recently that have been good but hardly 'page turners'. Graceling has restored my faith. I was late to work not once, but twice because I had to finish the part I was on & the next two chapters.  The one negative thing I must say to the author is that you deprived readers of a true & fitting climax between your heroine & such an evil antagonist. It was as if the you couldn't come up with a fitting plot development so you finished with such unsatisfying abruptness.    cheers  Bud
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Wall-E.  It looked cute in the previews, so we bought it sight unseen.  One of these days, I'll learn NOT to do that.  Starship Troopers 2 should've been the capper, but sometimes I have to learn the hard way.<br /><br />Wall-E is enigmatic. He is diligent. He is curious. He is easy to love.  My problem with this film is that the story elements are very deep and heavy for smaller children, but moreover, they were wholly awful to watch if you have even half a heart.  I have to say that I failed to derive much enjoyment at all from this film, and what I did, was killed by the horror of the \\"message.\\"<br /><br />People [Americans] too fat to WALK, living aboard a robot-run ship while a single Wall-E unit attempts to clean up the messy planet mankind has left behind.<br /><br />No mention is made of other countries or their populous, but the accents of those aboard the Axiom [a proposition considered to be self-evident] were purely American.<br /><br />And in the end, [SPOILERS] when people return to Earth, it's to the same filth-ridden earth they left 700 years prior, with the same problems, and with a total lack of knowledge of how to survive.  OH, and they're too FAT to WALK.  Lest we forget.

B001AII4TA|4.0|If you - like me - enjoy a good cartoon, this is one to watch. It's not only funny and enjoyable, it's flat our hilarious. The comedy is very well timed and not to dirty.<br /><br />I can't wait to get the sequel.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I originally heard the song \\"Take a Bow\\" from the Watchmen (movie) trailer and immediately loved it.  Upon buying the CD I was amazed how almost every song had a different sound to it.  From the agressive electronic sounds of \\"Take a Bow\\" to the melodic tones of \\"Starlight\\" to the upbeat rocking sounds of \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", each song draws you in.  It's a CD you don't get bored of because there is no repetitive sounds beween the songs and it almost plays like a compilation of various yet similar artists.  Overall, I would recommend this CD for it's new and different yet refreshing sounds.

0393062430|4.0|It teaches you to optimize your outcome from a mathematical logic. Progressive knowledge is well written with simple life examples and experiences, which is later supported by scientific reason. It requires basic math and interest.<br />You don't have to be in a Businsss Major to appreciate this book; this book is designed to be read and understood easily.<br /><br />This is a book to exercise your mind into logic thinking.
1600243916|4.0|Excellent premise.  Though, some examples were not completely accurate; Bill Joy was credited with way too much.  Also, Larry Ellison was not even mentioned.  Though, I can see why; he does not exactly fit the model.  He did not have all of the backing that some of the other examples had.    Overall the book's ideas are good.  Anyone can do a great deal of good if just allowed the opportunity.
B001BN1ZHW|3.0|Johnny Depp was perfect to play the part of Sweeney Todd, and Timothy Spall, who played the part of Beadle, was also perfect for his part in this very different type of musical. There was way too much spurting blood, which was not very realistic, and in my opinion, took away much enjoyment of the movie.  The actors actually sang instead of lipsinking, which was a nice touch.  Depp's voice surprisingly was quite good.  The dynamic sound of the organ during the beginning titles and introduction was chilling.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer was very clear and detailed,and since the movie was purposely dark, the bits of color throughout stood out vividly. The audio was also good from the front and center channels, but was lacking a bit from the rear. There are a lot of good special features, but be warned, there is a lot of blood,so it's not for everyone.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This year was the first time I made a point of watching 'American Idol' and each week, David's performances amazed me.  I was eager to hear how he sounded on this CD and  was not disappointed.  It contains a variety of songs that showcase his talent.  One of the highlights is listening to his final 'Idol' performance after winning the title that is the last song on the CD and comparing it to his other songs on the CD.  Go David!

0307383415|5.0|President Obama's \\"Dreams from My Father\\" is written beautifully. He writes candidly and with great compassion for, and insight into the characters of the people weather friends or family around him.  Like great fiction, his description of those far away places brings them close to You.  And his real life people become so known as if they were your own kin, this including the writer himself who opens his heart and mind to the reader.
B0000009UG|5.0|One of the most original CD's of it's time.  David Bowie at his best.
B001F290E4|5.0|I don't really care if this is a stellar production, if the pros got together to intentionally (and malevolently) create a best-seller, if every aspect of this CD was manipulated to be a success. Neither do I understand why people seem to be disappointed with this album: if you were expecting this CD to be one more Seal the cool-rhythm-dance-catchy-tune guy, do your research and read the reviews -- otherwise you WILL be upset.<br /><br />\\"Soul\\" is a departure, and a most interesting one, from Seal's usual music. It was conceived to be a departure. All you have to do to realize this is look at the song names. Now, if you're good with a more intimate, slower-paced, easy-listening Seal -- more related to the lighter songs in \\"System\\" --, you'll be fine with this album. If you're expecting something along the lines of \\"Human Being\\" (which I didn't like), you won't enjoy \\"Soul\\" at all.<br /><br />Having said that, I for one think \\"Soul\\" is a fine album. Seal delivers crooner-like, intimate renditions of well-known songs with his trademark husky, velvety voice. A real class act and proof that he is good and versatile enough to sing whatever he pleases -- and very well, thank you. I especially like \\"People Get Ready\\", which has been covered by almost everyone in this planet. Seal's version of it is as good as the best of them.

B001GKJ2F2|1.0|Angelina Jolie,     This is a request from a huge fan of movies. I am writng today to ask you to please stop making movies. Every time you make one, the credit of the art of acting dies a little bit. You have yet to produce anything talent wise, and we are writing to ask you to stop once and for all. You are helping lots of people around the world with your humanatarian efforts, but hurting just as many (actually many more) with your acting ability. (sorry to anyone with acting skills, using her name and the word ability just seems wrong). So please go help the thousands you do help with your outside movies work, and help the millions who love movies and stop once and for all. PS, I have now seen a bunch of your movies, and would request you send me a refund. I am only asking for the money for ticket prices or the cost of renting, so it should not be a big deal, its not like I am asking for the price of time and brain cells lost by having to watch your movies.

B0000029DD|5.0|I'd never heard of Jeff Buckley until yesterday but after listening to Hallelujah on You Tube I went  out found his CD. There won't be any more music from Buckley because of his tragic early death but thank goodness he recorded this.     Every song on the CD is great but the one that stands out above them all is his version of Hallelujah. The song was recently remade by the winner of Britains X Factor (their version of American Idol) and her version is pretty but this is a man's song. And of all the men who've sung it, this is forever Buckley's song. Some people are calling it a hymn and maybe in their patchouli sented alternate universe it is, but this song is about a man who is in total, desperate love. It's a love gone wrong but he's hanging on to this woman life a drowning man because she's gotten into his blood and there is no life without her.     This tortured man in love song belongs up there with Otis Redding singing \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long,\\" Johnny Cash singing \\"Hungry,\\", George Jones singing \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\\" Pavarotti singing \\"Nessun Dorma\\", Johnny Lee Hooker singing \\"I Cover the Waterfront\\" and anything Sinatra sang while Ava Gardner was making him crazy. From the first exhausted sigh to the final screamed Hallelujah, this song will send chills down your spine.     All in all, it's an astonishing body of work.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|The DVD is not the original DVD produced and sold by Disney.  I have the original and compare it side by side.  The version I received looks like the ones you can buy from China.  It is not professionally sealed and the colours of the cover is too dark. It does not look like the one from the thumbnails.  You could bearly make out the beast's hair.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|Fáilte!    My guess is that the people that will like this DVD and CD as a top five star rating would generally be a marginal audience of traditional Irish Music without the big stage production to sell it.  I suppose it is just a matter of taste and there is nothing wrong in liking big stage productions.  But there is also nothing wrong in a preference for Irish Traditional Music the Irish traditional way in a much simpler and friendlier pub style form as roots music.    Between the two projects of this producer, my preference would be High Kings.  That is a simpler production that includes a pub style sing along for the \\"Irish Rover.\\" If there are more productions in the future, I would certainly encourage taking this direction.      I have been involved in playing and listening to Irish Traditional Music for decades.  The pub can offer what they call \\"craic\\"  (pronounced \\"crack\\") in Ireland, or an atmosphere of community fun and friendship.  This was captured in Danu's DVD \\"One Night Stand.\\"  This was captured in the Cheiftains DVD \\"Water from the Well.\\"  This was captured in Dervish's two DVD's, \\"Midsummers Night Session\\" and \\"Live from Johnny Fox's.\\"  On CD, this is captured on \\"Music from Matt Molloy's.\\"  I would also have to say the DVD \\"Ragus\\" presents a small theatre production PERSONAL approach to the same type of music.    Slán agaibh!

B00000JY1X|3.0|I fall on the side of the fence that a lot of people do with this release, which is to say that there's a perfect album in here, but it's buried underneath a mountain of so-so material. To be fair it's pretty rare for an artist to release a double (let alone triple) LP and not have that sort of criticism thrown at them, but that doesn't make it any less valid. That being said Stephin Merritt did put forth a fine effort here and hell, even the Beatle's White Album wasn't perfect, so hats off to him for giving us what he did: An enormous amount of wonderful music.<br /><br />Anyway, we're lucky enough to live in an age of hard drives and CD burners which gives us the power to make our own mixes and leave what we don't like behind. I decided to give this a shot with 69 Love Songs and, surprise, my mix turned out to be exactly half as long as the original. I called my brand new, 2 disc, version \\"34 love songs\\" and have stuck with it since. Some people might say doing something like that makes you a butcher of artistic intent, but I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with cutting out the fat for the sake of good taste. I just wish Stephin decided to do a little more of that himself.<br /><br />For the sake of sharing, here's my annotated mix:<br /><br />Disc one:<br /><br />1. Absolutely cuckoo<br />2. I don't believe in the sun<br />3. All my little words<br />4. A chicken with it's head cut off<br />5. Love is like a bottle of gin<br />6. I don't want to get over you<br />7.

B001GQ2TGA|3.0|I love Enya but I was a little disappointed in this recording.  It basically sounds like her others.  I could play one of the others and hardly notice.
B001IMR7EQ|3.0|I know people may say, \\"then watch the movie if you want the songs\\". I have, and i do. I was hoping that these songs were more like ripped from the movie exactly as heard, but these sound like the sing along tracks used during recording. some tracks lack things like sighs and yawn. while some poeple may like that, i rather the real thing. but rather minor problem, especially since i own the movie.    tim curry's songs are the best in my opinion. his feeling in the songs, especially i'm going home, are rather startling.     many people online have complained how simple the songs are in rocky horror, but they can go stuff themselves with olive flavored jello. i dont think these songs are supposed to have super deep philosophical meaning, but meant to sound great and be catchy. which they do greatly. i'd say this movie is right along with fiddler on the roof as one of the best musicals ever made.    now my biggest problem of all with this collection. NO SWORD OF DAMOCLES! That is the song played when rocky is just born, and is running from frank. very nice song, but no where to be found on this album.    my advice, rip the dvd of its songs. better feeling, all songs (if english version i think). much more work, but this is worth it. or just do like millions of others, play the dvd so many times that the laser cuts through the disc.    still this album is good to have. the prices of people walking by while im listening to tim curry sing sweet transvestite is rather enjoyable.
1841136514|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2KUWR1ZHEGRHU]]SECOND EDITION<br /><br />THE WANNABE BARRISTER'S BIBLE: BUY IT NOW<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor from Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Wannabe a barrister?  Then read this superb little book first.  You will be reliably, knowledgeably and entertainingly well informed as to what you're letting yourself in for - and once you've made it -- how to get ahead and stay ahead in this challenging profession.  We, and any other barristers we know who have read this book (recently released in a second edition by Hart Publishing), only wish it had existed when they were starting out.  It's a veritable treasure trove of hints and advice as to what to do and just as importantly, what not to do if want to become a barrister.<br /><br />The Bar - in this case, of England and Wales -- is one of the most interesting professional careers in the world as we know it, but nonetheless a career path fraught with problems, many of them those of other people.  It all starts in earnest, not necessarily when you acquire your academic qualifications - that's the easy bit - but when you aspire to acquiring pupillage, (the barristers' apprenticeship). Well, that's another matter!<br /><br />Note the author's warning that around a third to a half of all applicants who apply in any one year have no real chance of getting pupillage.  However,  if you still  think you can make it and want to have a go despite these gloomy odds, this book provides invaluable guidance as to how you can reach your goal.<br /><br />Not only will you learn more about the traditions, terminology and institutions of the Bar, you'll also experience life at the Bar as it is actually lived - vicariously, of course -- via the personal anecdotes of several barristers practicing in several different fields.  Emphasis on the practical is one of the many delights of this book.<br /><br />Considering the amount of painstaking research, effort and organisation that has gone into the writing of this book, Adam Kramer has certainly performed a sterling service for aspiring barristers everywhere.  Take a look especially at the suggestions for further research and enquiry and the incredibly useful websites mentioned.<br /><br />In addition, the author includes advice on transferring to the Bar from your present career, plus suggestions for alternative career paths if you decide that the Bar is not really for you.  Note that this second edition is fully up to date to account for recent changes to the Bar as we enter a period of further major review.<br /><br />FIRST EDITION<br /><br />This is a very much needed book, with useful online updates, for anyone interested in becoming a barrister-at-law in England and Wales in 21st century.<br /><br />There has always been a certain amount of mystique about the Bar and what we actually do. Adam Kramer has been able to distill the work we do in a matter-of-fact way as though he were addressing a jury- and he puts the issues across very finely indeed with most questions answered.<br /><br />Ex Bar Chairman, Stephen Hockman, introduces the book in a very friendly manner and then launches into the realities of life at the Bar and the sort of problems we are facing at the moment. He concludes that `I only wish it had been available to me when I started in practice 35 years ago' thereby identifying that today we have many new entrants to the profession from `outside' so they will not know much of the intricacies of professional life gleaned from parents and relatives.  This is a good thing because it shows the broad base which gives the Bar its unique talents for today.  And, of course, this sort of book is needed as it explains all those little things which happen which appear a bit odd to `outsiders' but are part of the traditions of the legal profession (and they work otherwise we would have got rid of them!).<br /><br />The book has 14 fact-filled chapters, and a most useful 'further information' section at the back to go with the glossary, index and `timetables for routes to the Bar'.  Probably the two biggest issues to be faced are well covered by Kramer: all aspects of money from paying fees to earnings; and `can you do the job?' With the regular suggestions of change to the way barristers are trained, I would expect more emphasis on continuous professional development and reflective practice at the Bar in future editions to meet current policy directives from our regulators.<br /><br />Since the book appeared, the Legal Services Act 2007 was given Royal Assent on 30th October 2007, and we are still assessing the main implications for reform so read the updates online.<br /><br />Clearly more changes will follow and I hope that readers will not be put off by some of the statistics produced by Kramer on `success rates' for pupillage, quoting 2004 levels with 1,251 passes for the BVC, and only 556 pupillages available.<br /><br />Since then, notwithstanding diversity policy which has failed, the situation has declined markedly and it would seem that big changes will have to take place to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of new barristers `in stock' to balance wastage.  The message comes clearly through that it is in the interests of no-one to see the Bar wound up and merged into some form of trial lawyer section of a big firm of City solicitors.<br /><br />So, do not be put off when you read this book! Kramer writes \\"it will then be for the reader, who knows his or her character and circumstances, to decide whether to seek to become a barrister\\". Yes, he has succeeded in giving an understanding of the process by which a person wants to become a barrister at a time of numerous (yet incomplete) changes to the system.  No book can ever give you the reality of what it is like to do pupillage as some many are so different.<br /><br />My pupillage was before the rules changed, and it was in a common law set with a general and varied practice whereas much training today will be in highly specialized areas of great value to the paying client.<br /><br />I was also lucky to have had a small drama scholarship and, with the two professions have much in common concerning fame, fortune and the daily grind of `jobbing' work, it was of help because pupillage selection committees often look for the `rounded person' who does not necessarily come from a straight legal background. The rewards are there and, for me, work at the Bar is giving fair representation to the under-privileged (that is, most of us) who have absolutely no idea about what those `guys in wigs' do.<br /><br />You do now, with Adam Kramer's great pocket guide on being bewigged but no longer bewildered.'.

0670020745|5.0|I am a full time care taker for my husband who had a massive stroke last year.  Since reading her book (I'm not finished, too many things on my plate). it does give me insight to what he might of been thinking and trying to tell us the first 5 weeks in the hospital (out of 10 weeks).  The last 5 weeks were in rehab.  I thank Jill for all the information in all areas after her stroke.  It is well worth buying her book, especially if some one close to you has had a stroke.  The ones who should really read this book are the professionals, staff, care providers who work with these patients.  I can't begin to tell you how many professionals, nurses, Respiratory Therapist, etc, etc.  did not know anything about strokes.  AND, we were in a good hospital....so they say.
1843864258|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo39UTIKZKZ3QNS]]OR WAS IT?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green chambers<br /><br />Lawyers will like this excellent little novel for their spare time reading. It's a one-off non-murder, and just the sort of thing for your brief case whilst waiting for your matter to come on in court.<br /><br />It's also a fictional crime book for lawyers who like the fine balance of legal argument pursuing a case through the different eyes of the leading participants with great attention to detail. So we have the lawyer, the doc, the judge and the copper, in fact all the ingredients of a great whodunit where we know who did it but was there a deception and a genuine mental illness? You decide.<br /><br />We're not going to spoil your story by retelling it so do read the different accounts by the participants. In a largely autobiographical work which gives the feeling of the time and the author's early years gaining his forensic experience, Wheatley depicts how he saves a person from the gallows at the very end of the capital punishment era by securing a verdict which leads Ms Earle to Broadmoor via the old Court of Criminal Appeal.<br /><br />But did she do it with the requisite intent? That is the question ... and the beauty of this story. She doesn't speak. The vacant expression on the face as if there is nothing there when you look into her eyes ... yes, you have probably had those clients, too, or even had them as staff! Wheatley dangles the facts with an imaginative flair throughout.<br /><br />What we found special about the silent lady, however, is that it is for you, the reader, to decide- did she do it intentionally, would she do it again, and was she properly punished for her offence, if any!<br /><br />Wheatley gives the clear impression that the prosecution did not get up to the standard of proof so we cannot be satisfied she `did it' within the meaning of murder. But was the judge was right to accept a verdict of `manslaughter by reason of insanity' whatever that really means to us as most will see it as not guilty because of the insanity and is another example of the confusion of current homicide laws and McNaghten.<br /><br />Throughout a reading of this novel we day-dreamed of Marshall Hall's biography which we first read 40 years ago when the law was perceived differently- he was, after all, the ultimate \\"firearms brief\\" with his special seat cushion and a genuine interest in hard cases.<br /><br />From Marshall Hall to the realms of fiction where there is Horace Rumpole who would remind me of his Penge Bungalow triumph and be steadfast with his `not guilty' pleas, and all those irritating expert witnesses who are always so emphatic, and the solid police officers who we hope do not make too many moral judgments anymore.<br /><br />Yes, Wheatley blends the ingredients well here so we have the best make-up of the good trial read with all the questions we would like to pose as amateur sleuths, or even trial lawyers.  It's a book for the individual to read alone, as we are all individuals at the Bar, or in the courtroom- sole traders par excellence.<br /><br />\\"I think Isabel `did it', but she didn't get away with it because she went to Broadmoor\\" my neighbour said to us. Hmm!  That's only what our neighbour said on that train as we whiled away the hours of travel going down to a country county court for a nice driving spate between the locals on a terrible country road (no, not Devon this time). We had caught the paralegal bug of reading whilst we waited.  And then we told our traveller: actually it's a true story (with a bit of embellishment), but did she wink at Derek at the end of it all, or not?  Make you own mind up. We know what we think, but we're not saying.<br /><br />ISBN: 9781843864257at really means to us as most will see it as not guilty because of the insanity and is another example of the confusion of current homicide laws and McNaghten.

From Marshall Hall to the realms of fiction where there is Horace Rumpole who would remind me of his Penge Bungalow triumph and be steadfast with his `not guilty' pleas, and all those irritating expert witnesses who are always so emphatic, and the solid police officers who we hope do not make too many moral judgments anymore.     Yes, Wheatley blends the ingredients well here so we have the best make-up of the good trial read with all the questions we would like to pose as amateur sleuths, or even trial lawyers.  It's a book for the individual to read alone, as we are all individuals at the Bar, or in the courtroom- sole traders par excellence.    \\"I think Isabel `did it', but she didn't get away with it because she went to Broadmoor\\" my neighbour said to us. Hmm!  That's only what our neighbour said on that train as we whiled away the hours of travel going down to a country county court for a nice driving spate between the locals on a terrible country road (no, not Devon this time). We had caught the paralegal bug of reading whilst we waited.   And then we told our traveller: actually it's a true story (with a bit of embellishment), but did she wink at Derek at the end of it all, or not?  Make you own mind up. We know what we think, but we're not saying.      ISBN: 9781843864257
B000PDZJ8U|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF RONIN.  Just wait a few more weeks for February 24, 2009, the official U.S. blu-ray version of this movie is going to be release.  I do not know why Amazon has not updated their website to pre-order this movie considering that you can do so online with Best Buy, Circuit City, and Frys.  So just wait, do not buy this one, plus the new and official U.S. version is about half the price of what Amazon is currently selling this edition at.  Again, just wait for February 24, 2009.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|This series would have been a great buy if it had worked.  We popped these discs in and they played on every dvd player we could find but there is something wrong with the discs.  They will not play every episode.  It's as if they get stuck because of a bad manufacturing.  I'm convinced it is not our dvd players.  It was very frustrating to have spent the money for the complete series and still not be able to watch every episode.  I don't have alot of faith in returning items and i'm not convinced we would recieve a better set anyways.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|For those who scream at the thought of traditional holiday music (like me!), here's a CD that manages to evoke the holiday mood while retaining some depth and substance.  \\"And Winter Came\\" will get you into the holiday mood without causing an overdose!    While a few cringe-worthy lyrics and the notable recycling of the lead track mar the overall impression, the album is nevertheless an ambitious and largely successful attempt at creating modern holiday carols without resorting to covers.    The one great, albeit anachronistic, surprise is \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" which alone would make the album worthwhile.  Is that electric guitar I hear?!?  The bluesy, retro-pop quality to this song is the most different thing I've heard from Enya since.... well, 1989.  It's certainly a forced fit on a holiday album, but the song is so good that I find myself not caring.  Is the lyric \\"could be 2010\\" a hint at the future style Enya intends to take?  I certainly hope so.

B0017ANAZO|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie, but I did. The Women, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett was a very nice surprise, in large part due to a stellar performance by Annette Bening and a couple of great cameos by Candace Bergen, Carrie Fisher, and Debi Mazar. Eva Mendez was perfect for her role, as was Debra Messing, and if I hadn't gotten distracted by Meg Ryan's overblown hair and lips, I'd give it a solid five stars. :-) As it is, I give it four stars and a solid thumbs up.<br /><br />A woman's three best friends find out that her husband is being unfaithful - do they tell her? Sure they do, but not before seeing for themselves that the poor schmuck never stood a chance against a hot tamale like Eva, the perfume girl at Saks. Guided by her mother's advice, Meg decides to let her husband have his little fling, knowing he'll get tired of his spicy and demanding chica pretty quickly. He does, and she thinks she's won, until she finds out the affair is still going on. This is a great story about the power of girlfriends, the power of women, and the power of forgiveness.<br /><br />Wronged wife Meg Ryan copes with the breakup of her marriage with advice from her friends and her mother, and in the process is transformed from a messy haired mess, submerged in nameless Mom-dom, into what she always wanted to be all along. a chic, gorgeous fashion designer who wows the world with her first collection. (This is the only part of the script that bothered me. It was a bit much, just like Meg's hair and lips.) Anyway, this transformation doesn't happen overnight, and along the way, Annette Bening's character absolutely shines as the best friend, who, in a moment of career panic, agrees to publish the messy details of her best friend's divorce. The schmuck is a muckety-muck on Wall Street, you see, and well... sex sells.<br /><br />The breakup between the best friends is even worse than the breakup of Meg's marriage. It's no coincidence that the name of this movie is \\"The Women\\", because that's what the movie is all about - relationships between women (the breakup of Meg's marriage is basically a side plot). Annette begs for forgiveness, but Meg cuts her off, just like she has her husband. Annette continues to be a friend behind Meg's back by helping her adolescent daughter cope with her parent's impending divorce. They eventually (of course) get back to being best friends in a great scene where they fight, hug, fight some more, and then do some more hugging. Just like real women. :-)<br /><br />Meanwhile, the poor schmuck of a husband is always in the wings (though we never meet him). Once he knew he was busted, he broke things off with Eva, and seems truly contrite. He's pining for his wife back, begging for a second chance to get to know the \\"new\\" Meg.<br /><br />Ultimately, just like she gave her friend Annette Bening a second chance at friendship, Meg gives her husband a second chance in their marriage. They're two different people now and we, as viewers, are supposed to believe that this couple is going to live happily ever after, despite his infidelity. Meg is no longer the mousy little mom who was willing to put up with an affair, and her husband has learned that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence.<br /><br />I'd say that the lesson of this movie was that we have to love ourselves before other people can love us. That if we love people, we forgive them, even if they've hurt us badly. Definitely a great chick flick movie (I enjoyed it much more than I did the last Sex In The City), and (shhh....don't tell anybody) but my husband actually enjoyed it, too.Women\\", because that's what the movie is all about - relationships between women (the breakup of Meg's marriage is basically a side plot).

0679720200|4.0|\\"The Stranger\\" is one of those novels that operates on multiple levels.  On the surface, it is the brief story of Meursault, a man who attends his mother's funeral, meets a new girlfriend, goes to work, helps a neighbor get revenge on a bad girlfriend, then ends up murdering a man and going to jail and trial.  It is an easy to read little book written/translated in an efficient Hemingwayesque style.  In some ways, not much happens.  In other ways, quite a lot happens. But throughout, the reader keeps wondering just where the story is going    On the next level, the book is about Meursault's existentialist view of life.  From his point of view, everything that happens to him simply happens.  When his mother dies...she dies.  If his girlfriend wants to get married, it is ok...they can.  If his boss transfers him to Paris, so be it.  If incarcerated, he will pass the time studying stones or watching the sky.  If he is sentenced to death....well, he dies.  Nothing is important.  Nothing really matters.    There are other levels as well, including one in which the story is an allegory for the European imperialist presence in Africa.  And so on.....    I was intrigued by this book.  Though short and easy to read, it provides a wealth of food for thought and discussion.  It is not, however, an uplifting book.  And frankly, I remain unsure about exactly why this book earned Camus a Nobel Prize.

0307237702|5.0|This one is great for reading aloud with your family on long trips. Obama, as a writer,  is an easy read. He packages his thoughts neatly and explicity, so you can pick up the conversation again at any point without losing the gist of it. You feel as if he's allowing you to really get to know him for who he is, and not for who a high priced publicist would want you to know. This book is exciting, and if you care about this country, it fosters that... if you haven't cared in the past, you will now.
0316017922|3.0|I have resisted Malcolm Gladwell until now. The two previous bestsellers, the pop-lit celebrity, the untamed uprush of hair, I just didn't want to become a part of the whole thing.    But, having heard him discuss the book -- specifically, the 10,000 hour rule -- on NPR one day, I decided it was time to see what all of the fuss was about. I still don't know.    Without question, Gladwell writes in easy-breezy nonfiction prose that moves briskly and evinces real -- and sometimes really enjoyable -- talent. But, \\"Outliers\\" suffers from all of the worst symptoms of the explosive pop-econ genre that has kept steady hold on at least a few spots on the nonfiction bestseller list seemingly every week since the dawning of the new millenium in titles like \\"Freakonomics,\\" Gladwell's own \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink,\\" \\"The Long Tail,\\" \\"Traffic,\\" and many imitators.    The research is one-sided, the arguments are anecdotal, and the conclusions are exaggeratedly profound -- and, it all marches in lockstep with the governing hypothesis.    Gladwell's thesis is that the conventional story of exceptional success by virtue of singular personal achievement is at best incomplete and may even be false. His alternative is a theory that combines some measure of innate talent with an intertwined set of specific variables like cultural history, available opportunity, and socioeconomic background and a set of seemingly random variables like luck, and circumstances of birth [non-cultural: things like month and year].    Not a bad theory in some ways, although I think that in his premise Gladwell is a little more willing than I to argue that \\"we\\" consider success to be an individual achievement and not a product of luck, timing, social and cultural circumstance, and opportunity. In fact, I would argue that in a culture where every award that is given to any individual is expected to be met by a lengthy thank you speech acknowledging the contribution to the individual's success of every relative, co-worker, family member and - ugh! - inspirational elementary school teacher the awardee ever came across, Gladwell's premise of a  mistaken cultural perception of success as an individual achievement is errant.    But, so is much of the book. Gladwell doesn't so much make an argument as he does lay out pre-cooked morsels of research and anecdotal evidence that attribute individual success to non-individual qualities.     For example, he argues that it was their's parents entrepeneurial backgrounds in the garment business that launched the succesful careers of a generation of dominant New York Jewish attorneys over more agrarian or manual labor-oriented Germans and Irish. In making this point, Gladwell fails to take up the question of what became of the Jewish children of the same generation who went on to form the country's leading organized criminal gangs or to flounder in some of the nation's worst ghettoes.     In Gladwell's reckoning, it was the combination of talent and good fortune that allowed Bill Gates to get in his 10,000 hours of practice and be game-ready when the software bubble was ready to be inflated. It was an assertiveness bred in a nurturing nuclear family and fine schools that gave J. Robert Oppenheimer the skills he needed to talk himself out of an attempted murder rap and into the head job with the Manhattan Project; while, equally brilliant but raised by a single mother, genius James Langan has been unable to finish a degree, get published or do much of consequence beyond win a quarter of a million dollars circus sideshow-style on a TV game.    If Gladwell's point is that a srong family, good parents, excellent schools and a couple of lucky breaks are at the heart of many of the world's success stories: I don't think he needed to publish. Conventional wisdom has held those things to be true for a long time.    He has some stronger points to make in cultural comparison, for example, offering a very plausible evaluation of elevated ratesof pilot error based on cultural norms of power-distance and in-flight communication between the captain and first officer. But, try as I might, I can't figure out what this has to do with \\"success\\" or the defininition of \\"outliers\\" that Gladwell provides.    And, he roams even further afield in offering - as though it were gospel - the explanation that rice paddy farming is to be credited for the excellence of Asian cultures in mathematics.    What Gladwell never seems to realize - or at least never explicitly writes - is that the thread that actually ties together all of his theories (Gates' 10,000 hours of practice, the success shown possible by placing low-income students into good schools that work them 7a-to-7p daily, the willingness of Asian farmers to work 3,000+ hours a year) is hard work. Call it what you want: economic privilege, cultural norm, revolutionary philosophy; whatever it is that gets a talented person into a position where they are willing to and do work harded than everyone else, with a couple of breaks, they will achieve more success.    The fact of the matter is that every one of Gladwell's examples takes advantage of the chances they get. Oppenheimer wouldn't take no for an answer, Langan does; Gates always found a way to get in another hour in front of a computer, others didn't; Asian students won't quit on a difficult math problem, Americans do.     So, race and income and family background dictate opportunity: color me less than shocked. Working harder than equally or less-talented persons will make you more succesful: not exactly covering new ground there.    Gladwell may have a winning writing talent; but, a poet philosopher he is not. Just goes to show that talent goes a long way.
B001CDLATE|5.0|PQ 5/5, Sound 4/5. The film was watched on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma, and BD30K Blu-Ray player.<br /><br />The film presents a worldly journey and without having read the film makers mission, an inevitable interconnectedness between cultures, socio-econimic statuses, and societal position was apparent throughout. Due to the powerful sound track, I felt as though I had been meditating for an hour and a half. Some of the images were beautiful,some were sad, and most were inexplicably stirring. This is a film that showcases humanity, for its unversality, and its relevance for the past and future centuries to come. The scenes are shown without reference to location, which increase wonder and speculation and really lends power to the images.<br /><br />The Making of Featurette was very interesting from a film making perspective, and there was some discussion about the locations and challenges faced in completing the film.<br /><br />If you are a hi-def enthusiast and enjoy documentaries and sturring cinema, this is one not to be missed. Roger Ebert was certainly correct in his assessment of naming this one the reason why Blu-Ray was brough to market. It's simply stunning and the pace and shots of the film will leave you breathless.
159562015X|2.0|I feel cheated having just finished the book and its online test. The book contains approximately 30 small pages of widely spaced text explaining the premise behind building upon one's strengths. The rest of the book is devoted to explaining the 34 different \\"themes\\" or strengths. These descriptions are only somewhat useful since most of the explanations are pretty much what you would expect based on the title of each theme. They also include examples of what types of people share each theme. The most useful part of the descriptions may be the couple of bullet points that provide helpful methods of dealing with people that fall under each theme. This is somewhat flawed though because it stands to reason that if you're talented enough at gauging people to be able to determine what their characteristics are you ought to be talented enough to know how to engage them. That said, there were a handful of pointers that I found useful.     I suspect that what you're really paying for with this book is the online test, which is really nothing more than a Myers Briggs assessment with some quick computer scripting to provide you some \\"personalized\\" suggestions and results. The test consists of 177 pairs of descriptors of which you are asked to select one from each pair which either strongly or somewhat describes you. Frustratingly, many of the pairs are not mutually exclusive in any way so you may have a very difficult time deciding which answer to select. I feel that in order to really make use of the test you probably have to know yourself quite well, in which case the book and the test will be of little value to you. I recommend anyone who is considering purchasing this book to first have a look at the variety of freely available Myers Briggs assessments online. They provide a very similar self assessment and often include the same detailed and personalized advice to complement the test.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This season of Lost presents many more questions than they answered which frustrates me and excites me at the same time. The show is constantly evolving, bringing new philosophy into the story. The characters are great, with much more to learn about each of them, even the ones from the beginning of season 1.     I love this show because it frustrates me. However it does not frustrate me due to plot or continuity issues. It frustrates me because it does not give everything away in one episode. It makes me wait, builds up the tension and reveals enough to satisfy and progress the show.     This is a great addition to the previous three seasons of the show. I cannot recommend this show any higher.

B000002ITW|2.0|I have two major problems with this album.  The first problem is a weird one - the first song, Suite Judy Blue Eyes, isn't actually on the CD.  It is listed as Track 1, but Track 1 is 26 seconds long, the first 8 seconds are silence, and the remainder is the very end of Suite Judy Blue Eyes (\\"da da da da da... da da da da da\\"), and that's it!  It is so bizarre, I am not sure how they can list it as a track.    The second is that I feel that many of the songs are played very sloppy.

1582701709|1.0|What Rhonda Byrne outlines in her book has been done many times before by many different past authors.  It's nothing new.  Visualize what you want, and you'll supposedly get it.  What's new is the enthusiasm which the public has fallen for this concept.    However, one must ask some simple questions.  If the concept worked so well (which I've tried without success for years before the Secret even came out), then why isn't Rhonda Byrne more successful?  As it is, she is a television writer and producer in Australia.  Of course, there's nothing wrong in that.  The problem is that she claims to have a technique with which we can get anything we want in life.  Why is she not a billionaire?  Why does she not have beautiful houses in the tropics?  Why is she not more successful in her regular job?  Why have we never heard of her outside of her book?     Simple.  The concept does not work.  And no, don't believe the laughable idea that she's \\"happy\\" at where she is in life.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I am really surprised that this movie does not have 5-Stars. I thought it was all-around perfect. I enjoyed the suspense, the romance, and the comedy too. It all mixed really well and the animation was great.<br /><br />The story is really cute. Wall-E is a robot with a somewhat lonely, monotonous existence on Earth where he collects junk and packs garbage that has been left all over the deserted planet. Then one day a spaceship lands and out comes a robot named Eve (who is referred to as EVVVVE-A throughout the movie). Wall-E is immediately enthralled by the persistently searching and destructive Eve and eventually becomes taken by her.<br /><br />This eventually leads him on a journey to the Buy-N-Large spacecraft where Earth's obsessed population now resides, where he and Eve find themselves in a situation where they must save the Earth.<br /><br />Eve and Wall-E really work well as a team in the movie and that is what I loved the most. Wall-E also is such an endearing character, he's scared but brave and also funny. I also was entertained [and slightly frightened] by the depiction of obese humans on the BuyNLarge ship. It seems to be a message about being overdependent and lazy because of technology. The way the earth went to waste also makes a message about people taking care of the Earth and making sure it does not get to that point. I liked that this movie did that but wasn't preachy about it. It didn't overtake the storyline.<br /><br />Bottom line, I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults. It's very well done.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought the DVD based on the positive reviews. If you are out of shape, the way I was, it is a good way to start getting back into shape.  My daughter and I both did the level one workout and we were both sore for a few days.  It went against everything I have ever learned, to do the same workout every day without a break, but I stuck with it, and after only 1 week, I could see and feel the difference.  I was able to switch to level 2 on day 7, and to level 3 by day 15.  When level three became two easy, I ordered Jillian's other workout series.  Now I do that 5 days per week and level 2 and 3 of this workout on the weekends.  I can't believe how strong my legs and stomach have become, and how much fat I have lost in less than 30 days.  The best part is, it takes less than 30 minutes to do. You definitely get a full workout in that time, since she combines upper body workout with lower at the same time.  Your legs burn if you do it right.  The only complaint I have, is that it is impossible to fast forward through the intro, but I use this time to set up my weights and mat, and put my shoes on.  I didn't lose the 20 pounds that the cover of the DVD claims I could lose (I only needed to lose 10 and I have so far lost 5), but it was well worth the $10.
B000002H48|5.0|They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Maybe the last important rock festival of the Woodstock Generation, No Nukes had a message as well as music.  Perhaps the message is dated, with the evolution of safety features built in to the nuclear industry today, but that's besides the point.  The music stands on its own as a testament to the power (pun) of the artists to galvanize a generation.  Who, in today's button-down business first world, could accomplish that outside of U2?   There are enough reviews of the music here with one exception-the criminal neglect of Poco's amazing performance of Heart of the Night.  Revisiting this track, in the aftermath of Katrina and all that has happened to that great city, one cannot help but get chicken skin listening to the heart-felt, poignant vocals of Paul Cotton.  As one reviewer stated, John Hall's Power was the highlight of these concerts and Poco's Heart Of The Night is right up there with it.  5 Stars just for these 2 alone and that's not taking into account all the other goodies scattered over the 2 CD's.  (And how about John Hall getting elected to Congress this year from a traditionally Republican stronghold in upstate New York!)     One other thing of note with these concerts....the music on the CD's is sometimes different from the film.  I broke out the old VHS tape and listened to Power and the Doobie Bros.' Depending On You.  These are different from the versions on the CD.  There were 5 nights of concerts surrounding the No Nukes movement and obviously, they cut and pasted what they thought were the best performances.  Why the discrepancies between the video and the CD?  It would be incredible for someone to put it all out or in some downloadable form that doesn't cost an arm and a leg for promotion and distribution.  People could pay a download service and be able to cherry-pick the performances they like.  The same should be done with Monterey Pop and Woodstock.  There are rare, whole performances of some of the60's generation's best loved acts just sitting and gathering dust.  Jeez, if you want to make some coin off us geezers, you better release this stuff while there's still some of us left to remember it.

Brisingr seemed to forget about Eragon's war against him for most of it and provided us with details, such as the politics of the dwarves, that seemed pointless to touch on. Why do we need half page descriptions of minor characters and scenes? I find it hard to believe that Paolini stringently followed the outline he made for this book as he did for Eldest. If you're a fan of the series I would recommend this book, but otherwise don't bother or at least wait until it comes out on paperback.
1594201927|5.0|Niall Ferguson's \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is an extremely well researched and highly readable history of financial evolution. The author shows that our financial history is a roller-coaster ride of ups and downs, bubbles and busts, manias and panics, shocks and crashes.<br /><br />According to Ferguson, there have been 148 crises since 1870 in which a country experienced a cumulative decline in GDP of at least 10 percent and eighty-seven crises in which consumption suffered a fall of comparative magnitude, implying a probability of financial disaster of around 3.6 percent per year.<br /><br />Even today, despite the unprecedented sophistication of our institutions and instruments, Planet Finance remains as vulnerable as ever to crises. \\"It seems that for all our ingenuity,\\" writes Ferguson, \\"we are doomed to be 'fooled by randomness' and surprised by 'black swans'. It may even be that we are living through the deflation of a multi-decade 'super-bubble'.\\"<br /><br />This book is recommended for all those interested in an excellent financial history of the world as well as those who seek to better understand the magnitude of the current economic crisis facing not only all Americans but the entire global community. It is likely to be with us for some time.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|The colors are so vivid, makes viewing this masterpiece even more enjoyable. I couldn't wait until the end of March to get it, so I canceled my pre-order and ordered it from Amazon UK (no regions on blu-ray). It took about a week to receive it and it cost me 24pounds ($36.31) with shipping. Totally worth the money!!!!
B000002VCU|4.0|This is half a \\"concept\\" album, with its second half (what was Side 2 on the original LP) being a satire of Las Vegas and/or compulsive gambling. As with all APP albums, the lyric content is light and obvious. But this one is particularly strong, musically, with a number of memorable tunes. The group works best in minor keys as the title cut demonstrates, along with several other album numbers. The most beautiful song, however, is the major mode \\"Time,\\" which IMO ranks among the loveliest tunes ever written.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|If you have a blue ray player then there is no movie you can get to better showcase the superiority of blu ray than especially the first installment of this movie trio. The special effects in all of them will show people why they too should buy a blu ray player but the first movie is of course the best of the three.<br />Awesome looking, better than theater quality from your own home. Blu Ray, as Howard Hughes would put it, \\"it's the wave of the future\\"!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|For the sake of avoiding hyperbole I'll try not to say this is one of the most enjoyable musical romantic comedies I have ever seen. But I will say that it is an absolute joy to spend an hour forty minutes watching actors appearing as though they are enjoying themselves. And in Mamma Mia, every actor seems to be - well, to quote one of the songs - having the time of their lives. It's a sitcom storyline; the young bride played by Amanda Seyfried secretly invites her three possible biological fathers to her wedding and, as the saying goes, hilarity ensues. A superb cast is in attendance - though Seyfried's Sophie the central character, Meryl Streep gets top billing, and delivers a landmark performance befitting her status as one of the greatest contemporary actresses. So much for avoiding hyperbole, huh? She looks slim, happy, and beautiful. Also along for this fun ride are Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, Christine Baranski, and one of my personal favorite actresses, Julie Walters, who is perhaps best known as Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter films, but I have also loved her in Billy Elliot and Educating Rita. The backdrop for all this fun is a seemingly timeless inn on a beautiful Greek island. All of the musical numbers are songs from the 70s Swedish vocal pop band ABBA. But wait. They are integrated beautifully into the story and Meryl Streep in particular shows a shocking capacity for acting through rages of emotion, in character while singing. And did I say it strongly enough? The absolute joy the actors seem to be having is infectious. You can't watch this movie while frowning. I don't care who you are, it will put a smile on your face. I watched the DVD from Netflix, and gave it 4 out of possible 5 stars in Netflix's rating system. Now I am going to buy it.  After I have watched it two or three more times I just might give it the full five stars that I usually reserve for Schindler's List league films. The DVD special features include an additional song that was deleted from the final edit, director comments, and a sing-along mode in which the lyrics are displayed during songs in karaoke fashion. The DVD was released December 16th in North America and November 27th in Europe. I recommend everyone give it a spin.onal song that was deleted from the final edit, director comments, and a sing-along mode in which the lyrics are displayed during songs in karaoke fashion.

B001C08RHA|1.0|I know movies should be bigger than life, but come on. How much jet fuel does a single armor suit carry? I did not see any fuel tanks. Or does the magical energy source, I guess heart energy? produce a jet propellant reaction. let us not forget that 1/4 of an inch of steel will stop any bullet, especially .50 Caliber rounds.   Truly mindless entertainment for 30 year old children.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|I refuse to watch the movies on these discs anymore, for example, the Aliens disc has two films on it, with a maximum bit rate of 4 Mbps, even the Fox title runs 8 Mbps, the quality of the actual film is on a par with a video recording taken from analogue TV, it really is that bad.    It's a disgrace to have this done to the greatest Sci-Fi film of all time, shame on you Fox, lets hope you do these films justice with the Blu Ray release, if it ever comes out.........
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I agree wholeheartedly with Richard O's review, modern \\"Bread and Circuses\\" for a morally bankrupt society. Trifling entertainment for 30 year old children who are too brainwashed and fascinated with digital junk to look around and see that Rome is burning. A great cast of actors who obviously needed a quick buck. Christian Bale should go back to making real movies like \\"Rescue Dawn\\" and \\"Empire of the Sun\\" movies that mean something, movies that portray ordinary people in extraordinary situations. In other words REAL entertainment that does not involve digital explosions and shootout after shootout. I can't believe this movie rose to the rank of number 2 grossing movie of all time! It saddens me to think of a nation and a world that eats this garbage up, beating out movies like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" which portray real heroes. Batman got old 15 years ago, at least \\"Superman\\" was super, all batman has is money, but hey, we are a nation that worships money.
0393061310|3.0|I won't give a synopsis of the book as there are plenty of other good reviews that cover that.  I'll just say I found this book to have a fascinating and compelling argument for why history has gone the way it has.  I did not find it to be racist or even biased as the author goes to great lengths to explain his every viewpoint and provides plenty of valid reasons against any kind of bias.      The biggest flaw of the book, in my mind at least, is that it is terribly repetitive.  Diamond repeats the same points and conclusions many times. It gets to the point where you feel that entire pages could have been cut out and the book would have lost nothing.  Aside from that however, it is an entertaining and informative read.
031236198X|5.0|I see the thinking that these penguin's had today in many businesses. The majority of those people are older more mature individuals who are set in their ways and do not want change. This book was and is an easy read plus it gives the reader hope that any organization can change with the right  leadership. As with the penguin's, someone has to take charge an lead the rest of the organization. If you are ordering this book, I assume that you are that person! So enjoy!!!
0879309210|3.0|I love Dan's books. He covers a lot of ground on \\"how\\" to repair guitars. But... I want to know more about the \\"why\\" along with the how. Why a bone nut and not a Tusq nut, why one type of lacquer versus another. etc.  This is an untapped area in the guitar repair book area.  Still love everything Dan does, just wish for more detail...

B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-E is a fun movie that both young and old will enjoy. Being old I really enjoyed the use of the music and songs and video from Hello Dolly. I didn't appreciate the not so subtle 'save the planet' theme but I was able to over look it for the entertainment value.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I have tried other, lower priced brands, but find that the Canon brand holds a charge much longer, produces significantly more pictures per charge and has a life expectancy up to twice as long.  Pay a little more up front but expect to come out ahead over the long term.

1433502410|4.0|The ESV study Bible is a fantastic study tool.  I thought it was an incredible bargain at 50$, now I see it's for sale at 31$...amazing.  The real bargain is the access you receive to the online edition.  With the purchase you get a code whereby you can set up your own online study bible. It has everything the print edition has plus you can add your own notes. It's easy and with so many other online and software commentaries available, cutting and pasting in your own notes is great.    The only knock I have against this edition is that it's very non-commital in its notes. My old Ryrie is unabashedly dispensational, pre-millenial, etc.  I don't always agree with it, but I like it that they make a firm statement rather than using the ESV's tactic of saying, \\"some scholars say...\\"  In the end it's kinda like the Laodicean church in Rev. Seeing that my favorite sem. prof.  T. Schreiner is the N.T. editor I was a little dissappointed (but he was sort of like this in class too... non-commital- yet very humble in his own opinion).
B001EOQWEO|5.0|One of the best movies of 2008.  The shipping was really really slow, even though I pre-ordered it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The Holiday is a warm movie that has tinctures of compassionate and caring threads woven in - such as kate's friendship with an octogenarian neighbor. The quaint english cottage is tiny and adorable - especially the bathtub bathroom, the shmaltzy voice of cameron's subconscious is a hilarious detail and the snow driven english countryside is evocative of the classic xmas card scenes. I found jack black miscast and unbelievable as cameron's ex though he did a creditable job throughout. The movie shows women redrawing their relationship boundaries into a healthier shape, as more self love and positive energy shines through. A great feel good movie!
0143058525|4.0|A good read. The first section \\"Eat\\" is a little disappointing, but Pray, Love make up for any disappointment.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|This is a marvellous movie. The level of imagination, work and style is breathtaking and as a jaded 44 year old I deeply loved it.  However: where's the HD audio, where's the serious extras (if any movie deserves a production analysis documentary then this one does - there IS one on the disc but it's flimsy) and WHY IS MY BOX BROKEN?!  The last question is a real bone of contention. Some multi disc Blu-Ray releases are packaged in a standard sized box with a moving section inside to accommodate the extra discs. I've got three of these boxes (Firefly, Speed Racer, When we left the Planet) and two have been broken on arrival. The plastic used is totally inadequate for the hinge mechanism required to move the disc flap and also it will not accept super-glue. It's astonishingly poor quality design and materials and I can guarantee I'm not the only person with broken boxes. Please stop using this design you manufacturing types!

0375842209|5.0|One of my book club members recommended this book for our group telling us it was really written for a younger audience.  I wan't too thrilled with the prospect of this book and when it arrived and I saw how long it was, I was really daunted.       After starting the book, I couldn't put it down.  I thought, oh no another story about the Holacaust, but I was captivated.  I adored the characters and did not want the book to end.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

386521584X|5.0|Great book, not much new to say about it.  But I find it fantastically inspirational in that it again show a series of very successful images based in vision and imagery instead of tools and mechanics. For today's photographers its very easy to get trapped in megapixel and the latest lens race.. this is a book shot for images.  If you are a photographer or into photography, just buy the book and start enjoying, you will come back to this over and over again.
1595478728|5.0|This classic collection of essays by the writer of The Father Brown Mysteries is filled with revelations. Of particular interest is the piece titled \\"The Ethics of Elfland.\\" That essay changed my life.<br />I have to say that, for a modernist such as myself, reading Chesterton's works is a great challenge. His use of  language is tedious at times - that is, until you get to know him. Then, his logic and his humor become pure, exaltive revelation. There is no one quite like Chesterton in our time.<br />Many reviewers approach his writings purely from a Christian view point. But, that is really not essential. These essays are for everyone, religious or not. They are all about common sense and logic.<br />Getting back to the Ethics of Elfland mentioned above: Read just that essay - with patience and an open mind, and you will become a child again -at heart.
0312321376|5.0|I am not religious or an atheist, I am a scientist and I honestly think it is through science that we will find \\"proof\\" of what reality is. This book is presented by a scientist, and it documents cases of thousands of young children who seem to remember past lives. Often this is the first thing these children will talk about, an obsession with a family they want to find again, and then are able to locate despite never even having been to the city where the former family is. Very compelling evidence and it really will make you think. Not every case is rock solid and the authors don't try to make them so, they simply present what they found. As with anything human nothing is perfect. Many of the cases will raise the hair on the back of your neck or make you cry. Of particular interest to me was the Buddhist practice of marking a corpse so that when the person is reborn they will bear the birthmark showing the family who the reincarnated spirit is. Sound absurd? I kinda thought so too until I read some of the cases, which have been scientifically studied and documented by the University of Virginia. Seriously, if you even slightly consider reincarnation as a possibility (over half the world's population considers it fact) then you should read this book.

B000WGWQG8|1.0|Ordered this DVD set as a Christmas gift for my son in Chicago.  It has never arrived.   I contacted the seller twice and have not gotten a reply.    Usually my Amazon.com orders arrive quickly and in good condition, so I was very surprised that it didn't happen with this one.       I do understand that items can be lost, especially during the holiday season, but think it is very poor business to not respond to the inquiry of my purchase.    I will be surprised if I get my money back.
1401322425|2.0|I was disappointed in this cookbook. In fact, it arrived in bad condition due to poor packaging and rather than have it exchanged for another one, I chose to return it and get my money back. The book seemed to ramble on and on rather than having a clear, concise segment for recipes. A lot of it is show casing jamie's garden and there is a lot written on how/when he gardens and what to plant. I really didn't expect that and for those who are looking that type of book, this book will be great. The photos are beautiful and and there's a lot of text. If this is the sort of book you're looking for you will enjoy it. I personally was hoping for a lot more recipes and less verbage.  I don't consider this a \\"cookbook\\". I consider it more of a lifestyle book.
006136472X|3.0|Follett takes a set of not quite believable characters and blends them together into a story that flows smoothly.  If you like espionage, intrigue and sex mixed in with a little Mafia, a touch of academia, a smidgen of nuclear threat, and the high seas, you'll probably like this book.  As in so many modern American novels, the firm porn (midway between soft and hard) is a little monotonous unless you happen to have a bit of the peeping Tom in you.  Like so much in this fantastic story it is contrived but folded smoothly into the storyline.  When I began skipping over the heavy breathing and anatomical explorations the story improved measurably.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I just HAD to add my two cents worth to counter those one-star naysayers.  I never did enjoy a musical on the silver screen until I saw 'Mamma Mia'.  I actually went to see this movie for one thing and one thing only -- the MEN (well, two in particular: Brosnan and Firth).  I walked out of the movie theatre smiling, my 13-year-old daughter and I gushing about how awesome it was.  Yes, it's true, Brosnan can't sing but Firth has a decent enough voice (though he only did one number).  Streep, too, has a surprisingly good pair of lungs; her girl friends made for a strong supporting cast, both in the acting and the singing.  To those who don't think this movie is realistic, simple arithmatic will tell you that a 20-year-old girl in the 00s was NOT born of a relationship in the 70s!  So who cares?  It's just a fun movie -- watch it, enjoy it and stop mulling over every little detail!  I don't think the guys would enjoy this movie as much but, hey, we sit through enough shoot-'em-ups with them that they can watch this with us!  Ultimately, there will be two camps: the people (women) who loved the movie and those (men) who hated it.<br /><br />About this Two-Disc Special Edition, I'm not sure what the other disc is since I bought the Full Screen edition.  The Full Screen edition was bare-bone basic consisting of only the disc itself and no inserts whatsoever so that was disappointing.  Maybe the Two-Disc edition will offer more (but it's good only if you have a WS telly).

I watched it a second time to make certain that I knew what was going on with just as much awe.      Try a slow frame advance on the fight sequences.     Dreamworks definitely proved with this movie it was competition for Pixar.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|What a waste of the huge talent line up! The first 10 minutes are indeed funny as many have pointed out but it's downhill all the way thereafter - 2 hours of downhill. Perhaps I didn't understand things. I'm a Brit and have lived in the US for 15 years and should have no problem with comprehension. I understood about 50% of what was said - and 100% of the frequent use of the F and S words. Steve Coogan, the wonderful Alan Partridge, was completely wasted.    Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't bother to go to a theater. This is an expensive waste of time.

All I care about is what happens when I put it in the machine and sit down to watch.  For me, that's the first time, and the movie is New and Original.  And all I can say is, Tom Cruise is very, very good at what he does, and the world knows it.    Woo's direction is excellent, with a good deal of that HongKong dazzle we've all come to love.  Fine by me.  When I watach escapist flicks I don't expect realism, and don't really want it.  But, I thik that what makes MI-2 as watchable as it is, is Cruise's persona; not his personality, but the clever use of his unusual and still unusually handsome face, coupled with his relatively small, wiry  body.  I think it was Salinger who said that actors were best served by havin small or relatively small bodies.  It lends their movement -- particularly acrobatic or athletic movement -- an extra sense of spacial excitement.  Big action actors like Schwartzenekker don't have that extra physical excitement, thogh they're as agile and move as well, simply because they're so big.  Size makes them look slower.  (Watch Donald O'Connor dance beside Gene Kelly.  Kelly's good but Donald's flying!)  In this film Cruise's stunts, like his high jumping or slithering down cables have an ariel circus kind of excitement.  Personally, the opening mountain-climbing sequence filmed out in the Arizona high sandstone formations, hooked me.  An acrophobic with a keen fear of heights, bare-handed climbing, alone, drives me wild, and when he slipped, or appeared to slip and fall maybe 20 or 30 feet down the face of the cliff, I let out a yell.    As for the rest of it, trick driving and particularly trick motorcycle stunt driving; I bought it.  I love bike riding, thogh I never do any trick riding, and these sequences, like those in MATRIX RELOADED were thrilling.    Leading Lady?  Thandie Newton (as \\"the Girl\\") did what she was supposed to do: she made Tom look great; ie., sexy and desireable.  But, Newton?  She was far more interesting and had more to do in RIDDIK, and made Karl Urban sexy by appearing to be attracted to him.  Action Heroes require particulr kinds of actresses, and more often than not they must be exotic in some way.  One remembers Rae Dawn Chong paired with Arnold, and of Grace Jones with Schwartzenekker, again, as Konan, and then playing beside Roger Moore's James Bond in VIEW TO A KILL.  The idea seems to be, the greater the contrast between them, the greater and more exciting will the attraction appear.  What happen to these actresses?  Diesel's uber-heisse Bohemian squeeze in XXX; what ever happened to her?    Negative:  Waste of Ving Rhames.  Great face/head; great voice, but where was he?  Miscast as a computer geek locked up in a van.    More selling points?  The bad guys are convincing and well-played.  The gadgets are as good as the WMD bacillus of the story.  Plus, or make that a double-plus, the music is good and the sound is GREAT!  Gives my Home Theatre set-up a workout.    All I can say is, its a hell of a lot of fun!

0788815490|5.0|Transferring or adapting literature to the screen successfully, is so difficult, producers don't do much of it anymore, except for the BBC folks.  But if you're an Henry James reader and admirer, you're probably amazed that this American expatriate writer so eminently unsuitable for contemporary popular entertainment, is sometimes adapted so exceedingly well, that after viewing one is prompted to re-read the original story or novel, and to make a comparison with the film or films.  And if they balance, well...  It is indeed remarkable.    Helena Bonham-Carter has done so many things so well, fans of hers will be pleased with her take on this nearly tragic character.  This is the story of a young woman whose life, half-ruind by her parents misfortunes, is tested by her own youthful passion -- withdrawing from a life of respectable prostitution in the form of a loveless marriage to a rich, dissolute man, in an effort to avoid a nearly certain life of probable, plebian  prostitution driven by want -- she finds a way to manipulate her way to eventual riches and romantic/erotic happiness; a way that very nearly works.      Linus Roache plays her lover or inadvertant co-conspirator in a sexual ponzi scheme.  He underplays a character that appears to be under-written if only because although his character is that of a very nice, principled young English journalist -- slim, blonde, vague -- he is seen, or better, realized, through the perception of the two women who love him.  This is an actor whose ability appears to be to insinuate himself into roles in successful films -- like RIDDIK -- and TV series -- like LAW AND ORDER.  He's a kind of chameleon and that's very much to his advantage here, in this sory of shifting values and shades of desire; he becomes, or appears to become, whatever it is we wish him to be.    The titian-haired ALLISON ELLIOTT plays the innocent, loving and generous American heiress who -- as the story implies -- goes to London in hope of a cure fora fatal disease, and then goes on to Venice, to love and then to die.  She is not given a headline place on the credits for the film, though she deserves them.  Her outward beauty and physical appearance is very much of the period. Pre-Raphaelite/Byzantine, but her presence is animated by a simplicity of response that demonstrates her want of guile better than anything can or possibly could.  She plays a woman unfettered by either economic or psychological want, and the memory of her performance, like the memory of the dead woman of the story, liingers, ineffable as sunlight on rippling water.    This is a very fine film and well worth watching; the Venetian photography is breathtaking.   The musical score is so very good one could as easily say WINGS OF THE DOVE is equally worthy of hearing.  If you buy it you will very likely play and watch it more than once, and if  you add it to other adaptations of Henry James novels and stories -- like THE GOLDEN BOWL, or DAISY MILLER, or THE BOSTONIANS, or TURN OF THE SCREW or any of the others, you will have added something valuable to your persona, though it would be presumptuous of me to say what that might be.  However, if entertainment for you consists in part in watching actresses give exciting performances, then you will probably enjoy the film adaptation of James' WASHINGTON SQUARE, entitled THE HEIRESS, which stars Olivia de Haviland.  In THE GOLDEN BOWL Uma Thurmon gives a star performance so outstanding, it seems incredible that she is not recognized as the great young actress she is.  Vannessa Redgrave, Michelle Pfeiffer and Sybil Shepherd among others have given performances in film adaptations of Henry James' stories, that stand very high in the lists of their accomplishments.    But, if you have ever loved anybody that death has taken from you, you will understand the depth and significance of this film.  If you haven't had the experience, you may well learn what it means.
0571202284|5.0|There are a million books who teach you how to start to animate (making bouncing balls, etc) - but this is the one that may actually take you further. It doesn't only explain how animation works in the movie, but also in real life - what does it mean to be an animator. Excellent book and very reasonably priced.
0060574216|5.0|I used to think that my behavior was unusual until I read this book.  Now I understand that men and women ARE from different planets and that it is normal for us to behave the way we do!  The book is loaded with tons of good information regarding the communication and relationships between men and women.  As with most books, it is not always easy or second nature to practice what we learn.  I found the section on writing \\"Love Letters\\" very interesting and helpful.  I think all married couples should read this book!
1400095204|4.0|What do we collectively know about the nation of Biafra? Images of starving children and the vague memory of a benefit concert come to mind. However, this historical novel will fill you in on many aspects of what this country was about - I say \\"was\\" because Biafra existed for 3 years only, at the end of the 1960's, when the Igbo people attempted formed their own nation by seceeding from Nigeria. The solid story arc is held together by a 13 yr houseboy, who interacts with a cast of well drawn and sympathetic characters, making it a page turner till the very end
B001IZFXMQ|4.0|I loved this production of World War Z. It was very entertaining. I was a little skeptical about getting it at first, because I don't normally like abridged audio books, and I was doubtful a story about zombies would really capture my attention. I gave it a shot though and was thoroughly rewarded. Each of the characters are voice acted by different actors/actresses, including some big names such as Alan Alda, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Jon Turturro, and about 15 others. The storyline and writing were excellent.<br /><br />I'm very unhappy that the audiobook is abridged though. I really wish they wouldn't do that for any book.
0061537934|5.0|Maybe it's because I love dogs -- or because I was on vacation -- but this book was the perfect fit for me. Light, but not too light.  Poignant, but not a downer. It's not a thriller, nor a challenging read... but, for me, it was a page-turner all the same.  It made me think of my own life, and my own dogs, and the ups-n-downs of both.  Very, very sweet book!
0307346617|5.0|Anybody who gives this less than 5 stars needs to have his/her head examined.  Wonderfully original spin on the zombie genre.  While not overly heavy on the gore, Brooks thoughtfully leaves this to the reader's imagination.  Amazing character development for what is essentially a collection of short stories.  I've heard there is a movie in the works; it will undoubtedly be a disappointment.
1416562605|2.0|Adiga has done us a favour by writing this book. My first reaction was that it's brilliant in conception, and it brings out a lot that the Indian media tends to sweep under the carpet. It's not flashy, and it's a simple tale.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is a  book written to shock a Western audience - and does it succeed! Nothing wrong with that, except that the author should have put in more effort to get all his facts right. There weren't too many Punjabi farmers in Gurgaon, for example. Most drivers live in squalid conditions , yes, but they don't live in the same complexes as their \\"masters\\". They live in separate ghettos.<br /><br />What's a more serious flaw is that the book portrays a \\"darkness\\" vs \\"light\\" angle, which is very common in Mumbai, which I understand is where the author lives. It's true that Bihar - the state Adiga doesn't name - is worse off than the rest of India. On the other hand, there is enough poverty in Mumbai to write about. IMHO, it's a typically urban Indian stereotype that Bihar is the pits but Mumbai is the New York or Shanghai of India.<br /><br />I would have loved it if it didn't have these flaws.
0446402389|4.0|It is 3:06 A.M. and I've just finished the last page of Child44.  The novel is set in Stalinist Russia (Stalin dies during the course of the tale).  The hero, Leo, is at the beginning of the story a proud member of the Russian intelligence agency, MGB.  His job is to ferret out spies and counter-revolutionaries.  Without revealing too much of the plot, suffice it to say that Leo becomes involved in a covert investigation into a possible serial murderer.  The novel is slow going at first but steadily picks up momentum until you have to stay up late, like me, to reach the very satisfying ending.  I'm hoping that Child44 is just the first novel in a series featuring this surprisingly likeable detective.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I had basically wandered away from the Material Girl since her Ray of Light days.  The Cd's since then have to me featured a good song or two but for the most part they felt lackluster and orchestrated for style more than substance.  However Hard Candy sees Madonna back in fighting form.  Now let's be honest.  Madonna has never been the best singer in the world, but she does have an uncanny ability to reinvent herself and to make music that is infused with danceability, and fun.  On Hard Candy she proves that she still has the stuff to rule the charts.  The lyrics here are good, the beats are off-the-chain, and almost from beginning to end there is a consistency of high quality production that recent Madonna CD's have been missing.  I absolutely love Hard Candy I hope that the next CD is as good or better.

B001C46P2A|5.0|I've seen this movie seven times.  I keep going back because the story is compelling.  As one of the characters says, \\"You've been on a journey.\\"  AUSTRALIA takes you on a journey with a young member of the stolen generation, played charmingly by 12-year-old Brandon Walters.  It's about changing hearts, sacrifice, and finding love in the Northern Australia territory during World War II.  There's a cattle stampede, murder, and the Japanese bombing of Darwin two months after Pearl Harbor.  Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Brandon Walters are excellent. The audience has applauded at the end of every showing I've attended.  Comments I've heard from other audience members have all been positive.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|This was a great fun inspirational film.  Innocent and charming (well, with some small sexual innuendos).  But, here's how I see that some people will be divided on its overall appeal:<br /><br />For people who've heard of ABBA and may know a couple of their songs, this film will definitely make you wanna run out and buy some ABBA CD's.  For those of us (like me) who already have all of ABBA's CD's and have cherished ABBA all their life, these actors singing ABBA songs is rather dull and much less energetically expressive than the ever-vivacious vocal outbursts of Annafrid and Agnetha (the original girls of ABBA).<br /><br />The original songs from ABBA have incredibly talented harmonizing and enthusiasm.  None of these actors can hit the notes like Agnetha and Annafrid (also known as Frida) did in their day.  And especially Pierce Brosnan. This was an embarrassing transition from being a former James Bond.<br /><br />However, I'm glad to see a movie made as a musical to many of ABBA's fabulous songs.  Pick up ABBA's greatest hits on CD, or just go ahead and get all eight of their original albums.  You will be in for a treat!<br /><br />Let me give you one good example of the girls of ABBA belting their voices out so strong.  Go to YouTube and listen to ABBA's version of \\"Chiquitita\\", and concentrate of the voices and the fabulous background orchestration.  It is one of the greatest songs they've done which is a great example of their enormous talent.  ABBA will never be topped.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|The first time I had downloaded a whole album.  I like all but 2 songs and wish I could have downloaded the singles.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire deserves a place among the masterpieces of world cinema.  Praise is pouring in for this brilliant film, directed by Danny Boyle from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup.<br /><br />The settings move from the bleakest - the slums outside Mumbai, where our hero, Jamal Malik, lives as a child with his older brother Salim - to high rise vistas and no less than the Taj Mahal.  The story ranges from the worst despair and heartbreak to the noblest sacrifice and most romantic love.<br /><br />We are introduced in the opening moments to the young adult Jamal, played by Dev Patel.  He is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and has just answered the ten million rupee question prior to the end of the show.  His next question will be worth twenty million rupees, an unimaginable fortune to the average Indian.  The arrogant, primping star of the show, played with artificial charm concealing an oily narcissism by Anil Kapoor, cannot stand that young Jamal is stealing some of his spotlight, and believes that the young, uneducated \\"slumdog\\" is cheating.  (One of the key sequences involves the host \\"proving\\" to himself that Jamal MUST be cheating.) Jamal has been handed over to the police, who torture him to make him confess his deception.  This moment in Jamal's life frames the rest of the film, told in flashback, and explains the torturous road that allowed Jamal to answer even the most difficult questions.<br /><br />We are not told about Jamal and Salim's father, but in an early sequence we see their mother murdered in a brutal religion riot as club-wielding Hindu's attack a Muslim slum.  Orphaned, Jamal and Salim live in the trash dump at the edge of the slum.  They befriend another orphan, the young girl Latika.<br /><br />The remainder of the film fills in the gaps of the lives of Jamal and Salim and Latika, who call themselves the Three Musketeers, but only got far enough in school before the murder of their mother to learn the names Athos and Porthos.  Along the way they encounter police brutality, orphanage directors who make Fagin and Bill Sykes look like Mother Teresa, as well as Indian gangsters and other people-traffickers.  Several sequences show us that Salim is becoming hardened by their harsh life, although he retains a degree of love for Jamal.  For his part Jamal makes the most of what life gives him. He only resorts to the criminal activities Salim sees as the only way to make it out of necessity.  At two different times Jamal is heart-breakingly separated from Latika, and at one level the entire film is a love story about Jamal's single-minded dedication to reunite with the only girl he ever loved. (Nine astonishing performances are given of the \\"Three Musketeers\\" at three different ages of life, and it is appropriate to give credit to Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubiana Ali as the youngest Jamal, Salim and Latika as well as Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar as the just-past-puberty versions.  Dev Patel and the beautiful Freida Pinto may become international sensations as the adult star-crossed lovers.  Madhur Mittal has less screen time as the adult Salim, but his character plays an important role.)<br /><br />The faint-hearted should know that the language could appear on American television and that there is no nudity, but the violence, in particular two torture scenes, are flinch-inducing.<br /><br />Slumdog is a piece of fiction - a fantasy - but it includes real emotions and believable human characters.  I walked from the theater feeling a little better about being alive, and knowing that I had just viewed a stunning artistic achievement.<br /><br />One of the inequities of the movie business is that a film like this can only open in a few theaters in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and take weeks to arrive at \\"lesser\\" destinations like Atlanta and Houston and St. Louis, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua opened nationwide on thousands of screens. I'm just sayin'.of screens. I'm just sayin'.
B0012GMUOU|4.0|Jeff Beck still relevant. I've got a fair bit of Becks music over the years, as well as most other notable guitarists like SRV, Tommy Bolin, Gary Moore, Steve Morse, Steve Howe, Robin Trower, Roberet Fripp etc.  I think this CD and Who Else shows that Jeff Beck is still wanting to keep updating his techniques & styles after his more commercial successes of Blow by Blow, Wired, There & Back.  This newer style is grungy, thick, techno or whatever but top notch as usual and I think proves that some of these older guys can show the younger, flashier jerks that they still have a long way to go to be mentioned in the same sentence as the legends. Worth adding this one to your collection, sound quality great and it's not even remasterd! (what a rip off some of these supposed remasters are, there are albums recorded properly 20 or more years ago, so why dont these remasters sound way better with the technology thats around)
B000000JO3|5.0|This classic hardcore release needs more reviews, it should have about 500 or more like other classic bands I think.  I am totally into old school hardcore punk, and Minor Threat, Black Flag, Fear, D.R.I (early), Circle Jerks, Germs, Bad Brains, and Dead Kennedy's are essential listening for early bands of the genre.    The first thing I noticed when popping in this disc is how well it sounded, not distant or underproduced like some early 80's bands; it stomps on you right from the start and keeps spitting in your face track after track.    Let's face it in todays world, it hasn't really gotten any better, perhaps worse and anyone who could relate to the anger and angst in this classic release will find it suits todays world just as well as it did back then. If you want to scream at the world for all the corruption and lies, all the B.S you put up with on a daily basis, just crank this one up and I guarantee you'll instantly feel better....even happy, I know it always makes me happy to hear it.

B0015OKWL2|3.0|Putting two of the most legendary stars of all time together in a movie is always a big gamble.  Expectations are immediately heightened, which puts extra pressure on the filmmakers to make a better-than-average film.  Looking back at projects with great duos like Fight Club or The Bucket List, one has to consider how much less spectacular they might have been with a cast of lower caliber actors.  On the other hand, sometimes superior acting can save an otherwise dull or disappointing film.  As for Righteous Kill, even the combined skills of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro could not hide the fact that the film's premise was far better than its execution.<br /><br />Following the opening credits, we see DeNiro through a video camera confessing that he is a rogue cop who has killed fourteen people.  As his narration continues, we step back in time a short while where we are formally introduced to longtime partners Turk (DeNiro) and Rooster (Pacino).  They are obviously the best of friends, but DeNiro seems to be headed down a dark road with Pacino unable to stop him.  The story goes on to reveal that a serial killer is on the loose who leaves handwritten poems at every crime scene telling why each person was murdered.  Partners John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg challenge the older detectives for the case, which eventually leads them to an odd suspicion.<br /><br />The acting is good all around and the twist is sensational!  Unfortunately there are many other elements that interfere with the movie's overall impact.  First, the editing leaves much to be desired as many of the scenes appear to have been cut short, diminishing their potential to affect.  Second, the script contains a number of one-liners that make even these amazing actors come off sounding cheesy at times.  Third, the film drags at times because little time is spent developing the relationship between the leads.  (Heavies like these deserve and require a solid foundation in order to give the movie depth.)  Lastly, the final act is lame and predictable following the twist.<br /><br />The best that can be said about Righteous Kill is that having Pacino and DeNiro together is awesome no matter what.  If you happen to be at the video store and nothing else is jumping out at you, then rent this film.  It does have its moments. Besides, isn't a Pacino/DeNiro team-up something that you just have to see anyway?final act is lame and predictable following the twist.

0316017922|4.0|I loved the book for some powerful ideas and great stories - rice farming in Asian countries leading to their mathematical prowess, explaining Korean Air's poor record of safety, explaining success of Bill Gates, Bill Joy & Steve Jobs, etc. Gladwell makes the point very effectively that \\"self-made man\\" is rarely true for most successful people. Where I found the book doing a really poor job is that all examples are presented without any counter arguments - there is no balancing voice in the book. You almost feel like getting up and saying, \\"hey! but you've got to look at this point of view as well\\"... For the sake of impact, Gladwell gets more assertive than the facts truly seem to support.<br />My recommendation - enjoy the book for the point it makes very well but don't necessarily start believing everything the author says.

The fact the disc will come with retranslated subtitles (Subtitles, not captions for the hard of hearing), three Dolby 5.1 audio soundtracks (Japanese, the English dub produced for the UK R2 DVD, and a new commissioned English dub) and Directors commentary makes this release ten times better than the pitiful Dreamworks release.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|this is a fantastic documentary. the commentry is perfect, the picture quality is unbelievable and there are some awe inspiring scenes in this. i love it.
B0015AARJI|1.0|It's a game controller. The design is a but cheaper and doesn't react very well with a few things, but all in all. It works.
0684857219|5.0|This is a great book for the average guy trying to build bigger muscles, it is actually a guide for people who want to get in the world of bodybuilding... but for the rest of us it is a great guide on how to adjust your current work outs or change your workout all together. It has a lot of info on health an nutrition among other things.It is packed full of info. I have not finished reading the book but I am about a 1/4 of the way through and am very satisfied with my purchase.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.Great storyline and delivers positive messages for children, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
B000002UTY|5.0|Happy Trails [[ASIN:B00004TKAQ Happy Trails]]is their first alblum. It's good if you like this kind of stuff(which I do).  There is some live parts. Who do you love on one whold side is divided into several different songs, but really not divided at all; there are spaces made afterwards so they can make more money because they were paid by the number of songs on the recording at that time.
B0017U7PT6|2.0|I guess it's a bad sign if while watching this film, all I could think about was what was wrong about it.  I'm not going to list all of them here, but a few really stick out: 1) the stupid accents for the dreadlocked Valley people, whatever their made-up names were, 2) the dreadlocks, 3) the obviously fake blue contact lenses that Camilla Belle had to wear - they couldn't find an actress with blue eyes if it's so central to the plot? 4) Duh'bleh's (lead) father leaves at the beginning of the film to \\"save his people,\\" but everyone thinks he's abandoned his tribe.  It's never explained what exactly he was doing aside from leaving and why he left - HUGE plot hole.  Makes absolutely no sense other than it sets up a total BS reason for the main characters to have a way to communicate with everyone else. 5) the story in general is absurd, but everyone knows that.<br /><br />What I did like was the special effects, especially the mammoths.  Mammoths are great.  I know these types of movies (on weird origins of civilization) are Emmerich's thing, but 10,000 BC is no Stargate.  It's no Day After Tomorrow either.  Worth a rent, but that's it.  Unless you really love mammoths.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I don't know of a singer today with a more magickal, ethereal voice than Loreena McKennitt, nor is there one who brings together so many different sources for her songs, from classic poetry to world myth, blending them into a glorious collage of sounds and words. And this collection of songs for the season is just that: a mix of many different songs for a multi-faceted holiday. There are original compositions like her own \\"Snow\\" and \\"Seeds of Love\\", which celebrate winter and anticipate the return of spring. There's traditional fare like \\"God Rest ye, Merry Gentlemen\\", but she makes it seem new by singing the verses you rarely hear. \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" brings us familiar lyrics reset to a new melody. \\"Bring a Torch, Jeanette\\" made me want to get up and dance. The rollicking a capella \\"Gloucestershire Wassail\\" sounds just the way a bunch of lusty wassailers should sound. And there's a few unusual songs that you rarely hear on other Christmas collections, such as \\"Coventry Carol\\", and the French \\"Noel Nouvelet\\". I think of all the new Christmas collections I've picked up this season, this is the most diverse and original, definitely one I'll be keeping in rotation from Christmas to Christmas, and maybe even picking it up when I need a little touch of the Christmas spirit.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|What is taking soo long!! I cannot believe that this was not priority #1 for the studio to release this before the holiday. A lot of money being lost - bad move studio, bad move!!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|As usual, Enya is wonderful.  It is a beautiful addition to my Christmas music. Worth the money.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|Good Collection.  Could have been more, but we all know that before they ever released it.  Kiss is Kiss.
0307455874|5.0|Ideology aside, this is an exceptionally well written book that can be enjoyed by readers on both sides of the political aisle.  Obama offers his views on a number of hot political issues, from education to technology to energy independence and so on.  He also offers a history of his ascent to the US Senate, and his experience once he was there.      It's a serious book that is peppered with heartwarming anecdotes from his family and personal experiences.  One such anecdotes occurs immediately after a vote on a nuclear non proliferation issue.  He calls his wife, Michelle, to share the good news about the outcome of the bill.  She is nonplussed by the affair and simply asks him to please pick up ant traps on his way home from work.  He pauses and reflects on whether Ted Kennedy or John Kerry ever had to buy ant traps on their way home from work.    All told, it's a very good read that can be enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.
B0001RVQM8|5.0|I heard the Fantasia Op 17 on the radio and thought it was Pollini, since I also have him performing this work.  When I learned it was Biss, I couldn't get over the maturity, the balanced phrasing, beautiful technique and just the right amount of romantic give and take.  There was nothing idiosyncratic about it like my Wilhelm Kemph CD (who is much better at Beethoven).  I was resolved to purchase it and have smitten my step-daughter and her husband with it, and am about to purchase a bunch of them for my own daughters and friends, as well as Biss' new Mozart CD with Orpheus.  We expect more great things from this young man.
B001NE80P4|5.0|Although the first HSM movie will always be the best because it was the first and started this whole phenomenon, HSM3 will by far be my favorite.  It started out as a low budget tv-movie all the way up to box office hit!  It had a modest budget of $11 million and made at least 8 or 9 times that amount.    It's fun to watch these movies because that is what it's meant for.  It's not meant to be really deep or profound--just fun!  You have to expect that from a G-rated Disney film.  That's what makes it great!    HSM3 has the best set designs, dance numbers, and coming of age drama that anyone can understand.  I high recommend this!
B0006L0LNY|1.0|If you Google search 'worst movie ever made,\\" Catwoman shows up on the very first page. Not even the likes of Halle Berry can save this train wreck. If you have some time on your hands and you want a good laugh, you might rent this one. Just don't waste your hard earned money on it!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|The best damned series on television. Madmen, a look inside Madison Avenue in the early 60's. Smoking, drinking and chasing secretaries -- and this is all happening during office hours. What more could a guy ask? Seriously, it is well written, well directed and the cast is great. If you haven't seen it, do so. You'll be hooked!
6305949980|5.0|Product was exactly as described. Arrived fast and like new with no scratches on the disc. Would recommend this seller and this item for anyone who loves The Nightmare before Christmas.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|I hate just about every Paul W.S. Anderson film, but he actually pulled this one off. The action scenes are intense, helped by the use of practical effects, rather than CGI overkill. Just wait until you see the tanker truck getting flipped in slow motion. Almost as cool as the semi truck flip in The Dark Knight. Jason Statham is the action star of this decade. The man has muscles everywhere and does the most with his limited acting range. Ian McShane of HBO's Deadwood is given some good lines and is one of the more memorable characters in the movie. I hope he gets more big screen parts in the future. Joan Allen turns in performance I could have never pictured her doing before today, and it worked.<br /><br />Death race will likely give you a headache with it's shaky camera movements and some of the dialogue could have used some work, but I had a great time. If your of the male gender, the cars, guns, explosions and babes will keep you entertained.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B000N2HCM4|4.0|Tbis book is the only book that shows the hardship and troble Obama went through to achieve a lifelong dream of his and I think that anyone who wants to understand where Obama is coming from should read this book
1402210086|4.0|Heyer does it again with this delightful tale of finding love when you least expect it.  Young Kitty Charing finds herself in quite a pickle when she learns what her eccentric guardian has in store for her.  The mean old goat has put a stipulation in his will that in order for her to inherit his fortune she must marry one of his great-nephews.  Say what?!  Well, that is just the most absurd thing she has ever heard and she means to take no part in it, except of course, to use it to her advantage.<br /><br />One of the old goat's great-nephews and prospective suitors, \\"fashionista\\" Freddy Standon, joins forces with Kitty to get her out of dodge, so to speak.  They fake a betrothal and persuade the eccentric to allow Kitty to stay with Freddy's family in London.  She has never been there and is dying to get out of the boring, old house she has been stuck in for years and meet people her own age.  What follows is a super cute story that will leave a smile on your face when you reach the end.<br /><br />Kitty is adorable and naive and sweet, but she isn't your typical flawless heroin - she has her faults like the rest of us and the fact that your never quite sure who Kitty is going to end up with was the best part for me.  If you're a fan of Heyers, Cottilion, will be up there with your favorites!<br /><br />Amy says:  4/5
B000ZBPQEO|5.0|I have listened to most of the CDs. The sound is excellent on almost all CDs, and very good on most others, although that is in part because I am not bothered by older mono recordings unless there is distracting noise. The performances are all very good, and many are outstanding.<br /><br />With some oversimplification, there are basically three periods of Karajan EMI recordings:<br />- post-war 1940s with the Vienna Philharmonic (WP)<br />- 1950s with EMI's own Philharmonia Orchestra (PO - before it broke with EMI much later)<br />- a few earlier recordings, but mainly 1970s to 1981 with the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO)<br /><br />There are a small number of recordings that don't fit into this scheme, like some Ravel pieces with the Paris Symphony Orchestra.<br /><br />Some of the highlights in terms of the contents:<br />- Karajan's first recorded Beethoven cycle, with the PO from the 1950s<br />- A complete set of Beethoven's piano concertos from the 1970s with Alexis Weissenberg and the BPO<br />- An excellent complete Schubert cycle from 1975-77 with the BPO<br />- All Sibelius symphonies except No. 3 -- there is quite a bit of overlap here between the PO and the BPO<br />- All Brahms symphonies (PO) except number 3<br />- A large array of Mozart works (Symphonies 29, 33, 35, 36, 39-41; horn concertos 1-4, Simphonia Concertante and many more)<br />- The historic Beethoven Triple Concerto with Oistrakh, Rostropovich and Richter<br />- Tchaikovsky's last three symphonies (two versions each)<br />- Dvorak's 8th and 9th (New World), plus Slavonic Dances<br />- Three Bruckner symphonies (4, 7 and 8), all BPO<br />- Haydn symphonies 83, 101 and 104<br />- Schumann symphony 4<br />- A good selection of overtures from Beethoven, Wagner, Rossini and others<br />- A large set of tone poems and other programmatic orchestral music (Richard Strauss -- sorry, no Zarathustra -- Sibelius, Debussy, Ravel, Bizet, Mussorgsky, Resphigi, Franck and others)<br />- Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf with Peter Ustinov narrating<br />- A smattering of \\"moderns\\", including Stravinsky's \\"Jeu de Cartes\\", Vaughan Williams' Tallis Fantasia, Britten, Hindemith's \\"Mathis der Maler\\"<br /><br />Of course this is an incomplete list, but I hope it gives an indication.<br /><br />If the set is underweighted in any type of music, it might be violin-focused works. Of the standard repertoire violin concertos, only Brahms is present. The Meditation from Thaïs is present as another violin showpiece<br /><br />The piano fairs better, with the Beethoven set, Tchaikovsky 1, Brahms 2, Rachmaninoff 2, Schumann, Grieg, and two Leimer concertos (including the very interesting concerto for the left hand).<br /><br />Overall, there is considerable \\"duplication\\" in terms of getting the same work multiple times with different orchestras. Most works are included only once, but many are included twice. The repetition gets more pronounced with three versions each of the following pieces:<br />- Mozart: Symphony 39, the clarinet concerto and \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\\"<br />- Sibelius: Symphony 5<br />- Tchaikovsky: Symphonies 4 and 6 (Pathetique)<br />- Strauss II: Several waltzes and polkas (4 versions of \\"Tritsch-Tratsch Polka\\" is probably the single most superfluous thing about the set)<br />- Chabrier: Espana Rhapsody (also 4 versions!)<br /><br />If you want to know more about individual recordings, here's a tip: do a search for \\"Karajan EMI\\" in the Amazon search engine. The reviews of EMI CDs conducted by Karajan will hopefully tell you all you need to know about the individual recordings. If it's ever been available by Karajan on EMI, it will either be in this set or in the companion set [[ASIN:B000ZBPQEE Karajan 100th - Volume 2, Opera and Vocals]].<br /><br />I bought this set at a time when I was starting to rebuild a classical CD collection after years of neglect and other interests. I would recommend it absolutely for anyone building their classical collection from scratchor almost scratch, although obviously if you have most of Karajan's best EMI recordings you might well not need this at all. If you don't have any Karajan EMI recordings -- I didn't -- this is a tremendous bargain and a big jump start to a nice collection of music.or almost scratch, although obviously if you have most of Karajan's best EMI recordings you might well not need this at all.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|If you don't mind a slow burn western, Appaloosa has much to admire. The acting by both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen is outstanding and the dialogue is believable for the most part. There is even some good humor thrown in, especially in the first half of the movie. While not as dark and gritty as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Ed Harris has created a western that never seems to be in a hurry. It has a nice relaxing feel to it, though the last half could have been trimmed up a bit. There isn't much action at all, and when there is, it is over in no time. Which is realistic (The real gunfight at the O.K. Corral was over in 30 seconds), but might not please the average person who paid $10.00 to see 3:10 to Yuma (2007 version) all over again.<br /><br />Appaloosa is often quiet, nicely acted, sometimes funny and well worth the time of any western fan.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Love this cd!! The 1st one I received had a fine scratch on it & wouldnt play right. Sent Amazon an email & they replaced it FAST!!! Very Very GOOD service!!! Thanks!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|its aweful, you wont enjoy this movie at all. I was attracted to this movie just because of its \\"good\\" poster.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm pretty much a Joss Whedon loyalist -- I loved \\"Buffy,\\" had trouble with \\"Angel\\" and drifted away for a season or two, but came back towards the end and enjoyed it as well... and I'm still mad at Fox for canceling \\"Firefly.\\" (Grrr... argh!)<br /><br />I heard about \\"Dr. Horrible\\" from somewhere or another, checked it out and watched it like a bazillion times in one night. It's not as elaborate or as brilliantly crafted as the fabled \\"Buffy, The Musical\\" episode, but kind of in the same ballpark. Neil Patrick Harris is a revelation: I sure hope he and Whedon are going to work on other stuff as well. Nathan Fillion clearly has so much fun working with Joss that he invariably lights up the screen as the obnoxious-jerk superhero, Captain Hammer. Clearly this low-budget mini-miniseries was a labor of love for all involved, and the results are fabtabulous -- you'd have to be born without any sense of humor at all not to enjoy \\"Dr. Horrible.\\" Jinkies, I wish there was a sequel! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B0000048CX|3.0|An older disc in a more traditional, subdued form, the album competently pays homage to the soft classics they cover and emulate, offering yet another angle for the band to mine in a diverse catalog. But overall, despite a lingering sweetness, FB remains ploddingly dull, moreover in the face of spacey textural advantages utilized on further albums.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|when i first found that there is a new batman movie coming out, i was excited. bt was very disappointed halfway throughout the movie. they hype abt ledger's performances. no offence to heath, but there's nothing great abt his performance. it was just good, not great. i dont think the movie would get so much hype if heath is still alive seriously. and christian bale, probably the worst batman of all. other than that, the movie is just too boring. too much talking, lack of action. still love the old batman with michael keaton and tim burton.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This is a great movie. The extended version really adds to the version I saw at the theatre. Christian Bale is the best Batman ever.
6302642248|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. She sings \\"When you wish upon a star\\" and \\"I got no strings on me\\". It's really cute. The movie I received was in great condition, arrived in good time AND YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!!   I love the internet!
B00004BZ0N|4.0|Innovative punk fusion at its finest, filled with minor transcendence, spectacular diversity, and renegade heart. Play this for solace when any overly-hyped UK buzz band hangs incessantly over your ears.
0802136834|5.0|This book was not only entertaining, but extremely educational as well. The author does an absolutely brilliant job of pulling the reader in and making one feel as though they personally know each character and are right there as the past unfolds. I highly recommend this book!
B000002UAR|5.0|What a great \\"rediscovery\\" for us who were too young to remember the Beatles during their reign. My husband and I recently visited the Beatles Museum in Liverpool and fell in love with them again. This is one of their best albums, and we never grow tired of listening to it!
B000AP04NI|5.0|This glorious Rogers and Hammerstein musical is set in turn-of-the-century Oklahoma, where cowboy Curly (Gordon MacRae) is in love with farm girl Laurey (Shirley Jones), and she thinks he's pretty special, too.  They tease each other but can't seem to speak their real feelings, which leaves Laurie going to the big box social with the odious ranch hand, Jud Fry (Rod Steiger).<br /><br />The movie is full of beautiful stars and songs with a wholesome, romantic story.  Gordon MacRae was a dreamy hunk o' man and he could sing great, too.  He definitely made the perfect singing cowboy hero.  Shirley Jones, making her movie debut at just 21, was the perfect fresh-faced innocent and what a voice!  She and MacRae had great chemistry.  Menacing Rod Steiger balances their idealism with his bitterness and even sings and dances.<br /><br />The songs have become familiar over the years because they're just so happy and easy to sing; \\"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,\\" \\"Surrey with the Fringe on Top,\\" and \\"People Will Say We're in Love\\" are gorgeous and \\"Oklahoma!\\" is bursting with pride and joy.  There are some beautifully-filmed ranch scenes, but also some outdoor scenes filmed on a soundstage that look stagey, and the ballet sequences go on a bit too long for my taste.  But those are small quibbles; it's a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.
B000002UVX|4.0|Thankfully Hendrix captured his brief stint with a more homegrown blues-rock pair in this 1970 New Year's  concert slice. It starts out a little unbalanced, which is to say that the first two songs seem to always dominate the mix, cutting through any fat, right to the purity of an unhinged solo. Despite that, the less jam oriented, though equally funky majority reveals a worthy vocalist in Miles and tight southern rock which unabashedly rocks to a demographic marketing restrictions would have excluded prior.
0385340990|5.0|Hands down my favorite book of 2008. The characters felt so alive and wonderful. The storyline is fresh. I loved everything about it, and my only disappointment was that it had to end.
B000002UAU|5.0|As one of the original \\"concept albums,\\" Sgt. Pepper's cannot be touched. It's creativity and musicality is amazing. If you like the Beatles even a little bit, this is the album to have in your collection!

078617286X|5.0|this is the best written history book I have ever read. Reasons to recommend it all general readers:    1. organized according to time instead of geography, and reflect the Themes of the time instead of only presenting \\"facts\\".     2. presented in a personal yet not too emotional fashion, feel just like an old wise friend telling stories, very engaging but still leave space for you to judge    3. balance of being concise and being vivid. select most influential events, yet still manage to add details to make historical figures alive
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie was fantastic, and on blu-ray all of it's splendor really comes out. Simply beautiful
B000002UB3|5.0|This is one of THE best albums ever produced. It's especially poignant when you know that the last cut, \\"The End,\\" is a \\"hint\\" to the real end coming for the group.
0920668364|3.0|Adults seem to love this book, it's very sentimental, but there are better children's books out there.  I would recommend this more for adults:  adult children moving out on their own, new parents, or maybe new grandparents.  There is little in this story about a mother watching her son grow up, move out and start a family of his own that a child can relate to.  In the end the son, who is now a father, says goodbye to his mother and takes on the role of the caring parent for his own child.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Well, I was going to avoid buying or even giving this album a listen. I saw it on sale at a local store for [...]  bucks and thought that wasn't too bad, and I picked it up. I am so glad I did. This doesn't even sound like the same band that did St. Anger! I'll admit, I like 1 or 2 tracks from St. Anger, but this entire album is great in my opinion. If you're looking for another Load or Reload, go elsewhere. This is probably as close to stuff like Kill 'Em All that these guys can touch at this time of their lives, but dammit is it good! I still listen to this entire album at least once a week. Not bad for someone who's taste is that of death metal.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Boy lives in \\"hell\\" with deadhead family and stifled dreams. Hope is in a place he doesn't suspect, one that's been there all his life.<br />After boy can't save his family, his new love (lifetime friend) makes a new start possible for both.<br />This is a nice movie, no sex involved, but implied. The characters are crazy enough to be in anyone's life.
B00005T7I1|2.0|DVD was great but service company was very slow getting it to me. Overall DVD worked very well, delivery just sucked.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|The video, audio. and overall quality of this release is superb all the way around! Their new virtual camera rig makes this movie seem almost documentary style in it's realism. It feels like it was actually filmed not made on computers and gives it an inviting organic feel. The fact there is no dialog for a very good portion of the film yet you always know what's going on is a testament to the amazing quality of animation and storytelling. The dusty earth feels desolate and run down while the space shots and pristine almost sterile white of the spaceship seem to glow with energy. if you have a TV capable of 1080p this is a must have! The completely digital transfer is immaculate in it's quality and holds up perfectly from frame to frame. A real show off of any Hi-Fi TV/ Surround sound setup!<br /><br />Besides all the usual extras found on other DVD's such as behind the scenes and so forth, this actually contains a FULL 90 min documentary all about the creation of Pixar, and thus the creation of computer animated movies. It's called The Pixar Story and If you are an animation junkie like me, love all the Pixar films, or simply want to know more about the history of arguably the best artist in animation today this film is a must see!
B0001Z53F6|5.0|I won't address the music itself in this review since more than enough has already been said about this phenomenal album.  My focus is on the 5.1 production of it.  Suffice to say, if there is a single album out there that has properly taken advantage of 5.1 technology, it is The Who's Tommy.  Pete Townshend produced this version himself and the results are clearly a labor of love.  While many DVD Audio discs give you width by separating tracks, this version combines them in a way that gives the listener remarkable *depth*, incredible sound that makes you feel like you are in the room with them.  I've compared this to a number of DVD Audio discs and it holds its own as a superior production second only perhaps to The Beatles' LOVE.  Highly recommended to Who fans and anyone who can appreciate the best of what surround sound offers.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|It was everything I was expecting. The DVD was absolutely terrific (me being a dedicated John Mayer fan), and the shipping was fast, arrived at my house in exactly 5 days .
0545128285|5.0|The _Tales of Beedle the Bard_  are short and moralistic, but as one would expect from Rowling, utterly fantastic. The short stories of _The Tales_ deal with themes familiar to any children's story: one emphasizing the importance of being generous and kind to one another, another story about the value of love, the final two lessons on dying and death: it will come for us all, there is nothing one can do to avoid it, so make the most of the time you have. Great lessons, all. But it was Rowlings unique way of telling the stories that so enraptured me.<br /><br />The stories are playful (Rowling, perhaps realizing the darkness of some of the themes makes a joke at those who wish to \\"sanitize\\" stories or make them over-sweet), yet have a serious tone to them. Following each story is a commentary by Dumbledore, with footnotes by Rowling to clarify points and provide explaination to references not made in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />While I am told the Collector's Edition is no longer in print, I do recommned the stories. Rowling is a master story-teller, as she once again demonstrates through these marvelous tales.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie shows that you should follow your passion, never give up, respect other's differences and do the right thing.  What more could you want?  The music is great, too.  Loved it and gave it to others for Christmas.
0930289234|5.0|This novel is nothing short of epic. You can't put it down. I will read it many many times.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This was a very engaging movie. I found myself falling for these characters from the onset. I was enthralled with their emotions and the depth that they portrayed them. I am also very aware that this was an animated film. Forget about that for a second. The two actually fell in love. That love went unrequited when duty and honor took over but in the end love prevailed. This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to all my friends and their children and grandparents alike. Four Stars
0956010903|5.0|The Collector's Edition of the _Tales of Beedle the Bard_ was an extravagance, admitedly.  I have never spent so much for a new book.  Yet I don't regret the decision.

0956010903|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful. Some people have remarked that their copy looks as if it were \\"made in China\\", but I don't see anything of the sort.  The metal work on the outside is beautiful and nothing flimsy.  When you open the little latch on the side of the book, you can feel it's weight.  The printing inside is really pretty.  The outside of the larger book is also beautiful.  I guess the only think I would want different about this Collector's copy of Beedle the Bard, is that the edges of the pages are too uniform and do not fit in with the rest of the style of the book. It would have been better if they had made the page edges uneven to make the book seem older and not factory - produced.<br /><br />It's really a beautiful book that I will want to keep for years to come.  Nothing cheap about it, in my view.  I think the price was OK if that money all goes to charity, which I hope is really the case.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />It's a beautiful book and I think the quality of workmanship to produce it is very good.

B0018CWEZ8|5.0|This continues the excellent enigmatic series of Lost and it's on blu ray.<br />The picture is fantastic and it's as good as the previous season 3 on blu ray.  It is only 14 episodes though. However for some reason the people in charge have decided to make the next two seasons only 17 episodes each. This one was only planned for 16 episodes which is short for a modern american series.  The price is high , just like bbc's excellent 'torchwood\\" on blu ray which is only 13 episodes long.  In truth the whole blu ray market needs to drop in price , when that happens we will see a flood of new blu ray buyers.  This series is great but due to it's shorter length the violence and destruction comes at a faster rate.  This is what happens when you shorten a series.  Characters start dying off left and right and you get less of a back story. I think the decision to shorten the next two seasons is a mistake , which leads to a more action packed show but it's less character driven and we don't get to know the newer characters much.  Still this is LOST , a totally inventive show that is engaging and extremely well written.  On blu ray it's brilliant to watch and the totally excellent acting of everyone involved is heads above most television series.  One thing that did shock me though was the ending in which a character returns( off camera) to the mainland to confront the survivors who escaped the Island and tells them 'bad things\\" happened after they left.  When in reality ever since they crashed on the island it was one death and disaster after another.<br />As good as this season was it was very fast moving and it removed many people from the island. Although on the island death is never the real end of the story.  A longer series length would mean more characterization between the carnage; but sadly they are not going that route for season 5 and 6.  It's worth buying this and season 3 on blu ray instead of watching them on standard dvd.  Let's hope they eventually put out season one and two on blu ray  as well.  Lost is a masterpiece of television series making and blu ray really makes this show stand out.one and two on blu ray  as well.   Lost is a masterpiece of television series making and blu ray really makes this show stand out.

B001GKJ2FC|3.0|This movie is aimed at action fans who don't really care about any realism. Those who want lots of computer animated effects,  Other movies escape from reality and have flying gunmen , cars that leap over cars , impossible acts that defy physics and a little character development as well so we are by now used to them.  The best of these are tongue in cheek movies like the transporter series and films like \\"shoot em up\\".  As a high budget A list movie this is shallow little action flick and that's ok.  But it is stuck in the hollywood rut that destroyed the premise of MANY hollywood movies:  The organization is evil and they are the bad guys.  In other words traitors or crooked leaders are the real monsters.  I can't remember the last movie I saw in which a team went after the bad guys and that was it.<br />This is along that bad organization vein, only it's over the top. And it's really aimed at that traditional young man fantasy in which a powerless young guy becomes a weapon of force.  You have to applaud the filmmakers though because in this movie they did NOT have (the always excellent) Angelina Jolie's character fall into bed with the now powerful main character. Which is a wise move and the ending is better than one would expect.  This is pure action on a video game level , it's good enough for having  two fun action filled  hours in spite of the usual hollywood twist: the real enemy is the organization that trains you.  The movies print of blu ray is great and it won't dissapoint blu ray fans in the that regard either.  Don't expect high drama here it's just a fun little ride that could have been better.

B001LRICM4|5.0|Supernatural is a PHENOMENAL show!! I own all the seasons and have been downloading this season's episodes until I can buy the dvd in '09. I can't think of one episode I was disappointed in. If you are interested in things \\"supernatural\\", this show will not let you down. Since they are in the 4th season, I recommend watching \\"In the beginning\\" first, it will at least bring you up to speed on the history of the Winchester boys. Can't wait for the rest of this season!!!
B001JOIEZ4|4.0|I saw the movie and then read the series. (Had to see what the hype was about...) It was slow to grab me, but I'm a fan now. The same was true of the soundtrack. I got it for \\"Flightless Bird\\" and eventually ALL the songs grew on me. BUT, I really wish I had NOT gotten it on Amazon. Even though it seemed cheaper to download the MP3s here, there were 3 bonus tracks missing that I would have really loved to have had. :(
B0002V7OI8|2.0|This movie had a few good actors in it but it wasn't enough to make up for the bad. TÃ©a Leoni is terrible as the news caster and her father in the movie was down right bad. Only watch it for the special effects because other wise, it is just plain bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I got a good laugh out of it. It wasn't very dramatic either! Put it this way, I was hoping a meteor would really hit the earth after seeing this

The characters - while they might be self centered and a bit selfish - are completely lovable, and the story was great. I loved the ending.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Big Bang Theory is one of my favorite sitcoms airing on TV today.<br />And unlike many sitcoms it was funny right from the very beginning.<br />This show follows the lives of roomates Sheldon and Leonard, their friend Raj and Wolfowitz and what happens when a super cute \\"regular\\" girl named Penny moves in next door. What I love about this show is that the characters are drawn from real life geeks.  I have attended around 25 Sci Fi conventions in my life and when viewing this show for the first time my immediate reaction was \\"I KNOW these people!\\"  But unlike other shows with geek stereotypes they are portrayed as funny, not pathetic.  There are a lot of embedded Sci Fi \\"in\\" jokes that make the show especially funny for those in the know. I also like that Penny is not a ditz. She isn't smart in the same way the guys are but she isn't stupid either.  And as the series progresses she starts fitting into their world and they into hers. The writing of this show is very well done and the performances by the actors are all top notch.  While I don't generally recommend purchasing sitcoms on DVD this one is worth every penny because<br />every time you watch an episode there is new stuff to discover. Big Bang Theory is currently in it's third season and I have yet to see a sub par episode.  Give this show a try.... you'll like it!
0060922583|5.0|This must be one of the most fascinating, if not the most fascinating book I have ever read, and it is a must-read for anyone who is even remotely curious about who and what we really are or who wants to see spirituality meeting science. The claims that are made are backed up by numerous scientific studies, but it doesn't blow you away with scientific jargon. It's written in an easy-to-read style and the different chapters are split up into subsections, which also helps. Michael Talbot explains what a hologram is and then goes on to argue that the holographic model can be used to explain multiple personality disorders (extraordinary! - if you know nothing about MPD, then you absolutely must read this section), psychokinesis, miracles, the human energy field (or energy bodies), past/present/future existing seemlessly together, near death experiences (NDEs), UFO sightings and much more.  Whether you accept the holographic theory or not, just reading the results of the various scientific studies mentioned in the book is fascinating and for me, personally, as a poet and author, it was also inspiring. The idea that everything is interconnected in this holographic universe of ours and is part of the same continuum inspired me, for example, to write a poem called 'My Life' to try and make sense of it ('...all that I see and don't see, hear and don't hear, touch and don't touch, smell and don't smell, taste and don't taste I am - I am the eternal energy of everything...'), whilst the story of the woman in the NDE chapter who said that 'she hadn't danced enough yet', making the being of light she was talking to laugh heartily and enabling her to return to physical life, gave me an idea for a children's story. In short, I found the book riveting and inspirational - jam-packed full of extraordinary scientific fact way more mind-blowing and thrilling than any science fiction I've ever read - and I am now reading it for a second time and will probably read it a third and fourth time as well!time as well!

B001F2W4Y2|5.0|This is hands down their best album in 28 years!   Those looking for innovative and sophisticated AC/DC have totally missed the point. Angus and his crew will kick you in the teeth with this record. The quality of the songs is unrivaled-this is the greatest rock'n roll album in years. It ranks up there with the albums of the Bon Scott period. I can't point out any songs because all of them are amazing.  I had almost given up on them after they had slacked off in the Nineties. But hey man that was just the quiet before the storm!
0783227434|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Campy beyond belief (and intentionally so), Army of Darkness is not a particularly good movie and the weakest of its trilogy, but worth a look if you're in the mood for some schlocky comedy delivered by camp-master Bruce Campbell.

B00003CWN3|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A beautifully-acted and touching story, Boys Don't Cry takes a non-Hollywood approach to this story from Middle America and is all the better for it; certainly not for everyone, the movie is nonetheless heartily recommended to people who are sick of glossy formula and ache for stories.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|For the one star reviews, and those that said it's not for real Beatles fans, I must say, \\"Huh?\\"  If you know anything more about the Beatles than their music, for instance, what their views were on global politics in the 60's, then I'd say this really does hit the mark.  I couldn't help thinking that if Lennon were alive to see this, he would be happy that they \\"got the message\\".<br /><br />This story is a series of vignettes of the times, as portrayed through the music of the Beatles.  And though no, the arrangements are not exactly those of the Beatles's recordings, as they were in the BeeGees's Sgt. Pepper's, they illustrate just how transcendent their music is - It stands up to good arranging and interpretation.  The voices and performances are great here.  I got goose bumps over some of the arrangements.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because it IS flawed - and the quality of the audio leaves something to be desired.  I was skeptical because of what I've read here, but I was blown away by it.  It's worth a watch for sure, and you may be surprised.

0374530718|5.0|The Norwegian girl Sophie Amundsen is about to celebrate her fourteenth birthday when she receives through the mail a strange message from a certain Albert Knox. What starts out as a few pieces of paper turns into a full course in philosophy. Although Sophie is enthralled by that mysterious course, she keeps pondering on who that strange Albert Knox might actually be. But that is not the only mystery: Sophie receives post cards addressed to a girl named Hilde. As Sophie receives more messages from Albert, she learns even more that the basics of philosophy.<br /><br />Although Sophie's World was originally written as an introduction to philosophy for the youngsters, it is also a veritable treat for people who have already passed that stage. Even more, I guess that this is one of the most readable introductions you can find to that wonderfully and interesting world of philosophy. It takes you on a voyage from Socrates to Kant and from Darwin to Freud. It covers the many different perspectives on the world that have been known to influence history. As such it shows nicely how every idea breeds new ideas. The power of the book is that it takes its time to explain every concept and illustrate them with comprehensive examples. The storyline of Sophie guides you through the chapters and adds some mystery value to it. Due to its broad scope it will be a book that you will keep rereading with much joy.

B000957O7S|5.0|Hitch is a 2005 romantic comedy film starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James and Amber Valletta. The film is directed by Andy Tennant and written by Kevin Bisch. Smith plays a professional matchmaker, who makes a living teaching men how to woo women. The film was released on February 11, 2005 by Columbia Pictures.<br /><br />Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Will Smith) is a professional \\"date doctor\\", or consultant as Hitch terms himself, who coaches other men in the art of having the perfect date with the woman of their dreams.<br /><br />While coaching one of his clients, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), who is smitten with celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), Hitch finds himself falling for Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist who is determined to unmask and ruin the so-called date doctor after one of his \\"clients\\" (with whom Hitch refused to work) had a one-night stand with her best friend. However, where Albert and Allegra's relationship continues to progress, Hitch finds that none of his tried and tested methods are working on himself, despite being a master of the art. After Hitch is unmasked, he and Sara break up, and Allegra and Albert follow suit. Finally, Hitch confronts Allegra and convinces her to reunite with Albert, before reconciling with Sara. In the process, he makes the startling discovery that he doesn't really do anything significant, and that most of his customers (particularly Albert) really were successful by just being themselves. In the end, Albert and Allegra get married and celebrate their marriage with Hitch and Sara,who are also back together again. Hitch, reflecting on love's unpredictability, addresses the audience in the last line, \\"Basic principles... There are none.\\"<br /><br />The production budget was $70,000,000. Smith alleged that actress Eva Mendes, of Cuban descent, was offered the female lead because the producers were worried about the public's reaction if the part was played by a White actress (creating a potential interracial taboo) or a Black actress (creating a studio fear that two black leads would alienate the white audiences). It was believed that a Latina and a Black lead would sidestep the issue.[2] Robinne Lee's character (Cressida) was originally offered to Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai, but she could not take the role due to scheduling problems.[3] The working title of the movie was The Last First Kiss, referring to a line that Hitch delivers to Albert: \\"This could be her last first kiss.\\" Parts of the movie were filmed in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, at Columbia University.<br /><br />Will Smith as Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens<br />Eva Mendes as Sara Melas<br />Kevin James as Albert Brennaman<br />Amber Valletta as Allegra Cole<br />Julie Ann Emery as Casey Sedgewick<br />Adam Arkin as Max<br />Robinne Lee as Cressida Baylor<br />Nathan Lee Graham as Geoff<br />Michael Rapaport as Ben<br />Jeffrey Donovan as Vance Munson<br />Paula Patton as Mandy<br /><br />The film received mixed to generally positive reviews, garnering a 68% \\"fresh\\" approval rating from notable critics, a 61% approval rating from top critics, and a 73% approval rating from users on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

0375826726|4.0|Well much like other reviews, I do enjoy the series, is GOOD. Is not a masterpiece, is a FANTANSY world people, the point is get lost in it, and forget errors and some minor flaws. Sure the long period lost in the politics was boring, but if the author though it was necessary, then just pretend you care and more on the story-All in all though, the book is good, and it is great for kids, get them to not be afraid of BIG BAD BOOKS!
B00003CXDD|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Now that Willow's special effects (its major selling point at the time, are dated and fairly unimpressive, the movie is really not worth watching; Val Kilmer is fun enough but the story is really pretty derivative.

B00133KFGW|5.0|Freddie Highmore is wonderful as August Rush.  I can tell that the producers of this movie are huge fans of the movie Show Boat, particularly the 1936 version starring Irene Dunne.  The 1936 version departs from the book and other versions of the movie and the play, but it is considered the classic version of Show Boat.  I am a classic movie lover myself, and this movie is part of my video collection.  The relationship between the couples in both movies share common elements.  The naive, sheltered girl falls for the guy from the opposite side of the track.  Both have a talent for the stage.  She has an overbearing, overprotective parent.  The couple separate.  Years pass.  The child follows in the parents' footsteps.  The couple reunite in the audience on their child's big night on stage.  The movies even end the same way in the final scene.  The music in both is top notch.  There are other similarities, but there are also differences.  The big difference is that the child in Show Boat is always with the mother, but the child here is an orphan, and this movie centers around his efforts to find and reunite with his parents.  I enjoyed this fresh update.

Listen to it, in its entirety, all in one sitting, at least once.  Replay it over and over again.  Believe me, it grows on you.  Although I originally bought the cd for the most popular song, \\"Viva la Vida,\\" it is now one of my favorite cds and \\"Viva la Vida\\" isn't even my favorite song on the cd.  It's different, you have to be prepared for that, but it's worth taking a second (or third or fourth) look.

B001795SH8|5.0|Claudio Abbado recorded a complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic in 2000 in Berlin. For all its fast tempi and crisp articulation, much of it struck me as rather grey and dispassionate. There were some good points - fine accounts of symphonies 1, 2, 4 and 9 in particular - but overall it was disappointing. This 'new' set was mostly recorded just one year later, taken from live performances in Rome, but with the earlier Berlin account of the ninth retained.     Abbado's interpretations seem to have evolved rather a lot in such a short space of time. Tempi are still brisk, but Abbado now gives the music room to breath. In the sleeve notes, the conductor talks about developing more of a shared view with his orchestra. That's readily apparent in the performances. Where before we had an orchestra playing all the notes very proficiently, now there's much more of a sense of an ensemble making music together.     What distinguishes this set from almost every other complete cycle is its remarkable consistency. There isn't a single disappointment amongst the nine. The style is very much in keeping with the current mainstream - played on modern instruments but with transparent textures and lively tempi. Abbado reveals details without expressive point-making, and allows the music to unfold naturally.    There are, of course, many great accounts of individual symphonies by other artists. But if you are looking for a complete cycle by one orchestra and conductor, Abbado's has to be one of the top recommendations. For me, first choice is between this set and Osmo Vänskä's recently completed cycle. Vänskä's is perhaps the more thought-provoking of the two, and it is better recorded, while Abbado's sounds more spontaneous and is conveniently and economically packaged (Vänskä's currently being available only on five separate CDs). If your budget permits, buy both.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|If you liked the movie, you will enjoy this Blu-ray disc! The quality of the sound and picture is very good and the extras add to the enjoyment of the movie.     In addition to the movie, there are quite a few extras to peruse! The focus points are probably the best of the extras, but the other clips (like the Gotham Tonight episodes) also add to the enjoyment of the movie experience.     The BD-Live features that Warner Bros. have created for their first effort bodes well for future Blu-ray releases from the studio. I'm sure that the surface of what's possible has just been scratched, and it stands as a great example of why BD-Live capability is a must-have when buying a Blu-ray player.    The quality of the movie and the extras, along with the BD-Live functionality, make this a sure bet for purchasing as opposed to simply renting it.
B001F7MSG6|4.0|Hellboy 2 is a very entertaining movie. The detail on BR is fantastic. Make sure your Blue Ray player has the latest software revision or this disk may not play.
B00005JPUN|3.0|It is always brave to make a remake of a classic movie, even more so when there have already been a few. I did see the original 'cult' version which was excellent taking the technology at the time into account and the low budget not the least.<br /><br />But lets be for real. A lot of younger (and older) people never saw that and for some they do need a couple of known actors in it to even consider a movie and for them this version was not bad at all I think. It was not a monumental movie at all but it did what it tried out to do - entertain while raising an important question about the consequences of the human conscience as we know it.<br /><br />Was it great and memorable? maybe not but was it meant to be?
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Wow! What a great CD! However, a few songs on here are a little iffy (definitely not for kids younger than their teens). At first, I was disappointed in the CD, but after listening to the CD a few times, I began to LOVE it! You kinda have to warm up to it... I was expecting more \\"soft rock\\" (like Photograph and Faraway) but I was pleasantly surprised. My favorites are Gotta Be Somebody, Never Gonna Be Alone (a GREAT wedding song), and I'd Come for you. Nickelback is definitely at it again. If you are a fan of their music, you should definitely buy this CD.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Third is the third (hey!) album by Portishead, one of the 90s' top trip hop bands, although from what I can tell it's not very close to what that sounds like. I don't have to be familiar with their earlier work though to know that this is one of the bleakest and most gripping albums I've heard in a while. It's one of those things you really have to listen to with headphones.    The overall sound is a sort of a downbeat industrial/electronic thing with a healthy mix of normal guitar and percussion added. Any remnants of hip hop scratching or whatever aren't there. The songs flow perfectly, with the instrumentation sparse when it needs to be and booming where required. It's another record that nails the balance of a cohesive tone while varying the sound enough to keep the songs unique and interesting. \\"Silence\\" has a quick drum beat and some dissonant feedback to play with the electronic sounds. In \\"Hunter\\", they go back and forth between the chirps and a more normal, slow guitar and drum thing. \\"The Rip\\" starts in with a plucking acoustic melody and eventually brings in quicker drums with an infectious electronic element. \\"Plastic\\" has the most obvious trip hop sound to it, I think. \\"We Carry On\\", as Pitchfork aptly mentioned, sounds a lot like a Clinic song, with its constant and off-putting beat. \\"Small\\"'s another track that bounces back and forth between styles. \\"Magic Doors\\" manages to work a piano in there along with some horns. The closer, \\"Threads\\", might be the most aggressive, with a nefarious twinge to it, and ends with a minute of a very angry sounding machine sound.    I've been ignoring one of the most important elements though, which is the vocal work by Beth Gibbons. Her voice is mournful and haunting, and fits perfectly with every track, and she sings the depressing lyrics in a very evocative, affecting way. Just look at two back to back songs, \\"Deep Water\\" and \\"Machine Gun\\", completely different musical styles, one a simple, acoustic, folksy number,the other pure minimalistic industrial with a few synth chords added in, both improved greatly by her singing. Third isn't exactly the most wonderful thing to listen to, but for what it's trying to do, it's one of the best constructed and executed works I've heard.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|I wish this movie was longer, it goes fast with all the action. The storyline is somewhat predictable but has great action and intensity. The blu-ray quality video and audio is exceptional. Good LFE and surrounds are used throughout. The making of extra is in HD as well.
0316017922|4.0|I'm hard pressed to think of an author better than Malcolm Gladwell at exploring an issue that seems familiar and obvious, but finds a way to express the issue in a new way. In Outliers, Gladwell challenges the notion of meritocracy by showing how no one ever succeeds on his or her own. Chance, luck and seizing opportunities are key to success: there's no substitute for being in the right place at the right time. On the other hand, individuals with high potential are unlikely to succeed if they are not given opportunities to use that potential. Another great insight in Outliers involves the importance of practice. Gladwell proposes that 10,000 hours of practice makes all the difference. Highly recommended.
B001I9O9L8|5.0|I hadn't seen this on sd dvd but I enjoyed the content. I became interested in Sting a little later than when this was made so I learned a lot about Sting. The video quality is poor. Although the colors are good there is a lot of grain, some dirt and white sparkles throughout. I know this was made years ago so that may account for it. I don't know how it compares to the sd dvd. The audio is lacking LFE and bass. It isn't obvious the surrounds are used, I had to stand by the speaker to check. Since I don't have the sd and I was able to get this for less than the cost of the sd, I'm glad I bought it. You might want to give it a rent before buying to check it out for yourself.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for adults, too. Top-notch animation, a sweet story and a message about what's really important. Proves you don't need a lot of words to tug at the heartstrings!
B001L4NJIO|5.0|Not only is the content amazing but the audio and video quality far surpass most blu-ray releases of concerts or movies to date. If you like The Police you will love this disc. I don't have anything negative to say about this disc, I just wish it was longer.
B0006J28L4|5.0|I say this quite often about movies, but very rarely say it with as much conviction as when I'm referring to Malcolm X. This is, without a doubt the best movie I've seen in my entire lifetime, and if you haven't seen it, then it will become the best movie you will ever see. I'm actually shocked by some of the 1 star reviews, especially the one calling it a dangerous movie. For one, this movie keeps very loyal to the events and people talked about in his autobiography written by Alex Haley. To call it a dangerous film because it chronicles the life of Malcolm X, would be to call history dangerous. It accurately documents the rise and fall of Malcolm X and accurately displays the reasons for that rise and fall. If a man converted to Islam and became a militant because of this movie, then simply, he didn't get this movie, or at least he didn't watch it all the way through. This isn't anti-Islamic, nor can it be claimed that this in any way can incite militant or extremist behaviour as this exposes the consequences of such behaviours.<br /><br />Malcolm X was a man who possibly equally responsible for the civil rights movement of African-Americans, yet accomplished it in a completely different way. When I first read \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\" by Alex Haley some 5 years ago, it changed my life. The story of the mans religious beliefs and strong heart was inspiring and a story that showed you can really achieve anything if you set your mind to it. Of course, it's clich&eacute; but life is full of clich&eacute;s and that one is about the only clich&eacute; you can associate with Malcolm X. He was a man not afraid to speak the truth about the segregation of Afro-Americans, especially in the North where it was believed the black man was much more equal than in the south. Spike Lee in some ways is a lot like Malcolm X, he's a man not afraid to speak out against lifes atrocities and lies by putting them up on screen.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is possibly the best casting choice for a movie I've ever witnessed and this casting. Not only does he look like Malcolm, but his personality and charisma match that of the legendary figure. The start of this film is Malcolm (Denzel) delivering one of his infamous speeches which sends the electricity down your spine. What's special is even the delivery is akin to that of Malcolm. After that speech we're reverted back to Malcolms beginnings in Harlem as a drug pusher and pimp, and he's telling the story of his early childhood which presents us with numerous flashbacks of his Fathers murder and his Mothers descension into insanity. Because of this, you sort of become aware of how he ends up being the man he is at the start of the movie by going through all these tragedies. After a robbery with his best friend Shorty goes wrong, he's sent to jail where he finds the Nation of Islam and is visited by an apparition of the Prophet Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm has his eyes opened by the atrocious treatment of the African American by the white man. The NOI even today are fighting to have a state designated solely for the Black American, where they can govern themselves and look after their own interests. Malcolm eventually becomes a minister for the Nation and opens it up to a much wider audience, much to the displeasure or the Nation of Islam.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Minister Malcolm, then you're familiar with what happens next as a result of his joining the Nation. The spectacular life events of such a man are just un-imaginable and it's hard to believe that a man, although he'll disagree, when he was a member of the Nation of Islam was such a segregationist managed to be an influence on so many people. Making such high profile friends such as film star Ossie Davis and working with other, more integarationist activists like Martin Luther King, he managed to truly change the world and is probably one of the main reasons as to why America now has a black man in the White House. Depending on how you look at it, you can either determine that the Islam religion was what made Malcolm such a hero, or whether it was the original manipulation of the Nation of Islam. Either way, I think all will agree that the man was taken away from us all too early.<br /><br />Looking at articles about Malcolm and his wife Betty X, I found out something truly heart wrenching. Betty X, Malcolms wife, died just over 10 years ago in a fire caused by Malcolm X's grandson. I'm not sure whether the fire was lit to deliberately kill his grandmother, but he was arrested and sentenced to 18 months in Juvenile detention for manslaughter. The reason I brought this up is in the film you will be shown a lot of Betty X and you will come to realise when a great mother and wife she was. She was just as strong an influence on the life and times of Malcolm, as the blight of the black American was. She held the Shabazz family together through the times they left the Nation of Islam and were basically being tortured by them. I applaud her and minister Malcolm for their effect on the world and equal rights.<br /><br />Minister Malcolm X (El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz) May 19 1925 - February 21 1965<br /><br />Dr. Betty Shabazz May 28 1936 - June 23 1997<br /><br />May they both Rest in Peace.mine that the Islam religion was what made Malcolm such a hero, or whether it was the original manipulation of the Nation of Islam.

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|\\"Mamma Mia!\\" brings the wildly successful ABBA-inspired stage musical to the screen with a cast of actors who don't usually sing or dance. The film retains the behind-the-scenes talent from the stage show: director Phydilla Lloyd, producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and score by former ABBA member Benny Andersson. It adds one song and leaves a few others out, but this is very much a transfer of the stage musical to the screen. A young woman named Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) plans to marry her beau Sky (Dominic Cooper) and dreams that her father will be at her wedding to give her away. But Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Twenty years ago, her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) had summer flings with three men. Sophie invites all three to her wedding in Greece in hopes that she will recognize her father. But when Donna sees the men from her past, she's sure that they will ruin the wedding.<br /><br />There's hardly any point in mentioning that the set-up for this musical romp in the Greek Isles is silly beyond words. But the three candidates for Sophie's paternity are appealing guys, and the actors are game: American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish adventurer and travel writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard). The men are counterbalanced by a trio of sprightly middle-aged ladies: Donna and her friends Rosie the author (Julie Walters) and Tanya the serial divorcee (Christine Barnasky). These are fun characters, and I enjoyed them. I wish I could say the same for the younger set. Amanda Seyfried has a nice enough voice, but Sophie is annoying and seems more like a 13-year-old than a woman of 20.<br /><br />The musical numbers are dull. I partly blame the lack of vigor on the locations. This is a jukebox musical, so the songs are not integrated into the plot as seamlessly as they would be if the music had been written for the stage. And since this is a movie, filmed on location in Greece, they don't have the benefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage. In these wide open locations, further muted by transfer to the screen, the musical numbers fall flat. I kept hoping that the next scene would not be musical, because the stuff in between was reasonably charming. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most of the principle cast is over 50. Generally an appealing cast, even if they are not the best-suited talent for a musical, but unfortunately, the music that's supposed to be the selling point is the film's weakness.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has the option of viewing a Sing-a-Long version in which the lyrics to the songs are displayed across the screen during musical numbers. There is one deleted musical number called \\"The Name of the Game\\" (3 min). And there is a feature commentary by director Phyllida Lloyd. She talks about locations, some photographic techniques, characters, cast, filming, her approach to the musical numbers, and various technical details. Subtitles are available in English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.enefit of an intimate venue. On stage in a small venue, energy would be flying off the stage.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|There are many people that would gladly shut down this film saying it's surrounded by unjust hype simply because it's the last role of Heath Ledger. I have to say that a statement such as this couldn't be anymore false. Sure, the hype was bigger due to the untimely death of Ledger. But it was a movie and a role (Joker) that delivered on all levels. Batman Begins introduced us to the troubled man that is Bruce Wayne and told the story of how he becomes The Batman. Batman Begins, although very well put together and the story being told brilliantly; I found that at times it had moments when it would drag. The Dark Knight repairs those problems and gives us a movie of equal length, that manages to hold my attention throughout. My review will be split into three sections. The story, the characters and the verdict. This is to give you, the reader a fair and open opinion of the movie for which you can place your own opinion.<br /><br />The Story: A year after the chaos caused by Ra's Al Ghul, the Batman has become a symbol in Gotham for all citizens. It's a symbol to show that nobody needs to be afraid when confronted with the criminal underworld of Gotham. This is a problem for Batman as it's created a lot of copy cat vigilantes. Unfortunately, the copy cat attempts don't go as well as the Batmans attempts do. Batman has inspired even the law to fight against the mob underworld as the new District Attorney in town, Harvey Dent is determined to put the mob behind bars. The fight will be even harder than first thought as a man known only as the Joker, isn't interested in financial gain. He's just interested in creating chaos and he breeds a new class of criminal.<br /><br />The Characters: I'm not going to talk about the Batman character, as simply it's not the most interesting character in this film. Surprisingly. I am, however, going to talk about the \\"supporting\\" cast in this movie.<br /><br />The Joker (Heath Ledger): This is easily the most intimidating villain in movie history. Even more so than Hannibal Lecter portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. The voice, the look and the body language are all done superbly by Ledger. They blend together brilliantly in order to create a very believable psychopath. The back story of the Joker isn't touched in this film, as in the comic universe it's never been confirmed 100% of how the Joker came about. The Joker, in order to achieve his goal of killing the Batman he must employ the help of the mob. He doesn't have the money but he has the skill of intimidation and the callousness the frighten, even the mob into working for him.<br /><br />Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart): I have to admit, I've never been a fan of Eckhart as most of his movies preceding Dark Knight have been mediocre at best. He wins my vote in his role as Harvey Dent; the fearless District Attorney who, thanks to the work by Batman is willing to put his life on the line to put the mob behind bars. His transformation from respected DA into the broken \\"Two-Face\\" is inspiring and really seals him as a legitimate actor and a legitimate role.<br /><br />Gordon (Gary Oldman): Oldman plays a much bigger role as Gordon in this movie. He's someone who becomes more involved in shaping the Batman character from hero to vigilante. It's a much more likable role this time around and has bigger impact when confronted with the Harvey Dent alter-ego \\"Two-Face\\"<br /><br />The Verdict: I honestly love this film. Unlike the first installment, this never stops. From the opening we're treated to a great bank robbery that gives us the genius and craziness of Joker. This has its truly heart wrenching moments, but I'm not going to mention them as they give away the plot. I was a little disappointed by the very small and quite frankly, pointless cameo of Scarecrow. Although a beaten shell of a man I would have liked to see him have a darker and more prominent role once again in this picture. Apart from that it's a non-stop genius picture and something that livesup to the hype. The role of Ledger lives up to the bill and is something that could win Heath his first and only Oscar. This makes it more unfortunate that we no longer have Ledger with us to feel the glory created by his Joker.he bill and is something that could win Heath his first and only Oscar. This makes it more unfortunate that we no longer have Ledger with us to feel the glory created by his Joker.

B0008ENICU|5.0|While the story line may not have been to my taste, the acting in this movie is wonderful. The women are all interesting and well cast. The movie held my attention from beginning to end. I've seen it on TV a couple of times over the years and I'm sure will watch it again.     The one thing that always confuses me is if Norma Shearer's character was so wonderful, why did her husband stray? If he was that weak, why did she want him back? Maybe things like this just happen and there isn't always a logical explanation, but it wasn't realistic to me. Once he left her, she should have gone and never looked back.    The more I see some of these older movies, the more I love them mostly because they were so well directed and acted. What some of these movies show is that a movie can have adult themes without being completely vulgar and juvenile. I may not always appreciate every nuance but in comparison to movies today, there is some magic there.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I first heard her song Hometown Glory on Lufthansa Airlines in route to Frankfurt and fell in love with her unique voice.  I purchased the album upon returning to the states and was thrilled to discover all the songs are just as good as the one I heard in flight!  Great Album!

B0017IYWEE|5.0|This is one of the best opera CDs to be released in the last decade and definitely on of my Top 10 CDs for the last year. She already has recorded the best Queen of the Night since Edda Moser 30 years ago. Now she has recorded one of the best CDs of Mozart arias ever. If she isn't already considered a superstar, then she is well on her way to becoming one. This is a voice that is even from top to bottom, dramatic without pushing, and lyrical, yet with some bite when needed. If you buy one Mozart CD, this should be it.

0375826726|2.0|Paolini led us all to believe that this would be a trilogy and then pulled a bait-and-switch on Volume 3 because \\"it soon became obvious that the remainder of the story was far too big to fit in one volume\\" (to quote Chris directly).  Although I felt like it was a marketing ploy, I was willing to cut the young man some slack.  After reading the book, it became clear that it *was* a marketing ploy.      As some other reviewers have made clear, this book is full of a lot of padding.  Chris has to recognize that he's not writing the Great American Novel - we want a compact story with some character development and lots of plot movement.  I read chapter after chapter that made no plot progress.  He could easily have compressed the entire book into 25% its current length with little sacrificed.   If he hadn't promised a trilogy, I might have given it three stars.      I won't buy the fourth, but I'll check it out from the library.

The drawings are fantastic, of course her stories are just wonderful, and I would think this will become a hard to find book. It is as much a pleasure for adults (maybe even more so), as it is for children. It is in a very nice hard slipcase for protection. Frankly, this is a treasure that I will keep forever and enjoy throughout the years!  Worth every cent, even though a little more costly than most children's books. It's hard to put a real value on a collection like this!

I read this for the first time in high school.  I have reread it numerous times throughout my life. I am reading it again recently at 37. It keeps revealing depths that I wasn't ready for at earlier times. This book has become part of my consciousness, who I am.

B001G7SS9G|4.0|Richard Matheson's novel \\"I Am Legend\\" has been made into at least three motion pictures -- \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" (Vincent Price), \\"The Omega Man\\" (Charlton Heston), and \\"I Am Legend\\" (Will Smith) -- and has served as inspiration for dozens of others.  The story combines science fiction and horror in a bleak, pessimistic view of the future of mankind.<br /><br />In the latest version, \\"I Am Legend,\\" Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who was unable to halt the spread of an incurable, man-made virus.  Immune to the fatal virus, Neville is the sole human survivor in what remains of New York City and possibly the world.  His only companion is his dog, Samantha.  But mutant plague victims -- the Infected -- lurk in the darkness, watching Neville's every move and waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.  Day to day, Neville is driven by a single mission:  to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.  To do so, he must use his own immune blood.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is by far the most ambitious of the three screen adaptations of Matheson's novel.  The opening scenes, showing a deserted Times Square overgrown with vegetation, are spectacular, and Smith manages to keep the story flowing in the early scenes even though he's the only person we see.  Flashbacks illustrate the stages leading up to the present near-obliteration of humanity and are elaborately staged by director Francis Lawrence.  The film's third act resorts to a fairly routine formula of the hero versus the monsters but, overall, \\"I Am Legend\\" is an impressive effort.<br /><br />The \\"I Am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is just the thing for sci-fi and Will Smith fans.  The three-disc box set contains two versions of the movie, one with a controversial ending; a digital copy of the film; four animated comics; 12 never-before-seen deleted scenes along with filmmaker's commentary; a 44-page concept sketch book; a lucite commemorative piece featuring images from the movie; and hours of featurettes covering filming on the aircraft carrier Intrepid, canine training, making New York City look deserted, assistance provided by the U.S. Military, and the integration of CGI images with live action footage.

And the other two tracks are great too, not just \\"hey we got another side to fill, now what\\", but legitimately wonderful music too.  Of course, I can't make head or tail of the lyrics.  I rather listen to this with the voice more as an instrument, since I can't understand him and if I could I'd just be confused.  It's about the music.

B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie provides great sociological insight into 1950s liberal New York's sexual mores.  It also features suicide attempts by the two protagonists.  Shirley MacLaine's character takes an overdose of sleeping pills; Jack Lemmon's character admits he tried to shoot himself as a younger man.    The suicide theme plays through to the very end, when MacLaine hears the \\"pop\\" of a champagne cork and thinks Lemmon has shot himself again.    The movie is mostly about sexual mores, however.      At the office Christmas party you see all sorts of couples making out (presumably they're not married couples), and one of the company's telephone operators does a great mock striptease with a long strand of pearls.      The one time that the Jack Lemmon character \\"scores,\\" it's with a married woman whose husband is away in Cuba.  They're both drunk on Christmas Eve and she's looking for some action.      Many of the female characters are chippies who get picked up by older married businessmen.  Fred MacMurray, of the wholesome \\"My Three Sons\\" fame, is a total slimeball in this picture.      The movie won a number of Oscars.  I thought it was adapted from a Broadway play, but it wasn't.      It was the last black-and-white film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, until Schindler's List (1993), Steven Spielberg's feel-good Holocaust flick.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I'm surprised at the negative reviews on this film; there must be a lot of curmudgeons out there.  First of all, most people who went to see Mamma Mia love ABBA and all their songs.  Obviously no one can sing these songs even half as well as ABBA did, but so what?  Bjorn and Benny's music is so wonderful it stands on its own no matter who sings it.  This film is fun, the gorgeous Greek setting makes it pure eye candy, the songs no matter how \\"imperfectly\\" they were sung are still infectious and make you want to jump out of your seat and dance, and you will sing along with most of them.  This movie does exceedingly well what it is supposed to do:  entertain.   As for the ABBA music, I probably wouldn't buy this soundtrack and rather, I would buy the original ABBA music if I wanted a CD of the songs on this film.
1400063515|3.0|I am a new convert to these types of concepts.  Intelligence and intellect after reading scores of badly written novels for me is a refreshing change -- daunting my previously hum-drum reading habits.  So far, I find myself reading and then re-reading paragraphs - and then my head spins around, suddenly realizing that for so many years I didn't know much.  I appreciate the genisus, I am pleased to see that after reading Freakanomics, I have found a new world of thinking.  The Black Swan has some non-answers to my many questions, but perhaps that's a good thing!
0066620996|1.0|Please google critical review of G2G before reading. There are major problems with the \\"research\\" presented. Check out Nassim Nicholas Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" for some insight into what really makes a company great. The answer; no one really knows. It's all random.     Business books are nothing but fads and fashion. Read, borrow a couple of ideas, then throw them in the trash when you are done. G2G became required reading where I work and in my view has nearly destroyed the company. It was, and still is, considered the Gospel of business. Prior to G2G we grew from zero to $120M in 10 years. In the 7 years after G2G we are down to $60M. (Still profitable, thankfully, but boring.) Life was much more fun before we got hedge-hogged.    Avoid at all costs, unless you are a fox and read it to learn what the hedge hogs are thinking.
0446677450|5.0|I read this book cover to cover in a weekend. I now think about money differently than I had in the past. I have read many of Suze Ormon's and David Bach's books and they have helped to educate me, but Rich Dad, Poor Dad has changed my view of finances forever. Poor people work for money. Rich people make their money work for them. Poor people pay too many taxes, interest to the bank and make their employers rich. Rich people find tax loopholes, avoid borrowing money and work for themselves. It all makes sense to me now. I am paying off my rental properties, incorporating my rental business and plan to be semi-retired by age 55 so that I live primarily on the rent and only work part-time to supplement my income. This book has helped me to focus, plan for the future and helped me steer out of debt and closer to retirement. Paying for your child's education is important, but giving them a 2 bedroom, 1 bath house when they graduate from college is equally important. Make them pay you what they would have paid in rent and when the amount is sufficient, allow them to sell the house and buy a bigger one with the money they have paid you. Bypass the bank and interest completely. Let your child be the first generation to break free from mortgage \\"slavery.\\" Demand that they do the same for your grandchildren and keep the ball rolling.
1594201927|3.0|When I was given this book, my heart leapt because I know Niall Ferguson is a robustly contrarian, sharp, articulate and well-informed historian, but it sank immediately that I saw that the book, like many of his recent works, was again based on a television series. Ferguson is a man of genuine talent; it is a shame he chosen to prostitute that talent. No doubt \\"The Ascent of Money\\" made for a TV show of far more than average quality, but the book is necessarily scrappy and somewhat shallow. It seems to evolve according to the picturesqueness of certain locations (the televisual imperative), rather than the logic of the argument.  I would like to see the television link flagged much more prominently on the cover so one is made aware in advance that this is not a serious work of history, but a potboiler designed to raise funds so that Ferguson can boost his earning power to the levels of equally (or less) brainy college contemporaries who went into finance or the law. Frankly, I was disappointed. I hope Ferguson will get back to being a proper historian soon.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|I may say a few things that could be construed as spoilers, but I assure your that it will not take anything away from the movie, as nothing is really intended to shock or surprise you.      This is just too over the top.  This movie is so much of a copy of the matrix it's not even funny, but I'll get to that later.  There is nothing to make you care about the characters. No development at all.  All the action is so, so childish it's not even funny.  The only way it would work is if they took a more care-free approach to the movie, then it would be palpable.  Unfortunately in trying to be cool, they take the whole movie so seriously, which makes it's flaws more memorable that they have to be.  I'm not a snob about action movies, and I really appreciate it when film makers really work outside of the box, but this had no vehicle from which we enter that world.  I liked the first \\"Matrix\\" and I liked \\"Shoot 'em Up.\\"  There was complete suspension of disbelief in both of those examples.  In the matrix, obviously then explain how characters can basically act as God.  In \\"Shoot 'em up\\" they took a slightly silly approach and it really allowed the even the overly critical viewers to just take it easy and enjoy the movie.    Okay, enough with the serious crap.  Assassins that don't work for $$ and kill based on the thread readings of a LOOM!!  Why did anyone allow this in the script?  I can think of a thousand better random ways to instruct assassins...in a movie, of course.  Even worse, somehow it's also based on binary code of the threads.  Edmund Cartwright you murderous A-hole!  Just because you are dead doesn't absolve you of your role in this horrible movie.  He invented the.....never mind.  If some Maytag repairman would just fix the loom, then no one would ever get killed in a completely unrealistic manner.  The shame of it all.  This is the kind of idiot writing that kills a whole movie.  It's kind of like when you meet a person for the first time and they tell youthat they used to drink gravy or used an extension cord as toilet paper in a \\"pinch\\".  Everything from that point on has the stench of the short bus.       Again, they don't get $ for this, yet they go through 100K+ sports and luxury cars like they are candy bars at a fat camp. How do they afford this?...Exactly.    The action is supposed to be really slick, cool and innovative.  It's just cheesy though.  This is close to being a spoiler, but I don't consider it one.  There a scene where someone gets shot from an extreme distance.  For some bizarre reason, that shooter marked the spot that the victim will stand in advance.  My best guess is that it's supposed to show how premeditated/methodical the shooter was, but it's just childish and just plain dumb.  \\"X marks the spot\\"?  Film makers are you out of your damn, pirate-obsessed minds?  That sounds really cool if.... you're an idiot.  By the way, when someone gets shot in a movie show the damn spatter.  Don't hold out on us.  If you are going to watch the movie purely for the action/violence, the movie is exactly as effective as a clothed porno.  It's just weak.    To sum it up, this movie is created for people with bad taste in movies.  It probably has happened to everyone, when they really remember liking a movie or show when you were 13, then you watch it as an adult and you are truly ashamed.  This movie will be the \\"A-team\\" of this generation.    My recommendation is that you should just ignore this movie and watch \\"Shoot 'em Up\\"
B001ILHY1I|4.0|DEATH RACE basically revolves around a reality show in which inmates of the world's most dangerous prison race heavily modified and heavily armed vehicles on a track. There are no rules and the object of the race is to be the last person alive. If a prisoner wins five Death Races, he's a free man. Jason Statham plays a prisoner who is given the task of portraying a character named Frankenstein, a masked and disfigured racer who was killed on the track by another prisoner named Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson). However, because Frankenstein was a huge ratings draw his death was covered up and played off as just an injury. So all Jason Statham has to do is don Frankenstein's mask and keep the legend of the character alive. There are a few twists involving why he's in prison and why he's the person chosen to play Frankenstein, but you'll find it all out when you watch the movie... or read the back of the freakin DVD cover.<br /><br />This movie is not very similar at all to the original \\"[[ASIN:B000B8QFZU Death Race]]\\". In the original movie, the Death Race was a game in which drivers hit random pedestrians and accumulated points based on their victim's age, gender, disability, so on and so forth. A pretty awesome idea for a movie if you ask me! The only thing similar with the new DEATH RACE are the characters of Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe. When I heard about how much changes were going to be made with this new movie I was pretty disappointed and didn't have any desire to see it whatsoever. And it doesn't help that I'm not the biggest Jason Statham fan. However, with a DVD release I thought I would give this movie a shot and I'm actually pretty glad I did. The plot isn't as dumb as I thought it would be and actually came off quite well. The actual script is pretty dumb and is a little too [[ASIN:B00008MZ0N fast and furious]] for my taste, but the overall movie is well done. The pace is extremlely fast and the Unrated version which is almost two hours, went by very quickly. There was never a dull moment in this film.<br /><br />The whole movie definitely has a Post-Apocalyptic vibe to it even though it only takes place in 2012. From the look of the prison to the look of the vehicles, there is a slight MAD MAX feel to it, but for the most part it stays with the times. The cars in the movie are pretty impressive, especially a monstrosity of a vehicle called the Dreadnought which acts as an obstacle in the race. It's like [[ASIN:B00006FD9G Mechagodzilla]] on wheels. The theatrical version of this film is rated R, but surprisingly there isn't a whole lot of gore in the movie. One person gets obliterated by a vehicle in borderline ROBOCOP fashion but that's about it.<br /><br />If you can suspend your disbelief and not take DEATH RACE too seriously, you'll probably enjoy it. Normally, I hate most big budget Action movies that are heavy on the special effects, but I was really surprised by how awesome DEATH RACE is. There were a few things I absolutely hated about it though. The main thing was the script and the dialogue, but coming from Paul W.S. Anderson, I should have had low expectations. More often than not, DEATH RACE delves into FAST AND THE FURIOUS territory thanks to the lead female character in the film who is basically Frankenstein's assistant. An extremely hot woman in the world's most dangerous prison that's made up of all MEN?? Yeah... OK. I'm all for suspending one's disbelief but there are a few things I can't get over and DEATH RACE pushes the envelope as far as that's concerned. I could go off on a rant about how pea brained the script is, but I won't. The action sequences and the characters more than make up for it. The bottom line is on an entertainment level, DEATH RACE is easily a five star movie. If I were to rate this movie on an intelligence level, then it would probably be a two star movie. As an overall package, which is essentially an Action film, it more than delivers. If you're looking for a fun moviethen you won't be disappointed with this one.<br /><br />4 starsointed with this one.    4 stars

Also if you plan on downloading this movie to your PSP, don't. If you purchase this movie on PSN it takes up almost if not over 2GB & a computer converted DVD rip takes up at Media Boss's lowest quality almost 400MB, I have a 4GB & 8GB Memory Stick for my PSP, but with all the movies, music, & games I put on them the UMD copy of T2 was worth the price, although I wish it was cheaper, since I bought T1 & T3 for about 10 bucks apiece. One last thought & that is if you don't mind taking up 2 Gigs of memory or having less than perfect sound than download it, otherwise if you want DVD quality picture & sound this is perfect. That's why I give it 4 stars.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|This is the wondrous film that created Audrey Hepburn's enduring and iconic image:  The sublime Givenchy gown, the oversized sunglasses, the glamorous streaked updo, her own yards and yards of sophistication and chic.  If you hit puberty in the 60's as I did, this film presented one classic character to \\"wanna be\\": Holly Golightly via Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is not without its flaws but what isn't in this world? It's a glossy, frothy, romantic glimpse into a window of time 50 years ago.<br /><br />It's about Holly, a sometimes well-paid \\"party girl\\" living by her wits and on her charms in Manhattan during the early 60's.  It took me years to truly absorb that Holly was \\"paid for her favors\\" - primarily because imagining Audrey Hepburn as such was inconceivable.  I actually believed Holly was given money from admiring men \\"just\\" to go to the powder room.  I probably thought: who wouldn't give Holly/Audrey money simply for the pleasure of her delightful presence?<br /><br />As it turns out, Holly's some kind of beautiful hillbilly who's drifted her way to the fringe of celebrity, from yahooville to Hollywood to New York.  She's living \\"La Dolce Vita\\" with \\"the jet set,\\" but she's in survival mode, avidly looking for a rich husband and security.  Holly meets Varjak, Paul/aka \\"Fred\\" (George Peppard), a struggling writer, when he moves into her building.  Holly learns that he's kept by a wealthy, older married woman (Patricia Neal) and the two bond.  Things get complicated, as things always do, but things never get dull...<br /><br />At one time the casting of George Peppard bothered me. Now, not so much -even after having read that Steve McQueen had been considered for the part.  McQueen might have been great, but I like Peppard just fine.  Paul Varjak is supposed to be a \\"square,\\" and Peppard does a good job portraying the bemused outside observer of Holly's \\"swinging scene.\\"<br /><br />Much has been said of Mickey Rooney as Holly's upstairs neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. Today playing an ethnic character this broadly and with buffoonery is NOT DONE - totally politically incorrect, and rightly so.  However, when \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" was made in 1961 it was not yet the end of the era in which caricaturing non-WASPS was common.  I'm not saying it was a good thing and I'm not defending it, I'm just saying it's best to keep in mind that times hadn't changed yet when Rooney played Yunioshi.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" boasts a solid supporting cast: Patricia Neal (mentioned above), Martin Balsam as fast talking movie-man, O.J. Berman, Buddy Ebsen as Doc Golightly and - not to forget - \\"Cat,\\" a pivotal character.<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" launched Audrey Hepburn, but this is the film that made her a legend.

B000056HE9|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Christmas classics.  Though I hadn't heard of and didn't see the film until 1980, it immediately joined the ranks of my holiday favorites - at the top of the list.  Here's why:<br /><br />1.  Cary Grant as an angel. This is perfect casting and the elegant Mr. Grant plays Dudley with effortless aplomb and grace.  The role was made for him and without him the film would probably not be the classic it is (who else could've played an angel and not seemed ridiculous?).  Watching each woman in the film fall under his charismatic and kindly spell is special fun.<br /><br />2.  A wonderful supporting cast: Loretta Young, David Niven, James Gleason, Gladys Cooper, Elsa Lanchester, Monty Woolley, Sara Haden, Regis Toomey.  This is a splendid ensemble cast and every member delivers.  I especially enjoy the great Glady's Cooper's arrogant and demanding aristocrat, Mrs. Hamilton, who becomes putty in Dudley's presence, and the always excellent James Gleason as the cabby, Sylvester.  But Niven, Lanchester, Woolley and Haden are all standouts.  Loretta Young's soft and astonishing beauty assist her well in the title role as the rather sheltered and innocent but increasingly unhappy wife of a bishop (Niven) who is in the process of losing his way.<br /><br />3. A good old fashioned Christmas message.  The moral of the story is that Christmas is about peace on earth and goodwill toward others, not  material objects (gifts, cathedrals, etc.) or personal glory. The plot delivers this message gently and well.<br /><br />4.  It's a Sam Goldwyn film, so it's first rate.  Aside from the long, deep list of stars and solid supporting actors, the production is sleek and goodlooking, the plot is engaging, the script facile and often clever and amusing.<br /><br />Since I first saw \\"The Bishop's Wife,\\" I've become aware of other classic holiday films (THANKS TO TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES) that were unknown to me before: \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" (Judy Garland) and \\"Christmas in Connecticut\\" (Barbara Stanwyck) in particular.

B00005JKGZ|5.0|There are many things to love about this film.  Where to begin?  Judy Garland - lovely and lyrical as Esther Smith, one of four sisters of an upper class St. Louis family circa 1903/1904.  She's the heart of the story and her romance with \\"The Boy Next Door\\" (Tom Drake) is just plain sweet.  Among many great songs she sings in the film standouts include the song mentioned above, Academy Award-nominated \\"The Trolley Song (\\"clang, clang, clang went the trolley...\\") and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" (heart-melting). There's Margaret O'Brien as her precocious little sister, \\"Tootie,\\" whose Halloween adventure is almost a subplot. A great supporting cast includes Mary Astor, Leon Ames, Harry Davenport, Marjorie Main and Chill Wills.<br /><br />\\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" was directed by one of Hollywood's greatest directors, Vincente Minnelli (\\"An American in Paris,\\" \\"Father of the Bride,\\" \\"The Bad and the Beautiful,\\" \\"Gigi,\\" \\"Some Came Running\\"). This  is one of his masterpieces and I can't praise his artistry in this film enough.  That it didn't walk away with a shelf of Oscars is stunning.  Margaret O'Brien got a special award for her work as a \\"juvenile,\\" but other awards for which it was nominated - screenplay, color cinematography, music/song, and musical picture score went to others.  History shows that winners in some of these categories, \\"Cover Girl\\" and \\"Wilson,\\" haven't withstood the test of time as well as \\"Meet Me in St. Louis.\\"<br /><br />Essentially this enchanting family story stirs one's own nostalgia and idyllic childhood memories...Three generations of the Smith family live under one roof in a great, sprawling house in a very nice section of St. Louis.  There's lovable Grandpa Smith, a spry old dear (Harry Davenport).  Mr. Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames)is the father of the family, a prosperous attorney who works hard to support the entire brood - he's bluff and gruff but a caring son, husband and father.  His loving wife, Anna (Mary Astor), manages the household with the help of eccentric cook/housekeeper, Katie (Marjorie Main). The children, a son and four younger daughters, are at different stages in their lives: Lon, Jr. is going off to Princeton and the youngest, Tootie, is not yet in grammar school.

Ignore the reviews by people who think Wallace's fiction is accessible only to academics and literary pros. Great literature is for everyone, and Infinite Jest is great. Its multi-faceted story and spectacular language are the work of a master. And unlike some of its imitations, Infinite Jest is both profound and funny.       A caveat: this is not the kind of book you can pick up and put down. You really need to read it daily in order to keep track of the many characters and stories. But it's a lot of fun.

B0010X745K|1.0|Hey, I like realistic movies with realism, but that's not why I watch science fiction and fantasy movies. I watch them to have fun and enjoy myself.    Up until the ending, the movie was good. It seems odd that people struggling so hard to survive would just up and quit so easily. They just turned out to be a pathetic bunch of losers. Also, as they were driving down the highway, they passed hundreds of cars that would surely have had gas in them. When they were getting low on gas they could have changed cars. There was no need to run completely out of gas. Only a bonehead would have them do that. I mean they escape and go through all that and run out of gas with plenty of cars all around them? Duh.     It's not logical for them to commit suicide while there is a possible means of escape. Switching cars and continuing their journey seems to me a logical and elegant way to stay in the game. So, how could the director overlook such a simple way to have them survive? It doesn't make sense.    Of course if someone is one of the new dumbed down generation then this absurd ending will probably have them titillated to such a degree that they'll never realize they forgot to think while watching the movie.    So, the director suddenly changed the characters into mindless stupid wimps just to show how wonderful he was at surprising people with a pointless ending? That's supposed to be good directing?
B000R7HY0K|4.0|If it wasn't for the bad acting in the second half of this film -  Rosario Dawson excluded - i would've given it a five star .   The film in short is about psycho stunt man stalker , who kills women using his stunt car . How ? watch the film .  And since it's a tribute to the exploitation films of the past , you'll be treated with coloring problems , sound problems , glitches and that old films lines that shows up on the screen every now and then .Nice .    What ruined the film for me is the bad acting from Tracie Thoms in the second half of the film . She was like a bad female version of Samuel L. Jackson . You can forgive Zoe Bell because she's a stunt woman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for having a small role , unless Mr. Tarantino wanted them to act like that , But we can't know that .

The song \\"Going To California\\" is nowhere to be seen on this album, which I found to be a big disappointment. \\"Going To California\\" is one of Zeppelin's greatest hits to be sure, and a personal favorite of mine as well. This album came so close to being the perfect compilation, but fell just short.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|My 3 year old son loves it.  My husband and I think it's hilarious.  The only down side is that my son thinks it's okay to use kung fu moves on us.  If he does, we put the movie in time out for a week or two.  That works really well.  If you like Jack Black, this is the movie for you.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Continues to be a fantastic movie whether black and white or in color, video or dvd....This is a classic...Item was just as described, deliver quickly and in perfect condition    A great family movie for any time but especially Christmas Time....
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Was skeptical to spend 2 and a half hours to watch a lame, comic-book inspired, predictable, unrealistic, paper-mache-acted, and insanely overhyped film.  I'm glad I was dead wrong.  I'm not a huge movie buff, but my favorites are almost always intelligent, stylized, off-center, masterfully directed crime-dramas.  Didn't think that The Dark Knight would fit that category: It did.  Wonderfully.    Its absolutely impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  I'm not sure if it was the director's intention (although it seems clearly so), but I found myself not caring much about Batman.  I found the Joker and Harvey Dent much more memorable, interesting, multi-faceted, and empathetically flawed.  I didn't see the Joker as evil at all: Just a man answering his true calling, sometimes at the expense of a few lives and structures.  He and Dent show that time and hardship shape a person considerably more than quick gratification, wealth, and being lauded for doing \\"good,\\" as Batman experiences.  While Batman is aloof and guarded, and  the Joker is extroverted, daring, and well-defined by his experiences, which he impresses upon Dent. Not sure how it made a PG-13 rating.  Even with no cursing or sexuality at all, this movie is clearly for an adult audience, with its twisting messages on morality, decision-making, and views on humanity.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who digs thought-provoking, beautifully-shot, roller-coaster films.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This new Nickleback album is fabulous.  The music is great, the lyrics are direct and to the point.  I love it.
B000TGCR38|5.0|this is a very intriguing movie with a great storyline. also, i believe it is based on an actual event. the action scenes do get a little unbelievable, however the main movie theme is delivered in great fashion. that theme would be that it is hard to know who to trust in a wartime situation. who was really on your side and who was not. it is taking place during german occupation of holland during ww2. i highly recommend this movie.
0545128285|4.0|I'm a little conflicted with this book.  I wanted to love it but I can't.  First of all, it's a little more than a 100 pages but the margins are huge and the print is double spaced. So it's basically about 50 pages and that might be stretching it.  Also, the \\"fairy tales\\" are intersting but I was expecting a lot more from Ms. Rowling.  There's not a lot of detail and she gets right to the point.  I think they are excellent for an 8 year old or a little older.  However they are too simplistic for a teenager.  If you go much younger than 8 years old then I feel they may be inappropriate because of the subject material.  I loved Dumbledore's commentary and the fact that they were translated by Herminone Grainer.  Dumbledore's commentary and footnotes really were intesting and explained a lot about history and how things were seen.  I enjoyed the book but just found it way too short.  I hope that J. K. Rowling continues to write in the wizarding world.  Just hope it's longer.  I would recommend this to any Potterheads as long as you know what you are getting.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Even when Paramount \\"Always\\" forget the spanish talking people, by not putting the option of languague or at least subtitles, this show is great, simply fantastic, i will recommended por everyone to see. So... engage!
B001FEO6PK|5.0|This new CD was my first experience with the guitar of Jason Becker. Most of the CD is mellow and without lyrics, so I find it nice to study to. Jason has an interesting style and is an excellent rock composer, despite his disability. This CD includes a letter from Jason Becker and a few hidden tracks if you check it out with a computer. All very impressive! If you haven't given him a chance yet, make sure you hear Jason Becker's work.

B000I0QK74|5.0|I'm a huge Christmas music fan.  32 CDs in my collection . . . and still buy a new one each year.  The day after Thanksgiving I just put them on multi-disc player suffle and let play until December 26th.  [The time-frame is family member enforced :( ]    Like a child, I like to open and play the new Christmas CD sans any pre-research or opinion reading.  I don't want to be prejudiced.  Sometimes they are a total bust/disappointment (i.e., Mary Chapin-Carpenter's Come Darkness, Come Light) and sometimes they are a joyful, not-a-bad-track-on-the-entire-CD, full-out pleasure to listen to again and again.    That's how I feel about the James Taylor at Christmas CD -- two years running.  It's wonderful in song selection, arrangement, production, and James and guests are in fine voice.  You can acutally hear in their voices that they enjoyed making this music -- at least that's how it sounds to me.  Whether you have a large or small Christmas music collection, this one is worth adding.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Honestly one of the best most moving movies I have even seen.  The music played and sang with the images of the movie make it SUPER! The Beatles music so perfectly fit the images I watched it twice in one night. Since I was in college in the 60's I could identify with the emotions on both sides SINCE I had just finished my military tour.
B001EYGOG0|5.0|My family loves big band music, and this cd is great for the holidays.  Classic Tony Bennett and the fantastic band are a one of our favorites!
0767827902|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner. I had forgotten that Cloris Leachman was such a great actress.
0143034901|5.0|As with all works of lasting literary merit, The Shadow of the Wind is diffused with language invented by the author to evoke images of such force, passion, and beauty that the words themselves take on a life of their own.  Chapter Thirty comes to mind immediately.  I study Zafon's scene and characteriztion; his unparelled choice of words that paint a portrait of the Tenebrarium and its occupants so vivid and hilarious that I must return to it time and again for inspiration. Yes, he is in the same class as every master of the art of writing.  I eagerly await his next novel and a return to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.
031606792X|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of the Twilight books will definitely want to read this one.There are so many surprises, both good and bad. Just like the others in the series, you just can't stop reading, but you don't want it to end.
B000000W5L|5.0|There has long been a Beatles vs. Stones battle. The Beatles, in my opinion, are in a class of their own. The Stones, though, deserve their World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll band moniker, the Beatles being more of a pop band. If I was stranded on the proverbial desert island with only one album, this would be it. It is the Stones at their finest. It is raw and emotional. It promotes hip shaking.<br /><br />I don't review music because it is so highly personal. I made an exception for this one.

B0000AM6IY|2.0|Sorry, didn't get it. Not my cup of tea. I think you have to be either a card carrying member AARP or you know, appreciate of the arts to enjoy this sing songy blah blah blah movie with no explosions or sex scenes. I'm neither.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|Love getting all the Rocky movies for such a great price, bought it for my husbands birthday and he loves it!!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I cannot believe all these interminable reviews. Do these people actually think anyone has time to read their massive missives?    Here's the thing, buy the DVD. Watch it lots of times. I've seen it maybe 50 times and just the last time I saw it did I catch the last thing that Katherine wrote in Almasys' Herodotus as she died.   And then I noticed Minghella's shot after Almasy jumps from the train, how he's framed against the blue sky as the music swells and  then there's Fiennes fierce face.   Every time I see it, I catch something new, there's so much going on that it's like a piece of music for me, it keeps revealing itself. Maybe that was Minghella's gift.  I love this movie slavishly, the way some love Casablanca or Star Wars.
B000006OAM|5.0|I didn't care much for Tigerlily (except Carnival and to a lesser extent, Wonder), but I listened to Ophelia on repeat for the better half of a year! This is a mature and thoughtful album. The song type isn't incredibly varied (they are all rather serious and slow), but if you like lyrics to carry a song, this is your kind of album.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|The film Zoolander, despite it's lack of juanty musical numbers like 'I Feel Pretty',  was better than West Side Story, which I just finished watching and found to be rather preachy and dull, which Zoolander most suredly was not.
B00005JPO1|5.0|great special features and the movie is a great popcorn movie. i won't review movie (ending is over the top)
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Wow, I must say that I have not been as disappointed in any movie in a long, long time. Considering I love the all star cast and the number of people that told me \\"IT WAS HILARIOUS!\\", and I did like the trailors I saw, I was expecting a great movie. And if not great, at least funny.<br /><br />Aside from a brief laugh in the beginning, I spent the bulk of the movie trying very hard to not stop it and kept telling myself \\"give it time and it will get better\\". It never did.<br /><br />I wont go in to the plot or anything else, other then to say, I was 100% disappointed and you could not pay me to watch this again...Loved the cast..but the movie simply stunk. Save your money...This is not worth $1 at a garage sale. I know others like it as many told me it was hilarious and I would love it....but as I said, it simply stunk in my opinion.<br /><br />If AMZN would allow a ZERO star rating, I would give this ZERO stars. I would almost prefer to go scoop the poop out of the yard then to have to watch this again.<br /><br />They took an all star cast that I felt would be impossible to \\"miss\\" with yet did just that. How can stiller and black not be funny? Especially on the same set? Add in Downey and Nolte and Tom Cruise with that \\"funny look\\" and how could this be so bad? I dont know, but it is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This is a great movie, very well done, and Christian Bale is amazing.  If you like this movie, try \\"The Tenant\\", an early Roman Polanski effort.  It is very similar in vibe, and I have a feeling that the director of The Machinist may have seen it more than once...
159448385X|3.0|I thought this book was very well written and told a good story; however, there is enough sadness in today's world, and on the news, that I found the story too depressing.  I'm not saying I wish the author would have changed events or gave it a happy ending, I just wish I had chosen another book to read.
B00104W8T6|4.0|Fast service. CD was in great condition and was all and more than I could ask for!
0792839730|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best WWII movie ever made.  Actually depicts the politics that went on behind the scenes as well as the action on the field.
B001DWNUCO|5.0|After seeing this particular movie advertised in various sites, I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase it to see what all the hype is about - I am the type of person that do not like to rent, therefore, I purchase all of my movies typically based on reviews. Anyhow, all I have to say in summing up this movie is that it is basically porn made by Hollywood. The only time I have ever seen so much skin exposed is when watching porn. Obviously, this movie is porn in sheep's clothing. The storyline is good, the picture quality is good (especially on Blu-ray and given when this movie was made). Overall, its satisfying enough, but not something I would probably watch over and over.

1932907009|5.0|I have read a vast number of screenwriting tutorials, STC! is far and away the best.  Anybody who is remotely serious about screenwriting should read this book -- and have it by their side while writing.    I'm preparing for my next screenplay, and I'm following Blake's guidelines to the letter.  I'm extremely anxious to see how this script will be perceived in the marketplace.  I always send my scripts in for coverage service, and this will be an interesting test.  Will the editor/reader applaud my structure?  I have a feeling he/she will.    Blake is entirely genuine and entertaining.  While he tells us about the necessities for a powerful screenplay, he addresses the little curiosities we all have about the life of a screenwriter in Hollywood.  I love it!    I'm looking forward to reading the sequel...STC2!  :)    My humble opinion: you simply cannot be serious about screenwriting if you are unwilling to shell out a few bucks to get fresh, credentialed, industry advice.    BUY THE BOOK!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Very good album. The songs are not the traditional versions of Christmas songs, but they are aranged in Enya's beutiful sytle. Some of the songs are different enough and not so Christmasy that they can be listened to year round. I'm glad I added it to my music collection.
B00155V5OO|5.0|The Testament has an even pace yet catches you at the ending.  One of Grisham's better books on the Level of Painted House or Skipping Christmas.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Excellent movie that is already a classic. My grandson thoroughly enjoyed it, which is refreshing considering the stuff he usually watches!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I bought this cd because I really liked the books, had seen the movie, and I knew I would at least like the Muse and Paramore tracks.  I listened to the samples of each song, and though I wasn't excited about them all, none of them deterred me from going ahead and buying it.  I'm glad I did.  At first, I was stuck on the songs that I had expected to like, but after listening to it a couple of times, I began to like all of them more and more.  I was pleasantly surprised that the more quirky additions from Mutemath, Perry Farrell, Blue Foundation, and Iron and Wine started to grow on me.  Only a few of the songs really evoke the feel of the movie, but overall, it's a strong collection of songs.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|The sun is dying. Earth is in the middle of permanent winter. A gigantic ship called Icharis has been lost. Icharis contained a small crew and enough fissile material to re-ignite the sun. Now what? Icharis 2 is on its way! SUNSHINE is a tense, slowly-building tale of hope, desperation, insanity, and ultimate sacrifice. Would you give your life in order to save the world? This question is asked throughout the movie, as each member of the I2 crew faces extinction. If you enjoy sci-fi that stimulates the old cranial area, then SUNSHINE should be a treat. Yes, there are huge thrills and unexpected chills, but the story is quite well thought out, and adds depth to the visual extravaganza. Highly recommended...

B000UR9T8C|1.0|I am a huge fan of the first 2 Spidey movies, and in hopes that the 3rd one would be even better than others, I sprung the $20 to see it at an Imax theater.  By the time it was over, I felt like I'd just been launched out of a washing machine on spin mode.  \\"Action-packed\\" is an accurate and (in this case) unflattering way to describe this film.  With a slew of underdeveloped (and unecessary) villians and a massive budget for special affects, there were fight sequences and disasters galore - none of which resulted in anything more than a jumbled mess.     You KNOW a movie is bad when it involves amnesia, love trinagles, alien viruses, not-so-secret secret identities, and a random Jim Carrey-esque dance sequence by Tobey Maguire all in one film.  To say this movie had WAAAYY too much going on would be the understatement of the century.  There were more subplots and side characters than an episode of the Love Boat!      Afte seeing the movie, I asked other people in my office what they thought of it.  The men [shocker] loved it because of all the action, while women like myself (who also like action but enjoy other things like a good plot, decent writing, and uh, I don't know?  Logic!) agreed with me that it was terrible.    Normally, I'd roll my eyes at the mere mention of a fourth installment of anything, but Spidey 3 was so bad, I want them to make one more because I feel the director owes me a good movie after serving up this rotten slice of insanity that I had looked forwrd to seeing for months.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|There have been a couple of good movies I was disappointed with how they turned out on Blu Ray. When your paying up to 10$ more for the hi res version you expect something that looks better then standard def. This movie did not disappoint. Just as good as seeing it in the movies.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Planet Earth is quite simply the greatest nature and wildlife series ever produced. This astonishing 11-part BBC series is brilliantly narrated by Sir David Attenborough which covers a specific geographical region and wildlife habitat each episode until the entire planet has been magnificently represented by the most astonishing sights and sounds you'll ever experience. The series delivers a seemingly endless variety of natural wonders, from the spectacular mating displays of New Guinea's various birds of paradise to a rare encounter with Siberia's nearly-extinct Amur Leopards, of which only 30 remain in the wild. To the wilderness of many countries of mountains, lakes, caves, open plains and oceans.<br /><br />Accompanied by majestic orchestral scores by George Fenton, every episode is packed with images so beautiful or so forcefully impressive (and so perfectly photographed by the BBC's tenacious high-definition camera crews) that you'll be rendered speechless by the splendor of it all. Masterfully filmed from every conceivable angle, with frequent use of super-slow-motion and amazing motion-controlled time-lapse cinematography, and narrated by Attenborough with his trademark combination of observational wit and informative authority. The result is a hugely entertaining series that doesn't flinch from the predatory realities of nature. Fitted with some of the best animal behaviour fottage ever caputerd this is easily the best documentry ever filmed and is a stand alone masterpiece for all ages.

B000ATQYT2|1.0|I was happily watching my VHS copy of The Muppet Christmas Carol with my lovely wife the other evening and decided it was time to own it on DVD. I popped open my laptop and ordered it as the movie was playing on the TV. Sadly I did not take time to read the reviews before placing my order because if I had known that the song, \\"When Love is Gone\\", was omitted from the widescreen version, I would have saved my money. So I can watch the complete film by choosing the 4:3 aspect ratio option but the image quality is vastly inferior to the 16:9 presentation. Basically I paid fifteen bucks for nothing. Thanks a bunch, Disney. Bite me.
0618918248|4.0|The God Delusion is Richard Dawkins' atheist manifesto.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins thoroughly dissects common arguments for God's existence, while presenting his incontrovertible assertion of God's non-existence, chiefly that such an assumption represents an infinite regress.  After dealing with this central point of contention, he proceeds to analyze religion and its tenuous connection to morality.<br /><br />Never one to mince words, Mr. Dawkins has plenty of cutting, often witty, remarks against faith and religion.  His views are rooted strictly in science, and he makes no apologies about questions for which science does not provide adequate answers.  Those questions should be seen as a opportunity for the pursuit of knowledge, he suggests, rather than defaulting to unquestioning religious perspectives.<br /><br />I usually take notes while reading, in order to reinforce the material.  But the arguments presented in The God Delusion seemed so logical, indeed almost intuitive in presentation, that taking notes was almost not worth the effort.  Mr. Dawkins, while possessing deep and scientific knowledge, is also capable of writing with clarity for a wide audience.<br /><br />While I'm not sure how many atheist converts Mr. Dawkins will gain through this book (one of his stated goals), he does provide an enlightening perspective on religion and an inspiring view of science.  Open-minded and scientifically-inclined readers will enjoy this book.  Those unwilling to question their faith should avoid it.
B000065V42|3.0|Although it's a bit dated, Honey I Shrunk the Kids is still a fun family movie.    However, I'm disappointed with the DVD edition.  First, the video is \\"fullscreen\\" 4:3.   There is no widescreen option for newer 16:9 displays.  Second, the video quality is poor - you can see many video artifacts such as noise on the display.  It looks like you're watching a VHS videotape.    Your kids probably won't care about the picture quality, but it might bug the parents if you're watching along.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook, the appropriate winner of American Idol, has a freshman CD that will blow you away.  Not only is Light On being played on air on most radio stations I listen to, but the CD is full of other songs that can truly become singles in their own right.  His vocals are strong, the band sounds great and his style continues to be strong enough to pull in listeners from all ages.  I am 55 and an avid rock/blues music listener.  Not only is this guy super sexy, but the CD is a must buy. I simply cannot wait to see his carreer soar, and am anxiously awaiting his 2nd CD.  I play this constantly and am never bored with it!  Hope he and the band can go on tour soon, I want tickets, and will go wherever I need to.  David Cook is a star in the making!  Stay tuned music fans, this is not the last you will hear from him!  Get a copy of Light On for yourself and anyone else who loves rock.  It is a five star CD in my opinion!

1594489505|4.0|The beginning of the book was a a little dry in my opinion and I had a hard time making it through it.  I kept reading a little, getting bored and coming back to it in a month or so.  Anyways, somewhere in the middle things really started picking up, and finished up very strong. I was impressed, and it was a good story, although not quite as good as The Kite Runner.    EDIT: In reminiscing about both books today, I realized that both are very intriguing looks into the humanity of individuals.  Both are great reads.

I knew what was going to happen before it did happen, expected the outcome and finished the book uninspired and looking for a Days of Our Lives episode.<br /><br />If you want fluff to forget your woes, read the book (or watch Samantha Who) but if you are looking for spark, romance, and a little tear jerk action, look elsewhere.

B0002G2B2M|5.0|What an intriguing idea for a story, a man and woman meet, fall in love, fall out of love, have their memories of the whole love experience erased from their memories by a reverse brain mapping process.  Who among us would not jump at the possibility of erasing painful or unpleasant memories and then be able move on with our lives with no recollection of anything associated with the person we had wiped from our memory.<br /><br />The lead characters in the story Joel and Clementine meet and fall and love, but after a period of few years they have drifted apart.  Clementine discovers a doctor, who offers a service where he can erase memories of a particular person from your mind.  Part of the process of forgetting is remembering.  In order to map all the areas of the brain where the memories reside; the person wanting to forget has to collect all items associated with the person they are trying to forget.  These items are shown to the individual, who is trying to forget and as they view the object a map of brain's reaction to the stimulus is created.  Through the marvel of modern science this brain map is then used to execute a pinpoint destruction of the memories.  Clementine successfully undergoes this procedure and completely erases any memories of Joel.  Presumably, she is now free of the pain of a failed relationship.  Joel is now a complete stranger to Clementine.<br /><br />Later, Joel is told by a friend that Clementine has had all memories of him erased and he becomes interested in doing the same with his memories of Clementine.  We are then treated to the spectacle of Joel having all memories of Clementine zapped.  The erasing is done while Joel is sleeping and the \\"technicians\\" drink, party and mess around during the process, in a startling display of indifference to what is being done to this person.  Perhaps this is an indictment against the medical community that treats our mental anguish and discomfort with drugs or other means with a sort of detachment from what other damage may be inflicted on the individual.<br /><br />As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed.  Other memories from his childhood become more vivid and we can clearly see that all his memories work together to create the person that is Joel.  That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film.  We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche.  We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good.  Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own mapr damage may be inflicted on the individual.    As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed.

That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film.  We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche.  We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good.  Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own map
B00004RFFS|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT TWO TOP MALE BOX OFFICE MEGA STARS. I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF BOTH CRUISE AND PITT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I HAVE SEEN ALL OF THEIR FILMS. I THOUGHT WHEN THIS FILM CAME OUT, WOW HOW DID THEY MANAGE THIS? TOM CRUISE AND BRAD PITT BOTH HEADLINEING A FILM ABOUT VAMPIRES.    THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO ACTORS IS FANTASTIC. GOOD VERSES EVIL, BRADS VAMPIRE WITH A HEART AND CRUISES INDIFFERENCE PLAY OFF EACH OTHER LIKE A BOW AND VIOLIN. THIS FILM HAS SPARK AND MAGIC. THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES FANTASY. A GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR FILM LIBRARY.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I had bought a few books from amazon and needed 10 bucks more to get free shipping, so I browsed a few movies. I came across the Gilmore Girls collection and remembered watching an episode or two a few years back and after reading the fantastic reviews, purchased the first season. I love the witty dialogue and refreshing characters and found myself immensly enjoying ALL of the subplots, which is something that doesn't happen to often for me. I'm now buying a season whenever I have a break from school and hopefully I'll own the complete series for years to come!
1400082773|5.0|An outsanding view of how a multiracial young man is molded into an understanding adult. No wonder that Barack can see issues in a way that makes him a level above almost any polititian that has achieved national prominence in the last 50 years. He truly is a gift to the nation at this time and this book shows how that across racial, gender and ethnic origins is primary in that achievement.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is enjoyable for the entire family.  I had my cell group over for a movie night and young and old enjoyed it alike.
0679720200|5.0|The theme of a universe formed by the absurd and incomprehensible--a universe and its societies that claims to respect and embrace truth, impassive justness, and simplicity, yet, at the same time, condemns people that personify and act as paragons for such ideals, thrusting them into a life of ignominy--this theme has not been lost since 'The Stranger' made its first appearance; and, I dare say, in this world of reemerging religious idealism in the form of Evangelical Christianity in America, Islamic terrorism throughout the world, manipulation and adulteration of Buddhist principles in Burma, pious clashes in Darfur, equally idealistic atheism/secularism--I dare say that the message is still as relevant as when first presented, if not more so. Camus's impassive yet passionate forthrightness on our world and universe's absurdity has not, nor will it ever, fall upon disconnected ears.
0345410025|5.0|One of the helpful items in the book is the author's point to have \\"original awareness\\". He says that you have to be aware of what you are seeing or reading before any memory device can help. That is a perfect point.<br /><br />Once you are aware of what you want to memorize, you can then use the author's methods to memorize what you want to remember.<br /><br />He has you visualize exaggerated scenes and then has you link them together. He also uses a peg system for ordering so that you don't have to link items together if you don't want to. The peg system is a list of 100 words, each word associated with one of the numbers one through 100. This sounds hard but it really isn't because of the way he teaches you to assign numbers to consonant sounds.<br /><br />His methods have worked for me.
B001KQIAXM|1.0|I was not impressed with the I Am or Sasha Fierce Album. I am.... is an okay album. It does show more of her range but can take at least 15 listens to really appreciate it. There are only 2 (in my opinion) instant hits, which are Halo and If I Were A Boy. Sasha Fierce is not a good album at all. I only like Scared of Lonely and Put a Ring on it. She is really trying to get street cred, and failed at doing so. She is not from the streets and just b/c your husband at one point in time was part of the streets, does not make her able to pull it off. Better luck on album 4. I will listen to the other 2 albums and wait for a better effort from Beyonce.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|It was a wonderful performance and a well produced DVD. Brought tears to my eyes. Rented it on netflix. Now buying from Amazon.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|If you can overlook and ignore the sometimes not so subtle message that humans are polluting the earth you will enjoy a rather cute and funny movie.  Not since \\"Johnny-Five\\" (Short Circuit I & II) have I seen a movie with robots as the principle characters.  It does have a good theme on team work and friendship throughout and Wall-E's eccentric personality shines through it all its circuit-board hilarity.   It is worth having this one to keep with Cars, Toy Story I & II, Short Circuit and other such movies if you are into that genre.
0545128285|4.0|Tales of Beedle the Bard is a collection of short stories by J. K. Rowling dealing with the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Each story has its own lesson for children and also a side note afterwards written by Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable quick read. while most of the stories are geared towards children, there are some that have a bit more violence and should be read to children that are a bit older.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to pass about an hour of time, this will do it. Harry Potter fans will more than likely want this one just to see a bit more inside the tales of Beedle that were hinted at in the Harry Potter series. This book does not expand on the main plot of Harry Potter though. These are children stories and if you do not like reading stories geared to a much younger crowd, then you may want to skip it
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|And Winter Came, enya CD is very nice, background music for a festive holiday feeling.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|I was introduced to Resident Evil by the original games...later they decided to make films BASED on the games, but they were not ever all that great.<br /><br />I saw the first one, and though it had some interesting scenes of how people met their doom. I didnt really like it. It paled in comparison to the games. And the games are far superior in story and in horror and still are to this day (resident evil 4 and 5 as the latest and greatest prime examples of this)<br /><br />Anyways, i even tried watching the second RE film, but that was just so embarrassingly lame, i couldnt watch it all the way through...it might of turned out to be an okay movie, but at the time, i really wasnt impressed at all, i was NOT entertained. but i might go back and check that one out, just to give it another chance.<br /><br />But ya, so far, i never really cared much for the hollywood film adaptations. Until now, because RE-Extinction was actually done in way that does the games some justice, and honors the tradition of the game series way better.<br /><br />Of course the story and things are still just BASED on the games, you dont get a plot by plot similarity at all. But its done well this time around. And i think the monster at the end was impressive. They did a good job representing that thing.<br /><br />Its not really the best acted movie. But it kept me entertained and interested. The part with how they fight off the hundreds of zombie crows was awesome.<br /><br />And the story kind of touches on stuff that was kind of a mystery in the first film and uncovers some 'secrets' in ways.<br />So im actually interested in seeing whats next for this film 'franchise'.<br /><br />I think its worth buying a used copy on amazon for cheap.<br /><br />not a bad movie.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|As a person that attends movies on a weekly bases, I definitely agree that Iron Man movie was the num #1 movie of 2008, followed or pretty much tied with the Batman movie: Dark Knight. I'm really huge on comic books turned movies as long as there done the right way, and so I'm glad to give this movie 5 stars & definitely glad to own it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray dvd came in a timely manner as stated so I appreciate that.
0375831002|4.0|~<br />The narrator of this novel is Death himself, and I can't think of a more appropriate figure to tell this incredible story about life in Nazi Germany in the 1940s.  In this novel, Death has a big heart and admits that humans haunt him. This book, written for young adults, starts when a nine-year-old girl named Liesel has to say good-bye to her mother after she watches her younger brother die.  Liesell is sent to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who become her foster papa and mama.<br /><br />Although this book is intended for young adults, I have to think that it would be best read by an older, young adult, as in a mature 15-20 year old, who also knows a little about WWII, or at the very least is interested in history.  Parts of it move slowly, but even the slow parts have a fantastic poetic storytelling quality.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fantastic, cleverly constructed story with characters that were well conceived and incredibly real. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it; however...I'm not so sure that there are many young teenagers that would have the attention span or the patience to appreciate it as a novel read for enjoyment. In my opinion, this could have easily been a five star book, had it truly been writen as an adult story.<br />4 1/2 stars.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Okay, so I had to be stuck in a plane to watch it all the way through because it's a little (a lot) slow moving.  But overall it's perfect- Eve likes to shoot things, Wall-E is cute, and it has a happy ending.  The movie is sweet. It's the perfect gift for someone you care about.
B000N3ST7K|4.0|The Coasters \\"Down in Mexico\\" and the others are very good. I bought it for 3 songs and ended up enjoying the whole CD, I think you will also.
0525478183|4.0|Ever become so engrossed in a book that when you finally look up for a moment you're surprised to realize it's late?  Very late, and everyone else has gone to bed, and you can't remember when you started or how long you've been reading?  This is the only book by John Green (which happens to be my name, too) that I've read, but I can see why he has such a devoted following.<br /><br />Quentin Jacobsen (Q) has lived next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman since they were two.  They even discovered a suicide victim once when they were ten.  But over the years they've gone separate ways: Margo is the center of the popular crowd at school, and Q is reduced to worshipping her from afar.  But late one night a few weeks before graduation Margo appears at his bedroom window and convinces him to accompany her on a night of payback and revenge.  The next day she disappears, and Q is left to follow a trail of bread crumbs she's left for him.  Has she simply run away... or something worse?  Either way, it's obvious that no one really knew *who* she was to begin with.<br /><br />I was totally surprised at how easily this book sucks you in.  It's a fairly introspective look at life and our sometimes mistaken ideas of those around us.  At first I was disappointed at how crude the language and talk is (plenty of profanity and talk of sex), but as my teenage son pointed out, it's not much different from what he hears every day at school.  I'm not sure that's what I'd encourage him to read, however, but he devoured the book as well and has friends waiting for it after I finish.  And honestly, I rather enjoyed the story.  Still, just because you can't put a book down doesn't guarantee that it's great or even enjoyable.  I can't promise you'll like it, but I suspect it won't take you long to read it.<br /><br />And just a final note - there are two different covers for this book: the bright yellow smiling one, and a darker bluish depressed-looking one.
0143113100|5.0|What I liked about this book was the hope it holds for all of us that if we persevere on a mental or physical path, we may reach a goal that others think impossible.  All those little neurons in the brain that are inching toward each other eventually respond to repetition. It may take a long time, but staying with the task is the key. The case studies were fascinating. There seems to be an explosion of new concepts about the brain and about how to harness its powers in ways we are just beginning to understand. I look forward to more on this frontier.

0375826726|3.0|For any die-hard Inheritance Cycle fan I would not hesitate to purchase this book. I bought it the day it was released and read it in a day and a half.   Despite this, however, I was surprised to find that in comparison to Eragon and Eldest there were points during my reading of the book that I wanted to set it down and go do something else. The chapters involving dwarf politics (which other reviewers seemed to also have found dull) were dragging and mostly irrelevant to the story, and during the dwarf debates Paolini broke a well-known rule of writing about realistic dialogue when Orik spoke for one solid paragraph that lasted an entire page, with nothing to break up the dialogue.   Another, more personal point of annoyance for me was Murtagh's minimal participation in the story, but I just recently read that Paolini has promised that Murtagh will play a very large role in the fourth book, which has me jumping for joy.   An irritation in this book involving the description of Murtagh's hair in Brisingr--\\"His long black hair billowed behind him like a sleek mane\\"--contradicted the one in Eragon stating that he has \\"locks of dark brown hair.\\" Hmm, has he dyed his hair to fit his new darkness? I think not!  The book is littered with several of these minute mistakes, and I must admit that I am disappointed to find them in such a famous book.   That said, I was excited with the addition of Carn, Roran's spellcaster friend, and I found Roran and Katrina to be well-developed characters. King Orrin was fleshed out more also, and instead of being merely an eccentric young man he has become an even better king and leader, and gets to prove his courage on the battlefield.  I will look forward to the conclusion of this cycle and hope that Paolini realizes that when it comes to writing, simplicity is a virtue.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Great music CD, all the  hits that I wanted to hear are on the CD, prompt delivery.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Product came in perfect condition and the seller was a pleasure to do business with.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I have not actually opened the CD yet, it's a Christmas gift for my husband, but we saw the video on TV a few months ago and it was awesome!  So we're looking forward to watching it again soon.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|So everyone on here is talking about the quality of the content on the disc.  Well let me take a step back and describe my experience with Amazon and the DVD, and let you decide the movie for yourself...<br /><br />1) The order... Amazon is burning these as orders come in, which is cost effective and FAST.  Two-Day shipping applies to Prime members.<br /><br />2) The DVD... The box has a very professional looking cover with spine and rear box art.... The only thing I noticed was the cover was a tiny bit fuzzy, probably from a lower printing resolution than normal DVD releases.<br /><br />The disc looks AMAZING.  I pulled it out, and was surprised to see the disc has a printed image ON THE DISC.  This is very professional looking, and is quite impressive when you see it in person.<br /><br />3) The content... It all starts with an impressive animated menu system that makes the film feel like a Hollywood picture.  Very slick looking.  The special features are amazing, including a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film, Commentary! (a commentary track with ALL new music with a behind the scenes feel), and all sorts of other fun little Easter eggs and surprises.<br /><br />This DVD is a wonderful creation.  In my mind, it is totally worth the 10 dollars it costs, and once I received this disc, and seeing what a professional cool experience it is, I wish I had paid more for it.<br /><br />Judge the movie for yourself, but from where I stand, the cool and innovative special features are reason enough to buy this DVD.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my grandson.  I have not seen the movie but he saw it during the summer and loved it, so I know he'll be thrilled to have his own to watch whenever he wants.
B001BTG3OQ|1.0|My first pro use of this speedlight was very disappointing. I was shooting a dance gig with this speedlight combined with the SD 9 battery pack and it cut out early in the shoot. Very glad it was not a wedding!    I replaced the SB900 with my SB 800 and it shot for hours without a problem.    There is a problem with the SB 900.    I do not recommend the SB 900 until nikon fix up this serious flaw.    Cheers  Ron
0765316897|5.0|Originally I picked up this series because Brandon Sanderson was picked to finish the W.O.T. and was curious as to his writing style.  From the beginning of The Final Empire I was addicted.  The character development and dialogue the plot I love everything about these books.<br /><br />Hero of Ages was definitely a great way to resolve this series.  Admittedly, half way through the book I felt that it wasn't going anywhere that it was stuck.  I was mistaken.  The clues were so subtle throughout the entire series that I over looked them completely.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is definitely a master of his craft and I recommend any and all of his current and future titles.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|I've neither read the novel nor seen either of the movies with Mr. Price or Mr. Heston. I am a big fan of Will Smith.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my 13-year-old son. A pair of geeks, I found that we had to stop the movie periodically to explain some of the points my son questioned (like why Smith's character was broadcasting in AM instead of FM.)<br /><br />After the first 1/3rd of the movie, I thought this movie began to have potential to stand as a metaphor for feelings of isolation in today's society. (Gimme a break. I coach/counsel a lot of powerful, isolated men.)<br /><br />Sadly, in a Hollywood way, the movie started to go downhill after the 1st third. Some points that jumped out include:<br /><br />1. Smith's character is a military man who can bobby-trap an entire city block, but is unable to spot (and avoid) a simplistic guerilla trap. (Note to the colonel: \\"Who do you THINK moved Frank the dummy? The deer?!?)<br /><br />2.He's been alone for 3 years and convinced that he's the last person on earth. A beautiful woman comes and literally saves him from death ... and he can barely have a civil conversation with her?<br /><br />3. How did the baddies get into his house at the end? It seemed like Smith's character left a window open in his daughter's room. Again, after locking down the house for 3 years (and it being a matter of life/death), he's gonna forget to close a window?<br /><br />4. Smith's character has the ability to design and construct heavy steel shutters over his house windows, and then builds a laboratory door out of .... what? It looked like cardboard the way those baddies blasted through it.<br /><br />I'm willing to suspend some disbelief when I watch movies, but the ending of this movie had too many holes in it. Even fictional worlds need to have some degree of coherency.
B00009P1MP|2.0|The music is as good as I remember on the vinyl, but the cardboard container (no plastic at all) is getting too cheap.
0810979772|5.0|My 8 year old son loves the book.  He has read the entire series 3 times through.  If this got him to read I can't complain.
B00006IUL2|3.0|Brilliant performing helps a little to comprehend a very context of this dark movie where murdering and body secession constitute the most developments to discuss.<br /><br />Not watching it loses a little.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|Paul McCartney has finally delivered an above average record.  This album harkens back to the \\"off the cuff\\" sounds of RAM.  Paul doesn't worry about things being too slick as on past efforts (Memory Almost Full & Chaos & Creation).  While those are pretty decent records, ELECTRIC ARGUMENTS seems to take an old time approach to recording when things were played with a more spontaneous feel leaving room for \\"happy accidents\\".  Personally, I think that is when Macca is at his creative best.  Opening track, \\"Nothing Too Much Just Outta Sight\\" is a sign Macca can deliver a hard rocking tune when he wants.  \\"Two Magpies\\" has a quirky \\"Three Legs\\" appeal.  There are still some catchy tunes on this...\\"Highway\\" & \\"Sing The Changes\\" could be hit singles, but alas, popular radio doesn't have the room for a new McCartney single to be added to their playlist.  McCartney still can write good songs.  But his time in the spotlight and popularity with the youth of today have no interest...and that's how it should be.  Time moves on.  But that doesn't mean this isn't a great record.  I find the first 8 or 9 songs to be pretty F'ing good.  The last part of the record makes me drift off to sleep with the repetition of trance (not really my bag).  Paul plays all instruments and is one of my more favorite drummers.  He has a simplistic approach to all instruments and is a master of arranging them for a full sound.  I wish he would keep Youth as his producer for future projects.  The guy seems to know how to work McCartney.
0307454894|4.0|Like any fifteen-year-old boy would be, Michael Berg was essentially overwhelmed with the icy good looks of thirty-six-year-old Hanna. Their multi-month affair was intense, awakening, and to some degree exploitative; however, there was a certain reserve and sharpness about Hanna that Michael could never penetrate. Her sudden departure and her memory haunted him for years, but he was completely unprepared for the devastating impact of seeing Hanna as a defendant in a war crimes trial, which he was observing as an assignment for a law school seminar.<br /><br />The facts that Hanna was a Nazi concentration camp guard and that she was one of several guards charged with overseeing female prisoners who burned to death in a locked cathedral after an allied bombing raid are not in dispute. At this point the questions are many: had he years before not seen or simply ignored a propensity for cruelty, could a person in her position realistically defy orders, what is the complicity and culpability of the entire German society relating to Nazi atrocities, and do laws and legal process actually lead to justice? Beyond these reflections, Michael had to decide whether he should make contact with her and in what way.<br /><br />Michael finds no easy answers and is quite equivocal in the manner in which he should now relate to Hanna. It is the discovery of a secret, an unusual shortcoming, of Hanna's that permits him to at least partially understand her past actions and to embark on a course of action that was perhaps all that circumstance allowed.<br /><br />The book is structured as a book within a book with Michael finally capturing the history and his thoughts of his long association with Hanna. Perhaps the reader will want to question what Hanna or Michael could have done differently, but they, as in life, only get one chance. The book proceeds reasonably well considering the frequent reflection and the author's tendency for a somewhat difficult writing style. It is definitely an absorbing and cautionary talenary tale
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|It took me forever to see this movie because of all the hype surrounding it, but once I did, I wanted to kick myself for not seeing it sooner. The Dark Knight is an incredible movie. It's lean in that every word spoken and every camera shot is necessary. Blink, and you'll miss something key.    Heath Ledger's performance was diabolical and magical. He gave us a Joker we could love, hate and most definitely not want to get caught on an elevator with. Ledger gave the Joker a chilling vulnerability and brilliant evil that made watching him a sheer delight.    Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two-Face was equally spectacular while Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine more than held their own in their reprised characters.    Maggie Gyllenhall's Rachel was a seamless portrayal and maintained the fiestiness and independent stubborness of Katie Holmes' Rachel. In a male dominated film, Gyllenhall nicely stood out.    The Dark Knight is a movie I'll watch again and again.
0743290119|5.0|I can't believe all the bad reviews as well...this was a great read, I  liked it even better than Devil Wears Prada.  I think all the negative reviews are unjust, it was a cute, funny book, and I didn't think it was boring at all.  I wouldn't have read/bought this book based on all the bad reviews but my friend (thanks JB!) gave it to me and recommended it.  I'm glad she did!
B000ICM5O4|5.0|This soundtrack is fabulous, just like the film. I think it is a great CD to workout with....Inspiring,to say the least. It was great to hear these tunes, after all these years.ROCKY ROCKS!

B000O5B4C4|4.0|Sharon Stone is in her best years. Beautiful, good actincg. Her skin looks made on velvet.  I enjoy this movie when was on theatres. However the ending is silly, but any way this movie cach you all the time.   As any other serial killer movies is highly unreal, but as well is highly enjoyable.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This album, The Story, by Brandi Carlile is much better than one might think after a few listenings.  It is actually quite remarkable.  The title song is the obvious zinger, but the album is full of very good songs, some as good as \\"The Story,\\" others just a touch under. What brings \\"The Story\\" to the fore is the incredible vocal range Brandi utilizes inside of 3:30 minutes.  It is an extraordinary song, sang by an extraordinary singer.  Although she didn't write \\"The Story,\\" she wrote most of the other tunes on the album, and they are finely crafted songs.  I will be following her career, at least until she disappoints, and I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys a woman who can truly sing.  The only drawback to The Story is it has more songs unlike \\"The Story,\\" than like it.  I really enjoy a woman who can belt out lyrics and then softly return to earth.  Brandi Carlile does that very well, just not as often as I'd like.  Nonetheless, this is easily a five star album.    When I received The Story from a friend, she told me that she is \\"kind of like Lucinda Williams.\\"  I wouldn't go that far, but she does have talent.  Lucinda Williams has thirty years experience making top level albums, and Brandi Carlile has only just begun.  But the likeness is there.  Where I draw the line between Lucinda and Brandi is in the lyrical content.  Lucinda Williams knows no peer in the women's songwriting world.  Brandi may get there, but until she does, I'll be revved up for her next release.
B000VZGK3K|3.0|Very good effects. Good performance of Dicaprio and the other actors. However Mr. Scorsesse had made a movie very tipical from Holywood standards, not as original or intense as Goodfellas. I enjoy the movie, but this not catch me as other works from this director. May be the best years of Scorsesse had gone...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a cinematic masterpiece that will blow your mind. I study ecology but every single episode shows wonders that I did not think were even possible... This is not your normal biology flick - it will enrich anyone's life regardless of interests and dispositions.

B001E7OO2I|5.0|I am really pleased with the John Legend Evolver album release. I think it's a great album which I will always enjoy!
B000002KGT|1.0|This is no knock on the album itself. It's a classic even if some of the songs have been played to death beyond the point of becoming cultural cliches or for those who can't help of \\"Don't Stop\\" being the adopted theme song for Slick Willy, get over it. Plenty of good songs have been hijacked for lousy promotions.  The two Mac albums after Buckingham and Nicks joined are two of the most universally appealing albums ever without being crassly commercial, and in the context of where mainstream pop was when these albums hit the street, these classics were especially welcome. Punk and the new rock bands like the Cars, Van Halen, among others were just beginning to be noticed. The pop stations were playing disco and schmaltzy barph!!    THE WARNING IS ON THE RECORDING IS FOR THE POOR RECORDING QUALITY. THE CD REPRODUCTION IS FAINT, MUFFLED, AND VERY LOW RESOLUTION. THIS MIGHT MAKE IT A REAL STINKER IF YOU'RE DOWNLOADING EVEN WITH VOLUME MAXIMIZERS EMPLOYED. SADLY, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RUSHED TO MARKET STINKERS FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY CORRECTED.  EITHER DOWNLOAD THIS FROM A REPUTABLE SERVICE (AMAZON, I-TUNES) OR BUY THE FANCY VERSION. ON A GOOD STEREO, CRANKING UP THE VOLUME ONLY REVEALS HOW FAINT AND WASHED OUT THE RECORDING IS AND THERE ARE SO MANY COOL LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU'D HAVE HEARD ON THE LP THAT ARE GONE!!!

0316017922|5.0|Outliers, in statistics, are results that are so extreme that they are generally not taken into account in calculations. So extreme that they are literally off the charts. Malcolm Gladwell's book [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]] is about people that experience this kind of extreme success. People like the most succesful hockey and soccer players. People like Bill Gates. Or the Beatles. What is it that makes people so succesful?    First, it is hard work. To become an expert in a field, one needs at least about 10,000 hours of labor. Like an Asian farmer toiling away on his rice paddy field. The proverbial 99% transpiration that comes with the 1% inspiration.    Second, it is lucky circumstances. Sheer luck. Like being born at the beginning of the year instead of at the end (which makes a surprisingly significant difference in your chances of becoming a top hockey player). Or the country you're from. Or the language you've been raised in (English gives you an early math disadvantage of about a year compared to Chinese or Japanese).    In his previous bestseller [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], Gladwell shows that small initial differences can make for a huge end effect on a society. Also his [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] was about conclusions we all draw from small differences in quick thought processes. In the same way, this book shows how sometimes incredibly small differences can tip somebody towards extreme success.    Small differences also made for the success of Malcolm Gladwell himself. One of the most precious gifts he allegedly got from his father is the memory of \\"seeing him work at his desk and realizing that he was happy\\". The same joyous work ethic oozes from the pages of this book.    Gladwell reads like a detective. He brings you science like a professional storyteller. The science, on the other hand, sometimes suffers a bit from this high readability (some conclusions about cultural causes are quite debatable). There are no footnotes in this book, but in the back of the publication, each chapter does have a number of notes to back up some of his claims.    This book is definitely an entertaining read. It is also a good way to weapon yourself against the abundance of success stories that sound a tad too good to be a full version of the truth.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I just LOVE LOVE this CD! It's simply great infectious pop perfection that will have you playing these songs over and over again (that is, of course, if you like this type of music).<br /><br />Lady Gaga's music is reminiscent of older Madonna/ABBA/Gwen Stefani, but with her own electronic/techno spin. Honestly, this is the CD that Madonna wishes she made instead of the mediocre \\"Hard Candy\\" (I'm a big Madonna fan, just not a fan of her last CD). I would have bought Lady Gaga's album for the song 'Poker Face' alone, which is AMAZING, but the rest of it turned out to be equally great. Although the album is definitely dance/pop music, I think Lady Gaga also shows her versatility - she can sing with the best of them, she can rap, and she either wrote or co-wrote every song on the album. Whether you want to dance, work-out, groove in your car, or just hear some uplifting music, you can't go wrong with \\"The Fame\\".
6305232660|5.0|I feel as if I may have watched a different movie, or at least a different cut, from what some other Amazon Reviewers watched. With the exception of Robert Duvall driving his ship into the tail of the comet a la Bo and Luke Duke - and some unnecessary orchestration to support some mawkish personal stories, this film holds up very well as Science Fiction, with a great story, great characters, and y tastefully programmed action - there is absolutely no violence in any scene: through intelligent editing, we watch the tidal wave from a distance.<br />Morgan Freeman as The President is superb; so is Robert Duvall, as the \\"Old-Timer\\" who has a bit of a struggle unifying his team of astronauts, who want their *own* glory. Tea Leoni is perfect as the aggressive Cable News Anchor. Her reaction is memorable when her Boss admonishes her not to withhold a story from him - little did he know.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|She's so talented, and this recording quietly explores some different themes, religion, war etc, but not angrily.  She is so interesting to listen to, and I really like this disc.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|I do not usually write reviews of movies but this time I had to because this film masterpiece is one of my all time favorites because everything about it is top notch.  I was virtually taken back in time by the realism of the film.  While the acting by all the major characters was fantastic; and the cinematography that so beautifully captured that time in history; the surround sound recording of the creaks and groans of an old ship, the sound of swords clashing, the bang of canons along with such realistic sounds of a storm at sea; all contributed to making this film a rare work of art.  Those who wrote reviews saying that this film was boring either had AADD or were expecting some super-hero movie.  I believe they should try to watch this film one more time and pay attention.  I cannot help but believe they will come away with a much better experience.
B000P0I4O4|1.0|I like Morgan Freeman.  He's an exceptional actor.  I like him so much that I've never seen a movie that he was in that I didn't like.  I tried to like this movie; I tried to find something redeeming in it, anything at all, but it's a zero.  It's filled with guns that come from nowhere, magical shooting ability from a high school teacher/baseball coach who somehow is able to control a Steyr AUG on full auto with no former training, a helicopter crash in the woods that no only doesn't get anyone killed, but the occupants suffer not a single scratch, and hundreds of other mishaps that should not be overlooked by a director with the movie making skill of your average high school student.  It has absolutely no suspense, no surprise ending (it's simply random), and very little action, basically there's nothing to like about this movie.  It does have two good points.  First, it's only an hour and half long, so you won't waste too much time.  Second, if you look in the special features section you'll find previews to a couple of movies that look pretty good.  If you've got to see it borrow it, it's not even worth renting.

B000W91RUG|4.0|The series itself is topnotch which is why I give it 4 stars but the box set is limited with additional stuff.  Don't expect to buy this set and get all kinds of additional features, it's mainly just the episodes.  Very funny series though.
B000002MUQ|5.0|With \\"Balance,\\" Van Halen Mark 2 demonstrated real refinement along with their superb singing and playing skills.  Songs like \\"Amersterdam\\" and \\"Big Fat Money\\" recalled the hyperdrive of [[ASIN:B00004Y6O9 Van Halen]] or of Sammy Hagar's solo hits like \\"I Don't Need Love\\" and \\"I've Done Everything for You.\\"  Every element of hard-rock excellence --  the best guitarist in rock history, a fabulous singer, signature drumming recognizable on first listen through a dorm neighbor's door as that of Alex Van Halen, and vocal harmonies otherwise unknown to hard rock -- is on display here.<br /><br />Yet, as Eddie Van Halen said at the time, he had subordinated flash to the songs.  \\"I Can't Stop Lovin' You,\\" which we had the dj play at my wedding reception, succeeds admirably in laying out the feeling of really being in love.  \\"Take Me Back (Deja Vu)\\" conveys the sentiment of seeing a long-lost amour and feeling that old feeling stir; besides, it features the most memorable guitar line on \\"Balance,\\" and perhaps the finest craftsmanship of any Van Halen tune.<br /><br />In \\"The Seventh Seal,\\" Sammy Hagar's lyrics pick up on a Christian theme he touched on on [[ASIN:B000002LEM OU812]], that of seeking truth and beginning to find it; as on that earlier album, Hagar demonstrates some openness toward other cultures' faiths, but his chief references are Christian.  (The Seventh Seal is mentioned in the Book of Revelation, and the moment when it is \\"cracked,\\" as he puts it here, isn't one we want to witness.  Spine-tingling!)<br /><br />The heaviness of \\"Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do\\" may reflect the musical ambiance of the mid-'90s.  Van Halen was the most popular American band of '78-'91, but that didn't mean that they weren't influenced by others.  For my money, the results are positive.<br /><br />Although I saw VH from the front row of the Frank Erwin Center in Austin in 1982 (Eddie gawked at me mid-\\"Eruption\\" and I caught a Michael Anthony pick) and from the tenth row in 1983, I didn't hear this entire disc front to back 'til last year.  I regret that I missed it, because it is really something.<br /><br />I see that \\"Foghat:  Live\\" merits an average rating of 4.5.  How ridiculous that this truly classic specimen of hard rock gets only a 4.0, then.  Reviewers should remember that they aren't comparing Van Halen CDs to earlier Van Halen CDs, but are comparing them to other music in general.  The boys deserve a flat 5.front to back 'til last year.  I regret that I missed it, because it is really something.    I see that \\"Foghat:  Live\\" merits an average rating of 4.5.

The BD Live feature is also very cool - you do need to have a BD Live enabled player to enjoy this feature.

Now I've got to go get the Dark Knight Blu ray edition!

B001AQO3WY|5.0|In Generation Kill, David Simon and Ed Burns (creators of HBO's Critically Acclaimed series, \\"The Wire\\") give us highly realistic portrayal of the invasion of Iraq and the trial and tribulations experienced by the Marines who led the charge. The events here were orignally reported in the book of the same title by Evan Wright, an embedded Rolling Stone reporter sent to document the first days of the invasion.     Though it is now clear that the military incursion into Iraq was \\"bungled\\" by our defense, military and political leaders, in Generation Kill, we see how much of an effect it had on the soldiers sent to lead the charge. They went in without armor for the turrets on their Humvees, without enough batteries to keep their night vision goggles powered, without a clear plan as to what exactly they were going to be doing. Further, the political in fighting and occasional incompetency among the marine leadership on the ground in Iraq simply creates more confusion and chaos for the soldiers of this unit to contend with.     I can only hope that Generation Kill (both the book and the mini-series) serve for years to come as a realistic document of the Iraq war and a reminder that when sending our military in to foreign battles, we equip them with not only the supplies they need, but the forethought and planning that is necessary to keep them safe and make their operations run smoothly.     I recommend this to anyone with any interest in the Iraq war, regardless of wether or not they support it.  They only way we can prevent the arbitrary use of our military in foreign conflicts in the future is to keep the American public informed about what happens.  Generation Kill is a first hand look at the situation in Iraq, and much credit should be given to HBO, David Simon, Ed Burns, Evan Wight and the marines whom this miniseries is about, for bringing it to life and showing us, from the comfort of our living rooms, what is was like to be there.
B001H9MWW2|5.0|It's Cd of the year for a reason...it's darn catchy and well done.  U2 called by the way, they want their record back!  Hahahahaaa!!!  OK, kidding.  Disc 2 is worth a listen, but the meat and potatoes is on disc #1.  The downfall is the rapping over \\"Lost\\" on CD #2 as others have mentioned.....sorry!  No good!  They ruined this track.  Don't try to be all things to all people.  Coldplay is not ghetto.  It's the only track you must skip over completely because its a great song that was destroyed by urbanizing it.  Other than that, please do buy it!

B0000844MP|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, and the Superbit edition's enhanced picture and sound made this a real treat. Although very dramatic, the film paints a portrait of a family inadvertently torn apart by love, family tragedy and a lack of repentence. The entire cast is at its finest, and even Brad Pitt whom I don't consider one of the best actors, shines in this story and cast.<br /><br />The dialogue and the unraveling of this story is often heart breaking and immensely sad, given a set of impossible circumstances. Everyone loses in this film, but it truly is one of the films where if you let yourself accept this, it is a revelation. A beautiful score compliments this film, and rouses emotion through. It's a fanstastic combination of atmosphere (emotional and visual), scenary, and tragedy at every level.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Replaced my old VHS tape with the DVD.  It's a must have for Xmas movies!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|The first single of the album - Gotta Be Somebody - does not exemplify the overall feel of the album. It's good - don't get me wrong - but you won't find as many scrubbed pop-rock songs on this album as you might find on previous albums. However, a very good change of pace - more hard rock. I like it.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|From her style and her music sound, there is no mistaking Enya for anyone else.  Her compositions, arrangements and orchestrations are fresh, and innovative without going to radical extremes.  Of course, she loves to play with new recording techniques and synthesizers but it all blends together with her sound.  Everything she does in this album/CD WORKS! All the songs are melodic and they have a beat.  They show different moods and textures of the Holiday season. Some are reverent like \\"The Journey Of The Angels\\" to the sentimental and wishful \\"Dreams Are More Precious\\", \\"The Spirit Of Christmas Past\\" to the playful \\"One Toy Soldier\\" to the ryhtematic \\"My! My! How Time Flies!\\" Her recording of \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" and \\"O&iacute;che Chi&uacute;in (Chorale)\\" (\\"Silent Night\\" in a language that is not English or the orginnal German) are one of the best I ever heard. I know the record company is hyping \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" and \\"White Is In The Night\\" but they are not clearly the best on this album. Take that last line as an indication of how good this album is if you happen to like those songs - aka: the rest of the album is as good or is better than those two.

B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Well, I've seen it, and honestly, it's good, but it's not as great as I heard.  There are great performances, notably the sadly late Heath Ledger's performance as the joker.  It is extremely memorable, and lives up to its hype.  Ledger doesn't copy Nicholson's campy, silly performance in the original movie.  He completely goes the opposite way, and creates an extremely creepy and quite unsettling character.  He really steals the film, and it's sad to watch because he died of a stupid drug overdose, and this is his last major work.  Oldman is quite subdued (and excellent) as the commissioner, Bale is good as Batman, Eckhart is good as Two-Face/the DA, Michael Caine brings dignity to the role of Alfred, and Maggie Glynenthal is good as well.  Morgan Freeman, as great as he is, is really wasted here.  His character is completely superfluous.<br /><br />There is some great dialogue, but there's also a lot of awful dialogue.  I know it's a comic book movie, but if you try and apply any real logic to this film, it falls apart.  We never see the Joker set up any of his elaborate schemes, and considering he's a completely pyschopath and enjoys killing people at random, who would really want to work for the man?  The Joker's schemes are so outlandish that you can't believe them for a second.  How does the Joker manage to convince so many people to work for him?  Does he have that much pull?  Does the mob have all that pull?  It's probably best not to think about it all.  The film is meant to operate on a visceral level, methinks.  I haven't read the original comic books, but perhaps I should.  Maybe they made more sense.  The action scenes are, for the most part, perfunctory.  They don't have any real drive or creativity.  In fact, they're rather dull, surprisingly.<br /><br />The film runs 2 1/2 hours, and it should have been trimmed a bit, perhaps to two 1/4 hours.  There's quite a lot of boring, expository dialogue here, and overall the film feels lengthy.  However, the climax is excellent, surprising, and a good conclusion to the film.  So, overall, it's worth seeing, but it's a very mixed bag.  It doesn't live up to its hype, but it's still worth checking out, especially for Ledger's excellent performance.excellent, surprising, and a good conclusion to the film.

The only complaint that I have with this season is that it has no encounters with the cybermen of previous seasons, however it is said at the end of the season they will be making a return.  So overall, the seasong is awsome and is another great addition to the Dr. Who series.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|A friend of mine who grew up in China strongly recommended this movie to me. He knew my fondness for martial arts movies, especially kung fu movies. He said they got a lot of things right. The villian even had a decidedly Japanese name. I was busy at the time, but stored the name away for a potential rental on a subzero day in the upcoming winter. I watched it last night. The movie was very good.    Jack Black as the Panda was excellant. Hoffman as the master was very good. The animation was good enough. The starting dream sequence imitated the \\"Samurai Jack\\" style of animation and was hilarious. The humor drove the movie. I'm not a philosopher, but the lessons of the movie were basically the westernized, simplified Zen teachings you get now days. It is basically the same lesson as the \\"The Last Dragon,\\" but this movie is far better. The fight scenes using animals were creative. The villian was evil and scary.     What made me appreciate the movie is that it made my wife laugh. She never understood my predilection for martial art movies and approached this movie with a little trepidation, but she was laughing throughout. In other words, this is a very funny movie.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|How can Jamal Malik, a poor boy from the slums of Mumbai, be one answer away from the grand prize on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  This is the question that launches Danny Boyle's tenderly sublime Slumdog Millionaire, 2008's best chance at a film that will both earn the respect of critics and satisfy audiences (well, other than that little movie about a billionaire moonlighting as a crime-fighter).      The film begins just as Jamal's first episode on Millionaire has ended, when the sounding alarm prevents India's version of Regis from asking the final question.  Because of Jamal's lowly socio-economic status, the producers and authorities believe him to be a cheat and begin a Guantanamo-like search for answers.  After some brutal torture tactics (yes, brutal) do not achieve the desired results, Jamal is able to plead his innocence by explaining how he knew the answers to the questions.    Each answer comes with a vignette from his young life, and those scenes make up the majority of the film.  In the accompanying story to his answer about a poet, we learn of a time when he sang poems as a street beggar and in his answer to \\"who invented the revolver\\", we hear about the time he saw a gun fired.  Something almost supernatural seems to be at play, as it appears that someone followed Jamal through his life and selected questions relating to moments forever burned into his memory.    An ever-present theme to his stories is his desire to reconnect with a girl from his youth.  Like Estella to Pip or Jenny to Forrest, Jamal's Latika is a girl who first stumbled into his life at a young age and has lived in his dreams ever since.  Even in the most dire circumstances and seemingly unlivable conditions, Jamal is able to survive in part because of his memories of Latika and his need to find her, to rescue her, and to care for her.    Equal parts David Copperfield and Artful Dodger, Jamal is always shown to be clever, resilient and slippery.  For a film that's sure to inspire audiences with its sweet, enchanting core, we're also given a look at the horrors of poverty, the absurdity of religious warring and the gloomy life of orphans.  It's impossible to not think of the kids like Jamal and Latika who aren't able to escape the slums, but that's a story for another day.  The one we're given is a refreshing mixture of romance, adventure and coming of age poignancy, all wrapped up in an immediately identifiable piece of pop culture.       What's the most emotionally satisfying film experience this year?  \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".  Final answer.
0735204314|4.0|I've read almost two thirds of book.  It is very interesting and reinforces the concept of a greatly improved life through the art of positive thinking.  The book is repetitive, which is good for people like me.  It's almost as if the author wants one to ingest the idea firmly into ones mind through osmosis.  It concerns me a little that, although the bible is quoted often, one gets the feeling that if life can be controlled by the subconscious mind, why do we need to pray?  Definitely a helpful book but one needs to keep a sense of balance between man and God.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is  an incredible first novel by Lisa Genova.   Alice, a harvard professor, wife and mother  is diagnosed with early onset alzheimers at age 50.  Alice and her family are left reeling at her diagnosis, and how rapidly each day brings her more bewildering physical and emotional symptoms.  Her husband, college professor as well, doesn't know how to cope with her disease, and the woman who is Alice, but not Alice.  All three children are affected  as they cope with the possibility of getting alzheimers themselves, and taking care of this \\"new\\" mom.   My mom was diagnosed with early onset, but for the first time I was able, through Alice,  to understand exactly what she went through.  I certainly understand what the daughters felt.  At times I thought I was reading a memoir, because Lisa completely captures an early alzheimers patient  thought process.  I could not put Still Alice down and highly recommend this wonderful and powerful book.

He led me throught stories of success that were so interesting I lost hours of sleep each day as I had to find out the details of each story before I could retire.    As a teacher it reinvigorated me and reinforced my belief that each and every individual, given the right resources, can be encouraged to reach a much higher potential than often is thought.    If every school district official and every politician were to read this book it would change the way we spend money in our educational programs!    This is a must read for everyone interested in creating or reaching success.

0743298039|5.0|Setterfield's novel grabbed me from the first page.  This is a book for book lovers.  The main character is a young woman who works in her Father's antiquarian book shop; she is hired to write the biography of a famous authoress who is notorious for giving a different   \\"life story\\" to anyone seeking to write her bio.  This book kept me up at night until I finished it. Great sub-plots. Can't wait to read more of Setterfield's  literary creations.

B000EGCITG|5.0|....derned if I know why. She isn't my usual style, but Style is one thing she sure has. Maybe that's what I like...she isn't afraid to be strong, and \\"out there\\". Nothing subtle about Pink. Though, when she does turn wistful, she can be haunting. She's pretty, in a rough sort of way, and she has a fantastic voice...you can understand every word; here, that will be a problem for some, as the \\"explicit\\" warning means it.<br /><br />Cynical. That's the word I'm thinking. The recent \\"Funhouse\\" came out of Pink's rather public divorce...this apparently emerged from her private pain as things were going to hell...her mind was messed-up, and this album is the result. Sad for her. Happy for fans of great music.<br /><br />No sex discrimination here: \\"Stupid Girls\\" sometimes are, and make really dumb choices [was Alecea looking in a mirror?]. \\"U + Ur Hand\\"...yeah, sometimes jerk guys get what they deserve. \\"'Cuz I Can\\"...an ode to self indulgence, to hell with you. \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\"...conflicted self indulgence. I don't need you. Do I?? \\"I've Got Money Now\\"...purely cynical about the world. I don't need you. Really. \\"Conversations With My Thirteen Year Old Self\\"....she'd like to talk to the little girl she used to be, maybe keep her from making stupid mistakes, but she can't. Wistful, indeed.<br /><br />I could have done without the liberal bilge of \\"Dear Mr. President\\"...it is the President's job to protect us from foreign enemies, not to fix everything...he's supposed to stay out of our way so we can fix it. HOWEVER, for the last [unlisted] track, I forgive her...\\"I Have Seen The Rain\\", a duet with her Dad, Jimmy, of a song written by him. Mr. Moore [the obvious source of Pink's talent] and little Alecea used to sing it at gatherings of his fellow Viet Nam Vets. Wonderful...she dedicates it to the Vets in a spoken intro. Attack the President if you wish, but honor the Vet. Right balance. Good Girl.<br /><br />I really like Pink, and this record. Not for really young kids, unless you want them picking up words they'll use all-too-soon, anyway. The girl has a tough class and style that is engaging. And a great voice. As usual, fine production and art work, though there is a bikini shot in the booklet that I should have liked to see on the cover. All in all, six stars.

B00004NHCC|4.0|Don't get me wrong: This review might sound a little negative, but really, it's all good. Sarah sings wonderfully, Clifford plays amazingly, and there isn't a bad track on this CD. For me, I just find Sarah a little too operatic - or call it elegant - in her singing, and after a while, I just grow tired of that constant husky vibrato. True, she tries to mix it up a little, and her scatting is amazing, but when I listen to it a second time after listening to all the other tracks on the CD, it just sounds too contrived. For me, the real highpoint of this recording is Clifford Brown's work. He just makes every singer better. The rest of the backing band is solid, and the recording is clean. So call it picking nits, if you want, because this is a great jazz recording - historic almost - but I like some other recordings similar to this a lot better. (If you like Clifford Brown and are a fan of female vocal jazz, you definitely should check out Helen Merrill's [[ASIN:B000786JPU Complete Recordings]].)
1416955070|4.0|I found this book in the bookstore the other day and thought it seemed very interesting, definitely a book I would enjoy.  I was right, to a certain extent.  When I started reading the book I could not put it down, I was up all night reading it.  But as I got to the end of the book, things started falling apart for me.  I do not like the fact the Jace and Clary ended up being brother and sister, especially since they were falling in love, I felt the stirrings of their love while reading, and it was so good!  I knew before I got to the end that my hopes were going to be shattered, but I was still hoping the author would throw another plot twist in, but that was not the case.  That is really the only reason this book did not get a 5 star.  I will not be getting the 2nd book in the series because I just can't fathom a love interest between Clary and Simon.  So sad...

0618918248|5.0|if you are a faithful/religious person, you're gonna hate the book.  it won't convert you and there is little you can offer to argue with it that hasn't already been said.  just don't bother with it.  you believe what you believe and nothing will probably ever change that, just as no atheist will ever become a believer.<br /><br />if you're an atheist like me, tired of being a minority that can't voice an opinion without someone rolling their eyes at you, it feels great to read something like this.  he reinforced many of the ideas i already have and gave me some new ways to look at the subject.  what i liked most is finally somebody clarified that you can still be an atheist and think that the world and existence was triggered by 'something'...i get so sick of religious people trying to argue that i actually believe in God because i don't think it all came from 'nothing' and that everything means nothing...that's nihilist, not atheist.  there's alot more to the definition of God than 'anything that explains our existence.'  dawkins defends einstein and others who acknowledge some greater force but one that does not carry all of the nonsense in the current definition of 'God.'...he also lists out the different levels of atheism in detail, points out the contradiction in thinking morals actually come from scripture, comes up with alternatives to the ten commandments...this book has it all.<br /><br />anyways, i won't babble to much.  just know it is well-written, well-argued, and well-thought-out.  if you're an atheist or agnostic, it's a must-read.  everyone else, just leave it alone and let us have a book for us.  you have your books.
B00008OLYN|5.0|What an AMAZING band. An INCREDIBLE piece of music. With Opeth, you HAVE to appreciate there musicianship. Akerfeldt is a musical genius. It's as if we are wandering in his head bouncing from the left side of his brain to the other side. Lopez, well, what can be said about him. Folks think that just because you can pound and hammer out music on the drumkit with ferosity as he does, that this guy is limited in his playing. Since he left Opeth, I hope he's still practicing and playing and will have some new music out soon! Peter, I'm sure will get work. His guitaring is masterful at worst and really complimented the band and vice versa. Mendez' fingers barely touched the strings of his bass and when it did, such gentleness and you can actually hear him playng different chords! Per (on keys) haunt the cd so lovely. I think this is his first with the band. I could be wrong (please be kind if I am) but you can tell that he has been classically trianed. Akerfeldt. Well, this guy is genius and you can tell that his sense of music does't travel down that narrow tunnel that soooooo many bands (particularly death metal) are trapped under. This band travels the whole spectrum of good music. Great CD.<br /><br />CHUCKDEEZUL O U T<br />Brooklyn  S T A N D  U P!<br />Cooper Park<br />50 Debevoise Ave

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Great story line!  Excellent Cast!  The series is so well written.  If you enjoy building a library of TV series on DVD, this is a must have.  If you have never seen the show before, it's a \\"gotta see\\", start with season 1 and enjoy.

Fortunately, a friend showed it to me before I opened my copy -- which I returned for a refund. Don't waste your money, it's a bomb.
0740748475|5.0|I grew up reading Calvin & Hobbes in the newspaper every morning, and I bought every C&H book as they came out.  But I found this exhaustively complete (and extremely heavy) compilation to be an absolute must-have.  Every strip is included and printed in the original publication order, along with the dates on which each strip ran.  As an added bonus, Vol. 1 includes a detailed preface by author Bill Watterson, and all three books contain all the original cover artwork and extras from previous collections, such as the poem \\"A Nauseous Nocturne\\" first seen in \\"The Essential Calvin and Hobbes.\\"<br /><br />The books' large size and weight make them a bit too unwieldy for a bedtime read, but don't let their girth or the price prevent you from adding this to your library.
006135323X|5.0|Predictably Irrational is fascinating; Predictably Irrational is informative; and Predictably Irrational is important.  It will raise your awareness of all the cognitive glitches that make us do really stupid things-- even if we are otherwise really smart (or at least think we are...) Its fundamental principles have been discussed in other reviews, so I will hold back from repeating them, but make no mistake, they are worth reading for yourself.  I wish that this book were not only included among standard economic curricula, but standard life curricula as well.  Our current economic mess illustrates all too well the hazards of ignoring our inner idiots; Dr. Ariely's book is the 50-cent aspirin that may just help prevent such future headaches from haunting our futures.   Buy it.  Read it.  Learn from it.  And profit by it.  We may all be a little crazy, but that doesn't mean we need to act like we are.

0143038419|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a lady friend of mine, and soon found myself captivated by Elizabeth Gilbert's story. The book chronicles the most challenging period of her life- from her divorce through a heartening odyssey of self discovery. When she stops trying to fix herself and adopts a strategy of going for her life full out, she discovers the peace and satisfaction that had eluded her for so long. Really inspirational! If your life is in transition, you'll find this a great read.    If this kind of transformational thinking clicks with you, you should read  [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]], by Ariel and Shya Kane. This powerful little book is a reliable short-cut to enlightenment, with loads of common sense that cuts through the psychological mumbo-jumbo I find in so many books in this genre. The Kanes prove that being present is the key to seeing your life change in an instant. One of the most down-to-earth and helpful books I've read in years.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is one of those epic imaginative films that weaves magical storytelling and moral mortal magical gravitas together with unmatched aplomb. The story itself is as old as the ages  - light versus darkness. The light is beautifully evinced by 'star' whose heart and attendent magical properties are lusted after by the dark trio of evil witch sisters eager for the elixir of eternal youth and outer beauty. The evil dying King has similarly evil sons, three of whom have already departed this life for the next as victims of brotherly greed and lust for money and power. The three remaining sons each try to murder the other and claim the crown for their own evil treacherous ends. As Tristan and the Star are drawn together in an epic journey where each one learns the true meaning and value of love, they are able to overcome all obstacles placed in their paths by the money grabbing treacherous Princes and the evil witches lusting after external youth and beauty. Ultimately Tristan learns that a superficial and demanding love is no love at all, and united with the Star he is able to find love, happiness, material wealth and be able to be a charitable and kindly King to all.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I recently was looking up films that Christian Bale starred in when I bumped into this gem. I never heard anything about this film but after watching it I say it deserves the praise that it gets on here and then some.<br /><br />Trevor Reznik is a factory worker whose life goes completely awry after he meets a mysterious stranger named Ivan(John Sharian) that claims to work in the same factory. Things get worse for Trevor as one his co-workers loses an arm(Miller played by Micheal Ironside) and he is questioned about the incident. Trevor believes he is going insane and constantly visits a hooker and a airport restaurant waitress in attempts to regain his sanity. He hasn't been sleeping well and things get more complicated for him once Ivan is introduced into his life.<br /><br />Christian Bale gives one hell of a performance as the tortured soul Trevor Reznik. Jennifer Jason Leigh as well as Michael Ironside turn in some good performances. Christian Bale looks ghastly and sickly but his point of shedding 63 pounds to play this role was well made. I also like the score for this movie. Its no overbearing and grating: Its haunting and eerie and complements the overall tone to this intriguing and well-written mystery. So if you are in the mood for a great psychological thriller you couldn't go wrong with The Machinist.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|In contrast to the previous HULK movie, this one is done alot better and justifies with the character much better.    Bly-Ray adds a whole new experience to the incredible movie.

031606792X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Like others I was worried even before I read the first book that I wouldn't like the saga because of all the negative reviews I had read. The one thing you have to keep in mind is that this is fantasy. It is a romance and fantasy combined and expecting it to be an instant classic or give complex views/answers about life isn't fair. These books are great from an entertainment standpoint. Come on, how many of us wish that we  could find a true love willing to give up everything and risk it all just to be in our lives?     As for Breaking Dawn specifically: This book was full of unexpected twists to the plot that I really enjoyed. The action moved along at a fast pace and was satisfying in the end. I loved how they all got their happy endings; call it gratification if you want, but I would have very disappointed, not to mention let down, if the saga had ended in tragedy. I also love how Meyer didn't feel the need to include profanity and graphic sex scenes to 'enhance' the story, like so many other authors do. The fact that the main characters wait until after marriage to finally make love is very sweet and, in my opinion, how it should be. The story was powerful enough without including the details about the sex scenes. Another post I read said that Meyer mentioned that every secretion from a vampire is venomous, even the tears, and that was a reason that Bella and Edward would not have been able to have sex in the first place; where did she say that? I don't recall that in any of the books and plus, it was said that vampires couldn't cry anyway. Sorry to get off track; loved the story and all of the weird twists.    The only things I would have wanted to go differently: the showdown with the Volturi and Edward's reaction toward Renesmee. I was surprised when Edward immediately was against the baby from the beginning. Bella had surpassed everyone's expectations already so why couldn't she have been different with pregnancy too? I really feel that it would have gone better to have Bella and Edward sit down and discuss the pregnancy rationally instead of have Bella call Rosalie, of all people, to help her go against Edward. Also, in my opinion, Rosalie could not have so controlled the situation as portrayed in the book (as Bella's 'bodyguard'; Edward could so have taken her if he wanted). It was also not necessary for Edward to try to get Jacob to convince Bella to have sex with him in order to get a child: hello, Bella only loves and wants THIS baby because it's Edward's; she never would have wanted another person's baby anyway, but maybe that was meant to express how truly desperate and crazed Edward had become in his worry for Bella, to willingly agree for her to be involved that way with another man.  The ending with the Volturi was also a bit of a disappointment. I was so excited and involved with the preparations for the fight it was almost a let down when nothing happened. I was beyond happy to find out that Bella had her own special ability after all and really think that everyone would be happier with the book if the Cullens and their allies had destroyed the Volturi once and for all; there was clear evidence that they were corrupt anyway and would have killed or tried to control everyone they could get their hands on. There really needed to be a knock-down, drag-out battle to round things off; it would have been infinitely more satisfying, especially since the Cullens' side had the upper hand.  After all that, I just want to finish by saying that I was not disappointed with the ending, just wanted a little more before the happily ever after. I loved all the books and would recommend them to anyone who is up for some great romantic tension and some great plot twists.    The last thing I want to address is Jacob's imprinting with the baby. It was clearly explained in earlier books what exactly imprinting was and that it was not a voluntary process. Also, we got to see another of Jacob's friendsimprint with a toddler and witness their interactions, which were clearly not sexual in any manner. I think that to say that this is pedophilia is disgusting. Meyer makes it clear that Jacob's feelings for Renesmee are not sexual at all, even if they might change when she becomes older. And really, the only problem I think people are having is that Jacob is imprinting now instead of when Renesmee is older; then there would not probably be anything said about the age difference between them. I thought the idea of imprinting was actually kind of fascinating, although it obviously could cause big emotional problems (like with Sam and Leah). That's all I've got to say. Happy reading and Merry Christmas!
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Good movie. Bad disc. I did not get this at Amazon. The dvd comes in an all cardboard case without a raised center to stabilize the disc. The disc case is very difficult to open/close because it's such a tight fit.  The disc is scratch prone with normal use, and rarely plays properly. Disney went all cheap-o with this dvd.   Now what am I supposed to do? Wait to see if Disney fixes the problem and hope I'm informed of it? Take a chance and buy another copy?  I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this disc. Maybe it's just a way to promote Blu-ray's 'quality'.  (At least Casino Royale plays if I put in the 2nd disc first and then the movie disc.)  Over 10 years of dvd's and this is the first with such a scratch/play problem.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|This heartrending story of an orphan who gets within a question from winning 22 Million Rupees on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" is simply one of 2008's best films. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an 18 year-old orphan, has lived the hard-knock life, so that when he gets to each question posed by the slimy narcissistic host (Anil Kappor), there was some tragedy in his life to illuminate the answer.<br /><br />\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" highlights the cavernous divide between India's nouveau riche and it's impoverished. As Jamal and his orphaned brother start out, they are driven from the slums by a murderous religious riot (where the cops act annoyed as a flaming body races by screaming), the find themselves in a nightmare Orphan camp, pimped out by a deadly keeper, caught inside the web of an Indian Mobster's empire, and then Jamal finally incarcerated by sadistic law enforcement. He's a mere question from beating the game, yet no-one wants to admit that this \\"slumdog\\" could know so much.<br /><br />The difference between knowledge and experience is what drives \\"Slumdog Millionaire,\\" and what drives Jamal is his love for Lakita (the stunning beauty, Freida Pinto). Even as his brother and he grow apart, Jamal can't stop pursuing his dream, and like all the good fairy-tales, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" has both a Prince and Princess. This is a movie that will hold you to the edge of your seat, laughing, flinching, cheering and rooting for the hero even as he sits in the glare of the gameshow spotlights. Along with [[ASIN:B001FB55JY Milk]], one of the best dramas you'll see this season.

In order for it to be seen that week, I just went out and bought the single disc version at walmart while they were on sale.  The two bonus discs worked ok.
B001AHM2C6|5.0|I chose to get the limited edition of The Dark Knight soundtrack and it is certainly a worthy addition to my collection of Hans Zimmer film score recordings.  If I were to describe this recording with one word, it would have to be \\"suspense\\", as each theme brings you right to the edge of your seat, waiting to hear what comes next, especially during the very first track, which is aptly called, \\"Why So Serious?\\"  Unlike previous works by Zimmer, The Dark Knight explores thematic development, sometimes with just using one note drawn out with the use of signal processing, detuning, and other elements of tension which eventually develop into more rhythmic structures or the typical \\"Zimmer pulse\\" which are trademark elements of his compositions for Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, Gladiator and Crimson Tide.  However, in each movie, Zimmer masterfully weaves a predominant motif in the style and flavor of each film.  In Crimson Tide, the oscillation of the submarine's sonar became an echo within the score.  In Gladiator, the mechanics and timing of the Roman Legion resounded as a musical countdown to the unleashing of hell.  And in Pirates, the main theme became a montage mimicking the rocking of a pirate's ship at sea.<br /><br />For Dark Knight, this is certainly a dark movie with explosive twists and turns throughout, but the main characters have their own dark secret personalities which Zimmer captures in an ambient way.  After watching the movie, I listened to the soundtrack with great enthusiam, and then went back to the movie again with focus on the deployment of these themes, whether in part or as a whole.  Sometimes, you miss these details when you are first watching a film of this sort because your focus leans towards the visual, and somewhat less as to the background soundtrack.  But I suggest getting this soundtrack and enjoying it on its own, then go back and see the film again.  It will simply astonish all of your senses.  I also was amazed at Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker, but that's another story.ance as The Joker, but that's another story.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|I just wanted to make a comment on the excellent and fast service of Amazon. I am impressed that a company of this size, and at this time of the year(holidays) that your service is so great! Thank You! DJohnson
B00005JLIU|3.0|I purchased \\"Throughly Modern Millie\\" an enjoy the DVD. It is entertaining and funny. It is the first time to purchase for this comany, but I found it to be easy and delivery was in a fashionable lenght of time. Would recommend this company to all.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Bought this for my niece and WE love it!  If you loved the original Hairspray, you'll definitely love this remake.  The cast is cute, fun to watch.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|The product was sent on time and in wonderful condition, there was a delay with the product due to mail theft, however a prompt email was sent to inform the situation by the seller and a replacement product was sent ASAP. Would buy from this seller again!!!
0790729369|5.0|I have been trying to find the DVD in full screen for some time. It is the romantic classic of the 90's.
0312370849|4.0|I found this to be a compelling read and was moved most by Sarah's narrative.  This book took me to France, July 16, 1942 -- a dark place.  I found that I could not read too much at one sitting.  Sarah's story gripped my heart.  The reader learns that 76,000 Jewish people were deported from France....to their death.  Julia's narrative, at first, was compelling, as well.  However, as her story unfolds, for me, it becomes a bit too much.  I would have preferred a different search -- a search for surviving french police guards who were part of this round-up and deportation of innocent people. Additionally, this would have been a 5 star had the author concentrated more on Sarah, her journey here, her life here, here demons. Some portions of this book are important -- especially for people who want/need some education on man's inhumanity, indifference and intolerance.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is one of those CD's that I like from beginning to end. There are songs that stand out more than others; Closer, Sex on Fire, and Be Somebody for example. The fuzzy bass riff that dominates Crawl makes it one of my personal fav's. I'm hopeful that these guys stay in it for the long haul and that we can expect many more fantastic CD's.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|The wait was worth it - more technology available makes this one even more action packed than the ones that have gone before.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn ended the Bella and Edward Saga exactly the way most serious relationships endup....Married with Children.  I loved Breaking Dawn just as much as I loved Twilight.  I'm sure most giddy Preteens will hate this novel but anyone who has found love and taken that relationship to marriage will love it too.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Daniel Craig returns for his second outing as James Bond 007 in the epic action/adventure \\"Quantum of Solace.\\" Continuing the events from the best film in the series, \\"Casino Royale,\\" \\"Quantum\\" has bond chasing down the people behind the death of Vesper, and stumbles on a secret organization codenamed Quantum, a group that's so secret, even MI-6 isn't aware of their existence. Bond ends up tangling with a member of the organization who's bent to take over the water supply of Third World countries. Teaming up with a vengeful Russian, Bond takes on the enemy with the brute force that leaves many dead in its wake, leaving Bond's superiors to wonder if his mission is one of vengeance, and not duty.<br />\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is not as good as the previous entry, but still proves to be an exciting film. Craig once again proves that he is the definitive Bond, a man who's both charming and brutal. The top notch supporting cast and fine writing also deliver. The film's main weakness are the action sequences. While they are very exciting, the editing is very choppy, and leaves the viewer confused about what is going on until the very end. The story also jumps from one country to another one too many times. At 106 minutes, the film crams almost too much into it's short running time. Still, the film delivers the goods, and Bond fans will find much to appreciate.<br />Movie Grade: B+
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I never got a chance to see Mama Mia at the movies, nor did I see the Broadway show. I really did not know about the story, except what I saw on TV promoting the movie.   I did purchase the Blue Ray disc, just knowing I would LOVE the movie, and I do (I Do, I Do, I Do...)... in fact, I have seen it twice in two days since it arrived at my house. I am enthralled with the story, the scenery, the actors, (Dominic Cooper is a REAL cutie!!) and the music was a real blast from my past. Who knew ABBA had so many fantastic songs??   So, sit down, turn on the tv, pop in the Blue Ray disc, crank up the surround sound and have a fantastic time... I did !!!!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. All the great reviews pretty much say it all.And the show should speak for itself. But, why then has this not been done on blu-ray????? I'm shocked that it has not been done yet. Let's just keep our fingers crossed.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|I enjoy her music. There is the hit \\"so What\\" but I also enjoy the title track \\"Funhouse\\". Not as good as her last one though.
B000AY74OG|3.0|Actually, the second in this series is better than the first although this one sets the story line.
0393312836|5.0|This has turned out to be one of my favorite books ever.  It's funny how you come to understand the street slang Burgess has made up.  This book was very satifying.  All of my emotions were used while reading this book, from hate, love, disgust, fear, confusion, etc.....
0545128285|2.0|I love the Harry Potter series and yes the stories in this book are quite fun BUT ... it was lacking that magic and Dumbledores commentary was boring and I had to reread it many times just to read what I skipped over from dazing off. I'm sadden to write a disappointing review but I did give it an extra star because I respect the Harry Potter series so much ! Quite fun and not for kids under eight that's for sure !
0385340990|5.0|WONDERFUL, GREAT, FUN, INSITEFUL, WELL WRITTEN, GREAT CONSTRUCTION, GREAT CHARACTERS, GREAT LOCATION DETAILS, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.  IN FACT I WROTE ON THE COVER (NOT THE DUST COVER) AND IN SIDE FRONT AND BACK COVERS \\"RETURN TO OWNER, DO NOT PASS ON\\"  I WILL HAVE TO SAY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ IN YEARS.  I WANT MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR ABOUT THESE PEOPLE, AND SOON !!!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|If you love the Beatles, this is a fun cd that will take you back
B00004STPT|5.0|Some of the most beautiful film music I have ever heard. I listen to it regularly. Stunning orchestral pieces, and some hauntingly beautiful pieces with vocals too. You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD, especially if you also watch the film Gladiator, as the songs will bring to memory the images and emotions of the film.
185984054X|4.0|This little book provides an \\"alternate view\\" of the life and work of Mother Teresa.  The balance it provides should be shared widely among her strongest fans as part of \\"setting the records (factual)\\" straight... that is, if one can remain objective in forming a new position with regards to her life long effort to support fundamentalist, Catholic views.  An easy read!
B000B894AI|4.0|I do not read reviews until I am finished reading any book.  I was astonished to read the last several reviews.  It is ENTERTAINMENT folks, not a book on how to stop global warming.  Why are people so cynical.  It almost sounds like they are wannabes.  Was the ending far fetched, yes, but I still found it entertaining.  Was the main villian plausible, no, not really.  That is one reason I did not give it 5 stars or even 4 1/2 stars.    A presidential candiate is killed during a rally and 8 years later another candiate is kidnapped.  A secret service agent in each case is hung out to dry.  The first one is now retired from the service.  The two agents eventually get together to try to solve the 2 cases.  I enjoyed how the writer made these 2 characters.  The retired one is now a lawyer and the other is an ambitious female, in a man's world, who is also an olympic medalist.    There are quite a few turns of which a vast majority are plausible.  How the two agents get together is fun reading.  It is a book I had a hard time putting down.  Overall, I was not disappointed.
B00129H7VS|5.0|As far as the Bluray goes V.s the dvd version. The bluray is a better copy. But like all movies that were filmed before the HD storm kicked off. It has some parts that are still grainy at times. But there is a big improvement. I do not regret owning this series on both formats. It is an epic tell of courageous men who us Americans and all Europeans owe our lives. They were the Greatest generation thus far. Please thank one of them if you meet them while you still can.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|This is a movie I thought would benefit from being Blu-ray and I was right.  Although most of the older titles are a waste of money to have in Blu-ray this movie is not that old and the images were fantastic.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|An epic action movie, a superbly acted ensemble piece, a dark crime drama, a rumination on the consequences of our choices and actions, and a story about a guy dressing up like a bat, THE DARK KNIGHT is all of these and more. Chris Nolan has created a work that will stand with THE GODFATHER PART 2 and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK as sequels that best their predecessors emotionally and artistically. An astounding achievement that puts all other films based on the characters created in the comics and graphic novels to shame. BRAVO. If you're getting a Blu-ray player for the holidays, this is a must-have title.
0743290119|3.0|This book is hard to get into because it keeps going back explaining things and for me it just ruins a good read especially when you just want to get into a roll....kinda disappointing good story tho but need time to read it
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It's exactly what I expected. The packgage is a bit smaller than it seems but I found that to be a good thing. If you are a true Friends fan like myself you too will be thrilled with your purchase.
0452289963|5.0|This came highly recommended by someone for whom I have a great deal of respect and I've not been able to put it down- it offers clarity.
B000GH3CVQ|3.0|Based on listening to the mp3 download (not the CD), I thought the mix was very odd with those wonderful harmonies often buried beneath the instruments. Otherwise it's a beautiful set of music. I really like these guys.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|Everyone has a favourite: guitarist that it. Mine has always and forever will be Jeff Beck. The most accomplished instrumentalist that few people have heard of. From the earliest days in the Yardbirds, through his first band with Rod Stewart on Vocals, Ronnie Wood on Bass and Mickey Waller on Drums Beck has laid the foundation for virtually every genre of post Beatles rock. This live recording takes early cuts like Beck's Bolero - (written by Beck and Jimmie Page) and which featured a manic Kieth Moon on the original recording and demonstrates in stark relief where and why Beck's talents lay wringing, wrestling, cajoling and seducing guitar sounds that none have ever been able to emulate. Yes many will claim Hendrix was the innovator - but for those in and around the London Clubs of the mid 60's they will have noticed or even remember nights when Hendrix would watch Beck; some have even recalled Beck and he jamming late into the night.   Once Beck had tired of \\"plank-spanking\\" (post Beck, Bogart and Appice), Beck hooked up with George Martin and took on what is now known as Jazz-Rock. Beck plays today fusing jazz, rock and an electro/techo style all his own - and does so with a free rein. Even the Beatles Day in the Life displays a musical understanding which leave most observers breathless - or may be that might be speechless.  This guy is now 64 and is rarely less than astonishing. Guitarists and music lovers alike should listen to this album if only to hear the full vocal range of the electric guitar in the hands of the acknowledged master!
0753513005|3.0|great book!<br /><br />lovely in-flight reading. makes you aware of the possibilities in life and encourages/convinces you to take the entrepreneurial route. i wanted to rate it 4 or 5 stars but amazon doesnt allow me to change it. However, amazon \\"does\\" allow me to change the text of the review. weird.<br /><br />A very detailed account of an average-intelligence, highly successful entrepreneur who did not go to college. Not like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg who dropped out. Branson skipped it entirely!<br /><br />Proves the point that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to make a significant positive impact on the world. Plus its more fun to read than Michael Dell's biography.

0321344758|5.0|This is one of those books that you read and nod your head 'yes'. A few times I said, 'DUH!' while hitting my forehead.    Things that are obvious but not thought of by the people creating the site.    Great thoughts on testing and human factors analysis.    Well worth the money!
B00001U0DP|1.0|Technically speaking, this movie share the same weaknesses of all the other Benigni's production: it's essentially a group of short gags assembled together more or less casually just to reach the proper length of a film.   As far as the content is concerned, most of the positive reviews run something like:  OK, don't seek historical accuracy in this film. This film is not about the holocaust primarily, it's purpose is not to document the holocaust. It is a film about family and the love of a father for his son. It is a film about how to survive in the most horrible conditions imaginable.   It seems to me they fail to grasp that this movie contains his own paradox. Out of a thousand way one can choose to stage \\"the love of a father for his son\\" Benigni picked up, not surprisingly, the holocaust, because he knew it was \\"the most horrible conditions imaginable\\", i.e. it's sooo touching and also the easiest way to get the audience on your side. On the other hand Benigni depicts a sort of watered, hilarious, Hogan heroes type of holocaust that is far from being \\"the most horrible conditions imaginable\\". Why? First because he is inherently a clown and that is the only way he knows to describe the facts of life, second because it would have been impossible to give the smallest bit of credibility to such a character amidst the horror of a real camp situation.   As a result, the film ends up giving no historical accuracy (actually is an insult to historical accuracy), and, much worse, sounding so fake also on the main characters side.  He simply was ready to take advantage of a real historical drama just as a background in order to give weight and gain support to a otherwise very inconsistent plot, script and mediocre acting.
B000006OBQ|5.0|I will be short (just read some other reviews) but why is this superb album not in print and available anymore? what is Warner thinking? Or are they preparing a reissue programm? who can enlighten me?
B00197POXG|4.0|I LOVE Dr. Quinn and was thrilled to find the entire series and movies in one set. I spent nearly and entire month watching the series form top to bottom. I was disappointed though to find several of my DVDs SKIP!!! and it just happened to be my favorite episodes that were interupted. I was sent a second set only yo find DVDs in that set skipped as well! Now I am in the process of going through both sets and swapping out bad disks for the good ones...a pain!  Love the series and concept, just wish quality control was a little bit better. My advice...go through your set and check for bad disks.
0743201140|2.0|You'll go page after page wondering when the content is going to start.  It starts when you log into a site, using the registration number in the book, and take a test. You cannot use the number if it has been used before, which means that -all- the used books offered here are completely worthless.    As far as the idea is concerned, it makes sense to have an outside analysis of what you might be good at, if you suspect that you have some undiscovered talent.    But the book is a hoax, in that it is only the minor part of what it promises, and you'll likely spend your money before you find out that you won't receive the major part.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I think the first CD release is good.  I have enjoyed listening to it over and over.  I am a big David Cook fan, and voted for him on American Idol.  I will say that I would like to hear something a little more edgy come from him, but expect that from his next CD.  As far as this one goes, there are at least three songs on there I can see being hits, and am not at all disappointed.  I think he played it a little safe on this CD, but still delivered some good tunes and a nice sound.
B00171AEKW|5.0|I found this book very interesting for the purpose of understanding Hitler.  It's not light reading but rather its value is in the information and insights it provides.<br /><br />A key time period in Hitler's troubled life was perhaps when he was in the hospital after getting mustard gas in his eyes during WW I.  He found out that Germany had lost the war.  He was devastated after all he had seen and experienced during his four years in the trenches.  He eventually recovered his eye sight but realized he would never be able to paint or draw again.<br /><br />And I think Hitler began to severely resent those who had not experienced those things.<br /><br />It goes on to tell about what Hitler was doing after the war, his involvement with various political parties, etc..<br /><br />From there he started giving speaches in beer halls where fights often broke out with the communists.  People got beat up.  Sometimes they got killed.  It was during those times that Hitler began life long friendships with people like Hess.<br /><br />Eventually Hitler's simmering rage and resentment was focused on three groups:<br /><br />1. the bourgoise<br />2. the Marxists<br />3. the Jews<br /><br />The borders between these groups got sort of blurred in Hitler's mind.  For example he blamed the bourgoise for not fighting against the Marxists, he says Marx was a Jew, etc..<br /><br />In this politically correct world we live in today it is unusual to find someone who so openly hated other people based mainly on race and religion.  He viewed the Jews as unwelcome foreigners in Germany who were defiling the pure Germanic blood by marrying German girls.  The effects of this 'cross breeding' (as he puts it) he felt could only be corrected over hundreds of years through a process of extermination and sterilization.<br /><br />Hitler refers to a document of questionable authenticity called 'The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion' which claims to prove that the Jews have been scheming to take over the world for hundreds of years.  This document is I'm sure a favorite for neo Nazis and many other suspicious people like William Cooper.  Cooper died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies, undoubtedly believing they were agents of the New World Order who had come to arrest him and take him to a secret concentration camp.<br /><br />Not everyone believes this but supposedly the Russians recovered the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun and were able to perform autopsies on them.  They discovered that Hitler was sexually malformed.  I suspect this is true and explains why Hitler never really had any sort of serious or long term relationship with a woman.<br /><br />So there's a sexual frustration component to Hitler's philosophy I think.  He was perhaps projecting his own deepest resentments and fears when he created his 'survival of the fittest' ideology.<br /><br />Interesingly Hitler took a bullet to save one of his officers during WW I.  Years later in Munich one of Hitler's followers took two bullets to save Hitler's life when they tried to overthrow the government and were put into jail.<br /><br />There's a great Twilight Zone episode about the Nazis called \\"He's Alive\\" with Dennis Hopper.  Several other TZ episodes deal with Hitler and that time period including the great \\"Death's Head Revisited\\".<br /><br />This book became the blueprint for a holocaust.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Friends, I can't tell you how disappointed I've been over the last 15 years with the band that started it all for me, Metallica. So after all this time of me figuring these guys were washed up and sold out, they FINALLY release a decent album! It's a progression from the And Justice album, so it's not quite back to the really heavy days of Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets but this is a good record. Rick Rubin is my hero! Welcome back Metallica!
0307454894|3.0|I find love relationships like the one described in this book absolutely strange, self-destructive and unromantic.  The beginning of the book kinda reminded me of Lolita...with one of the partners twice the age of the other.  The one is totally head over heels and the other cold.  However, beyond that I found the reason to why she didn't want to fight for justice in the courtroom ridiculous--because she's illiterate?  Are you serious?  But maybe it was the fact that she was the only one of the defendants who saw her guilt and truly thought that she deserved such a hard sentence.  She worked with the SS and I guess any connections with them was seen as unacceptable.  What I truly liked, though, was how the author dealt with the fact of how Germans feel about the Holocaust and their involvement.  It's been years and some of the next generations think that somehow the guilt passes down to them...even though their parents might not have been supporters of the Nazis.  But just by saying or doing nothing, were they also guilty?  This is a question I've been thinking about for many years, since I'm from Germany myself.  The older generation doesn't like to talk about it...but some of the younger generations now think that they are not responsible for the actions their parents have committed.  What is one to think?  I like that the author addressed this very sensitive issue and brought it to light on behalf of all Germans.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|This movie is starting to get a bit dated now in terms of effects, but it still looks fantastic.  The only down-side to this disc is it needs more bonus material...as do many movies, unfortunately.  Regardless, it is a bargain for your Blu-ray collection and you will not be disappointed in the quality.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|The remastering of the film is great, but for a 25th Anniversary Edition it's a bit lack luster. I've had the movie on VHS forever, so being able to get a remastered version on DVD was fine for me. If you are a bonus feature person, you will be disappointed. Maybe the 30th Anniversary Edition will pack more features.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I consider myself the more casual Fall Out Boy fan as opposed to hardcore fan, despite owning all of Fall Out Boy's albums from FROM UNDER A CORK TREE until 2008's FOLIE A DEUX.  However, I must say that with every successive album, I am becoming a true hardcore fan.  FOLIE A DEUX easily trumps INFINITY ON HIGH, despite the fact that commercially first single \\"I Don't Care\\" didn't chart as high as \\"This Ain't A Scene\\".  Either way, this album features the pop-punk boys actually heightening their style to be more inclusive of other genres of music.  The urban aspect is truly heightened on this album as Patrick Stump goes full-on soul here with runs and all.  The end product provides for one of 2008's most interesting and most engaging listens.  Often, lately especially, it is difficult to find an album that you can listen to all the way through without taking a break.  FOLIE A DEUX is so 'action packed' that it reads like a phenomenal mystery thriller.  That is not to say that some spots are not better than others, but overall, FOLIE A DEUX may be Fall Out Boy's most exciting album. Who would've thought that the boys would have given Panic At The Disco's fine 2008 album PRETTY. ODD. a run for its money?<br /><br />The album opens with the fine \\"Disloyal Order Of Water Buffaloes\\", which finds Stump singing nice, easy, and controlled. Then instantly, the mad guitar riffs and bass riffs transform the number into a mega punk-pop anthem.  Stump sounds top-rate here as always and the Fall Out Boy we know entertains us once again.  However, there is a new-found maturity vocally and in the songwriting that we haven't heard Wentz and the boys pull off before.  Banging first single \\"I Don't Care\\" should be Fall Out Boy's most catchy and commercial hit, even if it didn't blow up the airwaves to the same degree as \\"This Ain't A Scene\\" (which peaked at #2). With the pop-punk sensibility combined with sick guitar effects and possibly synthesizer (?), \\"I Don't Care\\" is pop/rock gold, fan or not. Stump's vocal nuances and inflections are top-notch - perhaps the best vocal performance I have ever heard by him. It is a five star track by all means. This could appear on any pop-starlets album and be a mega hit.<br /><br />\\"She's My Wynona\\" does not quite trump \\"I Don't Care\\" but it is a pretty consistent follow-up track.  The drum groove is sensible to both pop and rock worlds, which shows the amazing crossover abilities a punk-pop band like Fall Out Boy can have.  \\"America's Sweethearts\\" is definitely a favorite number from FOLIE A DEUX. The anthemic introduction is quite a treat to listen to, then Stump breaks-out into his ultra soulful persona against sick guitar and bass work.  The songwriting receives an A+ in my book by all means.  Keeping up the momentum, \\"Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown On A Bad Bet\\" may not have a 'commercial' song title, but it is certainly both radio and critical gold.<br /><br />\\"The (Shipped) Gold Standard\\" is yet another hit, while \\"(Coffee's For Closers)\\" is nearly equally consistent. My personal favorite only second to \\"I Don't Care\\" and maybe \\"America's Sweethearts\\" is the phenomenal Beatles' influenced \\"What A Catch, Donnie\\", which happens to feature an all star cast (Elvis Costello, Brendon Urie, Travis McCoy, Alex DeLeon & William Beckett).  The chord progression is clearly a steal from the 1960s work of the Beatles which makes it all the more sophisticated and truly \\"brainy\\" for a pop-punk band.  \\"27\\" isn't quite a proper follow-up, but it is another consistent track.  \\"Tiffany Blews\\" featuring Lil' Wayne and \\"w.a.m.s.\\" featuring Pharrell don't allure as much as the heaviest hitters of FOLIE, but again they are solid and more than filler.<br /><br />\\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed\\" features Brendan Urie (Panic At The Disco) in an all star hit while \\"West Coast Smoker\\" ends the album energetically, if not as great as it began.<br /><br />Overall, FOLIE A DEUX is fine with only a few 'soft-spots'.  Fall Out Boy, I can proudly say, is on my top list now after the great track list from this album.  4 stars, 'America's Sweethearts'... or something like that!!!an proudly say, is on my top list now after the great track list from this album.  4 stars, 'America's Sweethearts'... or something like that!!!
1577314808|4.0|I'll admit, this book was very powerful. It changed me profoundly, and I have to say it changed me for the better. But, don't take it too seriously. If you fall too deeply into being \\"present,\\" ignoring all of your thoughts as egoic and suppressing your emotions, you may find yourself without any real direction in life. This quickly leads to unhappiness, the opposite of what the book is trying to achieve.    But, in order to be happy you must change. In order to change, you must completely immerse yourself in Tolle's message. Just at some point you MUST take a step back and realize that there is a middle ground you must walk between total ignorance and total awareness. Because we do live in a society, and society has certain expectations. Upon reflection, you may find that they are minimal and not worthy of the weight you put on them, but they exist. Ignoring them will lead to uneasiness.     My biggest disagreement with Tolle is that the mind is NOT to be ignored. The mind is the most powerful tools at humanity's disposal. Tolle taught me to harness mine, which I thank him for. Most of your thoughts are garbage, and most people do play out useless dramas over and over again. But your mind will also occasionally come up with gold. So what I took from Tolle is that you are responsible for your own headspace. You do not need to identify yourself with negative thoughts. You do not need to react emotionally to negative thoughts. But if you are thinking positive thoughts, if your thoughts make you happy, indulge yourself. Happiness does not come from thinking nothing and doing nothing. It comes from finding what you enjoy and pursuing it.     There will come a point, if you truly immerse yourself in Tolle's message, where you will be forced to ask the question, \\"money, status, material objects, and reputation do not motivate me anymore. What does motivate me?\\" This means you are on the right track, and at this point you must pursue a higher purpose. Because fulfillment lies in knowing that you personally, your life has meaning. You know why you are on this earth, what you were put here to do. Tolle rips you out of your socially conditioned state of being. Some might call it hell. But he also leaves you in purgatory. Heaven is your own to find. Tolle simply points out what won't make you happy. But the fact of the matter is that your own happiness is your own to pursue and your own to find. And your mind is the only tool that can get you there. Do not ignore your own thoughts, they do have value. In fact, they have more value than you could possibly know.    So to conclude, read the book because it needs to be read. Do not use \\"presence\\" as an excuse to not get your life handled. You have responsibilities to yourself and the people around you, do not ignore them. And remember, happiness is the goal, not mindlessness.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie had so many \\"messages\\" at so many levels. It was entertaining, yet had clear concerns and hopes for Earth's future. The humor was perfect, the visual images were fantastic and overall it was entertaining and interesting in every way.
1435109864|5.0|I've realized that despite years of watching A Christmas Carol every Christmas (either in movie or play form), I had never actually read the original text.  So this year I decided to take some time and read the book prior to seeing the play.  I wasn't disappointed...in fact, I was excited to see that the productions I've seen have been fairly true to the text.    <u>Language</u>  The language is very true to the standard Victorian form and to other works of Dickens.  The descriptions are ornate and flowery.  The lists of objects, characteristics or actions are often lengthy and overly detailed.  Once or twice, the language felt somewhat over-the-top and heavy-handed to the point that I wanted to \\"scan\\" rather than \\"read\\" the long paragraphs.  Most of the time, the language was fluid and beautiful.  I was truly drawn into Victorian England and the Christmases experienced by Ebenezer Scrooge.    <u>Characters / Setting</u>  The characters from the story have become so well known that I was curious to see if the modern day interpretations varied much from the original.  I was relieved to find that we've stayed true to Dickens' original character sketches.  Apart from Scrooge not saying \\"Humbug\\" quite as often as I thought he would, the characters were very close to what I've come to know in 20th/21st century media.    The ghosts seem to receive the most descriptive treatment which had some interesting variants I hadn't seen before.  I've seen Christmas Past often presented as a female while the book shows this ghost in a more \\"male\\" light, although still somewhat genderless...mainly just kind of ancient.  It was interesting to me also to read that Christmas Present was seen to age through the course of the journey so much so that he was on the verge of death by the time he left Scrooge.  It gave me new perspective into his life as a spirit...he effectively lived only for that day...the \\"present\\" Christmas.  When it was gone, so was he.    The human characters were excellently treated, sometimes in just a few simple lines, other times with more description, but always just enough to be vivid and full of life.    The settings were wonderfully outlined as per usual Dickens style.  I truly felt myself in his world.    <u>Plot, Theme, Pacing, etc.</u>  Again, the plot is fairly commonplace after having seen it so many times.  I tried to put myself in the perspective of a 19th century reader.  Morality tales were certainly nothing new to Victorian readers.  Nor were ghost stories.  However, Dickens' treatment of a haunted morality tale set at Christmastime felt somewhat unique.  Surely the story was seen as the social and human commentary that it was.  The working class and the lower class surely loved the message of the story...that the upper class could reform its ways and see in its heart to help out those struggling at the bottom of society.    The pacing was quick and the message was clear.  This is something I could see reading aloud with my family next December.    <u>This Edition...the other stories</u>  Before wrapping up, I wanted to leave a comment on the other stories in the book.  While I loved the title story in the book, the same adoration was felt as deeply for the other Dickens Christmas stories included in this book.  Because A Christmas Carol is a fairly short story (only about 90 pages), the editors of this edition chose to include 3 additional Christmas tales by Dickens.    <ol><li>The first, \\"A Christmas Tree Story\\", was (to me) the most tedious \\"list\\" of a story I've read in a long time.  It consisted of description after description of Christmas Tree ornaments and the branch on which they were hung.  Towards the end of the story, it became slightly interesting by giving small descriptions of the \\"Ghost Stories\\" that \\"we\\" like to tell at Christmas gatherings.  Unfortunately, each of these stories were incomplete and left me wishing Dickens would have devoted time to exploring those stories in depth rather than toiling over the mundane ornaments on the tree.</li><li>The second, \\"Nobody's Story\\", was an interesting social commentary providing thoughtful insight on the importance of any one person.  While a vaguely interesting essay, I felt the way it was tied to Christmastime was loose at best.  The best correlation would have been that of the Ghost of Christmas Present when he tells Scrooge that he (Scrooge) is worth less than Tiny Tim.  Naturally, the commentary was better presented in Christmas Carol than it was in \\"Nobody's Story.\\"  I wonder if \\"Nobody's Story\\" was a predecessor to Carol and is perhaps indicative of Dickens desire to write such a tale.</li><li>The third and final story included, \\"What Christmas Is As We Grow Older\\", is even more enigmatic.  Again, it is a sort of commentary on what people feel is important to them at different points in their lives.  It's a good essay, but any \\"storytelling\\" element to it is superficial at best.</li></ol>    <u>Overall</u>  Dickens' Christmas Carol is truly a perennial classic that should be enjoyed year after year.  Whether that enjoyment is through the book or through a well adapted movie or stage version (I've always loved the \\"George C Scott\\" version), it shouldn't matter much.  Even the movie knock-offs (such as Bill Murray's \\"Scrooged\\" or other similar treatments) still have the good sense to promote the underlying themes of the tale.    Like Scrooge, we should all seek to keep the spirit of Christmas with us throughout the year.  I don't care what your religion is or what your beliefs are (and Dickens keeps religious narrative to a minimum despite the religious nature of the holiday...perhaps due to the overarching Christian audience, he didn't feel the need to promote the religious fervor).  The themes and values taught by this Christmas Carol are morals that can and should be put in place by any member of the human race.    Let us all make the welfare of 'mankind' be our 'business' for the future.    *****  5 stars
B001BR5F4C|4.0|Quentin Tarantino has delivered a feast for the masses with a side of water, cornstarch and some red food color. As always they are great movies, but the picture quality stands out amongst other live action films. Double Dipping for these movies was a treat especially at the price.
B00005YUPO|4.0|I haven't seen \\"Baby Mozart\\" and decided to preview this one before giving it to my granddaughter.  If this one deserves the criticism of some other reviewers, the Mozart video must indeed be terrific.  The arresting images made me think I was watching in HD/Blue Ray yet, despite the visual enhancement, they're all familiar objects, toys, and child faces that should grab the little spectator's attention.  The music, too, is \\"enhanced,\\" and therein lies a potential problem.  Why must all of Bach's music--piano, organ, orchestral, choral--be played on a soft and echoey synthesizer?  It's all quite enchanting, but how often is Bach, of all composers, ever described as \\"enchanting\\"?<br /><br />I like the repeated use of Minuet in G, since that's the piece kids taking Suzuki or conventional lessons are likely to play after Twinkle Little Star.  But if Bruce Springsteen's \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" is considered suitable for innocent young ears, Bach deserves to have producers less bent on covering up his authentic authoritative voice.
B0000255AR|4.0|Of course it's well known that Ace and Peter aren't very visible with this album, some call it another \\"Gene and Paul\\" project. That it may be, but let's remember that in the late 70's, Peter and Ace were very much \\"done\\" with Kiss. Kiss may have become the Gene and Paul show, but really they're the main ones that have stuck with Kiss and never seriously looked elsewhere, Paul in particular. So, with that being understood, just look at the songs. The title track ROCKS. \\"Into the Void\\" rocks as well, and let's not forget \\"Dreamin\\" and \\"Raise Your Glasses\\". This album may be full of songs dedicated to the fans and the impact that Kiss has had on us, but I'm glad that they did that. Sure some of those songs get old after a while, but I love the way Kiss acknowledges their fans. Listen to the music, check out one of the shows from this tour, and let that speak for itself. This is a very good album.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This product is a really great purchase.  The TrueHD picture is absolutely gorgeous, along with lossless sound makes the perfect combination for your upgraded entertainment system.  The only draw back to this series is the lack of any new or special extra features to take advantage of the dual-layer Blu-ray disks.  There is a lot of space there to be had.  Other than that, the series is so awesome that I couldn't stand to give it anything less than 5/5 stars.

0316017922|5.0|This book is a true page-turner.  Many of the chapters tell interesting stories that explain why certain people or groups of people are successful at what they do.  However, there are some very practical sections too.  Scientific evidence showing that success cannot be achieved without extensive practice and that children should be taught to speak intelligently to authority figures are two of the best examples of why this book is a resource for practical applications.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|The star power alone is reason enough to view this film, a remake of the 1939 original. Do yourself a favor and don't view this film or completely base your choice on whether or not to view it or buy it on reviews comparing it to the original. I viewed The Women, written and directed by Diane English, without any expectations. In this 21st century version, a group of four women, each a well-defined individual (although perhaps a bit stereotypical) reacts to and faces the topic of betrayal.<br /><br />Meg Ryan, Mary, is a Connecticut housewife and philanthropist, raising a child with the help of a live-in nanny and a housekeeper (Cloris Leachman). Mary learns her high-profile husband is having an affair with the gorgeous \\"spritzer girl,\\" played by the VERY hot Eva Mendes. She works at the Saks' perfume counter. Mary's friend, Sylvia (played by Annette Bening) is a between-relationships/childless/magazine editor. She actually learns of the infidelity first and shares the news with their other two friends. Jada Pinkett Smith is Alex, an author/lesbian and Debra Messing plays the fertile-mertyl of the group, Edie, who is pregnant . . . again. Along with Mary's mother, played by Candice Bergen, the friends do their best to try and get Mary through this difficult time. It's by no means a smooth ride and the friendship between Sylvia and Mary is particularly tested. I thought the substance of friendship dynamics rang very true.<br /><br />Definitely a chick-flick, but an intelligent one especially suited for middle-aged women. I don't think a single man makes an appearance in the film. Watch it with your girlfriends, sisters, mothers, aunts and / or daughters.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]].

Some of these episodes are better than others--but as an overall package this is one of the most sweeping war epics you'll ever see.  By the end, you're so invested with \\"Easy Company\\" that the slight \\"twist\\" at the end will just leave you completely breathless.      A lot of folks compare this to Saving Private Ryan.  Well, OK.  Some of the same people were involved and it has the same look.  But because this has more range and flexibility I think it is by far a superior experience to Ryan.    With all of the \\"super hero\\" movies (which I like) permeating the box office, it's nice to watch something with real life superheroes.  And these guys were heroes.

B000BSLU2S|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 is the best thermal compound on the market. There are other types that might be better for specific purposes (Arctic C&eacute;ramique for example), but for cooling a CPU, this is the best. I've used it extensively for quite a few computer builds as well as a few 'special projects' like replacing the thermal compound on an Asus Formula X48 mother board's Northbridge and Southbridge heatsinks.<br /><br />The results are always a 4-10c drop in CPU temperatures under load. You will not notice a huge difference at idle. The real gains in heat dissipation come when the CPU is being pushed. Also, don't trust the board makers proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like RealTemp 2.41 or Everest for free (use google to find them). Either will give you more accurate numbers than Asus PC Probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.<br /><br />There are some saying Arctic Silver 5 didn't lower their temperatures. That is almost certainly because they're using it incorrectly, which I can understand since the instructions provided are minimally useful. So for those of you who are not familiar with applying thermal paste, here is the process:<br /><br />1. Remove the old thermal compound. This is accomplished by using Isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. I recommend purchasing an [[ASIN:B0007TOR08 ArctiClean kit]]. For minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer. Apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. You might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. Wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.<br /><br />2. Apply a surface cleaner. You can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit. Make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.<br /><br />3. Apply Arctic Silver 5. DO NOT USE TOO MUCH! If you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the CPU locking mechanism, your hands, etc... It makes a real mess. Start with a small amount and add more if necessary. The idea here is to get a THIN, EVEN LAYER across the entire chip surface. A toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. You should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. Less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.<br /><br />4. Install your heat sink and fan assembly. I recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by Intel are notoriously poor. Zalman makes some great ones. Do NOT buy on that uses push pins to lock in place. You want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your CPU. This is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.<br /><br />If you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps. Just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf. The compound simply allows for a much better transfer for heat from chip-->heatsink. I swear by Arctic Silver, and I promise you it works if you use it correctly.clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.     3. Apply Arctic Silver 5.

0786888628|4.0|In this highly political and personally skewed account of the Korean War, Halberstam does a good job of explaining what the average soldier went through fighting in a war that no one in the US wanted.  No one except Douglas MacArthur, and he wanted to turn it into a major ground war with Red China.  It was a war caused by the goading of Mao by Stalin and the unrealistic attitude of Kim Il-Sung that the South wanted a communist regime.      The initial success of the North Koreans when they attacked, was due to the weakness of the military structure of the South, and the 'racist attitude' of Douglas MacArthur.  The southern military was run by an officer corp that owed their positions to partisan politics not military knowledge.  MacArthur considered the 'Asian' soldier to be 'laundreymen' and not able to overcome the 'huge' technology gap between them and the US military.  He was also confident that the Red Chinese would NEVER enter the war.  Well he was wrong on both counts and the US and UN both had their noses bloodied badly.    Halberstam spends way to much time going over the geopolitical and domestic issues related to the war and only spends short excerpts describing the actual fighting and strategies.  Much to much space is given to excoriating MacArthur (though he deserves it) and his sycophants in Tokyo and their non-running of the war.  This was the way that Westmoreland was to run Vietnam from his compound in Saigon (with the same results).      The discussion of the politics behind the scenes is interesting but redundant, overdone and overblown.  Halberstam could have shortened this book by one hundred pages and made it much more interesting.    Zeb Kantrowitz
B000MV8AE0|2.0|Any movie, play or novel about a great composer has great potential. These persons usually have complex, nuanced personalities, and lead interesting lives (well, there are exceptions, see Rossini). Beethoven is exhibit A. So the subject should be an easy one to make a great movie out of.     However, this particular movie disappoints greatly, I am sorry to say. Its nonfictional elements are historically inaccurate, the dialogue is sometimes silly, and the movie lacks a plot. Where is the plot? Granted, we may have no right to expect a plot of the caliber of the \\"Amadeus\\" plot  (which was conceived in the 19th century by Alexander Pushkin, one of the great geniuses of Romantic literature). But this movie lacks any credible plot. As for historical inaccuracy, and also utter silliness, see for example the scene where the \\"Moonlight\\" sonata is mentioned. In fact, the sonata was not called \\"Moonlight\\" until after Beethoven's death. It also may have not occurred to the writers of this film that the expression \\"mooning someone\\" may not have existed in 19th-century German.    \\"Immortal Beloved\\",  while no \\"Amadeus,\\" is a movie with a credible plot and much less insulting to the viewers and to the composer than \\"Copying Beethoven.\\" I would recommend it.

0385736002|5.0|When I finished the last Harry Potter book, I felt a little sad for the story to end. Then I found The Alchemyst and it's like an addition to the Harry Potter story!  Excellent Reading and I can't wait to read the next book about the Immortal Nicholas Flamel!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|If you love the Beatles, this movie is for you!  Seriously, the songs are different enough so they aren't cheesy, but very well done renditions.  The sound track is unbelievable.
0890090572|5.0|This is one of the nicest editions of Conan Doyle's Sherlock mysteries that I have come across in a long time. It is a beautifully bound version with good illustrations, nice type, and a handsome cover. I'm delighted I purchased this book.
0307455874|5.0|This book gave me some important insights into the next president of our country. He is a thoughtful, honest man and reading about how he thinks about governing was a very hopeful thing.
B000NIVJEU|4.0|I love the fact that there are reviews posted for this movie even before it is released on Blue Ray.  Ladies and Gentlemen...may I have your attention please!  I am interested in how the Blue Ray version compares to the DVD version...NOT YOUR OPINION OF THE MOVIE!<br /><br />Lol...seriously...I am not going to buy this movie based on how much you like it (or not) but the quality of the Blue Ray its self.  Stop wasting readers' time with how Hollywood messed up another book-to-movie translation.  Instead, tell me how do the sound effects sound compared to the rather weak ones that come with the standard DVD?  How is the 1080p quality of the film?<br /><br />If you want to pretend to be a movie critic to to metacritics.com or some other site where this type of information is wanted and appreciated.  These reviews are for people considering paying the extra for a Blue Ray as opposed to another DVD!<br /><br />Thank you for your time.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has taken populr opinion on what it takes to be \\"successful\\" and turned it on its ear.  I teach in public middle schools and high schools.  A minority of my students think that hard work is more important than to be born with \\"it\\", whatever \\"it\\" is.  Good math students are popularly seen as being naturally \\"good\\" at math while the less industrious ones lean on their parent's excuse of \\"I was never very good at math.\\"  The 10,000 hours of practice required to become \\"good\\" at ANYTHING is a number I can support.  I have taught students from kindergarted through graduate school in college.  The more dedicated to their education, the \\"smarter\\" these students become.  The message delivered by Mr. Gladwell is music to my ears.  I have quoted his stories in all of my classes to extremely receptive audiences.  I heartily endorse this book for students of all ages.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This BBC series is a dramatic satire of high political life and political power. It is set in the 1990's in the U.K., but it's plot and characters are universal.  It portrays the rise of power of a Maciavelian power broker after the fall of Margaret Thatcher. It also presents a new king, clearly meant to be Charles.  It's cleverness walks between hysterical and unnerving.  Ian Richardson's portrayal of the main character, Francis Urquhart (\\"F.U.!\\") is absolutely brilliant.  His \\"Lady McBeth\\" wife is great too.  I recommend this to anyone interested in politics, power, and satire.
B00026WU82|5.0|I know there are others that would disagree but Dylan going electric was the greatest and probably one of the most controversial things in music history. This isn't my favorite Dylan album but with that said it's absolutely incredible and essential. So many people have great reviews about this album and their right! I couldn't pick out a favorite song on this because like any Bob album they always say something new and I always get a different feeling from it. To anybody thinking about buying, do it, no matter if its for pleasure or pure music education, it's essential.
B000TGCR3I|1.0|This is a wonderful, wonderful movie.  I really hate to give it one star, so to be clear, the one star is to draw attention to the fact that Sony has TOTALLY RUINED this disc.  This is a copy-protected DVD and will only play in standard DVD players.           I have tried to play this with a number of DVD programs in Windows and it fails every time.  This was confusing to me until I looked at the back of the DVD case and saw the little Sony copy protection logo.  Makes sense now.  It's truly, truly baffling why Sony does this to legitimate, paid for DVD's.  I have a hard time convincing myself not to buy bootleg DVD's that work better, everywhere, at a third of the price.         I have since figured out how to play this movie on my computer and the irony of it will keep me entertained well into my sunset years.      Good job, Sony.  Last movie I ever buy from you guys.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this to supplement the controller I got in my MGS4 PS3 bundle and it works so well. I love it and recommend it if you can get it!
1400063515|5.0|Taleb challenges the Gaussian modeling premises underlying various financial/sociological phenomenon. Fat-tails are challenging thin-tails for order beyond the six sigma.     Taleb does hint at the macro-economic actions that cause Black Swans to occur and escalate; but he refrains from driving the point home:    \\"In the summer of 1982, large American banks lost..everything they ever made in the history of American banking--everything. They had been lending to South and Central American countries that all defaulted at the same time..\\"an event of an exceptional nature.\\"..the bankers led everyone, especially themselves, into believing that they were \\"conservative\\". They are not conservative; just phenomenally skilled at self-deception...[This repeated again a decade later in early 1990s when..] the savings and loan industry required a taxpayer-funded bailout of more than half a trillion dollars. The Federal Reserve bank protected them at our expense; when \\"conservative\\" bankers make profits, they get the benefits; when they are hurt, we pay the costs.\\"    In the world of finance, (contrary to Taleb) these periodic Black Swan events are not really random events; there is a macro-economic logic to this madness; i.e., astute Hedge Fund managers could game this until the tall-poppy syndrome catches up.      Timely feedback loops are essential. Thus without the Gift of Pain (see author Paul Brand) , the disease of leprosy devastates the human body. Similarly, without the gift of bankruptcy, flawed economic decisions escalate into a singular Black Swan event. Capitalism uses negative feedback loops in a timely fashion; in contrast, altruism is in open-loop denial until the obvious is in plain \\"King Without Clothes\\" sight. This lack of negative feedback is the fundamental reason why draconian regulations never go away, but instead get layered in like sedimentary rocks.     Black Swan events are not necessarily negative (witness J.K Rowling's  phenomenal success); i.e., innovations could be deliberately seeded by grasping and tweaking the embedding fat-tail context. Just as there are good-fats versus bad-fats, likewise there are good fat-tails versus bad fat-tails.     All this is connected to E.O. Wilsons socio-biological re-framing of the Darwinian order--individual entities are evolving within the group context; like-wise, thin-tail phenomenon are unfolding within the fat-tail context.  If one respects the individual freedoms, these are not necessarily antagonistic evolutions; unfortunately in the current stage of human evolution, they often end up so. There is a psychologically deep, mirror-neuron level (see author/discoverer Giacomo Rizzolatti) reason why this is so; why altruism often trumps capitalism; why we as a species cannot suffer/witness chronic pin-prick pains, but instead settle for one giant tsunami of overwhelming pain such as the Great Depression.  And we may have to wait for a Wilsonian socio-biological evolution to temper our overactive mirror neurons and learn to accept the small-scale self-corrective bankruptcies before they escalate.     As an aside, Taleb is off-mark in his critique of Modern Portfolio Theory and the associated practice of Risk Management. When governments step in to rip the carpet armed with a collective mandate from populations hooked on overactive mirror-neurons, systemic risk rules; and portfolio diversification is of no value. But MPT was never designed for such a scenario; and neither does Taleb have long-term solutions for this.  But as a timely industry gadfly, Taleb shows the limitations of modern finance subject to systemic assault.  And in his search for the governing fundamentals, Taleb does bring the richness of Cognitive Sciences/Decision Sciences to the table; but missing from Taleb's table are the mirror neurons. All in all, an excellent book to read and read again.
B0016HMYEQ|4.0|A Generous Helping of Doom & Destruction. I really enjoyed this movie.  It's shot in first person handicam, but it is not as distracting as the Blair Witch.  After awhile I think I was less and less conscious of the handheld effect.  You have to be a little patient at the beginning as the characters and their personal problems are laid out.  If you like to see cities reduced to rubble you'll get a kick out of Cloverfield.
B00006CXSS|2.0|I ordered this \\"new\\" set for a Christmas gift.  Shipping was extremely slow and when it arrived the container \\"tin\\" was dented in 3 different places.  Since shipping was so slow, I am giving it \\"as is\\" I will not order from this seller again.
B001C08RHA|5.0|My girlfriend and I loved this movie. We were always on the edge of our chairs, until it was over. We can't wait for the next one! Watch it, you will love it too.
B001DHXT20|3.0|I don't think this is any better than the 2003 version. It starts very well with Dr Banner in South America trying to control the urge within him. This reminded me of the first part of Batman Begins. Controlled film-making where you get to know the characters and they develop in front of your eyes.<br /><br />After that it was a little bit downhill. Too much CGi that wasn't always that good and the battle of the giants at the end was entirely predictable.<br /><br />Edward Norton was fine, when he was Banner, and its a shame we couldn't have had more of Tim Roth, but once they both morphed into their respective gamma-fuelled monsters I was less impressed.<br /><br />That said the use of the still memorable TV series theme tune, was a great idea, and there were lovely cameo roles for Stan Lee, Lou Ferrigno and Robert Downey Jr. Overall its certainly worth seeing but not quite the film I was hoping for....
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|I had seen this movie before, but I purchased it to get free shipping on another larger item. I was very happy with the sale price of this dvd. The movie is very interesting and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005ASGG|5.0|This is perhaps second only to The Searchers in the many great films John Ford directed. Again starring John Wayne as well as the always excellent James Stewart, Vera Miles and Lee Marvin. Essentially its a western which shows the beginning of the end for the old west.<br /><br />If you watch this you need to remember that although this was made in 1962, and that John Ford had been making films since the early part of the 20th Century (1917). So this has a different feel to any sort of modern film. The pacing is much more relaxed and the amount of 'action' that occurs is limited to two or three key scenes.<br /><br />However, the performances are uniformly excellent, the script and dialogue are mesmerising and Fords direction is impeccable. What all this 'old-fashioned' film-making allows Ford to do though, is fully develop the characters. So you get a wonderful mixture of sadness, occasional comic moments and a few typical classic western moments.<br /><br />This is a film that will reward you through repeated viewings.
B00005JNQA|5.0|Inspiring characters full of character and real humanity and insight. Plus a brilliantly portrayed and very original story. Definitely a must see in my opinion.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Movie arrived exactly as described. Brand new condition and very promptly. Would definitely buy from this seller again. Thanks!
B0007TKNII|5.0|THis movie was excellent.  I have attended the Brodaway show twice and enjoyed it each time.  This movie has a great soundtrack and the scenes were great.  I will watch this move time and again and it will be one of my video treasures.
0143039482|4.0|I was pleased, but not enraptured. Whereas \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.<br />Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.<br />Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.<br />Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting. The few brilliantly poetic sentences interspersed in passable prose kept me reading.<br />Yes, I will deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B+.
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|What a treat to recieve yet another cd from Coldplay.  I love Viva La Vida, but to know that \\"Life in Technicolor\\" has words was a pleasant surprise.  What a beautiful song.  I highly recommend it to all Coldplay fans.  They are in a league all their own.  Their musicality and lyrics rival even U2 (which I love as well).  The only song on the cd you will either love or hate is \\"lost\\" featuring Jay-z.  I understand Coldplay wanting to take a risk and broaden their horizons to incorporate some hip-hop.  The song is okay, but I still like the original one better.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I just LOVE supernatural! It's a great series, never boring and has hot men! I'd say buy it.

0307265730|4.0|I am not usually a reader of short stories, but this book defied many of my prejudices. I loved it. Jhumpa Lahiri's writing is beautiful. With just a few paragraphs, she can immerse you in a story so that you end up feeling as satisfied as if you've read an entire novel. She also has a wonderful eye for detail and a way of describing everyday events or objects so you feel that you've never really thought about them in that way before.<br /><br />There are eight stories in this book. The final three feature the same characters but the others stand alone. However they are all quite similar in that they feature highly educated Bengali Indians living in the US and often in mixed race relationships. There are also similar themes that repeat: learning to move on after losing a loved one or the relationships between parents and their adult children.<br /><br />While I enjoyed all of the stories in this book, I was particularly moved by the first (Unaccustomed Earth) and the last (Going Ashore). They are the two in which I felt the most involved and really cared about the characters. I felt somewhat detached from the others (hence the 4 star rating). However I still enjoyed them and I recommend this book without hesitation - do not let the fact that it's short stories put you off!
B001CZVVXW|5.0|Until I saw this version, my preferred Carmen was the Rossi film with Julia-Migenes and Placido Domingo.  But this is even better.  Antonacci is an even more sultry Carmen with a great voice and a superb actress.  Kaufmann is handsome and a much better actor than Placido.  D'Arcangelo is an extremely virile Escamillo.  Plus, the sets and direction create an intimate, intense production.  Add to that the wide-screen and superb sound of the blu-ray and you have everything that a video opera should be. Buy this!  You won't regret it in any way!
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|In typical Enya fasion.... another beautiful collection with a christmassy theme.  This is not a let down for Enya fans.
B000002552|3.0|Parts of this review were used in a review of The \\"Genuine\\" Basement Tapes from this same period. I make most of the same objections here for this set as I did there, except if you need to choose between the two the quality of the production values here is greater than on the former. Although the more I listen to Volume 5 of the \\"genuine\\" with that \\"Joshua Gone Barbados\\" and hard to hear but mesmerizing  cover by Dylan of \\" I Forgot To Remember to Forget\\" and a couple of others I am starting to waiver.       In a review of Bob Dylan's \\"The Freewheeling Bob Dylan\\" elsewhere in this space I noted:     \\"In reviewing Bob Dylan's 1965 classic album \\"Bringing All Back Home\\" (you know, the one where he went electric) I mentioned that it seemed hard to believe now that both as to the performer as well as to what was being attempted that anyone would take umbrage at a performer using an electric guitar to tell a folk story (or any story for that matter). I further pointed out that it is not necessary to go into all the details of what or what did not happen with Pete Seeger at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 to know that one should be glad, glad as hell, that Bob Dylan continued to listen to his own drummer and carry on a career based on electronic music.\\"    And I am still glad of that fact. What I am less enamored of is the virtual cottage industry that has grown up around various, bootleg, basement, cellar, barn, attic or other odd locations versions of Dylan's work, electric or acoustic. This archival material is nice for folk, rock and cultural historians but I would argue that Mr. Bob Dylan's usually well-produced albums are after over forty years more than enough to listen to without having to get into the minutia of his career. And, somehow, left to feel that one has missed something without this other more esoteric material.  That same sentiment applies to the virtuoso work of The Band in their heyday. And certainly to their joint work here. In short, this two disc set of practices, outtakes, cuts, etc. done with The Band while Dylan was \\"hiding\\" out in rural New York after his motorcycle accident are strictly for aficionados.     That said, for those who insist on getting their little hands on this material here is the \\"scoop\\". \\"Tears Of Rage\\" ; \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\"; \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\" and \\"Goin' To Acapulco\\" are what you are getting this CD for. That does not seem like enough given what I mentioned above.
0385510454|5.0|I have read all John Grisham's books. I have enjoyed his 'lawyer' books, though not his other offerings. However 'The Broker' stroke a cord with me, too such an extent that I read the book several times in the first year. Something I have never done with any other book.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|We get it!! some people don't the whole home video movie angle. Fine then don't watch this movie! If you are someone who thinks the most important criteria for a film is that the camera is stable, then this movie is not for you. There is no point in even reviewing Cloverfield if you are one of these people. Stop spamming this film with one stars and get over it! I don't like romantic comedies. So you know what I do about it? I don't watch them. No need to watch one after another in hopes that my mind will someday change. Unless you are getting paid to review films or you are a masochist then I have no idea why someone would watch a genre they don't like.     As for the fans of this style of filming, Cloverfield is the movie for you. Especially if, like me, you have a nostalgic childhood love affair with classic Godzilla flicks. If you are like me then you know that to give any critique of this film's plot or of its actors is to completely miss the point of the entire movie. Films like this are not about making a cookie cutter film. They are about one thing and one thing only. \\"The Ride\\".    The goal of a film like Cloverfield is to immerse the viewer into a unrealistic scenario as if it were real. It's fun to be chased by monsters. That's IT! Being chased by monsters is fun. That's the film. If you weren't such an elitist snob maybe you could indulge in such simple pleasures. It's your loss though. Cloverfield is a GREAT ride. I enjoyed every minute of it. And like any great ride the first thing I wanted to do when I got off, was get back on.
B00005M2CP|5.0|This product is great! I am giving it as a christmas gift and when I received it I noticed that there were no scratches or any wear on the item. This is a great item!
1589944607|5.0|This is one fun game to play with a group of people. The game itself, is a bit more complicated than the average board games. At first, it seemed that we were just going through the manuals endlessly. It took us an entire game to figure out the game play. But once you get a hang of it, it was great fun.     Overall, it's a game about decisions and deceptions. What makes this game interesting is that nobody can prove that he or she is not a cylone because game rule prohibits you from doing so. Because of that, cylone accusations often flies left and right during the game until the real cylone is revealed.     The minimum players for the game is 3, but I think you'll need 4 player to get a semi decent game play. You really want to have 5 or 6 players to get the most fun out of the game.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I loved this movie!  It is very well crafted and expertly animated.  It is a joy for the  whole family and will be a joy to watch 10 years from now. Pixar has done it again!  This is a masterpiece!
0446579939|3.0|I don't read many \\"romance\\" type books but I did enjoy this one.  My only complaint is on page 253 (large print book!).  They are making homemade ice cream and \\"she chose sugar, flour, and vanilla extract.\\"  WHO puts FLOUR into ice cream?      Anyways, I thought this book was OK, predictable but an easy weekend read.
B00168OINK|5.0|Picture is just as good as Ratatouille or even better. Watching on Sony ps3 coupled with onkyo 606 receiver and samsung 40Ln550.

B001GJOL22|5.0|Fantastic video and sound quality.  Impeccable.  Not only is this a first rate concert, but really shows that RUSH is still at the top of their game.  Must also mention, the disc really shows off RUSH's great sense of humor!  Rotisserie chicken anyone??!!  And I love the swami!!<br /><br />A must buy for any RUSH fan, as this Blu Ray is a crown jewel for RUSH.<br />***** stars.
