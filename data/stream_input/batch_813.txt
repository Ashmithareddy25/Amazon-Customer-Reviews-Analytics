0446402389|4.0|A reasonably innovative crime novel set in the Soviet Union in the early 1950s.  The plot, involving a search for a serial murderer, is moderately innovative.  The hero is a secret policeman and loyal servent of the state who inadvertantly stumbles across the trail of the murderer. Somewhat against his will, the hero becomes a Chandleresque seeker for truth in a society where looking for the truth is very, very hazardous.  While the murderer's motive is somewhat contrived and the quality of writing awkward, Smith makes a sincere effort to portray the ghastly nature of life in the Stalinist Soviet Union.

B000002KLP|4.0|This is no where near the quality of \\"Purple Rain.\\"  You can predict the lyrics before he sings them and they are about as deep as a mud puddle and equally dirty.  The musicianship and production are equally simplistic (nothing against Prince as I know he did this on his own with a $5 budget).  BUT, this CD is fun as it can get.  The production takes me back to junior high in the early 80's when this music was cutting edge.  Naming the CD \\"Dirty Mind\\" is spot on as it is pretty filthy.  \\"Sister\\" is absolutely disturbing.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|You will love this Snakes and Arrows DVD for many reasons. As a drummer, one of the best things about it should be Neil Peart's Rotterdam Netherlands drum solo! When I saw Neil play his drum solo in Virginia in July of 2008, it was the best drum solo I've ever seen in my entire life! Well I guess maybe tied with Buddy Rich because I saw him once but that's jazz and he's Buddy Rich - long story. You know, Rush will not disappoint if you get this DVD - they never have. They are hard workers, humanitarians, seem like super nice musicians and in my opinion RUSH is the best rock music band in the universe, but I'm biased! I've been Neil's biggest fan since I was 10 years old! We love you very much Neil, Ged and Alex!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really great workout video. I like how they show modifications to some of the workouts on the dvd, which makes this dvd really great. It makes it easy for everyone to workout. I also like how there are three different levels of difficulty in it. All in all, this is a great workout video. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to lose weight.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|Great CD. It was a birthgift for my wife. We saw the movie and I ordered the CD after.
0143038419|5.0|I bought the book only to fulfill the quota of a book club I had joined.  I had heard a radio interview with the author and liked her, so I picked this out of the huge catalog of possible purchases.      I found it so much better than I had expected.  I had a really hard time putting it down and have been telling my friends about it ever since reading it.  First of all, the author is a very talented writer.  I laughed out loud many times, and I'm not naturally an out-loud laugher.  She manages to be wise and funny and instructive all at once.  I normally only read \\"spiritual\\" books but I found this one to be much more inspiring and insightful than a bunch of the more serious kind.  Don't be fooled by the light hearted tone--there is a lot of wisdom here.    I've read a few of the reviews, both negative and positive.  Some of the negative comments amaze me, but it's a fact that people can only see what their minds can let them see.  I am really glad that so many folks have seen the value in it.   I found myself discussing it with my doctor (who quickly wrote down the name) and pondered what I could take from this woman's story for my own life.  It's that kind of book.  She speaks from a deep level and if you are open to its message, you can mine some gold for your own life.     To those who fear buying the book because some reviewers found it superficial and self-obsessed, I say that it could just be a mirror for the reader.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This album should have been great. Excelent songs in \\"old school\\" Metalica style.    However, someone involved in making this album decided to destroy it. Listening to this CD for any length of time makes you wonder if you stereo is broken. The first time I turned this albub on, I thought someone had busted my speakers.    The music is so compressed and mangeled, one can only guess at the great quality of the music hidden within.

I think the people that are saying this book was bad were expecting something completely different.  I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the next one.
0375424474|5.0|If you are interested in a good, nontechnical book on how much our body design owes to our evolutionary past, this book could be for you. Shubin is an excellent writer. There is not a boring page in the book. He has a real knack for making complex ideas understandable without talking down to the reader. This is lost on a few reviewers who seem to mistake clarity for lack of depth. If this book turns some readers on to investigate science more deeply, that will be a great thing.     In particular, his account of the evolution of wrists, ears, eyes, and even animal bodies themselves, as evidenced by both fossil evidence and DNA similarities makes it clear that if a \\"Designer\\" were responsible for all this, \\"he\\" would be more of a tinkerer, making use of old parts and forcing them to do new things. Naturally these changes took millions of years to happen, being the slow result of tiny mutations in each generation of life. This is the thing that is so hard to comprehend for most who doubt this explanation for life's diversity. One can't directly comprehend two billion years of life's evolution. But science shows us that its record is written in our bodies themselves. We all carry this record, and we should be proud that we've made it this far.
031606792X|2.0|First I have to say that I loved the first three books and I was so exited about the conclusion of the series... What a dissapointment... This book had such a sickenly happy ending, it was disgusting. Up to the first two parts of the story (book 1 and book 2:Jacob), I still had high hopes for this novel. But just when Bella became a vampire and Jacob imprinted on her daughter (btw, that was weird!!), everything started to fall out of place for me. I lost total interest in the story (it took me like two weeks just to read the last part, because I really didn't care anymore about what was happenning). I guess in that last part I had two big problems: 1) Once Bella becomes a vampire, it is almost as if Meyer introduced a different character and it is hard to connect with her again. She is the epiphany of perfection, just like any vampire and that average girl we all came to adore got lost. 2) I always felt a greater appreciation for Jacob rather than Edward, just because Jacob was the human one. He was the one who could make a mistake and had to work to fix it, after all, you can't have a REAL relationship where everything is perfect (you'd be bored to death!!!). To me Jacob was the one who had to fight for something, whereas Edward always had everything there in his hands. When Jacob imprinted on Nessie, he bacame as sickening as Edward and Bella. Aside from this, there couldn't have been a crappier ending. I mean, even the bad guys end up all nice and happy... COME ON!!!     Besides, Bella ends up being a no-one, but the story mekes her look like she has accomplished everything in her life just because she has Edward. She doesn't go to college, she separates from her friends, she doesn't care much about her parents... But everything's perfect cause she has Edward... COME ON!!!!!     And for the very ending, I'm sure everyone was expecting an epic battle between the Volturi and all the other vampires. After most of the last part being about how the Cullens gathered all the other covens and convinced them to stand against the Volturi, and we are told about each of their abilities and the abilities of the Volturi. All they do is TALK. I didn't wait 700 pages to have someone have a diplomtic talk and everyone to be comprehensive and understanding... COME ON!!    To say soemthing good... It was quite bold of Meyer to change the point of view from Bella to Jacob, but I deffinately think it worked for the best. It was nice to see things from a different perspective. And Jacob was funnny and sarcastic, but still had heart. Nice move.     All in all, the novel is pretty good up until the end of the second book. After that, you can close the book and make up your own ending. It deffinately is better that reading that crap of an ending.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|SPEED RACER was one of the first anime imports. (Look it up on Wikipedia.) Even dubbed it had an Asian look and humble manner. As a kid watching it on TV alongside of WB, Disney and other studios' toons; I could notice its different style from domestic cartoons. Little did I know what the future held for Asian animation!  This live but graphic film version on Blu-ray has a fantastic design and picture. Although it seems like a 3 minute cartoon crammed into a 2 hour movie,  I think that was the intention and it is entertaining fun. I was a bit surprised and let down that this new BD only had the 'Original Recipe Sound' and I thought of waiting. (It is sure to be re-released with the 'Extra Crispy Sound'.) The newer BD sound formats are so 'full' that I can't hear my air conditioner; so I'll just have to turn up the sound, even though it's not the same. The DD track is great; but it's not on par with the out of sight picture which makes it worth picking up. They really caught the look and mood of the early anime cartoon; which did have a VERY simple, innocent nature and gave it a pumped up modern live/anime look. This is the kind of film that critics love to hate and dance on. It deserves better attention for what it does do: look hot! And if it's not deep enough for you; try Popeye, he's got angst!
1844080390|4.0|For those of you who have never read DuMaurier, you're missing out on the adventure and intrigue of days gone by.  I myself visited the actual Jamaica Inn last year in Launceton, England, and felt the undercurrents of the dark events that once took place there.  Just great reading.
B000P0I9T4|1.0|I've had it of describing what the \\"loudness war\\" is. Just Google the expression between quotes and you'll get tens of thousands of results to peruse. So I'm just going to say that this release features the worst type of \\"loudness war\\" mastering, when the audio volume is pushed beyond the CD format specification limits and \\"clipping\\" (loss of parts of the audio) occurs. These comments refer to the mono releases (Snapper's \\"jewel case\\", Repertoire's and all the Japanese releases) - the stereo (Snapper's digipack) release is mastered within the CD's dynamic range, but the mix is very annoying, with vocals on one channel and instruments on the other.
0743437497|5.0|I just happen to finish this book today, which I just found out is Mr. King's birthday (Sept. 21st). After reading King's The Tommyknockers and Lisey's Story, which were exasperatingly wordy, I found The Shining a real treat to read. The novel has a richness that Kubrick's film lacked completely. King has a superb talent for creating characters that seem unbelievably real. You really get to know the characters inside and out - especially Jack. He's a good, highly intelligent educated father that loves his family and tries really hard to do good for them (like giving up alcohol) but he just has a real bad temper (he bites his tongue and restrains his fists throughout most of the story). Unable to find work, his friend hires him to take care of The Overlook Hotel during the winter season. From the very beginning, Jack and his family have to contend with the dark supernatural forces that live within the hotel. Not only does Jack have to battle against his constant craving for a drink, the hotel's evil forces play on his temperament and drudges up his past; namely, his relationship with his abusive father when Jack was a young boy himself. He starts to feel that his struggles to provide for his family go unappreciated, and he ultimately ends up personifying his father and the Overlook itself, sending him off into a murderous rage.    Blessed (or cursed) with the shining, Jack's son, Danny, seems to suffer the most. Not only does he have to endure terrifying encounters with ghouls and ghosts, his sixth sense does not spare him the terror of what's to come.     And poor Wendy.......     There are many scenes in the novel that the movie did not have, and many scenes in the movie that the novel did not have. The climax and ending were completely different. So just because you saw the movie, doesn't mean you won't enjoy this riveting story all over again in book form. If you get your hands on this book, just make sure you have plenty of free time planned ahead because once you pick it up you're not going to want to put it down.     HAPPY BIRTHDAY Mr. King! :) You truly are a genius in every sense of the word.

B000002IFP|5.0|Simply Red has had a career of inventive, original high quality music under the supervision of highly gifted lead vocalist Mick Hucknall - a truly gifted jazz and blues singer. Sadly they have said no new music is to come. So we must relish the great music they have already provided us. After a huge success with their first album PICTURE BOOK they had a lull with their second. Then came this, A NEW FLAME and Simply Red came back to life. What an amazing set which provides the group the ability to showcase all their assets. Their music is truly original which is rare. Mick Hucknall takes a song and wraps his emotive vocals tenderly around the lyrics. He can swoon, he can jam, he can do it all.<br /><br />Hits here are IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW, IT'S ONLY LOVE and A NEW FLAME. There is no filler on this cd. All the songs are great. Other standouts are YOU'VE GOT IT and ENOUGH. Simply Red has had longevity but has also been very underrated. This cd show how great they are and the stamp they have put on the history of music. Definite quality jazz/r@b here and a highly recommended must have.
B00168ML1G|2.0|I will just rate it according to the merit of its video and audio part, not the movie itself.    One word: BAD.    Video: It has good details (HD grade), but the contrast and brightness is off, I have to lower the brightness by a huge amount, and pump up the contrast, the result is still not a 3D picture as you would expect from a BR movie. (6/10)    Audio: This is where it sucks, the bass is liked farting inside a bag (sorry for the words, but it really is the best description), you don't feel it that much, the surround effect is minimum. You have to turn the volume up and then the dialogue may be too loud. May be it needs some huge adjustment as the video, but I have no time or interest to do it. (3/10)
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I must admit that I have never played SILENT HILL, the game. Consequently, I was completely mind-f'ed by the gloriously gruesome visuals and über-nightmarish set pieces. I had to watch it a second time in order to pay closer attention to the actual storyline. I consider this movie to be like a much  darker (considering what is required of anyone wanting to enter SILENT HILL in the first place), more adult version of LABYRINTH. Rose (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) loses her daughter in the ghostly town of the title, and must go on a life threatening / mind altering adventure through its many mouldering halls and alleys. Along the way, Rose is joined by officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden from The Mist and TV's X-Files), who is drawn into the same hideous encounters w/ the various demonic denizens of this hellish place. Together, they must not only face legions of demons, but also a crazed religious cult led by Kristabella (Alice Kriege from Ghost Story, Star Trek: First Contact, and Sleepwalkers), who is Jim Jones in a woman's skin. Rose and Cybil find themselves in the middle of a war between two dark forces bent on destroying each other. The monsters are memorable, especially the main demon (w/ his gigantic cheese-grater helmet and telephone pole sized butcher's knife!!), and those murderous, knife-wielding nurses! Highly recommended...
0375826726|2.0|Listen, I like the book series and I don't really care that it is not that   original in story. But this book was to tedious to read. Eragon goes on and on about oaths and killing, and Arya, I got so tired of reading it that I went to wikipedia to find the good stuff that happens. I am convinced however that he will end the series on a better note because this book was just to laborious for me to read. Rent it from the library or buy at your own risk.
B000002GFT|4.0|Liege and Lief is a very nice album.  The vocal melodies, while simplistic and repeat a bunch of times, are interesting enough to keep my attention, and interesting enough to tell a good story.  The female singer is really good.  Some of the arrangements are really good as well.  They can let loose and jam out with the best of them.      Fairport Convention sound like they were big fans of Bob Dylan's style of songwriting at the time- sing more or less the same melody over and over while changing the lyrics each time in order to build a story for the lyrically-minded people.  An album worth owning.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|As one who was a young teen when the thrash metal genre was born and as one who has faithfully waved the metal flag over the past 25 years, I am submitting this \\"as objective as I can be\\" review of the latest offering by one of the forefathers of this genre.  To put this into perspective, I go as far back as to a time when driving around the neighborhood in a junker car attached to a 1000 watt car stereo system blasting \\"Seek And Destroy\\" and \\"Am I Evil?\\" until all the neighbors could repeat the lyrics ad nauseam was considered a popular recreational activity.    First off, when I heard Rick Rubin was going to produce this record, I couldn't have been more ecstatic.  Realizing that Bob Rock would have no influence on this release meant that finally, there might be a chance the band would rediscover its roots instead of running and hiding from them.  And that's exactly what has happened here.    Death Magnetic is a triumphant return to form of the pre-Black album that those of us who have been around long enough had one day hoped for.  It's not \\"Puppets II\\", nor does it need to be.      A few of these tracks give me goose bumps which is something I haven't been able to say about a single Metallica cut since \\"Justice\\".  And speaking of that, hints of \\"Justice\\" can be heard all over the disc which in itself is great thing considering that 1988's \\"...And Justice For All\\" was, in my opinion, the last great slab of metal from the band... Until now.    This offering has a ton of great hooks and riffs and is just so damn listenable I can't sit up and hit the repeat button although I really want to most of the time.  Each time I try, the next track just grabs a hold of me and forces me to listen all the way through.  The cycle then repeats over and over.. It's a beautiful thing.    Highlights include the driving, full-on, \\"Blackened\\"-esque opener (my favorite cut) \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" featuring a killer Kirk Hammett solo that seems to have been pulled directly out of the \\"Puppets\\" playbook, \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\", a hard-hitting, modernized fist-pounder, \\"All Nightmare Long\\" with its catchy yet eerie intro and it's proclivity towards the violent, \\"The Judas Kiss\\" with passages in the vein of \\"Justice's\\" title track, \\"Suicide And Redemption\\", a slightly watered-down yet modernized \\"Call Of   Ktulu\\" from the \\"Ride\\" days with a couple of guitar solos (single and duel) that are two for the ages, and \\"My Apocolypse\\" with its wide open, throttling riffs reminiscent of old favorites like \\"Battery\\" and \\"Damage Inc.\\" albeit with just a touch less forcefulness yet closing the deal expertly.    I can't give this one 5 stars considering my somewhat biased links to the past.  But 4 1/2 is perfectly legit.  The post-1990 crowd may have a little bit of a difficult time adjusting to this one and as an old school metaller, that's perfectly fine with me, but on the flip side, what Death Magnetic will do is showcase a few of the grand roots of the genre.  For those of us who've been there since the beginning, Death Magnetic represents a rebirth and gives us hope that maybe someday, we'll get to hear that oh so desired musical ear candy we pray to the metal gods for; \\"Master Of Puppets II\\".  Great job by the band and here's to the old school!

I highly recommend it if you like crime drama and can stomach some edgier elements.

B00004U8P9|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show has been around for 33 years now, and I still hear people ask \\"What's the appeal to this?  It looks dumb!!\\"  Well, my friends, the only way to find out is to be willing to overlook the stupidity, and allow yourself to simply enjoy the ride for what it is...an iconic mosaic of insanity.<br /><br />Back in 1981, I had the priviledge of seeing this movie for the first time...6 years after it's emergence.  I was 16 years old, and knew absolutely NOTHING about it...with the exception that it was THE movie to see on a Friday or Saturday night.  Pretty much everyone in my high school had seen it, and I wasn't about to be left out, so off I go, into the unknown.  I didn't know about being called out as a \\"virgin\\", or being \\"lei-d\\" until I got there and one of my friends spied me (she turned me in to the \\"cast\\").  From the moment I was marked with that huge V on my forehead, I was hooked!!!  What was to be just a movie experience turned into one of the wildest rides of my life!!<br /><br />Now, it's 2008, and I STILL go to live shows of RHPS.  I am proud of the fact that I know every word, both in the movie, and of what the audience says in return.  I am proud (even if a bit dumb) that I've seen this movie in that way 34 times, and will be making that 35 this Halloween.  I do dress up...I fully participate...and once again, I enjoy that wonder I felt from that day so long ago.<br /><br />Perhaps it's a bit childish, but the originality of the whole story remains after all this time.  Since there are plenty of reviews that explain the basic story plot, I won't bother you with all that.  These days, most people have seen at least part of this movie, and the story line is out there for anyone wanting to learn more.  And yes...to be honest, the story line sucks, and yet...it's wonderful at the same time.  It's a spoof of old horror films, and that's it.  Yet, this spoof has outlived some of the more classic films that have fairly good plot lines (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby), and it's done it BECAUSE it's a spoof.  It's never been intended to be taken seriously, or to truely frighten.  Au contraire...it's a complete farce, yet one that gives rise to the feeling that, if you don't pay close attention, you might miss something important.<br /><br />The DVD allows those who, for whatever reason, haven't seen a live showing, to get the feel of what is meant by audience participation, and that alone gives it great value.  Seeing this in the privacy of your home won't allow you to truely experience what RHPS is, but it WILL get you pretty close.  For those who live in areas where you can't catch a live show, this video allows you to enjoy, not only the movie, but the hilarity of making fun of it.<br /><br />Trust me...you won't go wrong with buying this one!!!Baby), and it's done it BECAUSE it's a spoof.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|As we say around here, this CD is like a \\"I want to, but I can't\\". Metallica wanted to go back to their roots, but obviously, they can not. They are burnt out, they have grown old and adrenalyne is no longer running through their bodies. In their souls any rebel attitude remain is long time dead.   When you are nearly 50 and your pockets are filled with tons of money, is SO difficult to compose punching metal, this CD is the prove. Their inspiration is long time gone, and will never come back. Turn the page.

It is so nice to have them available in one place.
061891868X|5.0|about the sociology of science, and I agree completely with what it says about it, and on the need to parcel funds and scientists more equably among the several possible approaches (for example, to fundamental physical theories). The trouble is that men are not angels, and the proposals it makes are very difficult to implement in practice. Perhaps, as Churchill said of democracy, the present system in science \\"is the worst possible one, with the exception of all the the others\\". Or, paraphrasing Juvenal 2,000 years ago: \\"Who'll watch over the fairness of the funds' and careers' administrators?\\". It really looks like an infinite regress. So perhaps the only feasible solution is to muddle through, as the human race has done over its entire history.     Other reviewers have spoken at length about the book's contents, and I will not repeat them. Suffice it to say that I don't feel qualifided to judge the relative merits/defects of string theory versus loop quantum gravity and the other \\"theories\\" that are being worked upon, although I am sympathetic to those who start from relativity, I think the \\"background independence\\" argument has some merit, and string/M theory is, in my opinion, beginning to sprout epycicles. You don't need to have worked on it to realize it. Of course I could be wrong: in this (or these) Universe(s) almost anything is possible, which, although a very trite remark, is deeply true.    But this book, although eschewing math, is written for an adult public -unlike so many ones in the market today-, doesn't simplify the issues (i.e., doesn't pretend you can really \\"understand\\" anything much without math), depicts accurately why science isn't exactly what you thought it to be, but instead in the short run (say 1½ human lifespans?) much more based on personal vanity and lust for power than on rational considerations, and, more importantntly yet, is CIVILISED. It's really refreshing to read pages unpolluted by vicious ad hominem attacks à la Lubos Motl(a learned physicist who reviewed, among others, Peter Woigt's also excellet book \\"Not even wrong ... \\"), even if it's only for appearences' sake.
0575081406|5.0|This book introduces one of the most compelling characters in fantasy that I've read in many years.  Some of the negative reviews have criticized the length of the novel, but I never once found it ponderous or overdone.  Quite the opposite; I was disappointed when it ended and found myself immediately checking into when the next novel might be available.    Rothfuss has given us a protagonist that is heroic, tragic, funny, admirable, sympathetic, and yet still believable.  His story so far is compelling, original, and worth reading, as it's 900 pages packed with drama and character development, not padded with tiresome and wasted plot threads (I'm talking to you, \\"Wheel of Time\\" series).      Most importantly, I *like* the hero of this story.  I haven't liked a hero so much since I read Joel Rosenberg's original \\"Guardians of the Flame\\" novels some 20 years ago (and, yes, I'm still angry that he killed off Karl).

B0002Y4T92|3.0|I can't say this 2 DVD set blew me away. There are some OK performances but 98% of them are just OK. I bought this (used I might add-cheap!)coming in as a guitar fan and mostly as a fan of Eric Johnson and Pat Metheny - although I do love 95% of the other great names on this disc. Most of the artist's cuts here are just OK. However.........................<br /><br /> I will keep this disc as Robert Cray plays the performance of a lifetime with TIME MAKES TWO. After reading most of the reviews (there were 158 at the time) only 2 people mention fact to this! Are you not listening people? Mr. Cray simply turns in the greatest of blues performances - he sings and plays his @ss off and lets each member of the audience (even the DVD audience)know that HE HAS THE BLUES! One of the best musical performances ever IMHO. If you don't feel something at the end of this track, well then, I don't know what to say? Maybe David Cassidy does it for you........dun'no?<br /><br /> I've seen Robert live before (mid 90s) and it was OK. He's never been my fav but I've always had respect for him. I thought more people would mention the R.C. performance. Well, out of deep respect, I am letting the whole world know about his performance. Robert, you truly deserve such praise and acknowledgement on THE BEST BLUES PERFORMANCE of the past 100 years (yeah, I heard that one note near the end but it didn't take away ANYTHING!)<br /><br /> I give it 5 stars but take away 2 because the rest of the disc is so average.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|All three of these movies are great.  Each one delves a little deeper into the matrix mythology than the one before it, which is why I think most people love the first one and hate the third.  With each progression deeper into the mythology, it becomes more complicated and difficult to understand- IF you have zero understanding of things like quantum physics and spirituality (not necessarily christianity).  Even a basic working knowledge of quantum physics and simply an open mind will take you far when watching this trilogy.  (Watching the movie \\"What the *bleep* Do We Know?\\" first might help too- it can give you a basic understanding of the principles behind this entire trilogy).  As far as a thinking person's movie goes, the third was by far the best of the three.  The first introduced something brand new to the movie going audiences, which of course cannot be topped.  But if you unbiasedly deconstruct each movie, the third is the shining star.  The ending with The Architect and the choice is a deft blending of philosophy, quantum physics, and spirituality that quite simply brings the whole point of the trilogy to a satisfying and complete close.  The thing is, you'll either \\"get\\" this trilogy as a whole, or you won't.  But don't trash the whole trilogy simply because you don't understand it.  If you're one of the ones who don't get it, it will be painfully obvious in your review because you'll just see the trilogy as a long string of great action sequences interrupted by some confusing talking stuff.  Do yourself a favor and get a little education first- read some books (not Harry Potter), watch \\"What the*Bleep* Do We Know?\\", THEN review the trilogy.  Only then will you see the trilogy as a whole and \\"get it\\".

My personal favorite songs off of this album are Broken, Beat, and Scarred, My Apocalypse, & All Nightmare Long.  Yes the production isn't the best.  We've all heard the complaints.  It does not mean that Metallica wrote a bunch of bad songs.  I highly recommend this album.
0312427999|5.0|There is a lot to be learned from THE SHOCK DOCTRINE; in its pages one may discover many of the whys behind recent events.  For example, I was mystified as to why President Bush could sink so low as to veto a bill forbidding torture.  Now I understand that veto, albeit I certainly can't condone it.  Torture is a major tool used to destroy someone's ability to comprehend what is going on while control of his or her property, and/or means of livelihood is being turned over to someone more influential.    The facts Naomi Klein reveals will make you angry, and sad, and ashamed.  And if you doubt what Klein says, read [[ASIN:0452287081 Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]] and [[ASIN:0452289572 The Secret History of the American Empire: The Truth About Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and How to Change the World]], by John Perkins.    There is the little-known story of why, in Iraq, we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, by suppressing the Iraqis' spontaneous excercise of democracy, replacing the representative bodies they elected with unrepresentative bodies appointed by Paul Bremer.    There is the story of why Federal aid after Katrina was delayed and misdirected, so that New Orleans' city government could be almost completely privatized.    And there is the story of the evil genius behind all of this and more, the mild-mannered Dr. Milton Friedman, late leading member of the economics department of the University of Chicago, whose public words were gentle and humanitarian, but whose private advice to dictators such as General Augusto Pinochet were more reminiscent of Dr. Josef Mengele of Aushwitz, except that Dr. Mengele didn't even appear mild-mannered; perhaps a better comparison would be to Oscar St. Just.    Several have commented that one should read Johan Norberg's critique of Klein.  I have read it and found it worthless. It consists solely of unsupported assertions, whereas Klein cites her sources with 74 pages of notes (more than 10% of the entire book).    Norberg begins: \\"Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine purports to be an expose of the ruthless nature of free-market capitalism and its chief recent exponent, Milton Friedman.\\" [Norberg correctly put 'The Shock Doctrine' in italics, which Amazon's text box does not permit]  But Klein's book does not purport to be an expose of free-market capitalism; she does not claim that free-market capitalism is inherently ruthless or evil.  What she amply demonstrates is the ruthlessness of a particular variety of free-market capitalism which she calls disaster capitalism, or Friedmanism, after its late leading exponent.    Norberg writes: \\"Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level.\\" but it is Norberg's critique that is hopelessly flawed.  Norberg seems to be, to borrow a phrase from Eric Flint, 'logically challenged.'  He writes: \\"Friedman's own words reveal him to be an advocate of peace, democracy, and individual rights.  He argued that gradual economic reforms were OFTEN  preferable to swift ones and that the public should be fully informed about them, . . .\\" [emphasis added]  And whose own words revealed him to be a fervent advocate of freedom, which he extolled in almost every speech? Why, none other than the late Adolf Hitler!  Also, what is often true is not necessarily always true.  There is no logical inconsistency between \\"gradual reforms are often preferable\\" and \\"these circumstances (e.g. strong popular opposition) require that changes be made swiftly, without informing the public until it is too late to stop them\\"    Norberg writes: \\"Klein's historical examples also fall apart under scrutiny. For example, Klein alleges that the Tiananmen Square crackdown was intended to crush opposition to pro-market reforms, when in fact it caused liberalization to stall for years.\\" Even if the consequences of the crackdown were as Norberg claims, that in no way disproves what Klein said about its intention. (Could it be that Norberg has led such a sheltered life that he has never heard of unintended consequences?)    Norberg goes on to write: \\"She also argues that Thatcher used the Falklands War as cover for her unpopular economic policies, when actually those economic policies and their results enjoyed strong public support. It is Norberg's argument, not Klein's historical example, that falls apart under scrutiny. On page 168, Klein writes: \\". . . by 1982, the number of unemployed had doubled under [Thatcher's] watch, as had the inflation rate. She had tried to take on one of the most powerful unions in the country, the coal miners, and had failed. After three years in office, Thatcher saw her personal approval rating drop to only 25 percent . . . .\\" But then came the Falklands war. On page 170, Klein writes: \\"From a military standpoint, the eleven-week battle appears to have almost no historical significance. Overlooked, however, was the war's impact on the free-market project, which was enormous: it was the Falklands war that gave Thatcher the political cover she needed to bring a program of radical Capitalist transformation to a Western liberal democracy for the first time.\\" And yes, the Falklands victory did give her strong public support that enabled her to get her proposals enacted, and that support continued for a short while afterwards, until the public had time to experience the full effects of Thatcher's 'reforms' and realize how badly they had been snookered. Norberg deceptively implies that the 'strong public support' was there all along, but it wasn't.       But at least there is some hope.  As we see in the final chapter, there is hope: shock wears off, and some of those who survive have a tendency to trade places with their oppressors, putting the oppressors in jail and  returning their country to the people.    watziznaym@gmail.com

B00005JLPK|5.0|It took me a number of years to finally rent and watch this film. I can only say that it was extremely well done, from the acting to the film score to the sets and the photography. The cast and crew of this movie - especially Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor - deserve enormous praise for creating a film both masterful and compelling, in its story of this brilliant and talented woman. I had read that Ms. Hayek had spent a number of years trying to get this movie made. She did a wonderful job of bringing Frida Kahlo to the silver screen. I cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job of telling Frida's story to the rest of the world. This movie should be required viewing of every studio art major and aspiring artist.

Nothin' sweeps across the mid/late '70's like \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"You Make Lovin' Fun\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\".     This is a wrong-headed swirl of cuts/hits from \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" (1975) \\"Rumours\\" (1977) \\"Tusk\\" (1979) and various so-called rarities. There is no historically true timeline of compostion and no booklet that explains the intrigue of the songs.     The sound is embarrassingly mediocre, the old scratched LPs have a better sense of depth and detail. This CD is for those who pop it in the Toyota and travel back....
0316096199|5.0|The differences between Sebold's memoir and fiction are vast. In \\"Lucky\\" as opposed to \\"The Lovely Bones\\" words are hammered in, staccato and short, understated. I liked both books, but I do have to point out it is as if they were written by different writers. In looking over the reviews people seem to hate one and love the other or vice versa, and I think it's a shame. Lovely Bones is like a poem: dreamy. Lucky is dry and aches like a bad knee. They're both excellent, just different.    Lucky is about Sebold's experience as rape survivor, her eventual court experience, and the sad aftermath of her first two years of college. It's no secret that I've been raped myself and am in litigation regarding it up to my neck so it was interesting to see my own reaction. It's a helpful book to read in regards to coming to terms and being honest regarding rape. It's very grounding.     Sebold's almost obsessional use of detail throughout some parts of the book juxtapose with her complete blanks on other seemingly very important details quite realistically. Her harsh rhythm describes, in many ways, my own blank face when trying to plow through describing to lawyers exactly what happened to me. Certainly a book is a safer place to let loose than a courtroom is, and yet she treats her book like a courtroom, as if everyone is standing in judgment of her, particularly her own self to her own self.     What rang the most truthful was Sebold's masochistic honesty, her seeming wish to drive a stake in every relationship she had had prior to her rape. Likewise, her roommate's rape did the same.     Her sentence-style, syntax, etc, reminded me of Hemingway, each sentence an arrow, pointing to a destination, each point drawn taut and clearly. She hit a bull's eye, no doubt.
B0001WGDX0|3.0|These are Beethoven's 9 Symphonies conducted by Bernstein with Vpo (1977-79 years). There is some persistent. The persistence might be clearly understood, if you compare these with his works of [[ASIN:B00006OA68 Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 1-9; Overtures; Violin Concerto (Limited Edition)]] with NYP (1961-64 years). I think that the persistence is caused by Bernstein's decline, though the decline is helped in Vienna Phil's good performance and the good performance of the excellent song hand in ninth symphony. This complete volume might depend on the listener's preference.

B001E1BNWI|2.0|If you're thinking of buying this because it is a mobile fidelity sound labs master, don't.  Metallica put that on they're website, but MOFI denies any involvement with the records and has asked for that info to be taken down. Besides that, the wonderful oppturnity of having a vinyl with nicely spaced grooves playing at 45 rpms has been wasted because the premaster was ruined with compression and clipping.  And vinyl that has been cut from a loud squashed cd type master has to be cut extra quiet, which destroys the snr and sounds like crap.  So with this, you get five records with crappy quiet tracks filled with clipping and distortion.  Too bad, as the music is very strong.  But at least we have the Guitar Hero III edition, YAY!!!!  BTW, the music is definately 5 stars.  And this box is still good for collectors as there are some tastey goodies that come along with the vinyl.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica has given us reason to forget about the headache that was St. Anger.  Thier ninth studio album, Death Magnetic has returned Metallica to their unique sound and has taken that sound to new heights.  This, decades later from their heydaey, is a wondeful acheivement.  This album is almost as good as the Black Album and Master of Puppets, which are my two favorites.  The music is very powerful and the lyrics are discernable and strong.  Each song is several minutes long too, but they don't grow tiresome.  The first few tracks are very thrash driven power ballads.  Then the highlight of the album, \\"The Day That Never comes\\" brings Metallica's sound, and powerful message of the album together to happy listening.  \\"All Nightmare Long\\" helps propel this album as one of their bests.  And certainly the wordless \\"Sucide and Redemption\\" seals it.  \\"The Judas Kiss\\" and \\"My Apocalypse\\" are suck good rock songs that they could have been the only ones on the album and I still would have bought it.  \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is a welcome and decent song as well.  The wondeful album art and etc. are just the nails in the coffin of what is a great achievement by Metallica, and for the first time since the Black album, I can't stop listening.
0553384775|4.0|The even split between 1-start and 5-star reviews is very telling - you'll either love it or hate it, there seems to be very few in between. In short, the book is an over the top, fast paced, recount of non-stop drug abuse, sex, money laundering schemes, and stock manipulation. About halfway through the book I had to go online to confirm that this is, in fact, a non-fiction work - it reads more like a thriller.<br /><br />If you're looking for stock market know-how, this is not the book that will teach you that, albeit the \\"chop stock\\" machinations on top of which Belfort built his empire are definitely an interesting historical artifact. Instead, this is a great tale of the lifestyle of the \\"rich and dysfunctional\\".<br /><br />If you suspend your sense of reality, it is actually a quiet engaging book. Albeit personally, I am still shell-shocked from the thought that Belfort has lived and survived through all this.

B0017VG69U|5.0|I grew up on the original series. Kirk was my hero as a child. Over the years, with the many, many viewings of these three all-too-short seasons, they began to age and lose some of the vitality they once held. I recently bought the 2nd Season Remastered and I am about 2/3 of the way through viewing it. I am so pleased with it!<br /><br />The clean up of the film, restoring the colors and crispness of the images, together with the recreation of the special effects of the ships, planets, etc., have turned this ancient masterpiece into a modern one. It lives again, and so much fun to watch again. The new special effects really bring it back to life without pulling a George Lucas and over-doing it. They went for making it look like it could have been done back in the late 60's had they not been limited in their budget. In other words, the new special effects are beautiful, exciting, but they do not stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the scenes... they look like they belong, and causes the entire episode to become fresh and new! Many kudos to those involved in making this remastered series.
0792846443|5.0|I saw this movie on TV one night. It had already started, about halfway in, maybe less. I decided to watch a little bit of it, then go to bed. I ended up watching the entire thing and staying awake thinking about it for an hour! I understood the story line and what was happening real quick and found the film (in every aspect) wonderful. The part that really got me was when Annie noticed paul had been getting out of his room, and to keep him from escaping put a block of wood between his ankles and broke his feet with a sledge hammer! It looked so real, and was somehow even grosser than seeing someone get eaten by zombies or ripped up by a predator or alien or dinosaur of whatever. anyway, check out the other reviews, find out what it's all about and, if you think you can manage, watch the movie!

VERY convincing and really realistic.<br /><br />I just want to add to all these comments that there are characters from both Pulp Fiction AND KILL BILL in this movie... lol.<br />NO NOT JUST THE ACTORS.. the characters. If you are a fan of those movies and know even the small part players, you will recognize them once you go through it a few times.. or maybe just watching it once again tonite.. and that really gave me a laugh.<br />To put it together, this movie seems to be set somewhere after pulpfiction and before kill bill.. as far as stories PF would be story one Death proof story two and kill bill story 3.. LOL.<br />Only Quentin would slam us with that strangeness.....<br />Here is a giveaway... The man that one girl stays with when they steal the hot car? Take a look at him. He is also the hospital night guard.. SAME PERSONALITY and same just sick out look on women lol.<br />Yes we all know Beatix (the bride) Kills him by slamming his head into a doorway.. lol.. and we all know that his car is the pussywagon.. but he also has a few other hot cars apparently.. and one of them is about to get stolen by these girls in death proof.  I loved that little segment.<br />There are more though!!! You just have to find them.<br /><br />The 70's look but still Modern 2008 type atmosphere makes you wonder where the heck you are. But its true.. we do repeat fashions and attitudes from the past.. we have all through the 90's and now.. that little addition made me laugh.<br />The ladies have a modern attitude on things and are a bit cocky at times, but it does show WHO would be a survivor and who may NOT.<br /><br />The ending is Quite a surprise.  Prepare yourself for that.<br /><br />Have a nice ride!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|There is no reason to sit and tear this album apart. I read where people complain about the compression, that fact that is re-hash of old material.  The fact of the matter is, this is a d@mn good album...PERIOD!  Old school fans and new school fans should appreciate the fact that this is a true metal album.  So go buy it..its well worth the 10 bucks or so.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|The Nine Master of Mayhem have once again made a Masterpeice.  All Hope Is Gone, has hard hitting fast paced double-bass, riffs that make you want to break stuff, and a melody that can consume you.  Asking questions that everyone should be asking themselves, blunting putting it out their...they deserve another Grammy.  You don't have to growl all the time to make good quality music, and Slipknot has learned this.  Corey, Shawn and Chris actually sing in this album giving it a fuller and more satisfying feel for old and new Maggots alike.  You like hard hitting riffs, devastating drums, vocals that make you want sing, and thinking of things that don't normally come to mind... THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!
0765315246|4.0|I believed I was in for a treat after reading the first three pages and noting Scalzi's storytelling ability.  I was not disappointed.  Scalzi's characters were well-developed and he does an excellent job of blending humor into his tale.  Some of the humor was cutesie, some a little corny, but it was not too bad and it worked with the story.  The way he told the story felt like it was coming from the perspective of an older man. I honestly couldn't wait to see what would happen on the next page.  In this book, he also briefly touched on the moral complexities of war and colonization, but did not delve deeply enough to dampen the mood or affect the entertainment value of the novel.  The only real issue I had was that a couple of times he resorted to the antiquated SF method of explaining the science in the novel - one character explains it as though reading a script.  For example, \\"As you know John, the ship is powered by a black light fusion reactor which operates by ... blah, blah, blah.\\"  This is not a quote from the book, but you get my meaning.  Other than this and a few typos this was a very well-writted novel by Scalzi.
0743290119|1.0|This was a truly terrible book.  The story line was very formulaic, nothing here that hasn't been written in MANY other chick lit books.  The characters are one-dimensional, and the reader is left not liking/relating to any of them.  The author's propensity to fall back on vulgarity and swearing is really pitiful.  I'll never understand why authors feel the need to pepper their manuscripts with cursing and swearing.  It's very distasteful.  I enjoyed \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", but this book was really awful.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.

This is a wonderful novel in it's self and for any true Dune fan or new Dune fan \\"Read this book\\". I love everything about Dune and would not change a thing with any of these novels.

B000009MF7|5.0|Having spent quite a lot of words on Thibaudet/Dutoit ([[ASIN:B0000042EU Jean-Yves Thibaudet - Ravel: Piano Concertos, etc.]]), Collard/Maazel ([[ASIN:B00005NPJP Ravel: Piano Concertos; Pavane pour une infante d&eacute;funte; Jeux d'eau; La valse]]) and Lortie/de Burgos ([[ASIN:B000000AJD Ravel: Piano Concerto for the Left Hand in D major, Piano Concerto in G major; Faure: Ballade, Op. 19]]), I will now, at least try to, be more brief: Here we have one of the most beautiful, pristine and spectacular concerto recordings in the stereo era! How is that possible? Well, looking solely at the line-up, it is a bit surprising: Boulez conducting the Cleveland and London Symphony Orchestras in Ravel. Oh, and then there is Krystian Zimerman as soloist in the Concertos.<br /><br />I believe that last bit explains it all. Through Zimerman's unbelievably imaginative pianism, each and every bit and piece just surpasses itself--which is especially true for Boulez, who for ones gets behind the notes and almost catches fire at times. As a matter of fact, his Valses may well be the most exciting in a very long time. Still, they are makeweight to the Concertos. So, back to Zimerman: Throughout, his technical refinement is at a level where few living pianists can rival him--e.g. the first movement opening figure and cadenza (listen to those trills!), the total pristine naturalness of the second movement angelic melody (this is most likely one of the tracks they play in paradise), and the astounding articulation of the third movement alternate quints and runs; the F-sharp minor transition at 6:15, the articulation of the 'Bolero' section from 8:24, and last but not least the magical three-minute end cadenza at 14:09. Even if the first movement of the G major shows microscopic traces of detachment, the D major belongs in the Idea World.<br /><br />If this wasn't enough, also the DG engineers surpass themselves into one of the best demonstrations of how to record a piano concerto. No flaws whatsoever? Perhaps the pedal noise could have been slightly tidied up in the G major slow movement, and perhaps the low bass could have been somewhat less dominating in the D major. Other than that, no.<br /><br />Ravel's twin Concertos belong to the most rewarding in the repertoire. Zimerman presents the best one-disc coupling. Having said that, my life still wouldn't be complete without Argerich's 1968 G major and Gavrilov's 1978 D major. Oh, you think I forgot the Michelangeli/Gracis in the G major!? No, certainly not, being on the short list of most 'professional' reviewers; and clearly it is good, if perhaps not as good as often suggested--IMHO, Michelangeli completely ruins the flow of melodic beauty in the Adagio assai with those tacky breaking of hands.he pedal noise could have been slightly tidied up in the G major slow movement, and perhaps the low bass could have been somewhat less dominating in the D major.

0688170528|4.0|I read a few of the reviews (not all of them) and didn't see anyone who pointed this out, so just wanted to leave my understanding of the book in case it helps anyone else.... sorry if it's a repeat.    I think the main reason Emily wanted to die was because of Chris. She started feeling more like Chris was her brother and was having difficulty having romantic feelings towards him. She knew that she loved Chris and wouldn't be able to not have him in her life if she continued living. However, she also knew that it would break Chris' heart, and their ability to have any kind of relationship, if she told him that she wasn't 'in' love with him. She figured it would be easier on him to think that she died having the same feelings for him as he had for her, than to know she was alive and, given the choice, would rather just be friends when he loved her with all his heart.    Having said that, I don't think it's necessarily realistic that someone would go to the extreme of committing suicide for this reason. You would think that if she loved Chris that much that in order to spare him pain, she was willing to die, that her feelings for him would be stronger than just that of a brother-sister relationship. And that she would want to be alive so that she could be with him. However, that's just the feeling I get from the book.

B00005JPS8|4.0|While I was waiting for my ticket for Iron-Man, I got to thinking, 'Who actually has heard of Iron-Man before?'. He's not a mainstream hero like Batman or Spidy, he hasen't been to big on the comic book scene, but still, a movie was made. Whats gonna be next, a Green Lantern flick?     The plot of Iron Man is kept semi-simple, portraying Mr. Billionaire Tony Stark as a Middle Eastern hostage, forging a super-soilder suit to escape, then expanding on the idea, which turns into Iron Man. Corperate greed, double-dealing, and press coverups show a diffrent side of superheros that we've never witnessed in movies(this is before Dark Knight). Ditching the famed cookie cutter look at hero's, Iron Man dives a layer deeper into realism for a superhero.   On the down side, having the movie take more time showing the 'Fast Life' of celebraties and less of the actual Iron Man kicking booty made this feel like more a prequal, rather than the first instalment. Seeing the hero in a suit with a tie more than a metal one isen't too heroic, often he'd talk at mawk speed with press, giving sarcastic responises, which is 'chic' I guess, but not needed for a Hero movie. This was more of an orgin story on how the suit was built, and Tony's life, more than him donning his matalick tights. But when they where donned, hell hath no fury, and coolness, than Tony Stark. We need to see more of that.          Just as a side note, has anyone seen the trend right now of Superhero movies and how the baddies are dark versions of themselves? SpiderMan 3 had Venom, a dark suited villian that had exact same powers. The new Hulk featured a bigger, badder, and darker shade of green Hulk as the nemises, now Iron Man features a guy in a big grey body suit with sooped up Iron Man poweres. Is this gonna be the trend now?

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Jack Black, kung-fu fighting, and fat pandas? What could go wrong? Apparently nothing if you have the super-powered productions of Dreamworks helping you. Simply put, Kung-Fu Panda is a funny movie. Jack Black brings his AAA game to star as the loveable loser of the animal kingdom, Po the Panda. Po's handle is to fullfill his uncertain destany to become the worlds greatest fighter, AKA the Dragon Warrior, to banish off the evil master Tai Lung. Dreamworks add signature trademark humor, the type that blew Shrek up, but blending it with Chinese backrounds and props gives Panda it's own, special vibe.     CG animations are amazing, Pixar and Dreamworks alike have expanded their movies by their attention to detail, and it sure does show here. Every portion of every critter's body has been refinished with a fine tooth comb, truly pushing the limits of modern day technology in cinema. Even by a casual glance, it would be hard not to see the exteme textures of the backdrops, characters ect.     Of course, being a chinese Kung-Fu movie, Panda's gotta have a little bit of fight in it, right? Just lika Jacki Chan movie, there are interlocked, coriographed bad-ass fighting scenes. But since this is animation, Dreamworks takes Panda to a much grander scale of fighting by outragious stunts that could only be portrayed in the animated realm.     Panda is the most fun I've had with any fick this year(next to Batman, of course), Panda has what it takes to be a great franchise, possibly even Shrek scaled.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Rather than review this amazing modern Noir...I just want to say..BUY this new version...it looks fabulous and the bonus features are  PLENTIFUL and very meaty with content and the good  news is they ALSO have brought over the features from the first release allowing all of us to dump that one and that isn't always the case.  They also have a nearly 1  hr  TV  movie/pilot called LA CONFIDENTIAL starring Keifer Sutherland which is fun.  There is also a bonus CD disc of music which is icing on the cake.  I just spent a few hours watching all the bonus features and will absolutely watch them again ( a rarity) and as I  said..the movie never  looked better..I've only checked out a bit of the commentary which has a staggering  number of contributors and should make another viewing  of the movie with it running a fun trip indeed.  WB  does  it well when they re-issue and not just with the sexy new cover image  ..this baby got a complete overhaul...    enjoy!
B00005JPO1|3.0|If you tried to revieve a series such as Indiana Jones, would you go back to your roots of sucess from before, or attempt to reinvent the franchise, and appeal to the younger generation? Fight the Nazies, or the Soviets? Keep Harrison, or start on after a younger version? I'd initially go for whatever the head hanchos of Lucas and Speilburg suggest, but after this outing of Jones, I might reconsider.      Indy always showed his fans love with classic 'Bang-Bang' action chases, firefights and daring escapes of the lean-mean Dr. Jones in his 20's, which exactly is what happens when he stays solo on his fourth outing. But when Indy's long lost lover Maryann Ravenwood comes by to hand out motherly advice during fighting, arguing over family jibberish while melting into quicksand, and introducing a son, it soon felt like a better title would be Indiana Jones and his Loser Family. I always loved how Indiana could pull of death defying stunts that where edgy on the line of unbelivable, but the infamous 'Atomic Fridge' and 'Tarzan' scenes with the whole basis of the film trying to hunt down ET's grandpa's noggin, Crystal Skull  winds up as a washed up, mainstream sell-out.      Solo efforts by Harrison are total renditions of the fun that I remember from traditional Indian Jones. But with family ties, tons of CG, and a throwback plot keeps me wishing Crystal Skull was far from cannon of the series.
B00004U8JV|2.0|One of my biggest complaints with this movie was the tagline \\"Something has survived.\\" So? Why wouldn't something have survived? As I recall at the end of Jurassic Park everyone just evacuates the island and leaves the dinosaurs to themselves so of course something has survived. Now if you read the book where they bomb the island back to the stone age (no pun intended) it would make sense that everything should have been dead. Then they go on to tell us that it was based on Michael Crichton's book. Could someone please tell me which parts? (spoilers) First of all the opening scene where the girl gets attacked by the compys is actually the beginning to the FIRST book. What was up with that? Then when we get into the plot the ONLY character that even remotely resembled his character from the book was Ian Malcolm. The rest of the characters were either one character's name transplanted onto another's personality or completely made up for the movie such as the ENTIRE expedition that was attempting to capture live dinosaurs. Then at the end that whole T-Rex rampage through town, what moron thought that would be a good idea? Another element that never happend in the book. O.K. I understand that movies are basically never exactly like the book, but shouldn't there have been at least ONE scene from the book included in the movie? The only one I can remember is the T-Rexs kicking the trailers off the cliff and the kicking of the trailers was the only thing about that scene that was correct nothing else. One last question: What was the high hide hanging from?

0060245867|5.0|This is the first offering of a wonderfully delightful series of like stories for children.  If You Give a Mouse A Cookie by Laura Joffe Numeroff and illustrated by Felicia Bond tell the story, and the problems you might run into, if you should happen to give a overly active and demanding mouse a cookie.  The story begins with a young boy innocently setting by his sidewalk in front of his house.  A hungry mouse comes along and the problems begin.<br /><br />This is a progressive type of tale, where one act of generosity keeps growing and growing.  \\"If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.  When you give him milk, he'll probably ask you for a straw.  When you give him a straw, he will ask.........\\" And it goes on and on and on until the poor kid pretty well has a completely trashed house and is exhausted trying to fulfill the escalating requests and the subsequent mess the requests ultimately cause.  A pushy mouse and cookies, we find, are not a good combination!<br /><br />The text is delightfully simple and keeps you turning the pages, page after page.  You actually find you self wanting to see what the little rodent is going to ask for next.  The story is simple and there is no bang, bang, crash crunch plot nor ending.  The only problem I find in this aspect is that in this day and age, I find some children (and even more adults), who have the attention span of ferrets on coffee and if the story is in the least bit mellow, their minds simply cannot track.  This is a minor problem though, if it is indeed a problem.<br /><br />The art work by Felicia Bond is quite well done and goes perfectly with the text.  The pictures are simple to understand, cute and quite eye catching.  I liked them.<br /><br />This is one of in a series of books by this team.  Others include If you give a Moose a Muffin, If you give a Pig a Pancake, If you take a Mouse to the Movies, If you take a Mouse to School and If you give a Pig a Party.  All are as well done.  I have noted in reading this book and others in the series that the kids love them and will always ask for repeat readings.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksbook and others in the series that the kids love them and will always ask for repeat readings.

0312360266|3.0|I\\"m a huge vampire fan and really enjoy reading how teen books handle it.  This book is NOT like Twilight so if that is what you're looking for, look else were.  This book is something that puts a new twist on the undead, which I found a little refreshing.  I think Zoey is a strong female character who I falls victim of making teenage mistakes while tackling adult problems.  The book really hammers the idea of loyalty alot which is a strength of the book.    The weakness for me (and for ALL of the books so far) is the pacing, way, way to fast. They span only a few days in the books and feels rushed at times where taking her time would be good.  They do better in the next book, but I feel that there are characters who are talked about (like Zoey's sister) that I would have liked to see some exchange, and slow down the book. It would not suffered from another 150 pages in my opinion.  But like I said this is how all the books suffer.    Otherwise very engaging story and I like the whole undead-dead idea of vampires.

B00003CXAT|5.0|In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen. The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.
B001D25MNE|4.0|\\"Brotherhood\\", or better titled \\"Singles 93-03 Part 1 1/2\\" is more of the same things any fan of The Chemical Brothers already owns.  There are 7 songs from the \\"Singles\\" album that are repeated on the first disc of \\"Brotherhood\\", so you could conceivable own them 3 times.  With so many good songs to choose from (and knowing what you've already recycled once), you'd think the track selection would have been better.  A bit disappointing.  I will also agree with torley.com that the order of them doesn't necessarily fit well.     The only reason to buy the box is for the \\"Electronic Battle Weapons 1-10\\", which is a long time coming for some of the tracks.  A lot of these tracks you already own too as they've showed up on a few of the past LPs.  But no matter, it's nice to have them in their original format.      Bottom line, buy the box for the \\"Electronic Battle Weapons 1-10\\" or go buy the \\"Singles 93-03\\" and get a better collection...

B00192KCQ0|5.0|When they hit their 30s, the members of Metallica started trying to be things that they were not. Kirk Hammett (rhymes with jam it) believed the hype from unskilled grunge hacks that guitar solos were uncool, Lars Ulrich tried to add too much art to his relentless attack, and James Hetfield thought it would be a good idea to add feelings to his intelligent misanthropy. Now that middle age has set in, Metallica are suddenly young again, but have added crucial experience to their greatest youthful strengths.<br /><br />Death Magnetic is surely an improvement over St. Anger, which was a low point but maligned a bit unfairly by fans. (I loved that album at first because it was different than Load and ReLoad, and gave it a glowing review in this forum, which earned me a fair amount of static. Regardless, St. Anger lacked long-term staying power.) If only Metallica could get an album out more than once every five years, occasional duds could be buried by the band's core long-term brilliance. Death Magnetic shows Metallica roaring back to life, not unlike a slumbering beast reawakening after an unhappy therapy session. Everyone is back to their core strengths, and \\"new\\" bassist Robert Trujillo has been allowed to make a full contribution to the sound (more so than poor old Jason Newsted) and seems to have kicked a spark into the band.<br /><br />This album most reminds me of ...And Justice for All, with super-sized songs that justify their length with jaw-dropping sonic structures and relentless musical mastery. The only real misstep here is \\"The Unforgiven III\\" which finally nails the coffin shut on a once-great idea. Earlier in the album, the dramatic power balladry of \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" is much more rewarding for both the band and the listener. Other highpoints include the surprisingly swinging \\"Cyanide\\" and the absolutely fascinating ten-minute instrumental epic \\"Suicide and Redemption.\\"<br /><br />After a lot of iffy years, Metallica are back on top of the heap that they created. Instead of stretching for empathy, they're once again striking fear into the hearts of posers and haters. And if you're one of those so-called \\"fans\\" who hates the modern Metallica for not sounding exactly like they did 22 years ago, go crawl back into whatever malfunctioning time machine you just fell out of.

0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my nephews, 3 and 7, and they love it.  Even though their (good) parents won't let them watch Star Wars yet, they love being introduced to all these characters through this book.     The pop-ups are intricate and amazing. The multiple layers within layers on just one page is evidenced by the thickness of this book. The pop-ups cascade out to reveal a surprising number of characters from the original trilogy. Luke's boyhood friend Wedge is even in there.      The artwork is true art - reproductions of watercolor. The pop-ups aren't always true to form (the Death Star looks kind of like a squashed ping pong ball) but come on - it's a pop-up!     Great introductory Star Wars brainwashing. Highly recommended.

B0010X745K|5.0|I am not sure when it became \\"cool\\" to bash Stephen King, but most of the reviews here that do are shallow and contrite.  Much like the overlooked Dreamcatcher, The Mist takes the viewer on a thrill ride packed with characters who represent the extremes in everyday life.  But isn't that what you are supposed to do in a film about the microcosm of society pressed into two hours?  I am not going to give any simple recap of the film, because reviews like that are useless.  Here's what you need to know...if you like creepy, gut-wrenching horror that packs an intelligent and unapologetic punch, then The Mist is right up your alley.  This is the fun, classic King at his best (a la Creep Show).  There were two items that bothered me about the film, however.  The \\"creature\\" too similar to the ones from Dreamcatcher....and, if we're going to use a \\"parallel dimension\\" as the cause for the creatures...I think more creativity could have gone into their design.  That being said, this movie is clearly in my top ten horror films of all time list.  Highly Recommended!!!
0307455874|4.0|This is an analysis by chapter of remarks made by Barack Obama.  Senator Obama believes that big Government is the answer to everything.  Some highly regarded past presidents disagree with him. Thomas Jefferson said \\"My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government\\".  President Reagan said \\"Government isn't the solution it is the problem!\\"    Republicans & Democrats.  [18]  Obama complains that Alan Keyes, who never lived in Illinois, ran against him for the Illinois U.S. Senate seat.  However, Obama had no such complaints regarding Hillary Clinton doing the same thing in New York.  Only Hillary pushed aside a real New Yorker from the same party-Nita Lowey.  At least Alan Keyes did not pressure anyone from his own party to stand aside.  [23] Obama falls into the trap of confusing tax rates with tax revenues.  President Kennedy proved that by lowering artificially high tax rates, the economy would grow and the treasury would take in far greater tax revenues.  [24] \\"Liberals are more often grounded in reason and fact\\".  Liberals take the view that all we need is larger Government and we can solve anything.  Conservatives take the view that there is a need for limited Government to control excesses committed by Unions, Businesses and rogue nations but that Government should promote policies that stimulate the economy rather than shrink it.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are controlled by Clinton appointees who have salaries + Bonuses in the tens of millions of dollars.  Is it good reason to reward liberal political supporters with little business experience to Quasi Governmental institutions only to have them turn a blind eye to their excesses?  Is it good reason for Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT) and Representative Barney Frank (D-MA) to fight the Bush Administration on Wall Street reform and then blame the president when the Democrats' house of cards collapses?  Franklin Raines was Clinton's White House Budget Director.  Clinton appointed him as the CEO of Fannie Mae where in 6 years he received $90 Million Dollars.  He received excessive bonuses by cooking the books for Fannie Mae.  It was this democrat's dishonest actions the led to the collapse of Fannie Mae.   With a $90 Million largess he had more than enough to spread the wealth around as he did to his favorite Democrat senators.  His largest contribution went to Chris Dodd and the second largest to Barack Obama.  Jim Johnson was the Vice Chair of Fannie Mae.  He headed up Obama's Vice President Selection Committee.  Now that is what I call Party loyalty.    [35] Barack Obama is being disingenuous when he talks about the inequities of the Electoral College.  He makes the specious argument that the Electoral College favors Republicans over Democrats.  He gives the California Wyoming example. Now lets compare two Republican senators from Texas representing a population of 23,507,783 whose votes equal the votes of two Democrat senators from Delaware representing a population of 853,476.  Obama got his law degree from Harvard and Con Law is a requirement for all law students.  Obama knows very well that the Electoral College was set up to give the small states a greater voice.  It had nothing to do with partisan politics.  Obams's contention is purposely false. He deliberately and dishonestly misrepresented the issue.  Hillary Clinton also made the same specious argument.   If we were to eliminate senatorial representation in the Electoral College count the twelve largest States in terms of population would benefit at the expense of the 38 smaller states.  Would Joe Biden agree to strip Delaware of 2/3 of its Electoral College votes while California would only lose 3 ½%?  I don't think so.  And Barack Obama is for the little guy?  [36] Obama talks about conservatives looseness with the facts.  When it comes to the the Clintons there is no need to be loose with facts.  They are the most corrupt political couple in the history of American politics making Juan and Eva Peron look like upstanding citizens.  Ken Starr's report was 100% factual.  Democrats were horrified by the sleaziness of the Clintons in the Starr report and even their most loyal sycophants from the press (such as George Stephanopoulos) could not defend them.  [37] He talks about financing \\"tax cuts for the wealthy\\".  This is nothing more than a tired socialist class warfare argument.  The truth is that the top 5% pay 57% of the taxes.  They pay more taxes than the remaining 95% of the country.  The bottom 50% pay 3% of the taxes.  Obama's argument that the rich are avoiding taxes is patently false.  Time after time cutting tax rates for the rich have resulted in increased tax payments from the rich.  How can this be?  It is easy. Government is a drag on our economy and the rich invest in the growth of our economy.  A small tax slice from the huge economic pie is greater than a large tax slice from a small economic pie.  When will liberals get with the program and realize that tax rates are not the issue it is tax revenues!  Also, remember the famous words of Thomas Jefferson \\"The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not.\\"    Our Constitution  [90] Obama endorses Joseph Breyer's interpretation of the constitution.  That it is a living document.  The bad thing about a living document is that it can be changed to whatever the majority justices want it to be.  This is why it is so important to have conservative Justices who want to hold the constitution to the original meaning set forth by Washington Adams, Jefferson, Monroe and the other signers.  We don't need liberals turning the constitution on its head.     [91-92] Obama says \\"We are free to assert our own values unencumbered by fidelity to the stodgy traditions of a distant past\\".  He is referring to our founding fathers.  Its nice to know the high esteem Obama holds for the creators of the U.S. Constitution.Our founding fathers were advocates for a free capitalist society, which conflicts with Obama's dream of a Socialist Utopia where Rhodes Scholar liberals will lead this country and dictate what is good for the intellectually inferior masses.  Thomas Jefferson wanted to preserve the constitution and did not want to make it a living document as Obama so desperately desires.  Jefferson said \\"I do then, with sincere zeal, wish an inviolable preservation of our present federal Constitution, according to the true sense in which it was adopted by the States\\".    Politics  [103]  Obama criticizes the corruption  of gerrymandering and in the process plagiarizes Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger when he says \\"voters no longer choose their representatives; instead representatives choose their voters\\".  But who is blocking this redistricting reform.  Why none other than the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who won't allow this to happen on her watch at the Congressional level.  However Pelosi is immune from recall because she hails from San Francisco where Che Guevara is revered as a \\"comrade in arms\\" and Hillary Clinton is regarded as a right-winger.  Only in San Francisco (and Menlo Park) would Hillary Clinton be considered a right-winger.  [116] More class warfare.  Barack asserts that Business subverts the very idea of democracy and union workers are its essence.  Actually both are the essence of our society.  But Obama wants to engage in the politics of divisiveness.  This is another one of Obama's tired socialist arguments.      Opportunity  [151] \\"But Hamilton understood that only through the liberation of capital from local landed interests could America tap into its most powerful resource-namely the energy and enterprise of the American people\\".  As the first Secretary of the treasury he did not liberate money unless you are referring to the Whiskey Tax- a measure that Ted Kennedy would have vehemently opposed had he lived in that era.  Obama has a romanticized albeit inaccurate recollection of Hamilton's role as Secretary of the Treasury.    [154] Obama refers to Social Security as \\"the centerpiece of the new welfare state\\".  Social Security is a safety net in our enlightened Capitalist State.  Obama wants a welfare State.  Come November the voters will decide whether our great country will be a Welfare State or an enlightened Capitalist State.  [155] \\"FDR saving Capitalism from itself\\".  Admittedly FDR introduced some much needed controls.  He also betrayed the dream of our founding fathers by increasing the role of the Federal Government beyond their wildest dreams.  This is why in 50 years the PRC will be the greatest Capitalist Country in the World and the USA will go the way of the United Kingdom unless the American People resoundingly reject Obama's Utopian Socialist dream.  [157]  Obama gives Clinton credit for welfare reform.  This is rewriting history as Dick Morris would say.  The 1994 mid-term elections gave the Democrats the boot and swept in Newt Gingrich and a Republican House and Senate.  It was the Gingrich revolution that introduced Welfare reform.  Clinton vetoed the legislation 3 times before finally giving into pressure from the American Public.  This was Newt Gingrich's work-not Bill Clinton's.  Bill Clinton just took credit for what Newt Gingrich did.  [166]  Obama rightfully argues for University research.  This should happen with 2 conditions.  These are 1) No University gets a single dime of federal money until it has a fully accredited ROTC program with students enrolled, and 2) Universities can have no professors favoring one political party over the other in the classroom.  Doing so would result in immediate dismissal from the University regardless of tenure.  I resent my tax dollars being used to fund Universities' propaganda machines that embellish or lie about the virtues of the Democratic Party while viciously slandering the Republican Party.  [179]  Obama argues against the privatization of SocialSecurity because the average investor does not have the requisite knowledge to make wise investment decisions.  No argument there.  But privatized retirement investment programs have been a resounding success.  One has to look no further than CALPERS.  The social security system should use the CALPERS paradigm now!  Social Security is a failure because the Politicians siphon money from it to trim the budget deficit.  Social Security is going broke because of Congress.    [181] Wage Insurance.  Obama proposes that when one is laid off from a job and has to take a lower paying job that for a period of 2 years that person would get half the difference in the wages.  Suppose a lawyer making $400,000 a year is laid off by a Silicon Valley law firm for poor job performance and takes a job with the Northern California Chapter of the ACLU for $100,000/year.  Under Obama's plan average workers making $50,000 a year would collectively subsidize this lawyer to the tune of $150,000 a year for the next two years.  Now that's what I call looking out for the little guy.  [193] \\"That once your drapes cost more than the average American's yearly salary, then you can afford to pay a bit more in taxes\\".  This requires no further comment.    Faith  [214] \\"Our failure as progressives\\".  For the uninitiated \\"progressives\\" is a code word for \\"Socialists\\" because it is more palatable.  \\"Someone`s praying, Lord, Kumbaya.\\"    Race  [261] Barack Obama said that he will stand with Arab Americans should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.  As well he should.  Arab Americans are Americans.  However, should Arab Americans be responsible for that shift, such as a successful terrorist attack within our borders by Arab Americans then our leaders would need to reevaluate our national security measures-and that includes increase surveillance over the groups most likely to commit further terrorist attacks based on vetted intelligence and past misdeeds by terrorist groups.  Since 9/11 the despised Bush Administration has thwarted countless attempts of terrorism against the United States including the George Washington and Brooklyn Bridges.  Many of these failed attempts had involvement from Arab Americans.  It would be unfair to indict a whole community for the actions of a few but still some additional security measures would need to be put in place should there be another successful terrorist attack within our borders.  Justice Robert Jackson once said \\"The constitution is not a suicide Pact.\\"- much to the dismay of the ACLU.    The World beyond our borders.  [276] Obama states that the Indonesian \\"Army targeted not just guerillas but civilians for swift retribution, murder, rape, villages set afire.  And throughout the seventies and eighties all this was done with the knowledge, if not outright approval of U.S. Administrations\\".  This is a very serious accusation.  But does Obama offer any proof this was done with the approval of our Government?  No he did not!  Obama's actions are reckless and irresponsible.  He also demonstrates a bias against the United States - not an admirable trait for someone running for President.    [278] \\"In a 2003 poll most Indonesians had a higher opinion of Osama Bin Laden than they did of George W. Bush\\".  He should have added American liberals to that statement.    [279] Obama accuses the US Government of encouraging \\"tyranny, corruption, and environmental degradation when it served our interests\\".  Not true.  Our Government has supported Capitalist regimes over Communist ones.  In many instances these regimes did not live up to our hopes and expectations.  But our Government never encouraged the bad behavior that Obama accuses it of.  We wanted those regimes to be like the US model.  What he says just does not ring true and he knows it.  [283] \\"Republican Senate Leader Henry Cabot Lodge considered the League of Nations and the very concept of International Law as an encroachment on American Sovereignty, a foolish constraint on America's ability to impose its will around the world.\\"  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Henry Cabot Lodge said in his 12August 1919 speech addressed to President Wilson \\"We would not have our politics distracted and embittered by the dissensions of other lands.  We would not have our country's vigor exhausted or her moral force abated, by everlasting meddling and muddling in every quarrel, great and small, which afflicts the world\\". Does that sound like Henry Cabot Lodge wanting to impose America's will around the world? Again Obama makes a knowingly false accusation.  Henry Cabot Lodge's very own words refutes Obama's contention.  [290] \\"Clinton himself understood that globalization involved not only new economic challenges but also new security challenges\\".  Bill Clinton understood and did nothing about security challenges.  During the Clinton presidency Al Qaeda had repeated terrorist attacks against the United States interests including the bombing of the Khobar towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996 where 19 USAF personnel were murdered; the bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam; and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000.  The Sudanese Government offered to turn Osama Bin Laden over the United States but Clinton balked.  Madeleine Albright allegedly said \\"We can't do that Muslims will hate us.\\"  Which gives an insight to the Clinton's administration's view of Muslims.  The Clinton administration felt that Muslims supported terrorism.  The Bush Administration knew better.  The Bush Administration knew that most Muslims are basically good people who abhor the terrorist tactics of Al Qaeda.  The surge in Iraq worked partly because of the Bush Administration's resolve and partly because the majority of Muslims supported the U.S. troops over the Al Qaeda terrorists.  Harry Reid and Barack Obama wanted the surge to fail because the destruction of an Arab country was a small price to pay for the Democrats to gain power.  Bill Clinton's feckless abrogation of his duties as Commander in Chief to protect our country will go down as a shameful chapter in American History.  Clinton's personality cannot make up for his lack of courage as Commander in Chief.  [293] \\"The notion that we could preemptively remove Governments not to our liking was now the Bush Doctrine.\\"  Obviously, Obama does not know what the Bush doctrine is because on page 308 he unknowingly regurgitates it.  He said \\"I would also argue that we have the right to take unilateral military action to eliminate a threat to our national security\\".  That is the Bush Doctrine.   [305] The integration of Germany and Japan into a world system of liberal democracies.\\"  There is no such thing as a democracy in modern times.  Most Governments have a representative or Republican form of Government, also known as a democratic republic.  Some, like Cuba and North Korea have no representation at all.  It is usually helpful for a presidential candidate to understand the Government structures of the countries with whom he desires to conduct foreign policy.   [307] \\"The United States won the cold war not simply because it outgunned the Soviet Union but because American values held sway in the court of International Public Opinion\\".  Bull Feathers!  The U.S. won the cold war because Ronald Reagan knew that our Robust Capitalist economy was far stronger than Russia's Socialist economy (much to the dismay of liberals) and he engaged in an economic war that bankrupted Russia.  Can we afford to have someone as president who has as much understanding of our adversaries as Jimmy Carter?  [315] Obama states that \\"any global system built in America's image can alleviate misery in poorer countries.\\"  President Bush did exactly that in Iraq and was roundly criticized by Obama and much of Democratic Party for doing so.     If the Democratic Party wants to be a viable entity in the 21st century it most jettison the \\"Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party\\" and let the BlueDogs take over.  Time and again the Democrats had proven leaders such as Scoop Jackson, David Boren, Sam Nunn, Zell Miller, and Joseph Lieberman who were ready for prime time.  But did they ever get the presidential nomination.  The answer is a deafening No!  Instead they offer up flaccid socialist ideologues who resonate with the moveon.org crowd.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini-series is awesome! Well acted, historically correct, I recommend it to all early american history buffs.
B000ZN802W|1.0|Coleridge taught us that to enjoy fiction, we need to have a \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\".  But \\"Into the Wild\\" is supposed to be a \\"true\\" story: it should hang together (within the liberties required to compress years of plot into a couple of hours).  This story does not do that.  Krakauer and Sean Penn give us an inconsistent romanticization of a life and a death that make no sense.  The viewer, like the family member of an alcoholic, starts in denial.  When Chris McCandless buys rice, a book on native plants a 22 rifle and cartridges, we don't realize that that was ALL he took with him on his trek to the coast (no compass, no map, nothing to eat besides rice, no plan for what happens after he reaches the ocean).  Penn & Krakauer try to make this a heroic tragedy.  That just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I  enjoyed the movie until McCandless settles down in an abandoned bus to starve to death because he realizes he cannot get back across a raging river.  At that point I found myself asking questions like \\"How did the bus get there? Did it ford the raging river and climb the fifty foot bank, or did it perhaps come by the road?  Why isn't this explorer following the bus tracks?\\"  When I looked into the \\"facts\\" of the story I was left with the uncomfortable feeling that Chris McCandless was a pathetic -- not a tragic -- figure, probably mentally ill, who ran off into the wilderness and died.  My heart goes out to the McCandless family who have their loss portrayed for the masses but not before Penn has tarred their reputation and blamed them for Chris's problems (as nearly as I can tell from the internet accounts, the horrid parents are Penn's adaptation): as mental health professionals will tell you, mental illness is not the parent's fault.<br /><br />Although the cinematography is great (the scenery is stunning) and much of the acting is first rate, my lasting impression of the movie is one of being in very poor taste.  I feel like I owe the McCandless family an apology for having watched it.or having watched it.
B001EN71HC|5.0|It's groovy baby to have nice groovy Blu Ray HD transfers of these films,but where's the extra Mojo? The extras are pretty much identical to the standard DVD's but it's still Austin Powers,yeah baby!!!
B000LPS3B2|5.0|Ok, so I hate most horror flicks. Why? Because they are not scary. I watch horror movies to laugh at the cheesy special effects. But the original Shutter (NOT the lamest of lame remake with the guy from Dawson's Creek) actually creeped me out a little. And isn't that why we have horror movies-to be scared? So 5 stars and 2 thumbs up for the only film that has ever managed to make me nervous when the lights went out.
078322933X|4.0|Fear is a sort-of Fatal Attraction type thriller, though is not the classic that Fatal Attraction has become.  Fear, however, is quite effective for what it is and though nothing about it is top-rate as far as a great Thriller goes, the combined package of what Fear offers still grabs hold of you and pulls you in for the ride.<br /><br />David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) catches the eye of Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) and the pair hook up for an evening together after leaving a dance club.  Nicole is practically shocked when the man she gets to know is much more than meets the eye, and her dreams seem to be coming true when she thinks she has found the perfect guy.  The first half of Fear sets up a love story that is actually enjoyable to watch, as both David and Nicole fall for each other.  I never felt the love story was ever very cheesy, especially when the \\"roller coaster experience\\" is quite original.  David finally meets Nicole's family, and everyone is amazed at this perfect, handsome gentlemen.  Everyone except Nicole's father, Steve (William Peterson) who just doesn't buy into it.<br /><br />All good things must come to an end....if it's too good to be true....etc etc...and here we go...David comes by Nicole's school on a typical afternoon to pick her up and witnesses her friend Gary hugging her.  The kind and gentle David we thought we knew is suddenly transformed into a raging beast, knocking Gary to the ground and kicking the crap out of him.  Smart Nicole thankfully doesn't want anything to do with David again.  Regretting his mistake, David apologizes til it wears down Nicole.  She gives David another chance, meanwhile outraging Steve.  Thus begins the war between Steve and David, and eventually brining the enitre family into the mix.<br /><br />The last half of Fear is, well, Fear.  The thrills and suspense begin.  The final setting of the film is at the Walker residence, where David and his buddies won't rest until they bust inside and do the damage.  Overall, it's a predictable finale, but the bits and pieces getting there are always fun and contain some surprise thrills.<br /><br />You might feel silly when you step out of the spotlight about Fear, cause its certainly not a masterpiece but its a fun ride nevertheless that effectively entertains.  If you're looking for a good teenager love story that isn't cheesy follwed by a sudden turn for the worst in terms of thrills, Fear is worth checking out.<br /><br />Acting - 3.5<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Story - 3.5<br />Suspense - 4<br />Overall - 4Overall, it's a predictable finale, but the bits and pieces getting there are always fun and contain some surprise thrills.<br /><br />You might feel silly when you step out of the spotlight about Fear, cause its certainly not a masterpiece but its a fun ride nevertheless that effectively entertains.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|I had to sweep at least 3 or 4 times to pick up everything on the floor.  After charging about 10 times, the battery no longer charged.  Lousy quality.  I threw it in the trash can last week.  My vacuum cleaner does a much better job on both carpet and hardwood floor.  It's very light, but most vacuum cleaners have wheels, it's really not that bad.  Don't trust what you see in the TV commercials.
B0006GANOQ|4.0|Speed is kind of like Die Hard on wheels.  In both films there is a hostage situation, while a madman demands money or else people are going to die.  The cast, acting, dialouge and story are not as sharp in Speed as Die Hard IMHO, but what makes Speed uniqely different is that the entire movie isn't focused into a single structure.  Instead, we are on a Los Angeles public bus that cannot travel under 50 mph or else the bomb underneath will detonate.  The stage is therefore set for non-stop speeding thrills and suspense.<br /><br />The movie has 3 main stages.  The majority of the film is the bus, but before that begins the film starts off immediately with an introduction to our villain Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), an ex-cop who places a bomb in a tower elevator and the L.A. officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) sent to neautralize the bomb and rescue the hostages caught in the elevator.  While it does provide the film with an instant scene of suspense, it's nearly 30 minutes in length and after a few viewings of Speed, I am more than ready for our bus scene.<br /><br />The next hour of the film is the bus.  Payne has planted a bomb underneath, and racing down the L.A. freeway comes the bus, and anything in its path better be ready to duck, jump, or get run over.  An unfortunate accident on board places an every day young woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) in the driver's seat, while officer Jack jumps on board to do his best to control the situation.  But Payne is one smart bombmaker, and almost every scenario is pre-thought out leaving Jack with little time to come up with a plan.  Meanwhile the bus has until 11am, or Payne receives his money, before it blows.<br /><br />The final scene is a little unnecessary but set up to take control of our villain once and for all.  This scene takes place on the subway, in an abondoned subway car that is speeding out of control.  After a wild ride for an hour or so on the bus, the subway scene is little exciting, and like I said, feels like it was thrown in the mix just to wrap things up.<br /><br />Overall, Speed succeeds by providing great action and thrills that almost never let up.  There are moments when I felt I was one of those every day passengers on that bus.  But then when I listen to dialouge and some rough acting by the majority of the supporting cast, I remember its just a movie.  Nevertheless, Speed is original and effective for what it is.  It is a classic in its own right.<br /><br />Acting - 3.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 4own in the mix just to wrap things up.

031606792X|1.0|Dear Ms. Meyer, I want my money back!  (This review has one star because Amazon would not allow me to give it none...yes, I feel that cheated.)    A friend of mine suggested this book series and loaned me the first two.  I blitzed through them immediately (two days), enthralled and not wanting to put them down.  I bought the next two convinced they were building to some wonderful classic ending: a confrontation of good versus evil where Bella's humanity (that which has made her so lovable and engaging but she views as flawed and unworthy) becomes the catalyst to overcome all obstacles, natural or supernatural, for the one she loves.  Insteed we get a made-for-TV-style story which is sloppy, condescending and frankly, stupid.      What is really angering too is that the author makes thought-provoking parallels throughout the first three books by comparing the Bella/Edward love story to Romeo and Juliet, and Wuthering Heights but then what does she give us in the end...a parallel to Rosemary's Baby?!?  Ugh.      There were so many wonderful things Bella and readers could have pulled out of this story that Ms. Meyer completely loses sight of: messages about the healing power of love; what does and doesn't determine the value of a soul; the poison of prejuduice; and the reality that beauty is truly more than skin deep.  In the end she wanders into a horror-esque tale competely forgetting that the book's \\"soul\\" pivoted on the concept of romantic love.      I keep hoping that this book is some horrible mistake.  Kind of like it is really a nightmare what Bella wakes up from after making love to Edward the first night on their honeymoon (after all she has a ton of nightmares...)  Inatead the story would build to an ending where she uses her human frailties and overwhelming love to barter with a Higher Power for the soul of her beloved and a long-lasting human life together.  Now that would be a gratifying ending...one that proves that love and forgiveness conquers all.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|The Latest work by JUDAS PRIEST is superb in terms of the vocals, the music, and the packaging.It is clearly a concept album that in my view has only one similar album that you can compare it with, which was done by a band in a different genre ( YES, the album I have in mind is TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS).The points in common are that you have Unique vocalists, and musicians who are masters at what they play. Anyway, jettison the comparison.  JUDAS PRIEST stand alone in the Hard rock world as being brilliant musicians, and consistently hard workers who have fans that stick to the PRIEST like few band fans do. In my view there are few bands that can deserve that kind of loyalty in hard rock. And JUDAS PRIEST have produced a work that shows they can play extremely, extraordinarily well.There is not a weak track on the album.   The Package I bought was the the \\"middle\\" edition, where the Book has the CDs in the front ( disc 1 ) and in the back ( disc 2). The Book is very well done. Just a word of caution, if you have either sweaty hands at the time you look at the book, or someone who wants to look at this book with any kind of gunk on their hands, try and avoid it: this is a collectors book that needs careful handling. If you can afford the Vinyl edition ( as in Vinyl record version) then you should buy that. Whilst I am tremendously happy with the NOSTRADAMUS work, I am also happy with the edition I bought. This is a great year for Rock releases, and I do mean in the classic, best quality sense.
B00007G1ZC|4.0|It always amazes me that folks always wax poetic about Akira Kurosawa and never seem to get past the director to get to the story.     Now I have to admit that I'm really into Japanese cinema, but this is a very artsy movie.  If you are looking for Yojimbo, bypass this.  This is not that kind of movie.  This is the kind of movie that someone with a liberal arts degree who enjoys visiting art museums might enjoy.  It is a bunch of increasing dark vignettes with a happy one at the end.      The first involves a 10 year old boy who sees a marriage procession who then is kicked out by mother and given a tanto (knife) and told that he has to kill himself.  Beautiful scenery as he heads into the field to beg for his life.  We don't (thankfully) see the outcome.  This was one of the happier vignettes.    We move on to a vignette that has a sick little boy talking to the personification of some peach trees that were callously cut down by his family.  While truly sad, this was a happy bed of roses compared to most of the rest.    The one about Mt. Fuji was just about as dark as dark gets, except maybe the one about the human watching the demons in hell,  Yea, this one involves 6 exploding Nuclear Power plants, Mt Fuji blowing up, and everyone in Japan jumping off a cliff or being overcome by colorful radioactive gas.  All the while the guy who caused it all lovingly describing just how bad, bad will get.  The Demons in Hell one seems to be a follow on with mutated flowers, devils whose rank is determined by the number of horns on their heads.  Good idea on the horns. I have no idea how many chili dogs it took to have these nightmares.     Their was a fairly happy one with a Japanese painter entering a Van Gogh painting, and the last one hearkens back to the Willoby episode from Outer Limits.  The Waterwheel village was truly the only really happy story in the bunch.  But then, if you like happy stories you probably are not watching Japanese movies.     Let's get real.  Mostpeople will not like this not because of the filming which is excellent, or the tales which are dark but good, but because it might be considered a bit highbrow.  If you like artsy - go for it.

B000VHPXR2|3.0|I gave this three stars because no matter how bad the sound, the music is that good.  Still, it's hard to believe that this is a remaster.  For some reason they decided to mess with the fine mix from the LP and, instead, crank the vocal parts way up above the instruments.  Sample some of the cuts and listen for yourself--if the LP is drilled into your head (like it is mine), you'll notice the difference.  ON THE OTHER HAND, the sound mix on the DVD is pitch-perfect, which makes the screw-up with the CD all the more baffling.  Tip: buy the DVD and rip the tracks to mp3 using freeware like DVD-MP3 Ripper.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|JJ Abram's Cloverfield offers unfortunate audiences worldwide a grossly malformed interpretation of what dimly passes for the Playstation meets Hollywood blockbuster. What -- if every GAP model ever auditioned threw a party in a SoHo loft and suddenly found themselves thrust into a live action-anime Armageddon so laughably concocted that most of the z-listed trend-bots who grimace their way through this mess find career prolonging mercy in an early death.  Cloverfield is a contemporary filmmaking cluster-f__K overdosing on shaky-cams, extemporaneous, exponentially stupid dialogue and plot-holes so cavernous that Mothra herself would be swallowed whole.  And, c'mon Mr. Abrams, the cost-of-entry in this genre has to be a somewhat convincing monster. Would you have me believe that NYC is being eviscerated by a creature that apparently combines the physical characteristics of a Velociraptor capped by the head of the Munster's Al Lewis and a tropical fish in dire need of anger management... and while we're at it... some bare bones plausibility as well... would you also have me believe that our extremely pissed-off extraterrestrial can throw the head of Lady Liberty from New York Harbor to Spring Street on the fly and barely mark the pavement. After nearly ninety minutes the only horror in evidence is that this castrated eyesore was ever greenlighted.  If Cloverfield were strictly a goof, all would be forgiven - however - there's a sulfuric whiff of a message interred within the comatose script - Japanese comeuppance or some such nonsense. This film is an atrocity in every respect so do yourself a favor and head to the nearest exit.
B001AR0D4A|1.0|This is truly an awful movie.  The acting is horrible, the special effects are a joke, and it moves tediously slow.    I suspect it's supposed to move you in some way in it's portrayal of various stereotypes, but it's really nothing more than a B movie.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|For over five years, I've been waiting for a new Metallica album to wash out the \\"St. Anger\\" taste.  \\"Death Magnetic\\" is better than \\"St. Anger,\\" and it's a good album for any other metal band, but for Metallica, for five years in the making, it's disappointing.    1. That Was Just Your Life, 10/10:  This is one of the fastest seven-minute songs I've ever heard, and easily the best song on the album and the best choice for an opener.  It has a lot of cool hooks, breakdowns, etc.  In making this album, I suspect that the band put more effort into this song than any of the others; that's what it sounds like.  2. The End of the Line, 5/10:  It starts off kind of okay, but then it goes into some bad territory.  The whole song has a very sloppy feel to it.  3. Broken, Beat & Scarred, 5/10:  This song has the same problem as a \\"St. Anger\\" song: It's a four-minute song stretched to six and a half, very repetitive.  4. The Day That Never Comes, 8/10:  There is a lot to like about this song: the opening, the shifts toward the end, the use of a lot of different familiar (circa 1988) elements.  It gets marked down for the lyrics though, which as many have mentioned, are kindergartner level.  5. All Nightmare Long, 3/10:  \\"Nightmare\\" and \\"Long\\": the title tells you what to expect.  This song is at about the level of the worst of \\"St. Anger.\\"  Again, it's a filler song stretched out way too far.  6. Cyanide, 7/10:  This one has a lot of potential to grow on you on repeated listens, but it doesn't immediately grab you as a standout track.  7. The Unforgiven III, 8/10:  You could make an argument that \\"The Unforgiven II\\" was as good as the original, but you can't say that for this sequel.  Still, it's not bad, and it has its moments, especially the bridge, which is about the same melody used for the original, but completely different instrumentally.  It's like the kind of thing you would expect a tribute band to do.  8. The Judas Kiss, 8/10:  There are a lot of very catchy piecesto this song.  It's one of those songs that shouldn't be good, but after you hear it, you think, \\"That was enjoyable.\\"  9. Suicide & Redemption, 4/10:  As instrumentals go, this is probably Metallica's worst ever.  It's not creative or shifty enough to stand on its own.  Still, considering some of the lyrics on this album, an instrumental wasn't such a bad idea.  10. My Apocalypse, 7/10:  It's a fast song; you have to give it that, and it's the only one with a good length for radio without editing.  It's still a little too reminiscent of \\"St. Anger\\" in its straight aggressiveness without shifts or builds.    In general, they're just not putting the same effort into their songs that they used to.  It's not just that there are no radio friendly songs, which isn't necessarily a problem, it's that what made Metallica great, the creative and intricate riffs and breakdowns, the decent (for a metal band) lyrics, the epic feel to big songs--it's all lacking.  If this was the attempt to return to \\"Master of Puppets\\" glory, as it was advertised months earlier, it's just not going to happen ever again.  As many reviewers have mentioned, the sound quality is also a problem.  They just made it too loud.  I checked on my Sony Sound Forge, and sure enough, solid blocks of blue, meaning serious sound clipping.  Despite these problems, it's an okay album with some good songs on it.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|OK, we all know that you are a RUSH fan, or you're not, so preaching to the choir here.  After 60 shows (27 S&A), I am just a wee bit biased ;-)  The joy comes from watching the band take their songs, which were perfection on vinyl, and uses their experience and maturity to turn them into literal masterpieces live in concert.  RUSH's consistency is unreal, as I can attest by attending so many shows in just one tour.  They play like machines, every time, without fail.  Watching ALEX and his antics from up close really is the icing on the cake (IMO).  To a die-hard through and through RUSH fan, the release of this DVD is literally an anticipated moment that espouses indescribable emotions upon viewing!  Alex, Neil, Geddy...happy 56th birthdays, and please stay healthy and write the soundtracks to our children's lives (as in my neice and nephew's signs for Alex in Philly '08) so the \\"new RUSH generation\\" (the other Philly sign) can make sense of this world in the way only enlightened RUSH fans can!!!

B001641ZFS|3.0|The two five-star reviews here seem familiar with the career of Giuliano Carmignola, but all I know is that he serves as concertmaster for Abbado's new Italian ensemble, the Orchestra Mozart of Bologna. Presumably these are live concert recordings of th five Mozart violin concertos, plus the sublime Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola (with added soloist Danusha Waskiewicz). This 2-CD set at a bargain price is the companion to a similar twofer of Mozart symphonies from Abbado. But here the style is more period-flavored. I think anyone listening blind, in fact, would assume that the conductor was Gardiner, Norrington, or any number of HIP specialists.<br /><br />I'm no fan of that style, but these readings are lively and infectious. None of the Mozart violin concertos rises to the tank of his masterpieces for piano, so giving them a brisk, elegant run doesn't strip away the patina of genius. Carmignola also plays like a period soloist; his tone is a bit zingy to my taste, but his intonaiton is dead on pitch. Everything goes along bright and sparkling, which gets tiresome, but that no doubt is a minority opinion. The Sinfonia Concertante is almost off-handed as it zips along, and here I feel a serious loss, becasue this music deserves more.  The first movement is nerve-racking in its impatience, and the Finale, conducted one to a bar, disappears before you know it.<br /><br />In all, I'll give three stars in full recognition that enthusiasts for HIP performances will think that's far too stingy.
0800141660|5.0|Another Jane Austen great! Emma Thompson was wonderful as Elinor. She embodied the ideal of \\"sensibility\\" in love. She deserved the Golden Globe award for \\"best screenplay\\".

I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, romantic film.
B00004S367|5.0|At the beginning of the 1970s, Stevie Wonder, along with Marvin Gaye, aimed to and succeeded in gaining control of his musical output from the bosses at Motown, with the aim of moving from singles to album-length statements with much longer and more complex songs.<br /><br />Wonder's first work in this direction, [[ASIN:B000001AET Where I'm Coming From]] was disappointing and lacked memorable material. With \\"Music of My Mind\\", however, Wonder took even more control of what he was performing and became the first artist to play all or almost all of the instruments on a record. Only a trombone on the opening track by Art Baron and a guitar on the second by Buzzy Feiton was not his own work.<br /><br />If anybody had doubts Wonder wanted to do much more than he was allowed during the 1960s, the stunning opener \\"Love Having You Around\\" puts paid to them. The dense, funky electronic rhythms not only manage to maintain a rock-solid emotional level over the full seven minutes, but do not even sound dated when one listens to modern electronica. \\"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\\" is the most famous song here: a two-part eight-minute piece that has often been seen as misogynist because the opening verses deplore women's career advancement. Having heard \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" on the radio, one can hardly criticise Wonder's lyrics, and the complex music and arrangements express a dark despair in the second part, but do so in a gorgeous manner that rubs off more deeply than any later ballad Wonder would ever write.<br /><br />After the two opening tracks, it is no surprise Wonder's ambition drops a bit. Yet, \\"I Love Every Little Thing About You\\", \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" and \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\" possess a simple beauty that time cannot diminish. The austere, quaint \\"Girl Blue\\" has a drum sound comparable to Jaki Liebzeit at the same time over a voice that manages to be beautiful even if heavily processed. \\"Seems So Long\\" is even more spartan, yet Wonder's voice soars in a way he would never equal.<br /><br />Penultimate track \\"Keep On Running\\", though, returns to and equal the epic intensity of \\"Love Having You Around\\". Though the rhythms are more conventional, the repetitive line \\"keep on running/running from my love\\" is one of the most hypnotic vocals in any form of popular music and the rhythm at the opening is pure trance.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Music of My Mind\\" stands as the finest work of early 1970s soul. Whereas most artists in the genre focused on expanding the sound of the genre via orchestration that often sounds soppy today, \\"Music of My Mind\\" relies on spartan electronic sounds to produce songs of heartfelt beauty and resonance.

B000002G7G|5.0|If White Light/White Heat is the late night downtown scene, not so much on a Friday or Saturday, but on a Wednesday, when only the locals and the hardcore seed the bars and clubs, then this one is the lower East Side on a very hot and bright Sunday afternoon, long ago, long before our modern era of boutiques and designer pastries, but rather when the lower East Side on a Sunday afternoon was mainly deserted among the tenements, the record stores and book stores shuttered up, the drunk sprawled out across the asphalt, and the romancer heading out of his shared studio walk-up in search, flies buzzing and all the parking spaces taken.
B000002UA0|2.0|I have never been a fan of Pink Floyd's later work (indeed I would rate \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" as one of my most hated songs), but as I expand my musical knowledge I have became naturally curious about \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", Pink Floyd's only full album with original frontman Syd Barrett and often accalined as one of the best albums of all time.<br /><br />People have always called this \\"the Pink Floyd album for people who hate Pink Floyd\\" with reference to comments by Sex Pistol John Lydon during the \\"punk revolution\\".<br /><br />\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is certainly different from later Floyd works. There are none of the big-sounding synthesisers that gained them superstar status beginning with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". Instead, even on the more epic pieces, the sound is stripped down with Rick Wright playing quite simple organ lines. On the whole, the instrumentation on \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is delicate and quiet in a manner that was no doubt unusual and innovative at a time when already there was a move towards harder, louder rock and roll.<br /><br />Generally I do appreciate this kind of touching softness, but far too often, most especially on the finale \\"Bike\\" and \\"Matilda Mother\\", \\"Piper\\" is far too slight to be possessed of emotional depth and Barrett's soundscapes com off as tuneless compared to, say, [[ASIN:B000005IRG Marquee Moon]]. Even less lightweight songs like \\"Pow R Toc H\\" do not really fire. However, \\"Lucifer Sam\\", the second track, stands out as a surprising exception to my reservations about this record and is the only real \\"masterpiece\\" any incarnation of Pink Floyd ever made. Aided by a fine bassline from Waters and short organ solos from Wright, the band on \\"Lucifer Sam\\" sounds much tighter than anywhere else and even if Barrett's lyrics are silly, they don't lessen the quality of the song.<br /><br />The worst problem with \\"Piper\\", though, is Barrett's voice, which simply is ill-suited to the material he penned and comes of at best as mediocre, at worst as completely limp and lacking in energy and depth. Often Syd seems not to know whether he should be sining or speaking, and comes off without the touching quality good psychedelic rock should have.<br /><br />All in all, except \\"Lucifer Sam\\", there is little justification for \\"Piper\\"'s lofty reputation.

I'm sure most people know the storyline by now you have a young teenage girl Juno who after having sex gets pregnant and now after a while of thinking it over decides to have the baby full term and than give the baby up to a surrogate couple.  For me I couldn't seem to care less what happened to Juno or the baby I know it sounds mean but the storyline they used has been done over many times and a lot more better than this trashy movie.  The soundtrack also was pretty pathetic except for one or two but all in all the songs they used by this one singer Kimya Dawson made me want to put this dvd in the garbage disposer.  To people who are looking for a heart-felt movie similar to this I say try checking out Natalie Portman's movie Where The Heart Is I guarantee you that would be a much better choice than this cornball dvd.
B000000Y87|5.0|Anyone interested in the evolution of the jazz piano trio should purchase this album for it captures the great Bill Evans at the peak of his powers along with the late legendary bassist Scott LaFaro. Recorded in September of 1961 at the Village Vanguard, the trio's interplay is indeed telepathic but unfortunately several days later, Scott LaFaro would be tragically killed in an auto accident. Before I forget, let's not forget the contributions of drummer Paul Motian to this trio. At a time when many drummers would state the beat, Motian would imply it in his own way as Elvin Jones would in the famous Coltrane quartet. But this trio set the mode for other future trios to come since the bass also now had a voice rather than customarily maintaining a pulse. LaFaro's influence would spread to other heavyweights bassists such as Richard Davis, Gary Peacock, Eddie Gomez, Dave Holland and Miroslav Vituous, several of which who also played in Miles Davis' bands. This album along with the trios of Bud Powell on Blue Note & Verve should be added to any essential jazz lists of important trios.

B00005NTJM|5.0|This is one of those albums that are the highest quality. I mean it's recorded perfectly and the members are really talented. The style is blues-folk-rock-and-a-little-of-something-else and it works pretty well, at least in Jethro Tull's case. Ian Anderson is great on his flute, the OTHERS are amazing too. Guitar riffs don't feel out-of-place in the blues and folk songs, which is somewhat rare.<br />  Never heard this album without the bonus tracks, but it seems to me that they had to be there all along! That means if you don't have the album, buy this reissued version. And with such a great cover art, how can you miss?

What a refreshing read it is, particularly after reading years' worth of Bridget Jones knock-offs.    Watermelon deals with unplanned pregnancy, unplanned single parenthood, and the plain old misery of being dumped, in a way that is raw and honest.  Marian Keyes is a master of humor-from-tragedy, and this book is one of her best.  I highly, highly recommend it.

0757302661|5.0|I was originally very skeptical of natural childbirth, but after doing a lot of research during pregnancy, and seeing the real statistics of less interventions = better outcomes for mom and baby, I became interested in Hypnobirthing.  I recommend also reading &#34;Childbirth Without Fear&#34; by Grantley Dick-Reade, upon which all forms of hypnosis for childbirth are based.  I did not take the HB class, only a general childbirth education class provided by my hospital which covered the biology/mechanics, as well as touching on various methods of managing labor, medication options, natural options, etc.  I highly recommend that any mom-to-be avail herself of such a class, no matter what approach/philosophy you choose, so that you will learn about the specific procedures and attitudes at YOUR hospital or birthing center.  No single book can prepare you properly.  I did listen to the CD exercises almost daily from about 6.5 months on.  I found Ms. Mongan's writing/speaking to be much more grounded, practical, and open for my own feelings and interpretations than other HB materials I tried.  Other hypnosis audios were very specific about exactly what imagery I should visualize, which often gave me a negative reaction.  Ms. Mongan works more by suggesting the desired feeling, such as peace, warmth, safety, &#34;surrounded by beautiful colors&#34; etc - so my own mind could supply the specific place/image.  My birth experience was not some ideal fantasy, but it was much, much better than it might have been, and far easier than average in my circumstances. Due to some unique circumstances, my midwife recommended induction, but thanks to HB I was able to avoid an epidural, which made my recovery much, much quicker.  In the end, the &#34;traditional&#34; labor and delivery doctors and nurses could not believe my labor went so quickly (about 7 hour from receiving the Pitocin) or was so calm, focused and quiet.  My midwife and birth-center nurse were very supportive and respected my need for quiet and focus in the room. I did request a shot of Demerol about 2.5 hours before the birth, and a shot of local Novocain during pushing.  However, my midwife recommended these as an alternative to the epidural. I completely credit Hypnobirthing with making me relaxed enough to let the birth progress so quickly and easily.  In the early stages of labor, before I had the Pitocin (up to about 4 cm), I had NO PAIN.  NO PAIN AT ALL.  I felt the contractions as warmth and pressure, as described in the Mongan book.  The nurse monitoring my contractons was incredulous when she asked &#34;how's your pain&#34; and I told her I had none.  She looked at the monitor, which I assume was spiking because I felt a &#34;surge&#34;.  &#34;You didn't FEEL that??????&#34; she gasped.  &#34;yes, but it didn't hurt.&#34;  The Pitocin did hurt - a lot. As it was, the pain was just something to deal with, breathe through and remain in the &#34;now&#34; (HB training).  One caveat prompted by reading some of the negative reviews from people who had difficult and disappointing birth experiences - if you are going to choose natural childbirth, you must choose a dr/midwife/healthcare provider that you trust and will listen to. I knew my midwife was 100% supportive of my wishes, is a firm and longtime believer in natural childbirth, and most importantly put my baby's best interest first.  So when she said, &#34;if it weren't for this issue, I'd let you progress naturally, but we are on a deadline and need to use Pitocin,&#34; I trusted her judgment.  If you are rigid in your mind, you cannot be relaxed in your body.  You  cannot control the experience of labor and birth - no one can.  If you cling to a script of how things are &#34;supposed&#34; to happen, you are just creating tension.  Having confidence in your ability to give birth naturally does NOT mean forcing yourself to believe that all &#34;good&#34; births must conform to a certain image.  It means being confident that you have made good choices, and that the goal is a healthy mom and healthy baby, not a trophy experience.  This book gave me that confidence and the techniques I needed to see it through. I'm currently shopping for a second copy now that I'm expecting my second child, because my original copy has been passed on to so many friends of friends I can't get it back.
0375826726|3.0|After reading Brisingr, I have come to the unfortunate conclusion that a synopsis about 3 pages long would have sufficed for this encredibly \\"wordy\\" book.  Very little actually occured until the last 150 pages, making it feel like Paolini wanted to create another book just to be paid more.  So unfortunately I will be waiting until the fourth book to get anwsers to my top ten questions.  He should have kept to his original idea and kept it to a trilogy.
0618164413|5.0|What a wonderful book!  It takes me right back to childhood, and my children love it.  It really holds their attention.  Highly recommended, and great value for money.  Excellent quality and fast shipping, goods arrived in perfect condition
B0013L2EDQ|5.0|James Rollins is amazing. I love his stories.  Clive Clusser starts off great but his endings are a bit predictable and repetitive.  Besides Dirk Pitt seems a bit too unrealistic with his super heroism and his bachelor ego.  Give me one of James Rollins' heroes any day.  Rollins is definitly number 1 in my charts on action and suspense novels.  Where is his movie? Sahara was an awesome movie, but if they made more than one Dirk Pitt movie fans would be upset about predictability of it or too blinded by bombs and guns,etc. to know any different.<br /><br />I loved following Marco's trail and his life as it entwined with our present.  A lot of the details in the book were things that I have some knowledge on so to be able to play around with ideas that were already there in my mind gave me increased depth into the story as it unfolded.<br /><br />The characters are great too and I am glad to see more of Seichan and to see her story come alive a little more.  If I am right, I would guess her story has not ended.  I was a little disappointed to see Vigor's niece cut out of Grey's life, but Seichan filled the void...a little.  I was really disappointed about Monk.  I still do not really know his fate...was it a mechanical error or did he survive? Such a strong character as Monk, you don't expect him to get killed off and I kept expecting his resurrection, but am still unsure.<br /><br />All around, great book.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|The grand news is: Judas Priest decided to push things further. I've been a huge fan of theirs for nearly thirty years now, and I knew that they had this in them. Casual listeners wanted more of \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\", but I now ask the same casual listeners to try to lose that mindset; open up, and discover how brilliant \\"Nostradamus\\" IS.<br /><br />Many people have been buying this album thinking retro. The fact is, Judas Priest already released a \\"Living After Midnight\\"/ \\"Breaking the Law\\"/\\"Don't Go\\" album, \\"Angel of Retribution\\".<br /><br />Much like the fantastic recent release of Manowar, \\"Gods of War\\", \\"Nostradamus\\" pushes the boundaries of how \\"metal\\" is usually defined. In plainer language, cds like \\"Nostradamus\\" and \\"Gods of War\\" are expanding the boundaries, which means that Metal will last longer as an ART FORM (the same art form that was definitively invented by the composer Richard Wagner in the late 19th century). No, we're not talking laugh-out-loud pretentious boredom like Opeth, Avantasia, Edguy, Lost Horizons, ad nauseum.<br /><br /> This is one of the best Rock/Metal bands ever, shattering convention and revolutionizing the genre and sub-genres they practically invented.<br /><br />Without a forerunning band like Judas Priest daring to do more with Metal, it (Metal) will continue to decline in aesthete. I realize this isn't particularly important for a casual-listening headbanger (I'm not implying you're one of course, if you are of course that's just fine). But as a lifelong lover of Metal, Judas Priest, and the last Great composer of music, Richard Wagner I most certainly DO care about music AS music with depth, scope, and range.<br /><br />People like Manowar and Priest have released albums that will insure the longevity of the heavy metal genre. Manowar's \\"Gods of War\\" was the single most important Metal release of 2007, and though \\"Nostradamus\\" had alot of competition in 2008, it definitely stands head to head with ANY release in 2009. I'm talking about in terms of power, guts..BUSTING through perimeters.<br /><br />Buy it, give it three intent listens, and you'll start hearing exactly what I mean. This release is most certainly NOT without errors (read the other reviewers here for more details on what's \\"wrong\\" with this cd. But the benefits resolutely outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />The second disc is overall harder-edged for a good reason. Priest has reached a far more developed sense of dynamics in their compositional skills.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this one.power, guts..BUSTING through perimeters.

B000BO0LKY|5.0|This is perhaps the most exquisite, perfect album Mariah Carey has ever made. From start to finish, it is pure pop/rnb decadence. From the banging club beats of the opener, \\"It's Like That\\" to the soaring, gospel crescendo of \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", this album is last rallying call of Mariah's 5-octave powerhouse voice. As her newest album has shown, that voice is all but gone now and little remains of its once glorious power and range. TEOM is it swan song - she lets loose with her famous (or infamous) high notes and full power belts and she sings most songs on the album in her chest voice. The breathiness does pop up now and then but instead of detracting from the songs, it add texture.     The album is a assortment of all different musical flavors - clubbangers like \\"It's Like That\\", contemporary rnb like \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", and \\"One and Only\\", classic soul like \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay the Night\\", and Circles\\", light-hearted disco/pop like \\"Your Girl\\", smooth, laid-back grooves like \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Say Somethin'\\", and gospel like \\"Fly Like A Bird\\".    The only miss is \\"To The Floor\\", a laid-back, club type song with Nelly. It's okay, but takes a while to grow on you.    All in all, this is an amazing album from Mariah. It's certainly her best this decade and possibly the most well-executed and listenable since Daydream.     Unfortunately, we may not get another musical gem like this from Mariah. Her voice has completely fallen apart and she's decided to follow of the path of all the wanna-be Beyoncés and make vapid, soulless music with no intergrity or meaning. Hopefully, she can rise past the current mess that is E=MC2 and come back with another classic Mariah album.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|Lennon's fifth (I'm not counting the dreck before Plastic Ono Band) studio album is an improvement over Mind Games. Walls & Bridges was recorded during his infamous \\"lost weekend\\" & it's amazing that he even got this album done. Walls & Bridges was his second album to be a #1 album. \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" was a #1 single & \\"#9 Dream\\" went, coincidentally, to #9 on the charts.    The album opens with \\"Going Down on Love\\" which explains his situation concisely at that time. A separation from Ono wasn't doing him a lot of good. \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" is one of the most pop inflected things he ever did. It's upbeat & makes you want to get on the dance floor. It has a great sax solo & great harmony vocals from Elton John. \\"Old Dirt Road\\" is a comfortable song co-written with Harry Nilsson who was John's drinking buddy during the \\"lost weekend\\". Lennon had also produced Nilsson's studio album at this time. \\"What You Got\\" finds Lennon getting funky with a guitar riff driven song that shows he could still rock. Like most of these songs on this album, Lennon exposes his inner feelings & expresses the loss he was feeling at the time. \\"Bless You\\" slows the tempo & has John going for that \\"dreamy\\" sound; there is a tasteful keyboard base to this song provided by Ken Ascher. Though some might feel, rightfully so, that much of this album was written with Ms. Pang in mind I can't help but hear this as Lennon baring his emotional sleeve concerning his separation from Yoko. \\"Scared\\" reveals these feelings better than almost any song Lennon ever did. Like many of the songs on this album Lennon eschews the use of a guitar as a lead instrument turning to a saxophone as the primary solo instrument. \\"#9 Dream\\" is a song that goes for that \\"dreamy\\" sound that has the music to convey that feeling (don't you just hate what has been done to this song?). \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)\\" is a time filler. \\"Steel & Glass\\" is, arguably, the best song onthe album. It's in a minor key, which I love, that allows John (or anyone) to express his innermost feelings, plaintively. \\"Steel & Glass\\" is a perfect description of Lennon, himself; a man of many contradictions, so strong &, yet, so weak. Jesse Ed Davis does some great wah-wah pedal leads in this song. \\"Beef Jerky\\" is a funky instrumental that has a guitar riff giving it impetus. \\"Nobody Love You (When You're Down and Out)\\" which is one of John's most insightful songs. His lyrics take us where we really don't want to go, they tell it like it is & they don't cut us too muck slack. They're not mean-spirited but they are incisive. And like John says, \\"Everybody loves you when you're six foot in the ground.\\" How often is that true in our lives? We can't speak well of some people until they're gone. But, then, everybody gets themselves an eulogy, don't they? The original album closes with the incredibly lame \\"Ya Ya\\" that John recorded with his son, Julian.    The disc has three bonus tracks added to the original. The first, \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" is a live version that John performed with Elton John with Elton's band. The next bonus cut is \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\". This version is a demo version that's remarkably similar to the studio version. What makes this version stand out is that it's the down to the bare bone which makes it even more powerful. There aren't any studio tricks or sweetening; it doesn't get any more down to the basics than this. The last bonus cut is a Lennon interview in which he exhorts the company line of \\"buy this album\\". The booklet comes with lyrics, musician credits & a brief history of the name Lennon.
0553565915|5.0|I recently lost a brother.  A friend loaned our mother this book.  The book didn't answer all my questions, but it did address a significant portion of them.  I found her story captivating and comforting, and I intend to buy my own copy so I can highlight the most meaningful portions.  The author describes heaven as a place so wonderful that she did not want to return to her body.  If you're wondering where your deceased loved ones are now, I recommend reading this book.
B000WC39SG|3.0|I hate to rate this movie as three stars being that it's one of the greatest war movies ever made, but I have a real issue with Fox. First off, they are the most expensive BD's of all the studios and secondly, they omit all of the special features enjoyed on previous DVD versions. Instead of maxing out a BD50 disc with the MPEG2 codec, it would be great to use what other studios employ, namely VC-1 and utilising the extra space for special features. Fox charge at least $10 more for their titles in part probably due to the extra security measures they insist on using. The movie itself is not best conversion to Blu-ray I have seen and can seem a little too soft focused for the most part, but the the actual film is first class with one of the largest star lists I have ever seen including Sean Connery, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins and just too many to mention. If only Fox could just get their act together and treat movies like this, The Battle Of Britain, Master & Commander, Kingdom Of Heaven and others with the respect they deserve.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I bought this set when it was the goldbox special. I was so happy to finally own the whole set before the movie came out. After reading the reviews of bad disc I decided to watch some tonight. I could not even get the first disc out! It was glued to the paper! After removing it I attempted to clean the glue with a disc cloth, it did not matter. The disc will not play and skips. I tried the next disc which was also defective on the back, glue and marked, and it would not play. I did not even make it passed the first page which is the two discs. This is a great looking set but quality is very poor. If you want to look at the box this is for you. If you want to watch the discs, buyers beware! Not even 12 mins. and it is still skipping all over terrible quality! I am returning these and will not be asking for an exchange due to the fact other buyers have the same problem. Sad, it was a great deal.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is probably my favorite studio album by KISS.  While not totally capturing the live show, this is maybe the closest, second maybe only to Dynasty or at least at that level, of their live stuff.  There are so many good songs here.  It is just a fun romp of an album.  Sit back and enjoy.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|A couple more hilarious moments that I don't notice other reviewers mentioning:<br /><br />-- Wentworth and Harville ignoring the drenching swells that are about the wash them off the Cobb.<br /><br />-- Charles Musgrove crossing the log bridge and strolling around the dining room leaving his shotgun unbroken and in firing position.  I was a little disappointed that he didn't take out any of the characters that I could have done without seeing for the following sixty minutes.
B000LXH0AE|1.0|I guess I saw a different movie than most of the other posters here.  The movie I saw seemed like a poorly constructed Twilight Zone episode, not at all a Charlie Kauffman type film.<br /><br />In my opinion, the film quickly falls apart under the shaky rules it establishes. The central problem--in addition to this seeming like a cliche from a Carol Burnett show--is that the writer herself lives in the same world as her creation.  This poses all sorts of questions.  For instance, if she's writing about his job/apartment, how did he come to gain employment and a job in an office in the real world?  Is the office where he works also her creation? Is the apartment building?  Since she also seems to control the romance between Ferrell and Maggie Gillengall(sp?), does that mean Gillengall is another character she dreamed up? If not, why does Gillengall do exactly what the author tells her to do when describing the romantic scene between Gillengall and Ferrell?<br /><br />Perhaps the film might have worked better if the author created the character and he then stepped into the real world (ala Woody Allen's \\"Purple Rose of Cairo\\"), but even so, the prose the writer puts out is laughably amateurish.  This novel would not see the light of day (99% tell, 1% show) and even if it did, Thompson would hardly be a respected author.<br /><br />Lame. Pretentious. Predictable.
0312330871|5.0|Then There Were None, also published as The Ten Little Indians, was one of the most page-turning thrillers I've read. This book will keep you up all night and day wanting to finish it. This book is about 10 unsuspecting people going to an unknown island for a vacation. Each person is persuaded over for various reasons. The longer they stay, the weirder things get. Each day someone is killed, but there is no other people on the island despite a butler. As the members are being killed off, it leaves everyone thinking. Who is the murderer?<br /><br />This book will be the best thriller/mystery book you may read. It's darkness and spookiness keeps you interested. The way the book's written makes you feel like you're in the book, trying to save yourself. But you never know which order you may go in. I highly reccomend this book, so enjoy.
0375826726|1.0|I would love to offer a review on the book, but since it won't be here till the 24th, I can't. This is the last time I will ever pre-order, or even buy a book from amazon.com. I am very tempted to go buy it today since all the eragon groups I belong to the members already have it and are half way through or finished. I couldn't be more disappointed in Amazons shipping on this one.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Darn good movie about a Jewish fugitive who's Family and friends are massacred in an ambush, while attempting to escape the Nazis to neutral territory. She ends up helping the Dutch Resistance getting \\"inside\\" the local Gestapo to spy, sabotage and derail their actions against the Resistance in 1944. Excellent story line and script continuity that keeps you interested, with no slowdown between scenes.<br /><br />The Jewish woman Rachel Stein becomes Ellis De Vries and temps fate at nearly every corner, all the while, falling in love with the German Captain Meuntze; who is trying to reach a truce with the Resistance (unbeknownst to his Superiors). Barely escaping with her life, \\"The Resistance\\" still after her at war's end; thinking she had double-crossed them, contributing (wrongly) to the deaths of dozens of Jews and Dutch Resistance. With the \\"real collaborator\\" uncovered in the Black Book she happens upon, from one of the many Nazi collaborators as he's killed soon after the Allied Liberation.<br /><br />Excellent acting from Carice Van Houten as Rachel Stein/Ellis De Vries, Thom Hoffman as Dr. Hans Aakermanns; one of the Resistance leaders (and turning out to be a Nazi Collaborator), Sebastian Koch as the German Captain Ludwig Muentze and superb Direction by Paul Verhoeven.<br /><br />Darn, I'm really beginning to love these European films. Another good Dutch film is \\"May 6th\\" - (2004) Based on events surrounding the 2002 assassination of Pim Fortuyn.
B000BYA5G4|1.0|... but have some compassion on the criminals profiting, after all, it's the fault of governments and military leaders. This sums up the \\"deep\\" message of this \\"based on some real events\\" hollywood [sic] dribble.    We put off watching this one not long enough.    Oh, it is believable and there is little doubt in my mind that some similar activities do take place, but the only naive reviews, in my opinion, are the ones that see this crap as entertainment or somehow feel more enlightened by any movie, much less one that never claims to be a documentary.

0307341550|5.0|This is an extremely well-written and forceful book, especially for a first novel. There's nothing remotely tentative about this story of Chicago reporter Camille Preaker's return to her little southeast Missouri hometown to do a story on the murder of two local young girls less than a year apart. It may be the work of a serial killer and the local head cop is out of his depth, so they've called in a homicide specialist from Kansas City. But the murder investigation is only part of the story. More mesmerizing, and a good deal creepier, is Camille's re-examination of her own family, which brings new meaning to the description \\"dysfunctional.\\" Camille's younger sister, Marian, died two decades ago at about the same age as the recently murdered girls, having been \\"cared for\\" by Adora, their vampiric mother. Then, a few years later, Adora had another daughter, Camille's half-sister, Amma, who, at thirteen, is extraordinarily pretty, precociously sexual, and who bosses the clique that runs the school with calculated cruelty. She's very much her mother's daughter. Stephen King, not noted for gushing endorsements of other people's work, comments on the jacket that the effect of the narration is cumulative, and that's exactly right. As you move farther and farther into this horror, you dread what you know is probably coming, but you're unable to look away, to stop reading. Flynn's style is both unadorned and exquisitely sharp. The former comes out in Camille's matter-of-fact description of her own pathology: She's a \\"cutter,\\" having spent most of her life incising words into her body with knives and razors, cultivating the scars until she dare not wear anything but long sleeves and pants legs. The latter is demonstrated by the fact that this book just leaps with sly, quotable lines: \\"It was a natural gift for Adora, making other women feel incidental.\\"<br /><br />A visiting cop \\"peeled the label of the empty beer bottle next to him and smoothed it out onto the table. Messy. A sure sign he'd never worked in a bar.\\"<br /><br />In describing the way her mother manipulates everyone, Camille relates how the death of her little sister was so useful in that regard. No matter what anyone said, \\"my mother would not be distracted from her grief. To this day it remains a hobby.\\"<br /><br />Or, \\"Reporters are like vampires. They can't come into your house without your invitation, but once they're there, you won't get them out till they've sucked you dry.\\"<br /><br />Or, \\"`So hard to get good help these days,' she muttered earnestly, unaware no one really says that who's not on TV.\\"<br /><br />Or, \\"Like all rural towns, Wind Gap has an obsession with machinery. Most homes own a car and a half for every occupant (the half being an antique collectible, or an old piece of crap on blocks, depending on the income bracket).\\"<br /><br />One of my favorites, in describing an acquaintance's rather bland husband: \\"He was good-looking if you looked at him long enough.\\"<br /><br />Flynn also has the knack of setting an entire mood by describing a single detail. For example, the little town of Wind Gap snaps into focus when Camille notes that she found the police chief \\"banging the dent out of a stop sign at the corner of Second and Ely, a few blocks from the police station.\\" Or, of a group of 13-year-old girls passing around a bottle of rum: \\"The rim of the bottle was ringed with pink lip gloss.\\"<br /><br />Damn, that's good stuff.<br /><br />This is one of those books you'll keep thinking about for months. Flynn is definitely going on my list of new authors to watch.A sure sign he'd never worked in a bar.\\"<br /><br />In describing the way her mother manipulates everyone, Camille relates how the death of her little sister was so useful in that regard.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Great show. The only drawback is that everybody is a foul-mouthed sex maniac. Someone will probably say, \\"Not Dexter! He's not interested in sex.\\" But that convention is blithely thrown away in season two. Dex suddenly loves sex as much as everybody else. What changed his mind? I dunno. The writing doesn't persuade me as to a reason.<br /><br />I'm totally hooked on this show, though. The characters are multi-faceted and fascinating to watch. Everyone seems perfectly cast on this show. One minute you'll be cringing in horror, and the next you'll be laughing. This is how the best stories are written. The camera work is beautiful, and the writers are doing a good job with the peaks and valleys.<br /><br />I do get tired of the f-word and the gratuitous nudity, though. Most of the time, what you don't see on screen is way more powerful. Like when Dex slices someone up, the camera usually pans away and you only see the effect (oozing or splattering). That's good direction. But showing a gal's bare chest on a regular basis...not good direction. It's juvenile and unnecessary. Why are so many actresses so willing to take off their clothes for the camera? It's sad. If you make it to Season Two, you'll see a whole lot more of that, too. Lots of borderline pornographic sex with graphic descriptions, conversations and depictions. Not for everyone by any means. It's really kind of silly when you look at it. Suddenly, this brilliantly acted and directed show will drop down to the lowest common denominator and become ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT! I really don't need to hear someone describing to someone else how to have his way with her in graphic detail. The story just comes to a complete stop at that point.<br /><br />If you have a strong stomach and like a good story (for the most part), I can't recommend Dexter too much. Aside from the few exceptions I mentioned, it's great writing.

I bought it and read the entire thing in one sitting.  Jordan, if you're reading this review, the last few chapters brought me to tears.  I am familiar with AA, drug addiction/Alcohol addiction and your 'voice\\" was both hilarious and endearing.  I congratulate you.  I am looking forward to your (hopefully) long writing career!
B001DDBCUU|1.0|I just can't get over how people actually liked this movie? I am a huge fan of the series, I own the entire series, and thought that the finale of the series was fantastic! So why did they feel that they had to make a movie? First of all, they crammed way too much into the movie. It was like they were trying to do a whole season in the span of one movie. I don't want to give too much away, and if you haven't seen it don't read any further...<br />The whole wedding bothered me so much! Carrie deserved the big fancy wedding! Also, do you really think that Steve would have ever cheated on Miranda? Give me a break! The whole Mexico/Honeymoon was a complete waste of time, and come on, Carrie's \\"depression\\" was way overdone. I wish this movie was never made, I want to remember the fantastic series, not this mess of a movie!
B00192KCQ0|1.0|It saddens me to see what would've been Metallica's \\"comeback\\" to metal, however cliched and ironic the statement is, is such a dissapointment.<br /><br />I first heard news of the album a couple of years ago. Reading about Rick Rubin (who was slated to produce) and knowing how he'd produced some of the best metal albums of all time (Slayer, Danzig, etc), I thought this would be a match made in..well I guess its metal so we'll say \\"hell\\", lol.<br /><br />I also heard the early news about the album regarding 1the changeover back to standard tuning for the guitars, the return of solos, the return of complex songwriting (though make no mistake Saint Anger was no normal \\"nu metal album\\"), etc.<br /><br />I wasn't as excited as morbidly curious.<br /><br />I also knew that with Rob Trujillo in the fold, they would have another member lighting a fire under their respective buttocks.<br /><br />However, I first sensed something was amiss when I heard their cover of the Iron Maiden classic \\"Remember Tommorow\\" for a tribute album. The muddy sound coming from the speakers and the annoying (though in a different way than Saint Anger) overly loud snare of Lars Ulrich made me turned off of their rendition almost immediately.<br /><br />Flash forward a few months later and I hear an early leak of the release.<br /><br />Basically what amounts to a din of hard to distinguish noise comes out on top of some really killer (if somewhat rehashed) Metallica music.<br /><br />I knew something had happened to this album and I started writing on various sites for people to do a petition on remixing and remastering it.<br />I discovered that someone else had beaten me to the punch, and I subsequently joined their effort.<br /> What had happened is whoever mixed and mastered the thing boosted the levels too loud, and compressed all dynamics (dynamics being something that you study in music 1010, and also something that has never NOT been a part of Metal, I defy you listen to Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny if you do not believe me) and also there is what is known as \\"digital clipping\\" all over the album. The \\"digital clipping\\" part being the \\"fuzzy\\" sound that seems to go on the drums in some parts, or just \\"fragments\\" of sound that one can hear if they closely listen.<br />(If one wants to know what this amounts to, please read online about the \\"Loudness Wars\\" and Rush's Vapor Trails).<br /><br />A closer listen to the released version and one immediately notices that the bass parts are buried beneath the overly loud drums and strangely thin sounding guitars.<br /><br />What are the motivations for such a blunder? Its hard to say. The mastering engineer denies he had a part in it, the mixing engineer has been inconspicously absent in the debate, and both Rubin and Metallica themselves have declined to comment.<br /><br />Is it what amounts to releasing what is basically a butchered album. I can make a quick analogy for those who don't understand. Think about if Stephen King wrote a \\"comeback\\" book to compete with his early work. The hype was it was an \\"epic\\" book that would be his best work since \\"The Stand\\" and all sorts of critics read it and enjoyed it. Come release day, the book is published in a strange almost unreadable font, smeared across pages that fall out of the book from time to time. You have to hold it together and strain your eyes to really read it. This is what whoever decided to use this mixing process with Metallica did with their product, essentially.<br /><br />The strange irony is that the album was simultaneously released the same day as downloadable content for Guitar Hero III..The files did NOT have these issues, in fact there have been fans making their own \\"bootleg\\" mixes of the album themselves!<br /><br />These bootleg mixes have both the dry punch of Justice in the rhythm department, but also the more balanced mix of the Black Album.<br /><br />Now on to the music itself, as heard on these versions:<br /><br />The music is a quite dynamic (ironic eh?) mix of elements from the first four albums, with a modern meets Black Album touch.<br /><br />The first song is a modernized thrasher in the vein of \\"Blackened\\" from And Justice For All. It is quite infectious but also has some killer solos and progressions.<br /><br />The second song is a groove metal song meets thrash with a touch of progressiveness. It is clearly the best one-two punch since And Justice For All. The third song has a convulted, almost tech metal sounding rhythm attack, and while the \\"What doesn't kill ya makes ya more strong\\" was a little annoying at first, it quickly got stuck in my head. The fourth song follows in the tradition of other \\"fourth songs\\" off their albums from Ride-Justice. It is an epic ballad in the vein of One or Fade to Black, complete with second fast section and dual harmonies towards the end. \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is a bit overrated in my eyes, something that recalls some of the thrashier numbers on the Black Album.<br /><br />\\"Cyanide\\" is a bit underrated by fans, a midpaced number clearly influenced by mid-nineties Danzig but with a Metallica twist (though they say its influenced by the Cult, but the descending progression definitely recalls something as played by John Christ).<br /><br />The Unforgiven III is the only (real) filler here, a ballad that doesn't do anything that \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" didn't better, and features a chorus that sounds not dissimilar to Stone Temple Pilots \\"Creep\\".<br /><br />The next song is a fan favorite and the real \\"jewel\\" of the album, The Judas Kiss.<br /><br />It features a heavy dissonant riff with some real thrash midpaced riffing, sounding almost in between MOP and Justice at times. The solos are also good on this one.<br /><br />\\"Suicide and Redemption\\" is a great ballad in the vein of \\"And Live is to Die\\" and \\"Orion\\", a bit more laid back but melodious and cathcy to say the least.<br /><br />A strong start also requires a strong finish, and \\"My Apocalypse\\" is almost \\"Damage Inc\\" meets \\"The Struggle Within\\", complete with some decent double bass from Lars (for a change).<br /><br />Overall, the online remixed version sounds better, clearer, and you can hear the bass a lot more. There are parts that cannot be discerned on the retail version either, like a vocal effect on \\"All Nightmare Long\\", extra guitar parts, orchestral parts during \\"Unforgiven III\\" that made me not actually hate the song, and even the riffs can be heard clearer.<br /><br />If I have to give the retail version a rating, it would be one star or less because of the pathetic mixing of the album. The other \\"superior\\" version though, I would give four and a half or five stars, becuase it is a job well done.<br /><br />The question is, why did they let this bad mix come out? A lot of theories have popped up, and I will not speculate, but either way, the powers that be who let this slide have a lot to answer for.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|DIRTY HARRY has stood the test of time and remains a classic film based on the mores of a modern society tempered with logical judgment of how to dispense justice to those unlawful individuals in that society. Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry is the personification of that tool of logical judgment much to the disdain of his superiors and to the legal system he works within. DIRTY HARRY and SUDDEN IMPACT are the two films that bring the motivations and morality of this character under close scrutiny as he comes full circle with a rather dichotomous approach to his job over the span of time of these two films. When I first saw SUDDEN IMPACT I thought Clint Eastwood had somehow sold out on the underlying essence of the character he had been portraying. He took the realistic base from the first three DIRTY HARRY films (DIRTY HARRY, MAGNUM FORCE and THE ENFORCER) and replaced it with some type of pseudo surrealistic parody that seemed so repulsive it bordered on bad taste to say the very least. However, after repeated viewing it started to grow on me and I actually wanted to watch it over and over. I couldn't get enough of it. It certainly was not the same Dirty Harry but it had a very blunt approach for dealing with crime and criminals. In the first three films the bureaucrats constantly accused Harry of crossing the line yet the audience knew Harry was right and the bureaucrats were just a bunch of crybaby liberals (at least that's what the directors wanted us to think). In SUDDEN IMPACT Clint Eastwood is at the helm. Eastwood proposes a question to the audience: You like crazy? Do you want to see crazy? I'm going to give you crazy. Film making is a business and like a good businessman Eastwood gives his audience what they want. Yet Eastwood is no fool. Without artistic merit this film would have been a failure. Eastwood is playing the auteur filmmaker here and he is very successful at it. This film is way ahead of its time. The fabric of a sane society is being pulled apart. Family values, if you like, are out the window. Eastwood collects the most vile, repugnant and repulsive villains for this film that literally defines the meaning of trailer trash. The Mafia hoodlums at the beginning of the film look like... choirboys compared to the bunch of wacko amusement park crazies he ends up exterminating by the film's end. If Eastwood had not directed this film with his offbeat humor and unconventional style, if he had played it as a straight drama, the critics would have screamed murder. SUDDEN IMPACT is a good film. It's a stand-alone modern day apocalyptic tale delivered for your approval by Dirty Harry. Looking at MAGNUM FORCE there is an attempt to justify the true motivations of the character but that film is not successful thematically and is rather heavy handed. THE ENFORCER's straight forward approach is more satisfying. THE DEAD POOL is a rather lethargic almost sentimental look back at Harry and perhaps he has been assimilated by the very society he operated in and the system that no longer really seems like a system. Yet Harry has some of that starch still left in him. I can still remember Reni Santoni asking in the original DIRTY HARRY, \\"Why do they call you Dirty Harry?\\" Now we really know.art.

B00000G6H1|5.0|'Physical' is just one of those right time/right place sort of albums. It didn't break the mould as far as Olivia Newton-John albums went but it did what she'd be doing for years even better.<br /><br />Well, let's talk about the lead single, the title track. I doubt that even today there won't be many people who don't know it. At the time it was over-played to the point of insanity and was probably the beginning of the end for Olivia. 'Physical' was one of those singles that everybody bought but no-one liked much! Even amongst Olivia's diehard fanbase it's rarely up there in the best song polls unlike, say, 'Magic' or 'A Little More Love'.<br /><br />The second single, 'Make A Move On Me' hit #5, another sizable hit but it's the 3rd single, 'Landslide', that's THE song on the album for me. It was the opening track on side 1 of the LP and was as remarkable and astounding as 'Please Don't Keep Me Waiting' had been on the 'Totally Hot' album 3 years previouly. 'Landslide' was perhaps too complex for single release, indeed it only made #52, but it's one of her best vocal performances, and I say that knowing that the song is perhaps too much for her, and was the last truly great song John Farrar was ever to write for her.<br /><br />'Stranger's Touch' was first rate again. It was wasted as a B-side but would've probably made a better 3rd single than 'Landslide'. Another Farrar song 'Recovery' is a true classic. Decidedly strange, just check out the video, the multi-tracked harmonies are heavenly.<br /><br />Barry Gibb's 'Carried Away' is perfect Olivia balladry. Allegedly dropped from the Streisand 'Guilty' sessions, Bab's loss is definitely Olivia's gain.<br /><br />Farrar's 'Falling' is another fan fave but I've never been that fussed about it. It uses the top end of O's quavery, whispery voice too much and (as I found out to my cost) reduces non-Olivia fans to hysterics!<br /><br />Olivia's only self-penned tune, 'The Promise (The Dolphin Song)' was a sign of things to come. Simpering vocals paired with a syrupy melody and topped of with cringy lyrics that make you want to heave. Olivia was always much better when she didn't 'care!'<br /><br />The rest of the album could be classed as filler, although it's high quality filler. Olivia's vocals are excellent throughout. There's little of the silly squawks and hideous shrieks that occasionally adorn 'Totally Hot' and pretty much run all the way through 1985's disastrous 'Soul Kiss'. The production and songs are perfection too. Olivia was never more at the top of her game than here and never more current.<br /><br />If you're going to buy one ONJ album, get 'Totally Hot' and if you like that get this. Put aside tragic memories of 'The Rumour', 'Soul Kiss', 'Warm And Tender' and 'Gaia'and listen to Olivia when she really cared and put her back into her work.elody and topped of with cringy lyrics that make you want to heave.

B000002UA0|5.0|I always liked Syd's songs.  The Pink Floyd After Syd, turned into a very progressive rock band, which were   great at what they did, but there was one Roger (such a nice name-why didn't he keep it for the whole Floyd trip?) less than I came to expect.  I've read two books, when the now late Rick spoke of Syd, I believe he did so with a soft spoken yet sensible head.    A mental breakdown burned away \\"Syd's\\" chance for any semblance for a normal life afterward, and according to the \\"experts\\" there was a personality break. So this many years later, what's the story??????- there almost appears to be a family that is Syd's that didn't say much, but have you ever been in your own head, so messed up on garbage you can't think properly---so who really has--only as many as will be admitted to Psych wards.  Many, Many many highly creative, no I'll rephrase for clarity's sake Many highly creative highly intelligent people are not necessarily completely perfect- oh well he (Syd) was locked in a closet, and we could hear the clanging and banging, would you, as a friend, and bandmate check him.  I feel he was let down by his band mates, and his entourage-nothing more pathetic than the life of hangers on, wanna be's, and overall envious types.  Who's to say a few of those didn't exist and destroy Syd.  Rumour has it Mozart had the dreadful experience of dying with this.    How many less eloquent, however more belligerent rock and rollers that have brains wired to better them due to a less intense personality........ well let's pull one out of a hat..... resist putting hallucinagens, etc into their system, however, seem to fair very differently.      I just don't hear these questions : has this been confirmed as true about Syd, that he had a mental disorder, prior to a drug problem , hmm, why did nobody keep this in mind when he was their top songwriter--oh, well a mental sensitivity that allows one to be so creative and talented would be a person who thinks, a lot if we threw some high intelligence into that package. So, if  \\"Syd\\", as  \\"Roky\\" or the once beautiful \\"Sky\\" S. of the Seeds was noted to be frail,  I will never understand why.     Well, someday the truth will come out, as the existence Syd carried out is mixed with everything -lucky he could do what he did

B0018CMJSU|5.0|The new transfers for The Godfather Parts I and II are stunning. It really is like seeing them for the first time. All of the murky, faded colors have been restored to their original glory while still retaining the warmth of the film stock. Gordon Willis' then-controversial cinematography can finally be seen they way it was intended on these new discs. If you have the original box set, it is worth it to double dip if only for the restoration job on these two films.<br /><br />Carried over from the original set are all of Francis Ford Coppola's commentary tracks for the three films. On The Godfather one, he appropriately enough, starts off by talking about the film's famous opening scene and how it was supposed to start with the wedding but a friend suggested he do something else. Coppola talks about how he organized the elaborate wedding sequence and shot it only 2-3 days! He talks about the pressure he was under by the studio and in read danger of being fired because they didn't like what he was doing. This is pretty solid track that we've come to expect from the veteran filmmaker.<br /><br />Coppola's contributes another excellent commentary for The Godfather Part II. Initially, he had no interest in doing a sequel and dealing with studio bureaucracy. He suggested Martin Scorsese for the job. The studio balked at this idea and accepted all of Coppola's terms. The veteran filmmaker talks at length about the development of the Corleone family from Part I. Coppola is engaging and very articulate, delivering a top notch track that is well worth a listen for any fan of this movie.<br /><br />Finally, there is Coppola's commentary for The Godfather Part III. One of the heated debates the filmmaker had with the studio was over Pacino's hair. He wanted Michael to look older and like a man in crisis, while the studio didn't want to mess with Pacino's distinctive looks. Coppola defends his casting of Sofia and feels that she delivered a \\"real\\" performance because she wasn't an actor. He also addresses the scathing criticism she received as in fact an attack on him. This is a solid track with good observations and analysis by Coppola -- better than the film itself.<br /><br />The rest of the supplemental material is spread out of two discs. Thankfully for those who did not buy the first box set all of the extras from it have been carried over with a whole other disc of brand new material.<br /><br />The fourth disc features all the brand new material and starts off with \\"Godfather World,\\" which takes a look at how The Godfather films influenced popular culture, including parodies on The Simpsons and South Park, and how it informed the characters on The Sopranos. All kinds of celebrities, from William Friedkin and Alec Baldwin to author Sarah Vowell who sing its praises with clips of shows and films that reference it.<br /><br />\\"The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't\\" tells the story of how Hollywood had changed at the end of the 1960s with the demise of the studio moguls and the rise of the film brats, the first generation of film students who became filmmakers. One of them, Coppola, ended up being picked to direct The Godfather. This is an excellent look at how the director almost didn't get the gig and why.<br /><br />\\"...When the Shooting Stopped\\" examines the post-production phase of the first film. Coppola battled with the studio over the length of it. Executives initially did not like Nino Rota's score for the film and samples of some of his original and revised cues are played.<br /><br />\\"Emulsional Rescue: Revealing The Godfather\\" takes a look at the newly restored transfers for Part I and II and how they preserve Gordon Willis' gorgeous cinematography. This featurette takes us through the restoration process, showing before and after examples.<br /><br />\\"The Godfather on the Red Carpet\\" is a forgettable featurette shot during the premiere of Cloverfield with various minor celebrities gush about the films.<br /><br />\\"Four ShortFilms on The Godfather\\" features celebs citing which one they prefer, Part I or II. Another one has Richard Belzer, and the man who adapted the films for the stage, quote their favourite lines, which turns out to be quite funny. The third one sees Coppola talk about his love of cannoli and how made it into the film. Finally, Coppola answers the question about what happened to Clemenza in Part II and why he died.<br /><br />The fifth disc starts off with \\"A Look Inside,\\" a feature-length documentary about The Godfather trilogy done when Part III was being made. As a result, a lot of the major players were interviewed. We see Coppola at work on this film with on-set footage of the director working with Pacino. We also see Coppola working on the script with author Mario Puzo. The doc then goes back to the first film with Coppola's battle with the studio over casting Brando, Pacino, et al. with fascinating vintage screen tests and rehearsal footage. This is an excellent extra that goes into great detail.<br /><br />\\"On Location\\" revisits key locations in the lower east side of New York where they shot parts of all three films and how they transformed them into various historical periods.<br /><br />\\"Francis Coppola's Notebook\\" examines how he adapted Puzo's book into the first film. Coppola shows us his notebook that he used as his master document that he would constantly refer to. This featurette provides fascinating insight into the man's creative process.<br /><br />\\"Music of The Godfather\\" features an audio excerpt of a conversation Coppola had with composer Nino Rota about the music for the film. Also included is footage of composer Carmine Coppola (Francis' father) working on Part III. Francis talks about working with his father.<br /><br />\\"Coppola and Puzo on Screenwriting\\" features the author talking about the origins of his novel while Coppola discusses adapting it with Puzo into the films.<br /><br />\\"Gordon Willis on Cinematography\\" features the man talking his approach to the look of the film and the choices he made and why.<br /><br />\\"Storyboards - Godfather Part II and Part III\\" allows you to see sketches for the look of both films and see how Coppola planned to shoot them.<br /><br />\\"The Godfather: Behind the Scenes 1971\\" is a vintage promotional featurette done at the time of the production of the first film.

0060935464|5.0|This is a book which should change your life. Of course it is an outstanding American story; more, it is a study of American character--exceptional and inhuman. You will, if you read carefully, be forced to reckon you are more like a Finch or more like a Ewell. And, after that reckoning, you will different forever.    I'm sorry I read this so late in my life. (I would have accomplished more by following the example of Atticus.) But for the remainder of my days, I pledge allegiance to Atticus Finch. His example is that important, that just, that right.    Require yourself to read it; require those you can influence to read it. About the time this book was published, an important black man said: If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. I don't believe this is overstatement in these troubled times in America. If you don't read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" you are part of the problem. And, if you don't end up being--or striving to be--more like Atticus Finch, you are part of the problem.

B000063DI9|5.0|We all know the 'Golden' era of Maiden music. [1982-1988]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000063CP6 The Number of the Beast]]<br />[[ASIN:B000063DFQ Piece of Mind]]<br />[[ASIN:B000063DFN Powerslave]]<br />[[ASIN:B000063DHL Somewhere in Time]]<br />[[ASIN:B000063DI9 Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]<br /><br />Honestly, it's hard for me to a pick a favorite, but if you put a gun to my head, I'd say --- Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.<br /><br />Its a concept album and the story is easy to follow. A prophet tries to warn a village of an imminent attack.  Unlike other concept albums, you don't have to follow the story to enjoy the music.<br /><br />Dickinson has perfected his vocal skills,  which is evident on such tracks as 'Infinite Dreams' and 'The Prophecy'.  In fact, the vocals on SSOASS ranks as one of the best I've ever heard in the metal genre.  Every track is strong, with virtually no filler.  As always, the  guitar, bass, and drums are first rate.  Nicko Mcbrain's drumming skills are severely underrated.  Its not as fast or heavy as other Maiden discs, but in no way feels weak.  The synthesizers are very apparent,  but doesn't overwhelm the album like 'Somewhere In Time'.<br /><br />I would rate 'Infinite Dreams' and 'The Evil That Men Do' as my favorites.  Even though 'Can I Play With Madness' is a good tune, it really feels out-of-place. [Its a pop song on a progressive metal album.]<br /><br />Instead of wasting my time rating every song, realize I can play this disc everyday and never get bored.  Its easily one of my favorite albums of any genre.  Highly recommended.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|2008 has so far been a pretty good year for good old fashioned heavy metal.  Iced Earth and Metallica have both had great comebacks right when I feared that both bands might be over, and if that weren't enough, you can add to that what is possibly the best of them all with this awesome new release from Testament.  Their first album of original material in nearly ten years, \\"The Formation of Damnation\\" sees them picking up right where \\"The Gathering\\" left off.  This is just pure, no-nonsene heavy metal.  It doesn't try to do anything but just straight out rock hard, and rock hard it does.  Add to that the return of Greg Christian and Alex Skolnick, and the addition of drum chief Paul Bostaph, and you've got a damn near perfect metal album.<br /><br />This album is full of crushing riffs, spine-tingling solos, wicked time changes, thunderous drumwork, and of course Chuck Billy's oh-so-metal vocals, proving that his recent health problems fortunately haven't claimed his mighty voice.  Cool lyrics too, with a lot of interesting spiritual themes.  The lyrical topics are plenty \\"metal\\" without ever being lame or cheesy.  I like that, personally.<br /><br />Yeah, there's really not too much to analyze here.  This is just expertly crafted metal done as few can.  Fun and heavy but still sophisticated, very modern but still plenty of classic metal influence.  What more can you ask for?
159562015X|5.0|This is the 14th time I bought this book.  I've been buying it for friends and colleagues to take the test.  It is an EXCELLENT way to understand those around you better and how to approach them.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I know many of the maggots out there, were just like myself anxiously awaiting the new feed that is AHiG, so in turn, my review is as honest as a genuine fan can deliver.     I decide I wont just skip to Psychosocial and play it relentlessly but instead hear every tune like I have over the years. to my surprise this album is clear, collective, and melodic. With the exception of the Butcher's Hook , I find myself enjoying this album heavily. Onto the reviews;    1: .Execute.; It's an intro, what more can you ask for?, and in true Knot fashion. 4/5    2: Gematria (the Killing Name); This song introduces you to a minute of drum solo which entraps you into a lovely orchestra of guitars slowly lifting the drums, not ever passing the dominion of the drum entirely. Don't let the two guitar solo's fool you, this is a drum song and rightfully so. The speed up's and slow down's make this song one of my favorites to listen to. 4/5    3: Sulfur; A lovely tune that manges to pull you in with vocals you have been dying to hear. Corey's voice is as strong as ever, and this song demands you hear his every word. halfway through the song a guitar solo keeps you nodding your head and wanting more. 4/5    4: Psychosocial; The single everyone's been talking about. It obviously delivers. Corey's vocals are outstanding, he manages to keep the tempo of the beat going and still sing on key. 5/5 this song will give your repeat button a reason.    5. Dead Memories; Corey dedicates all singing to this song, providing an almost serial melodic, and recognizable sound as in Vermillion pt1. Corey reminds us why we need a heart, even if its made of metal... 5/5    6. Vendetta; vendetta happens to have that one thing most metal bands lack, the ability to make me enjoy every lyric the singer delivers. Starting off classic Knot , we are given hard drums that are taken over by some very heavy guitars. this song is an anthem song, rejoice in its appeal. 4/5    7. Butchers Hook; And here we are, every album has to have one, at least one song that is just plain horrible. \\"Someone's bad idea\\", \\"hey even Metallica misses cue\\". All true statements. Nothing is perfect, and usually one apple is usually rotten. the problem with this song, is the sloppy tempo, its hard for me to follow let alone rock my head to. The chorus seems to mismatch with the song entirely, and while I  like the lyrics they just aren't presented well, due to the very weak beat. 3/5    8. Gehenna; I feel this might be the next single, the slow temp and melodic and haunting vocals just make me think this track belongs on a movie preview (see Max Payne, Watchmen previews). Just a wonderful track, I enjoyed every haunting sound and corey manages to sound like a derranged maniac ala Vermillion. 5/5    9. This Cold Black; Hard, Heavy, Metal, Screaming. The song starts with a lead guitar riff that sinks its notes into your brain. Hard to forget, even harder to remember. This track is pure old school slipknot. 5/5    10. Wherein lies continue; Corey has found his niche, Hard metal thrashing, with singing in between. This is something I enjoyed listening to Vermillion, Wait and Bleed, and Before I forget. Truly a great artist. Corey delivers, honestly this track is the best of both dimensions. 5/5    11. Snuff; You all have heard Vermillion pt 2., this song is its rival. enuff said, Snuff delivers the songbird like vocals of corey in a very sick, sadistic way, that I cant seem to stop playing this song. 5/5    12. All Hope is Gone; We have reached the end. and what an ending indeed. thrashing, and screaming, Corey feeds us this lovely dish with a side of hard drums and a healthy helping of guitar riffs that let us know why we love Slipknot. 5/5    In conclusion I find myself liking the band more, now that they decided to actually use singing as a form of delivering great songs. Its still hardcore and its still Slipknot. you can dislike the singing but you can't deny the lyrics. Corey shows that he is a genius with words, and is more than a one trick screaming pony. I leave anyone reading this with a saying; \\"Sounding like everyone else is easy, sounding like yourself is the most impossible thing in the world\\".    With that, I hope people can see that this is a prime example of a band evolving into an even greater force. This isn't just a simple \\"experiment\\", but merely a form of evolution to which the band has more than complimented. If you truly are a fan this album helps you put things in perspective, it lets you understand that change can be good if that change comes with resolution. Hear the songs for what they are, not for what they sound like, or what they could be. But merely appreciate the songs for the greatness they already have.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore has done it again.  This production --just like his previous works-- more than anything else, is a great service to the public, especially to the people of the United States.  I hope every single person in the USA will make an effort to see this film and, all of them will take action to correct this outrageous disregard of the most essential right of every human being.  It is hard to believe that the wealthiest, the most powerful nation on earth does not have a universal health-care system.  By bringing this highly critical issue to the attention of the masses Mihael Moore has accomplished a great deal.  I am very fortunate to live in Canada, one of the countries he visited to show how a decent health-care system does --and should-- work.  Ted Kennedy tried very hard to make the same point several years ago; apparently his effeorts have not made any difference.  I hope this film will create a positive change.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking dawn is the fourth installment in the twilight series. I thought that this book was the perfect way to end the series. Stephenie Meyer ended everything in this thrilling series the right way. Bella and Edward are finally happy and together. Jacob is still friends with Bella, he also found his true love, and he and Edward have finally worked out there problems. Also all the Cullen's are together.  Stephenie put in twist and turns during this whole book making it impossible to put down. First with the wedding and Jacob showing up and fighting with Bella. Then when Edward and Jacob making a deal, so Bella wouldn't die. After that there is a huge fight that the Cullen's have to get there friends to come fight with them. Not to mention Bella finally becoming a vampire. The best part is that after all the fights and the drama it still has a happy ending. This is by far the one of the best love stories that was ever told. I highly recommend this book.

The story carried me along so easily.  I could really relate to Rosie Dunn.  What a woman.<br /><br />Defintely one of my favourites.
B000007UTN|4.0|I just bought this reissues LP this weekend! and having seen only one review of the vinyl reprint i thought i would add my 2 cents. 1st the packaging is great these LP make CDs look boring, nice gate fold and you can see all the art work that is so small it the cd booklet and now it is huge and awesome.  2ed the sound That is my we are buying all this s@#t again right!  Sounds great the highs are higher and the lowers are lower just like  my life j/k!  3ed it is just a cool thing the have and revisit.  I think the whole ritual of putting the record on sitting down and listening to the recording instead of driving or washing dishes or working out or what ever.  So in summation i  would give the music 5 stars the vinyl 4 stars so there you have it!     ps this also applies to the bends
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is the second pair of Sony MDr-W08L's I have purchased and actually bought 2 this time so I would have an extra set.  They are great for use during workouts as they don't fall out of your ears like earbuds  do but they are still very lightweight.  Great bass and sound.  Can't beat the price either!
B0013L2EDQ|2.0|I had a very hard time getting through this book.  I really liked all the characters but the plot was over the top.  Every element you can think of was thrown in - bioterrorism, religious artifacts, natural disasters, historical figures, love story, parents in peril - and it was just too much mixed together to really enjoy the sotry.
031606792X|4.0|I really did enjoy Breaking Dawn, don't get me wrong. But I felt it was a little contrived. I think that my positive opinion about it is probably only because I'm the kinda girl who likes happy endings. I felt it kinda dragged on a bit, but all the same I still enjoyed it. But I have felt the Twilight Saga was always a bit contrived, but for some reason I have an affinity for child/teen novels (Harry Potter, Charlie Bone, Twilight etc.)    I feel that if Meyer wasn't busy writing The Host and getting that off the ground, she might have been able to develop more in Breaking Dawn and give us more of what we expected.
B001BR5F4C|4.0|Right off the bat, I'll start by saying that Amazon chose to be \\"less than honest\\" about this set when I bought it. They showed it as \\"NC-17\\", and said they \\"couldn't verify my information\\" when I submitted a correction after having received \\"R\\" versions.<br /><br />That said, this set is decent, though I really expected a lot more from Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The video transfer is incredibly sharp, albeit somewhat oversaturated... so you might want to back down the color on your display. Some will probably say that the saturation is intentional, but having seen this in the theater and on DVD, I'm going to go ahead and disagree.<br /><br />As far as audio goes, Buena Vista was nice enough to give us uncompressed 5.1, though I'm incredibly disappointed that there was no DTS track, as it was indeed available when this movie was in theaters (so it's not like there would have been a ton of work involved in providing it, or that there wasn't enough space on the disc for it). That said, the uncompressed audio is better than average, though, much like the color, I'm reasonably sure an audio engineer was given instructions along the lines of \\"Make it thump more! This is Blu-Ray!\\", resulting in some unbalanced effects.<br /><br />Don't buy this set if you're looking for extras. There really aren't any. You get a couple of songs by the 5,6,7,8's (the band playing at Charlie Brown's place) and some 480p trailers for other Tarantino movies.<br /><br />If you already own the DVD set and have a decent upscaling DVD player, this Blu-Ray set isn't going to offer you very much more than you already have. But at the price Amazon's offering the set at, it isn't like you're getting ripped off. If you don't have these discs on DVD already, it's probably worth the extra money to get the Blu-Ray discs.
B000R8YC3G|3.0|Hot Fuzz rocked, but this one was a little slow and lacked a plot. It wa s a little long winded. It did have some funny lines that made me laugh out loud, but it was not as funny as I thought it would be. PQ/AQ 4/5.
B001AIRUOU|1.0|I own this and I found out that the Digital Copy disc ain't worth buying this DVD set. You can get the one disc version of this movie and get all the same bonus features. This is really not worth buying. You can only use the Digital Copy disc and code 1 time and than you are unable to again. This collector's edition is a waste of money and Disney should be sued by anybody who bought this cause it isn't worth it. Why in the H*** put out a Digital disc that can only be used 1 time? what happens if someone's computer crashes or they accidentally delete it? What should they do waste more money to get it.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SET IT IS A RIP OFF.
B00133KFGW|2.0|August Rush is set around the feel-good magic of mystical musical bonds that occur between 3 of the 4 main characters of the movie; a family physically separated but spiritually aware of one-another. Their link is pure wondrous fantasy and there's nothing wrong with that, but then we are presented with the mechanism with which the 3 will be united -- it is there that I find a huge difficulty in liking this movie.<br /><br />I love music as a listener and performer and have always felt that it has a magical quality to it. But a good fantasy (for me) always takes an element of magic, such as the mystical musical bond between Lyla and her son and her one-night-stand lover, and presents its protagonist with some sort of challenge to perfect the magic.<br /><br />Yet no fantasy challenge arises. Lyla's son, Evan, is simply magical, except when he's not, who's to tell? His instant, and I do mean instant guitar and pipe organ playing skills and musical notation skills were pure fantasy without effort. Evan, aka August Rush picks up a guitar for the first time and with no fine motor skills training channels the ghost of Michael Hedges (check him out if you liked Evan's style of guitar playing; frankly, I was offended by the artistic rip-off as the physically demanding and technically challenging techniques that Evan just pulls out thin air were invented by the late Mr. Hedges). He is befriended by a kindly reverend and a young girl, a refugee in the church, and immediately learns how to read and score music with no tutelage. There were opportunities to spend a few movie minutes here and there to make Evan's transformation from a non-musician to a guitar playing god more believable, but the director went for a lazy  prefab genius/magic boy route more often then not. Even when Evan/August winds up a musical \\"student\\" at his mother's alma-mater, Julliard, he is shown to be teaching the teachers almost from the get-go; no strain to perfect his magical musical ability.<br /><br />But there is something, nay, somebody in Evan's way, somebody preventing him from uniting with his mystically gathering family. That somebody is a money-grubbing, lost-soul ex-musician, played by Robin Williams. This promising character could have added much more to the story. How did he lose his soul, could he get it back? Did he have a mystical tie to Evan's parents other than mere happenstance? In what way was his nickname, the Wizard, warranted? We'll never know, the character is instead used as a throw away impediment to Evan's quest to find family. And is about as menacing as a junk yard dog on a leash when he's not being a sympathetic character. In short, the \\"wizard's\\" story is a tepid voyage to nowhere.<br /><br />So August Rush veers between reality and pure fantasy, with neither faction presented with any sort of conviction -- no hint of real struggle or conquest or even surprise as Evan is united with his mother and father at the end.<br /><br />I find it interesting that there are so many high ratings for this movie, while at the same time reviewers frequently acknowledge that this movie is full holes (Those mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive list). Is this the price of a nice feel-good movie; to be sold on the idea that intellect and emotion are entirely at odds? If there's anything we should have learned by now from Disney/Pixar, it's that you don't have to overly dumb-down stories to your children to get them to appreciate fantasy and happiness; and adults shouldn't have to dumb-down their expectations for movies that appeal to all.<br /><br />Great heart-warming spiritual premise merits two and a half stars, but the vision is sorely muddled by the half-baked efforts of the writers and director.ng, nay, somebody in Evan's way, somebody preventing him from uniting with his mystically gathering family.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|So I have come late the the party and just discovered Firefly.I am not into this type of TV usually. Don't like buffy, or Babalyon 5 or shows of that nature. That said I have to admit that in my 31 years I have NEVER found a story, a setting , and a cast that has touched me as this one did. I love both SI-FI and westerns and so this was a dream come true. Like the typical guy I signed on for the action, the gun fights and the girls,(I guess I'm most like Jayne then)but as I watched the show I found myself most enjoying the scenes of simple interaction between the characters. It has the best writing and diologe on TV, hands down. Having just found the series I was crushed when I learned of the shows history and ultimatly it's premature demise. I wish I could say that I was a part of the fan movment to save the show but I was not. I can tell you that even now years later I plan to start sending letters and emails anyway even in the blind hope of a resurection. This show is simpley that good. Thanks to Joss and the cast.

0767811070|4.0|I was blown away by `Boyz `N the Hood' mainly because I really wasn't expecting anything particularly smart.  I mean, in all honesty can you say that the films title or descriptions would ever lead you to believe it would have some validity?  It does though, have a lot of validity.  Not only is it a well acted (for the most part) film but it is a really socially important film about race relations both with those outside your race, but more importantly with those within your race.  Exposing the hatred and senseless violence that pollutes certain communities, `Boyz N' the Hood' really rises above most films of this nature (take that Spike Lee) and creates a film that is emotionally investing and in the end one that is respectably sincere.<br /><br />The film tells the story of young Tre Styles who goes to live with his father Furious after one school screw-up too many sends his mother over the edge.  Growing up in a neighborhood less than admirable, Tre learns a lot from his father's guiding hand about bettering himself and not becoming what his friends were destined to become.  As he grows up alongside brothers Ricky and Doughboy, Tre is able to see how having a father has really kept him separate from his friends and has helped create a respectable heart in him.  His views on women and drugs and gang violence differ drastically from that of his close friends for they had no strong arm to guide them, to take care of them and thus mold them into better people.<br /><br />The film flows almost without much of a plot for quite a while.  Tre is falling in love with his girlfriend but is afraid to consummate that love for fear of having a child.  Ricky is striving to get a scholarship thanks to his talent as a football player.  Doughboy has created a successful life of crime for himself and is constantly waging war with a rival gang.  All the while Furious is continuing to instill in his son wisdom beyond his years, that is, until the final act of the film roles around and no amount of wisdom can prepare Tre for the choice he has to make.<br /><br />What I respect about `Boyz `N the Hood' is that it is realistic and honest, as apposed to a film by Spike Lee or Tyler Perry which are almost shameless (at times you can remove that word almost) in their attempt to sugar-coat things.  `Boyz `N the Hood' is gritty and sincere, even when it's falling short of its own standard.<br /><br />The acting is for the most part very well done.  Ice Cube is one of the only singer-turned-actor examples to think of that has really paid off.  His portrayal of Doughboy, especially in that final scene, is very strong, mature and heart touching.  Laurence Fishburne is wonderful as Furious as well.  I usually find Laurence to be somewhat monotone and stale, but here he is fantastic.  Morris Chestnut is very real as Ricky, touching upon his own charisma to create a touching and lovable character.<br /><br />Then there is Cuba Gooding Jr.  In all honesty, when his name came up on the screen my brother-in-law said \\"he's not cool enough for this movie\\" and I had to agree.  He seems very out of place.  I've never been a fan of his, although I thought that his Oscar winning performance in `Jerry Maguire' was wonderfully outlandish, and I felt that his turn here was forced and uninteresting.  He didn't bring any of the spunk and fervor he brought to `Jerry', granted, this was five years before that performance.  His breakdown after his near arrest was very over-the-top and is the films one real poor moment, for it stabs at the credibility of the film in general.  The scene is understandable in its construction, but Gooding's delivery of the material is horrendous.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that this is a film you really should see.  It is socially important for it touches upon truths that so often get swept under the rug for a chance at shifting blame.  This is a film where individuals stand up and say \\"we can make a difference if we really want to\\" and encourage others to do the same.  I will admit that knowing how sincere the film turned out to be I do wish that they had explored a little deeper the darker side of things, maybe fleshing out Doughboy's side of things a little more, but honestly, `Boyz `N the Hood' leaves little to be upset about.dmit that knowing how sincere the film turned out to be I do wish that they had explored a little deeper the darker side of things, maybe fleshing out Doughboy's side of things a little more, but honestly, `Boyz `N the Hood' leaves little to be upset about.
B001E75QGG|4.0|Let me be very fair by stating that this film is beautifully recreated in Blu-Ray with all the special effects and sound seemingly amplified! It's a beauty!<br /><br />However, the fourth installment of \\"Indiana Jones\\" is a disappointment. The entrance scene with Indiana and his fedora in a silhouette is a nice start, but the film's plot quickly disintegrates into implausibility. Now, I do understand the Saturday `Flash Gordon' type stories where credibility is stretched for entertainment, but this film stretches and breaks. Marion is back (Karen Allen) and her entrance is so very welcome, but she soon disappears into a one-dimensional character. Indiana's new side-kick (Shia LaBeouf) misses his mark and only annoys when constantly slicking back his hair (thanks to George Lucas). John Hurt is such a great actor, it hurts to see him delegated to barely speaking, but his face tells a lot more than the dialogue around him. Cate Blanchett is thoroughly believable as the commie villain, but her character is also `dumbed-down'.<br /><br />The action scenes are not as inventive as previous Indiana Jones films (remember the first 15 minutes of \\"Temple of Doom\\" from the dance number, \\"Anything Goes\\" to jumping out a three-story building to a car chase to jumping out of a plane in a raft to sliding down a snow peaked glacier to dropping off a cliff into a wild raging river and on and on...?) There is nothing like that here. There is a floating car with our heroes that goes over numerous gigantic waterfalls and no one gets hurt (only a little wet). The car chase scene on the cliff never gets too exciting and to see LaBeouf swinging on vines ala Tarzan is just TOO much to have the audience believe. Do I need to add the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that is blown a mile away? And finally, I apologize, but the \\"Close Encounters\\" ending is fairly dramatic, but with all that torrential water gushing, mountains collapsing and the winds hurling around the characters, why don't their clothes or hair move at all? It is the most egregious CGI overlook since George Lucas (\\"Return Of The Jedi\\") had Mark Hamill fly through the redwood forest on the air-scooters and the ferns didn't move at all.<br /><br />Like I said, I tried to be fair. It is still a great film compared to most that is out there. But when Lucas and Spielberg set the bar SO high with previous works, they can't top themselves and that hurts - kind of like growing up and realizing your heroes are really ordinary people. But it's still worth watching (or owning), if only for its historical significance and the beautifully filmed scenery (in Blu-Ray!!!) Get the first three in Blu-Ray as well (when available).

B000BQ7BX2|4.0|There are no weak links in this chain.  Though this cycle did not sweep away all of my previous favorite Mahler recordings, it did give them all stiff competition.  Listening to all of these recordings in sequence over a few days was a really enjoyable experience from start to finish.  I am not so certain that the cycles by some better known Mahler conductors would have passed this test.  I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|-This review pertains to the Jaws: 30th Anniversary Edition DVD-    In 1975, a young up and coming director named Steven Spielberg ([[ASIN:B000063UR5 Duel]] and [[ASIN:B00028HBIE The Sugarland Express]]) became America's premier filmmaker with his motion picture adaptation of Peter Benchley's novel, [[ASIN:1400064562 Jaws]]. Upon its theatrical release Jaws quickly became a cultural phenomenon, embraced by critics and audiences alike. It's hard to believe, but it's been over thirty years since the film debuted and Jaws still keeps people away from the water. The film's brilliant exploitation (or exploration, depending on how you look at it) of our primal fears of drowning and of being eaten alive by a natural predator is still stunningly effective. And though the mechanical shark in the film may look artificial or quaint when compared to today's advanced CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery), the film remains a chilling and exhilarating adventure/thriller.    When a Great White shark begins stalking the waters of Amity, a New England coastal town, and kills a teenage girl, Police Chief Martin Brody (who suffers from a fear of the water) wants to close down the beaches, but he is overruled by Mayor Vaughn. After two more fatal shark attacks Brody hires Matt Hooper, a wealthy ichthyologist from the Oceanographic Institute and an eccentric local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down and exterminate the shark. Brody says good-bye to his wife, Ellen and their two children, and he joins Hooper and Quint on a small, dilapidated fishing vessel called the Orca. It doesn't take this mismatched trio long before they encounter the deadly 26-foot shark, which repeatedly attacks their boat. Soon it becomes apparent that the hunters are the hunted and that this predator can, not only outsmart them, but outrun them as well. Even after numerous attempts to stop the shark, their efforts are thwarted time and time again. When the shark strikes their boat, creating a large leak, Brody, Hooper, and Quint realize that they are ill equipped to face this natural wonder of evolution, this perfect killing machine.    The film features a superb cast including Roy Scheider as the neurotic Police Chief, Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as the charmingly sarcastic Hooper, Robert Shaw as the stubborn Quint, Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as the persistently unwise Mayor Vaughn. The entire cast gives multi-faceted performances and Robert Shaw, in particular, is wonderful as the salty, cynical, and fiercely competitive Quint.  Without minimalizing the talents of the fantastic cast, the film's greatest stars are those behind the camera. Steven Spielberg was aided by special effects expert Robert A. Mattey, experienced shark photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor, production designer Joe Alves, and director of photography Bill Butler. The film's screenplay was written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb and benefited from unaccredited contributions by Howard Sackler, Steven Spielberg, and John Milius. As far as adaptations go, it's unusual for a film's screenplay to live up to the expectations of the fans of the source material. Often an adaptation of a book is disappointing, to put it mildly, but Jaws proved to be an exception. The film, in many ways, is superior to the novel, which at times drifts into the realm of pretentious melodrama.  Jaws was also given a tremendous boost by renowned film composer, John William's brilliant score, which has become instantly recognizable.  The original Jaws film was so successful that it spawned three sequels: the adequate [[ASIN:B00005A8XX Jaws 2]], the regrettable [[ASIN:B00008WFU4 Jaws 3]], and the abysmal [[ASIN:B00008WFU5 Jaws: The Revenge]]. Apparently you can't keep a good shark down. With all of these indestructible sharks out there, it's no wonder that people are still afraid of going into the water.    The 30th Anniversary Edition DVD includes the following bonus materials: the excellent two-hour documentary The Making of Jaws, deleted scenes and outtakes, From the Set vintage featurette, storyboards, production photos, Marketing Jaws, and Jaws Phenomenon image galleries.  Now the film itself is worth the price and with the addition of the bonus material, having this DVD in your collection is a no-brainer.

B00000DQSV|5.0|Notorious is truly one of Duran Duran's best albums of all time. It's funky, upbeat, and perfectly done. A new style gives the boys a more mature, superior sound. Powerful drums, smooth bass, hard-rocking guitars, fantastic synth, and trumpets adding the perfect touch. Simon's vocals are flawless and never disappoint. As for the production, Nile Rodgers is music genius (haven't you noticed everytime DD works with him they do well?) and makes this a masterpiece you'll never forget! Now here's my take on the album:<br /><br />Notorious- The first single off the album. A clear winner, with all the right beats and lyrics! One of their best singles.<br />American Science- We take a little time off and slow down with some lighter tracks. A soft, upbeat pop song with catchy lyrics.<br />Skin Trade- The second single, good pop song with funky beats, but it's not one of my favorites. Can't seem to get into it.<br />A Matter of Feeling- Beautiful ballad. Almost points in the way of \\"Ordinary World.\\" Don't miss this one!<br />Hold Me- Now we get back into the upbeat tracks! Powerful rock track with strong synth. Can easily become a favorite after the first listen.<br />Vertigo- This should've been a single on its own. Some of Nick's finest synth, rocking guitars, and powerful vocals. The dark lyrics match the mood of this song. Chorus is absolutely catchy and I can say this is my personal favorite from the album!<br />So Misled- Another track that delivers, a little more rock than \\"Hold Me.\\" Another powerful track with cool lyrics.<br />Meet El Presidente- This track is much different from DD's earlier works. Interesting work, a latin-inspired tune. Lots of trumpet playing and female backing vocals. It's a good song, but I wasn't really feeling it.<br />Winter Marches On- Easily one of the best tracks from the album. A dark song with powerful lyrics.<br />Proposition- My second best from the album. Another rock track with lyrics that make an argument. Worth the listen!<br /><br />I recommend this album and I promise you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />This IS Duran Duran. Drums, guitars, synth, and Simon's vocals. Not one dominates over the other. Everything is in perfect harmony.n't be disappointed!    This IS Duran Duran. Drums, guitars, synth, and Simon's vocals. Not one dominates over the other. Everything is in perfect harmony.
0385340990|5.0|Since many others have given an outline of what the story is about, I'd just like to say that this is a charming, enjoyable read about another era. It makes you smile many times as you read. It's just so nice to pick up a book and enjoy it all the way through. It keeps winding the reader in.<br />It might even make a good movie.

0812580346|4.0|Having read a number of other reviews here, I cannot lend any weight to any of the criticisms written. I just finished this book a couple of days ago and I found it very satisfying in every way. The story is clever and interesting, the science is top-notch and well delivered, the characters are compelling and reasonably well fleshed-out [its only 300 pages, after all] and it all builds rather nicely to a double-climax [one for Theo and one for Lloyd].  I found it to be a brilliant blend that was easy to read and built nicely throughout. It was hard to put down most nights and I finished it an about half the time it would normally have taken me to read a book this size, which is really about the best thing I can say about any book.
1401300529|2.0|I've been an admirer of Halberstam's for a long time, but I'm no fan of this book. Halberstam gets so carried away by his own prose, that he often commits errors of fact and/or context. In some cases, he produces some notable (and easily checked) whoppers. For example, in one chapter mostly focusing on Douglas MacArthur, he notes that in 1946, Mac was a four star general. Nope. Was awarded five stars in 1944. Worse, Halberstam claims that in the late 1940s, in spite of a growing conservative middle class, the \\"New Deal line\\" held. In fact, the New Deal line was crumbling, as evidenced by the Democrats losing control of Congress in 1946.     Granted, Halberstam is very good at quickly drawing a portrait of a character, of delineating the essence, say, of MacArthur's character (or lack of same). But the errors, the misstatements, and some serious misreadings (notably, of Truman) are very worrisome.     One historian I contacted echoed my concerns: \\"No, you're not wrong about Halberstam. He has a bad rep among serious \\"revisionist\\" historians of the Vietnam war; there's a blistering attack on his long record of sloppy, inaccurate, and biased reporting in Mark Moyar's \\"Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954-1965\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2006).  I think the Fourth Estate canonized Halberstam because he told his colleagues exactly what they wanted to hear, and helped set the stage for one of the most depressing episodes in the history of American Journalism, the \\"covering\\" of the Tet Offensive in 1968 (see Peter Braestrup's \\"Big Story\\" (Westview, 1977).\\"
0316067601|5.0|This was a great book.  Not perfect.  There were some plot holes that I will not go into here.  There is a lot of Anti-Bush rhetoric in the media.  This book gives an excellent account of the other side of the story.  Why we are fighting in the Middle East.    I would LOVE to see a follow up book after Afghanistan is stabilized.  How the area is changed?  Then I think that the war in Iraq and Afghanistan will be given it just due.  People will understand \\"this is why we are over there\\".  George Bush will not be seen as a bad President, but one with great foresight.
0802136834|5.0|A must read if you have been enticed by the interesting tale of the period... Perhaps you have read some of the fluffier books with more romance and fictional license.  This is book fills in many of the holes.  This book is a nice enjoyable read with great details that touch on the people in a Titan's wake.      The women come to life.  The politics and decisions that baffle us, centuries later, come into focus as you understand the rival nations and religious reform of the era.  GREAT NOVEL.    This author did research and portrayed the characters factually and clearly.      Her Eleanor of Aquitaine novel is excellent as well.
B000NQDC1A|5.0|I originally bought the vinyl recording when it first came out all those years ago as someone who was greatly interested in studying musicology and becoming a performer. Well, time marched on and I never got to be that musicologist/performer and with the latest technology, this particular recording was closed to me. But now I'm extremely happy to have acquired this CD version! What absolutely terrific music and a most well thought out, informative and enjoyable performance by the Early Music Consort of London. I always was a big fan of David Munrow and what he was doing at the time. And 30 years later it still stands up well and is just as fresh and alive when I first played that LP. I only regret that they didn't reprint the exhaustive book that went along with the original set of LPs. However, I have seen it here for sale at reasonable prices. you must have the book to go along with the music because it shows ALL of the instruments being played as also their history and function as described by Mr. Munrow. It IS a musicological education in and of itself and certainly would advise ANYONE who has more than just a passing interest in the periods of the Middle Ages/Renaissance to buy this CD before it too becomes out of print. This CD certainly should be added to anyone's collection of music regardless if it's based in \\"classical\\" or jazz. A BIG part of musical history not to be missed!
B00006G8G1|1.0|The music on this set is filled with some of Maiden's best work and is played to near perfection.  However, the production and editing of this DVD is terrible.  The concert footage contains a dizzy-ing number of camera shots and completely wrecks the Iron Maiden experience.  For example, on 2 Minutes to Midnight, a song that is approximately 6 minutes long, the average camera shot is 2 seconds long with the longest being about 5 seconds and a large number of shots being 1 second or less.  Image, approximately 180 camera shots in one song. The camera shots change so quickly, that you cannot appreciate the music or the musicians.  The multiple shots get pretty annoying in just a short period of time.  Additionally, the camera shots seem to have no relevance to the moment.  For example, when the lead guitarest is in the middle of a great riff as he played on Blood Brothers, why would I want to watch 1 second of the drummer, 1 second of the crowd, 1 second of the singer, 1 second of the bass player, then back to 3 seconds of the guitar player?  Just leave it on the guitar player.<br /><br />For a full appreciation of an Iron Maiden concert, I recommend the Live After Death DVD.  This DVD better captures the excitement and energy of an Iron Maiden show.<br /><br />As for Rock in Rio, I recommend purchasing the CD instead of the DVD.  The music and sound are fantastic.
B0009A40ES|5.0|American Pyscho was one of those films that makes a person laugh uncomfortably throughout and you just walked away feeling disgusted. That being said it was a film that is definitely an underrated masterpiece.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Those of you looking at this product and reading these reviews have probably already seen all or most of the movies and are considering buying this set because you like them. So ignore all the nonsense and ask yourself just this one question: Is there more value in buying this box set, or in obtaining each of these movies individually? The answer is indisputably in favor of the box set. Not just because the movies are cheaper as a group, but because of all the quality extras you get. I'm not talking about the cheesy poster reproductions and the silly police star, I'm talking about all the interviews and scholarly debates about the social impact of the movies that are included in the extras. By watching these you will discover for instance, why the studio decided to follow Dirty Harry with Magnum Force. Additionally, there is a bonus CD with an interesting feature about Clint Eastwood's career.  Dirty Harry is as popular today as he ever was largely because some of the same problems addressed in the films are still with us today: a justice system where it is difficult for the victims of crime to receive real justice, money and influence buying lenient treatment, rampant political correctness, and a press with an attitude that assumes the police are nearly always wrong when it comes to any high-profile case or any case involving any of the press' pet roster of the \\"oppressed\\". That angered the average citizen then and it angers them now. Dirty Harry knew what to do: you don't coddle the criminal, you eliminate him so he will commit no more crimes. That resonated with a large segment of the population and still does.  I like all the films to a certain degree but my favorites are the very topical Dirty Harry whose Scorpio adversary had real-life parallels in the Zodiac killer, The Enforcer where the rag-tag People's Revolutionary Strike Force had a real-life parallel in the Symbionese Liberation Army, and Sudden Impact where it is delightful to see Sondra Locke actuallyget justice by NOT being charged in the revenge killings of her rapists thanks to a technicality of the sort that usually benefits the criminal.  So, if you're wondering whether or not you should buy Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition, ignore the few naysayers and stick it in your cart. Its a set you'll enjoy for life.

0143039601|5.0|If you're new to Jack Kerouac, this might be the place to start. Many people's first introduction to Kerouac is On The Road. While I love On The Road, I've read pretty much all of Kerouac's novels, and I have to say that The Dharma Bums is my favorite.<br /><br />Indeed, I loved the book enough to write a companion reader for it ([[ASIN:1439204748 The Beat Handbook: 100 Days of Kerouactions]]), so right up front I have a bias and thought you should know about that.<br /><br />In at least one of his letters ([[ASIN:0670861901 Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters: Volume 2]]), Kerouac himself acknowledged that The Dharma Bums was 'really bettern ON THE ROAD' (p. 99).

Nevertheless, it's a very easy read and will take you about an hour to finish the book.
0553062182|2.0|I was really into these theories for a while but now really believe some of these can be re-framed using physiological explanations. Consider High Sensation Seeking (HSS). Could this be explained by ADD or ADHD? Also consider Highly Sensitive Person. Could this be explained by an overactive limbic system ? I came up with these explanations after reading the following books:    1. \\"Healing ADD: The Breakthrough Program That Allows You to See and Heal the 6 Types of ADD\\"    2. \\"Healing Anxiety and Depression\\"   by Daniel G. Amen     Consider that the simplest explanation for something is usually the right one. In this case they would be imbalances in brain function. My respects to Dr. Elaine Aron and I read and bought all the books but addressing the unbalanced brain chemistry has helped the most. My thought are that the insight and knowledge she provides can be applied to the cognitive (mental) half of those treatments.
B000148KK2|5.0|In 2004, Diana Krall tried something different and was savaged for it.    Up until that year, Krall had been riding high. She crept slowly to the world's attention although the jazz clan knew of her long before the rest of us did. Her first breakout CD was All for You, a Tribute to the Nat King Cole trio. After another CD devoted to love songs, Krall exploded on the world stage in 1998 with When I Look in Your Eyes. That CD had the distinction of being the first jazz CD to be nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy. She followed with 2001's The Look of Love, a lush, orchestral album, rich in jazz history with a modern touch. The DVD, Live in Paris, captured Krall at the zeitgeist of this run.    All of a sudden, things in her personal life simultaneously fell apart and found new joy. Her mother died in 2002 as did professional mentors Rosemary Clooney and Ray Brown, the man who helped convince Krall to move from her native Canada to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music. These tragedies might have been worse if not for her newfound love interest Declan MacManus. What? You don't know that name? How about his profession nom de guerre: Elvis Costello. It cannot be coincidence that the confluence of personal loss, personal happiness, and the presence of a brilliant songwriter prompted Krall to try something new on her follow-up. She wrote her own songs.    Krall is, like all artists, a creator. You can't deny that, for example, the Krall version of \\"The Look of Love\\" or gender-swapping of Cole's \\"I'm an Errand Girl for Rhythm\\" are new songs, ones different from other versions out there. But, for all the reasons listed above and others we don't know, Krall felt the urge to create her own work, to say something in her own voice. And the resulting CD is something very special: The Girl in the Other Room.    Krall wrote half of the twelve tracks on this CD with her new husband, whom she married in 2003. In liner notes on her website, Krall comments that she wrote pagesand pages of thoughts, memories, and impressions but it was Costello who trimmed and honed the thoughts into verses and stanzas. What you experience in these songs is an adult woman--not some Top 40 teeny bopper--coming to terms with heartbreak, loss, the meaning of love and family, and romance.    If there's one song that has it all, it's the title track. The main character is alone in a room in a house. The silence closes in on her. She's thinking. She's remembering her mother. The musical arrangement intensifies this feeling, opening with a simply guitar chords by Anthony Wilson. The aural quality of the guitar evokes emptiness. The funeral's over, perhaps, because there's murmuring from a different part of the house. She's looking at her reflection and questioning herself. Later in the song, the same girl is with her lover as they undress and fall together. She questions whether or not they should be together, but she finally realizes life goes on. The girl in the mirror recognizes herself. She's different now, but still the same person she was and always has been. In all, this song is a positive song, one about overcoming calamity and still living as well as possible. It's not a little like us here in Houston as we pick up the pieces after Hurricane Ike and move forward. To stay is to stagnate.    Not every song is about love and loss. There are songs about Krall's new place in life: as a wife, as a seasoned professional. \\"I've Changed My Address\\" shows Krall reflecting on her earlier life playing in jazz bars, sharpening her chops. Now, it's a sports bar. I think we all can relate to this kind of jarring change, where our sepia-tinted memories clash with modern realities. The music evokes the past, coming across as the type of song Krall would have played back in the day, a song that could have found it's way onto the soundtrack of \\"The Fabulous Baker Boys.\\" Not that Krall would ever sulk over a piano. But this song, and her voice, certainly imply that she could.    If you've seen a photograph of Krall, you know she is one of the most beautiful performers out there, jazz field or otherwise. Tabloid-wise, you never heard about her relationships until she hooked up with Costello. However, in her cover of the Chris-Smither-penned tune, \\"Love Me Like a Man,\\" made popular by Bonnie Raitt, a little of her romantic anger busts out. The words are like lashes of a whip, complaints to which, I suspect, many women can attest:        The men that's I've been seeing, baby      Got their souls up on a shelf      You know they could never love me      When they can't even love themselves        I come home sad and lonely      Feel like I wanna cry      I need someone to hold me      Not some fool to ask me why    It's this kind of song that makes us men just mute. We don't know what to say to a woman who's singing like this. And that's the problem. This track features Krall's touring musicians of Jeff Hamilton on drums and John Clayton on bass, still with Wilson on guitar. There's an effortlessness present in this song, a knowing something that you can't get with just studio musicians. These players know each other and push and pull throughout the song like old friends. It's during Wilson's solo where Krall breaks out a couple of \\"yeahs,\\" something that came from within her. Again, modern, over-produced CDs don't usually allow this kind of personal statement. But then, that's what this CD is all about.    \\"Love Me Like a Man\\" is not the only timely cover Krall performs. Tom Waits' \\"Temptation\\" comes across as that silky, snaky tune you'd hear on a late Saturday night, when you find yourself faced with something you know is wrong, something you'd have to come to terms with the following Sunday morning in a church pew. But, damn, it's so good here, in the dark on Saturday night. The Hammond B3 organ, played by Neil Larsen, sneaks in on verse three, a sly reminder of the snake that is temptation. You can't help but wonder if the temptation Krall sings of is the very album she's creating, one that is of her and by her, not necessarily what the jazz community thinks she should create. You get that vibe from her subtle counter melody under Wilson's guitar solo. It's a question that is left unanswered.    My favorite song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Black Crow.\\" In this song, Krall sings of highways, of constant movement, diving down for that \\"something shiny,\\" searching for love and music, trying to find it in every nook and cranny she can. She laments \\"How'm I ever going to know my home when I see it again.\\" You can't help but hearken back to the character in \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" questioning herself as well. It's a well-chosen cover and the soaring solo Wilson delivers is fantastic.    I have mentioned other musicians but I need to turn to Krall's own musicianship on the piano. She is an accomplished piano player but not one who knows only one thing or one style. What this collection of songs--and, by the way, Krall is credited with the music for all twelve songs--demonstrates is Krall's ability to pull from the piano exactly what the lyrics require. That's a benefit of being a composer, singer, and player. She brings out breathy notes for some slower, emotional songs, evoking Vince Guaraldi's sound on \\"Almost Blue.\\" She bangs out octave-based accompaniments in other, broader songs. And her solos express a command of the instrument that rivals few in the jazz world.    After listening to the album, you have to wonder why this CD earned such mixed reviews when it came out and in the four years since. The folks in the jazz tribe certainly loved it when Krall covered old songbook titles but balked when she struck out on her own. Why? Do they just want to pigeon hole her? Ditto for some of the folks who reviewed the CD here on Amazon. They loved her previous CDs when she sang love songs but didn't like this one. Why?    One reason could be our society's tendency toward the simple. We don't often like to think and The Girl in the Other Room requires thinking. Sure, there are a couple of tunes where you can check your brain at the door but the rest, the autobiographical material, calls for listener involvement. There's a saying that a book is never finished until a reader reads it. The same could be said for an album's worth of music. And in The Girl in the Other Room, Diana Krall has challenged us as listeners. She wants to show us her painful journey through the loss of a mother, something we all have to deal with a sometime in our lives. She shows us that loss hurts, it can be debilitating, but there is always hope. A line from \\"Narrow Daylight\\" compactly expresses this hope: \\"Is the kindness we count upon hidden in everyone?\\"    And if you don't want to think too hard about one woman's journey from the valley to the mountaintop, just listen to the music. It's stark, it's expressive, it's tentative, it's soaring. As is this CD. I, for one, hope that Krall delivers another album's worth of songs she herself pens. She's a mother now. I can't help but wonder how that experience has affected her muse. I don't expect it to have the resonance the The Girl in the Other Room has but, then, this CD was a complete surprise. I look forward to being surprised again.    NOTE: The DVD, Diana Krall: Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival, is the visual document of the tour promoting this CD. Nine of the twelve songs from The Girl in the Other Room show up on this DVD. The songs are expanded to allow more soloing and interpretation. Some of the tracks exceed the studio tracks. It's a nice comparison piece to the 2001 \\"Live in Paris.\\" Same artist, different vibe. She's visible happy during both shows but you can't help but wonder if she's just a little more excited about playing her own songs on the Montreal DVD. As a creator, I certainly would be. [...]

0452289963|3.0|It's just possible that Eckhart Tolle may speak to you in a way few spiritual teachers can. It's also possible that he will strike you as egotistical and out-of-touch with the realities of life (see some of the other reviews here).<br /><br />[[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]] was an incredibly important book at one point of my journey. (Please note that I say \\"journey\\" but, as Alan Watts teaches, I do not see life as all about \\"getting somewhere\\" - it's really a dance, not a journey. To really understand that, Google \\"Alan Watts music and life\\" and watch the video.) But back to my point: Tolle was very influential for me at a certain point in my spiritual growth. His writing explained Buddhism to my Western mind better than traditional Buddhist authors. Then I discovered Alan Watts, and explored his writings in depth. That kept me engaged for a time, but then I discovered Jiddu Krishnamurti.<br /><br />That changed everything. It became clear to me that Tolle was simply repackaged Krishnamurti, not just repackaged Buddhism. (You can find entire phrases from Krishnamurti - uncredited, I might add - in Tolle's works.) It became clear to me that Watts (and all Buddhist/Hindu teachers) miss the very point that Krishnamurti teaches: truth is a pathless land. There is no guru, teacher, system, method, practice, religion, etc. \\"out there\\" to save you.<br /><br />Admittedly, not everyone can connect with Krishnamurti. Some find Tolle more accessible. Books are tools for learning. Some work better than others for different people. I have no doubt that The New Earth will help some toward enlightenment better than The Power of Now (although enlightenment is not something you can aspire to, but that is another conversation). I know I enjoyed The New Earth - it was like reuniting with an old friend. I've cited Tolle in my own book ([[ASIN:1439204748 The Beat Handbook: 100 Days of Kerouactions]]), so obviously I think he is worth reading.<br /><br />This is an excellent book by a gifted writer. If you enjoyed The Power of Now, I suspect you'll enjoy this book and likely get some new insights from it. At the same time, I urge you to check out the teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti (e.g., [[ASIN:0060916095 Think on These Things]]). He's not in favor these days like Tolle, but he said the same thing a long time ago.ok by a gifted writer.

B0013D8LCW|4.0|I loved Shelter. It was a beautiful film that I can watch over and over again and it was so close to life. Thank you Amazon for delivering me the DVD well before time and in good condition. I will keep ordering more stuff from you in the days to come.
B000WE660M|5.0|This CD is perfect. Britney explores a kind of eletro music which she has never explored before. Also, the name of the album defines it all: BLACKOUT is all about blocking the bad energies and let only the good ones make it through!<br /><br />The CD kicks off with the amazing and very catchy \\"Gimme More\\", the opening single. We can hear a sexy Britney groaning and provocating shivers with this uptempo beat.<br />Next we have \\"Piece of Me\\", that won 3 moonmans in the 2008 VMAs for its video, including \\"Video of the Year\\" category! Very eletronic song and a real answer to the inconvenient  paparazzis.<br />\\"Radar\\" is the fourth and last single (radio single), produced by Bloodshy & Avant, one of the best of the album. Starts with a noise imitating a radar and tells about a guy who can't be left aside, he is on her radar and there's no escape.<br />The third single, \\"Break the Ice\\", is the hottest and most energic and different from the other things she's done so far, even though as danceable as always.<br />Not as good as the Demo version but still great, \\"Heaven On Earth\\" is one of the only slow songs in \\"Blackout\\", telling about how perfect the loved person is. Very romantic one.<br />The most eletronic and dirty song, \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\\" is a little bit repetitive, but good to dance in a party.<br />The rythm and beats of \\"Freakshow\\" are just incredible! A shame it wasn't a single... Such a waste!<br />In \\"Toy Soldier\\" the beats imitate a march, and it has all an army style. Good song, but ends when it's getting better!<br />The Demo was horrible but this final version rocks: \\"Hot as Ice\\" is amazing, awesome song! Here she claims that she is 'cold as fire and hot as ice, a living legend'! It's true Britney, and we know it better now!<br />\\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" is the BEST. Everyone I know loves this song and got it stuck in their heads for weeks. VERY catchy, sexy and even romantic.<br />The one which is not as good as the rest is \\"Perfect Lover\\". (It is the only Britney song I don't like, by the way.)<br />\\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" is the other one which is slower, and I had wished so much it would enter the album and it did! Besides, it fits perfectly to close the CD (in the american version). Fortunately, in this japanese edition, we still have \\"Outta This World\\", such a cute love song! It must have made it to the american version.<br />This could have been a success if well-worked: \\"Get Back\\". Should have been the first song, too. Its beats are great, definitely a must in the dance clubs.<br />\\"Everybody\\" was way better in the Demo, but interesting for sure.<br />This \\"Paul Oakenfold\\" is the best \\"Gimme More\\" Remix, so good that it comes to close this japanese version of the most awaited album by the QUEEN of pop: Britney Spears.hould I Be Sad\\" is the other one which is slower, and I had wished so much it would enter the album and it did!

074325144X|5.0|This is a book that can change your life. On the surface this book is about \\"harnessing chi\\" to improve your running, but it's more about developing proper technique and developing your run into a meditative experience. This book helps you develop proper foot strike and position, leg bend and swing, posture, lean, arm swing, breathing, focus, developing speed and distance, as well as how to focus your mind on the run and improving. The authors also cover basics of stretching, hydration, nutrition ... everything you need to drastically improve your run. I've been running for four years and have suffered through painful knees and lower back spasms without any significant gains in speed or distance, but in the month since reading this book I've nearly doubled my weekly average and the pains are gone. Truly a life changing book.
0439023483|5.0|This Book was recommended on the Stephenie Meyer (author of the Twilight Saga) website.  She loved it, and I enjoy her work, so I bought it.  This book is an easy read and very good.  The only problem for me was that I did not know going in that this is Book 1 with sequels to follow.  I do not have a lot of patience and hate to wait for sequels to come out.  I was able to describe the book easier to friends that remember an old movie with Arnold Swarzenegger, called \\"The Running Man.\\"  Except this book is about children and not convicts.  In loved it and anxiously awake book 2.
B000AP04L0|4.0|1999's \\"Office Space\\" has become something of a cult classic, with office workers everywhere able to recite their favorite lines from this spot-on comedy.  Ron Livingston stars as Peter, a computer software worker locked into a dreary cubical existance, suffering a condescending and exploitative boss and a meaningless life away from the job.<br /><br />Desperate for a change, Peter tries hypnotherapy.  When the session goes awry, Peter is left locked into a relaxed mode that allows him to cheerfully skip work, chase the girl of his dreams, and subvert the routine of his office.  A consulting team brought in to downside the company becomes the trigger for a fraud scheme hatched by Peter and two disgruntled office mates.  They spring the scheme, only to suffer an attack of conscience (and a fear of jail).  Their ham-handed  attempts to fix things lead to a fateful decision by Peter.<br /><br />The comedy of \\"Office Space\\" is in the knowing details, such as Peter's wearisome commute, in which the other lane always moves faster; the office gnome, laid off five years ago but still shuttling from desk to desk because no one told him; and a perpetually malfunctioning printer.  Jennifer Anniston has a nice role as Peter's spunky new girlfriend, while Gary Cole is superbly hateful as Peter's unctious boss.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" is highly recommended as a classic black comedy.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe is just magnificent, especially if you enjoy Beatles songs. Set in both Liverpool, England and the United States, the film provides a view to the Vietnam War era and the challenges faced by those living lives that were impacted by the death of loved ones during a War that many protested, avoided, and / or despised. There is much political and social unrest going on, we see the Rainbow buses, the issues with drugs, and the social unrest that ends in clashes with police and the assasination of Martin Luther King.     The central characters are played by Jim Sturgess, whose name is Jude and Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Lucy, a beautiful young girl who sees her first love drafted and go to war only to then attend her first ever funeral, as she sees her boyfriend, decorated as a hero... but buried...      Her brother Max, played by Joe Anderson, soon is drafted as well, and her anger at losing those she loves, makes her become part of the protesting groups, at some point endangering her life. All characters move to New York City, where they find an apartment ran by a singer named Sadie, played by Dana Fuchs, who is dating a guitar player by the name of JoJo, played by Martin Luther. As you may be beginning to realize, all names lead to some of the best Beatles songs of our times, and as the plot develops, all circumstances result in listening to our favorite tunes.     These young characters are in turmoil over the war, Jude, who is from England, finds that he has no cause and therefore is able to stay outside of the individual turmoil that is consuming his friends, but he falls in love with Lucy and as she gets deeper and deeper into the groups that are protesting the War, Jude finds himself embroiled in the thick of it and because he is in the USA without the appropriate Visa, he is soon sent back home.     They want to change the world, to make the world a better place, to hold on to the belief that it is all about love and that love is all we need.But the reality is that emotions are too powerful, hatred reigns, misunderstandings are powerful, and the clash leaves many suffering the consequences of the War.     If you like a good dramatic romance, we recommend this movie, but if you simply LOVE Beatles songs like we do, we hope that you obtain this DVD and enjoy excellent music, and a plot that puts the times in perspective for us.  Enjoy!!
0446614459|1.0|I am a Balducci fan. I have read half I dozen of his books and enjoyed them all.  Until now.  No, this is not the worst book I have ever read.  But it is close.    Plot is important.  Great characters and story telling will not keep a poor story afloat.    The story started with a bang and just kept building through the first half of the book.  Then I started to wonder how Balducci was going to pull it all together in the end.  Not well it turns out.  The crazy guy did it.  Peoples lives ruined over a period of thirty years and presidential candidates falling left and right and the reason is.....unrequited love. I wish I was kidding.    The bad taste this book has left me may keep me from ever trying Balducci again.  It was that bad.
B0017MO10U|3.0|Since I'm a huge Stargate fan it's always fun to see this group together.  But I have to admit it was a bit booring und the subject was about the same as in some other episodes.  Back to the Future.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Abso-bloody-lutely sensational! Flippen awesome as we'd say down here in New Zealand!!! If you sat down for an hour listening to this album, you'd be swept off into another world. They've mixed all their greatest songs into 12 tracks. Fantstic. Listen to this. Feel it...
B0002WS3RS|5.0|I'm shocked these guys weren't more popular (maybe they were I'm just too young to know). Catchy tunes performed with trippy, ethereal instrumentation and vocals. Reminds me a bit of early 70's Bowie at times, but more jazzy/jammy and sometimes dark. For me this was the band's studio pinnacle. Their live recordings from this period of the band are also outstanding.
B001DHXT20|4.0|\\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" while not a perfect film, is a much better film that the disastrous \\"Hulk\\" directed a few years ago by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee. In this previous film, Ang and the screenplay writers concocted a backstory involving Bruce Banner's father that wasn't in the comic book, adding a soap opera element that didn't bolster the story, wasted the talents of Eric Bana (who played Banner), Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Sam Elliott, and featured a fight between The Hulk and three genetically altered dogs, including a poodle!<br /><br />This film picks up the thread of the previous film, but to much better affect. The father is thankfully absent, Bana is replaced by Edward Norton, Connelly is replaced by Liv Tyler playing Betty Ross, Banner's girlfriend, and William Hurt replaces Elliott, and plays General Thunderbolt Ross, the army officer chasing the Hulk and Betty's father. Banner is on the run and hiding out in Brazil when he is tracked down by the US Army and has to flee. In the meantime, he has found online a scientist who might be able to reverse the gamma radiation damage that cause Banner to become the Hulk. Tim Roth plays a Special Forces soldier who is willing to do anything to catch the Hulk, including becoming just like him.<br /><br />Although Roth's character becomes The Hulk's comic book nemesis, The Abomination, this movie is not the abomination Ang Lee's film turned out to be. This is a film that should appeal to most Hulk fans and seems more like the kind of film that comic books fans would expect. It's not perfect, but it is much better than the previous film, and makes one hopeful that the series can be continued with films that will be worth watching.
0375707972|4.0|Michael Berg, a young German boy suddenly stricken violently ill one October day by the onset of hepatitis one, is assisted by a kindly middle-aged woman, Hanna Schmitz. Several months later, after Michael has recovered, he returns at his mother's insistence to Frau Schmitz's residence to thank her. Thus begins a \\"reverse Lolita\\" relationship that will mark Berg for the rest of his life and force him (as a representative of his entire post-war generation in Germany) to confront his generation's reaction to the Nazi Holocaust and its perpetrators, his parents' generation.     THE READER is loosely structured into three segments. The first half of the book traces the unlikely yet shocking relationship between the adolescent Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz. In addition to their carnal activities, Michael indulges an apparent whim of Hanna's to read aloud to her. Hannah's abrupt disappearance from Berg's life marks the end of this first segment. The second section of the book picks up ten years later with Michael now a law school student. His university professor asks the class to monitor the testimony in a trial where Berg discovers that Hannah is one of the main defendants, accused of horrific crimes related to a World War II concentration camp. Hannah all but refuses to speak in her own defense and is summarily convicted. Thus begins a renewed, Platonic relationship between her and Michael that manifests in part through Michael's tape recording of more books for Hannah to listen to in prison. In the last section, the book's shortest, Michael takes some modest steps to help Hannah make restitution for some of her wartime actions.     Reading, and literacy generally, figure large in Bernhard Schlink's story. In the Michael/Hannah relationship, it is a favor lovingly bestowed by the young boy but a form of usage by the older Hannah that parallels her use of him in the physical sense. In the prison camp, Hannah forces various young women inmates to read aloud to her as well even as she wields life and death control over them. This revelation during the trial brings Michael to the surprising realization that Hannah was and still is illiterate. Reading aloud while physically apart (by tape recording what he reads) reconstitutes Michael's young adult relationship with the older, imprisoned Hannah. In turn, Hannah finally takes life-changing steps in prison to compensate for earlier deficiencies and to reconnect with Michael in a new way.     Hannah's illiteracy coupled with her complicity in the concentration camp horrors might suggest a sort of criticism on Schlink's part: that the Holocaust was a product of lack of education, of common folk being tricked into acting badly because they didn't know better. More apt might be the interpretation that under the Nazi regime, even the most civilizing human activities, such as reading, were corrupted to serve inhuman ends.     One is also tempted to think that every modern German novel must be a treatment of the Holocaust and its resultant guilt, either directly or by allusion. Schlink's approach is direct, with numerous references to the manner in which Michael's post-war generation should view their respective parents' behavior. Schlink goes so far as to suggest that not rejecting one's parents, regardless what they did during the Nazi era, is morally equivalent to condoning what the Nazis did. By that measure, Schlink's resolution is rather ambiguous. Hannah's ultimate fate seems poetically just. However, Michael's final actions, while modestly inspired, hardly seem adequate to exonerate a generation's sins. Then again, perhaps it is the accumulation of small actions by the common person of Michael's generation that can serve to compensate (to the extent such compensation is even possible) for the horrors created by the accumulation of so many small but horrific actions by the common German citizen under the Nazi regime.     THE READER is an affecting story in which the complex and troubled relationship between two human beings from different generations mirror the complex troubles of an earlier time. The \\"survivor's guilt\\" that plagues Germanys' post-war generation parallels in some interesting ways the issues of race and slavery in the United States.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have to say this is a really good effort of solid metal from Metallica - many ladder rungs above St. Anger in the right direction. Melodies and guitar riffs are very reminiscent of older Metallica despite James Hetfield's at times Load-ish sounding vocals. Guitar riffs don't seem as complex as their 80s material, many straight forward in a particular musical cycle but very thrash metal Metallica. Guitar solos are back here - again you can tell that's Kirk playing with his style and that signature wah-wah, it's nice to hear new Metallica with the solos again. Songs are quite long with song structures resembling the old-Metallica. Even with all the 80s Metallica like stuff on this record, it still sounds new and fresh musically, a new era for Metallica, albeit a better one than St. Anger. Personally I really liked the album and I've listened to it quite a few times for the music. It's definitely not as good as the old Metallica CDs, but it's somewhat of a comeback after Load-St. Anger in a style more familiar to old fans of the band. (Personal favorites: The End Of The Line, That Was Just Your Life, The Judas Kiss)    Okay...now I like the album musically but the production on this album is really bad as you can tell just by ready several of these reviews. Guitar tone sounds fine to me, I can tell it's tube-amp driven but it's very static-y at times and the bass is present...but quite distant and you can only hear it clearly in songs like \\"Cyanide\\" where the bass gets some alone time. Drums are better than St. Anger's drum sound especially with the snare but that bass drum clicks and clicks due to the sound clipping on this album. The vocals are a little quiet here and there and get drowned out at times during heavy parts of songs in choruses where the vocals should be louder (\\"All Nightmare Long\\" is a good example where the guitars seem to sound dominant over the vocals in the chorus). This album has been mixed too loud of volume and there are some fist-pumping moments where the audio just blares static into your speakers even at low volume.  The production to me sounds worse than the Justice album, but better than St. Anger which was more \\"raw.\\" This album is not \\"raw,\\" it's just that the volume of the mix is too loud for CD quality audio.     Overall, 5 Stars for the music and the effort, Welcome back Metallica! But a 2 star for the production. It's not 0 stars for it because at least you can hear everything here and you can make out the entire song completely but it's dynamics have been cut down greatly due to the stupid Loudness War. Petition for a remix on this album!
0375826726|5.0|Yes the third installment in the Inheritance Cycle is absolutely sensational. Of course it's all down to opinion. I won't go into any detail about what actually happens in the book, but I'll give you 8 points as to why this is the best in the series, and possibly the best book I've read.     1. There's no messing around. After a couple of chapters building up the situation, Paolini gets right into it.  2. Paolini has definately matured as a writer. He seems to have learnt how to describe things in shorter bits, but to the same effect if not more so, than what he was doing in Eragon and Eldest. Even when there are certain paragraphs or chapters even, that seem to drag on a bit in character description, it's by no means tedious.  3. The plot is fantastic.  4. The ending is just perfect - leaves you hanging and eager for the next installment, all after an excellently written plot.  5. It's long, but good. As another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't matter how long a book is, as long as (pun not intended) you get enjoyment out of it, and believe me, you get (or I got) a LOT of enjoyment out of reading Brisingr.   6. ACTION!!!. Brisingr is full of action. This time round, Paolini wasn't afraid to kill off a few characters, this all making for a riverting and stimulating read.  7. Many long-awaited questions have been answered, with many more arising from it. Christopher definately excelled in revealing all those long-awaited questions we've been asking ourselves, and in the proccess, created new ones. This definately added to the anticipation of Book 4, and made the book on the whole, a very satisfying read.    And lastly...    8. It lived up to the hype. In fact it exceeded expectations in my view.     There's nothing worse than waiting and waiting and waiting (3 and a bit years in this case) for 'the next book in the series' to come out, and it turns out to be a really disappointing read. I prayed to god Brisingr wouldn't be one of those books, and thankfully, it wasn't.    Brisingr is a real page turner right to the ever-so gripping end. For once in my 'Inheritance journey' I am pleased there will be a fourth book and look forward to the legacy continuing.    Keep in mind that Paolini's still young. He's done extremely well so far, and I expect great things of him in the future.    Brisingr was 'flippen awesome' as we'd say in New Zealand!    BRING ON BOOK 4!!!

0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris writes: \\"In our next presidential election, an actor who reads his Bible would almost certainly defeat a rocket scientist who does not.\\" If Stephen Prothero is correct in his book \\"Religious Literacy\\", which concludes that Americans are illiterate about their own religion, then any \\"implicit\\" presidential requirement of reading the Bible would seem superfluous. Prothero, a professor of Religion, writes that Americans are undeniably religious but also profoundly illiterate about their own religion.    The only thing alarming about Mr. Harris's book is that he actually had to write it. Take a gander at this little pearl (for example): [...] (scroll down for source). Embarrassing.   Now consider Sherri Shepherd of \\"The View\\".  Explain to me how a person can reach middle-age and be uncertain about the curvature of the earth (she does not know if its flat or not) yet resolute about the inadequacy of Darwin's theory of evolution. Explain to me how you can connect with a populace when the preponderance of Christians not only do not read about their own God but they also seem to be unabashedly untroubled by it. Explain to me how to promote reason to an electorate that supports a creationist with silly syllogisms such as: Sarah Palin is the governor of Alaska. Alaska is close to Russia. Therefore, Sarah Palin has foreign policy experience. Lest you dismiss this neo-logic as mere political rhetoric, note the increase in the Republican campaign crowds since Sarah Palin's arrival. Forgive my cynical mood, but I used to be alarmed that Americans did not think; now, I am fearful that they do.    Sam Harris presaged Sarah Palin. If she insist on invoking God's name to support military action, then she must bear the burden of proving God's existence.  Buy the book and support reason before Sarah Palin nukes it.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|This movie took me back to Neeson in the original Darkman movie. Barely controlled murderous anger in a hangdog face.  To find his daughter who has been Taken, Neeson does not back down. Leaving a trail of dead and broken bodies across Paris whether it be cop or criminal.  Non-stop action from start to finish. This one is a keeper.
0375826726|5.0|Just to begin with, I'm not giving anything away here but vague plot structure. No major spoilers to fear.<br /><br />'Brisingr' starts fast, then slows down. After the beginning sequences, Christopher Paolini seems to lose his way a little bit, with a couple long sequences of dialogue that stretch out for a whole chapter. While the dialogue reveals some about the characters, they are hardly revolutionary conversations.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Paolini finds his track, and the book soon begins to get moving (never to slow down) Here, I can praise Paolini, for as the book progresses, the characters gain depth and personality. I found myself really being attached to certain people, as they endured struggles.<br /><br />By the end of the book, I had filled myself happy with a good amount of humor, satisfication, intensity and, of course, plenty of fighting.<br /><br />As a huge fan, I had no trouble getting through the slow passages. For those not so commited, I do recommend, hard as it may be, to perservere, for Brisingr is truly something to be experienced. By the end, you will be happy and wanting more.<br /><br />Four and a half stars, and bring on Book 4!
055358894X|5.0|I recently started this book at the beginning of the semester and can't put it down!  It is a hell of a fun ride of a novel.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy novel.  Great new author, can't wait to read what he has ahead for us.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park is one of the best Crichton film adaptations thus far. Though the screenplay is only marginally faithful to the plot of the novel, the basic premise, people being hunted by prehistoric beasts in a tropical paradise, remains intact.<br /><br />The animatronics and computer technology used to bring the film's dinosaurs to life have aged remarkably well, and the action sequences remain as gripping as ever. The fantastic video quality and available Dolby audio makes for a great viewing experience on wide-format TVs and surround sound systems. DVD extras are sparse for a 'Collector's Edition', but I normally don't care for special features anyway.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite films and it was certainly a crowd pleaser when it was released in 1993. Spielberg keeps the introductions relatively brief and once the action starts, it continues pretty much unabated until the closing credits. His knack for giving the audience what they want creates a few glaring continuity issues (ex: The T.Rex paddock seems to be at road level when when the T.Rex walks through the fence and between the two cars. Moments later, Lex and Grant must rappel down into the paddock, which is now a long drop down from the road.) but the film is so enjoyable that one hardly notices them.<br /><br />The relatively one-dimensional characters are nevertheless filled out nicely by the cast, with Wayne Knight in a great performance as Dennis Nedry and Sam L. Jackson adding his trademark, smoke enveloped cool. I can highly recommend this film and DVD version.
0385751532|1.0|... in the negative meaning of the word.    After hearing a lot of good about this book and seeing on the cover it is \\"soon to become a major movie\\" I decided to pick it up before it would hit cinema. I wish I hadn't.     Why?  1) The plot is very thin and you can see the end -dramatic as it is- coming halfway through the story.   2) The plot is also very unbelievable. Two boys meeting on a silent spot for over a year in a place like Auschwitz? And oh yeah, exactly on a place where there's a hole in the fence??   3) There are a lot of continuancy errors in the writing (e.g. on one page it is said that he has forgotten the names of all his friends, but on the page before that he mentions them all)  4) And this point is the worst for me (because of this it was impossible for me to feel one with the character and it kept irritating me througout the book): Out-with (Bruno, the 9-year old boy through whose eyes the story is told, thinks this is the name of the camp). It took some time before I realized what was meant with it. And why? Because I thought Bruno was a German boy. And there is no way a German boy would understand Auschwitz as Out-with. The camp would have to be called Ausmitz or something like that. So either Bruno is a bit deaf or he thinks in English.    The only positive thing I can think about this book is that it is easy reading and it will take only two hours of your time.

B001BKXUOQ|2.0|I was a huge fan of Slipknot's first album. It absolutely ROCKED. There was not a song on that album that I did not like, let alone could listen to. In fact, many of the songs on that album are still on my playlists to this day. I enjoyed the fast tempo, brutal lyrics and hints of vocal sophistication (without sounding strained) of all of the songs, particularly prosthetics, surfacing and (sic).      Fast forward to 2008, and lest you think of me as some stubborn fan, I had expectations of a changed Slipknot that still focused on fast, brutal delivery of songs with a good mix of vocals that still felt unstrained, and uniquely vicious. I mean, I was not looking for a repackaging of the self-titled album, but a maintenance of the same STYLE.     All Hope is Gone is a nearly complete abandonment of the STYLE of Slipknot in lieu of a progression towards Corey's domination of the band's substance. Yeah, Stone Sour is your real passion, but does it have to pervade ALL of your music from here on out? Did we really need a Slipknot slow song (Snuff), or a Slipknot remix (Vermillon part III (three parts too many, IMO))? Yes, Slipknot has literally sunk so low as to become the mainstream band that they originally criticized. IF they ever produce another album again, leave the slow stuff and remixes to Kanye West, please.    The only redeeming feature of this album is psychosocial, and it is the hook that I chomped down on while waiting for this album to be released. Finally! A song that is a) new and b) maintains the Slipknot style with subtle twists! I will still play psychosocial in my regular rotation of awesome metal; however, I will do so with a sour (pun intended) taste in my mouth.    I actually like some of Stone Sour's stuff, but for Slipknot to mirror their style and substance is an atrocity to me. It would be akin to Slayer playing a soft Britney Spears cover song with clean vocals. It just doesn't fit with the focus of the band, at all. It's just too damn bad thatthe band doesn't realize this, or that they just don't care.      I gave this album, as a whole 2 stars, but psychosocial gets 4 stars from me.

031606792X|5.0|As you all know (or should know) Breaking Dawn is the fourth and final book in the Twilight Saga.    It starts in Bella's point of veiw for the first few chapters. Even though I had just started reading it, I could feel something different, something strange about Breaking Dawn. I could tell that it would be unlike any of the the other books.     The first part of the story describes Bella's wedding, and then soon after, her honeymoon. Don't worry, there are no bad scenes and it is perfectly safe to read it, i assure you. You are hit with a HUGE surprise and then about a page after it, you've swapped point of veiws.    You are now in Jacob's shoes. The Book of Jacob was something I had to force myself through. No offense to you Jacob lovers but I just found it alittle slow and somewhat boring, but I understand Meyer's need to switch the POV and I am glad (to an extent) to have seen from Jake's point of veiw and undrstand better how his mind works.    Then, your hit with another surprise, and immediately swapped back over to Bella's POV (thank goodness). The story continues.    Very different, very surpising.    But I did love it and recommend it to everyone who has read the first three books.
B0002B77OE|1.0|I've had it of describing what the \\"loudness war\\" is. Just Google the expression between quotes and you'll get tens of thousands of results to peruse. So I'm just going to say that this release features the worst type of \\"loudness war\\" mastering, when the audio volume is pushed beyond the CD format specification limits and \\"clipping\\" (loss of parts of the audio) occurs. These comments refer to the mono releases (Snapper's \\"jewel case\\", Repertoire's and all the Japanese releases) - the stereo (Snapper's digipack) release is mastered within the CD's dynamic range, but the mix is very annoying, with vocals on one channel and instruments on the other.
0375826726|5.0|This is a pretty good book.  I have read the 1st two and this pretty much follows the same path the other two set.  It ties up a few loose plot points and leaves a few more open questions for the next book.  I can tell that book  4 is looking to be fantastic and I cannot wait to see how it all ends.  Eragon gets a lot more powerful with his magic and I like how Saphira has a lot more personality.  There is a lot more character dialog in this book and you can see how Christopher is improving in his writing abilities.  All in all I would highly recommend this book to anyone that takes it for what it is.  A young adult fantasy novel.  If you don't take it too seriously you will find it a very enjoyable, easy, entertaining, yet well written read.  Have fun with it!
B001AJVR5M|5.0|I bought this CD for my 12 year old granddaughter, and all I can say is that I am now the most groovy grandma around!  I received it on the exact day it was promised, and I was so excited to be able to give it to my granddaughter on the exact date I promised to give it to her.  Thank you for always being so reliable!!
B000YABIQ6|2.0|About 2.3 stars for this.  A few episodes in the middle (Babylon, The Hobo Code) were quite good as the burgeoning counterculture crept in, but the first three you have to force yourself to watch the same way as if you were standing guard or something, and the last three weren't much better.  We live in an age where the standards for television are higher than the standards for feature film are, and as such, I can't go along with all the rave reviews here.  The pacing is off, the plot points seem a bit disorganized, and the acting leaves some to be desired.  Go ahead and watch it though, after all.....it won an EMMY......lol
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|...it's Rush!      Yes, hundreds of thousands of fans turned out for both legs of the Snakes and Arrows tour and what a tour it was!  True musicianship! Three true professionals doing what they love at their best - playing their music for their fans as only Rush can!  I am so stoked and so excited!  221 minutes of one of the greatest rock bands of all time!    So, to the naysayers, before you even begin...  Yes, us Rush fans can grade this as a 5-star product before it is released because we know it is.  Many of us experienced it in 2007 and 2008.    Thank you Rush, for over 35 years of quality music and incredible shows!
1400082773|5.0|This book, which I read twice, helped me understand the background of Barack Obama which has prepared him in a most fundamental way to run for president at this time in history.  He embodies unity in diversity from his \\"black\\" father and \\"white\\" mother, his upbringing in another culture in Indonesia, to his education in a culturally diverse Hawaii, with strong Grandparents representative of American values, and then on to LA and then NY and Chicago.  He carries the back African strength that has not been influenced by slavery, and his position now is symbolic and a wonderful outcome to the years of disempowerment the black community has suffered in our country.  The book is inspirational, insightful and a real treasure.
B001G55JEK|5.0|This silent classic is the original DRACULA adaptation. Some say it is the most frightening one. Taking Bram Stoker's novel and turning it into a masterpiece. Some names had to be changed around from the novel when Stoker's wife found his novel was being filmed without proper permission. Count Orlok, the rodentlike vampire is perhaps the most animalistic screen portrayal of a vampire ever filmed. Defiantly a must have if you are into horror movies.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Brilliant. All I need now is the trilogy on Blu-Ray. This music is the best film soundtrack ever composed. It is the only one that sticks out to me from the thousands of movies I have seen. Love it, love it, love it. It is sooooo expensive but who cares, it is Lord of the Rings!!!
B0014DBZT2|4.0|I am embarrassed to say that I have just barely discovered Nick Cave! I had heard of him before but never really listened to him.  My husband bought this album and had been playing it in the background and like most of my husbands music I tried to ignore it.  But luckily I could not!  My favorite song is Moonland.  Nick Cave has this sort of sultry sexy voice (which so totally does not go with image) and I love title track.  Midnight man is also great.  This album is funny, witty, and smart.  I can't believe my husband and both like it!  marital bliss when it comes to music finally!<br /><br />to top if off we got to see Nick Cave in SF this past weekend and he was awesome!  he played lots of songs off this album and they were just as good live.  the band performed amazing live with funky instruments and Nick played the audience so well.  Truly a great album and a great band.  I can't wait to listen to more of their stuff.

B000002PCS|5.0|SOMEWHERE IN TIME.  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM. A PERSON THAT APPRECIATES MUSIC THAT IS SO SENSUAL AND YET SOOTHING TO THE MIND. THIS IS TRULY ONE OF A KIND TYPE OF MUSIC THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH FRIENDS AND OR FAMILY MEMBERS. MY MOTHER LOVED THIS ALBUM SO MUCH I HAD TO ORDER HER THE SAME ALBUM. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE MOVIE;THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE AND IS A CLASSIC IN IT'S OWN RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY LOVE BOTH OF THEM.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|I thought the second half of this movie was just great. Fun and loads of action. I loved John Goodman in this film. He pulls the character off perfectly. He's really the shining light in the film.<br /><br />The first half of the movie bored me to tears. They WAY over complicated the story. I felt like I was in a college lecture class at times. Way too much talking that just seemed to go on and on. I don't care about the history of blah blah blah. This is Speed Racer. The main character's name is Speed. And he races. Why over complicate that?<br /><br />That aside, I loved the races, I loved Racer X, and I really want a Speed Racer jacket.
0375812024|5.0|I bought this book in preparation for my 2 year old son's first plane ride to grandma's house. We have several Richard Scarry books, so he is used to the chaotic array of images, and this is the book that he goes to several times a day...asking for the plane book.     He picks out new things every time and I often find him sitting on the floor with this book open all on his own. He has started talking about \\"plane to gramma's\\" pointing at the same plane every time. He then walks over and points to a picture of his gramma. If nothing else, it was a great way to help him make logical sense of the fact that his grandparents are far away. When he wants to think about them, all he has to do is pull out this book to remember the plane ride to their house.     Cute book, and great teaching value for the bargain price.
B000F5FR0S|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Lehane's Shutter Island.  The characters are very interesting and keep you in suspense -- what next!!!  I have read both Mystic River and Shutter Island and really enjoyed the latter much more.  I did not pick up on the clues in the story and never guessed how it would end.  This does tend to be a horror story with no ghosts or supernatural types.  Since it takes place in a mental institution, this makes it even more intriguing and mysterious.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to more of Lehane's books.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|This is an awesome movie and is an even better purchase. This dvd comes with great special features including a featurette outlining the entire non-fictional investigation of the \\"the Zodiac killer\\". This movie keeps you second guessing yourself at all times as to who the killer is. Awesome movie. Worth the money.
6304806434|5.0|I was very pleased with the service I recieved from amazon.com when I purchased the dvd \\"Con Air\\".  The movie sells itself because it is a great movie!  However the price, service and shipping service make a real difference.  I have found that amazon.com beats all the competitors that I currently shop with.  I always check amazon.com to see what their price is before I buy a DVD on-line. I also need to mention, amazon.com gives you a tracking # so that you can follow your order as it goes thru the process of being sent to you.  If you have any questions regarding your purchase, just put in your tracking # and you will be able to check on the product you purchased at amazon.com.     Thank you Amazon.com for great service and a great price.    Sincerely,  Dorothy Reamer

B00003CX9W|4.0|This is a great dvd but the price is nothing I would pay again for a musical that old.
B000Z1LOBI|5.0|I own the re-release by Prosthetic. Oh man! This is full of crunchy riffs and powerful grunting vocals from Chuck Billy. You bet it is like no other Testament release, but these guys excel on this thrashy death metal variant anyways. Just the energetic \\"The Burning Times\\" is worth the price of the entire album! Production-wise, this is just perfect. The rhythm section is intense and pounding, and the guitar riffs will get you air-guitaring until your wrists will melt.  However, it's a shame there are not too many flashy solos (I do miss Skolnick) and that \\"Hatreds Rise\\" sounded to me so close to Scorpion's \\"The Sails Of Charon\\". But besides those two very minor flaws, this is enjoyable... as hell -- he, he. Crank it up to eleven, bang your head and you'll see... It's just so nice when artists dare to throw you a curveball! Just hit it now out of the field... Great release. ROCK ON, TESTAMENT!!!

1591841666|4.0|I'm not normally one for books of this nature: short, quirky books that have easy to understand steps to great success all wrapped in cute little analogies.

Otherwise you might as well quit.  Buy it, read it, and revisit it every year when you need a boost to your career or hobby.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Great expectations are bred by great success and great history. This album must stand as equal testament to the sheer cajones of Trujillo as it does to the fortitude of the other three. Metallica reforged in the fires of hell is of an equal quality to the original. Blasphemy though it may be, Trujillo's contribution to Suicide and Redemption is quite shockingly in the same class as Cliff's best. Metallica is not just resurrected, this album speaks of a second wave of world wide metal domination. Whiplash.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I've seen a lot of people throw around the phrase \\"a lot like Buffy and [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel]]\\" or \\"the best show since [[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy]] and Angel\\" or things of that nature.  Thing is, most of those shows aren't.  None of them are like Angel, and the only one I've seen so far to match Buffy is [[ASIN:B000SULWJA Veronica Mars]].  Well, get ready Angel fans, because the show has finally got something that's come close to a worth successor.  Now in its third season, Eric Kripke's [[ASIN:B000RGX0LI Supernatural]] continues to show that it has mastered the balance of horror, humor, mythology, and drama that Angel was known for.  But enough with the comparisons.  \\"Supernatural\\" is a great show on its own, and this season is proof of that.<br /><br />The writer's strike left a lot of shows with less than stellar material, but not this show.  Each episode, even the less impressive ones, entertain to the fullest.  While the overall arc and even the episode-by-episode quality isn't as great as the fantastic second season, it remains a quality show packed with emotional highs, lows, and \\"Holy ----, I can't believe they just did that!\\" moments.  This season sets out to tie the previous seasons up nicely, giving deserving ends to many of the old arcs.  The Gordon storylin gets paid off, as does the \\"Sam/Dean are wanted men\\" arc.  The main story of the season, however, springs from the deal that Dean made in the finale of [[ASIN:B000R7GKQE the second season]].<br /><br />Dean, to bring Sam back from the death, made a deal that his soul will be taken to Hell in one year's time.  The bulk of the season, though it maintains a somewhat episodic feel, deals with that situation, throwing the two brothers into a fight against the one force they can't conquer again: Death.  Dean's impending death adds such a poignancy to the season, particularly the episodes stretching from the Christmas special to the finale, that even his possible resurrection in Season Four (it has to happen, people) wouldn't take away from the emotional resonance of this arc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a slight step down from the fantastic Season Two, but still a great season of a great show.  Definitely one of the best shows on TV.<br /><br />8/10
B00007KWHP|5.0|This was the first Yes album I bought when I was in High School and it was new. The sound is as good as the original album. I really don't care for the extra songs, but they don't detract from the rest of the album in any way, so I'm ok with it. Get this one if you liked Yes.

0143039601|3.0|I didn't get much out of it. It was a nice diversion from everyday life but I kept looking for the point Kerouac was trying to make and it escaped me. I've been reading a lot of hiker, mostly Appalachian Trail, narratives and thought this would be a nice expansion of the group. I went in with little knowledge and no preconceptions about Kerouac and came away with little appreciation of his work. I'm still going to read On The Road and might revisit this review if the mood strikes me. I suppose the lack of structure is a product of his writing style but I was disappointed in how the story just ended. Again, maybe I was looking for more than he was prepared to reveal. Maybe I'm just too set in my ways. Maybe I did get the point and just don't realize it.

I cant wait for Horizons to come out. Hurry up guys!!!!<br />I gave it four stars because of the crappy vocals on the song A Natural  Disaster. The vocals are just horrible-the music itself is wonderful but the vocals....umm. Just my opioion.<br />That and the album is way to short. I wish it had 15 or 16 songs instead of the ten.<br />This album is a must have for anyone who likes good music.

B00008L3U1|2.0|One gloomy night in August, Brain Powell and Karen Powell (Brain Kerwin and Diane Lane) decided they would like to be parents.  Two months later at a Halloween party Karen realized that the baby was ready to get out after only two months.  Had the baby ripped out Aliens-style, this movie would have no doubt been better; however, it wasn't meant to be.  Nonetheless, the Halloween-spawn came forth as Karen delivered what essentially turned out to be the Wolfman.<br /><br />It turns out that Karen delivered her baby, Jack (Robin Williams), seven months early because he's aging at four-times the rate of a normal human.  What was left out of the explanation, however, was that along with the quadrupled growth rate, Jack had hair growth at roughly 25 times the normal rate.  That's the only explanation for Jack ending up looking like a 40 year old wearing a fur coat or an extra for Planet of the Apes.  Given Williams' resemblance to the guy one step from the right on the evolutionary chart, I suppose the premise is not all that unbelievable.  Williams playing an innocent, character who diddles and fidgets like a child, on the other hand, is just awkward.<br /><br />Anyway, by the time Jack is ready for school he looks like a middle-aged adult.  He eventually ends up going to public school where he's horribly out of place, and it's much worse than you would expect for a movie in which Robin Williams plays a grade-schooler.  In all the appropriate places, where a child interacts with parents, a heartwarming pause is felt by all.  Except anyone with a pulse.  Essentially he's the proverbial turd in a punchbowl.  It's just Robin Williams hamming it up for the camera for 2 hours, basically the same thing he did in the \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\\" video - a grown man willing to flush his dignity down the toilet in order to do ridiculous things that only he finds amusing.<br /><br />Thank goodness for the combined efforts of the talented and gorgeous Diane Lane, and the sexy, nubile school teacher played by Jennifer Lopez.  If not for those two, this atrocity of a movie may have caused riots.  I only recommend this movie for severely deranged masochists.ennifer Lopez.

B0002Y4TOM|4.0|I ordered this for my daughter to receive as a surprise in her mailbox at college and she received it quickly. Her advice is that you not watch the last episode of the season though until you order the next season's set because the cliffhangers are torture!
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I'm not going to say anything about the movie except that it is a fun movie with a good story and my wife thought Will Smith was at his physical best in this movie.  I will say that I bought this movie because I read several reviews on home-theater sites that rated this movie 98 out ot 100 for video quality, which is what I wanted in a Blu-Ray disc.  \\"I, Robot\\" did not fail to live up to my expectations.  This movie was visually stunning.  Great audio too.  The audio during action scenes was properly mixed, with good tight bass and crisp sound effects.  If you want to watch a reference quality Blu-Ray movie, then buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.

0375826726|5.0|I thought this was the best book in the series by far. Character development was great, and i finished it feeling sad, but satisfied, content, and with great anticipation for the 4th book in the series.  In books and movies, I always enjoy the parts the most when the hero is developing. When he is becoming more powerful, learning new moves, and developing as a character.  This series, and Brisinger it self were great at this. It also answered many questions, and created some more.  I highly recommend this book.

015206396X|5.0|I was heartbroken when I turned the last page of GRACELING - because I never wanted it to end, and I'll never be able to read it for the first time again.  The reading experience was just that wonderful.<br /><br />Cashore's writing is charged like a live wire, utterly vital and immediate.  Katsa is like a cross between a lioness and The Tin Man, a beautiful, savage creature in search of a heart... that she finally discovers has always been exactly where it belongs, ticking away peacefully inside her chest.  In order to realize this Katsa must defy the king who has tried to shape her into a mindless weapon, say goodbye to her home and her family, and defeat the only man whose Grace is powerful enough to cancel out her own extraordinary abilities.  Perhaps most difficult of all, Katsa falls in love with the charming, brilliant Prince Po - who has a few secrets of his own.<br /><br />Every character in GRACELING arrives on the page fully formed like Athena - vivid, real, and engaging.  The plot is a great adventure story, full of twists and turns, moving, intelligent, and thrilling.<br /><br />I'd recommend GRACELING to young adults, but also to adults who enjoy children's literature (I fall into the latter category myself).  If you've enjoyed Megan Whelan Turner's THIEF trilogy, Lian Hearn's TALES OF THE OTORI series, Robin McKinley's books, Melissa Marr's fairy tales or Lisa McMann's WAKE, you would do well to buy GRACELING immediately and hang up a Do Not Disturb sign before you crack the first page.

B000OVLBFS|4.0|I really liked this prequel in the series with its flawed yet philosophical protagonist, and its gritty but amiable tone.  Tom Selleck is perfect in the role.  His motivations and fish out of water circumstances are set up nicely, and I truly want to know how he will do in this new environment.  Will he continue down the road to isolation and alcoholism?  Or will he find new life in this small community?  The crimes are interesting, too, but it's the characterization and relationship issues that make this special.

0670020745|4.0|Very enjoyable and educational read. This sure takes the mystery out of the mysterious \\"sudden enlightenment\\" stories we often hear about.    I learned so much about myself from this book. The author's story is amazing, her knowledge is fascinating, and her ability to put her experience together with her education, and weave this tale of recovery and insight for us... is astounding.    Thank you, Jill Bolte Taylor!
B0013UIUBC|1.0|The original - Bella Martha - is a very tasteful (not superior but touching) German movie with actual people, somewhat melancholic but still a comedy (the soft, melancholic humor suits the story so much better than slapstick humor). Don't watch this, get the original. When comparing these two versions of the same story (in every detail), you can see a vast difference which, for me, lies mostly in the \\"reality\\" of the movie. In \\"Bella Martha\\" I \\"buy\\" it, the characters, the plot, the setting. In \\"No Reservations\\" it's all fake and funny, funny, funny.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been reading many reviews saying that the sound of the Death Magnetic CD is terrible. My question is: where did you guys buy the CD? From the Flea Market? My husband and I bought the CD from Hot Topic and the sound is perfect. It's perfect in the car, on the stereo, in the computer... everywhere. Many people complain the songs are too long... I love them the way they are. Metallica is back to the roots which is FANTASTIC!! Death Magnetic is one of the best Metallica albums ever! I've been a fan for 18 years and by far, Death Magnetic is the best album of the last 17 years.
B00008PW2D|5.0|The 5th season is the shortest one and it leaves you wanting and wishing there were more episodes. But the ones that are included in season 5 are great. Its the season where Charlotte and Harry meet and Berger and Carrie try to start a romance. I hate how this season has so few episodes but still costs the same as the other seasons that have 3 times as many episodes.
0061537934|5.0|I must say this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I picked this book up after seeing it featured at Starbucks, and absolutely loved it.  It is very different from any other book about a dog I've ever read.  Using the dog as the narrator made this very enjoyable.  I recommend for all animal lovers everywhere.
B00004RFCM|4.0|By far the weirdest season of SATC, but still good. It isn't at all what you find in season 6 but the essence of all the girls is there. The first season is more about Carrie doing research for her column by interviewing people and talking straight to the camera. The series definitely gets much better with passing seasons.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|It took me nearly a week to get this cd because of how terrible St. Anger was. I picked it up on my way home from an event and tossed it in the cd player.From the opening of That Was Just Your Life through the end of My Apocalypse I was transported back to what should have been the follow up to ... And Justice For All. I had heard how they were looking to go back to the \\"classic\\" sound, but they said that on St Anger. They achieve it here in grand form. Some of the stand out tracks are The Judas Kiss, Cyanide, and very surprisingly The Unforgiven III. The Day That Never Comes sounds very similar to One. I can't stop listening to this cd. Look I know it can never be Ride The Lightning or Master of Puppets, it still can be considered a very good album and any fan of the \\"classic\\" sound of the band should give this a listen. It is the best album since the Black Album.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I really loved this movie and any fan of the series will love it too. It was a prefect movie to do after the series went off 4 years ago. If you didn't like the series or never watched it, you probably won't like this movie. But fans of the SATC, this movie will be just what you asked for!
B000002H70|4.0|Epic goth-pop with sumptuous production at times recalls label 4AD's pioneering sounds but with The Cure the sound is completely fleshed out for an accessibly dark enjoyment. Although the pacing and sometimes stark minimalist instrumentation veer towards plodding, the band had a knack for letting these confined compositions stretch out and breathe on this very solid, often considered quintessential, release.
B000026OHN|1.0|The quality of the recording is very bad indeed. Above all there is a terrible resonance effect, and also the timbre is awful. But it isn't only this. There is something else for me, very important. It seems to me that the piano sustaining pedal is used very much, almost always. When Richter take away fingers and feet, the sound \\"aura\\" that remains is by far much less, and not only at the end of the peice, where could came into the work of sound engineer. That's also typical of the romantic school that Richter represent... And that, playng Bach, would be really unbearable! On the other hand, otherwise, he would had never approved this recording for issuing. The recording I'm talking about is the Salzburg 1970 one of the first book of the work (that I bought fotunately low price with a classic music magazine) and I'm sure enough is the same of this cd set.    Post Scriptum: And the torn, destroyed and burned score on the cover what is it? A freudian slip (lapsus), a provocation (they are \\"screwing around\\" us) or what?    If you don't like Glenn Gould Bach, listen Martha Argerich Bach (Toccata BWV 911, Patita BWV 826, Englishe suite No.2 BWV 807, last two in particular) or Dinu Lipatti (partita No.1)... And learn.    Ah... RICHTER SAID HIMSELF in an interview that the best Well tempered clavier is the Glenn Gould one.

055358894X|4.0|All told, I'd probably rate this book as a 3.5. Seeing as I can't, I suppose I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.    A caveat-- many reviewers here are reacting to whether this book did or didn't live up to the \\"hype\\" it apparently enjoyed upon release.  Seeing as I came across this book at random, and wasn't under the impression that this WAS \\"hyped,\\" I didn't have any expectations going in.    I have to admit that the first third of the book was kind of rough going-- I wasn't really hooked into the characters or the world Lynch was building, and the flashbacks WERE much more interesting than the story set in the present.  Once the plot started moving, though, it really hooked me. There's a lot going on here, including con games, double crosses, organized crime, secret police, deadly magic, villains you love to hate, heroes to (ultimately) root for, and a thankfully satisfying conclusion.    Lots of people seem upset by the levels of profanity in the book, and while it took some getting used to, it didn't bother me in the least. Was it \\"necessary\\"? Is it ever? The book COULD have been written without it, but it works just fine as a stylistic choice.     In the end, this book made me want to read the sequel. Can't ask for more than that.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I don't like writing long reviews or doing song-by-song breakdowns, so i'll keep this short and to the point.  Metallica's new album 'Death Magnetic' is a very good comeback after the disaster that was 'St. Anger'. The album has a pre Black album feel to it, good songs include: That was just your life, The day that never comes and Cyanide.   Everything about this albums indicates a return to the old school days, from little things like the album art (band logo) to a 10 track set to the length of the songs and guitar solos by Kirk.     I would recommend buying this album if you're a fan of the old school Metallica. I did own St. Anger but upon hearing this album, 'Death Magnetic is SO much more worthy of a space on my CD shelf. In conclusion this is a return to form for the band, not as good as some of their other albums (master of puppets, kill em' all, ...and justice for all or ride the lightning) but is better than some of their newer albums (load, reload and St. Anger). A good buy.
0316143472|4.0|I liked this book. It was funny & clever, especially the author's struggle to quit smoking. I suggest you also buy the author's best work, \\"Naked\\".
B000066HI4|3.0|I listened to \\"I See A Darkness\\" four times before I decided to review it. As a fan of Dan Reeder, I have a fondness for \\"American Primitive\\" which I believe this album is. However, I found this album to be murky for murky's sake, an aural emperor daring you to say it has no clothes. This was my first exposure to the Bonnie Prince, so perhaps other albums are less \\"primitive emo\\" as I've come to call this. And maybe he sells it better live, as I'm going to see him at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in SF this year.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Wonderful strategy game for all ages.  It's the one game we all agree on when deciding what to play, from my 7 yr. old son to my 70 yr. old dad.  And when there isn't anyone to play with, my son enjoys making pictures with the pieces.
B001G52F2E|5.0|When season 3 of this show ended, Dean had been ripped apart by the hounds of hell and his spirit/soul was ensnared in some techno-web where he bled and screamed for his brother.<br /><br />When we begin THIS season, he's been dead four months. There's no preamble here--he just comes back, immediately. It's not clear how or why; it's only clear that something pretty powerful brought him back (and decimated the landscape around him in the process).<br /><br />This episode is VERY nicely put together, from the reunion scenes with Bobby and Sam to the end scene where Dean finds out precisely who brought him back (and wow, what a cutie his savior is!) and why, all the emotional pieces come together beautifully but not melodramatically, and there's humor and suspense throughout.<br /><br />The coming season is set up, and there's enough in this one episode to tell us that season four will have more than the usual share of conflict between the brothers and between Dean and his fatalism.<br /><br />Bravo!
0618154248|5.0|This book set is great for my 15 month old to carry around. We read a book, put it back and he loves to carry it around, with the other set of Curious George board books we got him. He feels like a big boy when he brings his box of books to us.
0312379293|5.0|I started reading Jeffrey Archer's novels when I was in college. I loved them so much that I bought and read all his works at least twice over the next 10 years.<br />While some of his novels/ short stories may seem a bit of a stretch, I have always found his story telling to be very tight, with an elegant use of English and brilliant one-liners, full of suspense and at several times an edge of the seat turn of events when you cannot take your eyes of the book to even go for a drink of water. The character development was always so nicely done that I could see the story play in my mind as I read the novels.<br /><br />Then after his prison term, came \\"Sons of Fortune\\" and I was not at all impressed with that book (the court drama in that is like a school kids effort compared to the one in \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\"). Post that came, \\"False Impression\\" and I was disappointed to say the least. These two books took away the complete character of Jeffrey Archers story telling. They read like a below average effort by someone using his name.<br /><br />When \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" was released, I was determined not to buy the hard bound book and waited for the paper back before I purchased and read it.<br /><br />And I am delighted to say that the real Jeffrey Archer is back. And with a bang. This was nothing short of a brilliant novel with very neat story telling, brilliant characters and as always, edge of the seat drama and turn of events. Parts of prison escape might seem predictable, but were very well written. The trip made to a Swiss bank, anxiety of how the hero's return would be handled and how the illegality of the will was established are but a few of the brilliantly written parts. Ending, as always was very nice but left me wanting for more...<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it whole heartedly. Now I wait for the next book from Jeffrey Archer and this time I will buy the hard bound, as soon as it is released.<br /><br />Would I call it Archer's best? No. That would probably be between \\"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less'', \\"Kane and Abel\\" and maybe some of his short stories. However, it would definitely rank among one of his best.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|A hit film from the director of later box-office hit \\"Basic Instinct,\\" the action movie \\"Robocop\\" is a classic. While I enjoyed the movie, I've gotta say that I've a small grievance. I played the Nintendo Game based on the film when I was a kid (and the music from the game sounded a bit like the main theme from the movie; I saw the film for the first time ever yeterday). Was a video game really neccessary to market this violent movie to kids? Could've been a Disney movie without all the graphic violence and strong language (hence the reason for my giving it 4 stars instead of 5).<br /><br />If a remake is neccessary, PLEASE MAKE IT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE, REMOVING THE GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND STRONG LANGUAGE. Then, action figures & video games would be acceptable to market this movie to children.<br /><br />Rated R for graphic violence and strong language.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Mamma Mia -- the movie was great fun and the soundtrack will keep you singing along with a host of ABBA classics.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Woefully underrated and misunderstood by many, but a film for folks of all ages who have the background to get it.  Works as both an apotheosis of the original and as a story where \\"it's what's under the hood that counts\\".  Chris Pandolfi's detailed featured review is spot-on.  As per the movie's closing koan: \\"Go Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer - Go!\\"
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is way better than St. Anger. I agree with some reviews not  much composition,  but it's thrash metal. This is definitely an album for old Metallica fans. Rick Rubin had them go back to their roots as you can tell on \\"Judas Kiss\\" and others.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Yes....Metallica is back and better than ever!!! Buy this new release for it will go down as one of their greatest musical compositions they have created in their heavy metal career.  Can't wait to see them perform live again...long live Metallica!!!
B001AD3NIM|3.0|It seems Alanis is no stranger to the \\"Seven Spins\\" curse - the fact that some records need to be played seven full times through before they start sounding indispensable to your life. Vanessa Paradis' 1992 English album, and Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Downward Spiral\\" are two of these kinds of albums, for me, and Alanis' 2008 release certainly falls into this category.<br /><br />For all the hype about its' \\"sonic elements\\" and \\"electronica tinged tunes\\", the album is pretty much a straightforward pop record with none of the guitar-soaked melodies that either \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" or \\"SFIJ\\" had. This is both a good and a bad thing. Every Alanis album of late has had some bonafide classics on it - for example \\"So Called Chaos\\" had the wonderful \\"Excuses\\" (a masterpiece) and \\"Under Rug Swept\\" had \\"Flinch\\" (another certifiable classic). \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\", even upon repeat play, has no 'one song' that stands out. Its a mish-mash of things, some songs are embarrassingly generic, but its very much a long-play record, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, where you put the record on and let it do its thing in the background. If this sort of thing is what youre after, then the album will work for you.<br /><br />However, pitted against her back-catalog, the new album falters. Its ironic that the second CD of this 2-CD set is almost twice as good as the entire first CD (even more ironic that it only contains half the number of tracks that the first CD has). Despite that, the album should please longtime Alanis fans, only because some songs (\\"Moratorium\\", \\"Not As We\\", \\"Straitjacket\\") are 'different', and deal with subject matter familiar to Alanis-territory (ending of a relationship, excess baggage, self-worth).<br /><br />The one thing that really frustrates though, is Alanis' lack of maturity in her songwriting. This is especially evident when you read the really mundane songwriting on tracks such as \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\". Everything here has been done before (by Alanis herself, no less), and it doesn't look like getting out of a relationship has enriched her life or outlook much. If anything, she seems like a more disinterested version of her former self - which of course is something that totally does not work for you if you've been following her work for a while.<br /><br />\\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is not a masterpiece, but once you get accustomed to it playing, you find yourself singing along, or remembering a tune there, a melody here, stuff like that. Its now a solid part of Alanis' catalog, to be sure but ironically not because the music is that good. It helps for you to invest in the album (on that level, this record is very much like \\"So Called Chaos\\", which remains infinitely superior to this one) and you might find yourself warming to it a bit more. Many people I've played this for though have found that even supposedly 'touching' songs such as \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Torch\\" come off as fake and forced - and this is the first time I've come across such feedback for an Alanis album.<br /><br />Bottom line - this is not for everyone, and if you're a seasoned Alanis fan, it might worry you that her maturity hasn't quite kept pace with your own growth in life. Thats sad, but then again, shes only human. If youre looking for true introspective lyrics, look no further than \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\". If youre looking for \\"light\\" stuff that sounds like Alanis but isn't quite up to her own lofty standards, then this is the album for you.<br /><br />And do get the 2-CD Edition. The 11 Track Single-Disc Edition is virtually useless.o less), and it doesn't look like getting out of a relationship has enriched her life or outlook much.

0393330435|4.0|I was looking to find out how much was true of Pirates of Silicon Valley when I came across this book. I'm not a fan of Apple, but I am a person who enjoys history of many sorts, and I am close to getting a degree in Engineering Technology.  It's just a great read. There are many interesting things in here about history, such as his thoughts on Vietnam. He talks about his design decisions in simple terms. He describes in detail the most hilarious pranks that had me laughing aloud. I even learned a few things that might help me as an engineer. If I wasn't so busy, this book would be done in 2-3 days tops. It's just that difficult to put down. I always want to know what happens next and am disappointed when I have to put it down.  There are a few minor downsides. He is often repeats himself. He can be pompous at times. Some sentences don't communicate well. Even after reading the sentences multiple times, I couldn't understand what it was saying.  I'm just over halfway done with the book and I had to write the review because I am so excited about this book. I don't think you have to know any technical knowledge to enjoy it for what it is.  Update:  I finished the book. My opinion is unchanged. It rocked!
B001AZIRZY|3.0|I love NPR Radio's Car Talk with the Tappet Brothers . Now saying that, I say this cartoon is nothing like the Car Talk show..so those looking for the car talk humor that you hear on NPR, IT aint here!<br /><br />I saw all these cartoons on my local PBS station. The same stuff as you will get on this 2 disk DVD package<br /><br />First the bad news...Tom and Ray Magliozzi seem to dumb down their radio personas and  tried to milk their Click and Clack characters in this cartoon. The pilots are paper thin. The animation is drawn so badly, you wonder if the animators drew their characters out of the line purposely.<br /><br />Now the good news...It is cute cartoon for kids. To have good family entertain is a rare thing and should be patted on the head. It has a sugar sweetness that adults can enjoy with the kids. Some of the lines are pure groiner for adults but kids will laugh at the Tappets wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Will Tom and Ray be the next cartoon superstars? I truly doubt it. But they can try! I will still listen to both of you on Car Talk for my laughs!<br /><br />it is great to get for family viewing..so buy it for the kids and watch it with them!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD

031606792X|1.0|So, I loved the first three books and was really excited to read this one and finally experiencing the things we've been waiting for, like Edward and Bella getting married, Bella becoming a vampire, some sort of resolution with the vampires and the werewolves, and, of course, the impending confrontation with the Volturi.     I have not been this disappointed in a book in a LONG time.  There were no real conflicts in the entire book.  Every time something started to come up, there was a magic cure for it.  The characters all started running together and the author revealed herself way too much.  I really feel that this book was just her living out some Cinderella fantasy (except I liked Cinderella better).  I think she started out with some promising ideas, but this book was like eating sugar strait from the jar.  I wanted things to end up happily, sure, but she got everything she ever wanted.  And I agree with the last review, her entire life was about Edward and Jacob, without them, she didn't even really exist and all her self esteem issues got to be magically resolved.  I get that fantasy isn't really meant to be realistic, but it should be believable for what it is.  I think she may have ruined a promising career with this book.  Don't waste your time. Read the other three books, explain them to a 5 year old girl and ask her to tell you how the story ends.  It will be much more interesting, I promise.
0060512806|5.0|Did you ever feel like someone listened to all your thoughts, figured out exactly what your interests are, then wrote novels specifically directed at you?  I love everything that this guy writes.  Partly because he writes well, but also partly because he thinks deeply on topics that interest me: modern currencies (which are basically confidence games), future implications of nanotechnology, the role of cryptology in the movement of money, how governments will be affected by the fact that geographical location is becoming less relevant, the complex and subtle differences between cultures and the evolution of manufacturing.  Gotta go.... buy my next Neal Stephenson novel.
B0017VG69U|4.0|This was for my husband who is a fan, but like the TOS First Season set, the remastering is really nice with added effects and the clean up of the original is so good you can see seam lines on the actor's clothes and the colors are vibrant and accurate to when originally aired.  This comes from a reliable source-my husband who is not only a professional costumer, but worked on Next Gen, and has been asked over the years to authenticate quite a few original costumes from the TOS era. The only complaint I have is against Toshiba for pulling out of the HD system manufacturing so quickly.  We were both really looking forward to seeing the TOS Second Season in that format as the First Season looks SO good. Oh well.
0374531269|5.0|Fair warning, this story will make you shiver.  Emerging from the pages like an inverted Mark Twain novel, it reveals the tale of a young boy named Ishmael Beah and his horrific journey through early adolescence in war ravaged Sierra Leone in the 1990s. It's not the high octane carnage, sadistic ingenuity, or pervasive sense of evil that render this book more terrifying than a Stephen King/Dean Koontz collaboration.  It's the fact that it's real, the candid recollections of an innocent kid caught in the vise of hell and abandoned there.  This, the narrative illustrates with chilling authenticity, is how demons are made.      Beah's transformation from a hip hop loving twelve year old with low slung pants into brutal, bloodthirsty automaton takes place in stages, after his village is attacked and brutalized by rebel forces battling Sierra's Leone's military government.  Stripped of his family, his possessions, and through hunger, terror, and exhaustion, of all hope for escape, Beah strips himself down to an essential survivalist core.  In the process, the most basic empathies that define a human being peel away, and the stark dictum of kill or be killed becomes the only rule that matters.    Co opted by the guerilla forces ravaging the countryside, Beah and his young friends become soldiers, outdoing each other in acts of violence the way most twelve year olds compete at baseball.  Fueled by drugs and the adrenaline of survival, they bond with their overseers with the fervor of a championship high school football team.  Their banter with each other becomes ever more obscene, still peppered as it is with the playful ripostes of youthful rivalry.  But though the narrative style of simple declarative sentences and innocent exclamations remains consistent throughout, we observe changes in these children that makes us fear them, even at the remove of ink on page.  They become monsters.    Only once removed from the situation by a UN sponsored NGO does the depth of the damage done to these young souls reveal itself in unvarnished form.  Contemptuous of humanity, seriously addicted now to amphetamines and to their commanders' approval, they're dangerous to each other and anyone who comes in contact with them, including their naive rescuers.  Months pass before even the most rudimentary chinks can be observed in their armor of callous cruelty.  In time, change happens.  But we have no way of knowing how deep the scars will go.      One of the most frightening aspects of this book, aside from its unflinching authenticity, is that fact that there are no good guys.  The conflicts destroying Sierra Leone are like a jumbled chess set of all one color, with no sense at all of who carries the banner of morality, or even simple humanity.  One hopes that Ishmael Beah has banished the last of his nightmares with the publication of his book.  But it's more likely that he's just passed them all along to us, and that the monsters live on.
B001E780W8|5.0|First of all, I liked the whole album. A little different from their other releases, but solid. I loved the pacing of the entire album. from heavy one song to mellow another and back to something in-between. My favorite track has to be Vendetta. Awesome! and Snuff too!
B0007PAMR4|1.0|Basically this movie is a 2 1/2 hour snooze fest which has an action scene to get you excited for what is perceived to be more entertainment, only to abruptly end. The movie is very dense, and doesn't reiterate any important events that are given in dense chunks of information. Instead what the movie does is offer many reminders to unimportant events, often several times per event. Such as Jessica sees her son Paul is alive. She is excited he is alive, then she thinks \\"Paul is alive.\\" And then later on she will say once more that she is glad her son is alive. We as the viewers readily see that Paul is alive, and yet we are treated to several reminders, just incase we didn't pick up on it the first three times. Whereas complex political relationships aren't expanded upon, or re-explained, they are briefly described and then you are left in a cloud of confusion. Another complaint would be the constant thoughts of the characters you are treated to, such as Jessica thinking \\"my son is alive\\" these events occur often, and add nothing to the movie, they serve to break up the flow of the film. Paul has one such thought episode, which is useful (the only one in the entire film) which he describes an on screen item, and explains its function as well as his actions regarding it, giving us viewers a real treat, relevant information. The special effects were cheesy in some parts, such as sound guns which we only sometime see projectile being ejected from and the Fremen's blue within blue eyes that only show up half of the time they are on screen.    This movie could have been a good movie if they cut the film to half of its length and removed the several reiterations of events occurring only seconds before. The movie ends up being all a set up for the final confrontation between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, which itself seems rushed due to the great length of the film. The film should have spent less time setting up the story and more time dealing with the actual story.
B00004RYC7|4.0|Arnie is a spy, Jamie Lee Curtis is a housewife. Inside the lies of their marriage are a great many fine stunts and setpieces, with some superb one liners and a lot of first class action.<br />This is a very entertaining and enjoyable film, like James Bond but with less class.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
B0013FDM7E|2.0|The special effects in this movie is top notch. The acting is pretty good as well and the story telling is pretty darn good as well. Why didn't I like this movie then? It just wasn't very fun. There wasn't a lot of human interaction.... it was basically a Will Smith monologue and while he did a good job listening to Will Smith talk to himself for over an hour gets old real quick. The zoombies or living dead special effects wise were top knotch but they were a little creapy (which is probably what they were going for).     Strangly enough everything in this movie was done well except the fun factor. This is kind of a depressing movie and nothing really good happens until the end (kind of like Will Smith's the Pursuit of Happiness) and by the time that happens it just isn't enough.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The violence and cinematography in this film are first class.

6305313687|4.0|I love this movie.  My only criticism is the excessive language.  If It wasn't for that, this movie could be used by parents and educators to teach a new generation about racism and how one influential man was able to make a complete turn around.  The main character (Derek) learned how to see past the color of someone's skin and came home to help his family discover the same. The movie has a very sad ending, but unfortunately an all to common reality.

0375826726|2.0|Paolini spends too much time explaining background through drawn-out dialogs rather than presenting the information in a way that allows the reader to connect the dots on their own.  This book could have been half as long and twice as good.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I rented this movie thinking that it was going to be spooky and suspenseful, considering how little they led on about the movie, I thought it was going to make it that much better. Well, just to rent the movie cost me less than a dollar, but I still want a REFUND!  This is the only movie I'd say don't waste your time with. Don't even rent it. 2nd worst movie I've seen in my entire life.
0061478784|5.0|Sophie is the first-born daughter of a deceased hatter.  She makes hats in the shop, now run by her step-mother, resigned to her fate of being a homebody when the Witch of the Waste, for reasons of her own which she is not sharing, changes Sophie into an old woman.  Fearing rejection Sophie makes her way out into the wide world and finds herself housekeeper to the dread wizard Howl.  As you might guess adventures and self-discovery abound in this enchanting book for young readers, and not so young readers like me.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones has managed to weave a wonderful new fairy tale with everything the old fairytales have that make them so timeless and wonderful!  The prose is beautiful and very intelligent, but simple enough that readers as young as third or fourth grade can easily follow it.  There is nothing predictable about this tale and you will find yourself turning the pages quickly wanting immerse yourself deeper in this world where wizards and witches are business people and the distance between the mundane and the miraculous is as close as the nose on your face.

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|What if an average guy from Ann Arbor, Michigan discovers at age 15 that he has the ability to travel instantaneously to other locations?  How would he handle that ability?  Those questions are answered in \\"Jumper,\\" directed by Doug Liman.<br /><br />\\"Jumper\\" is based on an intriguing premise:  a person has the ability to teleport himself at will to anywhere in the world, whether it be just a few feet away in his apartment or thousands of miles across the globe.  Sounds like a quality belonging to a spandex-clad superhero more than an average Joe.  After all, Superman essentially has that ability because of his super-speed, and Superman dates back to 1938.<br /><br />David Rice (Hayden Christensen) realizes he has this \\"jumping\\" ability when he almost drowns.  In a split second, he finds himself in the midst of bookshelves in the Ann Arbor Public Library along with enough water to destroy a third of the library's book collection.<br /><br />With a cartoonishly mean father (Michael Rooker) and more than his share of teen angst, David decides to make for the big city, his teleportation talent the road to a whole new life.  But this invisible zipping from space to place doesn't come easily, as David practices teleportation in Central Park, slamming into trees while learning to fine tune his ability.<br /><br />The beginning of \\"Jumper\\" is very intriguing, and the film promises an enjoyable ride.  But so much goes wrong along the way, the movie crumbles before our eyes.  Let's take the character of David.  Though he's not a traditional superhero, we've become conditioned to expect that a lad lucky enough to have unusual strengths will use them for good.  What does David do?  He breaks into bank vaults, steals huge sums of money, sets himself up in luxury apartments all over the world, picnics atop the Sphinx, surfboards in Fiji, hangs out, literally, from Big Ben in London, and picks up girls all over the world.  He's not exactly bettering mankind or combating evil.<br/><br />The element of conflict that drives the film comes in the character of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), a Paladin.  The Paladins are Jumper hunters.  Why?  Roland makes a brief comment that only God should have the right to be omnipresent.  Huh?  Is that it?  Yep.  For half the movie, David jumps from place to place to stay ahead of the Paladins, who want to capture him because of pseudo-religious self-righteousness.<br /><br />Christensen is a likable actor and he succeeds in making us care about his David, even though the character is a shallow, pretty-boy hedonist.  I suppose the good will he engendered as young Anakin Skywalker has spilled over to this less interesting character.<br /><br />Jackson mails in this performance.  His appearance with snow-white hair is a lot of fun, though his character is humorless.  We've seen the same from this actor before:  intense close-ups, slow, threatening delivery of dialogue, and attitude a mile wide.  His Paladin is a warrior, which allows for action and violence.  But wouldn't it be interesting if Jackson played the role more low-key, using psychological terror rather than physical force?<br /><br />The film shines when we're introduced to Griffin (Jamie Bell, \\"Billy Elliot\\"), a fellow Jumper David meets in Rome's Coliseum.  Griffin serves as the expositional mouthpiece of the film, informing David (and the audience) that David isn't the only Jumper in the world and providing back story about the Paladins' ongoing persecution of Jumpers.  Bell has enormous energy and a streetwise toughness that contrasts sharply with Cristensen's laid-back style.  Whenever Bell is on screen, he commands it.<br /><br />The dutiful love interest of sorts is provided by the lovely Anna-Sophia Robb as Millie, an adolescent crush from David's hometown, whom he looks up years later and invites to accompany him to Rome.  What happened to \\"Want to have a cup of coffee?\\"  As written, the role of Millie is meant to be serviceable eye candy, andMillie is swept up in the usual machinations of \\"things beyond her control,\\" becoming more involved in the plot than she should be.<br /><br />A trilogy of writers are responsible for the final screenplay of \\"Jumpers,\\" which looks as if huge chunks are missing.  Things move too swiftly, even for a movie about a guy who can scoot from city to city in a millisecond.  Viewers are entitled to enough time to get to know the characters so that they care about what happens to them.  A quick dissolve, for instance, shows David going from 15 to 20-something, still living in the same dumpy hotel he came to years before.  Why is he still there when the cash he's stolen can surely allow him to afford better digs?  And why are the teleportation scenes so inconsistent?  Sometimes David whisks to another location with just a rush of air and a swooshing sound.  Other times, there is serious damage to concrete and floor tiles.<br /><br />The locations are interesting, but seem to be there more as scenic backdrops to the story than as integral parts of it.  With the exception of the Rome sequence, those taking place in Cairo, Tokyo, Prague, and Mexico are intended to be impressive to audiences that have seen all these places many times over on screen.  They no longer carry the same impact.<br /><br />Rated PG-13, \\"Jumper\\" uses an interesting premise, but takes all the wrong turns as it unfolds its tale, offering a movie experience long on special effects, short on meaty story and gripping characters.
B0010X745K|3.0|That's the question you have to ask yourself before watching this movie, especially if you've read the short story.<br /><br />The movie, for the most part, is pretty good. I like the fact it deleted the part where the father has the brief 'encounter' with the woman in the store. (I can see it now \\"Yes, honey, I was grieving so much over losing you I immediately gave my kid to someone while I boinked a stranger.\\" Pul-ease!) Thomas Jane was a good choice for the lead and Marcia Gay Harden is simply incredible as the fanatic.<br /><br />Plot: After a severe storm, a gov't research facility has an accident which possibly has openned up a doorway to another demension. \\"Things\\" come pouring through across the lake and into a small town. When a man comes running out of the mist into a grocery store, battered and bloody, everyone realizes something out of the ordinary is going on.<br /><br />The monsters are ok, nothing extraordinary. The acting is top-notch. As others have mentioned here, the problem is the ending. MAJOR PLOT SPOILER - IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT GO ON!  I simply cannot see anyone in that kind of desperate situation not waiting until the very last second before killing everyone, including his own child. It is human nature to put off the unpleasant, and it doesn't get much more unpleasant than that. Even though it is done to prevent something horrible from getting them all, still...  No, this ending was done strictly for shock value and no other reason. Shame on whoever made that decision.<br /><br />If you don't mind a decent movie with one of the worst endings I've seen in years, go for it. Otherwise, read the short story and gripe at King about his \\"no ending at all\\".
B0006GANOQ|5.0|If ever there was a film that doesn't apologize for being \\"Hollywood\\" .....'Speed' has got to be it. This movie delivers action, action and more action to the point of absurdity, but it's a lot of fun. Hopper gives his usual wacko performance once again and Bullock is her usual cute self. Reeves fills in the \\"hero\\" shoes fine, but it's the \\"just one more over the top situation\\" that makes this film too much! Get the largest bowl in your house and fill it till it spills over with popcorn and enjoy.......don't forget to leave your brain at the door!

B001BKG9SK|3.0|In 2007 David Gilmour released \\"Remembering that Night\\" an enjoyable live recording that I've played/watched many times over the past year. It features the music of his most recent studio album plus Pink Floyd favorites. Here we are a year later with a new live recording and the first 15 tracks are identical to the release a year ago. When I saw this new release I'd hoped we might find that Gilmour had added some songs from his first two solo LP's to the mix. Certainly  \\"Short and Sweet\\" \\"There's No Way Out of Here\\" from the first LP and \\"Out of the Blue\\" from the second LP would have been a nice addition to the new material. Given the near identical setlist I can only recommend this to those who don't own \\"Remembering\\" or  are diehard fans. I'll keep my fingers crossed that one of these days David will realize there are many of us who love those first two studio albums and he will reward us with a live disk featuring the best of those records.
B000K6QIQO|5.0|After all was said and done, the folks at Capitol, Apple, EMI and Parlophone released this magnificent album back in the early part of the year 1970. It marked the very first time that all 10 of these songs were officially released onto an American Beatles album. The album's first two tracks, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", which were featured prominently in the movie \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", appeared on that film's soundtrack album issued by United Artists records. Capitol did release the songs as singles in 1964, but they did not appear on a Beatles album until 1970. The next two selections, \\"Paperback Writer\\" and \\"Rain\\", were released together only as a single in 1966, around the same time as the \\"Revolver\\" album. Next up is \\"Lady Madonna\\", which became a huge top five hit single in March 1968. It was also the last Beatles single released on the Capitol label, during the 60s. \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\" were the B-side and A-side, respectively of the first single issued on The Beatles' own Apple label, back in August 1968. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was the B-side to the single \\"Get Back\\", which was first released in May 1969. \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" and \\"The Ballad Of John And Yoko\\" were the B-side and A-side of the single released in June 1969. Of the album's 10 songs, 7 of them had previously not been issued in Stereo in the U.S. before. Although this album only reached its peak position of number two on the Billboard Album Charts, it still went on to become one of the band's all-time best selling LPs. The album would eventually become one of the biggest selling import LPs in Great Britain, before recieving an official U.K. release in that country in 1979. One of the reasons that this album still holds up as well as it has is due to the quality of the songs selected for inclusion. However, at the time of this album's original release, it was not meant to fill in al the gaps of Beatles songs not yet appearing on American Capitol albums. The following songscould have also been programmed as part of the line-up; \\"Misery\\" and \\"There's A Place\\" (although both songs were issued on Parlophone's \\"Please Please Me\\" album and Vee-Jay's \\"Introducing The Beatles\\"). These two songs would have fit in nicely on Capitol's \\"The Early Beatles\\" LP. \\"From Me To You\\" was only a single release in 1963, but did make its official album debut in England on the compilation \\"A Collection Of Beatles Oldies\\" in 1966. \\"Sie Liebt Dich\\", the German-sung variation of \\"She Loves You\\", was previously released as a single on the Swan label. The title song to the Beatles' 1964 film, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", did appear on both the British Parlophone soundtrack album and on the American United Artists soundtrack LP, in 1964. \\"I'm Down\\", which remained only as a single B-side since 1965. \\"The Inner Light\\", the much-overlooked and often-neglected B-side to the \\"Lady Madonna\\" single from 1968. With only 10 songs and a running time of approximately 33 1/3 minutes total, the \\"Beatles Again/Hey Jude\\" album from 1970 could have easily included all of these aforementioned songs. Nonetheless, what you have here is a superb collection of songs nicely situated within an album that deserves a release on compact disc. These songs are currently available on the CDs \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"1962-1966\\", \\"1967-1970\\", \\"Past Masters Volume Two\\" and \\"The Beatles 1\\". But, they rightfully belong together onto an official CD release of the 1970 \\"Hey Jude\\" album. No doubt, this CD would eventually become a huge best-seller for Apple and The Beatles.

0440237688|4.0|I found the book intriquing, perhaps a little rushed towards the end, but intriquing and thoughtful.     A young boy called Jonas reaches his twelfth birthday and is assigned the job to be the community's receiver of memory, the one person in the community who feels and remembers. What he discovers about his life and his home will change him forever.    This book fully explores the idea that for humanity to be at peace, then certain freedoms must be sacrificed. In the community, diversity is not marked upon for fear of upsetting others, people are assigned their partners and children are produced by breeding mothers and adopted by the 'right' family. Pain is unknown and so is hunger, emotions are not experienced and sex is unheard of. When the aged reach a certain age they are 'released' from the community, as are the punier half of twins and babies that do not develop properly.     Lois Lowry has created a world to think about. What if we could all live together happily, politely? Lots of people think we can, but as we are all different could we. Would we have to take those basic of human emotions and suppress them beneath drugs and courtesy? Would we stop hunger by the simple expedient of choosing how many could procreate and who would live once they're done. Would we stop seeing the differences between ourselves by denying them? And is this society unrealistic? I think with the right circumstances, we could be there and that's what makes it frightening.    An excellent book by an excellent author.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Aside from agreeing with much of what has been said (... it's great, recalls vintage Metallica, etc.) I suggest you check out the ENTIRE cut \\"Suicide & Redemption\\".

B001E75QGG|2.0|What an immense disappointment this film was. After 19 years of waiting we deserved something better. I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous installments in the franchise.<br /><br />Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind and who wouldn't be. It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this installment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.<br /><br />The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up [[ASIN:B000VNMMQ6 Live Free or Die Hard [Blu-ray]]] the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.<br /><br />Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.<br /><br />I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas (who has been flogging his one long-dead horse since 1977 for all it's worth) hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the plot doesn't even make sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script than anything else.<br /><br />Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this friggin' ain't [[ASIN:B000QFW7UA The Goonies [Blu-ray]]], man. And despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)]] with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game.<br /><br />When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.<br /><br />Indy IV should never have happened. If the series MUST have been continued then a big-screen Young Indiana Jones adventure would have held so much more potential. The Young Indy series is exactly what you need to watch if you feel let down bythis time-wasting potboiler. Though I did appreciate the Young Indiana Jones reference about half an hour into it. I wonder how many people picked up on that.<br /><br />Spielberg has lost it. Plain and simple.Young Indiana Jones reference about half an hour into it. I wonder how many people picked up on that.    Spielberg has lost it. Plain and simple.

B001FEA9QU|4.0|First let me talk about the quality. It's not THAT bad. I know some of these audiophiles, the ones that can still hear echos of the Big Bang with their naked ears, don't like it, I get it, but for the average person, I don't think it sounds bad. I thought St. Anger was way worse sound quality, but then the music was also alot worse. I'm also not some kind of musician or professional reviewer, I just know what I like, and I like this new album. Do not let these audiophiles scare you away from downloading it. Here's a thought, download one track and check it out. I recommend Suicide and Redemption. It's a long instrumental, and it's really good. Judas Kiss is also good. I've only listened to the album twice so far, and those are the two tracks that have jumped out at me initially.     One more thing about quality, this is not just a Metallic thing, or a metal \\"loudness\\" thing, it's an MP3 thing. It's massively compressed music, it's not perfect. If you hook up a decent turntable, AKA a record player (plays those big black round things your parents have ;p), you will notice a difference. Play some old classic LPs and compare them to the old classic MP3s, there's just an amazing difference. I know, not news to the audiophiles.     Bottom line, Metallica is BACK with this release, and hopefully they have a few more in them. Enjoy!

I'll always be grateful for that, because I feel like I'm one of a select few on the planet who witnessed what has to be the most amazing multi media extravaganza ever. I know that the Berlin version of this was even bigger, but was essentially a mishmash of artists (more like a pageant than a self-contained performance) and, frankly, without David Gilmour's pristine vocals and weeping guitar, it's just not the same. And I also understand that the Berlin show was fraught with technical problems that weren't present in the flawless version I saw, which I believe was the very first show they did in L.A.    This live recording is absolutely fantastic, and highly recommended. I've always found the original album to be fairly suffocating, especially in the later stages, but the live sound version gives the music some space and breathing room, and contains the patented technical mastery that PF is known for.     The musical virtuosity of this band was really amazing, and it's definitely on display on this CD. I remember being incredibly impressed by the fidelity of the sound system at the time. During the \\"One Of My Turns\\" sequence when the groupie enters the room, all the lights were out, and it was like you were actually in a hotel suite.  To some extent that quality is preserved here--but I certainly don't have a sound system to equal Pink FLoyd's. I was also impressed with the lighting rigs, which moved around the stage to accommodate where the performers were behind the ever-smaller holes in the wall.    It's just a tragedy that there's no film record of this show(at least one that's been released). The thing that's missing on CD is the constantly surprising, jaw-dropping visual inventiveness that accompanied the music. A crashing airplane, giant puppets, a flying pig, brilliant animated sequences. All that and a wall which throughout the first half grew brick by brick, creating a sense of tension that fed into the narrative and made you wonder--would they ever finish it in time? And how could the band behind the wall could continue with the show? And then the wall itself became a screen for Gerald Scarfe's mind-altering animation and also, incredibly, opened up to reveal a hotel room stage.    The band seemed to have spared no expense on this show, and that a complete film record is virtually lost forever is a great tragedy, but I'm so glad I have my memories, and now the live recording allows me to relive that incredible experience. I think this CD will be my preferred version of The Wall now.
0743216385|4.0|I highly recommend this book. I bought it because of the Band of Brothers TV series. I got hooked with the story. I enjoy reading novels and documentaries about WWII, but this book is different than a novel. It is plain record of events that took place in real life. Amazingly told and related. Greatly structured and written in a fashion that is pretty easy to read. The story evolves like the best of the novels. You really get attached to the characters and get to know them prety well. Great job by Ambrose.  This is a must if you like army stories, want to read a good book, and by the way learn some history about one of the greatest soldier group and events of the greatest of wars in history.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|It's bad enough that comedies today, whether on TV or in the movies, rely so heavily on sexual humor (a sign IMO that the writer's cannot come up with anything legitimately funny). This, however, goes far beyond sex jokes into the pronographic.
B00065GX64|5.0|This movie is the perfect example of what Fritz Lang is capable of.  His technique is extrodinary.      Purchase Scarlett Street also.  It is another fantastic Fritz Lang Film Noir title.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|In my opinion this is a great album.  Alot of people compare it to Ride the lightening, i think its a mix of master of puppets and And justice for all. If you have ever liked metallica you should give this album a chance.  I know that St. Anger was their worst album, but they really bounced back on this one.  This is the best album they have released in 17 years.  I think it is in the top four of their albums, maybe top 3. Im sure some people will disagree with me, but that is ok. Everyone has their own taste in music.    Bottom line, if you like, or have ever liked metallica, check this album out. If you are afraid to buy it because you havent heard it, go to their website and listen to the whole album first, heres the link...  [...]   Have fun! Its awesome!!!!
B001BGTWXI|5.0|After four long years, Iowa's nine man metal army Slipknot have finally returned with their latest album &#34;All Hope Is Gone&#34; which is definitely without question the band's best album thus far as well as one of the best metal CD's of 2008. Being a fan of Slipknot myself, I've highly anticipated this album for quite some time because I knew it was going to be great, and when I finally got it at FYE and listened to it, it was even better than I expected. With Dave Fortman producing and Colin Richardson handling mixing duties, &#34;All Hope Is Gone&#34; is (which I mentioned earlier) Slipknot's best, strongest, and most mature album to date. The previous album &#34;Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses&#34; from 2004 showcased Slipknot evolving and maturing musically by incorporating guitar solos, thrash metal riffing, acoustic guitars, and more melodic choruses, well here on &#34;All Hope Is Gone&#34; they continue in that direction and rightfully so. While this album does maintain the melodies that were found on &#34;Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses&#34;, it still maintains the brute force and heaviness on the 1999 self titled debut and &#34;Iowa&#34; as well. As a band and as musicians, Slipknot truly get better and better with each album they put out. Corey Taylor is a great vocalist, he has a great scream and growl that is just angry and can be downright intense, and he also has a fantastic melodic singing voice as well. Jim Root and Mick Thompson's guitar playing is great and very heavy too. The riffs are much better sounding, and I was very impressed with the solos as well. I'm really glad that they started soloing more often. Drummer Joey Jordison does an all around excellent job behind the kit as usual, and he can sure slam the double bass with the best of them. Joey is definitely one of metal's best drummers as well as one of my favorite drummers.<br /><br />After the opening intro &#34;.execute.&#34;, the album immediately blasts into the real opening track &#34;Gematria (The Killing Name)&#34; which echoes vintage Slipknot and features fast blood pumping riffs, breakneck double bass drum onslaughts, ruthless screaming vocals from Corey, and there's also some great soloing around the 2:35 mark, and I also like the part where Corey screams out &#34;WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?&#34; Track three &#34;Sulfur&#34; is highlighted by more slamming double bass kicks in the beginning, and also features a great melodic chorus and another great guitar solo to boot. The next track and the album's first single &#34;Psychosocial&#34; is definitely one of the album's best tracks which features a catchy, groovy, driving, mosh pit worthy drum beat, hard driving, headbanging worthy riffage, heart pumping shouting vocals, including a fist pumping shout of &#34;PSYCHOSOCIAL&#34;, and there's also another awesome solo around 2:18, and after the solo we have some great machine gun like riffs and skin cracks, and I like the shout of &#34;THE LIMITS OF THE DEAD&#34;. &#34;Dead Memories&#34; is a great melodic, mid tempo ballad that features great melodic vocals from Corey as well as some nice melodic soloing, while &#34;Butcher's Hook and &#34;This Cold Black&#34; are heavier, hard hitting songs that harken back to the band's earlier days (the latter mentioned song is highlighted by more assaultive, slamming double bass kicks, massive, loud crushing riffs, mosh pit worthy screams, and another awesome solo to boot). Track eleven &#34;Snuff&#34; is a nice slow ballad which is highlighted by some nice acoustic guitars and more great mellow vocals from Corey, while the closing title track is an all out heavy, blistering, bludgeoning beatdown that is highlighted by ruthless, battering drum work, rageful vocals, including catchy shout along choruses, thrashing walls of menacing, shredding riffs and a fast, wailing solo as well. This song is another highlight on this album, and guaranteed to be a concert favorite in the near future.<br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. .execute. (1:48) - N/A<br />2.

All Hope Is Gone (4:44) - 5/5<br /><br />Overall, like I said before, &#34;All Hope Is Gone&#34; is the best album that Slipknot have to offer thus far, and it truly shows how these guys continue to improve, mature, and most importantly evolve as a band and as musicians. This album definitely makes a worthy contender for best metal CD of 2008 as well. So if you're a fan of Slipknot, then by all means, you must buy this album. Great job Corey, Joey, Jim, Mick, Chris, Clown, Sid, Paul, and Craig. Well, I'm outta here, later!!!(1:48) - N/A 2. Gematria (The Killing Name) (6:01) - 5/5 3. Sulfur (4:37) - 5/5 4.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|All of the Goldfrapp albums are rich works of art, but that is especially true in the case of \\"Seventh Tree.\\"  Here more than ever, sound, music and that remarkable voice, are just the mediums by which Will Gregory and Alison Goldfrapp convey their artistic vision.<br /><br />Although Alison has explained how there is more \\"space\\" in the music of \\"Seventh Tree\\" than in, say, \\"Supernature,\\" where, as she put it, there is always something popping or exploding within the soundscape ... the depth of work that is presented here is staggering.  I have listened to this album over and over hundreds of times now, and seen it performed live twice, and still, whatever I choose to focus on in any of the tracks, I find to remarkably more abundant than in the work of any other modern performer.  Where other albums might be a stream to skip through, \\"Seventh Tree\\" is an ocean to swim in ... where another artist's track is something to listen to, \\"Seventh Tree\\" is a world to live in.<br /><br />My favorite performance on the album is \\"Some People.\\"  In the lyrics, Alison is cutting sharply into her own skin, and in the structure of the piece, one finds something much more akin to a short story than a song.  But if you just want to hear some terrific music, listen to the violins, listen to the prowling piano riffs that mark the developments in story.<br /><br />Follow the album up with the single of \\"Caravan Girl\\" that has the choral version of that song ... the finest audio recording I've ever heard, and the only one that has surpassed the best vinyl I've been privileged to hear.
B001DRF84W|5.0|While most people out there will tell you that this film isn't very good or even that it's downright bad, the majority of those people didn't/don't ever read the original comic series for the Hulk. The stories of the Hulk aren't about a costumed hero fighting criminals. They are about a man consumed with anger, who is driven to great lengths trying to deal w/his affliction, and the villainous characters who attempt to take advantage of Hulk and his gamma-powered strength. This film is about as \\"deep\\" as one could want from a film about a \\"superhero\\", while retaining it's strong comicbook feel.<br /><br />Ang Lee's direction in this film is evident in it's character-driven plot, sensitive view of the relationship between father/child, and the traumatic effects of coming from a home broken by tragedy. The film has amazing performances by Eric Bana (Bruce Banner), Jennifer Connelly (Betty Ross), and Sam Elliot (General Ross). Bana's Banner is an intelligent and principled man who struggles deeply w/feelings of abandonement. Connelly plays a woman who has struggled to help a man torn apart by anger and doubt, with compassion and understanding. Sam Elliott turns in another fantastic performance as General Ross - a fiery, old soldier who's anger towards and distrust of Banner are softened by his deep-seated affection for his daughter.<br /><br />This film is a great example of how the comicbook movie need not be riddled with comedic undertones and can still draw in those w/an open mind - truly, a modern classic.
B000OVLBIU|2.0|Ghost Rider has a thin plot and corny dialogue. The movie fails to pull the audience and excite them. the CGI involved is the highlight of the film but not enough to make it a success. Maybe children below 15 years of age might enjoy the movie but anybody looking for real (or not even that real) substance will be let down by this film. Avoid it if possible.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This film is about one thing and one thing only: action. The film starts off w/the credits flying by in a haze of flashback scenes depicting the Hulk's origins, getting around the hour-long development which \\"plagued\\" the previous version (HULK - 2003). After the flashback sequences are finished, the movie throws you directly into the story as it has developed thus far. Banner is in hiding from the US Army, in South America, attempting to cure himself of the curse that has afflicted him. The film quickly moves into action, w/a chase sequence which leads the viewer through back streets and over the rooves of an enormous 3rd world city of shacks and decaying apartment buildings. One of the most popular scenes in the film takes place on a college campus, where military personnel attempt to take Banner into custody, but instead cause him to transform into his enormous, green counterpart.<br /><br />An action movie through and through, this film still has good performances from Edward Norton and Tim Roth. Less than Incredible performances from Liv Tyler and William Hurt keep this movie from attaining too much life, though. Roth's enjoyable portrayal of the self-centered and egomaniacal Major Emil Blonsky keeps things moving along despite sharing numerous scenes w/Hurt's slow and lackluster atttempts at character portrayal. Live Tyler works w/what she's given in this film which, unfortunately, wasn't much. Better writing for the character of Betty Ross would have been nice, but is not absolutely necessary, as Miss Ross' character is used primarily as a driving force for the Hulk's outbursts. When Hulk isn't about to be on-screen, her lines are primarily of a semi-comedic nature, which keeps the film feeling lightweight and fun, albeit nothing more.<br /><br />Overall, this film is just about everything the 2003 version was not - an over-the-top action-adventure story, full of cars being ripped apart and earth-shaking punches. If you want Incredible action, the IncredibleHulk delivers.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|It certainly is this time around.<br /><br />Daredevil - the Director's Cut, is what the theatrical release was intended to be, when the film was being made. Contractual obligations kept the film from being released in theaters as R-rated, opting instead to cut out many key sequences to achieve a PG-13 rating. This version carries a good deal more weight behind it, with a greatly expanded-upon story and adding back in character development scenes. The movie still struggles through the awkward and out-of-place playground fight scene which is so very out-of-character for Matt Murdock, but the rest of the film hits much closer to home for the horned protaganist.<br /><br />Ben Affleck makes a surprisingly good attempt at portraying Murdock/Daredevil, in this action-adventure film. His scenes as Murdock w/the affable \\"Foggy\\" Nelson are a pleasure to watch, but he's able to make the transition to the grim and all-too-breakable vigilante, as well. Michael Clarke Duncan's turn as a street-grown version of the Kingpin is interesting and works well enough within the framework of the story, that the departure from the character's origins is negligible for all but the truly hardcore. More-involved fight sequences and fewer romance scenes give this version of the film better pacing and help to center the viewer on the character of Murdock/Daredevil, rather than his relationship w/ hum-drum Jennifer Garner and her less-than-stellar tv actor-quality performances and fight scenes.<br /><br />Overall, this film is still flawed and an uninspired take on the character of Daredevil and the stories of Hell's Kitchen, but it is a far cry better than the theatrical release. In comparison to it's theatrical release, this film is on a whole new level. Fans of Daredevil and comics in general will be able to enjoy this film, despite it's numerous flaws.
0743290119|2.0|The book is such a drag and I think the author ran out of ideas to keep her characters lives interesting.. She kept recycling the content over and over again. Sometimes authors should go out when they at the top.. This is not anywhere close to Devil wears Prada caliber! Waste of time..
B000NDIAWY|5.0|My interest in \\"The Story\\" started during the Summer Olympics with a haunting voice, for a very institutional General Motors commercial. The same voice could be heard on a few re-runs of Grey's Anatomy. The GM website was very accomodating in providing a web jump to \\"The Story\\". The music written and performed by Brandi Carlile brings an appreciation for her range and skills as a singer. A type of CD that you'll play over and over again, because so many of the tracks are wonderful.
0375704027|4.0|This is the third book by Haruki Murakami I read (after Sputnik and South of the Border) and the best so far. Originally written in 1987, the book begins in an airport in Germany, as the titular song by the Beatles playing in the sound system makes middle age Toru Watanabe remember his life as a college student in the late 1960s. As a drama student living in a pension in Tokyo he has to chose between the love of the unstable Naoko (a friend from high school, girlfriend of a friend of Watanabe that commited suicide, and who now lives in a sort of asylum in rural Japan) and the increasing approaches of his college classmate Midori. Meanwhile, he makes two friends: the nerdy, cleanliness obsessed, geography student nicknamed \\"Storm Trooper\\" and the ladies man Nagasawa, an amoral student who plans to enter Japan's diplomatic corps. A great book about remembrances, love and the joy and occasional sadness of young life. Perhaps not for the prurrient, since, as in other books by Murakami, explicit sex often punctuates the story.
0142002038|2.0|Published in 1958, \\"Doctor No\\" is a transitional novel for the James Bond series. Gone is much of the moral queasiness, realism, and psychological turmoil of earlier tales. In its place is a Walther PPK, vodka martinis shaken not stirred, and a supervillain living in a hidden fortress. Given all that, \\"Doctor No\\" should be fun at least, but it's not.<br /><br />Set in Jamaica, site of earlier series entry \\"Live And Let Die\\" and the last Fleming novel, \\"The Man With The Golden Gun\\", \\"Doctor No\\" has Bond investigating the disappearance of two British secret agents. The trail leads to the title character, a six-foot-six bald man with metal pincers for hands, metal contact lenses, and an interest in harvesting guano from an island just beyond Jamaica called Crab Key. No doubt Bond knows No's up to no good. Soon 007 is in the clutches of a madman, facing an imminent and horrible death just as soon as No explains what he's all about over a nice meal.<br /><br />Maniac, you call him? No couldn't agree more: \\"All the greatest men are maniacs. They are possessed by a mania which drives them forward towards their goal.\\"<br /><br />What's driving Fleming here is less clear. He seemed to resent having to bring Bond back from death at the end of his last book, really putting the character through the torture test this time. There's a casual cruelty to this book that makes it hard to digest as entertainment. I had a real Quarrel with the fate of one cool Bond ally. And the finale is about as silly as Fleming ever got, Bond fighting tarantulas and an octopus for some silly test of No's that the villain himself can't even bother to watch to completion while there's bird dung to harvest. The villain's fate suggests a sad laugh by a disillusioned author at his readers' gullibility.<br /><br />Good points include some decent descriptive mileage regarding the mangrove swamps of Crab Key and the social life of Kingston; both the rich whites who live in the affected splendor of the Queen's Club \\"which for fifty years has boasted the power and frequency of its blackballs\\", and the blacks who play calypso and drink Red Stripe at scenic outdoor cafes. There's also Honeychile Rider, Bond's latest lady. The movie version famously gave us Ursula Andress in this role, but the character in the book exudes vulnerability more than hotitude, and her backstory is one of the best of any Bond woman.<br /><br />The movie \\"Doctor No\\" was what launched the whole 007 movie phenomenon, still alive and very well at this writing. You can see how it was the right choice, too, as everything here is amped up for cinematic consumption. No lives inside a seaside cliff with a transparent face, so he can watch all the creatures swimming around. Instead of sending men with guns to shoot the birds he doesn't want on his island, he has them drive around in an automotive contraption disguised as a dragon, complete with flame-thrower inside its mouth.<br /><br />Alas, these ideas would be more welcome if Fleming knew what to do with them. Unfortunately, his much-talked-about \\"Fleming Sweep\\" sputters once the story kicks into a higher gear.<br /><br />\\"Doctor No\\" is a series low point that ironically became a franchise high point thanks to the movie.

B00000JR2A|5.0|The Seeds of Love is Tears for Fears' masterpiece. While their previous album (Songs from the Big Chair) gave the band a succession of memorable hit singles, The Seeds of Love shows Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal reaching their musical peak.  Also worth noting is the inclusion of then unknown gospel singer Oleta Adams, whose soulful vocals added another great dimension to their sound. The song that everyone knows here is \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\", a brilliant track that may be the most complex hit single of recent times. From its Beatlesque arrangements and intelligent lyrics to the soaring vocals of both Orzabal and Smith, this, along with \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Shout\\", is among the best songs penned in the `80s. Just as impressive musically is the excellent \\"Badman's Song\\", where Smith, Orzabal, and Adams trade vocals throughout as the tune bounces from progressive rock to gospel to jazz before reaching its climactic end. \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\", an excellent new wave tune with a great lead vocal from Smith, is the best of `80s British pop and should have been a huge hit. Another highlight is the awesome \\"Swords and Knives\\", another dramatic tune with a lot of twists and turns and great guitar work from Orzabal. The rest of the tunes are nearly as impressive as the opener \\"Woman in Chains\\" is laid back and features great camaraderie between Orzabal and Adams while \\"The Year of the Knife\\" is driving and quite heavy.  \\"Standing on the Corner of the Third World\\" is another great tune, more steeped in jazz than rock, and sounds like something Sting would have recorded on ...Nothing Like The Sun. \\"Famous Last Words\\" is a gentle tune that closes out the original album nicely. Even the bonus tracks here are very good as \\"Music for Tables\\" is a great jazz instrumental while \\"Tears Roll Down\\" is very heavy on the percussion and resembles their more new wave material. All told, The Seeds of Love shows Tears for Fears maturing from a great `80s pop/new wave outfit to a band that would have been great in any era. Highest recommendation.new wave outfit to a band that would have been great in any era. Highest recommendation.
031606792X|1.0|By tradition, I have to say SPOILERS ALERT here.  By opinion, I have to say the book is spoiled already.    I don't think I've ever seen a worse case of missed opportunity than Breaking Dawn.  While I practically ate up the previous three novels - especially the first one - I had to force myself to even finish this last installment.  Twilight was unquestionably the best of the series, and while the following two novels were interesting, I don't think I'm the only one who could see a steady decline in storytelling, leading up to this extremely disappointing conclusion to the series.    The first three novels set up a scenario with, I think, four primary things we, the readers, were looking forward to seeing get satisfactorily concluded.    1.  BELLA AND EDWARD FINALLY PHYSICALLY CONSUMMATING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.    Wow, were we ever strung along through 3 thick books of desire and denial, passion and restraint with these two characters.  Didn't we look forward to some level of intimacy being introduced in this finale?  But what do we get?  A barely-insinuated get-together with a rather rapid fade to black, then it's the next morning for them.  I had to go back a few pages, thinking, \\"Wait... What?  Did they do it or not?\\"  OK, I understand the delicate situation here for a writer, seeing as her audience is primarily a younger generation.  But that's no excuse.  If you compare this situation to that of the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and I hate to, as it insults that show), which was also begun aimed at a young, teenage audience, the writers realized that as that show grew and matured over time, so did its audience, and thus, the show gradually became more adult in its themes.  Stephenie Meyer had the perfect opportunity here of giving young girls some hint of what they should expect from newly discovered intimacy, and how they should be treated in such a situation.  She could have handled it subtly - at least have a passionate kissing scene leading into the fade to black.  Something MORE than the bland, empty scene we got.  But apparently she thought that would be too mature for her audience.    Yet having a scene where Edward bites through the fetal sack of Bella's bone-crushing parasite baby, with blood splattered all over the place was better?    2.  EDWARD MAKING BELLA A VAMPIRE.    Again, we were strung along.  Bella pleaded for this through three novels.  She insisted it be Edward who make her one of them, thus setting up the idea that, despite the fact becoming a vampire would be very painful for her, all of that would be preceded by some intense and passionate moment where he actually bites her.  Isn't this the whole point of a romantic vampire novel?  The girl actually and finally gets bitten?!  I think we were also curious as to how that would play out.  Would he be able to control himself and not kill her when he did this?    Instead, what did we get?  Edward injecting her with a venom-filled hypodermic, after a particularly horrid scene of childbirth.      3.  SEEING WHAT BELLA WOULD BE LIKE AS A VAMPIRE.    We were led up to this point, with the warnings she might be a monster.  I don't know about you, but I was looking forward to seeing sweet, clumsy, awkward Bella becoming a complete nut for a while. I thought it also plausible - and even a fascinating idea - that she might become the major threat in the last novel.  The \\"villain\\".  How cool might that have been?  The Volturi would come to try and stop her, but with her powers of resistance, even they would have a difficult time bringing her under control...    Instead, Bella was tame, unaffected.  In fact, she became BORING. Or maybe just MORE so.    4.  DECISIONS, DECISIONS. WOULD BELLA CHOOSE EDWARD OR JACOB?    There was really no question she'd choose Edward, but what would happen to Jacob?  How would that be resolved?  Would he give himself over to the wild completely, or die to resolve this?      The answer we got:  Have him imprint on Bella's BABY,for crying out loud!  Even though we'd previously been given the distinct impression he'd already imprinted on Bella, and there was no way around that.    CONCLUSION: I have a hard time imagining how true fans of this series were happy with this last novel.  Even the characters didn't seem like themselves, to the sad point where I felt like the chemistry between Bella and Edward was completely dead.  As I was reading this book, I sometimes wondered if some other (bad) author had written it, because it was just so incredibly inconsistent with the character development, wit, and dialog style of the previous books.  (It's really suspicious to me how many people have said it's like SMeyer didn't even write it, especially considering another novel by her was released about the same time.  Have we been duped?) It makes me sick to think of all the GOOD writers out there being rejected repeatedly by publishing companies, while this tripe goes through and SMeyer gets rich off of it.  There is no justice.    MY RECOMMENDATION:  Quit with the first novel, Twilight.  Pretend that last scene in it is Edward biting her and just drop it.      Addendum: My sympathies go out to the screenwriters who had to deal with this garbage and turn it into a script.

As a piano music lover I can only say that I've listened to this CD for so many hours that I hear it in my dreams.  And that's not a bad thing!
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I would have liked to see at least 2 XLR outputs also but I guess that would be too expensive to build into a small inexpensive mixer like this. it's a great product and does what it says it will do. and amazon of course shipped it right away as usual
0395631246|5.0|Required reading in most negotiation classes I am told by my professor at UNH. I think it's an excellent book, we use two, this and \\"Bargaining for Advantage\\" by Richard Shell.  I personally like the shell book better as it's more methodical which my brain processes more easily.  Having said that, this book is also very good.
B0014XCMVM|2.0|Alanis can write beautiful lyrics and melodies and perform them wonderfully on CD.  But, don't bother to go see her in concert if you think your going to get that kind of experience.  Her concert is noise, noise, noise.  Her sound people should be fired for destroying her music.  Buy the CD, skip the concert.
0930289234|5.0|I've got a confession to make, and I'll say it right here so there's no doubt about it: Before \\"Watchmen,\\" I had never read a graphic novel.  I remember, as a boy, my mother purchasing me a comic book (or two, if I was exceptionally good, which I really tried to be) from the local grocery store.  I think I collected a grand total of ten.  They never really moved me.  They never interested me, until later, after I gained a bit more literary experience.  Now in my early 20's, I noticed a lot of my friends enjoy comics and graphic novels; I decided that I should give them a try as well.  All this being said: I shall not judge \\"Watchmen\\" as a graphic novel, for I am not qualified to do so.  But being an avid reader of novels, short stories, essays, nonfiction, poetry, and song lyrics, I shall judge \\"Watchmen\\" as a work of literature.  And the verdict?  A masterpiece.<br /><br />1985 in some alternate universe, where Nixon is still president (dear God), we won the Vietnam War (not as great as you might think), and superheroes were once part of American culture.  Spurred by comic books, ordinary men and women took up costumes and monickers, patrolling the streets of their cities.  Some of them even united together.  But, in 1985, the only operative superheroes are those sponsored by the government: like Doc Manhattan, once a man, now possessed of indescribable capabilites; and the Comedian, a rough and tumble anti-hero (I hesitate to include \\"hero\\" at all) who has just been murdered.<br /><br />Rorschach, a masked vigilante who was once a hero and is now wanted for murder, investigates.  He sees a disturbing pattner.  A \\"mask killer\\"--someone out to kill superheroes.  Teaming up (if somewhat reluctantly, on their behalf) with retired heroes the Nite Owl (II) and the Silk Spectre (II), he sets out to investigate what happened, uncovering a conspiracy to rival all conspiracies, one that may just lead to World War III...<br /><br />Ah, okay.  Obligatory plot summary out of the way.  It doesn't begin to cover it; \\"Watchmen\\" is so layered with subtext and imagery, a mere summary of the novel's surface plot is almost an indulgent excess.  Let me just say this: Alan Moore is a paranoid but fantastic writer, and Dave Gibbons is a gifted (and slightly disturbed, all for the better) illustrator.  I could not put \\"Watchmen\\" down; I had the fortune to read it while I was sick (and thus equipped with a dandy of an excuse to skip class).  I'm not sure it made me feel any healthier...in fact, much to the contrary...but it inspired me to delve deeper into this literary medium.  I'm not sure if anything I read from now on will stand up to \\"Watchmen;\\" I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed my forray into this twisted and cruel (and utterly realistic) world, and that I am a wiser and more cautious person for it.he way.

B0018S6YO4|3.0|Rihanna was never the strongest singer.  She never tried to be something she wasn't.  She is a pop singer and sometimes an R&B singer.  I didn't really listen to any of the songs from the original \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" but I decided to listen to it when she re-released it.  I guess she wanted to release more singles so she gave us a 2nd helping of the 2007 album.  The new songs are pretty good.  Ne-Yo wrote her song (by himself this time) \\"Take A Bow\\" which could be a ripoff of Madonna's song \\"Take A Bow.\\"  it has similar lyrics and is a ballad.  \\"Disturbia\\" is another great new song which seems to be about mental illness (Britney, anyone?).  I like the new songs better than some of the songs on the original album, but I still find \\"Push Up On Me\\" to be addictive.  Overall I'd say this is Rihanna's best album.  She has a long way to go before making a perfect or classic album, but this definately helps her reputation more.  I still give props to Rihanna for delivering fun singles that we can dance or sing along to.
0446615641|4.0|I picked this book up in the Airport in Atlanta and read it flying to Los Angeles.  It was a perfect book to eat up flight time as it was fast paced and entertaining.  I liked the author's writing style as it kept me glued to the book.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read.  It would make a good movie as I could see Tommy Lee Jones playing Oliver Stone.
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|2008 brought us some pretty bad albums, but \\"One of The Boys\\" probably tops that list.  I really disliked the #1 single \\"I Kissed A Girl\\", and her new song \\"Hot N Cold\\" sounds like a ripoff of Alanis Morisette.  I don't like any of the songs on this album.  I never hated an album more.  Music has seemed to go downhill lately and I hope it gets better.  From Rihanna's ear torture single \\"Disturbia\\" to Chris Brown's horrible song \\"Forever.\\"  I seriously hope there are better albums later in 2008 because I am very dissapointed with the music scene right now.  Sorry Katy but this album is horrible, one of the worst of 2008 along with Miley Cyrus.
0316067601|5.0|Wow, this book was quite revealing in both SEAL training and discipline and what happened on that fateful \\"Redwing\\" mission.  I heard about the Medal of Honor being given to Lt Murphy posthumously but did not know the details of why.  This book takes you right to the front line and gets you as close as possible to what these guys experienced.    My hat goes off to all of them.  Thank you for your service!
B000WC3A0S|4.0|This is good movie, but it is not the greatest sports film of all time. It works because it is a basic story about a guy who has been a loser all his life getting the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make something of himself. It also works as a love story between two people who basically are misfits finding each other and falling in love. The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end. However, the main thing that ruins this film's reputation are the endless sequels that came after it. If they had stopped at two, maybe I would accept this film as a classic.
B000063DHL|5.0|After the physically excrutiating World Slavery Tour, which lasted 11 months and consited of 193 shows, Maiden took sixth month a break to recharge their batteries and in January 1986, got back together to write their first album to feature synths: SOMEWHERE IN TIME. This was the first album NOT to be part of the Golden Years era, and the first of their \\"Experimentation\\" era.<br /><br />This is Maiden's best 80s album they ever recorded. Best listening  setting would be on a cold winter night, in the house with a fire going on and the lights out. But really, it's great anytime and anywhere.<br /><br />CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME: 10+/10: BEST MAIDEN OPENER EVER. From the moment that the Blade Runner-ish intro to the song blasts out of the speakers, you're in for a very fun ride! The song goes into a gallop that is fast, heavy, and awesome, and contains the 2nd most amazing Guitar solo from Adrian! This song sounds great live too, in fact the Osaka '87 bootleg version sounds fantastic.<br /><br />WASTED YEARS: 9/10: A beautiful song with amazing lyrics. Apparently the band wrote this while on the World Slavery Tour, and you can tell. Bruce's voice is fantastic on this, and the intro is pretty cool.<br /><br />SEA OF MADNESS: 10+/10: Maiden's heaviest track yet, and maybe even the best song on the album! Bruce's voice soars, and the guitar truly makes the song. The vocal haromony is great.<br /><br />HEAVEN CAN WAIT: 8/10: Very catchy and singalong-able track, and the bridge is very popular where fans go onstgage at concerts and sing the oohing part. I wish I was onstage at the show I went to, especially with my favorite band (Maiden, of course)! This sounded fantastic at the show I went to on June 6th!<br /><br />THE LONLINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: 9/10: The tediousness of the ridiculously long title, but other than that, this song ROCKS!!!!! The gallop is fantastic, Bruce's vocals shine on the album here. And the \\"I've got to keep ruuuunning...\\" part just blows me away everytime I hear it.<br /><br />STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND: 10/10: A catchy song that does a good job at creating a desperate mood. Definitely creates a video in your head too, of a desperate man lost and looking for help.<br /><br />DEJA VU: 4/10: This song isn't that bad, but the song sounds like it was recorded in one take (in other words rushed- Moonchild was recorded in one take but at least it sounded awesome), plus Bruce sounds awful on this song.<br /><br />ALEXANDER THE GREAT: 10/10: A fantastic epic song that creates the \\"warrior\\" feel. Time signature change is very prominent here, and Bruce and Adrian truly shine, as well as Nicko's drumming is fantastic.<br /><br />Overall, this is Maiden's best 80s album. I got it back in Febuary and have loved it ever since. BRAVE NEW WORLD is my favorite Maiden album, but this one still rocks! Buy it if you don't have it!STRANGE LAND: 10/10: A catchy song that does a good job at creating a desperate mood.

B000002H97|4.0|This album has been labled as the moment Metallica \\"sold out.\\"  I've heard that phrase so much I'm almost not sure what it means anymore.  And to the die-hard fans that creamed their pants for Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning, I guess I can see your point.  Gone are the days of speed metal, the riffs are slower, the tempos much mellower, the bass isn't nearly as epic as when Burton played (RIP).  But to completely knock the band and the album is being overly harsh.  This is a great album if you take it in context.  It's not trying to be a thrash album, it's not supposed to be a speed metal album, and if that's all you really want from Metallica then I'd advise you stay in the 80s, cause that sound won't be created again...not even by Metallica.  I don't like this entire album, I consider 3 or 4 songs to be filler, but the good songs are damn good and that makes up for the filler.  The solos are much slower than in previous albums but they have that epic sound to them that Metallica hinted on with ...And Justice For All but never fully reached.  And while the slower songs like Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters have grown old on me (their solos haven't), there's no denying that Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam, and Enter Sandman are just great cuts.  Sadly, the one attempt of a sped-up tempo (Holier Than Thou) falls flat in my opinion and I wish they would've just left it off the record.  In any case, this is an epic album and one of the all time classics.  It's also quite possibly the last good album Metallica will ever make...so cherish it for what it is.
B00186DV1U|4.0|Though the first billing of this show was Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich was the real star deservedly earning himself the Best Supporting Actor nomination. No offence to Mr Landau's impeccable performance in Ed Wood but I bet the Oscars are going to do the same to Malkovich some time when he's a senior too. It's your usual run-after-the-bad-guy thriller but Malkovich's evil portrayal of the screwed up assassin maniac will keep you watching, even if you know he's going to die in the end (typically Hollywood!). He's a bad guy you love to hate and though he's supposed to be the evil one, you can't help but like him simply coz he's just so evil, you know like Alan Rickman in Robin Hood or Gary Oldman in Dracula. Brilliant movie for both guys and gals to watch together.

Now transferred to DVD, so much more detail seems to be available - including greatly improved sound.

For those with little interest in the history of that time, Gettyburg is a clear reminder of what today the USA stands for - thats freedom.

The best book I have ever read that exposes the false self (EGO) and how the primary job of the ego is to take your happiness away and create all kinds of problems every day.    Here's the ego's program that it is running to justify it's existance \\"Never Satisfied\\"    No matter how a situation turns out, the ego will find a way to be unhappy about it.     P.S. The book is so good, I ran out and bought extra copies for all my friends and family.

B0009MWAVQ|5.0|Even to \\"review\\" Scott Ross's 34 CD set from Warner (now in danger of being out of print)seems presumptuous. This feat, so stunning in every way, makes a mere Michael Phelps just another Guiness Book of Records item. What do a few more seconds of invisible swimming achievement have to offer me? Nothing.<br /><br />I know well and own recordings of these amazing harpsichord sonatas by Landowska, Kirkpatrick, Valenti, Pinnock, Kipnis, Belder and others. All have their virtues. But Ross's mastering of these 500 plus sonatas in a year or so, to produce non-mechanical, far from routine run-throughs, is sui generis. Ross seems influenced by Valenti, particularly, but retains an expressiveness and vitality that even Valenti began to lose as his old Westminster LPs were being spewed out.<br /><br />Even to \\"recommend\\" this set seems a bit ridiculous, like \\"recommending\\" the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Harold Fromm

B001DDBCUA|4.0|The Good: Carrie and the girls evolved just as you expected.  More sophisticated, with less casual sex and more of life's real issues -- to include infidelity, pregnancy, wedding madness, fear, loneliness, disappointment, and the end of a relationship (to name a few).  In typical Sex & the City style, the girls clip-clop through New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico looking haute in their couture, making witty jokes all while.  The series was given a great ending.  Each of the girls were able to find happiness in ways you may (or may not) have expected, but in the end you have a smile on your face.    The Bad: In truth, I saw the movie twice and wasn't annoyed at all by product placement.  I barely noticed it.  I focused my attention on dialog, content, and performances.  Yet, after a little googling I realized just how many scenes contained strategically placed brand names.  It's unfortunate, but a necessary evil to keep the girls in high style.  -- Second and along the same line:  Carrie is much more materialistic in the movie. In the series, she always loved her Minolos, Prada, and Dior, but labels were simply extras in her life.  In the movie, however, Carrie takes advantage of her relatively new wealth, purchasing and talking about more luxurious THINGS than ever before.  I couldn't decide if this was a normal progression for her character, or if it was over the top.    All in all, I loved the movie.

1596434252|5.0|The book is unique in a sense that I have never seen a pop-up book like that. It is visually a remarkable piece of innovation. Pop-up itself is not new, it is just that this is really well thought out book. What I mean is that the 3D image of Alphabet letters stick to your mind. So that the kids (targeted ages 4 through 8) can visually and spatially (in 3-D) learn the alphabet letters -- stimulating brain activity. In sum:<br />1. The book is about the Alphabet letters (no words, just letters) -- covering \\"A\\" to \\"Z\\" in a pop-up presentation. The unique feature is that Alphabet letters pop up in 3-D and it is artistic.<br />2. My kids (ages 3 & 5) love the book. They pull the pages to see the transformation the letters are making. It is quite well done. You could tell that kids find it interesting. They try to figure out how and why the letters pop up!!!<br />3. Pages are sturdy, but they are not stitched, but glued. It will fall apart in time.<br />4. The cover has holographic letters, so when you shift the book, the letters change.<br />5. The book is indeed for ages 4-8. My daughter who is 3 years old, almost ruined the letter \\"G\\" -- meaning she did something, and the book wouldn't close. But it is fixable. My son (5 years old) on the other hand, carefully uses the book.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fine book. Your kids would like it, but most of all, learn the letters in a stimulating way.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|I love this new collection of Dylan songs and I consider myself quite lucky since I was born in 1986 to be hearing New Dylan material after all he has been thru.I know a lot of people just cannot get over his voice and that doesn't really surprise me.Most people don't have the stomach for the amount of Raw Emotion that goes in it.I've heard people say his singing sounds like He's dying.And you know what;after seeing him live twice in the last two years,I must say I agree.When you listen to this man sing to you live in concert,it sounds like someone who wants to die onsatge.It's almost like his deathwish maybe.I am almost certain that how ever long Dylan live's he will be doing what he has always done.And quite honestly if you look at it all in perspective Bob Dylan has always been the artist in it for the long run.He's not even doing this work for himself,he's just doing it cause he's got to do it(watch the '65 interview)He has said \\"I see no end\\".I can't wait for \\"Tell Tale Sign's\\" to be released and maybe if were lucky he will have an album of more new songs to share with us soon.
0743298039|5.0|I am happy I got around to reading this atmospheric homage to the great Gothic novels of the past.  Although the author seems inspired by Du Maurier and the Bronte sisters, this novel is too well-crafted to be derivative.  The writer has a unique and singular talent which is a real pleasure to read.  The story moved at a swift pace for me personally, and I found myself purposely trying to slow down, so every twist would reveal itself in good time.  Ghosts, a mysterious mansion on the moors, creepy twins, what's not to like?  Rollicking good fun.
B001B1UO6W|4.0|Can it really be? Can one of the smallest icons of horror actually be turning 20 this year? Apparently so and MGM is ready to celebrate by releasing CHUCKY'S 20TH BIRTHDAY EDITION-CHILD'S PLAY.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the original film (or the four sequels), the story revolves around the Lakeshore Strangler in Chicago, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). As the film opens, Charles is on the run followed by dedicated cop Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). Abandoned by his cohort Eddie, Charles runs into a toy store only to be shot by Norris. Grabbing the nearest thing to a human as possible, Charles uses a voodoo incantation to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll.<br /><br />The scene changes to young Andy Barclay's (Alex Vincent) house. It's Andy's birthday and he's made mom Karen (Catherine Hicks) with the hope of opening his presents early. While he gets Good Guy toys, he doesn't get the all wonderful Good Guy doll, something his mother can't afford. But, as luck would have it, at work that day her friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) finds a peddler selling one for just $30. Andy's day is made! Or so he thinks.<br /><br />Things begin to happen, starting with the mysterious death of Maggie. Andy tells his mother that Chucky, the name of his particular talking Good Guy doll, is alive and talking to him. But no one believes Andy. And when they finally do, it's too late.<br /><br />Seems like a fairly simple story, right? Well, in fact, it is. But sometimes the most simple of stories lend themselves to the most frightening of images. What person hasn't been freaked out as a child by some doll that they or a friend owned? And what scarier image can there be than that of what has always been considered an image of childhood, a toy, coming to life to go on a murderous rampage, knife in hand?<br /><br />The movie offers these back and forth images, the innocent child and doll, with the possessed object wielding a knife or baseball bat in an attempt to kill. Not only that, but Chucky discovers that he will be imprisoned in this form forever if he doesn't transfer his soul into the first person who saw him, young Andy.<br /><br />When the film was released it was a hit. Abandoned were the horror heroes of the past, the vampire, the werewolf, the Frankenstein monster, replaced with new images like Jason, Freddy, Leatherface and, of course, Chucky. This film has the distinction of being different from the sequels in that Chucky has a more innocent look about him, a deceptive air that later changed to a snarling little puppet look. The image of Chucky is indeed one that can induce scares and nightmares for young and old alike.<br /><br />This new 20th BITHDAY EDITION comes packed with extras. The original making of featurette, a commentary tracks with Hicks, Vincent and effects master Kevin Yagher (who eventually married Hicks after meeting on this film), another commentary track by producer David Kirschner and screenwriter Don Mancini, as well as scene specific commentary by Chucky. You also get a slew of new featurettes made for this edition including The Birth of Chucky, Creating the Horror, and Unleashed.<br /><br />As I watched this film again for the first time in years, I was amazed at how effective it actually was. The suspense was well put together, the fears of the doll made real and the legend of Chucky was brought to life before my eyes. I'd forgotten how truly creepy some of the scenes were and even though I knew it was a combination of well engineered puppets in some scenes and little people in costume on oversized sets in others, you still felt that this doll was alive.<br /><br />I know of people today who still cringe when they see a Chucky doll. It's nice to know that after 20 years, an image like this can still induce a little well placed Hollywood fear. If you've never seen the film, it's worth watching.

0307269752|5.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO by Stieg Larsson is a great thriller. It also has an interesting history. Before making it to the USA, it was a phenomonal best seller in Europe. Also, Larsson died tragically in 2004. I'd never heard of the author, and the book summary sounded interesting but not overly compelling. What drew me to the novel was the incredible list of endorsers: Michael Connelly, Harlan Coben, John Lescroart and Lee Child. Knowing the quality of work from these authors, I decided to give the book a try, and you should too. Don't be intimidated by the Swedish origin of the novel. Nothing is lost in the translation.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist has just been found guilty of libeling industrialist Hans-Eric Wennerstrom in his magazine MILLENNIUM. Blomkvist accepts the verdict and agrees to take a leave of absence from the magazine and his business partner/part-time lover Erica Berger. Bllomkvist gets a call out of the blue from Henrik Vanger. Vanger is the patriarch of a fading Swedish conglomerate. Vanger has an assignment for Blomkvist. Spend a year writing a biography of the Vanger family, and while you are at it, secretly find out what happened to Harriet Vanger. Harriet disappeared in the 1960s and her disappearance has never been explained. Blomkvist is the primary focus of the novel as he tries to piece together a puzzle that happened 40 years ago. At the same time, he tries to find a way to get back at Wennerstrom.<br /><br />The heart of the novel belongs to Lisbeth Salander. She's 24 years old, disfunctional, has multiple tattoos and piercings. Due to tragic circumstances in her childhood, she's been declared incomptent, or crazy, and must be looked after by a ward of the state, even though she's 24. Lisbeth however, happens to be a genius with computers and has gotten a job with a computer firm. Plot twists bring her to work with Blomkvist, and together they make a great team.<br /><br />The plot has elements of business, political, and mystery thrillers. I've never read anything like it. Larsson's writing style in and of itself isn't great, but I found the story captivating. As an American, it is intersesting to read about life in a different culture. This thriller is getting a lot of publicity now as it finally makes its way to America. I think it is worth it.

0525948023|5.0|The book itself is an excellent read. Shame on Amazon for sending me such a damaged copy. The shipping box wasn't damaged at all, Amazon shipped it that way.
0385340990|5.0|I can't believe Oprah didn't pick up this great novel for her book club's latest list-I don't mean 'the Story of Edgar Sawtelle' is not qualified, though. However, I'm certain that this kind of book will survive even without such media coverages, for it'll reach every book lover all over the world just via  the word-of-mouths. That's the power of a great story with great characters.
0743277708|5.0|Alright, the first thing you need to know is that this is about rabbits.  Yes, rabbits, and not a childrens book.  It is a long book, and it is a complex book.  Even if you don't understand the complexities of the allegories that are involved with this book, it is still a fine read.  The writing is superb, and the characters pop right off of the page.  This book will stay with you long after you read it.  Not for its amazing points it makes, although they are in there, but really for its terrific storytelling, and wonderful language.  You can tell that this book was a labor of love for Richard Adams.  I don't need to describe the story for you, that is done above.  I don't need to talk about the allegorical significance of the various parts of the book, that is done in colleges all over the country.  What I do need to tell you is that if you read this book you won't be sorry.  I promise you won't even remember they are rabbits except in the smallest sense of yourself by the time you are a quarter of the way into the book.  By the end you might even find a tear or two for the ending.  So read it, enjoy it, and than pass it along to someone who you know will like it.  That was how I got it, and I have cherished it ever since.
0307269752|4.0|When I read the synopsis of the plot, I was immediately intrigued.  As this novel was unlike most of my usual reading selections, I expected a unique experience based upon the reviews throughout Europe...a highly acclaimed novel.  The main characters were easy to follow, although the Vanger family took some memory skills to keep their histories in mind.  Stieg Larsson seems to use his own journalistic background, the financial powerhouses, the complexity and revelatory computer hacking process, along with horrible depictions of mentally sick and abused individuals.  His main characters, while diverse, have their special set of ethics or circumstances which unite them in the continually unfolding story line.  The novel has prompted me to learn more about Mr. Larsson, now deceased, his work and achievements; and how they relate to the world outside of Sweden.  This was not a book that I read quickly, but not slowly either.  It was....different.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|Not only did this CD have the exact songs that I was looking for, but ones that I hadn't heard yet and just love.  Brad Paisley fans will not be disappointed with this one.

0393325172|5.0|Patrick O'Brian's series of seafaring novels is simply the best body of fictional work of the late 20th Century.  Great clattering naval battles alternate with reflective passages.  The humor which runs throughout the series is infectious.  Highly recommended.
B000GGSM7G|3.0|To all the reviewers who have complained about the drum roll at the start of \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" being edited, this is not the case. It's all there, but has been remastered such that it commences a fraction of a second prior to the start of track 1. To hear the beginning, you have to press play, then search backwards into the 2 second pre-gap. (Mind you, not all CD players will do this.) I think it's most unlikely this was done intentionally, and believe it to be a remastering error. An annoying one, yes, but not as bad as if they'd clipped off the beginning completely!
B00008OWZC|4.0|Possibly better than The Song Ramains the Same. If you like Led Zeppelin (considered one of the best rock bands and revalued generation after generation) I think this triple is a good choice. The singer is O.K (now his \\"Raising Sand\\" is astonishing), the guitarist is wonderful, the bassist sounds fine and the drummer was one of the best in this genre.
B0015519VS|5.0|Usher begins by dedicating his album: \\"To my Lord and saviour, you have revealed to me where I need to be and what I should be doing. Thank you for my life, my experiences, my struggles, and your grace and guidance to overcome the obstacles...\\" To which I give Usher credit (for his faith and standing up for what he believes in). Although he has made some mistakes along the way he has tried to do the right thing for his future.    His album has quite a few spiritual references including from the song Moving Mountains, an expression taken from the bible (see Matthew 17:20, 21:21 and Mark 11:23). Usher also quotes 1 Corinthians 13:11 in his liner notes \\"...When I was a child I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things...\\". The interlude Prayer For You is a prayer for protection, covering, and guidance for his son. In Best Thing feat Jay-Z, Usher also sings \\"...I've been to church, and I talked to the Bishop, and he wanted me to share this with you, how much I miss you, I'm so sorry I ran the streets, acted like the devil...\\"    Love In the Club was the first single I heard. Although the tune was infectious and lively, I was initially hesistant about it because of the lyrics. Afterall what person in their right mind would make love in a club \\"on the couch, on the table, on the bar, on the floor...\\" in front of everybody (please don't answer if that's you!)? I wondered what Usher's new wife would think of his single as well as his new child (when he grows up)? Although I can't answer for Foster, according to the goss she was apparently jealous of the actress in the video shoot.    I wondered what a married man would be doing singing a song like this, however Usher, himself, explains it \\"My first single takes you back to the beginning of my life story - [reintroducing] the guy who wanted to hustle and play in the club but eventually making his journey to lifetime\\". Although I enjoy this song, I do struggle with the morality of it. I am personally married so it doesn't bother me about the 'making love' part, but more the idea of having sex with a stranger in a club!    Trading Places is about a couple trading places in their daily roles as well as in the bedroom! It's got a lovely tune and is very romantic, but I only recommend it to the married, again, for obvious reasons.    Moving Mountains, the 2nd single released from the album, has to be one of my absolute favourites with its smooth sailing vocals demonstrating Usher's amazing vocal range. Combined with its video clip it's an extremely emotional and moving piece that Usher pulls off well. The song is about a lover whose \\"heart is obliterated\\" and trying to get through to her is like moving mountains (something that seems impossible). This song will touch the hearts of couples struggling under the weight of everyday pressures whom need to revive their love: \\"no matter what it takes I've got to get it together, baby\\".    What's Your Name feat will.i.am, the 3rd [Australian] single from the album is good for its addictive beat while Before I Met You shows a progression \\"I was a hustler and a player, girl, before I met you... but how you've made a difference... you've got my life together... and I thank you forever.\\" This seems to talk about the difference his new wife has made, who has helped settle Usher down and (along with his son) changed his whole perspective on life.    Then there is His Mistakes: \\"I'll do anything to prove I love you, but baby girl I refuse to pay for something I didn't do. I love you, girl. But I refuse to stay, paying for his mistakes...\\" I think this will hit home for people who have trouble trusting in love again after past relationships. Again, very moving.    Appetite which is introduced as a \\"true story\\" talks about the temptation to cheat and how easy you can cross that line. While Usher acknowledges the temptation he warns his listeners not to feed that appetite: \\"Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess, better give my girl my best, put my B.S under arrest, because I love my lady, fellas if you love your girl fight that appetite for the ladies...\\" This song also seems to suggest the dangers of internet pornography \\"But lately only late at night... I find it hard to sleep... I'm surfing all the sites... it's almost like I'm caught up in living another life, man I'm hungry for something I need to feed this appetite...\\"    Overall a great album showcasing Usher's amazing talent and ever-maturing voice. There is progression through the album from a young man who liked playing around (listen to Love In the Club Parts 1 and 2, What's Your Name, Before I Met You) to one who now wants to be responsible and stick by his wife and kids (listen to Prayer for You, Something Special, Before I Met You, Appetite, Lifetime, Here I Stand). The songs in between talk about the struggles between right and wrong, the old life and the new (listen to Moving Mountains, What's a Man to Do, Appetite). As Usher reveals in the album credits \\"This album has given me the opportunity to let my fans know who I am now, a different me, a changing me, a growing me. Here I Stand begins a new chapter in my life.\\"

0061122416|4.0|Reading this book, I had to keep stopping and thinking about the implications.  While at the surface the book seems to be a simple story, the implications are much deeper.
0307388840|2.0|. . . Couldn't really get into it after watching the movie, but actually managed to finish it this time. Would I read another book of Ian McEwan's? Not unless he changed his writing style drastically.<br /><br />At first the book is hard to get into, because it flicks back and forth between the different characters' points of views. But then the film is the same. But the book is pages and pages of never ending description - with very little dialogue added in between. And when you do get dialogue, it seems to be all grouped together, before you get more pages and pages of description.<br /><br />What I will say about the book is that the film was at least faithful to it. You know I hate watching movies of books that I loved (the recent Narnia movies being prime examples), but reading the book after watching the film, I saw a few more insights into what I liked in the movie, but didn't quite make sense.<br /><br />What I will NEVER get about the movie or the book for that matter, is the whole Lola/Paul Marshall storyline. What girl marries the man who sexually abused her? Or was it consensual? Considering she looked like she was crying the second time at least, we can think it wasn't consensual? I found this whole storyline very difficult to understand, since she marries Paul in both the movie and the book.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is also changed, and to be honest, I preferred the ending depicted in the movie. The ending in the book just didn't work. I'm not quite sure what it was, but I was still turning pages, trying to find the rest of it.<br /><br />If I'm going to be brutally honest, I skimmed a lot of sections of this book. I still read it, but particularly the war section of the book (scenes I hated in the movie) I skimmed. I was certainly disappointed even more than I was first time around, and would only recommend it to readers of Ian McEwan's work. Certainly do not read as your first book.
0375826726|3.0|This is probably the best written book of this series, but it is really slow moving and predictable.  I don't know how many more descriptions of elvish customs and delights I can handle.  I was expecting this book to be action packed, which it wasn't.  I was expecting the series to end, which it didn't. And I keep waiting for the foreshadowed epic romance between Eragon and Arya to begin, but it still hasn't advanced beyond an unrequited crush.    On the plus side, this book does a better job developing the character of Eragon than the other two.

0749399570|3.0|Amy Tan's novel has much to offer the reader in search of a Chinese American family story.  There is nothing mundane or ordinary about the stories of familial friends whose lives are woven together. Each family years to pass down their history, particularly the mothers to their daughters. And that is what makes this novel so special.  The history of each family belongs to the women of the novel and it is their duty to pass down this knowledge to their daughters. But the daughters are not so receptive as the mothers hope them to be.     The daughters do not embrace this knowledge as the mothers hope but instead turn away from their Chinese heritage.  The daughters attempt to assimilate but as they do hurt their mothers who hold their cultural traditions dear to their heart.    And what exactly does mean?  The daughters are expected to live up to their parents expectations and their cultural traditions.  From mother to daughter, each woman has her own special way of understanding and uplifting that which is important in her family such as cultural obligations and duties.    The women of the family pass down what is dear from mother to daughter but the stories are never completely told and just an inkling of understanding is left for the reader.  That is what makes their life stories, tragic and loving, so important.  It is the mother's duty to tell story and to pass down her history.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Metallica released a potentially excellent album here. If you are a fan you'd probably die for the new tracks - they are great. However, they made a big mistake releasing this album EQ'd into a horrible distorted mess. I mean, what a tragedy! It sucks to listen to this album. If you want the same effect, turn your TV onto snow-channel and volume up to 10 - then play Justice on your boombox at the same time.    Is this a trick to get us to all buy the album twice - after they fix it. Call it payback for using Napster.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|My fellow reviewer Scott was spot on with his review... The kings are just a shadow of their former selves. Please make welcome the Queens of Leon. After hearing the song 'crawl' i had such high hopes for this. Instead, I get this rather boring album that sounds like a bad 42 minute exercise in 'hey, check out my reverb'. It sounds like this mess was written after an all night 'd&m' with Bono. This bands sound was once solidly rooted in southern rock and beer soaked whiskey swing. Now we have to listen to this tedious rubbish. Bin it!

B000N4SHPS|5.0|What exactly is age, aside from a number?    For far too long, I have read so many endless attacks against Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone simply because they both dared to revisit characters they immortalized in the 1980s. I will never again lend a second's credence to such shameless nitpicking. Sylvester Stallone may very well be a sixty year old man, but he pulled off \\"Rocky Balboa\\" in a profoundly moving and realistic manner and subsequently transformed this prior skeptic into a BIG-TIME believer. This, far and beyond any reasonable contention, is the true and respectful swan song the \\"Rocky\\" saga has long deserved.    Wisely ignoring the unsightly plot points that were introduced in \\"Rocky V,\\" this more recent story unfolds with a highly publicized \\"virtual boxing\\" match that pits the long-retired Rocky against current heavyweight titleholder Mason Dixon. When Rocky scores the duke in this particular fantasy bout, Dixon retaliates by challenging Balboa to a one-on-one publicly televised 10-round exhibition. Everybody, including Rocky's own son, steadfastly dismisses the idea. But Rocky, who has always ever worked best when the odds were stacked against him, agrees to face Dixon. What ensues, amidst the rudimentary training regimen we've all seen Rocky endure throughout the five previous films, is a staggeringly heartfelt and engaging character study that very nearly rivals that which was introduced in John Avildsen's groundbreaking 1976 original.    Among the most notable are some admittedly touching moments with Rocky and Paulie as they revisit the Italian Stallion's love for Adrian who, as many prior reviewers here have already noted, is no longer part of the narrative fold. These scenes, along with a certain pep-talk Rocky gives his defiantly selfish son at the film's halfway mark, really helped sell the story's realism. Stallone made me genuinely feel for these people, a feat that I and many others had previously doubted he was capable of achieving. His screenplay very literally came out of left field and opened my eyes to the plain and simple fact that he still has what it takes. There was not a single point throughout the entire film where I was deliberately thinking about his age. A person's age, as I've already alluded to, should never be a consideration. You're as young as you feel and, if you happen to be in the phenomenal shape Stallone is in for a man of his years, I say more power to ya'!    There really isn't anything more to be said. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is a more than worthy addition to this extraordinary series of motion pictures. You would be hard pressed to find another film more deserving of a purchase. Make no mistake when I say, it delivers a definitive knockout!
0132350882|5.0|When you do code maintenance, you can really \\"love\\" or \\"hate\\" a person that you do not even know just by the code he or she has written. Messy code almost always goes hand in hand with lower productivity, lower motivation, and a higher number of bugs. In the first chapter, Robert C. Martin presents in a very instructive way, the opinion from very well-known personalities about what \\"clean code\\" is, and also suggests we apply the Boy Scout Rule (Leave the campground cleaner that you found it) to our code. The following chapters present practical advice about how to do this cleaning (or even better, how to avoid the mess in the first place).<br /><br />The suggestions presented in the book (meaningful names, pertinence of comments, code formatting, etc) may sound very familiar to any experienced programmer but they are presented with such a level of detail and with very illustrative examples that it is almost impossible not to learn valuable things chapter by chapter. All the examples are in Java, but the guidelines they illustrate can be applied, in most of the cases, to other languages.<br /><br />The most challenging chapter to read (but also a very valuable one) was the Refactoring of the class SerialDate (from the JCommon library). It is a real-life example and the author shows step-by-step what it takes to do refactoring. The last chapter, \\"Smells and Heuristics\\" makes a very good closure presenting in categories and in a condensed way, potential problems and suggested ways to solve/mitigate them.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book and after finishing it, I decided to apply the Boy Scout Rule. I took a module written in a procedural language and not only managed to improve the clarity of the code, but also reduced the number of lines from more than 1,100 to 650. The next person to touch this code will certainly be happy to deal with cleaner code!
B00005JMCT|4.0|I loved the other two films, read bad reviews, and put off seeing this one for a while. Just shows you can't trust critics. I think this film had the most laugh-out-loud funny moments of the series (I don't see many films where people keep going for minutes, there are two scenes which involve dogs...well, you just have to see the film).  The characters, for the most part, are rounded out beautifully (a few aren't given enough to do). Sean William Scott's \\"Stifler\\" will go down in movie history. Kudos also to Biggs, Hannigan, Thomas, and Levy, who add subtle shades to characters we've come to know.  The biggest surprise for me is that this wasn't a sloppy sequel (um, unless you mean messiness, like the scene where...see the movie). The opening scene in the restaurant, to me, was the funniest moment of the whole series.

0765348276|4.0|I'm fascinated by tales of transhumanism. Old Man's War is a novel concept that takes us to places we might find if we develop the technology to move the contents of a human mind around into various bodies. It's also much, much more.<br /><br />Scalzi's writing style is palatable. His plot devices worked for me. I found his characters interesting. It's a big universe out there, and Scalzi shows us what he imagines it might be like for humanity if we can ever move off our home planet.<br /><br />Military elements in Old Man's War are well crafted and plausible. I found the book to be hard to put down, which becomes rarer and rarer as I age.
1843106698|5.0|As, a teacher, I was afraid that the proliferation of titles dealing with Asperger's Syndrome was the \\"flavour of the month\\", but Tony Attwood gives a full and detailed explanation of the origins of the research and why we are only just hearing about this syndrome. The best part is that after reading this book, I have started to look at some of my \\"problem\\" students in a completely new way. Attwood not only explains why they are the way they are, but also gives expert advice about how to best cope with children (and adults) who are not easy to cope with. I say this last sentence deliberately, as Attwood points out that we must cope with them, as they are the way they are and they do not change. The condition is genetic, lifelong and stable. The book is a treasure trove of information and helpful ideas.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Here's a review from an average guy...maybe below average in regard to photography.  I have owned a Nikon D50 for about a year.  I primarily shoot in Auto, but make small jumps into manual-land.  My problem is that I do not have time to experiment with family, work, etc.    At any rate, I just got the SB400.  After reading Ken Rockwell rave about bouncing the old flash, I had to give it a try.  Needless to say, he was spot on.  Bounced flash gets rid of the shine and glare that direct flash can give you.  It allows for a natural, evenly distributed amount of light in the picture--which hugely reduces shadows.    Even a total novice like me (but an enthusiastic novice!) can appreciate this added dimension to my pics.  I think, if I am reading the specs correctly, I am getting double the range of my D50's pop-up.  You can also realize the potential of your fps...it is a \\"speedlight\\" and this flash can keep up with my camera.    All in all, a superb purchase for the price.  BUT...read all the specs on this little guy before buying.  Make sure it does what you are looking for.  I won't be \\"commanding\\" a bunch of these flashes, or rotating it to the side, or shooting from 150 feet away, so this was all I needed.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Let me be very fair by stating that this film is beautifully recreated in Blu-Ray with all the special effects and sound seemingly amplified! It's a beauty!<br /><br />However, the fourth installment of \\"Indiana Jones\\" is a disappointment. The entrance scene with Indiana and his fedora in a silhouette is a nice start, but the film's plot quickly disintegrates into implausibility. Now, I do understand the Saturday `Flash Gordon' type stories where credibility is stretched for entertainment, but this film stretches and breaks. Marion is back (Karen Allen) and her entrance is so very welcome, but she soon disappears into a one-dimensional character. Indiana's new side-kick (Shia LaBeouf) misses his mark and only annoys when constantly slicking back his hair (thanks to George Lucas). John Hurt is such a great actor, it hurts to see him delegated to barely speaking, but his face tells a lot more than the dialogue around him. Cate Blanchett is thoroughly believable as the commie villain, but her character is also `dumbed-down'.<br /><br />The action scenes are not as inventive as previous Indiana Jones films (remember the first 15 minutes of \\"Temple of Doom\\" from the dance number, \\"Anything Goes\\" to jumping out a three-story building to a car chase to jumping out of a plane in a raft to sliding down a snow peaked glacier to dropping off a cliff into a wild raging river and on and on...?) There is nothing like that here. There is a floating car with our heroes that goes over numerous gigantic waterfalls and no one gets hurt (only a little wet). The car chase scene on the cliff never gets too exciting and to see LaBeouf swinging on vines ala Tarzan is just TOO much to have the audience believe. Do I need to add the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator that is blown a mile away? And finally, I apologize, but the \\"Close Encounters\\" ending is fairly dramatic, but with all that torrential water gushing, mountains collapsing and the winds hurling around the characters, why don't their clothes or hair move at all? It is the most egregious CGI overlook since George Lucas (\\"Return Of The Jedi\\") had Mark Hamill fly through the redwood forest on the air-scooters and the ferns didn't move at all.<br /><br />Like I said, I tried to be fair. It is still a great film compared to most that is out there. But when Lucas and Spielberg set the bar SO high with previous works, they can't top themselves and that hurts - kind of like growing up and realizing your heroes are really ordinary people.

B0017KP93U|5.0|I am frequently a late comer to what is hip and cool. I had listened to Radiohead early on (Kid A, the Bends, Pablo Honey) but just didn't get it. In a twisted way I returned to Radiohead after my new found appreciation of groups like Coldplay, Muse, Keane, and the like. This Best of CD may not be all their best music but it is extensive and awesome. I couldn't stop listening to disc one with many of the familiar tunes but eventually found may way into disc two which is just as excellent in its own right. Songs like Let Down and Planet Telex really hold their own, even if they may not be their better known material.    Listening to Radiohead is a unique experience, and the critics were right about this group early on. I remember hearing an interview with Tony Banks from Genesis (one of my musical heroes), and he was asked who he liked in the modern musical scene. His first reply was Radiohead. I tucked that away in the recesses of my cerebrum until I finally \\"got it\\" about Radiohead. I can best describe them as a mixture of U2 and Beck. There is clearly the musical talent and the VOICE of Bellamy but there is also a distinctive push into a new style/genre of rock music that sets Radiohead apart.     If you haven't quite gotten into Radiohead, I highly recommend this collection. It has opened my ears to a group that has changed the direction of much of what we here today.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|WOW what a bad looking print. Who the heck was in charge of this Blu-Ray transfer??? Does the 'Ray' stand for Ray Charles? because it looks as if a blind man choose to use this print! All the fuzzies, dots, lines, and blemishes on this print look ever better in hi-def! Why on earth can't the original negative be used? If I'm gonna pay a higher price, then I should get a much better picture. Shame, shame, shame, on them.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Oh, where to begin... Metallica's first album, \\"Kill 'EM All\\" came out in 1983... Just kidding. This album is what I see as a return to classic Metallica. Heavier than \\"Metallica\\" but not quite as heavy as \\"...And Justice For All.\\" To their credit, it doesn't really sound like either of these. They've taken their classic formula and wrote songs today. If you wish to call it a rip-off of themselves you'd still be wrong, because the excellent songwriting won't let you forget it IS Metallica. The production is infinitely better than \\"St. Anger's,\\" no crappy guitar tones, drum sound, and bad voice work, everything's improved. There's even bass parts you can hear! There's a bass and drum only part (albeit brief) on \\"Cyanide\\" and on \\"Suicide & Redemption,\\" imagine that. If you were a fan of \\"Load\\" & \\"Reload\\" only, you're almost guaranteed not to like this album. Side note: I've never actually met anyone who even really likes those albums period, so just a heads up.     SONGS: The lead single, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" is a great song, which is likely to be compared to 'One' because of its melodic beginnings and heavy ending; while the other melodic song 'The Unforgiven III,' is also a really good song that really shows off Hetfields ability to still sing (though maybe not as well as the first Unforgiven). There's an interesting instrumental, another feature of the \\"classic\\" albums, titled 'Suicide & Redemption,' that features some very catchy guitar work. 'The End of the Line,' 'Broken, Beat and Scarred,' and 'Cyanide,' are a part of a familiar yet new Metallica sound, which is undeniably metal.. and catchy. 'That Was Just Your Life,' 'All Nightmare Long', and 'My Apocalypse' should satisfy any fan of '80's Metallica, and just so happen to be my three favorites. I must emphasize how incredible 'All Nightmare Long' is, it's their best song in 17 years.    Tracks you need: All Nightmare Long, My Apocalypse
0141439688|5.0|I have to admit I am a Jane Austen addict.  I just can't help but enjoy her witty dialog set in old English times.  Sometimes I wish we talked more like they did.  I feel like she just takes me back to a time long past, but very much alive and rich.  This is the fourth book I have read of hers, and I loved it just as much as the others.  I highly recommend reading it.

0375826726|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I found myself reading the last few pages wondering at the new writing techniques the author used.  Of course I like the story, it's why I bought the book.  But was used to be a fanciful tale, full of action, that sucked a reader in has become *sorry fans* boring.  What used to be dense, concise writing, has become so descriptively fluffy that it is distracting to this reader.  I won't be buying future hardcovers from this author, paperbacks maybe...maybe.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This album is one of Sabbath's best but is often overshadowed by their other albums. I think Ozzy's voice is at his best on this one and it is chock full of great riffing by Iommi. All the tunes are great, but my favorite is \\"Symptom of the Universe\\",  a powerful tritone based metal riff with a bizarre jazz/blues acoustic outro.  The album really is full of surprises; tempo changes, key changes, acoustic guitars dropping in out of nowhere, a choir, synthesizers. Definitely underrated.
B001B71NOI|5.0|I'm one of those who are true fans of Nine Inch Nails.  I collect their albums since 1992's EP \\"Broken\\" until the latest 2008's \\"The Slip\\".  For the audio CD, Trent Reznor still performs his brilliant skills on composing this record.  The mood of this album starts with dim and mysterious atmosphere on \\"999,999\\" by letting the synthesized sounds treat your emotion.  Then, the real show commences with the songs \\"1,000,000\\" with the heavy beating drums' line and heavy distortion guitar.  Some of you may feel that this song sounds like \\"March of the Pigs\\" from their 1994 album \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  The mood continues with \\"Letting You\\", \\"Discipline\\", \\"Echoplex\\" (one of my favorite tracks on this record), and \\"Head Down\\" (my another favorite track).  Since your mood climb up to the highest point, it will descend down to the calmest emotion when you listen to the tracks \\"Lights in the Sky\\", \\"Corona Radiata\\", and \\"The Four of Us Are Dying\\".  Finally, just finish the show of Slip with the song \\"Demon Seed\\" by listening to their heavy-distortion guitar and heavy drums.  For the limited edition, the rehearsal performance DVD of 5 songs are in really good quality and high resolution (1,000,000, \\"Letting You\\", \\"Discipline\\", \\"Echoplex\\", and \\"Head Down\\").    If you are looking for electronic-rock band, Nine Inch Nails is definitely recommended.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|The first time I sat down to watch 'Some Kind of Monster' hoping to discover what in Gods name the band was thinking when they wrote `St. Anger', I wanted to cry. The Gods of 80's Thrash Metal had been reduced to a bunch of whiny, snotty, children who somehow forgot who they were.<br /><br />Thankfully, with a new producer and a revamped sound, those days are behind... and may they remain hidden in the darkness from which they came.<br />`Death Magnetic' is such a glorious triumph for the band that its difficult to know how to describe it best. The sounds are throw backs to `Ride the Lightning' and `Master of Puppets' with a very new, yet heavy twist. The songs are very well constructed with tons of riffs that flow smoothly from one idea to the next without feeling to bogged down or busy.<br /><br />No question every Metallica fan should check this one out and crank it very loudly!
0618680004|5.0|An Excellent Book!! Whether or not you agree with Mr. Dawkins, this book is a must-read!!
B000UFAURI|3.0|I was not super impressed with ESPG being a long time FF fan. The fighters showcase a wide range of styles ranging from slow ballads to faster paced rock/grunge sounds but as a whole, the album does not flow well and is difficult to listen to from start to finish. The first single 'The Pretender' is my least favorite after hearing the complete album and listeners may be mislead after listening to that track.<br /><br />Its worthwhile to long time FF fans, but if this is your first fighters album, look to the early 90's albums instead. This one is just mediocre.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|So many times on Amazon I look for a review of the PRODUCT, and end up getting a review of the movie/documentary/story etc.  So I will attempt to review the PRODUCT (blu-ray vs standard) rather than Planet Earth itself.    I bought the standard DVD format after seeing a few episodes on Discovery, and before I managed to get my blu-ray setup.  I was thoroughly engrossed, the visuals, the quality, the information, and the narration by David Attenborough on this standard DVD were superb.  Absolutely no complaints on this format.    Got my blu-ray setup, and this was the first product on my list (I actually bought the entire BBC collection which included Galapagos, Wild China, Ganges).  Quality was as I expected of blu-ray, really brought out the images as 1080p would.    Major flaw on the blu-ray version however - the last disc of the standard DVD is not included, exactly why, I have been unable to find a reason.  This disc contained some valuable extras, including a great segment on the state of the planet right now, and some compelling examples and visuals of our human impact on many locations around the globe.    My feelings towards this product are consequently mixed.  There is no arguing the superiority of blu-ray vs regular DVD.  However, Planet Earth was so spectacularly done, that looking at the images on the standard DVD format are still fantastic.    If this blu-ray version had all the discs included, I would recommend it hands-down ahead of the regular.  If you are willing to surcumb to the marketing strategies (or whatever was the reason) of BBC and pay for both versions (as I ended up doing), then you're set.  However, if you are looking to buy just 1 version, I personally think that the extra disc, partnered with the already magnificent quality of the standard DVD, puts it ahead of the blu-ray package offered.
031606792X|3.0|After reading some of the low rated reviews, I agree with them.  I LOVED the first three books, and the fourth was a real let-down!    SPOILERS!    Pros: Once again, Meyer brings her world to life, and her characters really can breathe right off the page with personality and description.  My favorites are Jasper, Alice, Jacob and Emmett. I absolutely loved how she went back to Jacob's POV again; the humor was a real relief, and it made me love the wereworlf even more.  I just HATE how its love Edward this or hate Jacob that...grow up already!!!  I loved how she describes becoming a vampire, and the terror of the delivery.  The wedding was well written too, especially because Alice did it! ^^  Also, I loved how in the end, it showed some happy endings for Charlie and other characters...    Cons: Okay, here we go... I don't think this was the ending for the fans at all! I did like Bella DID become strong and angry once she was a vampire, but like someone said, Bella shouldn't get everything!  I WANTED the confrontation with the Volutri to happen because it shows the contention between them, and if some actually died, it really shows the sacrifice Edward and Bella made, it would make it more human and logical.  Also, I HATED HATED how they get a child! Come on, even though us teens aren't parents yet, this is the ending for the author ONLY!  I pictured that either they died like Romeo and Juliet, or lived through a tough battle and real grief for those who died.  I do, also, find it creepy that Jacob imprints on the baby! Sometimes, I really wanted Bella to really consider being with Jacob, like she'd sorta done in NEW MOON, before being stupid and only sticking with Edward, and drowning out everything else...  Plus, I think Charlie and Renee should've had a bit more involvement in Bella being a vampire.  I personally think she was selfish leaving her life behind for someone who literally couldn't wait for her.    Despite everything I hated, I finished it and got someclosure.  I do love her writing, and how her mind works when she writes, but like I said, this was the weakest one (being the worst). The original is the best one of the four, though I'm not particularly excited for the film.  I STRONGLY recommend THE HOST to get Breaking Dawn out of your system; along with Meyer, I think its her best written work.  I do love Bella and Edward and Jacob, but it has serious flaws that should've been fixed right.
B00005JPO1|4.0|This is a worthy entry into the Indiana Jones canon, though (lynch me for saying it, but it's the truth) it is a little disappointing. The action is fun and there is plenty of humor. It isn't as dark as the black sheep in the series: The Temple of Doom. However, it doesn't feel quite like a true Indy movie. Without giving anything away, (but you do get this feel fairly early on anyway) it's much more Sci-Fi than the previous Indy movies have been. The original trilogy was all about mystical objects that had magical or theological powers. Here it isn't so much magic as science.<br /><br />And before you call foul, the legend of the skulls is a real one and this movie took one of the theories surrounding the skulls and brought it to life, so it was more than sci-fi sensationalism. However, it still didn't quite ring true to Indy's repertoire.

She can pull off any note. Can't wait to but this! I love \\"On the Line\\" with the Jonas Brothers. I checked it out on iTunes this morning. I think it's a great song. \\"Until You're Mine\\" is a great song, too.    Vote for Nick 2038!  Jules
965006026X|1.0|This book is a lesson in garbage in, garbage out. Keynes starts with numerous false assumptions, and follows them to their false conclusions. Keynes has been proven wrong time and again, not only through the texts of much better economic writers (Hayek, Rothbard, Mises), but also through the plain facts of history.     Keynes' book reads like through the looking glass, where down is up, and everyone is drunk at a mad tea party. Keynes' ideas are precisely what will (and already have) lead society to economic failure and misery. The current financial crisis is only the latest in examples of why Keynes was wrong.
B000002UAX|5.0|Many younger listeners prefer THE WHITE ALBUM above all other Beatles albums.  Above even the gold standard of Sgt. Pepper and the highly beloved Abbey Road.  I don't share this enthusiasm.  I place the afore mentioned Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road in the top two followed by Revolver and Rubber Soul.  Rounding out the top five would be the unjustly neglected Magical Mystery Tour.  THE WHITE ALBUM would then come in sixth.<br /><br />The Beatles never made a bad album.  LET IT BE may be the lone exception--a failure so curious that it is difficult to merely tag it as \\"bad\\".  (So \\"bad\\" it's good in a peculiar sort of way.).<br /><br />Coming after the psychedelic period, THE WHITE ALBUM is a surprisingly dark album--the previous focus of peace and love is missing here.  The record anticipated the stripped down production and \\"confessional\\" songwriting found in prevalence during the early 1970's.  While this was a welcome development for some, THE WHITE ALBUM was something of a let down initially.  Most buyers were disappointed in the absence of the *Hey Jude/Revolution*.  The Beatles had a preference for not putting their singles on the albums; but in this case it this was a significant error.<br /><br />Like most double albums, this one could easily been paired down to a single disc.  Many of the cuts are frivolous while others bog things down. Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B sides.  Still many critics acclaim THE WHITE ALBUM as a celebrated explosion of musicianship in which the Beatles demonstrated that they could play in number of styles--as if such a demonstration was necessary.  Still, many listeners like the album precisely because it is so varied.<br /><br />Whatever else could be said, the wide variety of styles signaled a foreboding and desperation.  With the exception of the first side, each song is distant and isolated from all the others.  There is a sense of fragmentation and disassociation on THE WHITE ALBUM not found on any of the Beatles previous records.  Indeed, now that we know some of the history behind the scenes, it can be seen that The Beatles were fracturing.  In retrospect, without the glue of Brian Epstein, their recently deceased manager, each band member was spinning of into separate directions.  The Beatles, particularly Lennon and McCartney, had in the past bounced off each other to good effect-- jolting each from their own element..  Collaboration was deteriorating and along side many flashes of brilliance weaker musical instincts slithered in.<br /><br />Only side one hangs together in the flow of tracks to form a \\"whole\\" which is both pleasing and memorable.  Three great songs, even the lesser songs stick with you, fun, humorous and recklessly inventive -and it absolutely rocks.  The three remaining sides of the original LP version suffer in comparison.<br /><br />Side one opens with a great coupling in Back in the USSR and Dear Prudence.  Parody is a much overused word--too often meaning a barb thrown at others.  In fact the Beatles frequently paid homage to the music they loved from other musicians.  *Back In The USSR* is no more a parody of the Beach Boys or Elvis (both of whom McCartney loved) than *Got To Get You Into My Life* was of Motown.  This is seamlessly followed by Dear Prudence which sounds better with each listening and is far more complex as a song than it seems.  The rest is pleasant enough and one song follows another in sharp focus.  But the room stops still with *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*.  Harrison's *Guitar* towers over the rest of the album and is the one song that immediately jumps to mind in any discussion of THE WHITE ALBUM. McCartney and Lennon are like the older brother turning out excellent work.  But Harrison is like the little brother who pops out of nowhere with a piece of work that blows the daylights off the competition.  The acoustic version found in the Anthology series reveals it is actually a simple song that lends itself to a relaxed and tender presentation.  But here it is played with vehemence with the guest guitar solo by Eric Clapton. The Beatles loved silly songs for their own sake.  Yet here, following the failure of the age of peace and love to appear, lyrics of unvarnished grief are put on full display.<br /><br />Side Two does not hang together well and most tend to pick their favorites to listen to rather than the entire side.  *I'm So Tired* is a Lennon downer that ruins this side for me.  Much better is *Rocky Raccoon*--a McCartney nonsense song.  *I Will* is a lovely McCartney romance that remains an unjustly neglected song by even McCartney's diehard fans.  Lennon's *Julia* is one of the sweetest songs he ever wrote--infuriately used as a bit of psychoanalysis into his soul by his biographers (Julia was his mother's name).<br /><br />Side three was a favorite of early FM rock radio.  *Birthday* just rocks.  *Me and My Monkey* is joyous, free flying a rocker and truly funny.  *Helter Skelter* is one tough hard rocker which some claim is a precursor to heavy metal.  *Long Long Long* anticipates much of ALL THING MUST PASS and the rest Harrison's output in the 1970's.  However, here THE WHITE ALBUM really needs a kickass rocker--perhaps Lennon's *Bulldog* or a reworking of Harrison's own *It's All Too Much* (both found on the YELLOW Submarine soundtrack).<br /><br />Side four is a disappointment.  The version of *Revolution* appearing here has its own charm but in the context of the album is slow, plodding, and understated where the excitement and full blast rock and roll of the original is needed.  John Lennon later claimed that he preferred the slower version--but like many things he said in the 1970's he was just plain wrong.  Harrison's big band *Savoy Truffle* is quite good.<br /><br />In view of what was to come after the Beatles broke up, it is interesting to note that the styles of music we now associate with each Beatle are pretty much here.  If you separate and group each song according to its author, we find the spiritual and sometimes sarcastic George, the gentle and good hearted Ringo, the acidic yet sometimes sentimental John, and the entertainer Paul with one foot in rock and roll and the other foot in the old English music hall.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, John's contributions are not his best.  *Yer Blues* is a desolate and pointless barb aimed at the British blues revival.  Revolution #1 had none of the exhilaration of the original.  *Sexy Sadie* is just plain tedious.  *I'm So Tired* makes one uncomfortable and not in a good way.  On the other hand, contrary to his common image, THE WHITE ALBUM contains two of Lennon's sweetest and charming compositions:  *Dear Prudence* and *Julie*.  It is tempting to search *REV # 9* for a deep meaning in the chaos--there is none there.  It is only a cut and paste job of various sounds and spoken word.  George Martin hated it and opposed its inclusion.  It sucks the air out of the room.  It would have been much better if *Hey Jude* took its place.<br /><br />Absent the earlier psychedelic wash, much of McCartney's work remains charming but devoid of \\"cosmic significance\\".  This is not to say that much of his contributions to THE WHITE ALBUM aren't truly great.  It is just that he has a penchant to write very minor work.  As much as many complain of the deteriorating quality of McCartney's work in the 1970's, the truth is it is all found here.<br /><br />Harrison hits two out of four with *My Guitar* and *Savoy Truffle* --making one wish that he caught the fire again in his later work.  Ringo Starr remains the \\"gentle giant\\" who is more fun than musically significant.<br /><br />Perhaps one's opinion of THE WHITE ALBUM depends on how one views psychedelic music.  If you have an innate understand of the multi-layered, slightly touched noise, THE WHITE ALBUM is a step down.  If you feel that it is rubbish, THE WHITE ALBUM is a revelation.  What is clear is that theBeatles largely began the psychedelic era and then ended it after a few years.  Just compare the chronology of the Beatles and the Stones and you'll get a hint of others following in the Beatles wake.  THE WHITE ALBUM is dark, yes.

B001AR0D4A|4.0|Since I am a big fan of John Carpenter (who is given homage at the beginning of the character has a painting of \\"The Thing\\" poster), I was excited to give this a rent a few months ago, and ultimately add the Blu-Ray to my collection.<br /><br />There are of course similarities to such old school movies as \\"The Fog\\" and \\"The Birds\\" (the scene where Marcia Gay Harden starts her religious rant, definitely must have been a tribute to the scene in \\"The Birds\\" where Melanie Daniels slaps the other woman to come to her senses).<br /><br />The plot itself is borrowed from many other movies, where government experiments are to be faulted for outbreaks, plagues, irresponsible human testing etc etc etc, but the overall story, of being trapped in that situation, and not being able to go more than 30 ft, without getting devoured by the unseen-well that never gets old!<br /><br />I favored the Black and White version, because the colors and shadows were more pronounced, but both versions were a fun ride. I had hoped for a different ending, where everone does not get shot, but I have to admit, it added extra terror and sympathy for the lead character. I enjoyed the scene where the big creature crosses in front of the car. I realize the CGI was not touted to be particularly advanced but that scene actually had an existential feel to it. The combination of the creature's sounds and the awe at its might, was effective.<br /><br />Overall the acting was very exaggerated, but I wonder if the film makers didn't intend it be a little tongue in cheek. I'll need to watch the extras to find out. PQ/AQ 4/5, as the picture was a little soft in parts,and the sound not quite as powerful as I thought.<br /><br />This movie is a good time, and worthwhile for fans of the genre!
B00000K3D4|2.0|This is pure 1986, as both the dated David Bowie soundtrack and the primitive special effects will reveal. The story line is simple, and there are no scary parts. Good for kids, I guess. I never saw this when it came out. It seems to appeal mostly to people who were growing up in the 80s. If you didn't, you might skip this.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Freaks is a film that is entertaining and disturbing. As a matter of fact, it is just so very disturbing that it was banned for many years. When first released, the studio cut almost half an hour from it because it so disturbed audiences of the day. Freaks was directed by Tod Browning, who also is responsible for Bela Lugosi's Dracula.<br /><br />Somehow this film was rediscovered by the counterculture and it became a favorite at midnight shows. If you were in college at the time, you've probably seen this film. Perhaps the theme of  beauty not being what \\"the establishment\\" perceives it to be spoke to that generation. How disturbing is it to find that the real evil is in what seems the most attractive to us?<br /><br />Set in a carnival populated by society's outcasts, the story's soap-opera theme is acted out by non-professionals who are, indeed, deformed in some way. That's why Freaks is so unique. Don't look for actors transformed by Hollywood make-up.<br /><br />This DVD is not recommended for everyone. But if you are interested in seeing an amazing film that is made even more shocking by the times that produced it, Freaks should not be missed.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|An epic disaster. Bad acting. Poorly sung. The cast are all acting in different movies. Get the Disney tv version which is superior to this film in every way.
B000005S5N|5.0|I picked this album up when it was fresh and new.  By then, A-ha's star was somewhat already on the fade in rural Texas.  Take on Me had never been especially well loved by my country music appreciating neighbors, but Hunting High and Low practically didn't leave my tape deck (!) for a year.  So when Scoundrel Days came out, I saved my money and bought it as soon as I could.  I was enchanted.  Morten's voice, which was my main attraction to A-ha, had never sounded better.  Manhattan Skyline was an immediate standout to me, and I still love its passionate chorus of \\"I don't want to cry again...\\".  But now, some 20 years later, I still love this album.  The music shows surprising depth of focus for a synth driven boy band, and proves what the musical world now knows--that these guys were never just a boy band.  The music ranges from pop gems (Maybe Maybe)to passionate numbers like Scoundrel Days.  I'd love to let them rework \\"Cry Wolf\\" into something less bubble-gummy, but I guess they were under pressure from their label to have another poppy hit.  It is good, but not as great as some of their other less commercial stuff.  All in all, this is the go-to A-ha album for me, although I own all the rest and regularly listen to them as well. In the end, Morten's voice is simply not to be believed, and both Pal and Mags are unsung heroes of pop-music.  This is a seminal record for the era, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciated 80's music as one of the great underappreciated discs.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I used to own the vinyl LP of this album, later the CD, then it was stolen. I must replace it. I saw a concert of John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra back in 1975 when \\"Visions of the Emerald Beyond\\" was just released. Jeff Beck was the warm-up act (ha!). At the end of the concert both guitarists jammed for a half-hour together and blew us all away. I think that collaboration rubbed off on both of them for subsequent albums. What a night!
B0017ASV1C|2.0|So, going into Righteous Kill last night, I knew who the killer was.  It wasn't that I've read spoilers or knew much of anything about the plot, except for what was shown in the trailers.  But it just seemed so obvious and I didn't expect the movie to be anything more than what I thought it was; i.e. needless.  However, watching the movie, I started thinking...hmmm, maybe the movie is smarter than I expected.  Maybe it won't be the most obvious person in the room and maybe they are actually trying to do something interesti--oh.  Nope.  It's who I originally thought it would be.  Bummer.    I guess I shouldn't have expected much out of the director who did 88 Minutes, but I was hoping it would be something surprising.  The beginning was certainly interesting; it caught my attention and had me going for a bit.  Unfortunately, as the film progressed, I started wishing it was over just so I could find out who the killer was.  Nothing that was happening was terribly interesting or insightful.      Most of the movie was about building a case against one of the characters and that's it; there's no real red herrings and you could probably piece together who's doing it rather quickly so that the \\"plot twist,\\" which might have been hip back in the early 90s or late 80s, is anything but. If you already know that the only possible suspect isn't the killer and the movie doesn't even pursue any other red herrings, then you have a boring film.  The only reason to go see this, as the trailer seems intent on letting you know, is to see Pacino and De Niro acting together.  But really, is that enough to make someone sit through a boring film?  If you're that hard-up to see them acting together, go watch Heat again.      Very uneven.
B000002UAU|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out, but somehow it wandered, I think my younger sister has it and never returned it. I have recently been buying some of the earlier Beatles albums, and wanted to add this, so I could listen to it on headphones. Apparently George Martin was still only using 4 track recorders at this point, so what he achieved was pretty amazing. The album still sounds as good as ever. I have my favourite tracks but it's all good stuff. Listening to all the earlier Beatles albums reminds me how far they were ahead of the other bands at the time, especially with the quality of their original songs. I think only Brian Wilson was doing stuff as good or better than the Beatles/George Martin combination.
0783240236|4.0|First, let me say that Hitchcock's film, The Birds, was hailed as a brilliant film when it was first released, and it still is thought of as a masterpiece today.<br /><br />Hitchcock must have taken great pleasure in starting out with what seemed to be a light romantic film with amusing conflict among women for what seems to be a perfect man. But audiences are watching and waiting, knowing -- even from the title -- that there is something else much darker to come.<br /><br />To say that the tension builds slowly is an understatement, and the entire film is so understated in the building of tension that it is almost unbearable. Witness the scene outside the school, as Melanie waits for Cathy. Deep in thought, she smokes a cigarette as birds begin to land on the bars behind her. When she notices, finally, the fluttering of a bird, we see from her viewpoint that she suddenly notices all the birds that have assembled there. It's a sudden pivotal moment of awareness of birds as a source of fear.<br /><br />Birds is an excellent film. Just enjoy the ride.
B0011V7P0A|5.0|This CD is excellent! It certainly brings back fond memories. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are a true Rock and Roll band that you do not find in this day and age.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is one of the smartest people in the world!  His book is so amazing!  All his points are very well made and his logic is really awesome!  Everyone must read this book - atheists and believers alike! Best non-fiction book I've read in a long time!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I like Jason Statham.  Not all of his movies are great choices for him but this movie was a surprise. It was so good and didn't get a lot of press.  It is based on a true story that was kept quiet for many years. It's a British bank heist where most of the thieves knew little of what was actually the objective. I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  Just see it.
0439023483|5.0|My daughter loved the Gregor the Overlander books so I picked up an advanced copy of this book for her.  She is not an avid reader but finished it in a matter of several days.
B000GCFO0S|3.0|Film adaptations of video game franchises seem to take a lot of harsh criticism; right so, so most of them are cheesy and easily distinguishable as an attempt to make money off some dying game franchise, as opposed to an attempt to actually make a great movie that will be remembered for years to come.  Enter Silent Hill, a movie that takes a bit here and there from a couple of the Silent Hill games, then says \\"You know what?  Let's just make something good; something we can call our own.\\"    The film doesn't canonically follow the series.  The film resembles the original Silent Hill at its basic plot, but deviates in terms of characters and certain events.  This may be a good or bad thing for devoted Silent Hill fans; the story may be viewed as independent, or it may be frustratingly inaccurate.  Characters from later games also make brief appearances.    The visual effects in the film are great, Unfortunately, there's still a bit of noise/grain in the dark areas of the picture.  It's not necessarily distracting, just something I always look for, so I do end up noticing it.    The Blu-ray version doesn't come with any of the special features the regular DVD version comes with, which broke my heart.  I never watch any special features, but I feel entitled to them after paying nearly double for Blu-ray.  It's important to decide whether or not Blu-ray is important to you.  Is the scratch-resistance and larger format worth the price?  Unless your TV is 52\\" or larger, you won't need the larger format.    My recommendation would be to definitely get the movie, just not the Blu-ray version.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Steven King's novel depicting the trials of a bullied girl blossoming into womanhood while being victimized by a deranged mother is a masterpiece.<br /><br />At school, the misfit Carrie White is friendless. Her feminine beauty is invisible to her classmates, who view only her inability to meet the standards of adolescent society. At home, the harassment tears her soul apart. Her mother is a deluded, man-hating and sexually repressed sociopath who unleashes her repressed sexuality by sadistically inflicting punishment on her blossoming daughter in the name of \\"Jesus.\\"<br /><br />When Carrie, ignorant of the facts of life, experiences the onset of her period at school, the scene is set for the perfect storm in horror movie history. Carrie believes that she is dying. Her classmates, like the pack of animals that they are, sense blood and go on the attack. At home, it becomes yet another means for the sadist to humiliate her prey. The school is ultimately clueless as to how to address the issue, thereby providing the perfect battlefield for the Armageddon to come.<br /><br />Carrie is emotionally powerful horror film, an outstanding metaphor for the trauma of adolescent change, and no other film matches it's perfection.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Man....King Louie's music bit is the best. This movie is superb. Ahead of it's time.

0307165485|5.0|I have loved this book since before I was old enough to walk.  I bought this book to have a walk down memory lane and to remember my own road to literacy.  This book was instrumental in my learning to read.<br /><br />I recommend any Richard Scarry books to anyone with youngsters.  They contain wonderful stories and are very educational.
B00004RF83|5.0|Some of the best actors in Hollywood are in this film, but the best performance, as far as I am concerned is by Burt Lancaster.  When I read this book and saw the movie as a teenager, it scared me to death to think how easy it would have been to topple our government.  I would highly recommend this movie for any age range, with the caveat that reading the book first would enhance the experience.
0060007737|5.0|very easy to read, to the point...sometimes a little repetitive but that's ok...good for memorizing.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This film is a Wonderful Christmas film with some truly heart warming parts. One in particular is the scene where he signed with the little deaf girl in the store.<br /><br />I did not care too much for the court scene but I realize it was a take on the original and that is somewhat of a staple of the whole film.<br /><br />But all in all, I loved it!
B0016MJ6HY|2.0|What I like most about \\"My Blueberry Nights\\" is the great soundtrack album [[ASIN:B000RO9ZQE My Blueberry Nights]].  Wong Kar-Wai who won an award at Cannes for [[ASIN:B0002X7GZ2 Happy Together]] directed his first English language film.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well.  Jude Law is always interesting to watch for me.  His two Oscar nominations for \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" and \\"Cold Mountain\\" gave much better stories and characters than does this film.  Darius Khondji, the Oscar nominee for \\"Evita,\\" does stunning work with the cinematography.  However, time lapse photography of ice cream melting on a blueberry pie might make me hungry, but it doesn't compensate for the lack of a story.  Law's Jeremy and Norah Jones' Elizabeth seem like they are destined to become romantically linked.  After nights in the pie shop, Jones takes off which takes her to several locations.  Rachel Weisz who won a supporting Oscar & Golden Globe for \\"The Constant Gardener\\" plays the sleazy wife Sue Lynne to David Strathairn's boozy policeman.  I actually liked Strathairn more in this film than in his Oscar nominated performance for \\"Good Night & Good Luck\\"  He has such an unrequited love and such a tragic demise.  Down the road, Elizabeth runs into Natalie Portman's gambler character who seems juvenile, untrustworthy and spoiled.  However, Jones can't hold her own in frame with Portman and the film loses its path, as it seems to take a rabbit trail rather than illuminating the Elizabeth-Jeremy story.  Chan Marshall shows up as Jeremy's ex.  The big change in the movie comes as Jeremy tosses a jar of keys he'd been keeping at the diner.  While this film is handsomely filmed with good-looking talented actors and has a great soundtrack, it's rather awkward as a film, going nowhere slowly.  Taxi!
B000005GYI|5.0|Like pretty much every other reviewer on here, this album completely changed my my expectations for music. I'd say it's in my top 5 ever, and would even possibly make #1 if I had to choose. There's just a magic on here that is unmatched by anything else that I have heard. I think the influence of Lô Borges is quite heavy on here, because also on my top 5 would have to be his self titled album. Lô's early solo stuff is a little closer to the sound on Clube da Esquina than the rest of Milton's, but this is not saying in any way that his sound is not as good. Both are brilliant.   Minha vida é melhor agora porque de isso música! (hey I try)

B000VNMMR0|2.0|I was mildly entertained with this movie until it got to the part where the bad guy authorized a US Fighter Pilot to engage an attack on a Semi driven by our real American Hero, John McClane, on a busy Mix Master Highway. \\"Must kill that terrorist\\", RIGHT. So the Fighter Pilot is shooting missile after missile at Poor ole' John collapsing overpass after overpass killing hundreds of motorists. \\"Must kill that terrorist at all cost\\". That's still not enough. He pelts it with bullets, destroying even more of the overpass. So when the Jet becomes disabled, the pilot ejects allowing his jet to crash causing even more destruction. It angers me anytime our military are portrayed as stupid or a bunch of hillbillies. That's all I have to say about that.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|One of the best Robert Downey, Jr. movies.  He takes from personal experience being an alcoholic/druggy and it comes across a screen.  Really great story line.  Definitely a movie that will be around for a while.
B00005JM02|5.0|Since receiving this movie, my girls have watched it many times.  This is one of the few movies (The Lion King, The Never Ending Story, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story) that they will actually watch all the way through.  The story line is great, I particularly like the fact that Disney/Pixar finally included a positive father (Marlin the clownish).  In many Disney movies, the father is very mean, not around or dead and I think we need more positive roles of parents in movies for our children.
B000NA2776|5.0|I first heard the track \\"Lollipop\\" at work on a day when things were not going well, the song lifted up my whole day.  Later I looked up MIKA and listened to samples of other tracks.  This is usually the point where one discovers an album with one or two \\"good\\" tracks and a dozen filler tracks, not so here.  It got better and better the more I listened.  Musically, the sound does resemble Scissor Sisters, Queen, Harry Nilsson, even a bit of Chicago and Leo Sayer, which is fine because that sound worked in the 1970's and it works now.     The cover and insert art is based on work by both MIKA and his sister Yasmine (DaWack).  The comprehensive liner notes show that MIKA's sisters Zuleika and Paloma have sung backup on a couple of tracks, and that MIKA is unafraid to use novelties like spoon orchestras in his work.  Music critics either love MIKA or love to hate him as an artist, calling his work derivative, calling him a cynic, claim he is exploiting the Penniman family friend Raffa Kobeisi's story on a spoken word track on the CD, etc.  Forget about all of it, just go with the music, it's worth it.
B00005JPD0|3.0|I love movies about Time-Travel. This one was done fairly well with a plausible explanation. I had seen the trailer for this one but didn't find it alluring enough to fork over the $7 to see it at the movies or $5 to rent. I was fortunate enough to watch it for free on a STARZ free preview weekend. So for a free flick I give it 3 stars. Definitely worth it. Enjoy.

B00005NTJM|5.0|For eight bucks i was happy to have the convenience of updating my LP (although you can't have a favorite side anymore!) the remaster sounds pretty much the same as the album, the extra tracks appropriate, so unless you are a the obsessive collector or audiophile, perhaps this is the cd for your rather that the 40th anniversary reissue...
0385340990|5.0|I liked how this was written in letters.  It was a book that really held my interest.
B0000D8HDF|3.0|I will preface this by saying that I am not a Beethoven scholar and do not claim to be.  I am not incredibly familiar with Katsaris' other performances.    I'll start by saying that I am a fan of both Beethoven and Liszt, so I was anxious about finally hearing this rendition of the complete symphonies.  Liszt's transcription, and Katsaris' rendition, comes off as methodical and precise (just what you would expect from Liszt).  The \\"stand-out\\" performances are most of Symphony No.3, and all of Symphony No.4.  Symphony No.5 feels like it has a little limp.  Symphony No.6 is about as melodious as it should be. Symphonies 2, 7, and 8 are on par with what you might expect.  Symphony No.9 is a revelation.    All-in-all, this is a good complete recording, but definitely not imaginative (but that could be a good thing).  Liszt himself was very methodical, but always lent a strong amount of passion to his transcriptions and that comes through in this recording.  Katsaris seems competent, but not quite amazing.    This recording will probably sit well with most listeners because it is a good quality recording and is transcribed by a master of interpretation (Liszt).  Even to the well-versed, though, this performance comes off as satisfying overall.  If you are looking for a quality recording of the symphonies performed on piano, you will not be disappointed.
0385340990|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book. This is one of best books that I have read in a while. Yes, there are sweet characters that you simply fall in love with. The book takes place on the Guernsey Island. The writers descriptions had me envisioning the island so completely that I just fell totally and completely in love with not only the island but also the islanders. There is a bad character here and there peppered in but all in all the characters are totally charming. I won't ruin the story by telling you any more. If you love Jane Austin then you will adore this book. A wonderful love story as well.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|The two main female characters are entertaining although the overall storyline is... well, yawn. The supporting characters are okay although tiring. The DVD quality is a little disappointing, especially on a big HD-LCD, and our Season 2 Disk 8 DVD did not work for some reason.
0375826726|1.0|I'm still coming down from the disappointment caused from this book, and it compelled me to write my first review. After reading Brisingr, I see no reason for extending the series other than for Paolini's desire to earn as much money as possible. The plot is sorely lacking and extremely boring. All the worse is that the intermittent time is spent with drivel for dialogue concerning topics of little interest. In short, the book could have been condensed to about a third of the size and retained every bit of detail necessary. Overall this book does very little to dispute the claims of plot plagiarism on the part of Paolini. If anything this book establishes itself truly as the poor man's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or any other similar fantasy series.
0385340990|5.0|I also was leery of the title, kinda funny in my opinion but what a book and I am SO glad I picked it up! The setting of post WW2 in Guernsey and the way the book was written, all in letters, was a great way to get so indepth about each character and place. At the end, I was sad it was over. It was one of those books that you wanted to keep going - see what happens next. Thank you for a wonderful read!! I am not normally a fiction fan but given the setting and time period of the book, I wanted to give it a chance and I am happy I did.<br />Melissa - NJ
B001EO748M|5.0|I will pretty much read, watch or see anything Tudor related. Some stuff is just okay, but others - like Seasons 1 and 2 of The Tudors - really outshines the rest. The casting is superb, the costumes are to die for, and the scenery is just breath taking.    Do yourself a favor and rent this. You'll be entertained for hours and wish there were ten more seasons.
0975991477|5.0|I am not all the way through this book yet, but it is absolutely eye opening.  It appears to go well with Gregg Braden \\" The Spontaneous Healing of Belief\\", as I have read!!  Both are fascinating and very helpful in understanding and enlightening us to be able to change the way we look at things in order to better our mind, body, spirit  experience fort he better.  LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!

Hennessey makes him an offer he can't refuse<br />8. He becomes a man in an iron mask, with a killer car (literally), a female navigator (to boost PPV ratings) and a pit crew led by scene stealing Ian McShane.<br />9. Lots of stunt driving, shooting of big guns and explosions follow, although you really can't tell who's shooting at whom for most of it<br />10. People die<br /><br />Typical shoot `em up action movie involving high speed racing in armored cars and lots of bad guys, but with plot holes bigger than those left by the armor-piercing RPG Model 7's.<br /><br />Statham plays his usual tough guy \\"Transporter\\" role, and Tyrese Gibson does everything but sing the Coca Cola jingle as arch rival Machine Gun Joe.  They throw in a little inspirational family story to soften it up a little, and a teensy tiny little budding romance with dialogue like:<br /><br />Jensen Ames: [while driving] Get on my lap.<br />Case: What?<br />Jensen Ames: Get on my lap!<br /><br />Recommended for Statham fans and action movie buffs, but I can't see this one going down as a classic for all time.<br /><br />Jensen Ames: [to Hennessey] You wanted a monster? Well, you've got one.<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 22, 2008
B000NTPDSW|5.0|For those crying for the \\"Godfather Saga\\"/\\"Godfather Epic\\" versions, you are missing the point.  Restoration expert Robert Harris (and countless others) worked for over a year from the best available print materials (as the original negatives are badly damaged and faded) to restore the first and second films to their original theatrical glory, which is something these iconic films of American Cinema deserve.  That is the point of restoration.    If you are looking for a \\"wow\\" disc to show off your Blu-ray home theater sound and video, this is not it.  If you are looking to experience modern American Gangster cinema in its 1970's glory, this is as close as you are ever likely to get, muted sepia-esque color, film grain and all.    These were not done exclusively for the home market.  The priority was that they were restored for theatres, because that is where they would be judged the most critically, and all indications are that they do not disappoint.  Never watch these films in your living room with the lights on.  Watch them like you do in the theater, lights out, to appreciate the effort that went into these films.
0307386171|5.0|McEwan's books are like an Irish Ballad: beautiful, haunting, forlorn and difficult to forget, Chesil Beach is no exception. It is difficult not to finish the novel swiftly after reading the first sentence: \\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\" The novel continues with another of McEwan's trademarkes, weaving together unspeakable sexual intimacies with everyday happenings followed by the private thoughts of his characters. If one was disappointed at Atonement's ending I would suggest not reading Chesil Beach. But becoming well acquainted with McEwan's characters and seeing how their tragedy is a product of their time period is a process that will only broaden one's understanding of humanity.<br /><br />One marvels at McEwan's command of the English language. It is good to see that in this  age of haste there is an author who can remind one of life's subtleties; like the nervous tendency to brush aside a hair that isn't there. Somehow, McEwan manages to put into words those tiny moments that we all experience yet never consciously consider, and make them relevant, even central to the novel's theme. For this, McEwan's acuteness to words, I give his novella five stars. It is from these intricacies that the story is built and McEwan's moral of hindsight and failure hopefully help the reader appreciate all the imperfections in their own life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My arms are shaking, my legs are like jelly.<br /><br />Someone gave me this DVD as a gift back in July, and I REALLY wish I would have started it then...As it happens, I started it today after reading all the glowing reviews.<br /><br />The moves are easy, but man...I'm having a hard time typing this because I'm shaking haha. It's hard, and every time I'd need a boost to keep going, Jillian would say something to fire me up again. I laughed, I cursed, I laughed some more. She pushes you without being condescending, but she doesn't butter you up and sugar coat it either.<br /><br />This is just the first day, but seeing how tired I am and how good I feel after only 20 minutes on LEVEL ONE...I'm definitely going to keep it up. I'm so excited, and I can't wait to see what results I get from this. I already have been eating well, I just needed some direction in the fitness department. I never know what to do in the gym. I was also given The Biggest Loser cardio workout, so I think I'll do a combination of these two videos, plus a yoga stretch video, and see what happens.<br /><br />I'll update after a few weeks!<br /><br />Good luck, and if you haven't bought it already....BUY IT.

B001C3KCSY|4.0|It's only been a good year ago that Kings of Leon released their monster-sized album \\"Because of the Times\\", which ended up in my personal top 3 of the best albums of 2007. After releasing \\"Because of the Times\\", the band toured non-stop around the Americas and Europe, and so I was quite surprised to read a few months ago that a new album was already being finished for a Fall release. Here then comes the 4th studio album of Kings of Leon.<br /><br />\\"Only By the Night\\" (11 tracks; 43 min.) continues the trail-blazing ways of \\"Because of the Times\\", if possible even more so. The radio singles \\"Crawl\\" and \\"Sex on Fire\\" are quite good but also a bit misleading, in the sense that there are a lot of epic \\"atmospheric\\" songs, with plenty of walls of (guitar) sounds. This band has become now more than ever an arena-sized band. The highlights for me include \\"Manhattan\\" (one of the tracks they played at their headlining show at Glastonbury earlier this summer in the UK), \\"17\\" (the days of the Beatles' innocent lines like \\"Well she was young and 17/Yeah you know what I mean\\" are long gone....), and the album closer \\"Cold Desert\\", but honestly I didn't hear any 'weak' tracks on here. The CD I bought came with a bonus live CD (7 tracks, 25 min.) from a performance of the band in April, 2007 at the Hammersmith Appolo in London, bringing 4 tracks from the then-new \\"Because of the Times\\" album, including a terrific \\"Fans\\" (a salute to the band's huge UK fan base), \\"My Party\\", and \\"Arizona\\", along with a couple of \\"Aha Shake Heartbreak\\" album tracks, just terrific. Seek it out if you can.<br /><br />In all, \\"Only By the Night\\" is a great album. Is it as good as \\"Because of the Times\\"? Only time will tell: if I find myself playing this CD as much a year from now as I am still playing \\"Because of the Times\\", I will know the answer. Meanwhile, King of Leon's musical growth in just a matter of 4-5 years is simply amazing. \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" and \\"Aha Shake Heartbreak\\" almost sound like they were made by a different band (don't ever call them the \\"Southern Strokes\\" again!). Last but not least, KoL are HUGE in Europe, particularly in the UK. I don't know whether they'll ever break as big here in the US, but certainly this album is better than 99% of the stuff released these days.ere made by a different band (don't ever call them the \\"Southern Strokes\\" again!).

B00006D295|1.0|In 1975, if memory serves, Rocky Horror was invented and the musical comedy, no doubt to your knowledge became a super-cult crave following all over the globe. Transients, drug users, queens and flamboyant lots, eccentric film buffs of all shady styles, cross dressing wall street stiffs, kids at heart, Parrotheads...that common bond that can make Rocky Horror have a very broad flavor of fans.<br /><br />Perhaps I never grew onto the 12 midnight showings of this film during my early twenties, or the live stage shows, because well, its like Gallagher, why would anyone be interested? The groupies that abound RHPS type events are all whack-jobs.<br /><br />I love musicals, I love nutty, insane, brilliant and not so brilliant films. Love Oliver!, Love the Sound of Music, even the sleeper Newsies, love the 'can't sing for squat', talented Rex Harrison in Dr. DooLittle, even sort of loved Moulin Rouge, not quite, but almost and of course Willy Wonka. (Wilder, not Depp)<br /><br />Rocky Horror is the kind of movie that wants to sit next to films like 'Donnie Darko', 'Something Wicked This Way Comes', 'Almost Famous', perhaps even next to 'Queen's Live at Wembley Stadium', (for the cult appeal), however the only place it will find a spot in my heart for is a review on Amazon. Richard Obrien and Tim Curry's talent not withstanding, let the mess of this film have its bloodbath of rave reviews from gender-bending, egotistical, self centered, pompous jerks, who parade around like its Carnival in Rio; and the tacky, boring, mindless film can attest to that following and lend its hand onto perhaps a new, more accepting myspace, emo culture who will eat it up and ask for seconds almost immediately.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Words fail to praise the action-packed period film that Akira Kurosawa created in 1954 Japan. Two years after the allies released the Japanese from occupation, Kurosawa directed the best film ever, in my opinion, for those that desire evil to be overthrown and justice to prevail. The plight of the peasants is graphically detailed in breath-taking scenes of beauty and poise. Coming to their aid is the most virtuous samurai in film history, ready at a moment to battle the bandits that would rob, rape, and murder the helpless peasantry. The camera angles and positioning are excellent beyond belief, the costumes are real, and the mud is thick for the final battle scene. Any movie fan that doesn't have the recent Criterion Collection Seven Samurai is missing out on a classic. Honor, loyalty, skill, and faith  come alive on the screen in 17th century Japan.
031606792X|4.0|I liked the beginning of the book but not so much after the 20th or so chapter. I liked that there were many surprisng parts and some i expectred but mainly there was tons of mystery that kept me reading on. i didnt like the ending becuase i read these series due to the fact that there not cheesy highschool love stories with expected endings but this ends exactly as youd expect a movie to with a dumb ending. I was disspaointed that one its the last book and the way it ended didnt help. Even though i didnt really enjoy the book i think people my age have and will enjoy it especially if they are into books with fantasy mystery romance and horror books.
0143038419|5.0|This book is for many people but especially for someone who has battled depression or for a friend/family member of someone working through depression -it really enlightened me to the plight of a person who is dealing with this disease...    Straight away Ms. Gilbert let's the reader know in the introduction that she won't discuss the details surrounding the breakdown of her marriage, and I respect that.  A main point of contention for many disappointed readers appears to be connected with that lack of disclosure.     It is my humble opinion that Ms. Gilbert's intent is to demonstrate that depression is about self absorption and this is her story of internal and external self discovery!  No one can truly love another person or help another until they wholly love and accept their imperfect self.  Getting to this level of understanding requires alot of self contemplation.    I found the book engaging, enlightening and uplifting. The characters were rich (I loved Richard from Texas!) and so vivid.  I feel as if I spent time with some really wonderful people in three wonderful locations.    Ms. Gilbert's growth was immense and I am anxious to read the next book.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This special edition of American Psycho was fantastic. For those of you who have read the book, you will find the screenplay version -- which captures all of the salient parts of the story -- of equal comparison. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, an extremely neurotic and obsessive 1980's yuppie, who \\"deals\\" with stress in a horrific (but darkly comedic) way. You'll never think of Huey Lewis or Phil Collins in the same way again.
B00005O3VC|5.0|For mindless entertainment I love to watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  There is no rhyme or reason to the movie, just a bunch of people doing stupid stuff and making it hilarious.  There's no need for neverending flatulance jokes (which is overplayed in almost every comedy of today) or a need to make fun of different races and cultures just to get a cheap laugh.  What it is is pure stupidity that makes you practically wet yourself when you watch it.  I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and laugh hysterically every time (as if it's the first time I'm seeing it and hearing the jokes).  This movie is perfect for those who feel like today's comedy's are overdone.  It's full of fresh comedy (which no one since has even tried to copy) and doesn't bore you with repetitiveness<br /><br />This movie, however, is NOT for everyone.  ESPECIALLY OVERANALYZERS!!  You need to watch the movie for what it is.....a silly comedy.  There is no need to analyze why there's coconuts and no horses or why a woman is getting weighed.  If you want something to ananlyze watch a documentary or a serious movie and go to a coffee shop afterwards to swap notes.  Don't do it while watching the movie and definitely DON'T WATCH THIS ONE!

I love the message that we're all so alike as babies despite where we live or what color our skin is.  It is so relevant to babies as I am always kissing my babies toes and fingers.  Helen Oxenbury has produced beautiful illustrations that are pivotal to the language!  Can't wait for the board book!!!
0385340990|5.0|I just took a vivid time travel back to the days of World War II on the isle of Guernsey as I read the book. The character development was so wonderful that I fell in love with the characters.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|This is not the Kings of Leon that I know.....the gritty southern rockers from Youth and Young Manhood are gone and have been replaced with a polished, overproduced band that is trying wayyy too hard rather than just rocking from the gut.  What has happened to songs like Trani, California Waiting, Talihina Sky, Slow Night So Long, King of the Rodeo, and Razz???  Where is that southern garage twang and raw energy?  The Kings seem to be too preoccupied with their commercial sound and appearance to make tracks similar to those that made Bob Dylan turn his head back in the day.  I have been a fan of KOL for quite some time now, and I've enjoyed all their records including Because of the Times.  I know they have gone on tour with bands such as U2 and Pearl Jam, who have definitely taught them a thing or two and influenced their musical abilities.  Still, there is no reason to abandon your roots in an attempt to emulate others.      There are plenty who will enjoy this record, but in my opinion most of these songs have no lasting power.  Although they may sound catchy at first, most become old and repetitious soon there after.  Standouts include Cold Desert, I Want You, and maybe Closer.  If this is your first KOL record, you will probably like the overused hooks and arena-like guitar sounds, but don't be fooled.  This is not the great KOL from Holy Roller Novocaine.  Hopefully I am not the only one that longs for those days.
0596004966|5.0|This is a great C++ reference. After some years of mostly C and Java programming, I was able to review the language main points in a single day.<br /><br />It is a useful book for non-full-time C++ developers.

0439813786|5.0|A great story to read and share with a child. The format changes back and forth between words and then pages of images that tell the story. You can read to the child, then let the child \\"read\\" the pictures to you. A thick book, but it goes quickly.
B000TSJU0E|5.0|This review is only for the original album since I don't care much about bonus tracks or DVDs, but since you brought it up, I will say that the \\"bonus\\" live tracks on disc 1 sound homemade. I can't believe they were included here.<br /><br />Anyway, to the main course: The original CD release, and even the Eliminator material in the gorgeous \\"Chrome, Smoke, and BBQ\\" box set just never did anything for me sound wise. Sure, it's great rock 'n' roll, but the digital mastering didn't do it justice. This remastering changes that. The music comes to life with punch, presence, and transparency - and it was done with no noticeable compression. They even resisted the urge to master it too loudly. This is a remaster that both the average CD buyer and the audiophile will be VERY happy with.
B000TIO4Z0|4.0|Callas is one of my favorite, and this package offers a unique chance for her fans to enjoy her beauty heritage in studio. Generally speaking, quality is good and acceptable at this price.     However, the only problem I had is that I got two CD 29, but without CD30. This is quite annoying. Though I could ask for return following amazon rule, sending it back from China to US? I won't do this because it's too troublesome...
B001C5ZR1E|3.0|The product information is jumbled because those who placed it have no idea what the product is. First off, is it really an LP not a CD? Secondly, the despairing different information between Amazon.com essential recording, the Product Description and the Track Listing are mind-boggling. Start off with the Track Listing, which is the CD order of the original 1971 LP listing. The Product Description throws another problem into the mess when it states, \\"UK LP pressing. Contains a voucher enabling the purchaser to download MP3 versions of the songs within\\" but the Label listing is Geffen Records, an American company. At least it does use the term \\"pressing\\" which would indicate an LP, but such miss information doesn't prove that to be valid. Even more glaring is because it is the \\"Who's Next [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] [EXTRA TRACKS]\\" (1995) Product Description verbatim. The Track Listing on the 2008 product is seven songs short of the Product Description. Also, the \\"voucher,\\" if you were to get the UK LP pressing, would you have to sign up for company in order \\"to download MP3 versions of the songs within,\\" or what? I believe you'd have to sign up for a subscription with a company (which means pay money) since they didn't give you the MP3 tracks outright. And there is the price tag! WOW $19.98 regular with a whopping 5% off. O Amazon is giving customers a wonderful deal! What makes this product better, is it Blue Ray, are they DVD quality as Townshend has advocated on his own website? Are these from the Masters or Remastered?    I love the album, but what it is that Amazon is selling is such a mysterious product that they do not know what it is!
B00005214X|4.0|When the Beatles were recording in the 1960s, those of us who were total fans and knew every album and single word-by-word also knew we were missing out since there never seemed to be enough room for more than maybe one George Harrison song.    After the group split, the album All Things Must Pass proved to be filled with songs Harrison fans had always just known were sitting inside his quiet and spiritual demeanor. George Harrison may not have been able to answer all the big questions but he sure tried - especially in this varied collection.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I saw it whaen it first came out, and bought the VHS. Then I bought the disc when those came out. Then came the Anniversary Collectors Edition and I had to own it! Outstanding set, indeed!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I approached this album with a certain level of skepticism given the flop that was St. Anger. However, I can say, as a hardcore, lifelong Metallica fan, that this is easily one of the best four albums they have ever made. A return to form that no other band has yet to rival, \\"Death Magnetic\\" is easily the best rock album made in the last 5 years. I listened to it front to back, and found something amazing in every song. Some of the guitar solos are eerily reminiscent of \\"And Justice for All\\"-era Metallica. In fact, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" can be seen as a 21st-century rendition of \\"One.\\" While it's no \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" this album lived up to my expectations in so many ways. Overall, this is an awesome record that even the purists can enjoy.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|...seem to be given in the heat of the early moments--in that time when you first hear a new band you like and listen to them too much for your own good.  There is certainly something to be said of a band that can induce such a... heated state.  However, while this album is wonderful, it is not the best you've ever heard.    Do you like contemporary, indie incarnations of 'folk music'/'folk rock' (do you like Vetiver, Kings of Convenience, The Shins, Bon Iver, Papercuts, The Avett Brothers...and I'm sure many other [those are just some of mine, I'm sure many have there own favorites])?  When a band is compared to Simon & Garfunkel and the Beach Boys, is that a positive thing to you?  Do you like gospel and Allison Krauss?    Or maybe you just liked the soundtrack to \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" and haven't searched much beyond that ('til now).    Well, you will like this album (and the band's EP, Sun Giant).  You will like this album, and you will hope for many more from this band.  So now, buy it and support 'em.
0375826726|2.0|It appears that Paolini has graduated from ripping off specific fantasy canon to just start writing generic fantasy. This story is basically about Eragon growing up to one day become Rand al Thor. Complete with philosophical meandering about those he's killed only to churn up enemies as if his character really has no humanity at all, but is a large woodchipper. Probably one of the worst scenes in the entire book was the farce of Eragon's cousin going on about how terrible it is to kill people who are being forced to fight the rebels and then boasting over the count of body bags he caused. Very little actually happens in this book. Not just plot point wise but character development wise as well. Eragon moderates a bit from his high handed vegetarianism, but that's about the total of character development for him this entire book. The book is full of mindless description that basically destroys the overall flow as well. It's basically action scene, 200 pages of nothing, action scene, 200 pages of nothing, action scene, 200 pages of nothing, to be concluded by an action scene.    Paolini gets two stars because he has improved at action, but it just lulls so hard in between the action.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout!  I'd heard everyone say it really isn't a beginner workout, and in many respects it's not.  HOWEVER, if you want to improve your shape and cardio health, fast, this is the workout.  And I love that it really is only about 20 minutes.  Who can't fit in a 20 minute workout?  I would love to see her do another!!
B000002H7I|1.0|Enjoyed her first album. So I bought this one thinking it would be good as well. But, she's taken a bite out of the Racist/Political pie. Most of the songs take swipes at White Men and Conservative viewpoints. Same thing happened to Iris Dement when she compromised her style for her political viewpoints....She bombed. This is a stinker except for a select few including \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\".
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Many bands that stick around for more than 1 or 2 albums seem (IMHO) to follow a trend with two identifiable characteristics: (1) change, and (2) increasing commercial appeal.  I think the complaints that \\"these guys aren't the Kings of Leon they used to be\\" are tedious and based on a ridiculous expectation.  It's going to happen (if the band is any good and not Pearl Jam), so get over it.  I don't really care whether 10 or 1,000,000 other people want to listen to the album, or even whether a band was explicit in attempting to target a larger audience.  The proper questions, it seems to me, are: Is is it good?  Do I like listening to it?  Is it going to stay in my car stereo for more than a few days?  My answers to the first two are: Yes! and Yes!  I can't answer the third yet, but if their last album is any indication... probably so.
0596101996|5.0|Great book, easy read, well formated and very instrutive. You will find everything that you need about JavaScript (covering standard ECMAScript v3). From the basics to the most advance about the language.
0375826726|2.0|This book is full of fluff.  I was fortunate enough to listen to it instead of read it and thereby able to get other tasks done and I don't need to demand hours of my life back.  When Gerard Doyle would change his voice to read certain pointless characters (eg the dwarf mother who lived far below the city) I would fast forward until the story would return to slightly less pointless of characters.      I enjoyed the first 2 books of this former \\"Trilogy\\" because unlike Brisingr, they contain an individual subplot, which not only adds to the series but also allows them to be enjoyed separately of the others.  This book progresses the series in only a few areas, and of those areas most were so obvious going into it that you could skip this book and maybe with a few pages of flashbacks turn this series back into a Trilogy with Eragon, Eldest, and the fourth/final book.    If you must read this book, I would recommend reading/listening to an abridge version just before the next one comes out.
0375826726|3.0|This was a fun read, held me from beginning to end, but I did have a few problems with it:    * Over dramatic, paragraph by paragraph writing style.  * Everything is much \\"too convenient\\" and predictable.  * Too much time wasted on pointless explanations of things instead of creating simple, effective ways for the reader to figure them out on their own.   * Bad character development, i.e. Nasuada? I personally feel this character is a complete failure.   * Very little advancement of the plot was made for the amount of story to you had to read.    I have to admit I am somewhat overly critical, but I cannot help myself.  Either way as I previously mentioned, it was still enjoyable to once again dive into this marvelous world Paolini has created, and I would be lying if I said I was not looking forward to the next novel.  If you enjoyed the first two books, you should most definitely read Brisingr, although you might not find it as rewarding and enthralling.
B000VS6R26|5.0|I was one of the few who knew this was going to be good.  The hype before the film came out was mostly negative. Plagued by delays the film quickly became the most expensive film ever made. But I was steadfast on seeing it, because I liked all of James Cameron's films, and I was certain to go see this one regardless of what the story was.    And then the film came out and it was great. May not have been the best picture of the year, but it is one of the few films that have won best picture that weren't the best pictures of their year, that I believed earned the title because of the struggle the filmmakers went through to make this movie.    Now, watching and listening to James Cameron's commentary, ten years after the film's release, I like it even more, for he explains in this feature length commentary, how things he was doing in Titanic were revolutionary, but have now become the norm. The green screen compositing to transition from one sceen to the next, used ad-nausea in Speed Racer was pioneered in Titanic. The computer generated extensions of backgrounds and sets that were used in films such as Garden State was in the infancy stage when Cameron used it on this film. Cameron is big on research, and you can tell by the detail he goes into the story and each character that appears on the screen. His very insightful and thorough commentary and I strongly recommend it for anybody who wants to be a filmmaker.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|Boring, boring, boring, and more boring. I love every previous album this band has put out, but this album is awful. There is not one upbeat song, and the slow downbeat songs are poorly crafted and lack any originality. I blame U2; the tour they did together clearly has had a lasting impact, as KOL now sounds like a derivative southern cover band.     If you love U2 you'll love this album.

It is action packed from the start and you are completely engaged with the characters.  I can't wait to know more about them and get to read more about their world.  I suggested this to any parent or teen.  I've suggested it to my own.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Perfect buy  Fast shipment  CD in super condition    Can only recommend this seller.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I just picked up this version plus bonus cd at Best Buy today.     If you are a David Gilmour fan, this is a must have item.  Also,  this could be Richard Wright's last great performance with the band.  Sorry to hear that he died of cancer just one week ago.  This alone  made this a must have item for me.    I have only watched the first DVD in this set and all I can say  is the video and audio are simply awesome.      Many of David's previous tunes are featured on this set accompanied  by the Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra, giving it a slightly different  sound which I really enjoyed.     The sound is more detailed and polished than in the previous   'Remember That Night' DVD which I would also give 5 stars.    I cannot wait to hear the rest of the CD's and the other DVD in   this set!    Update: I just listened to all he CDs and I was struck by the  incredible detail and dynamic range they have.  Much better range  than my 13 year old CD set of Pink Floyd's 'Pulse' concert which   certainly is no slouch.      At this point I'm not sure if these CDs are a direct clone of the   DVD or not.  It doesn't appear to be, but I could be wrong.
B00000253N|5.0|In the slighted reflection of a time gone by, where progressive blue-rock was the soul and voice of a generation, perhaps this album is easily lost amongst the tide of masterpieces that flooded in seemingly from all directions. Indeed, 'Highway' and 'Blonde on Blonde' can be seen as far more 'important' albums, at least as far as musical - as well as social - evolution is concerned.    But as the dust settles on those days, we begin to form a clearer picture of that which owes itself truly to the music. For Dylan, there was no greater moment than Blood On The Tracks. Released at a time when Vietnam, Woodstock, and the swingin'-60's were blemishes in the rear-view mirror, the Man somehow tapped into something quite magical - something greater than social or political despair, something more significant than electric folk and blues laden rock riffs. He tapped into love.     Never since, before, or during, have I ever witnessed such a concentrated and definitive exploration of the soul: where love is born, and where it goes to die. We are taken on an intensely personal journey into one man's mind, into his emotions - through a chiaroscuro of pleasure and despair, of hopefulness and hopelessness, of humor, anger, fear, fate, delusion, death.    Like I said in the title, pick your poison. There is much littered through this album (in a good way, obviously). And if this poison happens truly to be fatal, I will have died happily.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|Wether or not you will like this album depends entirely on if you like the \\"old\\" Kings or the \\"new\\" Kings.  I've been listening to these guys since the day Youth and Young Manhood came out.  I've seen them live four times and met them on the Aha Shake tour.  That being said the reason I liked them was their raw energy.  The first two albums sounded like a hungry band making a rock record held together by chicken wire.  But that's what I loved about it.  Seeing them live it felt like it could fall apart at any minute - just true rock n roll.  With that being said they go on one tour with U2 and now they are trying to emulate them in every way possible.  Because of the Times was not a bad record - it was worse - boring.  Just because these guys figured out how to add reverb in the studio doesn't make them \\"epic\\" or \\"arena\\".  The songs lost all their bite, all their energy and everything that made them an interesting band.  Only by the Night continues right where Because of the Times left off.  If you took every slow song off BotT and made that the album - you would have Only by the Night.  There are a couple redeeming tracks.  \\"Closer\\" is a great song - if they are going to go in this direction musically this is the kind of song they should be making.  \\"Use Somebody\\" has an infectious vocal cadance.  \\"Crawl\\" is okay but really just sounds like a throw away from Because of the Times.  The rest of the album is just a reverb drenched bore.  Just because a band has more money to spend is the studio and they figured out how to work Pro-Tools doesn't mean they are \\"progressing\\".  With all that - if you like Because of the Times (especially the slow songs) you will like this album.  But be warned - there is not one rocker on here.  If you're like me and you like the Kings of Youth and Young Manhood and Aha-Shake you will hate this album.  On a final note to the Kings - you aren't U2 - stop trying to emulate them.  Be proud to be the Kings that you were.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Seriously?  You feel the need to read a review to decide weather or not you should buy Death Magnetic???  Clearly you need more help than reviews can provide.  Buy it. It's awesome. Every song flows together like a Heavy Metal Opera.  It has all the sounds of the Black Album, Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning rolled into one fantastic album of new songs.<br />I was a little put off at first by the cardboard packaging as opposed to the standard plastic case, but once you flip through the coffin, you'll see the creativity behind it.  I cant wait to hear the songs live in December.<br />And hey, I dont want to hear the words sell outs and Metallica used in the same sentence again.
B0013527I4|5.0|My husband is a big Muppets fan, and when he found out Season Three was out on DVD, he didn't even ask.. he just ordered it.   sure, some of the guests stars we are like: Huh? whozzat?  but all in all, it's a great romp overall.
068485743X|3.0|In the First Five Pages, Noah Lukeman reveals the quickest ways a manuscript is tossed into the rejection pile. Think your numerous alliterations are clever? Manuscript readers don't. Believe you're subtlety slipping in backstory when your characters discuss their pasts? Nope, it's annoying and contrived. Subscribe to the belief that the more drama, the better? Please unsubscribe.<br /><br />This book's value ultimately lies with Lukeman's editing credentials. He organizes this book according to what an editor first looks for when reading a manuscript. He tackles preliminary problems (adjectives, adverbs, comparisons, etc.) that can get your manuscript axed right away, and then focuses on bigger picture items (hooks, tone, setting, etc). At the end of each chapter, Lukeman provides helpful exercises to help you practice what you've just learned.<br /><br />His book isn't without flaws. His own writing needs a little polish (he *loves* using passive voice). I also disagreed with his frequent recommendation that writers should choose \\"unusual\\" words. He later interchanges unusual with precise (which is much more appropriate), but he should have added a caveat telling writers not to go overboard. I can picture amateur writers using this advice and swapping boxers for pugilists (not a good idea). Finally, his examples of what not to do are way over the top. Lukeman admits this, and to be fair, his examples clearly illustrate his points. But he should have added mediocre examples, writing that will *just* tip the writer into the rejection pile.<br /><br />However, Lukeman provides great advice with regard to dialogue, and I especially liked his chapters on subtlety. He provides much more good advice than bad, especially in his later chapters. It's funny in a way that his own book starts off rocky, but it's worth finishing it. Overall, first-time writers will get the most benefit out of the First Five Pages. More experienced writers (especially those who have been published) can do without it.

B000002B35|5.0|Pulse: Pink Floyd has produced The Best Show Ever. Anyone that gives this show less than 5 stars is oblivious to what a great show consists of. Check-this-out, it has been reproduced in a stunniing HIGH QUALITY picture, AWESOME SOUND from the 90's,<br /> Pink Floyds operating cost was $750,000 per day. They used almost 200 hundred people to set up the stage. Had to get FAA approval prior to each outdoor show to use laser lights Their laser shows were particularly famous, such as their use of extremely powerful, isotope-splitting copper-vapor lasers in the 1994 Division Bell tour. These gold-colored lasers were worth over $120,000 apiece and previously used only in nuclear research and high speed photography..<br /><br /> Again this show is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. No one will ever touch this show, at least not in the near future. IF you have a big screen and haven't seen this Masterpiece, then I urge you to go out and buy this Double DVD ASAP.<br />You will not regret it!<br />Then give this 5 star review as only it should deserve ;)<br />SOMEONE TELL me what DVD in concert deserves a higher rating than this?

1400032717|5.0|\\"This book was so terrific that, when I read a passage of it to my teenage son, he said, \\"I want to read that when you get finished.\\" Well, I finished quickly (it's short) and gave it to him. He read it!<br /><br />Why is that so amazing? Well, my son reads about one book every 2 years. He loved it.<br /><br />I have a friend who has an autistic son. While reading this, I could imagine that, yes, my friend's son seems to quite possibly think this way.<br /><br />It's amazing how Mark Haddon was able to tell this story from the viewpoint of someone that is autistic. Autistic people cannot truly communicate how they think and feel to us. but Mr. Haddon seems to have hit it on the head.<br /><br />You don't really read this book for the story, which is interesting, but not terrific, you read it for the WRITING.\\"
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been Metallica fan since primary school and days of Master of Puppets. My favorite album is Justice, barely, cause I love first 5 equally. Load was beginning of the nightmare, which culminated with that Anger. After that I never thought I'll hear something good from the guys again.    Couldn't be more happy they proved me wrong! Death Magnetic is one of those 'love at first hearing' albums. From the first riffs to the last ones it doesn't let down. There are very few bumps along the way but most of the ride is in supersonic mode. Everything has been said so far so I won't go into the songs. My faves are all but Cyanide and Unforgiven III but even those two are OK. Everything else is thunder and lightning.    As much as I love old, legendary stuff, I just wish they play entire DM, from the first to the last track, on the upcoming tour! I'm bit tired of the old stuff, concerts began to feel repetitive. Death Magnetic is breath of fresh air and I want to breathe it with my full lungs. I wouldn't mind if they would play it two times per night :-)    While listening to the songs I simply can't wait to hear them live! This is going to be the ultimate weapon of neck destruction!    See yaa on the tour or rehabilitation :-)
B00192KCQ0|4.0|A review of the package as a whole, but the rate is mainly for the Gutar Hero III Version, which doesn't suffer clipping (white noise).  -----------------------------------------------------------  Digipack-edition    -Cover and Inserts 4/5. The cover is ok. I liked the way the package and lyrics are displayed, but I didn't like the fact that the lyrics don't follow the track list, there's not much artwork too.    -Songs 4/5. After many listens 80% of the album is a sort of a \\"grower\\". Two songs became \\"skippers\\" (the day that never comes, and unforgiven III).    -Production/final Mix/mastering or however you want to call it 0/5. The only album I can think of having the same compression, clipping, and distortion is Rush's Vapor Trails.     -Instrument playing and vocals;           * Vocals 3/5; , very well sung, though it sounds bad on the day that never comes. There's a few reminiscences of the YEAH, word extensions, so typical in the 1991-2003 era. Lyrics are bad, not up to par with his old writing.           * Guitars 5/5; This is the best guitar work since 1988.           * Bass 4/5; Almost unlistenable in the mix. Hard to rate, but what you can hear is a very well done job.           * Drums 0/5; This is the most anoying drumming I've heard in years only topped by himself on St.Anger. He needs to go back to basics, take some drumming lessons, whatever...           * Average 3/5    -Sound of instruments/vocals:           * Vocals 4/5; James sounds fine on almost every track. He sounds too digital and forced in \\"the day that never comes\\"           * Guitars 5/5; This is the \\"and justice..\\" sound, right?. I really liked the sound of the guitars.           * Bass 4/5; Bring it up on the mix!. Rob sounds great (when you can hear him).           * Drums 0/5; Awful sound, too loud in the mix. I understand if Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater) wants to sound loud in the mix, but Lars is less than average, so he should be burried in the mix (bring up the guitars and bass), hehas nothing to contribute to the songs.           * Average 3.25/5              If I were to rate this copy the average would be 2.85 stars. Not good, right. But the truth is that I love the album.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Gutar Hero III Version  - Cover and Inserts, there's no package so i won't rate this.    - Songs 4/5 (same as above)    - Production/final Mix/mastering or however you want to call it 4/5, now we're talking, this is the one that should have been pressed on the CD, my only complain is that the drum is too loud, bring it down!!!    -Instrument playing and vocals, average 3/5 same as above. Lars bring this album down.    -Sound of instruments/vocals 3.5/5, now you can hear Rob (5/5 for bass playing), all the rest, same as in the above description.    My rating for the GHIII version according to the numbers would be 3.6/5, but as I stated above, I love this album so taking into account the \\"liking\\" factor I would rate this album a solid 4/5.     It's interesting how they recapture the old sound and they stripped the best of what can be found on the 1991-2003 era, which by the way is not much.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Liquid Swords is a true work of art and stands to this day as the finest work that Wu-Tang ever put on wax.    Unlike alot of albums which come off as a bunch of singles put together, Liquid Swords works as a single unified, thematic piece with all of the songs blending together to form a dark, nightmarish vision of the streets which has more in common with a Stephen King horror movie that with most of the other hip hop that was coming out at the time.    This album, for me, proved once and for all that the RZA stood alone as the the most exciting and creative producer in Hip Hop.  Pete Rock, Premier, Dre were all outstanding but they tended to stick to their signature sound.  RZA's tracks were different from album to album and on this album everything comes together.  The kung fu samples fit perfectly with the beats.  He uses crazy sound effects like electric guitars, feedback, explosions etc not usually associated with hip hop to create something new, exciting and frightening.    What can I say about the GZA.  Outside of Illmatic era Nas, there was no other MC who was as descriptive and literate in describing the street life.  GZA could talk about the most brutual and violent topics and still make it sound like fine art.    This album was a true team effort..every member of the Clan at the time appeared on the album in some capacity which is another reason that it is my favorite.    A couple of highlights from this classic album...    Dual of the Iron Mic- Ominous Kung Fu movie sample in the beginning along with sound effects of a rain storm go into what may be RZA's best beat ever.  An absolute, trunk rattling monster with a sick bassline and piano loop accented with explosion and feedback sound effects.  GZA sets it off nice (Picture blood baths and elevator shafts....)    Cold War- Very memorable hook and Ins. Deck absolutely kills it with the second verse on the song.    4th Chamber- Crazy, tripped out electric guitar intro before it goes into a more conventional beat.  The best verse of \\"Pre-Cuban Linx\\" Ghostface's career (The only kid I'll hold weight for) and quite possibly RZA's greatest verse ever.    Killa Hills 10304- Great synthesizer sample and one of GZA's trademark crime narratives.    This album is a home run.  While everyone else was copying Pete Rock and Premier doing the horn and piano thing death.  RZA was in the lab creating new sounds.  Along with his best MC, GZA, they created this masterpiece which will go down in history as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.
0307455874|5.0|For those who claim that Barack Obama does not have experience, does not have policies, and does not have a vision of where the country should go..this book will refute all of those assumptions in their entirety.  The amazing breadth and depth of the issues he has worked, has considered, and the deep thinking about those surfaces rapidly and in a succinct and direct manner in this book.  He is clearly a mind that can systhesize many complexities into a rational course of action that avoids extremism, and goes to reality and practicality.  The messages reflect a brilliant mind, a willingness to consider ideas with experts in depth, and solid solutions. Highly recommend.
038533348X|4.0|The cat's cradle is an extraordinary tale about the extent of human limitations when incompatibilities exist between the goals of science and humanity. Vonnegut created another masterpiece that describes the dangers of human science when mixed with their desires and lewdness.<br /><br />John, the narrator, is writing a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and in the process of his research discovers the life of Felix Hoenikker, the Nobel prize-winning physicist and one of the creators of the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Similar to walking through a hilarious human maze, we are taken to San Lorenzo; a town were Hoenikker's two sons and daughter live and ignorantly use their father's last invention causing another world wide human disaster.<br />Vonnegut brilliantly shows human limitations and foolishness with his description of an imaginary religion called Bokononism, which originated and blossomed in San Lorenzo.<br /><br />Vonnegut, who survived the cruelty of war and faced life's emptiness, is one of the few writers who can laugh at the human inability to reconcile the inherent conflict of science's power and capabilities with the needs and limitations of humanity.
0061122416|1.0|This is a very simple story about Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who dreams of a treasure under the Egyptian pyramids. After meeting a strange old man and a gypsy fortuneteller, Santiago sets out for Egypt determined to find his treasure. Along the way, he learns spiritual lessons from an Algerian shopkeeper, an English scholar, and finally the eponymous alchemist.<br /><br />I am a fan of deep, complicated characters, and this book has none (AT ALL). It's like a self-help book turned into a story, and I'm sure many people will find it deeply moving...... until the next fad comes along. (Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Prayer of Jabez, Chicken Soup for the Soul, The Secret, etc.) I will be really surprised if this book has any staying power.
B000053VAF|5.0|Great story line, written by Kevin Smith; two angels expelled from Heaven are seeking a way to get back, and they find it - in the Catholic Church, by way of plenary indulgence.  It's up to the Last Scion and a few others (including Jay and Silent Bob - snoogins!) to stop them before they unmake creation.

B001BR5F4C|5.0|I've noticed roughly a 25-35% (moderate yet significant) improvement in the quality of the presentation in the Blu-ray vs. DVD editions.  There are no new special features (which remain quite limited), so the question is: Does the superior picture and sound alone justify the expense?  I already own the DVD versions and the answer is yes -- because Tarantino somehow manages to blend many of the cooler bits and pieces from 70's pop screen culture into an original experience which in the end is as satisfying dramatically as it is entertaining.  Uma Thurman of course deserves more credit than she's received.  As I mentioned, the audiovisual improvement isn't huge--nor would I expect it to be for films released in the last 5-odd years--but if you're a fan enough to want the best quality then you've found it.
B000002HMH|4.0|This was when James was still James. He wasnt taking lessons by some psychiatrist on how to be \\"in touch with his feelings\\" and all that. He was James Hetfield: angry, screwed up and self destructive....the only difference here is that hes more mature, and naturally explored other musical tastes he was into. Namely blues.<br /><br /> The blues have been a cornerstone to rock n roll and metal music, and we see MetallicA expounding upon that. Its dark and heavy but makes you wanna move a bit more than just head bang and push 'n shove in a mosh pit. Load has way more groove to it.<br /><br />\\"Aint My B__tch\\" is an upbeat opener. Its catchy hard rock that has that MetallicA touch. Its got this slight southern heavy feel to it that i love. The guitar solo is evident of that. Good opener.<br /><br />\\"2x4\\" hits us upside the head with that blues sound, but darker than typical blues music. mix it with heavy guitar and James's evil growling vocals, and you got an idea of what it might sound like. This song deserves to be played while your drinking some beer or liquor and having smoke. This song might be more of an acquired taste, but its good stuff.<br /><br />\\"The House That Jack Built\\" is probubly one of my very favorite of the songs on Load. Clocking at 6 minutes and 38 seconds, MetallicA progress with a bit longer song. With a memorable chorus thats very inspiring. This is a dark, and even uplifting song, if you can believe it...in a downtrodden way. One of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />Now \\"Until It Sleeps\\" was the first big hit single on this album. I remember when i first heard it on the radio. It wasnt epic metal music...but i remember not complaining. It was its own beast. It was heavy and dark in its own right. Sure i didnt have any thrash speed guitar, but i honestly didnt notice. The song was that good. Dark inspired memorable hard rock, with a very memorable bass line opener. Cant forget that. Another good track that has a lot of lyrical meaning.<br /><br />\\"King Nothing\\" almost seems like it could of been done on maybe the Black Album, it always tricks me, and i have to remember that its not metal, more than its some groovy evil sounding hard rock with that blues influence. Not all heavy music has to be fast as hell. This song cocks more attitude, a attribute ive always loved about later MetallicA albums like this. They werent just pissed, James gave us that \\" I DONT GIVE A F--CK\\" attitude , that made us wanna kick down someones door, with a shotgun in one hand and a beer in the other. Good song.<br /><br />\\"Hero Of The Day\\" slows it down a tad, though it has a bit of an upbeat bridge and heavy chorus. The verses James sing are soothing, inspired and filled with power as it builds up. Definatly one of the more memorable songs on the album. It has an almost haunting melancholy to it, but it definatly has its heavy parts. Another very good song, and very meaningful song. ( the S&M version is even more powerful and moving)<br /><br />\\"Bleeding Me\\" requires a bit more from the listener. Its over 8 minutes long. And hopefully MetallicA fans and casual listeners have a decent attention span lol. This is a very layed back, reflective song. More great singing from James, and yet it still manages to build up into something heavy. Further exploring that dark hard rock, structured around a somewhat blues influence.  Remember, traces of the blues can be found in 80s MetallicA as well, you find it really in all metal and rock, but MetallicA really dug deeper into that influence and took it to the next level. This song returns to epic song lengths of old, but it takes us to another world, a world thats still pitch black.<br /><br />The \\"Cure\\" is one of their more experimental songs. Its not a bad song, but its not as outstanding as the other songs, but still gives us more groovy riffs, and its worth listening to. The part when it goes \\"...Uncross your arms...\\" that sounds like they channeled the Black Album. That little partsounded so heavy, it kinda makes you want MetallicA to kick into over drive and turn it into a speed metal song...but to no avail lol. ( Just go pop in the Black Album if you start getting sentimental ) Again, not a bad song. just not extremely special.<br /><br />\\"Poor Twisted Me\\" is another acquired taste. Steps back into that dark bluesy mode, but is a bit more infectious, makes me want to sing along. Could work as another drinking song at a bar. Thats what i like about. Its an okay song, just might take a few listens to really appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Waste My Hate\\" is an okay song. just another hard rock song infused with some of that blues infatuation. Might be considered filler. but its not a bad song. it doesnt fall flat. If you really dig this sound you might love it even more. Either way, it didnt stand out in my head as all that amazing, but its a decently made song.<br /><br />Now we come what i think is MetallicA's most underrated song of all time.<br />That song?  \\"Mama Said\\"<br />\\"Mama said\\" could of been a great metal song if it wanted to be, but it took a more western path instead, and delivers a powerful and great song still that showcases some of james best vocals. This is one of my top favorite songs from LOAD, and from Metallica, period. Its an inspired song that moves you. telling a tale. A must listen. Great stuff that stands with MetallicAs up with other great unforgettable MetallicA songs.<br />Though sadly its very overlooked , but that makes it all the more special. Its like finding gold in a mountain somewhere no one cared to look.<br />Great stuff.<br /><br />\\"Thorn Within\\" continues the quality song craft. This song is as dark as anything sung by James on the Black Album but in more hard rock mode, but its still very heavy and dark. Memorable lyrics. Memorable song. One of the better songs offered on Load.<br /><br />\\"Ronnie\\"<br />Now heres another one of those songs you have to be patient with lol. It tells a story of a kid who i think grew up being ridiculed and finds revenge in a way thats not really all that nice. When the chorus sings \\"...Now they all pray!...Blood stain wash away!!\\" , you get the idea. And i think that chorus is the highlight of the song. The song as whole is allright, definatly takes a lot of listens probubly to really get into. But ill tell you what. MetallicA created their own sound here with Load....you cant really put your finger on the sound. Its got blues, its got hard rock, with a splash of alterntive rock.....who makes this kinda music? NO ONE. just MetallicA did, and it was pretty damn good. Even when songs like this were one of those more \\"acquired taste\\" lol.<br /><br />\\"The Outlaw Torn\\" is a lumbering, dark, epic song. James sounds great here. Very good lyrics. Raw real emotion was pumped into this song, you can feel it. One of the more dark songs on the album. A great closer to a very good album. It one of MetallicA's longest songs clocking at 9 minutes and 48 seconds. Its a bit progressive, heavy , and laid back, but all together dark and cold as a desert at midnight.<br /><br />This might not be as speedy as past 80s work by this band or as utterly heavy, but the songs are so good that i didnt even really notice, i forgot about it, the songs were that infectious and well done, ya cant help but like this album. Its still very much MetallicA in the end ,just matured and with a bit more grooves.<br /><br />The LOAD album seems to have aged very well, like strong whiskey.er drive and turn it into a speed metal song...but to no avail lol. ( Just go pop in the Black Album if you start getting sentimental ) Again, not a bad song. just not extremely special.    \\"Poor Twisted Me\\" is another acquired taste.

1576754227|2.0|I wanted very much to like this book.  Normally I will read an excellent book cover to cover only taking time off to eat, sleep, and go to work.    A good book I will typically read a chapter a day, every day.  Although this book has some decent advice, it is a very dry read.  I have had for over a month now and am only a third through it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|If your looking for \\"Ride the Master of Justice\\" well, this isn't it.  Ive never pulled any punches when being critical of anything Metallica has put out, and I have never sugarcoated so this is a trully unbiased opinion.  The black album was, and still is depending on what radio station you lisen to, overplayed and really not that great, (the best songs were the ones that never got any airplay). \\"Load/ReLoad\\" I never even bought until ten years after it came out I got \\"Load\\" and complained because I had to pay $10 for a used copy. And lets not forget \\"St. Anger\\" or actually lets, It actually made think the band should go back to \\"Load\\" style at least the music is semi-quality, Im just glad they dident have Robert Turillio in the band yet to soil his reputation.  So now on to \\"Death Magnetic\\" Bob Rock is thankfully gone and replaced by the mighty Rick Rubin the producer behind every Slayer album since \\"Reign in Blood\\" and the first 4 Danzig albums! As mentioned earlier there is a new bass player in the band, Robert Turillio, formerly w/Ozzy and Suicidal Tendencies, so for these two reasons I was actually looking forward to this album, as I had never looked forward to a Metallica release before in my life.  First off the good: the first four songs are great, and \\"All Nightmare Long\\" might actually be my all time favorite Metallica song ever, seriously. Now the not as good as the good: After \\"Nightmare\\" comes #6 Cyanide not a terrible song but it dosent really stand up with the first 5 songs and this is the only song where the new bassist gets to show himself off and he dosent really, anyone familiar with Suicidal Tendencies and Infectious Grooves knows he is as talented as they come but no where on this record do we see what he's trually capable of. But I guess if these are my biggest complaints then Metallica is doing pretty well.  All in all this is a release that is both quality and heavy it would have been a great follow up to \\"Black\\" if it had been a follow up.If you like the old stuff this wont dissapoint but \\"Kill em All II\\" it is not.

B001DPC52C|5.0|I recieved my long awaited copy of Within Temptation's \\"Black Symphony\\" today. This concert is simply fantastic! WT, The Pa'dam Choir, and the Metropole Orchestra provide a feast for the senses the likes of which I've never experienced. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I assure you I am not. If this live DVD doesn't get them world wide acclaim, then nothing will. Sharon den Adel is absolutely stunning and an unbelievable talent. Her voice absolutely soars to incredible registers and is unwaivering over the two hour event. The rest of the band forms a very cohesive unit and their playing is flawless as always. The Metropole Orchestra and Pa'dam Choir make this an even more spectacular event. Nothing can compare to having them live on stage with the band. Recordings would just not have been the same. I won't describe the entire concert here. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I will say I highly recommend this CD/DVD to everyone. Five stars hands down. Go out and get it!!

1401207529|5.0|If you are a fan on the Batman movies, the comics, or the batman mythos at all then this book is a must read. I have always been a fan of the batman series since I can remember. This book offers a great history of the caped crusader. Not only does it introduce the hero of the story but a few of the major supporting characters and how they came to be. It really shows how far gotham has fallen into corruption and crime. It is a very good read.
031606792X|5.0|Sure the romance level is good, but you can't have THAT much of it or it gets really old. Of all of the books in the series, this definately has the right amount of action, vamp powers, cool stuff, and, yes, the romance that makes this a luv story. However, she should hav made 2 more books about what happens AFTER what seems to be the end. She could have made books about challenging and destroying Volturi, who takes over then, etc. However, she is the writer, and unlike the many discouraging articles about the \\"destroyed moral,\\" the romantics were not destroyed and it all got better as this 700pager went along.    EITHER WAY, READ IT! +), =), =P
0375424474|5.0|As interesting and informative as other reviewers have promised it to be.  If one is a Creationist however, you will not like this book.
1423113497|5.0|totally awesome books. they just get better and better in the series, and you will think they are too short. it is really cool to see how this author merges greek mythology and modern day society in the books.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Love this version. Really enjoy the developing relationship between Rochester and Jane. Excellent acting. Excellent locations.
0452289963|3.0|Although Tolle put his finger on something important, namely that our ego has too much influence over our lives, he pushes this to an extreme where our ego becomes our worst enemy.<br /><br />Living an egoless awaken life may be an interesting goal for an introverted childless man battling depression, as Tolle admitted he was, but it is not realistic for a parent with three children.<br /><br />Read the Book of Secrets by Deepak Chopra instead. With Chopra, spirituality is not a quick fix to all personal and global problems but a layered process where you don't have to wage a holy war within yourself to deny a fundamental part of who you are, your ego.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book! It was engaging and an easy read but hard to put down. It drew me in and I wanted to know more and more about these people from Guernsey. Their struggle during the Second World War which included the triumphs and tragedies.<br /><br />I am passing this book on to my sister and daughter to read. Also recommended it to my friends.
0375826726|5.0|Here is my review:  Christopher Paolini is an accomplished fantasy author.  I loved this book and I'm glad he wrote it.  Many of us may whine and moan about the direction his story is taking, but when it comes right down to it, it's his story.  He has stated from the get go that he started writing these books because he wanted to read something he would enjoy.  Well I hope he has enjoyed it as much as I have.      This book is a welcome addition to the story in my opinion.
B0010358CQ|4.0|Only the action is over the top.  But it's 'just' a cartoon, so that's OK, right?<br /><br />Visually, \\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" is overwhelming in detail, design, and in the illusion of camera movement.  The city scapes are so detailed you'd think they were rendered from photos of real urban environments.  Textures of fabric and surfaces are incredible, only a small step from photo realistic.  Only human skin is visibly simplified, consistant with the anim&eacute; aesthetic.  The opening sequence was set in what appeared to be the cathedral in Koln, Germany, down to the gothic detailing in the buttresses and the stained-glass windows, except you'd never be able to film that kind of action there.  The sci-fi gadgets were equally well done, mostly with a very plausible and appropriate feel.  Pulling in Prada to design costumes for the animation was innovative, and added another layer of depth to the cartoon.<br /><br />Yeah, the action was over the top.  Noted.  It was no more extreme than 'Matrix', despite having less limits than a photography type movie.  Still, it was appropriate to the medium and plot.<br /><br />The complexity of the story, the relationships, the character flaws, and depth of the characters pushes out of the Saturday morning league, and past the level of many conventional films.  There is a mixture of flaws, tensions, caring, and bravado entirely fitting the story, but well done.  In the story, there are several layers from a chaste romance between colleagues, questions of trust and loyalty at many levels, to international power games.<br /><br />I don't normally hold anim&eacute; in high esteem, but \\"Appleseed Ex Machina\\" exceeded all expectations.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court<br /><br />P.S.  Nice analog watches.<br />  V
B000HA4WT8|5.0|Unless the movie show many strange behavior about the Japan culture, the director make a great rescue in the Fast & Furios sequel.<br />Great CGI and photo shoot work, make this work to enjoy a good action movie.<br /><br />The bonus in the DVD, show a good work and have complete material to learn the tricks than they use to film the movie.<br /><br />I'm particularly like, because is not the clasic mafia, war action movie. Is about the cars and the speed. Noting more.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Maybe anybody could PLAY the president but only Giamatti and Linney can play John Adams and Abigail Adams better than anyone.  What I love most about this film is how satisfying this story is--intelligent with great dialogue, stellar first-rate acting, realism, action, passion, sacrifice, love.  This film is one of the most intelligent work brought to screen that I've seen in quite awhile.  For example, did you know the white house was built on the backs of slaves or how violent tarring and feathering a person can be? Kudos to Tom Hanks, HBO, Kirk Ellis for bringing the \\"sexy\\" back into our founding fathers and creating such a vivid and organic work amendable to the 21st audience.  History is sexy and riveting at the same time.
0374531269|5.0|I found the book to be very interesting and revealing of what young boys who are forced to kill others must do to survive. I had never realized what they go through and the rehabilitation they need to cope with their feelings afterward. To lose their parents first and then experience the need to run for their lives gives us as free citizens the appreciation of the freedoms we enjoy.

0446402389|5.0|Child 44 - I have a taste for a good epic fantasy novels such as \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, \\"The Name of the Wind\\", \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" etc. I needed something crude, thrilling. So one day I decided to find different sort of reading and that's when I came across Child 44, the first novel written by Mr. Tom Smith.    Let me be clear about this. You will be entertained. A great thriller, good plot and fast rhythm.     I'm the first to admit that I don't know NOTHING about the former Soviet Union and their Security Agencies. But Mr. Smith did a hell of a job describing a rare atmosphere, a place where you cannot trust even your wife, neighbor, friend or co-workers. A place where you are guilt, period. You don't even need to know what are you guilt of. A place where you need to play the blame game and betrayal hides on every corner, all in the name of Mother Country.    Add a serial killer to the mix, performing brutal killings upon children all over the country. Add a wife who doesn't love you at all, or does she? A co-worker agent that want to see you suffer at all cost. Now betrayed, you lost all that you have gained thru blind \\"work\\" for a cruel regime that you believe is correct. Then, with no gain at sight or hope of survival, try to resolve these misterious murders while being chased with high chances to get shot, arrested, tortured and or simply killed by your former colleagues.     All of these ingridients will have one result: CHILD 44.    Extremely well written book. As a result you will turn pages like a maniac.    A great read.    Cheers.
0975991477|5.0|This is a very quick read and easy to understand.  Bruce Lipton not only unlocks the door to a new consciousness, but opens the door and turns on the lights.
160459201X|5.0|I am a psychologist and a 'dyed in the wool' Freudian one at that so I don't recognize \\"subconscious\\" as a legitimate name for a mind function.  For me there is conscious and unconscious, the unconscious part coming into my recognition as a very legitimate, active and powerful force.  The following thumnail sketch will explain.    About five years ago I had to undergo a surgical rebuilding of my right hand as the result of a condition called teno-synovitis.  This disease causes rigidity and shortening of the tendons that allow the hand to grasp and relax in its healthy state.  Rather than operate normally both my right and left hands had closed into tight fists.  A long surgery had cut and freed the tendons of my right hand so that eventually I regained function once again.  Then the time came for surgery on my left hand.  That night before the operation I sat in front of a log fire and sipped a glass of red wine as I contemplated the ordeal that lay ahead. The wine and the fire had a soporofic effect and I fell asleep.  When I awoke in a short while my left hand for whom the surgery was scheduled was as free and flexible as the day I was born.  And it still is so.    I hadn't asked for this to happen and I certainly didn't recite any prayer.  I am thoroughly appalled at the perfidy of religion in all its forms and I am quick to identify and shun any attempt to rope me into its incredulous beliefs.       But what's going on here???  Something incredible happened that I do not understand.  I'm no mental slouch and if I don't know neither do I know, within scientific certainty, anyone who does.  But if Joseph Murphy wants to tell me what works for him . . . I'll listen.  He's welcome to his religious point of view but I'm not sure that's what he's proffering. I'm sure enough of my own mental (conscious) prowess to read what he has to say and pick out what I want. You never know.  I might, at least, find a point of reference.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I was very satisfied with the overall transaction.  The DVD was sent in a very timely matter and packaged in a way that it would not get damaged.

Thanks again a very please customer.
B00000IQW3|4.0|The Music Man and his video game - but it's more, just a test ! Pre Star Trek spinoffs are stale this is the beginning, straight \\" country boy does good\\" plot extended to the stars. Yeah - I've done time in \\"Trailer Parks \\" ( Caravan Parks in Aussie ) and I wanted out and up too ! I lost my video game edge when I got specs, but watching this flick is 'living a dream' - escapism. Just enough woman trouble to fill in the touchy feely side of the universe too ! I must admit they stole the mask for the Friendly alien Grigg - and reused it as the Grinch ! OK for fun, escapism, and lots of wishful dreaming - watch it !
B0000844I8|5.0|Chevron 7 locked. Come with me through the Stargate, anywhere, any era, any genre ! This movie was the beginning, a new concept and story, fun and hidden taunts at social mores, which eventually extended into TV as SG-1, & Atlantis. The Ultimate Version seemed to make a little more sense than the original flick, but then hindsight is always 20-20 ! Daniel Jackson is a different type of Nerd, but 'makes good' in this star-breaking introduction. Sci-Fi concepts are often novel and mostly plausible extensions of current scientific options or opinions, and  for the touchy-feelies out there, just enough boy-girl frames to fill the gap !
B00136S0NE|5.0|If i could sing, i would want to sing like Glen H.  He sings like his life depends on it... like he really means it. I like his stuff with the frames, but i love this.  Not all of the songs are great on this CD, but it makes it better if you have seen the movie.  The good songs on here are so good though, i would give this CD six stars if i could.  \\"Falling Slowly\\"  \\"When your mind's made up\\"  \\"Leave\\" etc.  Buy this now!
B0018OAPAW|5.0|I had been waiting for this cd for almost 5 years.  That is an eternity when your second favorite (after Bad Religion) band takes that long to release their next album.  I love all of The Offspring's cds, and I had incredibly high expectations for this, and they were met.  The ONLY problem I have with this cd (and their last) is they are just too short.  Granted, this one is 10 minutes longer than \\"Splinter,\\" and it's not unusual for punk cd's to clock in at 30 minutes or even less, but I was just hoping that after 5 years they could put together 45 or 50 minutes.   But hey, if that's your only complaint, maybe that just means it's so good that it seems to fly by and you simply don't want it to end.  The first half of the album is pretty fast-paced and then slows down.  But the slow songs are also incredible, with the exception of \\"Fix You,\\" which I unfortunately would have to say is the Offspring's worst song ever.  I usually skip that track, and I can't say that about any other Offspring song on any other record (actually maybe \\"Denial, Revisited\\" from Conspiracy of One too).    But other than that, you have your standard fast Offspring melodic rock and roll, with Dexter's voice sounding better than ever at 42.  If you liked Offspring's previous records you should definitely like this one.  I can't wait for the next one to come out in 2019.
031606792X|5.0|This makes up for the very poor book 3 in this series.  Well done with the ending and giving us something to cheer about!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I felt the the music from Mamma Mia, was uplifting, and fun.  The fact the actors sang their owns songs was outstanding.  Were they all good singers no, but who cares! They gave it their  best and made the music special.  I love Abba!

B001GAPC1K|5.0|Not a review but a question. What exactly is the difference between this BR and the other Iron Man BR that's no longer available? Thanks.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was amazing! I loved it from the very beginning to the very end. Both sides, the werewolves and the vampires, won in the end and Bella even got a daughter. The most surprising twist was Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter Renesmee. Didn't see that one coming! And Bella's power was pretty cool.I somewhat expected this power but that made it no less interesting. I liked the fact that she added other covens and that some of those vampires had special powers, which were also neat. I can't wait for Stephenie Meyer to finish Midnight Sun or whatever other books she is working on. I definitely recommend this book!
B001FEA9QU|5.0|Wow is all I can say.  If I could give this album 6 stars I would.  Metallica has returned to their roots of blistering guitar and crushing speed metal that could only be perfected by Metallica.  After hearing Death Magnetic I would even say this is their best album since ...And Justice For All.  The riffs are spun out and rocked hard very similar to Justice with the song sensibility of Kill Em All.  You will notice that the drawn out 7-8 minute riffage of songs is featured here again like the classic symphony-like metal of 'Justice'.  And in case you were wondering, there are still fresh new guitar riffs left and they are here on this album.  Better yet, Kirk Hammett's signature lightning quick guitar solos are back, which seemed to be few and far between since Load was released.  have done away with the de-tuned, slow, mid-tempo approach of their last 3 albums.  This album is much tighter sounding and brings back the sound we (Metallica fans that is) have all fallen in love with.  Bottom line is, if you've been waiting to hear the \\"old\\" Metallica again in a new way, BUY this album!! (respect Metallica's wishes and don't obtain it illegally)  As a fan that grew up listening to 'Justice' and 'Puppets', I can't rave about this enough.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I don't think anyone really expected much of this 16 year old girl when they heard she was going to be side by side with the Jonas Brothers for the huge Disney success, Camp Rock.  Boy, were those people proven wrong.    Quite personally, I've found most Disney stars entertaining, but never vocally talented.  Demi took the stereotype of Disney stars and literally smashed it.    With her extremely mature debut album, Demi Lovato has exemplified that talent runs in all ages.  Even more impressive?  She co-wrote most of the album, except for two, \\"Until You're Mine\\" and \\"The Middle\\".    Although most of the tracks were co-written with teen bombshells Jonas Brothers, one of the most ear pleasing tracks is one she wrote by herself entitled \\"Trainwreck\\".  All the uptempo songs have a unique sense of fun, and each ballad is filled with heartfelt and personal lyrics.  In the title track, \\"Don't Forget\\", you can cut the emotional tension with a knife.    The boys also come in for a great duet, which pretty much laid out every teenage breakup in a matter of 3 minutes and 26 seconds.    My personal favorites?  Trainwreck, La La Land, On The Line, and Until You're Mine.  =]    I suggest you try this album out, especially if you're a Disney fan.  It will definitely redefine how you view \\"Disney stars\\".
B000002MT0|5.0|For those 'fans' out there (yeah you, 'Dr. Mo') need to shut their mouths about Prince releasing 'Contractual obligations'.  Pretty much the only album that Prince released to fulfill a contract would be 'Chaos And Disorder'.  Do people just not think that Prince doesn't want to release music?  He is a musician after all.  This album is great, and if you don't like, you probably are a fan of Purple Rain, and not Prince.<br /><br />Prince goes all out in experimentation, lyrically, musically, and visually (visually as in the image of Prince standing before a cemetery, a very powerful idea).  The lyrics and theme are very explicit, yes, but Prince pulls it off in such unique artistic quality that I doubt any other musician can do.  Behind every track is an underlining emotion of what Prince has always been about.<br /><br />Tracks like 'Papa', 'Loose!', and the A Capella-like 'Solo' are all unique pieces to Prince's usually music, but don't stray too far from what you hear on, say, the New Power Generation album.<br /><br />Now, if Prince had to release some music for an album, do you think he would really care about trying so hard to create such a strong atmosphere and style?  Each track is a masterpiece that I can listen to over and over.  Often I enjoy repeating the entire album right through, because I can't get enough.  I would even go so far as to consider almost all of these tracks as my favorite Prince songs, especially 'Papa', 'Letitgo', 'Loose!', 'Pheromone'... well, I'm not going to list all of them.
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|I'd add \\"meets 28 Days Later\\" to the title, but that would be an insult to 28 days.    Wow. I can't believe this movie got so many rave reviews. Maybe it would be useful if the reviews included the reviewers age.     To even mention Blade Runner in context with this movie is a joke.    We both fell asleep, twice!    They don't make movies like they used to, thats for sure.    I wish I too could fight evil by pointing my forehead and issuing a \\"shockwave\\".    Look for my copy to turn up soon, cheap.    If you're an adult, best to skip this excersize in stupidity.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|i have been awaiting for this movie to come out for 2 decades! i have been a fan of Iron Man since the learned to read comics! I really enjoyed the \\"other\\" version i watched this move in. However i knew this would be a definite Bluray addition to my Marvel Bluray universe.  I actually had gotten eh Sound track first and was just too excited about the movie.<br /><br />I felt Robert Jr. really came through and the role of Tony Stark just fitted him like a glove. Well done!  the story of course is sort of leading up to something just like the incredible Hulk.  But definitely a must have bluray for any HD and comics fan!

B000IFQLLY|4.0|DM have gone through many distinct phases since their inception at the beginning of the 1980's.  This compilation CD, while not \\"perfect\\" by the standards of serious fanatics--how could it be?--is a good place to start when you're just trying to get a feel for the band's sound.<br /><br />Unlike the two singles compilations released in 1998, the tracks here are sequenced to showcase the band's diverse history rather than a chronological progression.  \\"Personal Jesus\\" was not DM's first single, but it did become their most recognizable hit of all time.  It also grandfathered a series of songs that pay homage to it later in the band's career.  Try listening to the bluesy guitar riff in \\"Jesus\\" and then \\"I Feel You,\\" \\"Dream On,\\" \\"Suffer Well,\\" and \\"Martyr.\\"  The lineage should be clear even to casual listeners.<br /><br />But there are of course other strains of Depeche Mode, and that's why \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" is such a shock when sequenced back to back with \\"Personal Jesus.\\"  Who knew that the same band was capable of bouncy bubble gum pop on the one hand, and a monument to God, Elvis, and Kraftwerk on the other? That's the trick to Depeche Mode: it lies somewhere between Johnny Cash and A-ha, biblical allusion and trendy disposability, tortured guitars and Moog synthesizers.  No wonder many people don't really know what to think about this band.  There are identifiable waypoints along this tangled path: try sequencing the sincerity of \\"See You\\" and the menace of \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" between those polar opposites, and maybe you get something close to a straight line from point A to B.<br /><br />For a while DM was about pushing the buttons of the BBC.  Nowadays, when a song about being bi-curious hits number one on the charts, \\"Master and Servant\\" might seem quite acceptably deviant.  But in 1984 it was a kind of firebomb tossed on pop music, and when you consider other politically- and culturally-charged salvos of the time such as \\"Everything Counts,\\" \\"People Are People,\\" and \\"Strangelove,\\" you can see why Depeche Mode has sometimes been synonymous with subversion.<br /><br />But when all is said and done, what might be best about Depeche Mode is its pensiveness, its navel-gazing, its proclivity for being romantic and emotionally distant at the same time.  Hence \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and \\"Shake the Disease.\\"  \\"I'm not going down on my knees,\\" Martin Gore writes, \\"begging you to adore me.\\"  And he still manages to come off as hopelessly in love and terrified of being hopelessly out of love all over again.  Which leads quite naturally to the pained confessions of weakness and defeat in \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" and \\"Precious.\\"  It's never cut and dried, never direct and easy for this band when it comes to attachments, and that's a big part of its lasting appeal.<br /><br />There aren't many acts in music that can display such longevity and varied success in its catalogue, but Depeche Mode is one of them.  And that's the story this disc tells as effectively as it realistically could in less than eighty minutes.ngelove,\\" you can see why Depeche Mode has sometimes been synonymous with subversion.

B001DJ69E8|5.0|As other reviewers have noted; the track names appear to have been confused on the mp3 release.  (the same has occurred at E-music)  The iTunes release does not seem to have this problem.   The correct track names should be:    #  TITLE IS: =============== TITLE SHOULD BE:  1. Prometheus Rising ========= Prometheus Rising  2. An Epic Age ============= Fides en Lucius Dei  3. Lacrimosa Dominae ======== Shield of Faith  4. Serenata Immortale ======== Onward to Freedom  5. Imperitum ============== Empyrean Mercenaries  6. Trial of the Archangel ======= Generations  7. Prelude to Paradise ======== Age of Discovery  8. The Reluctant Warrior ======= An Epic Age  9. Spiritus Omnia =========== Lacrimosa Dominae  10. Fides en Lucius Dei ======= Serenata Immortale  11. Shield of Earth ========== Imperitum  12. Onward to Freedom ======= Trial of the Archangel  13. Empyrean Mercenaries ===== Prelude to Paradise  14. Generations ============ The Reluctant Warrior  15. Age of Discovery ========= Spiritus Omnia    That administrative glitch aside, this is a highly anticipated, powerful and splendidly produced album.    In essence, these are all fresh, high-quality recordings of Immediate Music's signature tracks from their \\"Themes for Orchestra and Choir\\" compilations.  From Lucius Dei to Serenata, they're all there, in their pure, rousing, and epic orchestral form.    The electronic underscore is strong, the orchestration aggressive, and the choral re-recordings (from a 70-piece choir, no less) all come across as well-staged, imbuing the rising thematic chords with the necessary gravitas.    There are a couple of surprises here and there (a guitar solo during Serenata Immortale!) and a few new gems have made the cut (eg. Prometheus Rising & Generations) so there's plenty of fun for aficionados as well as new fans.    If you enjoy epic score, Globus' \\"Epicon\\" album, or if you have obtained Immediate Music's work in the past by - ahem - shall we say 'less than reputable means', then buy this album without hesitation - you owe them!!
B000089J0R|4.0|I was quite surprised by the songs on this album considering that I bought it along with Ultra Beatdown.  It is certainly not as diverse as their three other albums ahead, but it has a nice level of originality that can only be found on this album.  Dragonforce put together a good one for their first release.  If you like Dragonforce and want the whole collection, you won't be wasting money on this gem.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Great album by a great band.  Aside from Pearl Jam, these guys are the best rock band around, IMO.  Every song on the album is good, but my favorites are Manhattan, Cold Desert, Revelry and Notion.  Can't wait to see 'em play live next time they're in Atlanta.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched every single episode and extra from the seasons and then saw this movie in the theatre the thursday night it came out at midnight. It was a great ending to the movie and I was so happy with how everything went. The first person to comment on this site should know #1 it's a movie meant for entertaining and true sex and the city fans loved it, those who didn't should probably become film critics because we know they have no taste. They did product placement advertisements because, the show had major buys periodically throughout the each season, never having to buy a billion designer items for one episode. This movie was full of designer dudes and filmed at loads of locations and no movie set is prepared to fork over that much money. It's cheaper to do product placement and get free stuff that way.     Secondly, the ROTTENTOMATOS site is made and has movies reviewed by a bunch of overweight lunatics who wouldn't know good movies if it bit them in the arse. Sitting on your couch drinks Jolt and eating cheetos while watching every movie ever made does not make you a \\"professional\\" as you called them.    This movie was great and people who loved the show will love how everything was concluded. There are sad parts and happy parts and you will laugh and cry. This is the perfect movie to watch with a group of your girls while sippin martinis and having a fun night in.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|At first listen I was slightly disappointed. This album really feels mellow and slow. But the more I listened to it the more I began to like it and now begin to love it. It is nothing close to the first two A++ Albums, but is better then their third. The vocalist(sorry im not good with name)sounds better then he ever has and the drummer is just amazing. the guitarist is doing his own creative thing as always and the bassist works around the other 3. This album is much softer and slower then the other 3 and the Kings will never soung as raw as they did when they began, but if your a true kings fan pick this up and open your ears. Give it a little time and I believe this album will grow on ya. I give it 8.3 out of 10 and is well worth the 10 bucks.

0385340990|5.0|I found out about this the best way - from a reader with great taste who enthused about it.<br /><br />Two things would have put me off without this lead - I'm not a great fan of epistolary books and the title sounds 'twee.' However the letters and story strands work brilliantly together, providing as strong an incentive as any conventional plot to keep the reader on the book like a barnacle.<br /><br />This book combines information, energy and charm.
B00005RIKI|4.0|Ok maybe not 3 steps but maybe 3 lines to write a review.  THis is like an early Greatest hits album because it is so good.  I wish I could have seen the original band together.  But this album has lived on for many years after their passing.  I think it is well worth purchasing; or you could just try to catch some of these tunes on your local classic rock station.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|This BBC documentary tells the story of how on August 4, 1974 Philippe Petit (b. 1949) danced, sat, knelt and lay down on a tight rope that was strung between the two towers of the World Trade Center. The stunt lasted 45 minutes, during which time he traversed the cable eight times. Since we know when the film begins where it will end and what it's about, the plot consists of retelling the secret logistics, dumb luck, and extraordinary skill of the team that Petit assembled. The directors incorporate archival footage, still photos, re-enactments, and lengthy interviews with the team members. As is fitting, Petit himself narrates most of his own story. Why did he do it? That, he says, is a quintessentially American question. Bravery and skill, yes, but also joy and beauty. And how did they secure the 450-pound cable 200 feet between the two towers? Watch this fascinating film, which is based on Petit's book To Reach the Clouds (2002).
B001DHXT1G|5.0|i have to say this movie was a thrill ride winner.the last hulk movie was absolute rubbish in every way from acting to the script to the cgi ect....hence i gave up on this franchise but boy was i impressed with this movie.what summer fun.as i am a huge fan of the comic genre and such pop culture i have to give this film 5 stars.edward norton was believable as the green giant and all refferences to the original cartoon series were here and lou ferrigno's cameo didn't hurt either.hope they make another one soon as the ending left room aplent for a sequel.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Hello, Back in the 80's I saw the original showing on TV of this and tried to buy a video of it without success. This year is tha Anniversary of West Side Story and I just wondered if maybe ther was a DVD of it. Of course, here it is. West Side Story was what gave me my love of musicals and in my opinion it has never been surpassed and Leonard Bernstein is the tru Maestro- so charismatic as are all of the participants. A must see.
031606792X|5.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend and she loved it. Probably a little too much. She wouldn't put it down. I lost a little time with her, but gained a lot of points for it. Definite must read if you like vampires and werewolves at all!
B000002KY8|5.0|For some reason when I woke this morning I had this tune in my head and couldn't rest till I traipsed down to the basement and found the old LP.  What a difference from today when you can play all 10 tracks on the CD without switching or changing the record, but back then I never heard the songs on side 2--and never played the second disc on the double-LP, not ever, didn't see any point to changing up from the first 2 tracks.  Why did artists make such long LPs, why not just collect a few perfect tracks?  And thus it wasn't until today that I would up hearing \\"International Lover\\" and \\"Free\\" and the other songs (some of them not so great) on the \\"second disc\\" of the double LP--well, that dates me, but I expect at this time in Prince's career most of his fans are those who, like me, remember the 1980s as if they were yesterday and a time when 1999 seemed a zillion light years away, and when Wendy and Lisa puzzled us with their odd, superior androgyny like a pair of aloof Claude Cahuns, always nodding to the same beat, thrusting out their chins in unison, ten tons of hairspray making them look sort of feminine.<br /><br />That's not to say that today's Prince fans love what used to be sides one and two, tbree and four with equal fervor, how could they?  They won't even remember the exquisitely perverse take on \\"Little Red Corvette\\" that Sandra Bernhard gave in her concert film \\"Without You I'm Nothing,\\" her unsuccessful attempt to divert 80s energy into 90s irony.<br /><br />Vanity's on this CD too, which I did not realize in the 1980s, but that's because I never heard \\"Free,\\" in which her vocals ring out loud and clear.  That's not such a good thing.
0740748475|4.0|The product was wonderful; it was everything he ever dreamed it would be.  However, it came with a dent in one of the corners which fortunately didn't damage the books, only the collector's box that they come in.  Packaging during shipping could have been better.  Other than that they are WONDERFUL!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Like most others, I eagerly anticipated the release of ST:TMP during the late 70s and was disappointed.    No longer.    The Director's Cut restores more even pacing to a story that is rather simple on the surface [think The Changeling Part II] but has multiple layers and a depth of complexity that no other movie in the franchise could hope to touch.    Have no doubts- if you're looking for fast paced action, well-developed characters or chemistry from the Big Three [Kirk, Spock, McCoy] look elsewhere.    But if you want a movie that discusses big issues in a serious way then you won't do better than Star Trek the Motion Picture.  Consciousness, the meaning of life, religion and even love are addressed in extremely subtle ways that make this movie the most \\"adult\\" franchise science fiction movie out there and is far more in the spirit of 2001: A Space Odyssey than say Star Wars for example.    Highly recommended.
014303961X|4.0|\\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" is one of the most (brutally) honest portrayals of love and intimacy in 20th century literature.  Turning away from the flowery and the poetic sentiments of many other writers, Lawrence completely de-romanticizes romance and shows it as something visceral and almost beastial.  Written during the span between the first and second World Wars, when industrialization and mechanization seemed to threaten the essence of humanity, Constance Chatterly can, I think, be seen as an Every-Wo/man character searching for intimacy in a society that was increasingly cold and cerebral.  Is it possible to love someone when you are alienated from everyone around you?  Can you feel passion when you are nothing more than a cog in the gears of some great machine?  These are the central questions asked by Lawrence in this novel and of course they are still relevant today.    While \\"Chatterly\\" may not be considered Lawrence's best work, it is still a great book and definitely worth reading.  Of course, this novel has flaws - notably the characterization of Mellors, and also the very abrupt ending - but Lawrence's beautiful language (minus the various 4 letter words that appear throughout the text) and his keen understanding of humanity make this work really great.  Read this book and consider the romantic relationships in your life and I'm sure you will have a lot to think about.
0066620996|5.0|I don't need much to write here as hundreds of people has written review for this book.  In simple terms the book is easy to read & understand. Analyze how best companies manage to retain their position by innovative & intelligent leadership. Research is sound & findings are really interesting. This book would be useful for any leader (or follower) even if they are not into financial sector.  The concept of \\"Good is the enemy of Great\\" struck me the most  Definitely worth for its price.
1596912375|5.0|I could not not put  this book down . It is a spy story with meanings on many levels. For example what do we really know about our friends and even our close relatives? What is truth and what is illusion? Appearances do not always reflect reality. A great writer. I highly recommend it. A great read.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|BACK IN BLACK was my favorite cd of the last two years. so i wanted to go back and hear how our amy sounded before. its not as stylized its a bit looser but the two cd set is chock full of incredible performances lots of great originals that are not particularly in the style of BIB but still noteworthy and on the second cd there are some exquisite remakes of some amazing standards and some interesting remixes of songs from the first cd. the booklet is full of pictures of a beautiful young  healthy woman. what a talent. what a shame if we lose her.
1573229725|5.0|A female Oliver Twist story with a Lesbian sub plot. This is an interesting  fictional account of a female orphan reared by thieves (fingersmiths) . It takes place in 1844 in London and is sexually explicit in a way a Dickens novel could  never be. Well researched and wonderfully written.
0375826726|3.0|Ah for the good old days of the first two books. The characters were less interested in pondering the morals of every action and more interested in acting. I will try not to reference the events of the books for those who enjoy shouting \\"spoiler\\".    I have read lots of people saying that the writing has improved in this, the third book, but I can not see how this is so when there is so much disappointment with the almost different style of writing. I was honestly horrified that the book seemed to move away from a great story to a more educated and philosophical view on the interactions of all the races. You can see it everywhere, Nasuada, the dwarves, Eragon, the elves....everywhere. The STORY used to be the focus of this series, and once the story takes over, the book is interesting and wonderful. Overall I was greatly disappointed in this highly anticipated sequel.    In addition to the majority of the book being an endless series of talking about problems, the book shifts a lot of focus onto Roran. Some people may like this others may not. The fact is that Paolini could make Roran the new king at the end of the series if he wishes. However, in this book the endless building up of Roran seems to detract from the overall storyline.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a transfixing, thrilling read.<br /> The Hunger Games is a novel revolving around a yearly mandatory event known as the \\"hunger games.\\" These games serve as a reminder that the districts must do as the Capitol demands. Children chosen to participate in the games range in age from 12-18 and are decided at the \\"reaping,\\" a district occurrence where names are called at random. Each district has to send one boy and one girl as a competitor in the games.  Only one person can survive the game which consists of a battle to the death. The trials and tribulations of the children, or \\"tributes,\\" are many; from gathering food, water, shelter and most importantly staying alive.<br />Two protagonists, Katniss and Peeta are two contenders that will have your heart and keep you reading fast and furious to see the outcome.<br />No interruptions will be tolerated because not only is the plot engrossing but the characters are endearing, people whom you'd like as friends. There is some violence in this book but nothing too explicit or too bloody.<br />Waiting for the second book will surely necessitate discovery of some top notch authors!
B0013LPS8E|5.0|When it comes to a band like U2, it's always hard to say which period is \\"classic U2\\". Well I feel the War album was the last of the raw, new wave, earthy, rock sound that is very melodic and completed with the Edge's unique guitar style. You can really hear Adam and Larry contributing for sure. It has a much different sound than Boy and October, but it also stands in it's own catagory. New Years Day, Sunday Bloody Sunday, and Surrender are my favorites but then again I love the whole album....This is a cd to complete your U2 collection for sure!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This diminutive little fellow is an outstanding performer.  Not high-powered, but fully capable of meeting the needs of most amateur photographers -- much more power than built-in flashes with the very valuable bounce-flash that built-ins lack.    When I bought it, I knew it was \\"compact\\" but I was still surprized at its very small profile.  Very much easier to carry along than typical automatic flashes.  I only wish it were available in a version (slave version)that could be used on other brand cameras.    All-in-all, Ideal for me and many other amateurs.

0743290119|3.0|Easy beach read, but summer is now over. The story of three 30 something girlfriends in Manhatten looking for the perfect relationship. It reads like a script of \\"Sex in the City\\".

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I was glad to be able to have closure to the TV series Firefly! Joss Whedon scores a touch down with me once again. All I have to hear is his name associated with a project, and I get right on board with having to see it! If you are not a fan of his, you should be!!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I expected something crazy and dark (coming from Tim Burton previous movies). I was wonderfully impressed but how meaningful this movie is. Tim Burton taps into the common problem with children and their parents not understanding each other. He beautifully shows how the son of a very imaginative man, doesn't not have a good relationship with his father because he doesn't believe his father's tales of his life. Unfortunately, his father is dying and he goes to see him before he dies. I don't want to give too much of the movie out because i think it is too beautiful to give away. However it is not a easy movie to understand for some you have to look at the detail of the plot to really grasp it. Open your mind and you will not be dissatisfied.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss is totally under-rated and so was this show. I love him, and any show he does and am excited to be waiting for another show of his from Fox in January 2009 to start! If you love odd and unusual and are bored with the same old stuff on TV, just start looking into the stuff Joss puts out.
B000002HMH|5.0|After recently buyin Death Magnetic and being very impressed , i decided to buy Load, one of Metallica,s albums i,d passed up on due to bad reviews , Hmm big mistake , this is absolutly brilliant imo , not really thrash more hard rock , maybe this is why many gave it a low score ? tracks like , Bleeding Me ,Aint My [...], House Jack Built ,Hero Of The Day, Poor Twisted Me ..er ok all of them make it a very enjoyable listen. Just not too impressed how the cover art was made , an i always thought they were a painting of flames lol.   A good album to wind down to at the end of a hard day.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Many people reviewing this movie seem to suffer from \\"Star Wars Syndrome\\" -- in other words, the originals were beyond reproach and the new ones were so woefully bad that a team of chimps could have written better stories. In fact, ANYONE could have done better! Nothing good about the new movies - not one thing.    But the ORIGINALS -- why, they were written, directed and produced by God himself, so flawless were they! It's amazing how Lucas was able to pull off three flawless Star Wars films (with the possible exception of Ewoks), and yet he can do nothing right today.    And so it goes with Indiana Jones. Blah, blah, blah.    People have criticized the plot device in this movie. They can't quite come to terms with such a \\"supernatural element.\\" But the original movies -- why, they were just fine! The opening of the ark? The worship service in the Temple of Doom (removing beating hearts, anyone)? The healing power of the Holy Grail? No problem. In fact, we see it every day. But ALIENS -- can't quite stomach that, even though they were all over pop culture in the fifties and fit in well with the period.    This movie, instead of just making stuff up, follows the structure of the first three films. It incorporates many supernatural elements with which we are acquainted-- crystal skulls, UFOs, Nazca lines in Peru, Area 51, and even the legendary El Dorado. Everything fits in nicely, though the plot is a bit more convoluted than the first three films.    When did so many people stop enjoying movies and resort to being so critical? I imagine if this had been the first breakthrough movie, made in 1981, and \\"Raiders\\" was the new 2008 film, it would be criticized beyond reason:    \\"'Raiders' is just more of the same. The plot was non-existent; Indy had to find a headpiece that would point him to the location of the ark by using the sun's rays. For some reason he's able to simply escape from an underground chamber full of CGI snakes after being sealed up, ostensibly for alleternity. At one point Indy goes underneath a truck going 50 mph and gets back on to fight! And at the end of the movie all credibility was lost when they opened the ark and the bad guys were destroyed -- what a cop-out! Aside from the relationship between Indy and Marion, the characters were poorly-drawn, one-dimensional caricatures -- especially the cartoon Nazis. Lucas has lost it and Spielberg has seen better days.\\"    You see?     In fact, before this movie was released I asked a friend if he was planning to see it. The reply: \\"I don't think so. Been there, done that.\\" As if, after nearly twenty years, one more movie was just too much to handle. Amazing! This same person probably hasn't missed a single Bond movie in the same twenty years (talk about \\"been there, done that\\")!    Take the criticisms with a grain of salt. This movie was made for one reason -- public demand. There are four elements that make a good Indiana Jones movie: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford and John Williams. Lucas's plot is better than anything I -- or any of the other critics -- could have plausibly come up with. Spielberg's direction is great (though not spectacular, as in \\"Raiders\\"). Harrison Ford is fantastically fit -- in fact, were it not for the grey hair, he hardly looks much older than he did during \\"Last Crusade.\\" And John Williams's eerie score is excellent as always. This movie fits in well, in tone and in feel, with the other movies and is a worthy successor. Is it as good? I'd say it's at least as good or better than \\"Temple of Doom.\\" But that's the point -- it doesn't have to be -- it's its own movie, designed to entertain and nothing more.     This movie was thoroughly entertaining to me; I'm glad I can still enjoy movies without being overly critical. I recognize it for what it is -- just a fun movie. That's all it is. Not the Second Coming.     See this movie. Enjoy. Welcome back, Indiana Jones!
9626344369|4.0|To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \\"nice\\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes.  Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it.
0307269752|5.0|To think I almost put this down.  Around page 160, I started to think that though I thought the writing was solid, and I liked the characters, nothing was really happening.  I read a bit further.  And then I found myself grudging the fact that I had to stop reading.  And as the conclusion approached, I grew less and less willing to read the final pages -- even as I couldn't stop reading.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is why we read.  Gripping. Horrifying.  Thoughtful.  Beautiful.  The sort of book to recommend to friends.  The sort of book to proudly read before most folks.  One of the best books  I have read this year.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love it.  I've been doing this for four weeks now.  Haven't been able to do it every day, I've been taking the weekends off.  It makes a difference if you really do it.  In 20 minutes I work up a crazy sweat and felt great.  Definitely recommend the video.

B001C3KCSY|2.0|....but it IS boring.     Starts off well enough but after Use Somebody it's all very samey. A bunch of nondescript mid-tempo bland songs, nothing really standing out. They got a formula for this album and almost every song follows it, no fire or energy.    2 stars because of songs 2/3/4, other than that - forgettable.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|After only a few reviewed listens, I was quite impressed with the   plethora of elements that Judas Priest conjured up for their latest effort on Nostradamus!     An impressive twist of the tale steping back and forward into man's longtime evilution. It explores the sins of the fathers gone by right up to today's society still riding the waves of time and mankind's uncertain future? Nostradamus shows another realm of Priest exploring their own creative concept filled with mysterious soundscapes, midtempo melodies, and synphonic drama mixed into their trademark hard & heavy metal domain! There are many standout songs including the intro./Dawn of Creation, The Phophecy, Revelations, Plague & Pestilence, Sands Of Time, Persecution, Visions, the Title track, and the album finale/etc..!    If your looking for another start to finish metal effort, this one is simply a slight departure into areas that many metal acts have explored before. You have black metal rockers like Dimmu Borgir/etc..using dramatic, airey orchestrations, Newer bands like Iced Earth who always seems to explore newer adventures in darker concept music writing. And now, the Beast that is Priest have done their concept Nostradamus! It's definitely worth a LISTEN & then some! These Metal Masters from Great Britian really deliver energetic passion, pleasure, and pain twisting another dimension into the Metallion! Great showing all around by Rob, Glenn, K.K., Ian, & Scott! Go on now, go get it!
0374531269|5.0|This is not a book for the faint of heart. It's descriptions at times are so graphic, so realistic, it is if you are their beside the characters enduring the fate that awaits. It is very well written.  I easily became engrossed and didn't want to put it down, although i was honestly disappointed with the ending, finishing all too soon with not enough information to satisfy.    I have no trouble recommending this book to others, knowing they will take something away from the heart moving read. Matter of fact i have brought copies already and have given them as gifts, with one friend saying it was awesome, and is up their as one of the best books he has read.  Don't pass it up, READ NOW!! and i can only hope you will be motivated to want more for the youth of the world.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|STOP SCREAMING ! Okay, this has got to be one of THE grossest movies I've ever seen. Radha Mitchell screams and shouts enough times in this flick for 10 horror movies. Great special effects, and that dude with the GIGANTIC knife was pretty darn scary. If this movie was based on a video game, I'd hate to play that game. And I thought watching my son playing \\"Bioshock\\" was scary.<br /><br />Great film adaption, script writing, acting, direction and special effects. Radha Mitchell's performance is on par with her part in Vin Diesel's  \\"Pitch Black\\" (and she was good in Pitch Black). I just voted this movie as one of my all-time favorite horror flicks (SE7EN, Silence of the Lambs, etc). Very cool. Geez, I hope I never hear another air-raid siren again.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Originally reviewed for my blog  [...]    All I can say is that the album is very, very good. I'm not sure I can gush over it like some of the critics have, specifically the ones that say it is his greatest work since mid-period Zeppelin, or since Physical Graffiti, mainly because I love Presence and In Through the Out Door. However, I can safely say that it is better than Dreamland and it approaches the greatness of 1993's Fate of Nations. I don't necessarily like to compare works by the same artist. It's really purely subjective. I'm sure that 1983's Principle of Moments was very good for its time, but it may not possess the same resonance today as it might have then, especially among younger listeners. I guess I can say that virtually all Zeppelin sounds timeless to me, while some of the group's former members have produced albums that now sound somewhat dated, even if I can still appreciate them. On some songs, Mighty Rearranger has been infused with some electronica in addition to its rock and African rhythms, and in time the electronica may sound to us the same way 80s synthesizers sound to us today. For an album of this time, it's really good. Lyrically, I believe it's just as good as his best, on Fate of Nations, if not better.    \\"Another Tribe\\" starts the album. The vocals are definitely mixed to the front. The main instrument is the percussion, with some string accompaniment. The lyrics may refer to tolerance for other people's beliefs and/or culture:    \\"I think there may be a war in heaven  Paradise beneath the smoking gun  As every saint and small town saviour  Race to justify their chosen one  I wonder, as our world collides  I want to reach out there  Across the great divide\\"    \\"Shine It All Around\\" is the first single, and it's been out for a while. It features the big, pronounced drum beat and great bass line. The vocals are echoed in some places, and the guitar is nice and crunchy. This is a great pop song, and probably the wisest choice for thefirst single. The lyrics pertain to famine relief (\\"break a little bread now, share it all around...\\"). There's a nice short solo about three minutes in.    \\"Freedom Fries\\" - a pretty funky number, North African drum intro with the vocals coming in next, and then the bass and guitar. The lyrics are just great to this one. There's an excellent guitar solo on the \\"outro.\\" Here are some of the lyrics again:    \\"Billy the Kid told the Prince of Thieves,  A little give and take to satisfy my needs  You can give me lots but I'll take some more  I got my eyes on your treasure beneath the desert floor  Freedom fries and burns and scars  The liberator goes too far\\"    \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" is next. This song has an electronica-flavored introduction with almost whispered vocals, bass and drum accompaniment. There's just a great rhythm to this track with excellent phrasing. There's a degree of irony to the lyrics given Mr. Plant's appearance on two late-night shows this week [May 2005] ...It is not until Robert yells, \\"Like THIS!\\" that the guitar really kicks in and he unleashes some of those trademark wails. Then the understated vocals return for another round until...\\"like THIS\\" everything explodes again.    Again, some lyrics:    \\"I come from Tin Pan Valley and I'm moving right along  I live on former glory, so long ago and gone  I'm turning down the talk shows, the humour and the couch  I'm moving up to higher ground, I've found a new way out.  There's parasols and barbeques and loungers by the pool  The late night conversations filled with 20th century cool  My peers may flirt with cabaret, some fake the rebel yell  Me - I'm moving up to higher ground, I must escape this hell...\\"    Next up is a really nice acoustic ballad called \\"All The King's Horses\\" that features some great picking from Skin Tyson. There's an electric guitar in the background. Sounds like Plant's vocals are doubled on the repetition of the song's title in a couple spots, which has a nice effect. There's avery fluid solo in the middle portion. This is a good campfire kind of love song.    \\"All the Kings horses, all the Kings men  I'll weave a circle round the sun  Throw down my arms and give my all  I'll be your soldier of love\\"    Track six is \\"The Enchanter\\" that has a very sensual groove to it. The drum and bass work very well together, and the guitar is serpentine in nature. There are some electronic effects, but they're in the background and do not compete with the huge backbeat and swirling guitar. If it was up to me, I would have made this song the first single.  There is what some have described as a \\"rave-like fade out,\\" and this is true to a certain extent, but I think it works within the song. In addition to the effects, there's Justin Adams on the bongo and a simple keyboard line repeated over again with a little bass. This is one of the best tracks, and it's undoubtedly about a provocative female. If the last song was wholesome, this one hints at the passion underneath.    \\"Takamba\\" follows, and this begins with some muted guitar and some clapping before the rest of the band enters and blows everything up. This has one of the best introductions. Plant declares, \\"Sing a song of freedom, write it in the sky. Pocket full of secrets, belly-full of lies...tricks and mirrors, sleight of hand - promised land.\\" The lyrics look to be a bash of Prime Minister Blair's decision to lead the UK to war alongside the US in Iraq. A very strong song.    \\"Dancing in Heaven\\" sounds like a corny title, but this song is really quite good. Prominently featured is Skin's acoustic guitar once again, gently supported by the rest of the band and strong vocals from Robert. Nice solo, likely from Skin - and good bass work from Billy Fuller. There's a nice groove to this track.    \\"Somebody Knocking\\" - if you read my blog regularly, you'll realize that I already panned this song more than a month ago. I've tried to listen to it since then, and while it has grown on me a bit, it's still not my favorite. In the context of the album, it fits well enough. The instrumentation is somewhat rambling, but Plant's vocals definitely sound better on the CD than they did in the mp3 I've had for weeks now. The lyrics on this song are the weakest of the whole album, mostly blues cliches and variations on that theme set incongruously to North African instrumentation.    \\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\" made its live debut at the Myrtle Beach show I saw in late March [2005]. This track is similar to \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" in a way, there is a good rhythm and groove coupled with great phrasing on Plant's part. The vocals may be stronger on this track. The whole song has a kind of sauntering stride to it, a mixture of quiet confidence and with just a little bit of aggression that removes any doubt that the song rocks. More great work from the whole band and standout guitar from both Skin and Justin Adams. There is quite a bit that sounds similar to \\"If I Ever Get Lucky\\" from Dreamland and from Justin Adams' solo CD, Desert Road.    \\"Mighty Rearranger\\": The title track has a lot of the swing of the last track. The vocals are mixed a bit oddly here, with the effect of having them sound somewhat hollow with a bit of echo. The song sounds a bit tinny before the rhythm section steps in, and even then, there's something not quite right. The live version from Texas I've heard sounded superior to the album version. That said, there's some nice harmonica here from Plant.    \\"Brother Ray\\" is not much of a song. It's more like a piece of a jam that was somewhat obviously tacked on to the album as an afterthought, or as a hastily-arranged tribute to Ray Charles, or both. It sounds like everyone in the band picked up whatever instrument happened to be around them and started playing. There are no actual lyrics, just a series of \\"ooh\\" and \\"ahhh, yeah\\" repetitions from Plant. The whole thing lasts just over a minute before a few seconds of silence and then the remix of \\"Shine it All Around.\\" I've heard the bonus track on the Japanese pressing, \\"Red, White, and Blue\\" and would have preferred that, either in place of the remix or \\"Brother Ray.\\" I think RWB is really good. Remixes are for singles, not for albums, in my opinion.
B00005MCX0|4.0|Hawkwind is a band that I never got into back in the day, but when I found out they were playing the North East Art Rock festival that I would be attending a few years ago, I decided to check out some of their stuff......and I liked what I heard.  These guys are the prototype space rock / science fiction rock band and would influence pretty much every band of that genre that came after them.  The lineup for Hawkwind seemed to always be in a state of flux with Dave Brock the only person to appear on every album.  \\"In Search Of Space\\" starts out with the 15 minute \\"You Shouldn't Do That\\" which people either love or loathe.  It is archetype stoner rock that drones on and on over a grove laid down by the drummer.  I pretty much hated it the first time I heard it, but has grown on me over time to where I enjoy it now.  Other highlights include \\"Master Of The Universe\\", and \\"We Took The Wrong Step Years ago\\".  This is good solid early Hawkwind.
0739367676|4.0|Whew....I just finished listening to the audio version of Breaking Dawn (Book 4 of the Twilight Saga). I am a big fan of the audios for this series; the reader is terrific.<br /><br />I'm not going to comment on anything specific in the book. I loved the way the book began, and I found some parts were pretty intense. I thought the author did a good job bringing the loose ends together at the end. There was no way that Meyer was going to please all her readers with this book.<br /><br />Personally, I am happy that the series has ended, as after this one I feel pretty \\"vampired-out\\". If you were a fan of the first (3) books, and you have not yet read Breaking Dawn, I recommend you do so; I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|...well, in my opinion. Other than when they used to show real videos and shows about real music, of course. Of all the non-music related shows MTV has created (and there are way too many), this was their best.  We need this on DVD. Please, it has been six years since the last Daria movie. It's time, Viacom/MTV!!!
0974869449|4.0|On the White Rabbit Kana cards, they provide nifty mneumonics for each of the symbols.  (These are memory devices to help you remember the symbol).  While the features of the Kanji cards are nice, mneumonics would have *really* been useful.  If the Tuttle--or any other brand--have mneumonics, I suggest you give them a look.  The mneumonics on the White Rabbit Kana cards had a *significant* impact on my ability to memorize them.    To compensate, I have Tuttle's \\"Remembering the Japanese Characters\\" (or something like that--I may have misremembered the title), which I strongly recommend.  For each character they provide a breif historical analysis and mneumonic.  I use Tuttle's book to learn the symbols and the cards to practice.  The only headache is that the book and the cards are not in the same order--White Rabbit uses the JPT ordering while Tuttle uses the ordering taught in Japanese elementary school--so I have to order the cards myself.    Still a good product and I'm happy with it.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Remember how awful \\"Insurrection\\" was? Well, \\"Nemesis\\" is kind of relief from that! It's nowhere near as inane, talky and bland as THAT cinematic TNG installment was, but you STILL wonder where the rest of the movie is! There are no \\"hooks\\" in this movie....! Nothing GRABS you like it should, like the better TNG TV eps like \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" or \\"Contagion\\" did. (And wouldn't the movies have been a great medium to further delve into THAT unfinished story??)<br /><br />Picard has a clone within the Romulan empire. Big hairy deal! There's a double of ANOTHER major character in the film, too! One of the things that always p****d me off about the TNG show was the lazy writer's device of making yet another \\"double character\\" episode! They almost ALWAYS stank after the first use of this device!<br /><br />The film opens up on Rolmulus...(btw, the Romulan throne city exteriors look JUST like they did on TV...like obvious miniatures.) And we are witness to what amounts to the reverse of what happened to Julius Caesar, with Romulan senators killed off within the first five minutes. THEN the intrigue starts in earnest!<br /><br />What might bother you in this movie is: Why is Earth never actually threatened? Or Vulcan? Or the Klingons? This all pretty much stays in the Romulan system, well away from the doorsteps of the classic Romulan enemies. Just think of the tension that being in the Terran, Klingon or Vulcan systems would have engendered vis a vis the Romulans against the full bore complement of Federation or Klingon fleets! And forgive me, but Tom Hardy's portrayal of Picard's clone just wasn't over-the-top villainous enough for my tastes! He was TOO muted and just doesn't seem like that much of a threat! Anybody who plays villains ought to be forced to watch a few movies starring Rutger Hauer or Richard Lynch as the bad guys, since these guys pretty much wrote the book on truly evil acting in movies of the last 30 years.<br /><br />And yes, we lose good old Data in this one, but don't despair....! There's a ready-made replacement for him in B-4, who, I GUARANTEE you, has probably had a chip implanted in him already that will bring him up to Data's speed eventually in future stories, (probably as TV movies,) of the TNG crew.<br /><br />While this is MUCH better than \\"Insurrection\\" as a movie, it STILL feels too much like a less than truly stellar TV episode, \\"Insurrection\\"'s biggest fault.<br /><br />Least ways, it's STILL better than \\"Enterprise\\"! ;-).!

B0017MO10U|4.0|It is pretty good, but I feel like the SG1 TV show was better then the movies and would have rather had another season then two films.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|5 years ago was a dark time for Metallica. The band almost broke up and their latest album, St.Anger, was very dissapointing. I was at a point where I beleived Metallica would never release anything worthy again.So fast forward five years later and I hear Metallica is coming out with another album. My expectations were very low. From the bootleg samples I heard it sounded like another St.Anger and then I heard the single \\"The Day that never comes.\\" My first thought was \\"ok but not great.\\" So I still wasn't pumped for the new Metallica album.<br /><br />Then I finally heard Death Magnetic and I was very surprised. It had the great riffs, solos, and attitude that older Metallica had and when I say older I mean the Load albums. This is nowhere near as good as the golden years but it still rocks. That bad taste in my mouth that was St.Anger is gone and Death Magnetic is a great surprise.<br /><br />Best Songs: Broken,Beat & Scarred, Cyanide, and The Judas Kiss
B00004Y6O9|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! One of rock's outstanding debuts that ranks in the top 20 debuts ever. Eddie Van Halen stunned the world with his incredible leads & there weren't too many better front men than David Lee Roth. Though the album only peaked at #19, it's not indicative of the quality of this album. There were two singles from the album that charted: \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\" (#84) & \\"You Really Got Me\\" (#36). Once again, the performance of the singles doesn't give the proper credit to the band.    The album opens with \\"Runnin' With the Devil\\" which showcases the talent of Eddie Van Halen. Van Halen knew how to give us hard rock with a very keen perception of pop & concise songs; rarely, if ever, did their studio recorded songs ramble without direction. \\"Eruption\\" is an instrumental that features Eddie's incredible solo ability. \\"Eruption\\" segues into their incredible cover of a Kinks song, \\"You Really Got Me\\". It's a rare thing when I like a cover version better than the original but Van Halen makes this song their very own. Van Halen's background harmonies are among the best since the Beatles. \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\" is one of the best songs on the album, one of their best songs in their entire catalog. Like most Van Halen songs in the Roth era, Diamond Dave's personality oozes throughout the vocals. \\"I'm the One\\" opens with Eddie's absolutely smoking a lead, if you haven't been convinced by now just how good he is then you never will be. This is the kind of song that literally invented pop-metal. The band shines in the a capella scat vocals toward the end of the song. \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\", though not a bad song, hints at filler but it's good filler. \\"Atomic Punk\\" cranks up the guitar quotient(GQ), it's better than the previous song if only because of Eddie's performance on lead. \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" exhibits Van Halen's combination of pop & rock that made them instant stars. You can hear the influence of the Beatles in their music when they drop in the 'woo'! \\"Little Dreamer\\" is one of the mellower songs on the album, yet they still rock. Even going into a minor key Eddie gives ample proof he knows his way around a guitar. It's one of his most tasteful & melodic leads on the album. \\"Ice Cream Man\\" is the second cover song on the album &, once again, they turn it into their own. Written by a great but underrated blues artist, John Brim.  Dave's personality is a dominant feature of the song. David Lee might never be recognized as a great vocalists but he's extremely talented. \\"on Fire\\" is the closing song of the album, with it's appropriate title, the band cooks & smokes its way through the song.    Van Halen surprised the world with this dynamic release, certainly one of the most original of albums. The sound quality is excellent but the booklet doesn't offer anything. I'm not sure if the band could ever top this album but they certainly equaled it on at least two more occasions. Enjoy pop-metal at its very best.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I really like the series and I'm sorry to see it end. But I think season 6 was one of the most imaginative seasons Starge SG-1 had! I was really tired of Michael Shanks running in/out and the addition of Corin Nemec was refreshing.   Especially since most of all the seasons consisted of them going to a planet where everybody always looked the SAME!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This cd is awesome. First cd ive bought in a while because i download music instead. Went to her concert and she's great so i had to get the cd and i dont regret it. Its so worth it and has a great listing of songs including her hits \\"i kissed a girl\\" and newest single \\"hot and cold\\" if you dont have this cd, get it because it rocks!
B000002U9Y|5.0|It's important to keep in perspective  when albums are released and the culture from which they arise. Reviewers who knock this album as being uneven -especially when compared to their later work- are missing the point.<br /><br />This music was of it's time and very inspiring to the young music enthusiast of the late 60's. I would still rate the title track, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" as one of the most psychedelic songs of all time. \\"Let There be More Light\\" is wonderful if for nothing else than the opening base line by Roger; but it also has that soaring Gilmore vocal line on the hook, and of course the spacey ending. Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun will always be a classic Floyd song from the early daze. Corporal Clegg was actually an underground FM radio favorite back then in my hometown (Kansas City), and while it was never my favorite, it definitely has it's own charm- an early Water's composition.<br /><br />The post Syd band was experimenting with sound and atmosphere, and more often than not, they succeeded. This is a classic album from this period and a must for any self respecting Floyd-O-Phile. Recommended for any fan of late 60's psychedelic/ underground art rock.
032147404X|5.0|Very clear and concise solutions for clearly described special and not so special situation. Warning: it made me order a lot of extra equipment in order to try out many of the same things the author describes. You will learn a lot of tricks and develop a closer personal relationship to your photographic equipment. The time I spend with mine has increased dangerously. Highly recommended.
B00007E8PE|5.0|Great record.  Had to return twice though due to poor packaging which resulted in damage to the record.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This is an absolute, outstanding RS concert ever on DVD. I was amazed with this concert due to excellent performances not only by Rod but to other guest performers. The crisp sound on my 5.1 HT system is great and also the picture quality is perfect. With regard to the seller, I don't encounter any problem. Hence, I always give a high rating to any seller/ merchant that meets or exceeded my expectations. Thanks so much Amazon!
0596007124|5.0|First, a little background: I have been programming since 1998 and my primary programming language is C#. My main area of development is ASP.NET websites.    For years I have been trying to get my head around software design patterns, but I kept running into road blocks. I tried learning about them from a combination of websites and books, but none of them seemed to communicate the practical reasons for learning design patterns. I decided to give up on learning them.    Several years went by and the gnawing question about the usefulness of software design patterns resurfaced in my head. I came across Head First Design Patterns, saw the great reviews and decided to take a chance. I am sure glad I did.    Not only is this easily the best design patterns book I have read, this may be one of the best books, teaching a complicated technology topic, I have ever read. This book was created with me in mind. The book is educational, entertaining, and does a good job of showing the practical side of the topic. The examples are all in Java, but I was able to easily translate them into C#.    If you want to learn object oriented design patterns, buy this book. I will definitely be checking out other Head First titles.
B00003CXRM|5.0|O Brother... has one of the best sound tracks ever, if you like blue grass music.  It's sound track is a classic.  Not only that but the story line is a great one too.  It's funny and entertaining.  I highly recommend it!
0375826726|1.0|Christopher Paolini is often marketed on trivial things about him as a person, such as how he was 15 when he started to writing the series, but what has become quite clear with Brisingr, the third book in what was suposed to be a trilogy (and has been proven by brisingr, should have reminds a trilogy)lacks the skill to handle a long series.    Brisingr is best discribed as 600 pages of nothing, leading to 150 pages of something. The First 600 pages of this book contains practically no value, and adds nothing to the series as a whole. It moves without feeling or meaning, and is nothing more then overly verborse filler. aside from the first three chapters of the book, which actually move the story along, from that point on, until around page 600, nothing really happens but random events that seem rarely to add to the plot of the book, but simply drags the reader through murky half battles, and lots of traveling.    The reason I am giving this book a one star rating is because it lacks story. by the time you get to page 600, you are met with a repeat of a previous plot that was used in a earlier book, which was lifted from a Star Wars in the first place, and in the second time in the series when he uses this Star Wars ripoff, it is tireing, and annoying. Sure, it gives a nice little confidence boost to eragon, but at the cost of repreditive use of dirivative plotting already used by Paolini in the series.    he follows it with a J.K. Rowlingesque plot device that was fresh and engaging when J.K. Rowling used it, and even though Paolini introduces a similer concept, with a few vague differences, the sheer numbers he utilizes to make his point is in my personal opinion to be massive overkill. J.K. Rowling understood that less is more, and Paolini seems to think why do a handful when you can do a vaultfull.    what follows is some more traveling, and I do not belive it to be a spoiler to speak of a battle, simply because he already made the battle clear to readers monthsago, and it is expect. The problem however is that the turning tide of the battle in Brisingr is nothing more then a repeat of the turning point in a previous battle Paolini has written already. instead of useing a more inventive and unused within his world twist, he regurgitated something he has done before. the effect is to make it seem he just wasnt to be bothered coming up with something new.    in the end, with 600 pages of fluff in a 750 page book, I can see how this book could have been easily condensed to about 400 pages without dramatically changing anything about the story other then the length of the book.    ultimately, this will now leave a haze of questions over Paolini, the most prominate being if he really split the final book into two parts for money? or if he split it up for art? given the lack of plot in this book, and the incredibly length for something with such little value, and further unoriginality on his part, I am leaning towards it being a matter of money.    Did Paolini feel he would be a one hit wonder, and wanted to make sure he spread it out enough to squeeze as much as he could. with the failure that was the film (mainly due to the inability of the scriptwriter and film studio to make a legitimate translation that doesnt cut out all the important parts in haste to make a FX jubiliee.) I could see Paolini wanting to make up for the money he thought he should have gotten from the film.    all I know for sure, this book did not earn praise. it copies to much, drags on to long without anything of value, and lacks the ammount of plot of even most 300 page fantasies such as harry potter and the Sorcerer stone. when a 300 page book written for a younger audience has more to give to its readers then a 750 page book written for teenagers, then you have to question the authors motives.
B001GAPC1K|1.0|Beware this version of the disc will not play on the majority of Sony or Samsung BluRay systems. Paramount issued a recall of all discs recently, with a replacement due out soon.    No word from Amazon about this.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I own 3 SB-800s and I shoot weddings. So far none of SB-800s have quit on me. They are real workhorses. I bought the Sb-900 because i like the ease of switching it from being a regular flash to a master control in a quick flick. If you use this function a lot, it may be worth it to get the SB900. The $130 difference to me depends on how fast you use that function. In a wedding, you could set up some remote lights with your other nikon speedlights...and create some nice lighting. But sometime you want to turn these remotes on/off and it is a real hassle doing it withe the Sb800. Now, it takes less that second...which is essential in a wedding environment.   I read other comments about how their 900s overheated and shut down. I did not experience this for the 2 weddings i shot recently. However, since i'm shooting with a new D700 at ISO 400 - 800, i'm probably not working the 900 extremely hard. Overall, the flash seems to be working well, and apart from its size, i like it. The negatives: The controls needs a little getting used to and the flash case is a little too long too. If it was priced in the 3 hundreds...then it would be 5 star...for this price...it only gets 4 stars from me.
0375826726|2.0|I had great expectations form this part, in part because of the delay. However, I did not find the narrative enjoyable. The author spent too much time, words and pages on needless details that do not move the story along. There are long periods in the book when nothing happens, and then a few pages with crammed up action and then back to ho-hum.   The second thing I did not like about this book is that killing and fighting seems to be described in a little too much detail. I understand part of it needs to be present to make aware the dilemmas faced by Roran and Eragorn. However, there are pages where all that is described is how people were killing people. Ok, the story is about war and people are killing people. However, it seemed repetitive.   Third thing that I did not like is how Eragorn's behavior is described. I felt that there were many holes in Eragorn's treatment. I felt that there is a lot of things that as a person with that kind of responsibility he should be doing, but instead not doing like keeping the stones in his belt charged with energy, or asking Oromis about advanced magic to counter spells, or ask him about what the Ra'zac had said before dying (about Galbatorix's quest). Roran gets gored by a bull but forgets to tell Eragorn that his wards have a hole in them.   Of course I like the books and pay attention while reading them! :-) But I feel the narrative could have been much tighter while leading to the same result.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Although looking a lot like a Tag Heuer Aquaracer or Rolex Submariner (in that this is Invicta's version of a stainless divers chronograph) the timepiece doesn't cost nearly as much.  As such, it makes for a great daily wearer and travel buddy.  It's thick and somewhat heavy and feels very durable. I abuse this watch when I don't want to destroy or wear my Aquaracer in a pool or whatever.<br /><br />The stainless bracelet looks awesome and has recieved many compliments, strangely at airports more than anywhere else. The clasp is sturdy and secure and the dial is easy to read and clean. The Invicta logo has a passing resemblance to the Longines logo, which is kind of funny. The best part is that unlike other Invicta watches, which are huge embarrassing stadiums on your wrist, this one is of a sensible diameter and seems very classic.<br /><br />Your friends and family will never have to know you spent only a $120, instead of $700-800.<br /><br />It would be far awesomer if the bezel rotated, but it's not like I'm using the watch to fly a plane.  For the money, this is an admirable five star watch.
0765350386|3.0|Bottom Line: Try before you buy<br />So, I've never read Sanderson before, nor did I know about him finishing Jordan's (Wheel of Time series) last novel until after I had already bought the book.<br />Started the book, was very impressed with the world building, and thought the use of metals was an interesting twist of the use of magic.  But after a while, the book got kinda...boring, meaning it was taking forever to go anywhere that captured my attention...to the point I put the book down and left it there twice (almost wasn't going to pick up back up).<br />When I finally started reading again, I skimmed ahead and discovered the story got a lot better when Vin was sent to act as part of a House member, just took way to long to get her to that point..like FOREVER.  The book should have started there because it was the most interesting part of the story, and the part of the story where the real action begins, to me.  And the most interesting character, was really Vin.  She should have been the focus of the whole story, and her plight being caught up in Kelsier's war.  Most interesting relationship, was Vin and Elend. Too bad there wasn't a whole gosh darn darn more of them, and the tension between them weaved and dragged out in the story.<br />If you enjoy really detailed world building, and you don't mind the story being dragged out, then maybe you'll like this book.<br />If you need a little more action and movement in your stories, with a great character to follow, maybe pass on this one.<br />Lorna Freeman, E.E. Knight, Holly Lisle are much better for adventure fantasy.
031606792X|3.0|I enjoyed the first three books of the series, Twilight in particular, that opened up a world with so much promise. The obsessive teen lovey-dovey side made it the ultimate guilty pleasure, while still showing a somewhat unique take on vampire legend. Each book sucks you right in, with the exception of the final story, which I found tedious at times. I personally think Meyer loves her characters so much that she lost her grasp on the larger picture, altering her characters in an  attempt to tie everything together in a way that alienated a lot of fans. Bella's progression from book 1 to where she ended up in book 4 seems disjointed and unrealistic, even considering this is a world full of vampires. It almost felt like another author stepped in to finish the story. It's too bad; had Meyer done this one right she would have had an incredible series.
006082543X|4.0|I have to admit that most of my exposure to Gaiman is through the hands of other artists.  In fact my introduction to Gaiman was via Dave McKean.  While I did not read the printed version of \\"Coraline\\" the graphic edition caught my eye and I picked it up and found I could not put it down.  Russell's visual adaptation gave me enough to establish boundaries, but left enough open visually for the head to bring the pages to life.  I find interesting the genre of materials (books, movies, graphic novels, music) that are related through the eyes of children, but are best experienced by adults.  \\"Coraline\\" fits this mold well.  I watched Jan Svankmajer's \\"Little Oti\\" last night--I would place that in this pool as well.
B00151HZME|5.0|I listened to this all summer and never tired of it. It's fun, beautiful and lush. This is my first M83 album, and while I liked the '80s slant, I'm ecstatic to see they have a darker edge. I'm about to order everything else they've put out. I've been bored with music for awhile and this one woke me up.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is an outstanding archival history of down-south backwoods blues, containing performances by legendary blues musicians, along with collaborations with Kennny Wayne Sheperd, Chris Layton and Tommmy Shannon  (both from Stevie Ray Vaunghn's \\"Double Trouble\\"). This is a 5 star classic blues documentary and performance DVD. It was named DVD of the year 2007, by the Blues Foundation in Memphis, TN. The performances were filmed throughout the south, on site at homes, front yards, BBQ's, a church and even a cemetary. The DVD was produced by Jerry Harrison, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and former member of the \\"Talking Heads\\".    It begins in New Orleans, with a performance of \\"Tina Marie\\" with Bryan Lee, and then a performance of \\"Born in Louisiana\\" with \\"GateMouth\\" Brown.  Then there is a performance of \\"Honey Tonk\\" with Buddy Flett filmed near Shreveport,LA at Morningport LA at the gravesite of the legendary \\"Leadbelly\\". Then its off to a BBQ in Indianola,MS the home town of B.B. King for a performance of \\"the Thrill is Gone\\". The blues journey continues to Gadsden, Al for a performance of \\"Potato Patch\\" by Jerry \\"Boogie\\" McCain. He plays great harmonica music!    Next, the blues journey is in North Carolina, the land of the Piedmont Blues, with a perfomance of \\"Prison Blues\\" with Cootie Stark and Neal   Pattman. Next, a performance of \\"Chapel Hill Boogie\\" with John Dee Holeman. Then, a performance of \\"U-Haul\\" with Cootie Stark. This a greart blues number, its about \\"I've searched and searched but I ain't never seen a U-Haul trailer behind a herse\\". There is a performance of \\"Knoxville Rag\\" with Etta Baker in her home. She speaks of the Peidmont Blues as being a \\"happier kinda blues\\".    The journey continues to St.Louis, where you get an interview with Henry Townsend. He actually played with the legendary Robert Johnson. He was originally from the Mississippi Delta. There is also an interview with Honeyboy Edwards, he was actually with Robert Johnson when he died.    Then its on to a \\"Blues\\" Church in Salina, KS, for a performance with Hubert Sumlin on guitar (Howling Wolf taught him to play without a pick),  also, George \\"Wild Child\\" Butler (of \\"Wolf's band) plays harmonica, and Henry Gray (of Wolf's band) plays piano and sings \\"Little Red Rooster\\". Next, the group plays \\"Spoonful\\". Then there's a performance of \\"Grindin Man\\" featuring \\"Pinetop Perkins\\" on piano and vocals and other members of \\"Muddy Waters' band. Then a performance of \\"Got my MoJo Working\\" by the same group.    The Dvd concludes with a summation by Kenny Wayne Sheperd along with Jerry Harrison. There are bonus performances also. This is an outstanding piece of \\"blues\\" and \\"american music\\" history. It's a 5 Star Classic.

B00005N5S5|4.0|This is a great classic that is a staple in many personal movie collections. The action and suspense scenes are great. Of course, with the new computer technology out there some of the scenes look a little dated but that is some of the charm of Terminator.
0061537934|5.0|I didn't buy The Art of Racing in the Rain. It was given to me by a dear friend, who knew all too well the relationship I shared with my dog Boomerang, a beautiful yellow lab girl, who died in April at the age of 13. I was at first apprehensive to read it, since I thought it would be too painful, and now I wish I had read it sooner.   Enzo is a character (no pun intended) and wonderful narrator of the life he shares with his human pal Denny with all their trials and tribulations. If only more people could be like Enzo, who has a dry wit and deep desire to be human, as he thinks humans should be. Funny, dramatic and spiritual, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Thanks Enzo for your reminders about kindness, truthfulness and love.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Great movie, have watched many times over. Received it in a timely manner.    Thank you.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Enema of the State by Blink 182 made this pop/punk band a household name. In some ways, this album made them a little too popular and the music suffered after that. Adam's Song, All the Small Things, What's My Age Again?, and Wendy Clear are still pretty decent songs but the rest is just garbage. It's sad to hear about drummer Travis Barker, hope he has a speedy recovery but this cd is not in anyways memorable.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Movie condition was great, received it in a timely manner. Love the movie and have watched a few times already.
0671027344|5.0|This book is amazing. It's full of weird things, comedy, and of course some serious stuff. It has changed people's life but it my not change yours. I would recommend this to people 14 yrs. old and up. Also, anyone who has felt alone, scared, or just hasn't been able to fit in anywhere. What it's about is a boy named Charlie (that's not his real name. He doesn't use real ones) who is scared about going into high school. He meets a few people like Patrick and Sam. The story is full of suspense and comedy. It's is great.
B001DPC52C|1.0|All summer long I have been waiting for this live CD to hit. Correction the TWO disc version of this live set. So imagine my anger when I find out this \\"American version\\" is simply only 13 tracks from a 22 track live set and one of the two DVDs.     WTF! Where is \\"Memories\\" or \\"Ice Queen?\\" Nope, not there. It's also missing \\"The Heart of Everything,\\" \\"The Swan Song,\\" \\"The Other Half,\\" \\"The Promise,\\" \\"The Truth Behind the Rose,\\" \\"Deceiver of Fools,\\" and \\"All I Need.\\"    Europe and Japan get the 2-disc set? So what the WT fans on this side of the ocean can't get it (except on itunes apparently)? I would've gladly paid for the two disc version.     Screw this version, I'm going to just shill out the $40 it would take me to get the 2-disc 2-DVD version to get it shipped from Europe on Ebay. Or better yet I should just torrent the thing and not give Roadrunner Records any money for this con job.     *update* Ok so you CAN get the full concert on MP3 on Amazon MP3 (which I have), which is a benefit for people like me who don't want to pay itunes anything.     Let me state that this one star review is NOT at all a reflection of the music on this album, which is AWESOME.      I still stand by my one star review because if I want the DVD and the full concert on CD I would have to buy the CD/DVD and then buy the excluded songs on Amazon MP3...which is stupid, because that will cost me more and put the songs out of their original order.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Non-Al Green fans will listen to this CD and say the songs all sound like old Al Green songs and thus, they will be disappointed. Al Green fans will listen to this album and say it sounds like old Al Green and will be very pleased music. Well, let's just say I am an even bigger Al Green fan now.

B00127RAJY|5.0|To start with, I hate workout DVDs, I have the attention span of a fruit fly, and I was immediately skeptical of any 20-minute workout.  However, I figured all of the positive reviews had to mean something, so I gave this dvd a try, and it has given me results that I would never have expected.  I run about 3-5 miles a few times a week, but haven't done much strength training. I thought I was in reasonable shape, but even level one of this kicked my butt.    This DVD is effective because of the circuit training -- each section is so short that you know that if you keep at it, you'll be able to do it. Even if, for example, one of the strength training exercises is too hard for you, each one is at most a minute long, so you have incentive to do what you can and keep trying.  Some of the compound exercises in levels two and three were too hard for me at first, so I modified by doing each part alternately (like, do the squat, then do the bicep curl) until I could do them together.  I alternate the workouts so I don't get bored, and it's easy to mix things up by increasing the weights you use in workout one, or doing more reps, etc.    For what it's worth, I have gone down three jean sizes in the two months I've been doing this DVD, and my back doesn't hurt anymore.  There were parts of my body I didn't even realize were out of shape until I saw the changes from this workout.  This DVD has done more for my fitness and health than anything else I've ever tried.  Jillian is amazing.

B0017MO10U|4.0|Hi there   I am a Stargate fan but this film has several errors.  First I think the film gets off to a good start Baal captured and SG-1 ready to watch the last System lord be executed, then Vala disappears surely Baal would have to disappear first to change the timeline unless another Baal is still out there.  Second how did Baal defeat all the other System lords especially  Anubis as he had ascended over a thousand years ago as mentioned in the episode Summit.  The actor who played Ra looked nothing like the previous actor.
0345350472|4.0|Author, Philip K. Dick is best known for his substantial body of work in the science fiction genre.<br /><br />I became acquainted with DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP by viewing (several times) the now cult classic sci-fi film, BLADE RUNNER.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick has the talent for addressing and questioning the dualities of our existence.<br /><br />Born a twin, his sibling tragically died six weeks after their birth. This event and the emotional challenges of growing up in a conflicted family created the backdrop Dick's work.<br /><br />He did not consider himself so much a story teller as one who utilized plots to express his ideas.<br /><br />The dilemma presented in \\"Electric Sheep\\" which was translated onto the big screen in Blade Runner is:<br /><br />Can androids be human?<br /><br />The story explores how we humans treat species separate from ourselves. Enslaving androids who look, act and on some levels feel like humans... could this be right?<br /><br />Read the story to find out.<br /><br />Don't just rely on the film... \\"Electric Sheep\\" will take you on a page turning journey that veers from the script of Blade Runner.<br /><br />You will see the core concepts that have influenced so many current science fiction films. TOTAL RECALL and MINORITY REPORT (starring Tom Cruise) are both based on Dick's work.<br /><br />KERNEL OF WISDOM FROM THE BOOK:<br /><br />\\"He thought too about his need for a real animal; within him an actual hatred once manifested itself towards his electric sheep, which he had to tend, had to care about, as if it lived.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|Hi there   I am a Stargate fan but this film was a disappointment.  I had expected the end battle between SG-1 versus the Ori instead the replicators were the main threat to SG-1. The previously powerful Ori ships looked very weak with 4 of them attacking and doing almost no damage.  A almost dead Teal'c after being shot in the back crosses a mountain range in super speed and finds the city of the Ori.   Then the final battle Adria who has all the power the Ori once had does not even get into the film until the end where she is tricked and we are supposed to believe most of her power just disappears for her fight against one ancient. Which is a copy of Threads.   Looks good but storyline was bad with the extra time should have been better thought out.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is by far the best adaptation of the classic novel that I have ever seen! The first time that I saw this movie on A&E 10 years ago I fell in love with it before I had read the book. I was afraid to read the book at first because it has always been my experience that the books are always better than the movie versions they inspire. After reading the book I found my fears to be unfounded! This production is so close to the book that the majority of the dialogue is taken directly out of the text! The sets and costumes are absolutely gorgeous! Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle just sparkle together as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. In my humble opinion this is the only version of the story that is worth repeated viewings! It is one of my favorite movies ever!!!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. They show recreated reality as the producer sees it. Will the paying audience agree? Al Gore's anecdote about South America and Africa demonstrates the changing styles of science. Will today's beliefs become as obsolete as 18th century science? Gore says pollution causes global warming by trapping heat that would escape into space. Is carbon dioxide the sole cause? What if the output from the sun is increasing? What if the orbit of the earth is nearer to the sun? Gore explains his arguments. There was global warming during Medieval times. One difference is the higher level of CO2 compared to the estimates from the past. Gore predicts skyrocketing levels in 50 years. [If true, people will die off as during the Global Cooling of the 14th century and solve the problem until the next cycle.]    Gore said the ten hottest years of the past 2 centuries were in the past decades; the earth is warming up since the last Ice Age. The warmer oceans create bigger hurricanes. Was the New Orleans disaster of 2005 due in part to faulty engineering or politics? Gore lost the 2000 Presidential election because he didn't carry his home state of Tennessee. Was that due to his advocacy of NAFTA or the Gun Ban? Did people distrust Gore's judgment? Global warming causes both floods and droughts. Ocean and wind currents redistribute tropic heat. This film also advertises Al Gore as if he was running for office again. Gore explains the effects of earlier springs on increasing insects that adversely affect human life. Gore says the melting glaciers of Greenland can cause ocean levels to rise by 20 feet. This would devastate Florida, San Francisco, and other places because of the rise of the oceans. If that invisible shield keeps heat in wouldn't it also stop heat from the sun?    Could the world's population have tripled in 40 years? Wouldn't that require massive increases in food? Carbon emissions correlate to relative wealth of the countries. An urban legend (?) Of a frog in hot water is used as a warning. Gore's older sister smoked cigarettes and died of lung cancer. [Gore didn't explain this as caused by big corporations and their advertising.] The lack of articles questioning global warming could demonstrate censorship. Big corporations funded universities and direct research, its not just the White House that manipulates statistics. Gore failed to point out how Big Oil has rigged the laws to create high gasoline consumption. Just look at America before the 1950s when people shopped and worked at local small businesses and most did not own automobiles or air conditioners. \\"Are you ready to change the way you live?\\" [Are you, Senator Gore?] The film gives a number of suggestions to reduce energy consumption voluntarily. [Gore does not recommend nationalizing Big Oil to prevent further damage to the people and environment, as has happened since the 1940s. Countries like Mexico and Venezuela that nationalized their oil industries have low gas prices and energy independence.]
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Upon my first listen or two of Third, I didn't think it was that much of a progression from their debut, Dummy, nor their self-titled sophomore album. But I've come to realize I was ever so wrong.    The dark, sexy vibe that Portishead pulled off before is now just, well, dark. Extremely eerie, and very sinister. Their music used to sound like something you'd hear in a smoky and dingy underground club at 3 a.m. with others around smoking, talking, and maybe even dancing. Third sounds like something you'd listen to alone in a dark and musty basement of an abandoned building with one hanging light bulb flickering on and off.    There is definitely a Silver Apples influence here, and it makes me salivate. I love the Silver Apples, but Portishead takes their template and adds Beth's vocals and more developed songwriting, and creates something beyond anything the Silver Apples ever did.    It's difficult to try and describe the emotions this album evokes. It's dark, but it's not depressing. It's strangely comforting, but in a cold way.    I really want to point out some highlights, but I don't know what I'd exclude. Every single song on Third grows on me more and more upon further listens. I suppose I'll say that \\"Nylon Smile,\\" \\"The Rip,\\" \\"Plastic,\\" \\"We Carry On,\\" \\"Machine Gun,\\" and \\"Threads\\" are the songs that particularly stand out to me.    Many times an album like this comes out that wears its influences on its sleeve, and its easy to downplay it because it will \\"never be like the original.\\" But honestly, this blows much of its influences out of the water.
0375826726|2.0|I understand that Christopher Paolini is a young author.  It takes awhile to truly find your voice as a writer.  Therefore, I had no qualms brushing off some of the striking similarities the first two books had to other well known works such as Star Wars.  I mean come on... Eragon/Luke has his uncle killed so he leaves with Brom/Obi-Wan to learn the ways of the Dragon Rider/Jedi?  The comparisons go on.  But the books were fun to read, no argument there.  Refreshing even, in some ways, simply because they were not dragged down by all the drama and plot twists most authors feel they need to inject in their fiction these days.<br /><br />It was that refreshingly simple style that struck me as the first thing the third book was lacking.  From chapter one we are bombarded with Eragon's doubts about where he draws the line in morality.  Should he kill in cold blood?  Should he consult everyone and their brother about every action he makes?  Should we care?!?  In all honesty, these are things that Eragon should have explored after his FIRST battle in book one.  Why is this all suddenly surfacing now??<br /><br />In the first book Eragon became a dragon rider and began to discover his new skills.  In the second book he receives elf training and is imbued with super human skills.  With several major battles under his belt and even more minor skirmishes, a reader should rightfully expect book three Eragon to be a lean, mean, fighting machine.  But the only thing that really seems to have improved with him is his ability to drag a conversation out to unbelievable lengths.  Paolini frequenly inserts conversations that last for pages but cover very little ground.  As soon as I saw the word \\"oath\\" on a page, I found myself starting to skim.  Eragon, for some reason, has this compulsory need to state oaths every 50 pages or so and word them in a way that would put most legal documents to shame.<br /><br />Despite my complaining, I did find that I enjoyed the book for the most part.  Though my enjoyment could have been brought about partially by desperation for a sense of resolution with the series.  I think I was just left feeling kind of disappointed.  I have been waiting for over a year for this book to come out and it feels like all the waiting was in vain.  We have here a nice, juicy 700 page book that could have easily resolved the 3 or 4 loose ends the second book left for us.  But absolutely NOTHING was covered.  None of the characters evolved or changed.  No relationships were explored that hadn't done so already.  And we still haven't even really met the bad guy!!  How do we know if he's REALLY that bad?!?could have been brought about partially by desperation for a sense of resolution with the series.  I think I was just left feeling kind of disappointed.

B0017MO10U|4.0|An excellent continuation of the series, the story line and plot  feel very much like an episode of the series, with slightly expanded scope.  A few CGI scenes seemed to stand out more, but that might just be the clarity of the DVD and did not impact my enjoyment in the least.<br /><br />In short if you enjoyed to series, you should enjoy this DVD.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica has made the best rock album of 2008, hands down.  As far as pure metal is concerned, I cannot really say because I am mainly a progressive rock fan (think Dream Theater, Genesis, Yes, etc.)      Critically, the songs off Death Magnetic are very dynamic, very explosive, and brimming with numerous hooks.  Cyanide, My Apocalypse, and The End Of The Line are excellent.  In Broken, Beat, and Scarred I have never heard a more motivation and basically kick *&s song!      At this point, honestly, I have only listened to this album all the way through once, but I have to give it five stars.  When I play it in the car, I just want to turn up the volume and say f*&k the stupid critics and anyone giving it less than four stars!  I want to see Metallica live - playing solely this album - very soon!  It rocks!  Go buy it - now!
B00005A46U|5.0|Although its follow-up '...Grey and Pink' is more frequently hailed as the best Caravan album, I personally prefer this, their second effort. Though I'm not too well-versed in their mid-1970s period (my preference seems to have wandered off towards Hatfield & The North with Richard Sinclair and his bass guitar) I still say this with some confidence. '...Grey and Pink' is more streamlined and features a more mature approach to constructing the pop hooks that never fail to reel people in, but '...Do It All Over Again' has a far better structure and flow to it, faring much better as a listening experience and unhindered by the logistical difficulties of trying to tastefully dump a vast, side-long epic into its duration.    The melodies and chord progressions are light years away from the jazzy complexities the Canterbury scene had to offer by 1974 and beyond, but many are sweet and beautiful in their own right and instantly memorable. They are easily traceable to the simple, naive charms of the psychedelic pop scene that Caravan themselves began as part of. Jimmy Hastings again makes his presence felt on the classic 'For Richard' suite, providing the excellent brass & woodwind touches that livened up several excellent albums of the era. Elsewhere, the pairing of Pye Hastings and Richard Sinclair was never more equal and more sensitive to each other's vocal and compositional strengths than herein, making this arguably the most balanced album ever to feature these two distinctive musicians.    It's a very breezy listen, full of excellent musicianship and still rooted in the late 60s British psych-pop scene, making it a decent companion piece to an album like Soft Machine's 'Volume Two'. The genre, along with the bands themselves, grew upwards and outwards at an alarming rate after 1970, and while there's certainly a great deal of value in the complexities and jazzy intimidation of later-period bands like National Health, this album has a charming and well-balanced naturethat you'd be hard pushed to find an equal to.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I purchased the 4 season set of Atlantis at Amazon, at an amazing price.      The DVD set  1.  Disc 4 did not work on my Home Theater but it played OK in my DVR.  2.  The menu is hard to understand and there are no scene selection.      The Series:  1  The series is GREAT.  2. It was a bit slow at the beginning, but it picks up by season´s end.  3. The special effects are OK, and at times AWESOME.  4. The characters are fun, and a welcome change from the typical SNG, DS9 and Voyager types.  I am a fan of those shows as well.  5. The main villain and secondary threat are very unique.  The main at times we need more background, but I can see how they are flesh out more on season two.  The introduction of the supporting villain is  something to think about for the Atlantis crew.  Not everything is fun in the Pegasus Galaxy and not everyone welcomes humans.  6. Actually I do not understand the language issue.  Everyone in Pegasus speaks English or did they explained this on SG-1.  I know that in the Star trek Universe the communicator works as a translator both ways.  But here is never explained, so it does not sit well with this reviewer.      I strongly recommend the series.  The four star rating becuase of the problem with the set.
B001EO748M|4.0|After this season's finale, I went back and became engrossed in season 1 again. The differences between the 2 seasons are minute, but I have to say that the production team really stepped up the historical accuracies of the show (after numerous issues with season 1). The attention to detail is shown with marvelous care with the beheadings of Bishop John Fisher and Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam will be sorely missed!), utilizing their heartbreaking and brave final speeches almost verbatim. The acting for season 2 shows a finely glossed maturity for each of the principal characters, but yet you feel a raw pain at what will ultimately be the end of the love affair between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.     JRM's take on Henry VIII is downright frightening this season. Where the viewer saw a somewhat unaware king in season 1, this Henry is all-powerful, all-knowing, and most importantly, UNchecked by anyone. The moody king, the happy king, the fierce pride, it's all there. This characterization of Bluff King Hal is a brave one-there is not a time when the viewer isn't saying, \\"This king is one crazy SOB,\\" but he is still absolutely RIVETING. The beautiful final scenes of the swan being killed and Henry enjoying swan pie, is full of symbolism (remember, swans mate for life). I had goosebumps watching it the entire time.    Natalie Dormer (in my humble opinion) is THE standard for which all other Anne Boleyn's will be measured from this day forward. Forget Genevieve Bujold's portrayal in \\"Anne of the Thousand Days;\\" Dormer's take shows the fragility, self-awareness, and intelligence of England's most controversial Queen consort. Her self-assurance and cockiness in episodes 1-4, her paranoia and manic behavior in episodes 5-9, and finally, the penultimate, episode 10, her quiet determination to die a dignified death, is breathtaking to watch. A positively magnificent performance!     I'm almost too emotional to consider what happens in season 3. How can anyone top Dormer and Rhys Meyers's chemistry (I'm not expecting much from \\"plain\\" Jane Seymour-although Anita Briem has been replaced-or Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves)? The series lost a great spark in Natalie Dormer, but, alas, the show must go on.     4.5 stars (although, once again, the DVD release is sorely lacking in extras)!
B00003CWPL|5.0|This is not so much a story, as it is a celluloid experience.  As an artist who is well versed in surrealism, I find it fascinating to watch.  I first saw it on Much Music or MTV years ago, when it became a mainstay of Halloween Week films they ran.  I am entranced by the images and camera angles, film contrasts, lighting, etc., not sitting there with a wet hanky following the sad story line.  Would a sweet and sentimental story, filmed this way have been as effective?  Of course not.  It requires total wierdness from all aspects.  Would Salvador Dali's work have been as effective with pancakes and whipped cream, banana splits and teddy bears floating about?  Of course not.  It is a masterpiece of horrific bizarreness, shot in such a way as to emphasize the negative.  Another artist's movie--maybe not for mainstream.
B000056JYB|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest of virtually unknown albums. It features the technical superiority of Cream without the abstract lyrics, having a much more spiritual feel to the songs. Steve Winwood is a superb singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist and we all have heard of Ginger Baker and that other bloke on guitar....I forget his name! Rick Grech rounds out the band by playing bass that is much more a backing instrument than a lead as Jack Bruce used to be. Most criticism is levelled at Ginger Baker's only song on the album \\"Do What You Like\\", citing it as a vehicle for a boring drum solo. Last time I listened, there were guitar, organ, bass, and drum solos on this track, none of which were boring. One of the greatest tracks here is \\"Sea Of Joy\\"- hardly mentioned by reviewers and well worth a listen. Am I alone in wishing the central part should have gone on for much longer?<br />Disc 2 is interesting to hear once, but that's about it as far as I'm concerned. Much like the jams on \\"The Layla Sessions\\" box set, very little variation is apparent and they go on WAY too long. I can't understand why more criticism isn't levelled at the jams and less at \\"Do What You Like\\" - at least the latter is relatively concise!<br />The nude girl (NOT Ginger Baker's daughter incidentally) album cover is, let's face it, downright dodgy. It should have been replaced with the Atco 33-304B cover (the sepia band cover) and never, ever seen again.<br />The sound is very good, but not quite in the same class as the long OOP Mobile Fidelity gold CD. That one has the best sound by far - if you come across that album, pick it up!
0452289963|5.0|Read the book and you tell me what you think.  The proof is in the reading but more so the acts of doing what is called for to reach the presence that is within you.  Yes, like Einstein has been quoted as saying  \\"Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.\\"  I am referring of course to  Richard Abane's book opposing Tolle's as new age.  Funny though Hindu and Buddhist thought have been around a long time.  Teachers of all faiths with great merit have come forward to expound the wisdom and life of the texts they study.  Perhaps those who dislike the idea of people reading this book should let us who enjoyed and believe this book go on our merry way to Hell. The \\"God\\" I serve does not punish the seeker for his desire for \\"God's\\" companionship regardless of the avenue taken. But reading this book is not the answer.  Acting on the book is the answer.  Like the teacher's finger who points toward the moon.  The teacher is not the point, nor is it his finger, the moon is the point.  This mind has been starving for insight and in reading this book I know Tolle is right.  I feel it inside, I don't have to think.  The Presence in me, the Holy Spirit knows the truth when it is presented. To disregard the truths that are in this book is like denying the Holy Spirit. The ego wants to win the race first by itself.   The Presence wants everyone to win. \\"God\\" wants all to be saved-not just Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc. but everyone.  If you have ever read All Truth is God's Truth by Arthur Holmes you will not fret about reading and accepting this book as the truth too.

B001C3KCSY|2.0|The members of the Followill family (specifically, three brothers and a cousin) that make up southern-rock outfit Kings of Leon have always tended to stay close to their musical roots, pumping out some very well-received country-fried rock `n roll during the past eight years. Only By The Night is still very like the Kings of Leon, particularly when it comes to singer Caleb Followill, who still over-emotes like the god of Rock he thinks he is and still comes up with high-school lyrics about things like jailbait (\\"17\\") and the self-explanatory \\"Sex on Fire.\\" But the band has taken a detour from their traditional sound, trading \\"southern\\" for \\"arena\\" and cranking up the reverb and effects to remodel themselves into a true stadium band.<br /><br />Now while some songs benefit from the epic treatment, such as \\"Manhattan,\\" with its dizzying guitar lines and rollicking drums, and the buzz-sawing bass of \\"Crawl,\\" for much of the album it feels like Caleb and family are pretending at something they're not. Not that they don't want to be massive southern rock stars a'la Almost Famous; Caleb definitely has the swagger and the ego to pull it off, although his lyrics are unintentionally humorous in their shallowness (just check out this gem from \\"I Want You:\\" \\"it's heavy I know, the black guy with the gift down below / a choke and a gag, she spit up and came back for more\\"). Subtlety is not Kings of Leon's selling point.<br /><br />Guitars chime where they should, solo where it seems right for a little jam, and cymbals crash in all the right places. But it's precisely these kind of calculated hits that take away the originality and charm of their earlier albums and reduces them to rock `n roll caricatures. But hey, as I'm sure all of the Followill's heroes might tell them, sometimes you have to lose yourself to find yourself, and while Only By The Night might obscure their old talent at times, it's a minor mark against a band that has generally proved they know how to rock.
1596434252|5.0|Ok. I'm a bit of a pop-up junkie, a modern design fanatic, and I'm also a mom to a five year old.<br /><br />This book satisfied all of those areas of interest.<br /><br />The cover of ABC3D is a lenticular image (a \\"winky blinky\\") which puts a few letters of the alphabet in motion.<br /><br />The book is black, white, and red. A design decision that really brings the letters to the center stage.<br /><br />If you are giving this as a gift I definitely suggest removing all of the bits of loose paper that protect the letters and also giving the pages a stretch to get everything moving and ready to go, that way the recipient can sit back and enjoy without having any of the little surprises revealed before their time.<br /><br />The pops ups themselves are relatively seamless- the mechanisms are nice and integrated and hidden, which is wonderful.  While I am fascinated by paper engineering and pop-ups, I do have a child who is also fascinated by how things work and frequently misses the message because he is focusing on the medium.<br /><br />This is an alphabet book, but it is also interactive and clever and requires a little bit of thought and problem solving to reveal some of the letters...When going through it with my son he would notice a letter was missing and we'd turn back to find it- some are a little hidden in the motion of turning that pages, and some are revealed through use of integrated velum overlays and even a mirror.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this volume and I am going to buy another copy to keep on hand for gift giving.  I think this would be a great gift for new parents or for a kid just starting kindergarten or as a gift for a teacher or any student... Aesthetically simple, modern, and elegant.<br /><br />An absolute joy.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is surely one of the best films ever made.    This film is a brilliant gem of cinema, with charm, warmth, and     hilariously funny.    The actors give a sterling performance and endear themselves to    the viewer.    While Billy Elliot is not the epic story of \\"Chariots of Fire\\",    I think it ranks just as high in entertainment.    Billy Elliot is one of the best films ever made.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I'm usually disappointed in live recordings, but this is the exception. It's incredible. \\"Within Temptation\\" is a tremendous band, but this recording is beyond words ... if you like this kind of rock, buy this, get this, download it ... I don't care how, but you have to have it. it's absolutely mind-blowing.
0930289528|3.0|It's been mentioned before, but the quality of the printing for this book is pretty poor.  Honestly, I wouldn't have even minded the poor paper quality if the book side had simply been increased by about 2 inches on either side, but as is, things are pretty cramped and a lot of the detail is lost.  So if you're picky, be warned.    If you've seen the movie, then you know what to expect here.  There are some small changes, but for the most part, the book and the movie are pretty much parallel.  I'm sure you've heard that Moore whined about the movie, and I was expecting to see a lot more differences, but no.  The tone is really the same, the plot is the same, Moore was being silly.    I'd say this is take or leave if you've seen the movie.  But if you liked the movie and want to get a slightly different take on the V story, or you haven't seen the film at all, check this one out.
0142412023|5.0|Received order in a timely fashion. Was in perfect, new condition as advertised. Would definitely revisit seller.
0930289234|3.0|I'll preface this by saying that I don't hate Watchmen, and in fact I *liked* it, but I don't *love* it.<br /><br />The plot is competent, but it's also rather predictable.  Moore is obviously trying hard to break cliche's, but he does so by just doing the opposite thing, so it comes off as just a cliche in the other direction and, as I mentioned, utterly predictable.<br /><br />The other problem is that most of the characters are underdeveloped, underutilized, or both.  Other characters are overdeveloped, but serve little purpose.  The end result is that the vast majority of the book is consumed by flashbacks and oddities that are only tangentially related to the main plot of the book (which could likely fit in to about 20 pages taken alone).<br /><br />As far as characters go, the two obvious extremes are Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan.  Rorschach is developed minimally, but brilliantly written and vivid.  His actions and thoughts are clear and consistent, even though he's enigmatic as a character.  Dr Manhattan meanwhile is developed hugely, but changes personality almost from page to page.  He also comes off flat, and as a character with such potential isn't really all that important to the book in the end.<br /><br />Is this worth a read?  I'd say yes, especially if you're in to comics.  If you buy in to the hype and aren't too picky, you'll probably even love it.  But if you spend too much time reading in to it, you'll find this book is a pretty basic story that's so wrapped up in obfuscated, unnecessary backstory that it merely seems more mature and involved than it really is.
B000002UZ1|5.0|For The Beatle beginner this is the second disc to purchase (The first being 1962 - 1966, see my review please).  This disc is the hits from 1967 to 1970 but also you will hear how The Beatles were maturing as a group and also changing with the times and yet could still belt out the best music ever created and music that would still find it's way to the top of the charts AGAIN.  There will never be another Beatles.  In these discs you will hear why.  There is not a bad song on either collection.  Originally released in 1973 three years after they had called it quits the four did come together to put theses two packages together (1962-1966 & 1967-1970).  Even though The Beatles were gone forever the four could still get together in a room and put two perfect packages together and both again go to the top of the charts. /No Neck
B000WS4QJG|4.0|This album should really get two ratings, one for the actual MJ album, and the other for the remixes.    Nothing needs to be said about Thriller.  It's Thriller, and it's fantastic.  Enough said.    The remixes however... are some of the worst garbage released on a major record label... ever.  Fergie attempting to sing Beat It is absolutely painful.  The Kanye version of Billie Jean is nothing but the original song slowed down with a sloppy beat overdubbed.  I'm not even going to speak of the Akon track.  Seriously, these \\"bonus\\" tracks are criminally bad.  I can only assume that their presense on the album is a mistake, and they should be listened to only for comedic value.
B000002UB3|5.0|First off how anyone could give this album lower then four stars is beyond me.  You are either just a Beatle Basher or just have no clue when it comes to music in any way.  This sadly was the end for the lads.  All four already going seperate ways and friendships with each other long gone.  Somehow they got together and did it PERFECT.  As much as I like the The Beatles (White Album) it is also very broke.  The white album without a doubt is just four different guys doing their own thing with help from others, sometimes even members of the group.  This was truly the end and even though that being said somehow this album brings back all The Beatles together.  In typical Beatles style each album different from any other, this album also holds true.  All four playing together like a GREAT BAND AGAIN.  Great love songs in their style like Something but also the pain of You Never Give Me Your Money, Paul talking about the now rotting Apple.  But pain or pleasure this album is pure BEATLES that had matured for that time in 1969.  You will not hear the Fab songs from those great early days like I Want To Hold Your Hand and She Loves You but again the matured Beatles with songs like Something.  A song that even Frank Sinatra stated was the best song that Lennon & McCartney had ever written.  (For those who may not know Something was written by George Harrison).  But either way a very mature Beatles sang Come Toegther even as they were falling apart.  You would not believe that after playing this album which you will over and over again. /no neck
B000002BSG|4.0|It's been said before, but if what you're looking for is Virtual Insanity, buy the single.  With the exception of, to an extend, Cosmic Girl and Alright, it's really the only track on the album that has that feel or sound.    There's a lot of ground covered on the album, and some of it is more successful than others.  Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl are instantly likable, cheery numbers.  Use the Force is a bit on the silly side for me, but things pick up for the next few tracks.  Drifting Along pretty much runs right off the rail for me, and Didjerama is just plain boring (though Digjital Vibrations is alright).    Things start to pick up again after that.  Travelling Without Moving and You Are My Love move back in to the up-beat territory.    The final two tracks are much more chill, but are also possibly my two favorite on the album.    I'd easily recommend this, but be warned that you'll probably find yourself hitting skip on a few of the tracks in the middle.
B000002UYZ|5.0|For those just starting out as Beatles fans.....Welcome.  Not sure how to start ? Look no further.  Instead of buying different albums or discs trying to figure them out start here.  This is the start and pretty much the best of their early work and hits.  It will bring alive The Beatles and yea your going to get hooked. You'll play these songs over and over again.  They say you can't ware out a CD.  You can and you will with this. The only down fall is that you WILL DEMAND MORE.  Dont let the heavy price get you.  You will find that this is more then worth it's price and a better start then \\"1\\" or Past Masters.  Without a doubt this is the best way for a new fan to start.  I was very happy to open this disc and see it on Apple too. Enjoy and please also see my review on the 1967 - 1970 disc too./No Neck
B00006JQU1|5.0|Whatever melancholy soulfulness you've heard in previous performances of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, you won't hear in the recording by Rachel Podger. This Bach is the music of a youthful athlete, sounding as optimistic as Ms. Podger looks on the cover of the CD. There's no question that Rachel Podger has vigorous mastery of her fiddle, and that this performance is uniformly enjoyable. It would only dog-in-the-manger to wish that her \\"affective\\" range were a little wider, somewhere closer to cellist Anner Bylsma, for instance, than to Yo-yo Ma. But then perhaps I'd have to worry about over-interpretation.<br />I've been tacitly rebuked recently for not calling listeners' attention to Rachel Podger. One could do worse than to trust her \\"complete\\" technique to be worth hearing on any of her recordings of Bach or Mozart.
B001DU8T6I|4.0|I'm not really into the whole Disney Channel scene, but my sister picked this up for me the other day and I really liked it. Demi Lovato has talent and even though the songs sometimes sounded similar, it was catchy, and her voice totally blew me away. This CD is much better than some of the professional reviewers are giving her credit for so before you completely blow this CD off as 'just-another-Disney Channel star' give her a chance. She's actually pretty awesome.
0061191981|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to read so I haven't read more than 3 books in the last 5 years. I got this book from the library and read the whole thing in 1 day! Which for me, is unbelievable. I just couldn't put it down. What a story. It is definitely worth a read if you like Ramsay. I love him even more now that I know where he has come from and what has made him the way he is. He has had a very interesting and very hard life. He is an inspiration. I thought I worked hard, I seem lazy compared to his drive and ambition.    I highly recommend this book. I would definitely read it again. In fact, I am on Amazon right now looking for more books about him.

0930289234|5.0|Being new to the graphic novel genre, I focused more heavily on the words than the images.  The story is compelling, dark and very well written.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD stars Russell Crowe as Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey, master and commander of the 'HMS Surprise,' on war patrol during the first worldwide war of the Napoleonic era (1805). Crowe is perfectly cast as Aubrey, an intelligent, erudite captain who can both inspire and lead his men with fairness and firmness, only occasionally resorting to the knout.<br /><br />MASTER AND COMMANDER is gorgeously done, the ships are authentically recreated, and the atmosphere of the film never thins. For anyone familiar with the history of seafaring conditions in those days, the film is somewhat sparse in showing us the true underside of life before the mast on board a late eighteenth century/early 19th century British man-o'-war: A stinking, dirty, dark, dank, impossibly cramped and crowded space most often painted red to hide the bloodstains from work wounds, war wounds, and fights. Compared to the reality, the 'Surprise' might as well be the 'Mauretania,' but beyond this lapse, the film is an honest portrayal. Sailors, be they professional, military, or recreational, will love it.<br /><br />Some reviewers have derided this film as being \\"boring.\\" It is not. However, a drawback of making accurate films about the Age of Sail is that a jack tar's life in those years was defined by backbreaking, repetitive daily labor altogether adding up to long stretches of ennui, punctuated by short, incredibly violent and bloody exchanges with the enemy. To be an honest portrayal, a film cannot find its way around this central fact.<br /><br />Captain Aubrey and his crew and ship, including his friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a surgeon and naturalist, are attacked by the French battle ship 'Acheron.' After being trounced, Captain Aubrey becomes as obsessed as Melville's Ahab with hunting down the adversary, and takes his vessel around Cape Horn, into the Southern Ocean, the Pacific, and to the Galapagos Islands to meet battle.<br /><br />While at the Galapagos, Maturin discovers dozens of new species of life and formulates a theory regarding the origin of these species, but the demands of the service call the 'Surprise' away before he can collect specimens or coalesce his ideas, leaving it to Darwin to do so not many years later.<br /><br />As the film closes, the 'Surprise' continues on her war patrol, leaving the door open for a sequel.<br /><br />RECOMMENDEDof new species of life and formulates a theory regarding the origin of these species, but the demands of the service call the 'Surprise' away before he can collect specimens or coalesce his ideas, leaving it to Darwin to do so not many years later.

B001CD6FKI|3.0|Well this is an enjoyable family movie but not particularly anything to cheer about. To some degree it seems to follow the orginal cartoons, and it reminded me of how the Flintstones were converted to a live movie. In fact we have Fred himself playing Speeds' father. Reasonably good effects and decent acting make it worth a look. I kind of liked it but felt something was missing. Everyone should get a kick out of the other drivers and some of the stunts used to take each other out. I suggest this as a rental first until you know if it is something you truly want to buy. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Spy Kids\\" and \\"Cars\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|I have grown so weary of people dissecting this album for flaws, repetitive beats, retro-ness, and the like. And I am especially sick and tired of people confusing this amazing artist's life with her art. Is Van Gogh's work any less important, or is it in any sense less amazing, because he had such bad emotional problems that he cut off his ear and shot himself in the chest twice--killing himself at 36? NO, NO, NO!<br /><br />I don't care how the artist, producers, button pushers, chalkboard scrapers, or anyone else involved in the making of the recording achieved the sound when it is this amazing. In my estimation, what really matters at the end of the day, is the way an album sounds, and this one is off the charts!<br /><br />The songs on this album run the gamut from suicidal to exhilarated, playful to provocative, old school to new school, fawning to tempting, without ever skipping a beat. And then there is that voice--like Etta James, Billie Holliday, Bettye LaVette, and all The Supremes rolled into one beautiful ear candy confection---chased with a shot of tequila. And did I mention that she has the swagger and in-your-face attitude of another uniquely original artist--Madonna. I realize they are worlds apart musically, but the presence and panache that they both exhibit are what makes me draw the parallel. For better or worse, Amy has the f-you attitude that Madonna had when she was starting out. Say what you will about this woman, but there is no one else like her, and this album proves it in spades!
159562015X|5.0|This is a great book. It was required for an MBA class I am taking and has caught on like wild fire here at work. The author does a great job organizing the content with the best part being the web based assessment. This is a must have if you are a manager.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Thought this was Anima until I watched it and found it to be live action acting, I liked it. Thought it to be a great reproduction of tha cartoon version brought to life. You have to toss out the realistic NASCAR going in circles racing and take it to the extreme. The acting was good and the special effects were excelent. The Blu-Ray DVD also has extra making of content that I liked and found very interesting. I found by talking to others that children also enjoyed it alot and were fond of the chimp.  - As a fan of the cartoon version of Speed Racer, I would recommend seeing this on Blu-Ray. It was funny, colorful and full of action with a great storyline. But, if you want to hear the old original Speed Racer song make sure you watch all the credits at the end.
B000FC10MU|4.0|this book was good i guess . it was enticing to begin with. also it contained a new type of plot but i do agree it is dark and that there is not a clear protagonist but the muddling of charachters gives it some flavor  p.s. it is long

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I am a Coldplay fan and have all of their previous CDs. I was somewhat disappointed with X&Y and was anxious to hear Viva. Of course, we all became familiar with the hits Violet Hill (free download prior to release) and Viva La Vida (via the iTunes commercials). I was immediately taken with Viva and find all of the songs addictive in their own special way. My personal favorite has become Death and All His Friends, the CD finale. I feel transported to the Verizon Center where I saw them live this summer whenever I hear the opening quiet sounds of Living in Technicolor. The album is a mature piece consisting of 11 well-crafted songs. The tone is different - in the main - from the previous three. AND, to this fan, this is a GOOD thing! I think Coldplay has the writing and musicianship to position themselves as a major play in music circles. Perhaps OT, but I must say, that they can certainly work on their live performances! Their show was short (80 minutes with \\"encore\\" for $125 with \\"ticketvulture\\" charges; boring opening acts), and with a few exceptions, the songs sounded nearly identical to their studio version. Not much spontaneity there. Compare this to Neil Young, over 60 and plays two sets nearing 2.5 hours... I am not sure I will pay to see them live again, but I will continue to enjoy and purchase their studio work.
6301971272|5.0|Four decades after it's release the FULL version of Sergio Leone's epic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is finally being seen in North America.  Because the film was cut before it's U.S. release none of the footage was ever dubbed into English.  MGM/UA was able to secure the services of Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and someone to dub the late Lee Van Cleef so this saga is seen as it was meant to be seen.  Missing scenes include Tucco's meeting the three bandits, Blondie and Angel Eyes when the latter's gang appear, and several others.  Many of these scenes make up for gaps in the edited version.  A once terrific film is now truly great!Extra features include documentaries on Leone, the film and have interviews with Eastwood, Wallach and others.
031606792X|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn. The suspense kept me on my toes the whole time. The character development was excellent and I felt a deep connection to Bella during her attempt to sae her family. The detail were perfect allowing me to imagine everything going on. I come to love Jacob even more and Edward becomes manageable. These are the good things    I'm stilling having issues with Bella's obsession wit Edward. They're relationship would be considered unhealthy in today's time. Everything is if he feels like it and he has to have the last word. I mean he doesn't just come off as arrogant; he is arrogant. Bella develops more of a backbone in this book but the obsession is still upsetting. I guess I don't mind that Jacob imprinted on Nessie although it annoyed that Bella got so upset when she should understand the situation better than anyone. I hate how Edward treats Jacob like he's inferior when in reality Jacob would've been way better or Bella in the first place. They could actually have intercourse and have a normal healthy pregnancy but NO PERFECT EDWARD is all she thinks about. Don't get me wrong, I love Edward he just gets annoying and superficial and cocky somethimes.    Great book...way better than the middle 2 and almost as good as Twilight.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Cut short by the writers strike, still season 3 rumbles along on all cylinders like it's trade mark '67 Chev Impala.  New characters -- Ruby, Bela and Lilith -- are introduced to good affect.  There are some nice touches : \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\", a sense of urgency as Dean's year is racing toward a rendevouz with Hell and an episode that has the charm of \\"Groundhog Day\\".  The wit is still there.  A town is inflected by demons and the boys have been locked in jail by their FBI nemesis.  Under the possession of a demon he shoots the town sheriff dead.

0143038419|2.0|I had first heard about this book and the author while watching an Oprah show.  There were women on there who were so inspired by the book that they actually went on similar journeys to India and Indonesia.  So, I thought to myself \\"Wow, this must be a very inspirational book with a profound message\\".  The next day I ordered it in order to experience the journey for myself.<br /><br />After reading maybe three or four pages I knew that the writing style of this author was not my taste.  Her writing is chatty, for lack of a better word, conversational to a point of sheer boredom with metaphors that were simply bizzare.  The writing was all over the place.  You would be reading something about her time in Italy and in a moment you'd be ready about something that happened to her in New York.  It was the same throughout the book.  It did not have a natural ebb and flow to it.<br /><br />Spending months in Italy as she states, I would think and hoped that there would be more creative expressions on Italy as a destination.  It seems as if all she experienced there was eating pasta, pizza, desserts and having conversations with anyone and everyone which to be fair if that is your idea of pleasure then great, but I found it not very believable.  She even mentions she did not visit any museums while there which I find a little strange. Ms. Gilbert also mentions that she changed the names of absolutely everyone in the book.  I had to laugh when I read about Luca Spaghetti in Italy.  I really wondered about it when she stated in the book that it was his real name.  It just didn't add up as did much of the book.<br /><br />India was a little more tolerable in that through this uninspired verbiage the author employed you learned something about ashrams, yoga and meditation.  What I learned about India through this period in her life was almost like reading from a reference book.  No feelings emanating from the author at all in my opinion.<br /><br />Indonesia I will have to say I enjoyed much more.  Her writing at this point was a very factual and detailed account of the Balinese people, their customs and traditions however it was again like reading a guidebook.  I have to admit though that the \\"four brothers\\" is something that struck me and will stay with me.<br /><br />The job of a writer is to capture the reader so that your own feelings and experience flow through the reader.  I never felt anything while reading this book.  I was hoping to find something profound or insiprational.  All I received from this book was a better understanding of meditation and the Balinese people.<br /><br />The book is based on the premise of self discovery yet I never felt this throughout the book.  Her descriptions and insights to different characters throughout the book were sometimes shallow and bordering on just plain rude.  I don't think her intent was to be rude or shallow but rather witty.  The problem is it just didn't work.  Her wit is more sarcasm than anything else.<br /><br />Another point I'd like to make is that after her bathroom floor meltdown when everything was slipping away and she had hit bottom so to speak she was given the money by her publisher to write this book.  That being said I feel as if the lack of feeling and inspiration throughout this book comes from the fact that she was on a writing assignment to explore self discovery rather than experiencing this journey as a result of a devastating time in her life.<br /><br />All in all, I was extremely disappointed with this book.

Once I start on a project, I don't stop and I don't slow down unless I absolutely have to.<br /><br />6. Strunk and White is to a Writer what the Bible is to a Preacher.<br /><br />7. Life isn't a support system for art, it's the other way around.<br /><br />8. The idea that the creative endeavor and mind altering substances are entwined is one of the great myths of our time.<br /><br />9. You must not come lightly to the blank page.<br /><br />10. The first draft of a book should take no more than three months, the length of a season.<br /><br />11. The adverb is not your friend.<br /><br />12. The combination of a healthy body and a stable relationship with a self-reliant woman who takes zero bull from me or anyone else has made the continuity of my working life possible.<br /><br />13. I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words. That's 180,000 words over a three month span, a goodish length for a book.<br /><br />14. Only under dire circumstances do I allow myself to shut down before getting 2,000 words.<br /><br />15. When you write, you want to get rid of the world. It's wise to eliminate every possible distraction.<br /><br />16. Paragraphs are almost as important for how the look as for what they say; they are maps of intent.<br /><br />17. The paragraph, not the sentence, is the basic unit of writing.<br /><br />18. Grammar is not just a pain in the rump; it's the pole you grab to get your thoughts up on their feet and walking.<br /><br />19. Write about anything you want as long as you tell the truth.<br /><br />20. You need a room, you need the door, and you need the determination to shut the door. You'll also need a concrete goal as well.<br /><br />21. You should anything that improves the quality of your writing and doesn't get in the way of your story.<br /><br />22. Writing fiction is a lonely job<br /><br />23. The first draft should be written with no help from anyone.<br /><br />24. Never let an unfriendly draft cross the threshold of your office or out of your desk drawer.<br /><br />25. The most common tool of any writer is vocabulary.<br /><br />26. Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox and don't make any conscious effort to improve it.<br /><br />27. Do not dress up vocabulary, looking for long words because you're a little ashamed of your short ones.<br /><br />28. Invest in a copy of Warriner's English Grammar and composition.<br /><br />29. Don't be a Muggle. Avoid the passive tense!<br /><br />30. I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs<br /><br />31. Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation.<br /><br />32. The object of writing isn't grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story.<br /><br />33. I can't lie and say that there are no bad writers. Sorry, but there are lots of bad writers.<br /><br />34. While it is possible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer, it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one.<br /><br />35. The secret of my success is that I stayed physically healthy (well, almost) and I stayed married.<br /><br />36. You're job is to make sure the muse knows where you're going to be everyday from Nine `til Noon.<br /><br />37. Novels consist of three parts: narration, description and dialogue.<br /><br />38. Plot is a good writer's last resort and the dullard's first choice.<br /><br />39. The situation comes first. The characters come next. Once I have these things fixed in my mind I begin to narrate.<br /><br />40. Description is what makes the reader a sensory participant in the story.<br /><br />41. With characters, it boils down to two things: paying attention to how real the people around you behave and then telling the truth about what you see.<br /><br />42. Symbolism exists to adorn and enrich, not to create a sense of artificial profundity.<br /><br />43. Symbolism is a focusing device for both you and your reader, helping to create a more unified and pleasing work.<br /><br />44. Revising is three drafts, or two drafts and a polish.<br /><br />45. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.<br /><br />46. You should put your first draft away for six weeks before starting the second draft, because it's always easier to kill someone else's darlings than your own.<br /><br />47. When you give out six or eight copies of a book, you'll get back six or eight highly subjective opinions about what's good and what's bad in it.<br /><br />48. Pace is the speed at which your narrative unfolds.<br /><br />49. Your early readers will also gauge whether or not your story is paced correctly and if you've handled the back story correctly.<br /><br />50. The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) every one has back story and (b) most of it isn't very interesting.<br /><br />51. Routine interruption and distraction don't much hurt a work in progress and may actually help it some ways.

0810995212|4.0|This is a wonderful collection of J.C.Leyendecker's artwork and a must own for illustrators and lovers of Leyendecker's art. It's quite worth the asking price. My only complaint about the artwork shown, is that so much of the Saturday Evening Post covers are just too small to appreciate like they should be, however, that's understandable as if they were four per page, then that would be one huge book.     But the real reason I have a disappointement with the book is in the writing. That's why I didn't give it the full five stars the artwork alone deserves. If the authors could have only left their personal beliefs about Leyendecker's life out of the writing and focused on the historical facts. (To the author's, while I'm sure you believe that the \\"facts\\" you presented are facts to you, because you believe them, that simply doesn't make them facts to everyone else, whether you think it should be or not.) It's a shame when authors writing biographies place their own interpretations of another person's life down as fact. And that's what more or less detracts from the whole experience of the  book.     Other than that, kudos to well put together archive of Leyendecker artwork.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book. I'd recommend it for women of all ages, especially if they are searching for balance in life...well really, who isn't?
1591841216|3.0|I bought this book because it was required reading for a class.  It's pretty common sense stuff.  It's alright, but if you can borrow it from a friend, go that route.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I first saw this movie on AMC about seven years ago, and I fell in love with it!!! It's funny, it contains a few of the greatest actress of the golden age of Hollywood, and it's well directed.    Yes, it's a little sexist but, remember the time period of the movie. But, even with that it's the best movie ever. I just hope the the new remake of this movie, will live up to the original.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|This sounds a LOT different than previous versions, but it was remixed. The CD label says that pretty clearly. I doubt any re-recording was done, or anything was added, but I guess I could be wrong. My impression is that the remixing and remastering has just made everything sound cleaner and more crisp -- a LOT more crisp. I think it sounds great. Nice package, too, with lots of great photos.
0316067601|5.0|This book is told in Marcus Luttrell's first person voice, and has three parts to the story:  1) SEAL training and its methods to select people only of awesome determination and skill, 2) a firefight gone wrong in the mountains of Afghanistan, and 3) Marcus' hiding and eventual rescue with help from the Afghan people. Marcus' view and attitude about the Liberal Media is also covered through out. He make a strong moral case:  don't start war and commit people's lives unless you are prepared to use all means available to win...anything less is immoral if I can use that and war in same statement<br /><br />This is an incredible story of human determination. Besides covering the training of a SEAL, this book also helps us understand a foe we don't really understand
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Out of all of the Metallica albums I own this is definitely not the best. I was very excited to hear new album was being released but the disappointment of actually listening to it was bad.<br /><br />Also the CD packaging just is not necessary. You don't need the gimmicks sell CDs to us older folks. We're not young kids anymore and I don't think you're going to get any kid's to listen to this album. Gimmicks don't sell music good music does.<br /><br />If you really do have a curiosity to hear this although. I would suggest that you wait until you get a used copy for couple dollars.
B001DRF84W|2.0|I absolutely love this movie, BUT, unfortunately, I think I've received a bad batch of Blu-ray discs from Amazon. After three minutes of waiting for the movie to load, the first one would cause the Sony Blu-ray player to automatically reboot once the movie starts, no matter if it started from the beginning or at a random chapter. It wouldn't happen when I would play the Extras, only the movie. I asked for and received within 48 hours a replacement Blu-ray disc and encountered the same exact problem. And I know it's not the player, because I played other Blu-ray discs with no problems. Hopefully, I'll get to see it on Blu-ray soon because from what I saw on the opening menu, the movie looked great.
B000TEUCFA|2.0|OK.  Well, I guess the vast majority of the reviewers are Stacey Kent's best friends.  Or it could be they are like the fans of be-bop, who aren't nearly enough of musicians themselves to be able to understand it, yet alone play it, but know \\"intelligent\\" people are supposed to like it, so they do.  But one way or another, the folks here who are saying that this album is a triumph are selling you the Brooklyn Bridge.  Virtually every original song is at the same tempo (dirge-like).  The lyrics may be \\"clever\\", but so is grand opera (and I don't recommend that either). And the bottom line on this cd is that it is by far her weakest effort if you're a fan of the standards era.  Not because the songs aren't \\"standards,\\" but because the songs are weak.      Here's the easiest example to make this clear (and none of the sycophants can dispute it).  I've seen Ms. Kent in concert half a dozen times.  Each time, she drew standing ovations not just when finishing for the evening, but literally during the sets. However, at the concert I attended on her tour promoting \\"Breakfast...\\", half the audience left at intermission and all night long the crowd kept calling for songs off of other cd's.  So by all means try Stacey Kent.  She's absolutely wonderful.  But don't spend your money on this one until and unless you completely flip for her after hearing \\"Let Yourself Go\\" or one of her other earlier works.    OK, brown nosers.  I'm ready for your attacks now.  I'm sure you're all fans of tone poems too.
0783227434|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing. This is actually one of the first DVD's I ever bought among a list of endless titles. It is unforgettable, crazy and downright madd. Love it. Get It.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Absolutely beautiful.  Rex Harrison steals the show. \\"Why can't a woman be more like a man?\\"  Indeed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have a lot of workout videos and this one is one of the best. Even if you are in shape, you'll be hurtin' by the end of the 30 minutes--totaling 500 calories. I love 30 Day Shred because you can build upon your workout. She has a \\"beginner\\" variation that you can start with and once you can do the \\"advance\\" workout, it's time to move to the next level. I quickly got in better shape and it carried over to my other sports. It got to the point where others noticed and asked me \\"what I was doing.\\" After a couple of weeks, I would do two levels back-to-back, so I was burning about 1000 calories in the hour workout.  Jillian is very motivating and gets you thru the workout. Note: there are A LOT of lunges, so if you have knee problems, it may not be the best for you. I would also recommend her website that has the eating plan and support.<br /><br />Update: Still like the workout, but after doing it all summer long, I noticed that my knees hurt (no matter how careful I was of my lunge form). Now I limit the amount that I do this DVD.
031606792X|5.0|This book was a great finish to the series.  It was the quality of the first book in the series.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has read any of the other Twilight books.  There are some real surprises in store for you and unexpected twists.  You will definately want to buy the end of the tale and find out what happens to all the main characters.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|My tastes in music go all over the place, but rock will always be my absolute favorite. I'm a big listener of Metallica, ever since the late 90's and I enjoy both the old and new rock styles they put out (except St.Anger, I'm not sure what happened there). This album is by far one of my favorites this year.     Metallica has put the pedal to the medal on this album, and I was blown away. I agree with many reviewers that this does sound like the missing album between And Justice for All and the Black Album. All of these tracks are very long, but are meant to last. \\"Suicide and Redemption\\" is 10 minutes long and purely instrumental but brings back the memories of Master of Puppets and Orion. I really got into \\"All Nightmare Long\\" \\"My Apocalypse\\" and \\"The Judas Kiss\\" during the first listen, all metal and well done. \\"Cyanide\\" wasn't that good but after a few more listens, now I like it. \\"Unforgiven III\\" (Another?) I actually like over the previous two mostly due to the piano opening and that it doesn't sound like the previous ones. The word is never mentioned in the song (though \\"forgive\\" is). \\"The Day The Never Comes\\" reminds of the days of Load/Reload. If you like those albums, you'll like that song. If you don't, well, still give it a listen. \\"That Was Just Your Life,\\" fantastic opener. \\"The End of the Line\\" and \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" also rock hard and play rough.     Okay, so you found some issues with the production. I don't see what the big deal is, the album still rocks. All is forgiven from the last album, welcome back guys!    Favorites: All of the Above.    Buy it. No more to say.
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire twilight series.  There were many delimmas met throughout the saga up until right before Breaking Dawn.  I liked the way that everything did eventually work out.  I think that's what most readers hope for.  And for those haters who rate this book as a 1 because of the lack of message or because they say that it sends the wrong message, well I definately don't agree.  The message that got was that just because things in life seem impossible, it doesn't always mean that they are.  Never give up hope.  I recommend this book to everyone.
1400079179|1.0|I was given this book as a gift- read it- and immediately put it on EBAY. Funny thing is that someone bought it. This may be the biggest piece of formulaic BS I have ever read. The writting is very weak, and although I am not an historian, I doubt any of it is true. Maybe it's me but, I cannot believe all the hype this book has recieved. It frightens me that so many people speak so highly of this trash. Maybe that's also why Sarah Palin is so popular. HYPE, HYPE, and more HYPE, with an intriguing cover. USA! USA! USA!<br />Save your time and money and skip this book. Or better yet, if you want to see great writting read the Best American Travel Writing. They also have collections for sports, science, and short stories.
159102594X|2.0|There is a species of writer who use their skill the beguile the reader, much like a trout poacher reaches slowly into the water with his hand, \\"tickles\\" his prey, then abuses the hapless creature's trust. Joe Abercrombie is such a writer.     Abercrombie creates a world of compelling characters to seduce the curious reader into his narrative. The prospective reader should know that all those characters are made to suffer at the author's hands until, by the time we have reached the end of the third volume, we feel as though our time and sympathies have been quite thoroughly and deliberately wasted. There should be a government-mandated warning about this sort of thing on the book jacket.     If you like the kind of horror story in which the characters evolve from a condition in which optimism is at least thinkable, to attain bleak, abject failure, then this trilogy is for you. In truth, Abercrombie's characters don't really evolve, or even change, over the 1800 or so pages of this opus. Instead, the author carefully rations the information he gives us  so that we are misled. We are misled into thinking that this character might have grown wiser, or that another has at last gained some maturity, only to have that impression destroyed by another fact that the author chooses to reveal. This does not happen only once or twice--autorial manipulativeness is the defining characteristic of this work. In the end, all the characters are still what they were at the beginning, before Abercrombie started tossing us crumbs of information about them. Logen the Barbarian is a crazed killer, Mage Bayaz is the Anti-Gandalf, Jezal a mooncalf, and Inquisitor Glokta a saintly torturer, who is at least a little bit funny.     To be sure, Abercrombie is skilled (as any fish-tickler must be). One can hope that he gets over his Gothic obsession and...well, lightens up.
B001152TL6|1.0|The movie starts out with a man (Bill Pullman) that suspects his wife (Patricia Arqhardtospell) of cheating on him. He finds video after video proving that it is happening. After a bit into the movie, she ends up dead and the man ends up in jail.    In jail he has a strange dream the night before he disappears and is replaced by another man entirely! It is assumed that he transforms, it is not shown. The 19 year old that replaces him (Getty) is released and the original man is never mentioned again. There are hints though that Bill Pullman's character really exists.    There is a tie in between the two characters that is not seen until near the end. It is almost as if the man that wrote the 'Lost Highway' book wrote 2 books and smashed them together. 2 different men, with 2 different lives that exchange lives for a week or so in time.    The 19 year old is a mechanic working for a mobster Mr. Eddie (Loggia) who is really Dick Durant. Mr. Eddie's wife (Patricia Arqhardtospell) has an affair with the 19 year old and looks very similar to Bill Pullman's wife. Not just because they are played by the same actress, but because they are supposed to be ties between Bill Pullman and Getty.    The style of this movie seems to be a series of artistic shots that would be better off as photography. Shot after shot has 5 seconds of a person standing doing nothing. Then they do something, and stay there for 5 more seconds from a different angle. This movie is very easy to fall asleep to until the 45 minutes into the film when the character Peter Doyle comes into play.    It is an intentionally strange movie that is dark, sometimes crazy and heart pounding and other times eerie. Everyone should watch this movie just once for those reasons. The soundtrack is stellar and it is the best ad for this movie there can ever be.
1596434252|5.0|I collect many pop-up books, especially those of Robert Sabuda, Matthew Reinhart and David A. Carter to name a few.  I was excited to see a new alphabet book in a pop-up version and couldn't wait for it to arrive in my mailbox.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  Keep in mind that this is a deceptively simple ABC book with well-engineered pop-ups.  Mine arrived with a slightly defective B spread, but I was able to fix it with some gentle nudging.  It's rare to find a copy of any pop-up without a slight problem.  These are all hand pieced books, each unique, and even the best engineering cannot overcome the occasional awkward fold.<br /><br />But back to the book.  The color scheme is kept simple to red, white and black.  Each letter arises from the page or is adapted on the page through bits of paper management.  While the page turning can lead to a slight pause or confusion over a letter, the book quickly teaches you if you play with it.<br /><br />My favorite element is the playfulness.  As someone who has been using the alphabet for several decades, I still gained some insight as to how the letters relate in form to each other.  So did my graphic designer husband.<br /><br />This is an effective ABC book for toddlers although it must be used as a lapsit book to protect its fragility, true for any pop-up.  Older kids will enjoy finding the letters, manipulating the pages to make them appear and trying to figure out the mechanics of the pop-ups themselves.  From vellum to mirrors to other clever relations, this is an artistic learning tool.  It's one of my favorite ABC books since the award winning The Graphic Alphabet by David Pelletier as well as A Is For Salad by Mike Lester.
0670033049|5.0|Hard to imagine a greater defining work of the 20th century ... the story is so complex and multilayered, and yet so simple and clear in its narrative. The reader finds a lot to ponder in its pages, and many times I had to put the book down for a moment and merely think about its truth. Like the following:<br /><br />\\"And I feel that I am a man. And I feel that a man is a very important thing -- maybe more important than a star. This is not theology. I have no bent toward the gods. I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe.\\"<br /><br />The story of Adam Trask, his sons and his good friends -- Samuel Hamilton, the handy-man philosopher; and Lee, the house servant and wise man -- is a parable of how we all struggle between the forces of good and evil, placed in a rough and beautiful American milieu, the Salinas Valley, Steinbeck's Garden of Eden. Adam is caught between hope, conveyed by a strong desire to prosper and transcend, and the deep wound of a dark secret, conveyed by his failed marriage to Kathy, a serpentine soul who dwells in darkness and evil. In this crucible his sons, Caleb and Aron, act out the tragic drama of earthly competition, fratricide and redemption that is the inheritance of the children of Abel and Cain.<br /><br />In this Eden we encounter ourselves in our reckless, restless existence. Over a conversation with Lee, Caleb hears about the wild adventurous nature of Americans, violent and generous, fearful and bold, who \\"go from barbarism to decadence without an intervening culture.\\"<br /><br />And in another, between Lee, Samuel and Adam, the reader faces the core challenge of living: While we are not commanded to be good, neither are we predestined for it. \\"Timshel,\\" Lee quotes from the Fourth Chapter of Genesis, the story of Eden itself. \\"Thou Mayest.\\"<br /><br />Poised between right and wrong, good and evil, life and death, this masterpiece asks, which do we choose?
B0000640VO|1.0|In my humble opinion this would have been a precious movie except for a few things, like...the frontal nudity and shots of people making out. Then there is the idea that people can live happily ever after if they fall into bed after barely knowing one another.  Stuff like that.  Doesn't work for me. If you can believe it, you will enjoy this movie.  As for me I'm reeeeeally glad I watched a cheap used copy before I gave a DVD as a gift to a teenage relative - since I had gotten the impression elsewhere that this was a safe bet.
B000065BPB|5.0|Ok, I don't really know much about headphones.  But, I do know when I am pleased to hear music, and when I am not.  I've been listening to metal music for the past hour and I must say that these headphones seem to capture so much detail in the music.  I have polkaudio stereo speakers and by comparison these headphones sound so much crisper.  That's really saying something because I never expected $100 headphones to outperform a pair of $200 speaker towers.  Yet, they do just that.  The range of sound is incredible.  Strong bass, good mid range, and decent highs.  Not perfect by any stretch, but for the price I am well pleased.    Note: If you are going to buy these headphones I recommend that you buy them directly from amazon.com.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Perfect songs for getting over the demise of a \\"broken\\" long friendship. Lyrics and music are really good. I enjoyed this 2 cd album the most!
B00004RYZT|5.0|I've been a fan of Rammstein since the mid 1990s but only recently got to see how great they are in concert and this DVD does them great justice. I watched it again last night before I even received the email from amazon.com to write a review on it. I would recommend this DVD to any metal fan and definitely to any Rammstein fan. You just can't tear yourself away from it once you start it up. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this DVD. ~Chris from Missouri
0979660742|5.0|William Strunk's book \\"The Elements of Style\\" was recommended to me by an American friend, whose linguistic abilities I value very high. I ordered the book immediately and was surprised, when it arrived, by how thin it was. It turned out to be a compendium, which would best be memorized (I am not joking!). This American English writing style guide was written in 1918, but has not aged at all. The most important rules of American English, and the ones most commonly forgotten (like the use of Saxon Genitive of commas), are gathered here. I found the collection of frequently misspelled words very useful, too (although I though of some I could add, for example \\"receive\\", which I see misspelled more often than not). For me, the most helpful part was the discussion on brevity and omitting then unnecessary words - I still struggle with long sentences and too many adjectives and adverbs. This small volume is a must-have for anyone who wants to write correctly in English!
B000Y179KO|1.0|This horrible mess is filled with flat-out, bad songs that are rife with trite lyrics (\\"I heard some wise man say that every dog will have his day\\" or \\"I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you 'cause there's nothin' more that I would rather do\\"); beautifully sung; and meticulously, if somewhat lifelessly, played.  Listening to these CDs is like listening to an Eagles tribute band, who sound uncannily like The Eagles, but mulishly insist on playing their own lousy originals.  The problem is that the great Eagles songs from the 70's had more hooks than you'd find in a Velcro factory.  These songs have nary a one.  Remember how you had to skip through the filler on \\"The Long Run\\" to get to the good songs?  On these CDs the filler has taken over and the good songs never appear.  At one point--in order to relieve the monotony--The Eagles start singing in falsetto (I kid you not), Bee Gees-style.  Leave this turkey in the bin at Wal Mart, go home, pour yourself a glass of tequila, and reminisce.
B001FEAA3C|5.0|This 1999 redeems the original release, which only had 9 songs and not in the order in which they were actually performed in the monumental live performance filmed by Jonathan Demme.    To hear the whole set list played in the intended order - and believe me, the order matters as anyone who's seen the film knows - is to relive the film, and that's a very, very good thing.    And if you never saw the film, Netflix it.    If you're already a Heads fan, this '99 issue is a great way to introduce a needy friend to one of the bands from the late 70's and 80's that really *mattered.*    Download immediately, w
B00000DGUY|4.0|Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits is a good compilation of a great rock band.  Mark Knopfler is a great guitarist, lyricist and a gruff but alright vocalist. Robert Sandall has written a well-written and informative short synopsis/bio about the band.  The cover is ok but a bit boring. The photographs are all very nice and well done especially the one shot of Knopfler as it captures his intensity as he plays his guitar. I definitely recommend this album. 4 stars indeed!
B000YAA68C|4.0|Three stars for the movie itself, four stars because the cast is so charming. I would add another star if only Gerard Butler had been on screen more.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interesting<br />films as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again. He has<br />crafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named after<br />one of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of Johnny<br />Cash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her<br />portrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Family<br />singers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merely<br />another way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy young<br />starlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia<br />Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, Charlize<br />Theron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of the<br />industry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films they<br />appear in can bear the Oscar imprint.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of his<br />league as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer Phedon<br />Papamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do little<br />to enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poetic<br />element. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static and<br />dull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not grasp<br />is that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of his<br />singing and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focus<br />on the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going to<br />focus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up the<br />fascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all people<br />go through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,<br />when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT like<br />the average person. In other words, as the saying goes, always print<br />the legend over the truth. Walk The Line never trots down that alley.
B001DPC52C|5.0|If you have never had the privelidge of seeing the Silent Force Tour on DVD (originally released in PAL a few years back & now just released in NTSC format) you will finally get the chance to see on of the BEST bands in the genere and wow how they have evolved since then. WT pulls out all the stops for this unbelievablly stunning performance. On stage they look so excited and enjoying this perofrmace so much you can feel it. The sound and picture are crystal clear shot in HD and the whole package is a top notch effort. All the classics are here and they open the show with a Jaw dropping rendition of Jillian- they then power thru their amazing cataloge while the symphony orchestra & choir accompaines them to an amazing effect. They have video screens, pyro, stilt walkers and various other FX to make this on extrodinary evening of music and a MUST have DVD. Period. Do not miss The Black Symphony it one show you will never forget and want to watch over & over again.
B001CVCBLM|5.0|For the uninitiated, Mogwai is one of the most popular (and most talented) \\"post-rock\\" bands in the world. They have been rocking and rolling for almost ten years and their albums stand as monuments to post-rock music. What is post-rock you ask? I don't know exactly...but I know I enjoy most music labeled as \\"post-rock.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hawk is Howling\\" is another fine addition to the Mogwai catalog. Like every Mogwai release, the music captures many different emotions and sentiments.<br /><br />The track sequencing is superb. (Listen to every track from the beginning to the end.) The album features both soft, meandering guitar pieces and loud, furious guitar pieces. The soft tracks and the loud tracks work together to create a unique experience.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"I'm Jim Morrison, I'm Dead,\\" is gentle and melancholic and then it soars upward in volume and intensity.<br /><br />Track two, \\"Batcat,\\" explodes with layered, heavy guitars.<br /><br />The next track, \\"Danphe and the Brain,\\" is breathtaking (for lack of a better word). (Turn up the volume and soak it up.)<br /><br />The next several tracks, \\"Local Authority,\\" \\"The Sun Smells Too Loud,\\" and \\"King's Meadow\\" are all flawless.<br /><br />Track seven, \\"I Love You, I'm Going to Blow Up Your School,\\" is gloomy and ominous, but perhaps the most thought-provoking track on the album.<br /><br />Tracks eight and nine, \\"Scotland's Shame\\" and \\"Thank You Space Expert,\\" are gentle, but more uplifting and positive.<br /><br />And the final track, track ten, \\"The Precipice,\\" builds to a fantastic and conclusive finish.<br /><br />(Several B-Sides, not included on this version, are circulating throughout the internet; they are awesome too! But DO NOT download this album. Show some respect for the artistry and the artists.)<br /><br />If you love post-rock music or music that never receives radio airtime, consider \\"The Hawk is Howling\\" from Mogwai. It's different; it's fresh.<br /><br />Keep on rockin' and rollin'! Bring Mogwai home; order this album today.
B000002L9J|4.0|The Queen Is Dead is a showcase of some of the best of 80's brittpop. Morrissey is an accomplished lyricist and yes a great vocalist. Johnny Marr is responsible for the music and frankly he does a bang up job to say the least. The problem I have with this recording has nothing to with the music. The book-let is a travesty. The cover is uggly and the photos look atrocious. The clothes they wear look drab to say the least. The decision to have the latter half in pink is also a bad decision to say the least. Apparently Morrissey made the sleeve and that is shame. Since he is a great vocalist and lyricist but a subpar artist. Steve Wright must be a friend of theirs since the photos look they have been shot by an amateur.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This POTO is amazing, underrated by those who wanted to see simply the stage version memorialized. Don't be deterred by those who wanted Michael Crawford to reprise his stage role -- bye the bye, he was in his mid-sixties by the time the film was made. I saw this POTO more than once with people who had seen the stage version and were as impressed as I was with the cast and production. Do watch the widescreen edition if possible as you then will see the lavish sets and superb camera work in all their glory. Please note, this version is a dark, turbulent, sad, romantic rock opera, not a horror film; as such, it is perfectly cast and presented.
B000069HZP|5.0|Great movie! Most of the reviews indicate that most people see this as a movie about a man who plays a life-changing game given as a gift from a brother who also benefited from playing the game. I think it's really about a rich guy who never understood why his father committed suicide at the age of 48 and on his own 48th birthday he finds himself rich, but alone, miserable, depressed, and wondering how much he might be like his father, heading in the same direction (maybe toward suicide). His brother, knowing his rigid, responsible, analytical, and no-fun nature, and that he's miserable in spite of his wealth, tries to help him by giving him an unusual but life-changing gift, \\"The Game\\".<br /><br />The story is great fun to follow, but the climactic ending is about how the man is finally driven to the brink of sanity playing this game, and falls (jumps) from a building to end the torment. When he actually ends up safe and at the expected outcome of the game, he realizes it was all to teach him 2 things in such a dramatic way as to change his life: Finally, an understanding of why his father could be driven to suicide (since he was himself driven to it).  And, that his wealth and life situation are tenuous, that he can now relax, not be so rigid and serious and begin to enjoy life again, before it's too late.<br /><br />His brother understood that, by giving him the game as a gift, how it would help him so profoundly, because his brother had a life-changing experience playing the game.  We never find out how much the game cost the brother, but you figure it's gotta be, perhaps, millions. Don't try to pick the movie apart as being too unrealistic. Of course something like this is not meant to be real life.  A movie doesn't have to be real to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Sometimes, one's ability to let their imagination suspend reality briefly, also let's them thoroughly enjoy a movie like this. This is just a great story with a lesson. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be?<br /><br />I thought the movie was intriguing, amazing, and thought provoking; one of my top 10 of all time.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show.  It got me through high school and I am 26 now.  I STILL AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE DARIA!!!!!
B000P0J09W|4.0|In 1985, Steven Spielberg ([[ASIN:B00003CXC5 the Indiana Jones films]] and [[ASIN:B00003CX9Q E.T.]]) served as an executive producer on the Goonies, an adventure film based on a story by Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner ([[ASIN:B000059Z8J Superman]]). Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.    The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?    Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqué humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.  The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.    The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.

B000002UAX|5.0|There are those that love to bash the Beatles simply because they're so popular and rock icons. It's just those being defiant and against the grain. The Beatles White Album succeeds because of the surprising production values and the sheer magniture of the individual talents who are on display here. It would be senseless to analyze each cut when the entire album is superb. I was in a rock band in the mid-1960's and The Beatles were always the standard to be measured by. They sang better, recorded better and wrote the best songs. There are those that will find Revolution #9 tedious and pretentious, but it does give us a glimpse of Yoko Ono's influence on John Lennon. What makes this album unique is the eclectic vareity of music on the double CD. I never tire of hearing this CD and after 40 years since its release, it's the Beatles CD I keep going back to. Every cut is a surprise.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I was quite shocked at how the editorial review for this cd was so negative. Yes its true that this is different from Niki Sixx's previous work but in my opinoin it is vastly better. Throughout the cd, the listener can feel the raw emotion that Sixx was feeling at that time. It is simply a phenominal cd.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I used to have a negative review on it, but now it grew on me to a solid Metallica thrash metal album.  This can be put along with their classics.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Only by the Night is a lot different from the rest of the Kings of Leon albums, but after a quite a few listens, I really like the album now.  The songs are slower than the first two albums, but like a few people have mentioned, the added reverb and production make the songs sound \\"bigger\\".  If you listen to this album expecting Aha Shake Heartbreak, you will be turned off, but do like I did, listen to a few  times and you probably will really start to like the songs and notice that they're catchy and full of energy.  Trust me, I hate when bands sell out, but expecting most bands to change over time, I don't take it personally when their style does change.  So for my two cents, this is a very good album.  Its not the same KOL, but you can always listen to their old albums; Only By Night is its own sound and a well constructed one at that.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic is truly a rebirth for Metallica, and mixes the best elements of their classic thrash albums (RTL, MOP, ...AJFA) with their tighter black album. The songs are aggressive and exciting overall--in fact, I'd say that this is the most energetic and exciting metal album of the last decade (not that the last ten years have been all that good to metal)--the guitar solos don't get old with repetition, and every element fits squarely into the song. Even interludes seem to be part of a tighter formula, and feel less wasted than they did at moments on ...AJFA and RTL (MOP was pretty damn close to perfect). My only gripe, and it is minor, is that whereas RTL, MOP and ...AJFA saved the last track for especially melodic (The Call of Ktulu) or headbanging aggressive (Damage, Inc. and Dyer's Eve) masterpieces, the closing track on Death Magnetic is My Apocalypse, which, though it's not bad, does not do the album justice as a closer.    In the end, though, that gripe is minor, and it's exciting to have the \\"old\\" Metallica back!
B000002UAU|5.0|People who are too young don't realize what a turning point in pop music history this album was. Released in June 1967, it changed the way musicians and people as a whole looked at albums. Before this release, with the exception of Revolver and Rubber Soul, most albums consisted of two or three hit songs and lots of filler. The Beatles raised the level of quality on albums to an art form. But the change was more pervasive. For better of for worse, it opened the gates for a new culture of drug-induced music. Let's face it, this album was a real experience under LSD, mescaline and even pot. The realm of time and space in a song form was creatively changed and also the concept of album art, production values and overall attitude. It was a landmark album, and although to many younger listeners it may seem dated, pretentious or weird, it was a historical cultural event that changed the course of pop music forever. It was said that it was influenced by Brian Wilson's Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys, another turning point in pop music. But Sgt. Pepper blew the lid off and made the \\"single\\", a thing of the past. Essential! An icon in music!

B000N3ST7K|4.0|Listening to this soundtrack is blast from the past.  Quentin Tarantino out did himself with the slections he chose for this movie and cd.  How many cd are out there with the Smiths (baby it you)  This CD Rocks!
B00070DK14|4.0|Being a big Jethro Tull fan, this is one of their best albums, mainly because of the instrumental presentation.  It's modern rock meets the Dark Ages with this album's mythical notes and creative lyrics. Great piece of work!
B00005JPO1|2.0|Mild spoilers -    I can deal with magic/aliens, but there still needs to be rules to a movie world. Once those rules are broken it removes the viewer from the experience. Indy 4 did this a lot. He survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator, plus the refrigerator flies through the air a couple miles lands and Indy just pops up. Mutt hops up in the trees and swing like some CG Tarzan with monkeys, then the monkeys attack the Russians. Why did they monkeys attack the Russians? Oh yeah, I forgot about the monkey vs Russian war of 1975. Then all the characters go down, not one but three waterfalls, that make Niagara falls look like a children's slip and slide. There is NO sense of danger. In the first 3 movies you knew Indy would pull though, but Indy still seemed to be worried about his situation. Here, everyone just showed up to get paid.
B0000793Z9|4.0|I'm a little bit disappointed with this remastered version, it sounds almost tinny and lacking in bass. A perfect example is the opening track \\"Someone, somewhere in Summertime\\".  Just because a CD is labelled \\"Digitally remastered\\" doesnt mean you are necessarily getting a better product over the original CD.  Often the remastered CD is just a volume higher so that when you put it on it might sound better because it is really loud.  I'm just not convinced.  Perhaps record companies are just trying to get our money twice.  Think about it.
B000002UA5|5.0|This album, along with Meddle, are the two best Pink Floyd albums ever, as far as I'm concerned (discounting the Syd Barrett albums, which were in a different category and great in their own right). I don't need to describe the two discs in this set as it's been done over and over again.<br /><br />What I'll say is I think this is when the band was the most creative, and Roger Waters had the least amount of influence on the outcome. I love it for the true experimentation, the originality, and the sheer psychedelic mood of it all. As I listened to it again after 30 years, it still rings true with me and despite what the band itself has said about it (and not all of it complimentary), I think this showed the band as a truly creative force.<br /><br />They never did anything after this that comes close, except for Meddle.<br /><br />If you want to hear what the Floyd sounded like before they went commercial, I highly recommend this album.
0375826726|2.0|Nothing really moves in this book, least of all the story - there are endless fights - we got that Roran was a fearsome warrior in the last book, why hit the readers over the head with it again & again? And yes, compassion for the enemy very positive but really an Urgual bedtime story? And just HOW is it relevant to the plot?     Brisingr is a story mired in self-indulgence by the writer, the details detract not enhance, like a badly cut garment hides behind overmuch embroidery.      Actually the writing isn't bad, but the editing of this book was really disappointing - considering that only 3 things of significance happen in this book, were the 700 pages required? All those details, a 'supportive' book, would have been better than stringing out the trilogy.. like badly watered wine. (after effects of the book, all these metaphors, agh!)    Ah! Christopher-finarel, as Eragon's poem so the story, it only works if you believe in it!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over and it is always a great staple in our home.
B000GYHVFC|4.0|The visuals in this movie are definitely eye candy, with the scenery and futuristic buildings and conceptual designs enticing. Charlize Theron as a model, has a mold to break,and she's done it previously with roles such as Monster, Devil's Advocate and others, so I enjoyed her in this role. However, the story is a bit slow moving, and not conceptually unlike other movies already created (Minority Report, 1984, Demolition Man). The PQ and AQ are 4/5 on this HD DVD, and it's worth a buy if you like the slower paced, atmospheric, and dreamscape type feel of some of the futuristic shows/movies releases on the big screen.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie, I'll leave that for everyone else.  All I can say is that I am SO happy that Warner Brothers changed the digital format that comes free with their DVDs.  I had bought last Harry Potter DVD for the digital version, only to discover it was not compatible with i-pods.  This version is!  If you are going to spend the money and want the option of it for your i-pod, get the Special Edition.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|Okay, don't hate me for this, but I came to a revelation while watching `Emma' the other night.  Are you ready for this?  Please, don't chastise me for this because I'm sure if you think about it you'll agree.  Okay, here it goes...<br /><br />I don't really understand why Jane Austen is so popular when each and every one of her stories seems to be the same story with different names.<br /><br />Okay, I've said it, and I'm sure the hate mail will come pouring in now, but it had to be said.  I know that some of you have seen this too, I mean, you'd really have to be blinded by your love of the period goddess to have not see it.  Yes, her stories are touching and for any lover of the genre, films like `Sense and Sensibility' and `Pride and Prejudice' are really top notch entertainment (I love both those films by the way, so don't take this little revelation as an `I hate Jane Austen' tirade, for it is not), but one must realize that there is really little difference between the two stories.<br /><br />Girl loves boy who loves another girl.  A different boy loves the first girl but she is put off by him.  When the boy the girl loves finally loves her she realizes that she loves the boy she was put off by but he is now in love with another girl.  Eventually they realize they are meant for one another and the ending is, of course, very happy.<br /><br />That said, `Emma' is sweet and charming in its own right, but it pales in comparison to the previous Austen juggernauts (I love Paltrow, but she is no Winslet and she can't manage to muster up the charm Knightley brought to her performance).  The plot, while familiar, is not really the issue here.  I think the biggest issue is Paltrow.  Now I will not say that it was her accent, because it wasn't.  I actually thought she pulled that off quite nicely.  The problem was that she wasn't very entertaining.  I found her rather boorish and uninteresting.  I expected her to be emotionally investing (as was the always stellar Winslet) or perky and excitable (as was Knightley).  Instead she was just barely there and really was overshadowed by nearly everyone else on the screen.<br /><br />It was exciting to see Toni Collette is a softer role.  She is truly a wonderful actress and played her part beautifully.<br /><br />In the end I just can't see a real reason to entertain this film unless you are a devoted Jane Austen fan.  If you are merely a fan of the genre then select some of her other work (or some other work period) since this is not the cream of the crop.  Its familiarity is only the underlying foundation for my displeasure.  It is the lack of spontaneity and the lack of overall excitement that makes `Emma' a dull girl.was Knightley).

B001BKG9SK|5.0|I was surprised to receive this in the mail today!  Haven't watched the DVDs yet.  I'm currently half-way through the second CD.  There's a beautiful and touching version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond (maybe the first time the song was performed after Syd's death).  Very excited to hear a live version of Echoes, my favorite song...    But I think they messed up the booklet that came with the 2CD/2DVD set.  I open it up and see the listings for disc 1.  Then I turn the page and see disc one again, upside down.  Turn the page again and disc 3 is listed.  Then I turn the page and again see disc 3, again upside down.      Not that it's a real big deal, but I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have never seen this movie in such beautiful color. We own a 12 foot screen and the quality was superb. Taken from direct masters, restored for superior color and sound. The extras are superb, too. Errol Flynn movie trailers and the alternate ending that was never used, which pre-dates Disney horse-drawn carriage scenes shown often in Cinderella and others. Don't buy the single disc, but the two-disc set. You owe it to yourself.

The length of the stories of the stories has a lot to do with it.  Most are 50-60 pages.  The last 3 stories are especially compelling.  They follow 2 characters at various times in their lives:   when they are children, in adolescence and later in their 30's.      Highly recomended.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this soundtrack, especially Meryl Streep, and especially during \\"The Winner Takes It All\\". I think this version is far superior to the one on the OCR. However, I was disappointed in a couple of omissions. \\"I Do, I Do...\\" wasn't there, and it was one of my favorite moments in the show. For some reason, the number wasn't even in the movie... a very poor choice by the director, since its a great moment. Also, the encore numbers of \\"Dancing Queen\\" and \\"Waterloo\\" were not there. Very strange, since there is plenty of room on the CD for it. My guess is that they will come out with some sort of special edition of the CD that will include it. All in all, a fun recording that could have been better.
B000002IOY|3.0|Years of Decay is a good metal album, but I prefer the earlier Over Kill material like on Feel The Fire. Years of Decay marks the end of an era for the band, as they lost yet another essential member following this record (Rat Skates left right before this album). For me this is really their last album worth owning. It has a cool early-Maiden sound in my opinion, like around the Number of the Beast era, but with a lot more speed and energy.

B000FIMG68|4.0|Before I say anything else, there are two things you need to know about this set:  1) A subpar LOST episode still better than 90% of the shows on television today.  2) Because of the show's nature, anyone interested in seeing future seasons (which are *really* good) has to watch this set.  LOST isn't the type of show you can skip a few episodes and hope to understand what's going on.    Now that I've gotten all that out of the way...    This season was a big disappointment.    After an incredible, Emmy-winning and immensely popular first season, it became clear that LOST was going to be one of ABC's top shows for quite some time.  The problem with that is that LOST, more than most shows, needs a definitive ending.  There needs to be a point where we find out definitively what happens to all the characters, and get answers to all (or at least most) of our questions.  But with pressure to keep such a ratings giant on-air as long as possible, the writers needed to keep a tight control on the flow of answers, leading to a season that feels dragged out.    For every answer you're given on LOST, at least one more question arises.  For instance, the season opener answers one of last year's big mysteries: what's in the Hatch?  But as soon as you find out, you are left with a ton of new question about who the heck built it and why.  This sort of thing used to be entertaining, but as the season progresses the balance between answers and new mysteries gets thrown way out of whack.  We are given many, many more questions than answers, and after a while it starts to get frustrating.    This season also introduces of a group of survivors from the plane's tail section to decidedly mixed results.  Some, like the Nigerian priest/mystic Mr. Eko (excellently portrayed by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), are fascinating and bring a new layer of intrigue to the show.  Others are not so enjoyable, particularly the obnoxious ex-cop, Ana Lucia.  Her backstory is awful, her tough-girl attitude seems cliched, and the actress who plays her, Michelle Rodrigez, CANNOT ACT.  Her line readings are all identical and unconvincing, and the attempts at making her sympathetic fall flat.  She looks even worse in comparison to the rest of the cast, which continues to be stellar.    Luckily, she is somewhat offset by the season's best new character, the deliciously manipulative Henry Gale.  Brilliantly underplayed by Michael Emmerson, Gale's scenes are the most riveting part of the season.  You won't what he does, and yet you can't help but marvel at just how expertly his mindgames trick the other characters into doing exactly what he wants.    Although it is not as good as the first season, Season 2 of LOST still has a lot to offer.  They don't come as frequently as you'd like, but you will get answers to some plot threads leftover from last season.  And it's still fun to try and glean as much information as possible from every visual hint and cryptic piece of dialogue.  The interactions between the main cast (particularly the Jack-Kate-Sawyer love triangle and the science vs. faith feud embodied in Jack and Locke) continue to be fascinating and expertly acted.  The run of episodes leading up to the season finale is tension filled and has more than a few surprise deaths.  And the production values and on-location filming continue to be breathtaking.    This set also comes with a decent set of extras, although I do question their choice of which episodes to do commentaries on (the ones chosen seem neither particularly good or important to the plot).  Overall, fans will not regret buying this set, even if it doesn't quite live up to the admittedly high standard set by season 1.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Nolan's Prestige, like many of his films, is a dark, somber exploration of human emotions, ambitions and failings. It features many of Nolan's artistic touches, including his trademark out-of-sequence narrative, so those of you who hate this format will be irritated by the progression of this film.<br /><br />The Prestige chronicles the intense rivalry between two ambitious young magicians struggling to make it big in turn of the century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) actually begin as colleauges, both working as magician's assistants on an act engineered by Cutter (Caine). A tragic accident during one of the performances transforms a mutual professional jealousy into a bitter and lifelong feud that will cost each man dearly.<br /><br />Angier and Borden are the embodiment of two diametrically opposed philosophies and it is this collision of ideals that lies at the very heart of the film. Angier is more concerned with showmanship and accolades than with the magic itself, while for Borden the craft is what consumes him, audience be damned. The lengths each will go to in order to achieve their ideal, and simultaneously outshine the other, provides the key to the mystery that ties the whole story together. This film has not one, but two twists to its ending. You might guess the one halfway through, but the second is very cleverly concealed by Noland's deft direction.<br /><br />The film competed against \\"The Illusionist\\", which had been released to critical acclaim a few months earlier. Among the two I prefer the The Prestige, which I find is deeper and handled more maturely. Many people disagree, preferring the lighter, more conspicuously 'magical' Illusionist. This is reflected in the ratings here on Amazon as well (The Illusionist averages half a star better).<br /><br />The Prestige is certainly a darker, somewhat less straight-forward film, and while some might resent the sci-fi spin added in the last act, it provides the basis for the moral abyss into which Angier must fall. Both Angier and Borden are developed to a much greater extent than any character in The Illusionist; they simply feel more human. In fact, it is their very humanity, their frailties, that warp their passion into obsession, and finally into hatred and revenge.<br /><br />Featuring Scarlett Johansson as the love interest and David Bowie in a great turn as Nikola Tesla. Highly recommended.st fall. Both Angier and Borden are developed to a much greater extent than any character in The Illusionist; they simply feel more human.

0375826726|5.0|I suppose that coming into this book expecting it to be 750 more pages of 'Eldest' was not the most optimistic view to take.    Brisingr is far, FAR better than Eldest.  In fact, it is difficult for me to believe that both Eldest and Brisingr were written by the same person.  However, that's what it says on the cover, so I will assume it is true for the remainder of this review.    Now, this is just a short list of the improvements that this book makes over its immediate predecessor:    -Roran is (properly) relegated to a minor character's role.  -Eragon has given up on his adolescent infatuation with Arya, and even tells Roran at one point that he will no longer pursue her.  -The character of Eragon has grown.  Along with abandoning his infatuation with Arya, he questions the need for killing so many men, and shows some feelings of mercy and compassion for (what seems like) the first time.  -There is no more obtrusive faux poetry.  -The Purple Prose has been cut significantly.  No, it's not gone; but it's far less intrusive now.  -Paolini has apparently disposed of his thesaurus.  We are no longer subjected to long, winding passages including weird words like: eyrie, fecund, diaphanous, machicolated, fey, bivouacked, variegated, alacrity, mephitic, turgid and widdershins  -The story actually moves in a forward direction.  It slows down once or twice but never stops or goes into reverse.  -Eragon never talks to any ants.  (Quite possibly the single greatest improvement.)    But Brisingr is not a 5-star book simply because it improves on Eldest.  Even if Brisingr were a stand-alone book, it would still be absolutely stunning.    Please allow me to indulge in another list:    -The comedic scenes are authentically funny, and had me laughing aloud a few times.  -In this book, we are introduced to a few new viewpoint characters.  One of these is Saphira.  Saphira's chapters are nothing less than some of the best writing I have ever read.  -The action scenes are (with minor exceptions) amazingly well written, and give the reader a ring-side view.  Nothing is glanced over or cut too short.  -The climax is one of the best I can recall ever reading.  -As mentioned before, the characters actually start acting like people, not the emotionless cardboard-cutouts that have inhabited the prior books.  -Though the story's flow slows down slightly a few times, it always picks up a few pages later.  Aka, Paolini keeps your attention from front to back cover.  -Upon finishing this book, we know much more about every race that inhabits alegaesia.  This is not pointless meandering, it is world-building in earnest.    Alright, then.  Summary time.    Brisingr is an utterly amazing novel, and the proof that Paolini understands the intricacies of story writing, flow, characters and world building better than some 'professional' authors.  I had some worries after reading Eldest, but those worries have been eradicated.    10/10
0061474355|4.0|In a world where the Dead haunt the Old Kingdom and threaten its unprotected residents, Sabriel must leave the safety of her boarding school to take up her father's mantle as Abhorsen, a magic-schooled necromancer with the ability to journey to the land of death and set the world back to rights. Sabriel is distinctly high fantasy, which may require some adjustment, but the setting is imaginative and original for the genre. In this first novel, Nix's story telling is cumbersome and amateur, but the solid plot, unique setting, and strong female protagonist make up for it. This is an imperfect but engaging, vividly realized book, and I recommend it.<br /><br />Presumably because this was his first novel (I've yet to read any of his others), Nix's narrative voice in Sabriel is mediocre--not outright bad, but cumbersome and amateur. It's chock full of awkward adverbs, uses a relatively small vocabulary (sometimes repeating words or phrases in consecutive sentences), and is altogether unexceptional. It feels like a first draft: all of the pieces are present, but the storytelling which ties them together is simply artless. As a result, the book begins slowly and feels like something of a disappointment before the plot gets going.<br /><br />Thankfully, when the plot does get going, the book comes into itself--and it is a strong, original story. From the safety of school to the Old Kingdom across the Wall, journeying from her father's home to the ruin of a great city, Sabriel is a questing story of epic scope. The quest is feels realistically long and dangerous (but never drags), and the premise, challenges, and climax come together in a strong and intriguing plot. Sabriel and her companions draw the novel's epic quest back to a human level, and Sabriel in particular is a lovely character--strong, gifted, but not without fault, she is an inspiring and interesting character. Rising above all the rest is the setting: I don't often read high fantasy, but Sabriel reimagines the genre, doing away with common elements and reinventing magic as a complex, creative science which has been tainted by the encroaching presence of death. At once magical escapism and dark dystopia, the setting is intriguing and it sets this book apart: it is higher than the average young adult (urban) fantasy novel and more unique than the average high fantasy novel.<br /><br />Because of the writing style, I was initially disappointed by Sabriel; I still have my reservations about the novel, and I wish it were more polished and mature. Nonetheless, I'm glad that I pushed through my initial disappointment, and I found Sabriel engaging and enjoyable. I will probably go on to read more of Garth's novels and this series, because the setting in particular captured my imagination. I recommend it, in particular to fantasy readers, who may love this change of pace, and to young women, who may find inspiration and companionship in the character of Sabriel.ay with common elements and reinventing magic as a complex, creative science which has been tainted by the encroaching presence of death.

B00004U8JV|2.0|*Spoiler Alert - Some plot details are included in this review*<br /><br />The transition from popular novel to Hollywood film often results in a misshapen mess, and that is certainly the case with this disastrous sequel to the fantastic Jurassic Park.<br /><br />The Lost World is simply a stupid film. I won't belabor the misspent opportunities to include good sequences from the book because I know that what works well on paper doesn't always work as well on the big screen. Still, the sheer lameness of the screenplay, the horrendous 'Hollywoodification' of the basic characters and plot, is beyond belief.<br /><br />The first 2/3's of the film deal with the capture of the T.Rex, which requires an entire army of what must be, quite frankly, mentally challenged mercenaries. Most of these are casually swallowed by various 'meat-a-sauruses', grenades and all. The only scene that comes close to the kind of tension from Jurassic Park is one drawn directly from the Lost World Novel.<br /><br />For the grand finale, the filmmakers had the audacity to have the T.Rex run around Los Angeles, eating dogs and attacking buses! 'How did the T.Rex manage to escape in the first place?', you might ask. Why, by eating the captain and crew of the ship it was being transported on, causing said ship to crash at full speed into the dock. The preposterous notion of a T.Rex eating its way through a ships crew while out at sea is only topped by the scene showing that the captain's disembodied hands are still gripping the steering wheel. Not only that, but T.Rex apparently had the good manners to lock itself back in the hold after devouring the crew! How considerate.<br /><br />Ian Malcom (Goldblum) returns to star in the sequel. Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn join the cast and Dr.Hammond (Attenborough) and the kids make a brief appearance. Everyone else is entirely disposable.<br /><br />For fans of this movie, I don't really get it, but preferences differ and I'm glad at least a few people got their money's worth. For those who haven't seen this sequel, purchase with caution. I recommend Jurassic Park III, which comes much closer to the original than this disappointing attempt.t seen this sequel, purchase with caution.

B001DU8T6I|4.0|Demi Lovato is one of the best vocal performers that Disney has in its repetoire. Her talents are many and varied; her voice is completely unique and her sound and style are just as different. She is bright and enthusiastic one moment and the next, she is soulful and warm - there is insane talent within this girl. This album showcases just what she's vocally capable of and her songwriting ability. The songs on 'Don't Forget' are nearly impossible to forget.

B001DDBCV4|4.0|Okay guys, this is the reality. Your significant other is going to buy this movie and you are going to watch it with her.    Now the title seems promising. But this is about sex from the other perspective, hers. This means it is about relationships, and communication, and intimacy and trust. These are subjects women discuss among themselves at length and with us usually to be greeted by earnest but blank expressions. It is not something you necessarily get, but she wants you to, so you try.    Here we have four fortysomething friends whose bond remains tight through one romantic disaster after another. We have their men, who like you, are clueless but ernest. We have an alpha-girl Carrie who is getting married, to Mr. Big, played hugely by Chris Noth. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a mid-list author which in New York makes you a minor celebrity. Her friends, mostly struggle with their own relationships, excedpt for one who is happily married thus proving marriage is not an impossible institution.    Well as fate would have it Carrie gets left at the altar by Mr. Big, and the rest of the movie (except for the not so surprising ending) is all about what a jerk he and men in general are.    So since you are going to watch it, I recommend a few tips. First watch it in Blu-Ray  on an 1080p HDTV. The photography and scenes are gorgeous, especially in Mexico where the girls go on what would have been Carrie's honeymoon. Secondly the DVD comes with a \\"digital copy.\\" This means you can install it on your iPod,      If you want to be extra sensitive install it on hers.
B00006DEF9|5.0|An affectionate look at life at Hollywood life in the 20s. Not superior to An American in Paris as someone labelled it, but splendid in its energy and timelessness even if it is a period picture. Great piece of nostalgia and fantastic dancing sequences. Gene Kelly at his best in designing the choreography and its execution, admirably supported by Donald O'Connor and Cyd Charisse, plus Debbie Reynolds at her cutest.  Great movie!  E.Renard
B001DU8T6I|3.0|A fairly decent album in my opinion. Lovato doesn't have a voice that's out of this world but it's decent, however it's the control she has over her voice that makes her stand out. She knows she has limitations but in the album she cleverly hides them by playing to her other strengths; such as in Don't Forget, the album's best track, the soft start goes smoothly with the thin vocal range she displays and then the sudden change in pace created by her guitar, creates enough distraction to overshadow her poor range. The end result however is still a decent song. She performs similarly throughout the rest of her album so at times the album borders on boring. What hurts her album the most is that she can't seem to deliver the same emotion in the studio as she does on stage that results with a lot of the songs being second hand versions to ones she performs live. Overall i give the album a 2.5/3 out of 5 for her effort and voice control, the lyrics aren't bad but they are too whiny at times. If Lovato would stop trying to be Disney's good girl and come out with her original material that wouldn't be fit for a disney album then she could be facing a long successfull in the music industry.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|this is a great CD. i didnt know it was this good or i wud have bought it a long time ago :-).  All the songs are good, except for maybe one but thats because i dont like slow songs so its really not the song itself i guess.  but anyway, awesome CD!!
0385606575|5.0|Phenomenal read! Very, very easy to get through. Superbly written. Kind of like an evil version of the Harry Potter world... except, well, not.  I loved it. Proof that not all must be roses and fluff to be wonderful and magic! This book was part of a series that I just couldn't put down. Highly recommended when you want something entertaining and consuming with lots of Djinn.
0446402389|5.0|Tom Rob Smith writes Stalinist Russia so well, I kept checking the jacket picture to make sure he wasn't an 80 year old man. Incredible tension keeps you turning pages from start to finish. Compelling central character who actually learns and grows, as do the supporting characters. Somehow, this book qualifies as both \\"high\\" literature and genre fiction--the best combination. This book just may have one teeny tiny flaw, but I wouldn't dare discuss what I think it is for fear of giving away the ending. But if it is a flaw, it's so teeny tiny it's not even worth mentioning. Read this book!

B001C3KCSY|5.0|Ok first off I will admit, I am a huge KOL fan. I have been playing their first 3 albums non stop leading up to this album. In their only by the night home movies, I liked what I heard when they played the snip-its of the songs. After listening to the album I am amazed. This album is so great. I don't understand what people are hearing, the band has not changed one bit with its style. Each album is different from the last, but at the same time having the same KOL style. This album is the exact same another positive step for the band. If you are a KOL fan you will enjoy this album. It is solid from beginning to end, go out and pick this one up, you won't regret it!!
B000001DYD|5.0|I'll never forget hearing the lyric \\"You leave me dry\\" for the very first time. I was a seventeen-year old boy who had a thing for bitter women. Polly lured me in with her unique vocals and I enjoyed every moment of it regardless of how uncomfortable I felt. The erotic, raw cover (which goes hand-in-hand with the erotic, raw material found on the record) stuck in my mind and haunted me. It wasn't a new feeling for me: I was in love--again. I seriously have no idea what I've been doing my whole life before I found out about Polly: the stark lyricism, the marvelous guitar playing, the demanding performance and that deep feminine vocal delivery made her my artist of choice.<br /><br />I consider this to be Polly's first masterpiece (she upped the ante two years later with \\"Joan Crawford on acid\\" extravaganza To Bring You My Love) and certainly one of her most striking albums. Dry was raw in its own way too, but this time around, Polly worked with sound engineering marvel, Steve Albini. The two masterminds worked together in late 1992 and produced this everlasting piece of art. In Utero picked Albini the acclaim (regardless of the fact that Nirvana's stupendous third album was heard by millions in a heavily remixed mode), but Rid Of Me is where it's at: check out the perfectly set dynamics in \\"Me-Jane\\"--every drum kick and every note work together in a milisecond of time. The rest of the record is strong as well: \\"Man-Size\\" plays like a thriller; the quiet-loud dynamics (popularized by grunge in the early 90s) are most obvious in the album opener which also sports Harvey's most famous lyrics (\\"lick my legs/I'm on fire\\") and the album's closest thing to a ballad, \\"Missed\\"--all work together in a coherent whole.<br /><br />A personal favorite and an absolute standout, \\"Rub 'til It Bleeds\\" shows what is so special about Peej: she describes sex as a staple of both lust and violence, playing with aggressive notions of sexuality while leaving you in a state of both shock and pleasure. I've adored a lot of women over the course of several years of my experiences with music, but hardly any can compete with Polly's raw moaning. Check her out in \\"Legs\\" and \\"Snake\\": she's playing longing and pain with such conviction that it's no wonder people have mistaken her for a bitter female she never was. \\"Hook\\" sounds like slow death filled with gore, starting with what could only be described as Polly's most menacing riff ever. The sextet version of \\"Man-Size\\" brings in the Psycho strings for even more unpleasantness. She covers Dylan's \\"Highway 61\\" and it sounds nothing like the original which makes it all the better for it. Polly's most recognizable riff is witnessed in \\"50 Ft Queenie\\". Lyrically most bizarre, \\"Yuri-G\\" plays in that typical Albini fashion--mighty and punctual. A short noise-rock epic \\"Snake\\" manages to rule in just a little over a minute. Polly's most bluesy riff on the record kicks in in \\"Ecstasy\\" which just ends things on a high note.<br /><br />Making a record like Rid Of Me demands a lot of creativity and even more dare. PJ always played by her own rules, and it's what makes her so inimitable. You'll rarely find an artist who thinks it's all a role to slip in and produces something that seems as nothing but. Rid Of Me is the essential record of the early 90s. The reason is simple: only a few more albums can capture the raw, guitar-driven spirit of that decade like Rid Of Me does. Polly didn't stop making music after this chilling masterpiece; she only kept changing her skin. For most of us, her compulsive need for change and not repeating herself only meant more fresh music to explore. Still, this remains her most daring endeavor. Admire it from a safe distance.dored a lot of women over the course of several years of my experiences with music, but hardly any can compete with Polly's raw moaning.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Being as there have already been 400+ reviews of this album, I probably don't have too many original thoughts to share, but I felt compelled to weigh in on the apparent outcry over the low sound quality of this album.<br /><br />Basically, I don't see the problem.  Sure, I'm not one of these audiophiles who has a five grand stereo system in my house and/or car, but as a long time music lover, I just don't see what the fuss is about.  If anyone out there is scared that this album sounds as godawful as \\"St. Anger,\\" put your fears to rest (THAT album's sound was truly a travesty).  This album sounds no different than most everything I've bought recently, even when blasting at a high volume (everyone seems to indicate that this is where the quality diminishes).<br /><br />As far as the album itself, I agree with everyone saying that it sounds like the Justice/Black Album days, and I believe it to be WAAAAY better lyrically, musically, and production-wise than Anger.  If you've heard the first single, \\"The Day That Never Comes,\\" just focus on the last part of the song where they really start to jam, and that's basically what the whole album sounds like.  Thank the heavens, that Band Formerly Known As Metallica that gave us \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" has crawled back under a rock, and the metal gods we used to know have returned once again.  They even threw in one of their trademark instrumentals (Track 9, \\"Suicide & Redemption\\") that hearkens back to the good ol' days of \\"Call of Ktulu\\" and \\"Orion.\\"<br /><br />If you want symphonic metal with absolutely superb sound quality, look to Symphony X or Dream Theater-- this is Metallica, man!  The crunching guitars and gutteral vocals sound just fine to my ears.  I just don't see what the 1-star reviewers are so worked up about, but that's just me.<br /><br />On a side note, I suggest you purchase the jewel case version of the disc.  The booklet poofed out on my cardboard version and it won't close all the way anymore.  Not a big deal, just an aesthetic gripe.<br /><br />In summary: A solid, solid effort this time around, and worthy of the five stars simply because this is the best work Metallica has done since the Black Album 17 long years ago.  (Holy $#!%, has it really been that long???)<br /><br />But that's just my opinion.  Click on the samples above and see for yourself.

0375826726|2.0|I have waited a long time for this book to come out but only to be rather disappointed.  The book starts off well but then turns too wordy!  The author should have stuck with the original plan to finish the series with book 3.  I actually was bored!  While I want to find out how the author decides to finish off the story, I cringe at the thought of having to plough through another 700 - 800 page book.  Am I waiting for the next book? Yes, but not looking forwarding to the monotonous wordiness of it.  Indira S.
015206396X|5.0|I can't imagine a better debut novel. It's by far one of the best books I've read this year. Heck, maybe in the last few years. Bella of the Twilight saga has nothing on Katsa from Graceling.    The plot is fairly simple. A man was kidnapped and the main characters are trying to uncover why.    Gracelings are graced with different abilities: to fight, to bake, to kill, to paint. It's like taking the extraordinary people and giving them different colored eyes to set them apart. People know they are extraordinary simply by the colors of their eyes. For Katsa, she is graced with killing, and is therefore a tool of the court of her unkle, King Randa.    The book starts with the rescue of a man from another country. During the rescue, Katsa meets a man in the dark and lets him live, even though he has seen her and knows who she is. Later, he shows up at the castle trying to locate the kidnapped man, his grandfather. Thus starts a relationship between Katsa and Po, for Katsa is a charter member of the Counsel, a network of people run by a group that goes around trying to right wrongs throughout the seven kingdoms. Member of the group include Prince Raffin, King Randa's son and best friend of Katsa since childhood; Captain Oll of the king's guard; and Lord Giddon, who is in love with Katsa, even though she doesn't return the sentiment.    Po has a grace in fighting, or so Katsa thinks, but finds out something different later that makes her uncomfortable around him. However, they put their differences aside to travel together to other kingdoms to try and find out who kidnapped Po's grandfather. Together, they uncover some evils concerning a dark king, and try to make things better for everyone, in the true nature of the Council.    It's truly a remarkable read. The characters are so well-developed, even in such a fast-paced book. You really enjoy the characters, the banter between them, the action, the emotion, everything. Once you pick up this book, you won't want to put it down.    Some small negatives. I didn't really care for the ending of the book. It wasn't that it was bad or left things open, it just wasn't the ending I would have written. That said, I'm not the author, so bully on me. Still, it was a decent ending and certainly should dissuade anyone from reading a book full of such amazing writing. Also, the character of Bitterblue (and I don't like that name at all, even though the Princess Bride was named Buttercup) just didn't resonate with me. Sometimes I felt the dialogue or actions just weren't appropriate to someone only ten years old.    Read this book. I know it's hard to take a chance on a new author, but it is well worth it. Even if you end up not liking the book, it's a very easy read for such a high potential reward. But I think the majority of people who read Graceling will find their money well spent.    I look forward to further works by Kristin Cashore.

If there is a Mothership Two, I will certainly buy that also.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|It is such a shame that a-ha did seem to drop off the radar here in the US, as I loved their early releases very much! It has been difficult, but I FINALLY have the completion of my a-ha collection and this CD was SO worth my waiting!! They are brilliant and I look forward to more from them in the future!!
B001AJVR5M|5.0|I love this item. I'd been waiting for it for ages and I finally got it!!
B000B0WODA|2.0|This album is appropriately named, because you honestly can do so much better than this album.  Their prior album was very good, but with the exception of a few tracks, this one is bland.  I listened to it maybe 10 times after buying it when it first came out and didn't listen to it again until today, hoping I would have a different opinion of it.  But I haven't changed my mind.  If you liked their first album, I would recommend the Arctic Monkeys, which is a fantastic band.  Both of their albums are superior to anything Franz Ferdinand has done.
0743290119|2.0|Chasing Harry Winston was a total disappointment with lack of originality and storyline. The book tries to be Sex & the City in so many ways by having single New York women, love and friendships. Even though you hope the story will become interesting at some point it becomes clear that the story line is not original and same goes for the characters. The novel had potential and yet did not deliver.    Just a heads up Weisberger if you are going to write about single women in New York, you have to write something more umm let's see ORIGINAL!
B000B0WODA|3.0|Being a big fan of Franz Ferdinand's first piece of work, especially the classic \\"Take Me Out,\\" I checked out their follow-up album to see if they could avoid the sophomore slump and provide us some more rock anthems. This album has a problem though in the lack of variety. Either their sound doesn't permit a great deal of variety, or the vocals don't permit it. Either way, it's a very monotonous record.<br /><br />In fact, the first track is the best track, and it's the best gauge to see if you're going to like the rest of the album, because if you love the song, then you can stand listening to the whole album in one sitting. Otherwise, you're out of luck. Not to say it's a bad album, it just could have used more depth to it. So, hardcore fans unite, everybody else find other means.<br /><br />Real Score: 2.5
014100018X|5.0|Chocolat / 0-141-00018-X<br /><br />\\"Chocolat\\" is easily one of my favorite novels - the escapism is fantastic, the food descriptions are mouth-watering, the plot and prose are beautiful. I can hardly believe that a novel so richly packed with meaning could be so relatively short and such a quick read. Harris' prose here is at its finest, as we follow the narratives of Vianne the free-spirited chocolate-creating witch, and Reynaud the guilt-stricken oppressive village priest.<br /><br />Each narrative is uniquely told, with personality quirks inherent to each, and each narrative can be subtly imperfect. Reynaud's precise narrative slowly descends into madness; while Vianne's vibrant narrative is gently laden with a fear of displacement - she doubts herself, her lover, and tries to balance her own wanderlust with her longing to belong to a community. The narrative is as delicate and bitter-sweet as Vianne's chocolates, with possibilities abounding on either side.<br /><br />This is a novel of acceptance and love. Vianne is a single mother whose goal in life is \\"to be happy\\" without hurting anyone else. Many villagers are held up as examples of warm Christians and non-believers alike who gather around Vianne in kindness and acceptance. As the men and women of the village come together to support their local chocolate shop, their eyes are also opened to other forms of abuse in their community, and they learn to embrace the most vulnerable members of society and make a strong statement against those who would be abusers in their midst. Harris insists that the members of this community all deserve love and kindness and friendship, and differences mean so much less than the similarities - there's no reason that Vianne, a young and vibrant witch, cannot be close friends with Guillaume, an elderly and stately Christian, because their friendship is based on respect and humanity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone - this is a book that spans gender, religion, age, and country. Do note, though, that \\"Chocolat\\" is best enjoyed with a tall glass of milk and dark chocolate truffles near at hand!<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollugh, that \\"Chocolat\\" is best enjoyed with a tall glass of milk and dark chocolate truffles near at hand!    ~ Ana Mardoll
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I enjoyed hearing morrisons' great hits on the radio but never purchased an album. This was my first purchase of his works and since I haved purchased three more. This album made me a fan..for life..more music van...
B000002MUN|5.0|This album takes me away from my life and puts me in a place where I can just be. One of his best, Wildflowers contains the core of relationship emotion and carries the listener from the brink of self satisfaction to the dangerous precipice of relationship death and back again to solid ground. The swirling emotional lyrics are pure Petty at his finest.     I cannot explain the intense physical and emotional reaction I have to most of the songs on this album, but it makes me want more. Wildflowers moves me. ... It just moves me.

B001DU8T6I|4.0|I think Lovato is cool as hell.  This album is great.  I highly recommend it to music fans, not just pop or Radio Disney fans.  The \\"Get Back\\" version on the disc is not the Radio Disney/video version, so it has the \\"kiss me\\" lyrics.  Oh yeah, kiss her indeed, as this girl has mucho potential!!<br /><br />By the way, a couple of jams have two former New Power Generation members performing on it, namely Tommy Barbarella (with the Purpleaxxe) and the drummer, Michael B.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Don't get me wrong, its an entertaining show, and at 20 bucks, you should definitely grab it.  To compare it to shows like Six Feet Under is absolutely ridiculous though.  The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential, IMO.  Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it, then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks.  This is a good DVD set though, I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer.  What can I say, don't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you won't be so disappointed.  For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter, AND two episodes of Brotherhood, and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature.  Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago.
0316035904|5.0|What else can you say, but it is yet another well written Sedaris book. I am always amazed at the wonderful sense of humor this writer has. Dark, dry sense of humor without sounding above it all.
B0017RV0PO|5.0|No cowboy hat came with costume, but I knew that going in.  My child bit the last cowboy hat so just as well.  Nice costume, short vest
B000OCZD5G|5.0|The movie itself really doesn't need much said about it, but I forgot how high this title set the bar.  I actually own the HD-DVD version, but this Blu-Ray version is basically identical.  Considering the age of the movie, the transfer looks great.  Far better production quality versus the DVD releases.  There were details in the video that I had completely overlooked.  Don't expect the big Lucasarts style soundtrack, but the audio quality is good enough to get the job done.  A great movie with a powerful and relevant political message to share with today's generation - if for no better reason to admire what was achieved in this movie without CGI effects.
1596434252|5.0|My husband opened up this book and immediately became protective of it!  He wanted to keep it just for himself.  Our 3 and 5 year old daughters couldn't wait to see it.  But, this is really a book for ages 6 and up.  ABC3D is not a child's ABC book by any means.  It needs to be handled delicately and some of the letters are not easy to see for a child under 5.  My children couldn't discern the u, j, and i.  For me (as an adult), the U was really eye catching.  It is a book of art that would best be enjoyed by adults and older children for the simplicity of its designs.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Normally, I am not fond of Nicole Kidman's acting abilities, but in this movie, I was pretty impressed with her skills in playing the part of Sylvia Broome a multilingual interpreter at the United Nations.    Sylvia Broome overhears a death threat against a controversial African leader, but is unable to identify the speaker due to the circumstances. She reports what she hears only to have the Secret Service not believe what she has to say. In fact, the Secret Service thinks Sylvia Broome may be a part of the plot her self as she has a reason not to like African political leader.    Sean Penn plays the part of Tobin Keller and is assigned to investigate Sylvia Broome to see if what she has to say has any merit what so ever. The movie becomes a fast paced, suspenseful, political thriller and is fun to watch!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Ever since the Black album, there has been a not so nice demon following this band around. The demon has been exersized and Metallica is full steam ahead!!!. This album requires at least a few thorough rounds in the player. When I first heard the sample songs, I thought \\"OK...this is not bad, but not great\\". Now,after multiple close listens, this CD rocks!!!  I am not a big fan of the instrumental song \\"Suicide Redemption\\", that is my only knock and not much of one. I could tell you the song by song reviews, but I'll leave that to the others. Being a musician, I can say James, Lars and Rob are just great on this! Kirk.....do all us a favor....put the wah-wah pedal away for god sake! We get the idea!!!! These songs are catchy and will be in your head at work, school and in your sleep. So, in closing, just do your self a big favor and go drop the few dollars for this. It's well worth it.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|If you're an old-school Metallica fan you'll love this album. It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in 20 years. You don't blame him for being out of touch or not looking quite the way he used to. You enjoy the fact that you're both still standing.      Here's where I'm coming from. I'm an old dude. I remember hearing Ride the Lightning when it was just released, and I've been with Metallica ever since. The first album, Kill `em All, was epoch-making, and Master was probably their height. I thought Justice was too sterile and the songs were needlessly long; I thought the Black Album was too commercial--though deep cuts like \\"The God that Failed,\\" \\"My Friend of Misery,\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\" were great. The change of sound and image with Load was very disappointing, but what was worse was the decline in quality. Combine the best 8 tracks from Load and Reload and you have one decent album. St. Anger likewise just wasn't very good--though I like \\"Frantic\\" and \\"St. Anger.\\" So that's where I'm coming from--whether you agree or not.        I was disappointed when I heard \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" before the CD's release. The song has too much of Load about it despite the great instrumental part at the end. But \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" actually sounds better in the context of the album where it plays the role of the slow song after three faster songs. Likewise I was disappointed with \\"Cyanide\\" when I heard the live version on Youtube. The studio version of \\"Cyanide\\" is much fuller and sounds much better. For my money \\"The Day that Never Comes\\"  and \\"Cyanide\\" are the two weakest tracks on the album. I won't go track by track, but trust me the rest is much better--fast, thrashy, and sneering.     If you're really into the current metal scene, don't expect this album to sound cutting edge. Metallica isn't trying to do their version of death metal or black metal. Metallica is just being Metallica in the best sense.     Never mind the clipping. It's true thatyou get some distortion at  high volumes, but it's nothing that ruins the album.     With Death Magnetic the prodigal son has returned. So let's slaughter the fatted calf and celebrate life.
B00132D808|2.0|The CD came in great condition and all, played well, original packaging, so the retailer did well, but the actual product? EH.  If you like Pop music in general then fine, this is Pop.  If you were a die-hard lover of the dark yet fun and super creative lyrics and music of the first album, like me! then you WILL be disappointed.  I love the first album and I feel like I lost a friend in P!ATD in this album.  If this is the direction they're taking, it's good Pop and all, but it's not the band we came to know.  Save yourself the trouble and just get the singles you like on iTunes.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Iv been a KOL fan for a while now but as soon as i put this album on it just struck a nerve and i haven't been able to stop listening. Its a more sedate album than their previous, but to me it seems much more sincere. Id recommend not only listening to the album but going on the kol website and watching the home videos, really adds another level to the recording. I know alot of reviewers are putting it down but in my opinion its no weaker, just different. If you only like bands that put out the same exact album over and over again with different titles this one is not for you.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Okay, I could have predicted all the poor reviews this album seems to be getting; KOL gets a stronger fan base and suddenly the critics and fans alike start aiming their weapons at their heroes.  Forget'em.  The people that don't get this album, well, don't get the band and should stay away from KOL.  Please.  This is a solid album, full of layered lyrics and awesome soundscapes.  I mean, so what if they opened for U2 and might have learned some tricks from The Edge?  That's a bad thing?  Jeez.  Grow a pair, people.  And who cares that it doesn't sound like their first album?  You know what?  Their second album didn't sound like their first album, but people accepted it.  Why?  Because most people hadn't heard their first album.  They went back to it after hearing the second album and then made the comparisons.  And the third album didn't sound like the second album.  But, you know what?  It was better.  Why?  Because they get stronger with every release.  They grow.  They expand.  You can't put a label on them and that's what displeases people.  They aren't easy.  It isn't brainless music.  I mean, imagine if Bob Dylan recorded the same type of sounding album every single time?  What if he never plugged in and recorded his ode to The Rolling Stones?  What if no one took any chances at changing their sound?  BORING.  Change; that's what is it about.  Embrace it.  This is the best band out there.  THEY WILL NEVER MAKE THE SAME ALBUM TWICE.  Enjoy them while they are around.  Buy this.  Listen to it.  Study it.  It is already misunderstood...and that is a fact.
1595141715|5.0|I have never enjoyed a book as much as this.  It's not funny.  It's not lighthearted.  Warning: It will actually make you think.  You will not see fresher writing anywhere else.  Only in books like \\"Just Listen\\" have I seen such honest speaking about something so serious, and this is the first one I've really read about suicide.  The subject matter is grim, yes, but it will without a doubt change your perspective on life.  Everyone can benefit from reading this amazing book.  I just can't stress enough the beauty of this book.  I can't.  It's heartbreakingly honest, captivating, and refreshing.  Just read it, please.<br />--SPOILERS--<br /><br />Did you expect Clay's chapter to  be anything but the last one?  I know I didn't.  Kind of amazing.  I wonder what will happen when Mr. Porter gets it.  Didn't see that coming, but it fit so well (because when have any of us been given helpful advice from a guidance counselor, right?)  I don't know about you, but Hannah's voice, even though she was dead, was the most real and raw thing I have ever experienced.  Asher is a brave, brave writer to say what he says, and I love him for it.  Everything just fit together so flawlessly.  I want to know more.  I want more tapes.  But just like Clay has to learn after everything is that she's gone, and there won't BE anymore.  And that's the heartbreak of the story.  This girl, this girl who had such a strong untold story, isn't just one girl.  This girl is representative of each and every one of us.  Everyone.  Don't you want to know the stories?  Are you strong enough to hear them?
B000V86OKG|2.0|Dexter's first season was pretty decent. His apathy and attitude towards life made the show interesting. In the second season, his personality changes into a regular guy who also happens to kill people. The killing isn't why I watched the first season, so this made the show uninteresting to me. You might call that change \\"growth\\". I call it de-evolution towards a stock character personality.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Let me first say that I am a huge Megadeth fan. Traditionally, there has been a bit of a feud between Megadeth and Metallica and a feud between their fans. HOWEVER, this album is INCREDIBLE! It sounds like it was made twenty years ago, durin the glory days of metal. Every song is powerful and hard. Incredible production, so tight! I have no idea how any hard rocker would not love this album! Broken, Beat and Scarred is the new anthem for metal.

B0007RT9LM|5.0|This is one of the best movies on the classic theme: \\"Good looking girl meets good looking guy and in the end live happily ever after.\\" This one is extra good because of the music, sensual insider language and the ideal club setting. You may call it a chick flick, but there are a lot of us sensual guys that have just as much craving for that perfect mating as girls. It's the only \\"Real\\" important thing in life.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|The Kings are one of my favorite bands, so start with the good:  It sounds like the Kings.  The spine of the music (bass, drums) is powerful and alive.    The bad: It smacks of a sell-out from a band who's previous releases came from an authentic place.  Someone else in these reviews made a statement that it's ludicrous for people to expect talented bands to stay the same, and that's a good point, but I think the expectation is that a band retains it's soul while continuing to be creative.  The lyrics here are embarrassingly bad.  The song structures are catchy, but I don't feel I'll be blasting them in the future like I still do w/ Aha Shake Heartbreak and Because of the Times.    These guys used to be cock rock...Now it's butt rock.  Sorry, but it is.  It's got The Kings sound, so it's good butt rock, but it still remains...    Three stars because I still sometimes sing along to whitesnake when it comes on the radio.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|This is nothing like their amazing debut album but then again this seems to be a band that continues to re-invent itself with each release.  Record #4 has the Kings a little more polished and mellow.  But it works.  Will everyone like it? No.  Their loss.
0767811070|5.0|Boyz N in the Hood is one of my favorite all time movies, when I saw how  cheap the price is on Amazon I ordered it.  John Singleton did a wonderful  job with this movie.  I love all the actors and actresses in the movie,  they were so believable playing their parts.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ice  Cube really delivered.  I would highly recommend this movie!!!

031606792X|1.0|I enjoyed reading the first 3 books in the Twilight series, and this one started out pretty good.  But, as I continued reading it, I found myself putting it down more often than picking it up.  With the first 3 books I couldn't put them down until I was finished, and it took me about 1-2 days to read each.  It took me over a month to finish Breaking Dawn.  The writing is kind of different than the rest of Meyer's books.  Sometimes it doesn't feel like she had her whole heart in it and that she was writing just to get the series finished.  Overall, this book was a disappointment to the series.  If I knew what I was getting myself into, then I would've stopped after book 3.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|Finally Metallica is done soul searching. Fall back in love with Metallica thanks to their latest effort, Death Magnetic. Load was a phenominal album, but deffinitely strayed away from the Metallica that we knew and loved.  Gone is the tin can snare. Back is the raw doom and gloom and head-bang inducing riffs.  Put your leather biker jacket back on, turn it up to 11 and throw those horned-hands in the air. Metallica is f****ing back.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|So KOL obviously want to expand their audience, and cross over into the mainstream rock world.  They succeeded.  This sounds like generic FM rock; formulaic, predictable, and bland.  It reminds me of a cross between Journey and Nickelback.  I would be embarrassed to play this in front of anyone, and I imagine most people over 15 years old would feel the same way.  Too bad, because their earlier stuff was pretty good.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I won't write a huge review like the others, but I would like to say that this is an extremely well written and directed series of films. Since I ordered this in 2007, I've watched it countless times. Waiting for it on BluRay...

They died bravely, and should be held in \\"high honor.\\"  The SEALS have a right to be arrogant, for they go through one of the most brutal training programs known to man, especially if over 100 good men quit the program. They pay for it.      Good book, Great Story.
B00005K3O4|3.0|Somehow, this film kept eluding me for years until I finally got it from Amazon two decades after it was made. Of course it is a cheap, campy, ridiculous B-movie... but it is very enjoyable at the same time.<br /><br />A spaceship looking like a circus tent lands on a small town. Aliens looking like monstrous clowns go on a rampage, attacking everybody and putting them on cotton candy cocoons from which they feed.<br /><br />Unbelievable? Yes. Improbable? Yes. With lots of unexplained twists? Yes. Some bad acting? Yes. Some cheap effects? Yes. Terribly dated? Yes.<br />...But STILL very funny to watch. And the clowns are nicely done. Only during the 80's a film like this could be made.<br /><br />Recommended for what it is.<br /><br />The DVD comes with an impressive array of extras:<br />-Deleted scenes<br />-Trailer<br />-Five featurettes (no less!)<br />-Interviews<br />-Photo gallery<br />-Storyboards<br />-Early films from the Chiodo Brothers<br />-Audio Commentary<br />-Bloopers<br />...And the copy I bought from Amazon comes with nice a 3D cover on the top of the original DVD case.<br /><br />Sadly, it does not come with English subtitles (why not?). Only French and Spanish.

0375826726|3.0|For some reason I had assumed that Brisingr was the third and final novel of the series. So I was a bit annoyed that after I finally made it to the end of this huge novel that there was still more to come.<br /><br />It was long. Very long. Some sections I thought weren't necessary and others lingered. It could have been shorter.<br /><br />That being said, like the other books in the series it was engaging and entertaining. I have read all three novels within a week and am enjoying them very much. I would recommend them and have bought them to read again in the future.<br /><br />I'm just annoyed I have to wait for the forth :(<br /><br />Hopefully the next isn't as long and doesn't spend so much time providing unecessary details.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|As a long time listener of Metallica, going back 26 years to the Kill `Em All album, I am proud to say that the most popular Metal band in existence have returned to their roots.  I love the heavy Metallica of old and ever since The Black Album have been a bigger fan of Slayer than Metallica, although I still occasionally throw in &#34;Modern Metallica&#34; and really like specific songs from Load, Reload etc.  Unlike many Metallica fans, I feel St. Anger was a superb experiment that requires many listens to appreciate.  That being said, Death Magnetic contains doses from ALL of their past efforts.  Metallica sound as relaxed and confident as ever and they use all of their past experience, including thrash metal (Kill Em All), The Black Album, St. Anger, And Justice For All to create ten songs of awesome, schizophrenic mayhem.  Many of the songs feel like they are five songs in one, as if they were created by a genius child with ADD.  It is said that each song was composed by all band members but as most fans already know, some members are more equal than others (Hetfield).  But this may explain the turning on a dime in direction of the riffs.  Somehow after several listens, each song comes together.  Songs go in many directions, reset themselves (like in Cyanide) and then finish leaving you wanting more (even though most are more than seven minutes long).  There is a kind of low tech mixing, rough and grungy, which must be on purpose (it is kind of like Maiden's first album), that gives you instant feedback that you are not listening to any Metallica album of old, although you hear riffs that could have been written at any time in their career.  Rick Rubin has once again done a wonderful job!  As many of you know, he is the man who brought Reign in Blood to the planet.  Hammett is unleashed and sounds better than ever (again I hear a little Maiden influence showing up, which I don't really recall in the past)!  Ulrich has laid down some of his best skin bashing ever and you won't be able to stop &#34;air drumming.&#34;  Several songs have the drums in front and the guitars follow beautifully.  Hetfield has written some great, catchy, Black Album like lyrics that you will find yourself singing / screaming to.  Favorites for me are The Day That Never Comes (Hammett sounds awesome!) and All Nightmare Long (great head banging tune).  But there really isn't a weak song on the record in my opinion.  You will want to purchase the entire album not just download a few songs.  And this comes from a guy who usually only downloads three or four songs of any given album.  This album will require many more listens to appreciate (it is not nearly as accessible to the masses as The Black Album) as each hidden goodie manifest itself in our consciousness, much like Reign in Blood.  I have a hunch that it will reveal its greatness to fans and the masses in the long run.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I couldn't agree more with the three reviews already listed on here. They all hit the nail on the head. The recording sounds just as clear as a studio album and the performance itself is a feast for the eyes. The orchestra, choir, guest performers and wild stage show related stuff (I don't want to spoil it) are just amazing.<br /><br />This is one of the better looking/sounding concert DVDs out and I have a bunch to compare it to. The extra features are short in nature, but fun to watch.<br /><br />I do wish the US version was available on Blu-ray like the one in Europe, but you get the full 22 song concert on DVD and 13 songs on the CD for under $20.00. You can't pass on this deal.<br /><br />All in all, this is a must have for fans of Within Temptation. Buy it already!
0316010669|5.0|An excellent book, just as good as Gladwell's previous landmark, \\"The Tipping Point,\\" \\"Blink\\" is fascinating in the confirmation that \\"thin slice\\" first impressions are more than intuitive, they are the results of subconscious factual significant experience and realities, and in many cases subconscious bias.  Interesting too, is the evidence that we can think \\"too much\\" and counter our \\"intuitive\\" knowledge judgments with obfuscating factual study - \\"introspection destroyed people's ability to solve insight problems\\" and, as is quoted, \\"what happens is that we come up with a plausible-sounding reason for why we might like or dislike something, and then we adjust our true preference to be in line with that plausible-sounding reason.\\"  I especially like the section on focus groups, how results on \\"first impressions\\" can be very wrong, \\"We like market research because it provides certainty...but the truth is that for the most important decisions, there can be no certainty\\" says Gladwell.  I particularly like the example of how the Aeron chair by Herman Miller failed every focus group rating it took on looks, and \\"likely to purchase\\" reviews, yet became the best selling chair in the company's history (and then focus groups reversed their scores), ditto audience reaction to the best selling situation comedies of their time, \\"All in the Family\\" and \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\\"  Applying the analysis to a polarizing product today in the automotive industry, as someone who is looking at the launch of the new reaction creating Ford Flex vehicle (September 23, 2008), I'm wondering whether or not what Gladwell said about the initial \\"looks\\" rating for the Aeron chair is true for the new Ford Crossover in the looks department - that is, as its very different looking, \\"Maybe the word `ugly' was just a proxy for `different.\\" And when people get familiar with the `difference'  time will change perception (as it did with the Ford Taurus over two decades ago).  It will be interesting to see how this \\"real world\\" example of Gladwell's observations rolls out.g to see how this \\"real world\\" example of Gladwell's observations rolls out.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I'm sure most of you are aware of the mixing problems on this album. It's SO unfortunate, because in my opinion this is Metallica's best album since ...and justice for all.  The songs are not laid out like typical songs (verse, chorus, verse).  It's more like long instrumental intro, verse, pre-chorus, jam, chorus, solo, jam, solo, outtro. Personally, I like songs like that - it's very old school Metallica.  All the songs are longer than 7 minutes - they're like mini rock operas.  The playing is furious and tight, and finally Kirk is playing solos again (unlike the completely awful St. Anger). The lyrics are pretty bad, and Hetfield's voice strains and sounds tired. But overall, the songs are just awesome.<br /><br />The reason for three stars is that there is NO EXCUSE for an album to have this bad of mastering in 2008. First off, it's LOUD. When I say loud, I mean that I play all my CDs at level 14 or 15 in my Bose car stereo, and this album I have to turn down to level 11 to make it listenable without earmuffs. It's just so overdriven. The intense volume makes it sound very DISTORTED.  For those that say it's not there, even the person who mixed the album, Ted Jensen, admitted that there were unacceptable amounts of distortion and audio clipping. It's being discussed all over the Metallica forums.<br /><br />Still don't believe me?  Turn up the last 20 seconds of \\"The Day that Never Comes\\".  It will sound like your speakers are blown.<br /><br />It's a complete disgrace to have such a great album of songs marred by such abominable mixing. We all know that the members of Metallica are deaf, but we trust they aren't the ones mixing the album, right?<br /><br />Hopefully there will be such a backlash that something will be done, and they will release a \\"remastered\\" version of their album that is a week old.  Here's to hoping...

B00005JPAO|5.0|As a Yank from across the pond, I only recently caught THE QUEEN and I'm disappointed I didn't see it sooner!<br /><br />This is one of those great films based on true incidents that constantly leaves you wondering, \\"Did that really happen?\\"<br /><br />The movie follows what happens following the death of Princess Diana, skillfully showing how the Royals, the new British government, and the media/public respond to the tragedy.  Actual news footage and interviews with Diana only make it seem more real, as well as the characterizations of everyone on the screen.<br /><br />Some come off worse, others better.  I don't know.  Whatever the reality of what took place was, this is a very well-crafted, very compelling story.  I've always loved Helen Mirren.  She was a total Shakespeare babe in the 1970s (I saw some recent paparazzi shots of her in a bikini and she's still got it!), she's been great in everything I've seen her, and I'm thrilled she won the Oscar for THE QUEEN.<br /><br />One last note: as bad as the Royals come off in some scenes, especially Prince Philip railing about Diana and outraged that \\"homosexuals will be singing in Westminster\\" (Elton John's #1 song), I wondered if the British press was getting a bit of a pass: whenever I saw online papers from England, they were aghast and appalled at Diana's activities right up until she died (chased by the press, no less).  Diana found ways of using the press herself--sunbathing in bikinis whenever Charles accompanied Camilla Parker-Bowles out on the town--but I thought they were terrible to her otherwise.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|I would not classify this as a horror movie. It was not scary or gory to me at all. I think suspense might be a better description. It had one of the most creepy movie scores for it's time, and even now for that matter. The atmosphere, the creepy music, the killing scene at the beginning, and the amazingly vivid and colorful scenes make this a really good movie. I'm amazed this movie was made in 1977, and I'm glad I caught this on IFC a few years back, or I never would have heard of this movie.
B001FXCE46|5.0|This band has amazed me with each album--often compared to the NY band \\"The Strokes\\", Kings of Leon sets themselves aside by revolutionizing their distinct sound and creating melody filled songs every time. This album picks up where \\"Because of the Times\\" left off into a more uplifting tranquility that still manages to bob your head off beat. I guarantee if you are an Indie Rock fan this album will not disappoint--the single \\"Crawl\\" does not do its justice. To be quite honest I could not tell you my favorite song. I really like \\"I Want You, Sex On fire, Use Somebody, Manhattan, Revelry, 17 and Be Somebody. Each track is composed with edgy riffs and compilations that make each track distinct and memorable.  Combined with soulful lyrics, Caleb's unique vocals, and melodies each track will have you humming far after the album stops. Best 10 dollars and hour invested. Can't wait till the next album.
B00000JSJC|5.0|I loved this movie, if nothing else because it is one of the few times that Ralph Fiennes leaves behind the glacial, remote,untouchable persona of so many of his roles.  Yeah,he's kind of greasy at first, but by the end, his eyes are so soft,his face so emotive with love for his friend and desperation to do the right thing.<br /><br />Plus, this was- at the time, the only modern movie where a beautiful White man, realizes he loves a beautiful Black woman-  a woman he respects and has always been his friend. No skanky sex shenanigans here (at least not between these two- Juliette takes care of that part!)!<br /><br />There was so much hoopla about Y2K-  people really thought there would be riots, and such. I stayed home, and they had the entire police force out on 6th street in Austin, for fear of trouble! So, it fit the time as pop entertainment.<br /><br /> Now, well, it's kind of tired, but Ralph is still so tender and tormented, a regular kind of screwed up guy- I watch it again, and again just to see him.
B0001WGDXK|5.0|Even if I am a great admirer of Bernstein's communication skills and his relationship with the orchestras and the public, I have to admit that the quality of his recordings is quite uneven. Sometimes I am flabbergasted by the brilliance and superb taste, but unfortunately very often Bernstein's recordings suffer from sloppy execution. In the 80s, he recorded a lot for DG, btw, always from a live performance, and in almost every piece he conducted, his tempos were on the slow side, resulting in what people called as \\"self indulgent Bersntein\\".<br /><br />In the case of this Sibelius, I really don't care if these performances were result of a self indulgent Bernstein or Joe Doe. All I can say is that they are, simply put, the best Sibelius symphonies I've ever heard.<br /><br />#1 - I think that the success of this performance is due to the fact that Bernstein felt very at ease with these tempos and the overall atmosphere of this symphony. At the end of the first movement, for example, I always fell that I am at a Jewish wedding party. The second movement is not dragged as in some other recordings. The short scherzo makes the bridge to the powerful fourth movement (the crescendo of the transition is extremely well executed). A flawless performance.<br /><br />#2 -The second movement is a little bit too slow, but it is still a remarkable achievement. However, for this symphony I prefer HvK recording for EMI from the late 70s (or early 80s, I am not sure). The Berliners brass is just too good to ignore (even for the Viennese standards). If it wasn't for that, this Bernstein would have been my favorite recording.<br /><br />#5 - I am not big fan of this symphony. By coincidence, this is the only symphony that I've heard from the - somehow - more famous Bernstein's Sibelius cycle in the 60's with the NYPO. IMO, both recordings have similar approach to the work.<br /><br />#7 - My favorite. I tried Haitink, Davis, Karajan (from the 50s, 60s, 70s), Rattle (which I saw live with the Berliners on an outstanding concert in San Francisco a few years ago), Ashkenazy, Vanska and the latest Jarvi. No one comes close with building and releasing the tensions, which basically what this symphony is about. The Vienna string section is a big help. I hope it doesn't sound like clich&eacute;, but I really cannot express in words the success of this performance.cert in San Francisco a few years ago), Ashkenazy, Vanska and the latest Jarvi.

055358894X|5.0|This is my favorite book of the last several years and I probably read 20+/year (mostly fantasy).  The book moves along very quickly with a caper like quality to it that was unlike any book I have every read.  The plot was ingeniously put together even though at times it did stretch plausibility.  While certain aspects of the book could have been better developed, such as magic and several of the characters, it did nothing to detract from the story and leaves a lot of room for development in further books.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and have loaned it out to several friends who greatly enjoyed it as well.  I look forward to more from Mr. Lynch.
B001E75QGG|2.0|Wow, leave it to George Lucas to ruin a franchise. The only 2 good ideas he's ever had Star Wars and Indiana Jones, have been completely ruined by him. KOTCS is full of cheesy affects (I hate those Monkeys),and  horrible dialogue.     The only terrific thing in this movie is Harrison Ford. The man, the legend is back and manages to salvage this CGI mess.     Seriously, why so much CGI??? Take a lesson from movies like The Dark Knight and just use old fashion film making.    If there will be a 5th, I'm all for it, but keep Lucas out.

B000WC4A8O|5.0|I hesitated for about 2 seconds before spending $60 on a 4-LP box set, but man was it worth it!  The remastering quality is top rate - it's not like they just \\"cleaned up\\" the originals.  Levels, channels and fades have all been reworked.  I put on the record and played several tracks simultaneously to the 4-CD box set from 20 yrs ago (switching the input selector back and forth).  It's like night and day, you wouldn't believe the improvement if you didn't hear it.  Dazed and Confused is the perfect track for comparison with the huge dynamic range and monster drum riffs.  The drum mix is the biggest improvement with the new master - they go from muddy and flat on the old CD mix to crisp and 3-dimensional on the new vinyl.    I'm listening through a high-end Rega Mira3 amp and Rega Apollo CD, Technics SL-1200MK2 TT with AT120 elliptical stylus and Paradigm Studio 20 loudspeakers.

There were so many delightful surprises in it, its a wonder of papercraft engineering that will delight for years to come.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|I came into SPEED RACER expecting an overblown, over CG'd attempt at a big budget popcorn movie that failed... just like the critics said. What I ended up seeing was a lot of critics who had it right and in some aspects had it very wrong.<br /><br />First of all, SPEED RACER is actually a pretty good movie that really only went wrong, in my opinion, in one place. It's isn't a great action movie, but it's dazzling in a lot of ways. First of all, the quirkiness of the movie was unsettling at first.... the many race commentors ranting and raving in different languages was strange. The cartoonish demeanor and delivery of lines and entire scenes was, at first, strange, but ultimately, I found them neat. Different. Different is always good.<br /><br />The color scheme was almost too blown out. Every single scene, every setting, every turn of the camera has you looking at a backdrop that looks like it was ripped out of a Van Gogh painting. This movie would be awesome for potheads.<br /><br />SPEED RACER was trying to be a cartoonish live action film and it succeeded in many aspects, but one thing bugged me to no end. The race scenes were fast furious and jarring, but much of it went by so fast that you wish they would slow down a skew just to get a good grasp as to what just happened. Why did he spin out of control? Who the heck is this person trying to run him off the road?<br /><br />Remember when the new Star Wars movies came out and they were over CG'd. We remember the original Star Wars and how REAL it looked... and then the new movie looked like the same sort of thing you can get with your PS2. SPEED RACER is 10x that. OVER CG'd to the hilt. Over CG'd beyond its time. It tried to be ground breaking... but ultimately was overkill.<br /><br />It's a good movie with 1 less star for the hyperactive scenes that left you wishing they had more tact than ego.

0385736002|4.0|Readers grade 5/6 and up may enjoy this fast-paced mix of myths, the myriad of characters, the inclusion of modern gadgets and the easy sentence structure. However, most characters are flat, cliffhangers at the end of each chapter remind us of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", and the author's habit of endlessly repeating facts and sentences really spoils the fun.  The author doesn't give anyone the smallest change to wonder about the character's feelings or motivations: We are being TOLD, without mercy!  Events are piled up, monster upon monster, challenge upon challenge, barely time to catch a breath and all in two days' time. No wonder, the main characters- the \\"twins of legend\\" (and don't you dare forget it!) Sophie and Josh, are exhausted all the time and Nicholas Flamel ages before our very eyes.   And yet, I will probably read the sequel to find out what happened to Scatty.....
B0001HAISG|4.0|What can I say, my sons loves the film. He watches it at least once a week if not more.
B001AZIRZY|1.0|My wife and I watched the first two \\"As the Wrench Turns\\" shows on PBS.  After the first one, I was so disappointed that I was ready to give up on it.  My wife thought we should give it another try.  We convinced ourselves that later episodes might be better.  So we watched the second one.  After that, neither of us cared if we ever saw another one.<br /><br />The plots were boring; the humor was flat; the characters were annoying; and the animation was amateurish.  It appeared that each show might be trying to convey a message, but they were never able to clearly state their point.<br /><br />A previous reviewer talked about the shows' \\"complex adult political themes\\".  I sit here with my mouth agape wondering what show he was watching.  I guess those themes were sort of there (that \\"message\\" I mentioned earlier), but the shows did little to advance those themes.  All they really did was tap dance around them.  Maybe that's why they're called the Tappet brothers.<br /><br />The only parts of the experience that I enjoyed were the short one-minute segments with Tom and Ray themselves talking about the hazards of driving while talking on the phone or while eating.  There may have been more of these bits on subsequent weeks.  I don't know; like I said, I quit watching.  And I don't know if these segments are on the DVD.<br /><br />If you are like me and watch a large variety of funny or entertaining or enlightening shows, \\"As the Wrench Turns\\" will seem stale and bland by comparison to just about anything.  There are so many better shows available.  Why bother with this?<br /><br />Oh, but don't give up on their radio show; that's still very entertaining!

B001DPC52C|5.0|I'm usually wary of live performance albums. The goal of live performances is to give a fantastic performance for the audience attending with a CD/DVD release being secondary. Most live recordings I hear suffer from the fact that you just can't have a microphone everywhere. This causes the mix between vocals, instruments and audience to be very uneven. Sometimes an artist will get cute with their songs. Sometimes it's simply the fact that it is a live album and mistakes will be made that you simply can't edit out.    Sometimes you get a performance that breaks the mold and delivers a good CD/DVD performance as well: Simon and Garfunkle's concert in the park, Metallica's S&M concert. But these breakings of the mold are usually the exception to the rule.    Within Temptation doesn't just break the mold with Black Symphony, they shatter it. This is quite easily the best live performance album I've heard, bar none. The mix between symphony, singing and audience is amazing. It could very well rival what would come out of a studio. Sharon's singing is flawless from beginning to end of this more than 2-hour concert. If there were any mistakes made, I certainly didn't notice them.     The lighting, the pyrotechnics, the orchestra, camera movement, Sharon's own knowledge of how to please the crowd, all of it works together to deliver an amazing event. If it was this amazing in my own living room, I could only imagine what it was like really being there. A previous review says he wouldn't describe the entire concert in his review because he didn't want to ruin it. I won't describe the entire concert in my review simply because words fail.     No, this is not an exaggeration. This is not just the sycophantic praise of a fan that thinks WT can do no wrong. This is an honest review of someone who has listened to many a live recording and has been left cold by all but a few. The production costs to make this album must have been through the roof, because nowhere have I heard an audio mix from a live show work as well as this. Nowhere have I seen camera work done as flawlessly.  No were have I seen a live event get captured so well on camera. This is a must have for Within Temptation fans. I'd say it's a must have for anyone who wants to see definitively how live recordings should be done.

0962477060|5.0|The bottom line is: this book will do more for your playing confidence than anything else you can invest in (that is, if you don't already have expert knowledge of the fretboard). I have mainly played rhythm until now, but even my band members are amazed at my lead progress and the varieties I add the rhythm. Get it, learn it, and your confidence on the guitar will grow.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|This is a movie I grew up watching, so being able to find it on DVD, and for such a low price,was fantastic.  Maybe not a great movie per se, but it appealed to my nostalgia.  Fast shipping and great service, as always.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is amazing. Very well acted. Very romantic. A wonderful story of friendship and love. The actors had chemistry, I watched this move 6 times already. The best gay love story since brokeback mountain.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I think this albums is just awesome from start to end. It took me about two listens before I was fully in love, but Re: Stacks and Skinny Love were instant hits with me. Obviously, if you only like upbeat music this isn't for you. Most of the songs feature little more than simple percussion and acoustic guitar. The sparsity of instrumentals means you really need to be into the singing style, which despite some other reviewers, I think is unique and awesome. Usually I don't like a chorus of one person tracked on top of itself, but I think he pulls it off pretty well.
B0012Q732O|3.0|I looked forward to watching this movie with great anticipation.  Unfortunately, after viewing it, I felt like I had been cheated.  I found the story somewhat difficult to follow, and I had a difficult time with the dialogue.    As for the movie's story, D'Leh (Steven Strait) is a young leader in his tribe.  Despite his father's betrayal to the tribe years ago, D'Leh has risen to a rank of leadership.  He has proven to be a fine hunter and is adept at handling a spear as well as hunting mastadons.  He has grown to love Evolet (Camilla Belle), a young, blue-eyed woman who was taken in by the tribe.  However, their dream of being together is shattered as the \\"four-legged demons\\" rampage through the camp and take hostages who are to become slaves in the serice of \\"the Almighty\\".    Throughout the film, D'Leh tracks the intruders who took his beloved Evolet.  His journey takes him from the heights of mountains to the depths of the jungle, and across the desert.  Along the way, D'Leh recruits the assistance of other peoples who have been put asunder by the almighty's minions.  Ultimately, D'Leh and his army reach the stronghold of the Almighty and his followers.  A great battle ensues, but will D'Leh and Evolet survive and finally be together?     Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this film.  There are some very good parts, including the mastadon hunt, the race to escape from the large ostrich-like birds, and the encounter with the saber-toothed tiger.  But, unfortunately, these moments are cancelled out by many others that are not as good.  I can only give this movie an average rating.  If you're looking for a good film with loads of action, look somewhere else besides \\"10,000 B.C.\\"
031606792X|5.0|I accidentally picked up the first in this series and decided to read it over fall break. What a surprise it was to me that I would LOVE the storyline and all of the characters. I read all four books in five days. After I read the books I went on-line as was so disappointed to find that the most helpful post was SO negative. The storyline was great!! So what if it had a happy ending. I cried through half of the second book and a good bit of this one! The characters were all so developed that I could imagine meeting any one of them. It is nice to finish a book and feel sad because you know that the story is over... not because the main character had a tragic ending. If you want a story that ends tragically, read Romeo and Juliet. On the other hand, if you just want a great read, dive in!!
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Based on the highly successful cartoon series from the 1960s, \\"Speed Racer\\" delivers a knockout punch sure to rev up everyone's engine.    As a young boy, Speed always looked up to his older brother Rex (Scott Porter).  Rex was a highly successful driver who became legendary with his thrilling driving.  However, Rex became involved with some corporate sponsors who believed racing was all about money.  Rex was now viewed by his fellow drivers as being reckless as well as a thug who was only racing to make money.  So, Rex decided to fake his own death.    Meanwhile, Speed (Emile Hirsch) has become a very good driver in his own right.  He has shown the natural ability to win races at the highest level.  This talent has been noticed by E.A. Royalton (Roger Allam), owner of Royalton Racing.  E.A. has decided to try to lure Speed into signing on with his team.  Speed and his family are wooed by Royalton, and soon, Speed is asked to sign on.  He declines, deciding rather to stay on with his father's (John Goodman) independent team.    Speed's decision infuriates Royalton to no end, and he vows to ruin Speed and Racer Racing at all costs.  But, Speed, with the help of Trixie (Christina Ricci) and Racer X (Matthew Fox) have a plan of their own in mind for Royalton.  Will they be successful?    This is a first-rate movie.  The special effects are some of the best I've seen, and the acting is very good as well.  All of the familiar names from the TV series are included.  Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his sidekick Chim-Chim still manage to get themselves into loads of mischief.  Sparky (Kick Gurry) helps keep the Mach 5 and later, Mach 6, in tip top shape.  Inspector Detector is on the job trying to solve the affairs of Royalton Racing.  Other well-known Speed Racer characters such as Cruncher Block and Snake Oiler make appearances in the movie, too.    I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The special effects are terrific, and seeing the old names again is loads of fun.  Don't miss Speed Racer; its a high-speed rush to the finish line!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|NOTE: Opinions vary but MY review is designed to help those who haven't purchased the product decide whether or not they want to. If you disagree, write a review--the comments section IS for that but not the voting system.<br /><br />A marvelous restoration job, \\"The Godfather-The Coppola Restoration Gif Set\\" includes all three original films as they were presented theatrical. It doesn't have the version that Coppola cut for TV and presented in chronological order. THe first two films are masterpieces and while the third is severely flawed, it does have its moments.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these were restored for theatrical showings NOT for the home video market and, as such, these probably aren't the best Blu-rays to use to show off your home video system. Some people will no doubt be disappointed but, quite frankly, these films have never looked this good before on home video. Is this a big step up from the DVDs? Yes and no. The Blu-ray does provide better resolution but keep in mind it also shows the flaws inherent in the original films (and some people will regard the grainy images as being a flaw).<br /><br />First keep in mind that \\"The Godfather\\" was meant to look grainy so those of you who hate grain will probably wonder why they didn't eliminate it.  That's because to do so would have required altering the look of the film not restoring it and the usual result of eliminating film grain is that you lose detail. The result also makes it look like the actors are walking wax dummies. Some scenes are much grainer than others but that's the way the film was meant to look.<br /><br />According to Harris in an article at American Cinematographer, the original film was in extremely bad shape and, in some instances, frames from outtakes had to be subsituted because damage had crept into the frame area of the film.<br /><br />\\"The Godfather Part II\\" was in better shape for a variety of reasons and didn't require quite as much work on it as the first film.<br /><br />\\"The Godfather Part III\\" since it used different development techniques from the first three (and for other reasons you can read at the American Cinematographer website)and only required Harris to match the black levels and make sure the color scheme was done correctly.<br /><br />Robert Harris has done a marvelous job on the restoration of the film. Colors are bolder than before with nice crisp images as cinematographer Gordon Willis originally shot the film. While the DVD looks terrific, the Blu-ray looks positively stunning. Does it look like a film released last year? No, of course not that would be impossible but Harris working with Coppola and Willis has brought the film into the 21st century without overprocessing the image (like the recent Blu-ray \\"Patton\\")and staying true to the original look of the original film elements if they were in pristine condition.<br /><br />All of the previous extras from the boxed set have been ported over in HD along with some new extras including \\"The Masterpiece That Almost Wasn't\\" documenting the difficult birth of the film from Paramount asking Puzo to initially change the period setting to 1970's Los Angeles to the constant threat of Coppola being fired during the shooting of the film. \\"When the Shooting Stops\\" covers the post-production efforts of editing and scoring the film.<br /><br />THe humorous \\"Godfather World\\" has famous directors illustrated the cultural impact of the film and features bits and pieces from \\"The Simpsons\\" to \\"South Park\\".\\"Emulsion Rescue documents Robert Harris' restoration efforts of the aging film elements. \\"Four Short FIlms of \\"The Godfather\\" is amusing as well.<br /><br />The 12 page booklet included with the Blu-ray was clearly designed for the DVD because it's much too large to fit in the Blu-ray holder (it's glued to the outside packaging). It's odd to design the booklet like this as you'll have to either trim it down to fit inside, slide it in where it might possible become creased orstore it separately to prevent wear and tear. It has a bit of info on the Oscars for the films and the credits. It's an odd extra to include because it doesn't have anything truly essential NOT included on the Blu-ray or DVD boxed set.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this compelling saga on Blu-ray and DVD. It's a huge improvement on the previous set, has new and previously released extras (including Coppola's often blunt commentary tracks)and looks terrific. For those looking for the TV version that ran in chronological order just be aware it's not here as part of this set although many of the deleted scenes used to assemble that one are included.Oscars for the films and the credits.

0452289963|4.0|This book goes where few books go in terms of both depth of thought and spiritual insight.<br /><br />Aiuthor Eckart Tolle provides thoughtful perspective on the ultimate questions about life. The book describes how to connect with your true conscious, or essentially God, by rising above the stream of thoughts that occupy our minds.<br /><br />I read the book very slowly. Usually I just read one section, 1-2 pages a day, so I could reflect on what was said.<br /><br />On the negative side, I felt that the book spent too much time covering the ego, and its negative aspects. I felt it got a little repetitive.<br /><br />However, there are so many brilliant nuggets in the book, that it's easy to overlook this minor flaw.<br /><br />As I flip through the book and revisit some of the parts I underlined, some of the best quotes include:<br /><br />-heaven is not a location but refers to the inner realm of consciousness<br /><br />-everything is not only connected with everything else, but also with the Source of all life out of which it came<br /><br />-medical treatment is the third-leading cause of death<br /><br />-not what you do but how you do what you do determines whether you are fulfilling your destiny<br /><br />-make sure your vision or goal is not an inflated image of yourself and therefore a concealed form of ego, such as wanting to be a movie star, a famous writer, or a wealthy entrepreneur. Instead see your self inspiring countless people with your work and enriching their lives. (Yikes! As a writer that one hit home with me.)<br /><br />Living in the present is a key component of Tolle's philosophy. As Indian spiritual teacher J. Krishnamurti said \\"This is my secret, I don't mind what happens.\\" He was in alignment with the present moment no matter what it was.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for answers to the big questions in life, or just some really good food for thought, this book is well worth reading.<br /><br />Other recommended reading:<br />Create Your Own Reality - The Ancient WisdomCreate Your Own Reality - The Ancient Wisdom
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I got this Blu-ray as part of a free offer with my new Sony Blu-ray player and I have to say it is a purchase that just keeps on giving. One reviewer complained about the sound and image. I think the sound is great. The image was also as good as get for an on stage performance. Yes at times you see a bit of grain in the lights but that is more ambiance than defect. Low light recording does produce artifacts even in high defintion. The amount of music on this disc is huge as is its diversity as he plays solo and with two different bands. Great buy!
0761536434|4.0|TUHOVG is a long and intriguing book that covers the earliest interactive computer experiments and progresses pseudo-chronologically through each major movement up to the start of the new millennium.  The account provided for the early years of gaming is particularly detailed and well crafted while the details on gaming history post-80's lacks the same luster.  Kent's \\"History\\" is more a history of the business decisions and financial climates under which the gaming industry thrived and suffered and much less an account of the particular games, game designers, and technological breakthroughs that marked the milestones in the progression of the art form.  Ultimately, Kent provides the reader with a wealth of research and interviews, warranting the 4-star rating given by this reviewer.  While Kent steers clear of pandering to the hardcore gamer crowd in this volume, he also proves to lack deep or unique insights into the nature of the Video Game form.
B000002I2M|3.0|3 1/2    Although The Doors final entry had a few songs that could hang with the best of their catalog (obviously the ones that went on to be hits) those songs almost feel like intuitive last-chance stabs at audio immortality in an attempt to raise the vibe of these creatively limited final recording sessions.
0743290119|2.0|This book was interesting. I was expecting it to be really great...I love chic lit novels. However, I started to read it and realized it was a really slow read. The plot was okay, but wasn't really interesting until the very end of the book. Also, the language was pretty bad.     I gave it two stars because of the language and sex.
B00001U0DP|4.0|A wonderful story to illustrate a father teaching his son that life is a game... that can be won if you guard your heart and grow your attitude. A concentration camp can't stop the father-son bond because of the dynamic principle of making the choice to have an incredible attitude.<br /><br />No matter what you are facing today, this story will inspire you to face it with a new found courage to see the beautiful gifts that are often over-looked by those too busy or worried to see the joy. My perspective on life was broadened by watching this amazing story. I believe that your life will be blessed as well.<br /><br />Here's a great coaching tip.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|A lot of people are forgetting that the music from \\"Love\\" was actually made for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. Having said that I think \\"Love\\" is a great work for a Cirque du Soleil show and, even though I haven't watched the show, it seems to me that the music is fitting for it. Listening to it I could just imagine what kind of acrobatics and tricks would be performed to the music, which tells me that the music did what it was supposed to do.      I speak as a Beatles fan when I say this, George Martin did an amazing job. It's hard to imagine how difficult it must be for someone who worked so closely with the songs to come up with such innovative and fresh remixes.     Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing (anyone catch that Taxman solo in there?) and Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows stand out for me the most. However I found myself listening attentively to all of the songs trying to identify the various snippets and overlaps, and I was surprised to find so many of them hidden seamlessly into the songs.      Of course as a Beatles fan it can be cringe-inducing to hear our beloved tunes changed and tampered with in this manner, and yes there were some parts here and there that I found hard to accept. Overall though I would say this was a successful project because it was able to fulfill it's ultimate goal, which was to create great music for the Cirque du Soleil show and NOT necessarily to adhere to Beatles fans. George Martin deserves a lot of credit.
B000AYELVA|4.0|The special effects are good. The characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want. Welcome to Carrie, Christine, Firestarter, the Tommyknockers and many other Stephen King paranormal beings and situations. Of course, this film adds to that berserk universe a good old American wrapping but with a twist. The statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky  and jutting out of a flat no man's seascape. The twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the United Nations for the general assembly of this world's forum. This American wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants, against people who are different, who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible. And the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants, transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them. And before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them. Finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film, temporarily, they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutant-dom. Then the rest is not even sentimental episodes. It is pure action and mission and some fights, and a lot of visual special effects. That makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain Quasimodo in Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo: the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal Parisians want to victimize and kill.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is arguably Leone's masterpiece (even though some prefer the magisterial Once Upon a Time in America).  It is one of the most astounding Westerns ever made.  It can stand next to any of the great Westerns (Stagecoach, The Searchers, Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch), and it is such a unique, moving, and brilliant experience that you can see this film over and over again, and it never gets boring.<br /><br />After Leone's \\"dollars\\" trilogy was wildly successful (and is still adored today), Paramount decided to bring Leone to America and let him direct the ultimate Western.  This is the masterpiece he came up with.  Leone wrote the original story with the great Bernardo Bertolucci and the great, underrated Dario Argento.  It has one of the greatest (and longest) opening credits sequences in movie history, and it's also one of the most tension filled and actually quite funny at times.  It also has one of the most cold blooded villians in Western history, played brilliantly against type by Henry Fonda.  Reportedly, when Fonda accepted the film (based on his friend Eli Wallach's endorsement of Leone and Fonda's screening of the dollars films), he grew a mustache and got brown contact lenses.  When Leone saw this, he said \\"no, no, no!\\".  He wanted the Fonda that the American movie going public loved to be the villian.<br /><br />One can't talk about this film without mentioning the great score by Ennio Morricone.  It's one of the most famous scores in movie history, and Leone's and Morricone's relationship is one of the most unique in cinema history.  Rarely has a composer and director been so closely linked (and done so well together) like Morricone and Leone.  The film has one of the greatest final shootouts in movie history, but it's made even greater by the music score.  Leone was so taken by Morricone's music (who wouldn't be?) that he played the score during the actual final shootout so Charles Bronson (who is excellent as Harmonica) and Fonda would move to the music like a ballet.<br /><br />The film is surprisingly realistic in its depiction of the West.  Many American critics hated the spaghetti Westerns, but this was extremely shortsighted.  Leone's films are actually far more realistic than many more famous Westerns.  The clothing worn by the men of Cheyenne (played brilliantly by Jason Robards) were long, yellow dusters.  Many asked Leone where he got the idea from.  He said he went back to the original source.  Men didn't wear the tight leather pants and fancy cowboy outfits as much as Hollywood would lead you to believe.  The dusters worn in Once Upon a Time in the West were worn because they were very practical for cowboys to wear.  They shielded them from the rain and kept them warm during the cold nights in the desert.  The trading post scene is also very realistic.  It's very dimly lit, like it would be back in the old West.  Leone was very well read on the West, and maybe there was some resentment from old timers that this upstart Italian director knew more about the West than they did.<br /><br />It's quite ironic that the first time I saw this film, I didn't fully get it, but something said to try again.  I did this, and the film got better each time I saw it.  Paramount stupidly cut it from 165 minutes to 144 in its initial theatrical run (it was restored for VHS, laser, and DVD releases to its original 165 minute running time), and it really tanked at the American box office.  But it was a major hit in Europe, especially France, where the dusters worn by Cheyenne became a fashion phenomenon and the film ran in Paris cinemas continually for FOUR years.  The film is also beautifully paced.  As Leone's career progressed, his films became longer, more leisurely paced, and quite melancholic and contemplative (especially his final film Once Upon a Time in America), and this one is a prime example of the genius of Sergio Leone.et.

0783226888|5.0|One of the films of the mid-1990s  when America had gotten out of its anti-Russian paranoia after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Russians and the Americans are working together against international terror-mongers. A real cocktail. The Russian mafia, slightly Georgian and Caucasian in those days (for the Americans, see Red Heat), the Basque separatist gone underground, the IRA getting little by little out of the closet and back on the political turf, and then the free-lance American adventurers who are doing it for the pleasure of killing in the most visible and gross way possible. But we have to note there is a traitor in the team and the traitor is a Russian of course. The Russians have never been totally redeemed. And now the Georgian mafia has gone back to Georgia and is manipulating the American-trained president, they are less redeemed than ever, though of course the means are scarce in the USA with the new financial crisis and its bailout to find money to support any kind of military adventure or caper anywhere in the world, not even Tibet, not Even Georgia, certainly not Ukraine, especially since the European president proposed in New York at the United Nations General Assembly to re-open negotiations with the Russians at a higher level than those that were frozen because of the Georgian American-trained and American-armed imbroglio. It is true that the tunnel from the Russian Federation to Georgia, dug out some 15 years ago or so became very handy indeed. So this film enabled us in 1997 to see the Irish IRA, the Basque ETA, the American FBI, the Russian SRV (or FSB) and a few others I guess save the day, cut short the plan to kill the First Lady, and finally got rid of this American Jackal. Unluckily things changed later for the worse and luckily we can hope things are going to change again and this time for the better. When the Americans discover after the financial crisis and its bailout what proportion of the banking system of the USA has been bought up directly or indirectly by the Chinese, the Russians, the Europeans, the various oil funds from the Middle East or from Northern Europe, or whatever, then they might finally realize they have to work with the rest of the world against plain criminals, or criminal terrorists if you want, and not send troops everywhere and imprecations against anyone. It is just the film we need to start understanding the world has really changed but the West in general and the USA in particular have NOT followed that change and have embarked on a revival of the old days. That started eight years ago and the \\"formerly\\"-CIA financed Ben Laden had enough know-how and connections to invest his own plans into some maneuvers that smelled like good old cold war tactics and manipulations. The actors are great, the suspense is quite well organized though of course we can know what is going to happen always a couple of second ahead of time. That's good for our egos, and we all have at least three egos according to Jacques Lacan, the Ego, the Superego and the Id.

0930289234|1.0|I bought Watchmen based mainly on reviews and the super-hype I read about. It starts off pretty good i must admit, setting the scene nicely for an interseting read. But all to quiclky it becomes self involved, with little interest in entertaining the reader. It essentially waffles! I cared little for the characters, so why would I care about their histories/psyches? Art is very good considering when it was written.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|At the time of this album's 1971 release, Carole King had long since proven herself one of America's greatest pop songwriters, but she had yet to be fully recognized as a performer. It wasn't for a lack of trying. Early in her career she'd released a few singles from her perch at the legendary Brill Building, including the minor hit \\"It Might As Well Rain Until September.\\" She'd also produced a smattering of titles for the [[ASIN:B00000339M Dimension]] and Tomorrow labels in the mid-60s, an album with the group [[ASIN:B00000J2PL The City]] in 1969, and her solo debut, [[ASIN:B0012GN0M6 Writer]], in 1970. The latter held many charms, but found King singing her way past rock `n' roll backings or fitting herself into country rock. Writer's variety is broader than the piano-centered productions of Tapestry, but neither the upbeat numbers nor the placid ballads of King's debut proved the expressive jazz-tinged singer-songwriter vehicles of this sophomore breakthrough.<br /><br />Presciently, Writer's closing cover of \\"Up on the Roof\\" did point the way to Tapestry, taking what had been a signature 1962 performance by The Drifters and rearranging its Latin beat and swirling strings into an introspective piano ballad. It's the same magic King performed in transforming the searching adolescence of the Shirelles' \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" into the thoughtful worry-wonder of a woman on the brink of thirty. The feats are all the more impressive for the lyrics having been written when King was barely twenty-years-old herself, writing for commercial acceptance on AM radio rather than pure self expression. Here, as throughout Tapestry, King's piano is the instrumental focus, allowing her to emote through her voice and fingers in parallel.<br /><br />The funky opener, \\"I Feel the Earth Move,\\" finds King's vocals equally at home up-tempo. Her emancipated expression is breathtaking, and a bluesy piano solo enhances the euphoric freedom. Such openly emotional writing would be cloying in less talented hands, but King was not only an expert wordsmith, but a definitive interpreter of her own material. Her gospel-tinged version of \\"You've Got a Friend\\" is heavier than James Taylor's contemporaneous single, amplifying both the pain and relief of the song's lyrics, and the closing take of \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\" is stripped of Aretha Franklin's arrangement and supported instead by King's piano playing and an overdubbed backing vocal. The spare instrumentation brings this closer to a songwriter's demo, but King's performance finds a dedication to the lyrics that reclaims her stake in the song.<br /><br />In addition to re-imagined versions of earlier songs, King composed intimate new works of relationships being strained (\\"So Far Way\\") and broken (\\"It's Too Late\\"), loneliness (\\"Home Again\\"), salvation (\\"Way Over Yonder\\") and faithfulness (\\"Where You Lead\\"). It's only with \\"Smackwater Jack\\" and the album's title track that King took to more fictional abandon. The sum total of Tapestry swept the 1971 Grammys, netting King awards for Album of the and Pop Vocal Performance, as well as Record of the Year ( \\"It's Too Late\\") and Song of the Year (\\"You've Got a Friend\\"). The album launched \\"It's Too Late\\" to the top of the charts, and followed with \\"So Far Away\\" as a top twenty. Both singles' B-sides, \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" and \\"Smackwater Jack,\\" got their share of airplay, with the album peaking at #1 at the start of a six-year stay on the charts.<br /><br />Legacy's two-CD reissue features the original album on disc one, and a second disc of live takes recorded at various locations in 1973 and 1976. The eleven tracks of disc two repeat the Tapestry song list, save \\"Where You Lead,\\" whose lyrics King had deemed servile, and left off her set list. Over the years, this material was performed in a variety of musical settings, but Legacy has selected arrangements featuring only voice and piano. There's not much distance between Lou Adler's lean arrangements for the original album and these solo takes, but removing the intermediation of studio recording pushes King even closer to her songs. She adds an occasional inflection to her melodies, but what really sets these performances apart is the communication with her audience. The songs are transformed from interior expressions of a songwriter to vehicles for sharing emotions and responses.<br /><br />King really digs into her songs on stage, bringing the sleeper \\"Beautiful\\" fully to life and adding extra passion to \\"Way Over Yonder.\\" As on the original album her \\"covers\\" of songs made into hits by others reveal new emotional layers. \\"You've Got a Friend\\" spurs King to vocal exclamation, and \\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\\" is sung with a declarative force that's in startling contrast to its intimate lyric. Even more so than on the studio versions you get a hear King's singing and playing as natural expressions. Running the live tracks in the same order as the album suggests just how carefully the album was sequenced; but what isn't shown here is how these songs fit into King's larger live set. It's also interesting to note that none of these tracks were selected from tours that promoted Tapestry itself; they're all from subsequent album tours.<br /><br />Those who purchased earlier versions of Tapestry will enjoy the new light shed by the live tracks; they can be purchased individually from on-line download services. Those picking up their first Tapestry CD may also want to reach back to the 1999 reissue for the bonus track \\"Out in the Cold,\\" likewise available as a download. This latter track is reputed to be a Tapestry outtake, though its provenance remains disputed. Legacy's deluxe gatefold digipack includes new liner notes by Harvey Kubernick, period photos from the recording sessions, and song-by-song lyrics and instrumental credits. This is a superb reintroduction of one of the 1970s most endearing and enduring albums.

B0008ENICU|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  You have to remember that it was filmed in 1939 and considering \\"women\\" were not big stars..men were the draw for the time.  There is not a man in site. You don't even hear a male voice...I was amazed that it could be pulled off.  great movie!
B000SXOI66|4.0|Dark Side was a great album. But it was not that great. I love the songs, Time, Us and Them, Eclipse, Breath in the Air, and the instramental On the Run. But the song Money? That song was one of the most annoying pieces of garbage I have ever heard. The great gig in the sky is not much better, just some 'soulful wailing'. A good album, but overated.
B00005JPS8|5.0|So, for one reason or another I got this item in the mail today. woot woot.
B000SXBOP4|5.0|Ziggy is simply fantastic. It is a brilliant album.    1: Five Years-The opener is one of the best songs on the album, I love how easy this song is to sing along to    2: Soul Love-Another great song about diferrent types of love.    3: Moonage Daydream- Honestly, I hate this song. Its good, just when I first listened to this song, it was on a youtube video from a live concert in 1973. That version was six mintues long, with a face melting solo by Ronson. ( You can still see the video, type search on youtube for Moonage Daydream, HAMMERSMITH 73)    4.Starman- The albums single, very good song    5.It aint easy- Really loud!    6.Lady Stardust- Nice piano work, great vocals    7-Star-Really fast, One of the weaker tracks    8-Hang on to yourself- Weak as well    9- Ziggy Stardust-Best track on the album, one of Rock's first power ballads, fantastic song.    10-Suffragate City-Rockiest Song on the album, modeled after White light White Heat by the velvets.    11-Rock and Roll Suicide- Short track, but really good. I love the part when Bowie starts shouting, like \\"Heroes\\"
B000002JSJ|5.0|In Through The Out Door and Coda were abberations. ITTOD was JPJ's album and I guess that under the circumstances he did the best he could. Coda was an outtakes album which is not bad but not a legacy type of album. Presence on the other hand is Zeppelin at their hardest and tightest, an awesome album bracketed by two of the greatest tracks they ever laid down - Achilles Last Stand and Tea For One. I first heard ALS when Presence was first released and thought it was the greatest thing Zeppelin had ever produced. I still think it's one of their top 5 tracks but on a par with it, for me, is Tea For One. I bracket it with In My Time Of Dying as two of the greatest blues tracks ever made. JP's playing on this track is blistering. God knows how many guitar tracks he laid down but it sounds like 3 or 4 separate guitar tracks and each compliments all the others wonderfully. Having listened to the remastered CD I can finally appreciate just what a phenomenal job Bonzo does on this album in fact, for me, Bonzo's drumming is what really makes this album special. Listening to it on a dodgy cassette player all those years ago I couldn't appreciate what a job he did but if ITTOD and Coda showed didn't really give Bonzo a chance to shine, Presence does in spades. Percy might have recorded all his vocals in a wheelchair but you could swear he was wearing and tearing his stuff when he recorded this, Plant had his voice back and this album is a testament to that. JPJ does a great job of supporting JP and Bonzo without ever dominating and James Patrick Page just peels the paint off the wall with a masterclass in rock and blues guitar. It's a shame that many can't hear beyond Achilles Last Stand on this album but I really think that years ahead, this album will be regarded as the classic it truly is. If JP, JPJ, J(Jason)B and Percy ever do create new music, I hope to hell it sounds like this - tight but loose.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This band confounds many people, but I really dig them.  I have this album and The Soft Bulletin, and they are both pop masterpieces.  This band gets compared to Pink Floyd quite a bit, but that's misleading.  Lyrically, they can't touch Floyd, and musicially, they're not the same.  However, The Flaming Lips are, I guess for lack of a better term, a space pop band, like ABBA with an almost Floydian vibe.  Some of the melodies on this album are positively gorgeous, and the layered, thick production is a deep, poetic pop symphony.  I especially love Fight Test, one of the Lips' best songs ever, the title track (both parts), and the really beautiful In the Morning of the Magicians (great title).  Sometimes the lyrics are a bit obvious and kind of silly, but I believe these guys are sincere, and the melodies are so beautiful and beguiling you can drown out the sometimes subpar lyrics.  This is a good album for those interested in getting into The Flaming Lips.
B000WDQOLY|5.0|This is by far my favorite episode.  I have watched it so many times and laugh at it every time.  I highly recommend it to anyone training for or has run a marathon.
0061537934|5.0|Boy, this is one of those stories you just didn't want to end.  What a delightful story as told by Enzo the Dog.  Emotional, compassionate, funny, suspenseful, this one has it all.  I had not heard of the Author \\"Garth Stein\\" prior to reading \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\", but when I finish this review, I am going to do a search on Amazon and buy his other books.  It was a great read from first page to last, and I am serious--Garth if you are out there--do a sequel about Enzo's life as a man--please?  I bet he would be just a great guy!
0385736002|2.0|The ideas behind the story for this book are interesting, unfortunately, the writing is not. I found the characters flat and one dimensional. I honestly found it difficult to care what, if anything, happened to them. I also found the writing style repetitive and overly dramatic. The book just couldn't keep my attention.. and with a story based on magic, elder races, immortal men and a fight for humanity.. it should have.    Such a shame.
0345495004|1.0|This is a tiresome story about selfish, self-important people for whom I felt nothing but contempt. The best part of the book was the end. The book itself deserves the same ending.    I would have rated Loving Frank zero stars, but the form wouldn't allow it.
031606792X|5.0|This book was awesome I'm just so sad it's over, but it was riveting every second that it lasted... if u love the Twilight Series or awesome vampire mythical fiction novels then you'll love this continuation of Bella and Edward's continuing saga... if u don't like it you're crazy or jealous of all the chicks now a days crazy for Edward Cullens lol!!!
0800177363|5.0|Yes, I saw this movie after it was released on VHS back in 1991.  This movie wasn't one of Robin Williams' usual fare since comedy films are more his norm.  But in this film, he performed well.  This film was also different for its other actor, Robert DeNiro.  Action films and Tough Guy films were more his norm.  But in this film, he played a brain-disorder patient and played him very well.  I once read a chapter in a text book and the events in this film are pretty accurately described in that text book chapter although the film leaves out a couple of fact.  The disease suffered by the patients in this film is called Encephalitus Lethargica.  And the name of the drug that was used to treat them was called L-dopa, but the text book calls it Levodopa.  Of course now if you were to look up encephalitus lethargica on webmd, you'd get only articles about Parkinson's.  But all in all, this was a good film.  I would only give it 4 and a half stars, but since half stars cannot be given here, I'm foerced to give it a full 5.
1591841992|5.0|As a graphic designer by training, i was skeptical about the value this book would bring to my table. I picked it up on a whim in barnes and noble. I learned a lot of really useful tips though for quickly identifying and expressing problem and solution spaces. I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Poor execution and a weak script destroy what could have been a memorable adventure.  This was the worst in the series and does not belong on the shelf next to the other 3 films.
B00005JA2B|3.0|Leftoverture starts off with a pure classic but then seems somewhat lacking for the next few tracks only picking up toward the end with the promise of things yet to come.  Not as consistent as the real breakthrough down here in Oz - Point of Know Return - but still a must for any Kansas fan's library.  Anyway by today's standards it's a breath of much needed fresh air for us old 70s rockers decaying away in middle age.  And yes the remastering is very good!!!

B00009NHC5|5.0|While there are many excellent reviews for \\"Wait Until Dark,\\" now that I own the DVD, I feel compelled to reiterate for others my deep appreciation and \\"thrill\\" for this absolutely wonderful film.<br /><br />As a teenager I was never a fan of Audrey Hepburn--until I saw \\"Wait Until Dark!\\"  Like many teenagers of the time, one of my favorite genres was \\"horror/thriller\\" movies like \\"Psycho\\" (1960), \\"The Birds\\" (1963), \\"Comedy of Terror\\" (1964), and \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" (1968).  While \\"Jaws\\" (1975), \\"Alien\\" (1979), \\"The Shining\\" (1980), and \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" (1991) would follow as audience favorites, for my money \\"Wait Until Dark\\" is the zenith of this genre.  While I can remember other films, I will never forget \\"Wait Until Dark.\\"  It is literally  the only film that I have ever \\"jumped\\" in surprise while watching it.  I will never forget the \\"darkness\\" of the theater, the tension of the crowd, the sounds and screams, the audience on the edge of their seats--many ducking down or closing their eyes in fear--and the shear excitement of the experience of \\"waiting\\" and watching \\"Wait Until Dark.\\"<br /><br />While watching \\"Wait Until Dark\\" on a television set is nothing like experiencing it at the theater, making the room as dark as possible and using headphones can make a close approximation.  I have sworn for 41 years that I would never watch \\"Wait Until Dark\\" again because I thought I could only truly experience it one time; but when the DVD went on sale I could not resist the temptation--and I am glad I did.  I was totally wrong.  It still thrills me, even though I know what is going to happen.  The only complaints I have are that the DVD \\"extras\\" are lacking, and the old cardboard storage box is a disgrace.<br /><br />\\"Wait Until Dark,\\" for those who don't know, was originally a Broadway production, directed by Arthur Penn, which opened on February 2, 1966.  Warner Brothers-Seven Arts purchased the rights shortly after, and quickly brought the production to the \\"big screen.\\"  The script was adapted by Robert Howard-Carrington and Terence Young directed the film. Warner Brothers assembled an incredible cast that included outstanding performances by Audrey Hepburn, Richard Crenna, Alan Arkin, and Jack Weston.  Most theaters went along with the productions intriguing concept: \\"In an effort to duplicate the suspense on screen, movie theaters dimmed their lights to their legal limits, then turned off one by one until each light on-screen was shattered, resulting in the theater being plunged into complete darkness.\\"  And it worked like a charm!<br /><br />Of interest to me, from the \\"extras\\" was learning that a Broadway revival directed by Leonard Foglia, which opened on April 5, 1998 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, amassed a nearly equally amazing cast that included Marisa Tomei, Quentin Tarantino, and Stephen Lang in the lead roles.  I have never really been one for stage productions, but this certainly would have been once I would have liked to have seen.<br /><br />If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.

0385733577|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this book other than magic and adventure.  On the first page I was hooked.  For me a book has to start good and stay good all the way through, this did that.  I immediatley loved Josh and Sophie and their closeness thoughout this book his heartwarming.  I can't say I've loved Nicholas Flamel, he's a very strong character (hence it's his story) but he's not the one I found myself wanting to follow.  Scatty is great, the perfect warrior.  Dee is the perfect bad guy, he's cunning, sly, and very bad.  I loved how this book took our modern age, mixed it with magic and mythology.  A true page turner that does leave you hanging.  After finishing this book you will have to read the next book.  I myself cannot wait to read the next installment.  Truly a book I'll keep on my bookshelf to be read again, the adventure is that good, for adults and children.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|I really found this movie quite the antithesis of \\"charming.\\" Now, admittedly, Hepburn and Peppard were two very attractive, physically appealing people. However, I couldn't stand their characters. Let's see -- she makes her living by leading rich men on, taking their money and then dumping them at the last minute. He's a \\"kept man\\", sleeping with a married woman. Why should I like these people?    Furthermore, while people seem to find Holly's dialogue cute, I found Hepburn's performance flighty and really annoying.  Her attempt at a Southern accent during her big scene with Buddy Ebsen is quite laughable.    There's a high pitched, gossipy tone to a lot of the film's dialogue (particulaly, during the party scene) that drives me up the wall. I get the sense that Capote was indeed writing from his personal experience, but why should anyone care about these people's amoral, superficial lives? The development of the romance between the two leads is pretty unrealistic (the shoplifting scene is especially lovely! How romantic!), and Holly's big epiphany at the end of the film is not the least bit believable.    Much has been said about Mickey Rooney's potrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. Even given allowances that Americans were less sensitive about racial depictions 50 years ago, it's impossible to watch Rooney's antics here through 21st century eyes without feeling totally appalled and embarassed. (By the way, Mr. Rooney, I don't need to be \\"forgiven\\" for hating your performance). It's enough in  and of itself to toss the movie into the historical trash bin.  This just adds some extra sour frosting to this stale cake of a film.     Even if Rooney's scenes were edited out, you'd still end up with a ridiculous movie that would barely past muster as a TV movie on the Lifetime Channel. To any men out there: your significant other will owe you BIG TIME if she makes you sit through this.
B0017ASV1C|1.0|Unfortunately, this eagerly anticipated, much hyped about team-up between screen legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro proved to be nothing more than a tiresome, disappointing, and ultimately embarrassing exercise in straight-to-DVD schlock cinema. If anything, John Avnet's \\"Righteous Kill\\" showed us just how tired and worn out these two faded stars have become. The film was not able to emulate the electric chemistry the two actors shared 13 years ago in Mann's earlier film Heat (1995), which was so provocative and so moving that the sheer magnanimity of that famous 'coffee shop' scene heralded more than just a dream come true for movie fans; it was a love affair between two of the world's greatest living actors. In \\"Righteous Kill\\" on the other hand, we have a paunchy, tired looking De Niro and a gaunt, gravelly-voiced Pacino reduced to playing TV parodies of themselves with about as much chemistry as a mongoose paired with a rattlesnake.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Have you ever bought an album because you really like the song and than you play it and the song you like sounds nothing like the rest of the album.  That is how I feel about the Foo Fighters.  I buy the album for a single and find that the album rocks a little harder than my tastes.<br />Skin and Bones plays like a best of for songs you will have heard on the radio.  It is a good solid album and every song is familar.  Based on buying this album I bought tickets to see the FF live at the Joint, I can only hope the show is as good as this album.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|One of the things that made/make the Die Hard series so great is that they are GREAT action movies...and this one is an excellent example! I love it when McClane tells the bad guy that his girlfriend is down the elevator shaft with an SUV up her ... It is pure Die Hard dialog! This is a keeper and I am glad I bought the unrated version on DVD so that I could have the famous Yippee Ki Yay line that we all know and love so well. But I must say one of my favorite lines in this movie is when Justin Long is amazed after the helicopter crash and in a dazed voice he tells McClane 'you kill the helicopter with a car' and of course McClane acts like it was nothing but a normal Tuesday for him.    IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO DIE HARDS THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR COLLECTION!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|WOW!!!  What a cd.  Most cover CDs struggle for the artist to bring their own style to the music.  This is not the case with Mr. Cash, each song is sung as though he owns it.  It gives me chills to listen to his interpertation of some great songs.  This is truly a work of art and I just wish there was a volume two to look forward to.
031606792X|5.0|I loved the entire Twilight series.  Breaking Dawn, was definitely not a disappointment.  I loved how the author leaves you guessing the fate of Edward and Bella until the final chapter.  I really love it because it also leaves room for a 5th book (if the author chooses).  I think the story intertwines nicely with the other books. And you realize that there are clues that foreshadow what will happen in the future.  Very nicely done. I am just so upset, I dont think there is a better series that could top this!!!
630469654X|5.0|For anyone who's looking for a film that you can watch with your family, and friends for some slight humor, an easy to follow story line, a villan versus the good guy, LadyHawke is the way to go. With some of today's top people in the leading roles you quickly get into the story. It's sad though that so many people are saying that music and the directing is so bad because it itsn't. So please remember as you sit down with your popcorn that this spectacular film is an older film. So get ready to enjoy something that I hope will get to be a family favorite.
031606792X|3.0|I have waited a long while before posting a review of Breaking Dawn.  I'll begin by saying that I neither loved nor hated this book, which is rather sad for me to admit. I truly enjoyed Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  I began reading the series in 2005 with the release of Twilight and I have anticipated the release of each installment since.  I stood in line at midnight to procure my copy of BD and rushed home to read it cover to cover.  When I was finished, I was speechless, which if you know me, is not like me, at all.  I was in a state of shock.  I had so many high hopes for this last installment and while I was greatful for the happy ending, I hated the way the events transpired.  I loved Edward, and I enjoyed his sarcastic and cynical comments and sadly they were completely absent in BD.  Bella just blew my mind.  I really have no words.  And then there is Jacob.  Before BD's release, I couldn't imagine ever liking him, and somehow, he became this most alive character in the book.  The fact that I can even say that is terrible.    All in all, I was glad that Edward and Bella got their happily ever after, but put out by the events that lead to it.
031606792X|5.0|I love all of these books.  Breaking Dawn does not finish it for me.  Ms. Meyer introduces a brand new character in the last 5 pages, that sets up a love tri-angle (again).  Are we to never know the out come?  Many story lines are hinted at, towards the end.    I am just not satisfied that everything is wrapped up completely.

B000BCE918|4.0|I won't bother rating the movies since they've already been reviewed by trillions of people here.    Be aware that Amazon doesn't seem to be selling this collection as a \\"fold-out\\" version of the \\"Adventure Pack\\" packaging (not anymore, anyway): The 3 pics of the original collection and packaging posted at the top of the page are from a customer, not Amazon.    The package consists of:   1) A printed hard paper DVD case sleeve that looks identical to the \\"foldout\\" container pictured, except that it obviously doesn't have \\"fold out\\" doors.    2) Inside the sleeve is a DVD holder that looks identical to the one in the customer pics.    3) The printed art on the DVDs is different for each disc, unlike the customer pics which show them as printed specifically for the Adventure Pack (black with a red Jurassic Park logo). It's as though the discs were taken from individual retail packaging and placed in this set. Bummer. However, the disc menus appear to be made using the same theme or template (you'll see what I mean), so who knows? Each disc is 8GB dual-layer, and each contains many extras like \\"Making of...\\" and more.    It would be nice to have gotten the fold-out version of the set, but in all it's certainly worth the $14 I paid for it. I'm sure if you don't have the expectation of getting the original packaging, you'll be happy with this set as well.

0375826726|5.0|I know that some people were turned off by this book, and I agree that it was not as easy to get through as the others. However, I think the story is dynamic and I enjoy watching it evolve through each of the books. A lot of people I know felt the same way when the 3rd and 4th Harry Potter books came out and look what's become of that!    Like others I don't want to give too much away, other than the fire meaning of Brisingr has great significance for the book. I think those that liked Inheritance will will also like Brisingr.    Oh, I almost forgot! I ordered two books with Brisingr (already read all 3!) that I saw mentioned in one of the reviews, The [[ASIN:0743273265 Emotional Intelligence Quick Book]] and [[ASIN:1416562346 The Impulse Factor: Why Some of Us Play It Safe and Others Risk It All]]. They are awesome if you like psychology books :)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|\\"Advertising is about...happiness.\\" So declares Don Draper (Jon Hamm) to a client in one early scene of Mad Men, the richest and most complex program on television right now, at least in terms of its portrait of a specific period in American history.     Since so many of the great reviews here provide detail about the setting and basic premise of Mad Men, I won't repeat. I will simply say that no current TV show deals either directly or obliquely with so many interesting ideas and concepts as does Mad Men. Ostensibly about the New York-based ad industry in its early go-go days near the dawn of the TV age, Mad Men is really about a host of things, including:    The male-female dynamic in the pre-women's movement workplace, and its debilitating effects on women.    The rampant and causal repression of blacks, gays and women and the sense of entitlement among professional white males of the era that the world was their oyster.    The growth of a post-war generation of newly affluent Americans and how the ad industry played on their wants and desires to create artifical demand for unnecessary products, and in the process helped create a culture of consumerism, materialism and envy that is having ramifications even today (witness the mortgage crisis).     The early warning signs of the coming fractures in society that would explode only a few years down the road in the late 1960s.    Bottom line, Mad Men beautifully illustrates the irony of Draper's comment. Advertising, it argues, creates unhappiness - by convincing us that we always need to smell better, look better, and own better things, that nothing we currently have is as good as what we could have, whether that means our refrigerator, our car or our spouse.     But I hope I haven't given the impression that the show is a downer. Far from it. Mad Men is also a treat for the eyes in terms of how it captures the styles and artifacts of 1960 America - from the burled wood and frosted glass of the ad agency offices tothe omnipresent ashtrays to the sleek Hart, Schaffner & Marx suits. The dialogue is sharp, the performances terrific (especially Elizabeth Moss as naive and ambitious Peggy Olson, Christina Hendricks as the secretary of every man's dreams, and John Slattery as roguish Sterling-Cooper partner Roger Sterling) and the production design impeccable.     Buy this now and catch up as quickly as you can. Season 2 is well underway and is equally compelling.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Since the FireFly series is one of the greatest TV shows to grace the Tube, this is going to be amazing on Blu-Ray. With all the same features as the DVD set, and some more commentaries, since Jewel Staite was called to see if she would like to do another commentary for this release of the show, going to be even better. Can't wait, oh and if you've never seen FireFly, go ahead and stop reading this, pre-order it, and then go any buy it on DVD (Super cheap anyway) and once your done watching it on DVD, you'll be ready to re-watch again on Blu-Ray... Gonna be a mighty fine shindig!<br /><br />*Here's to hoping that big sales of the Blu-Ray release will help make another movie or... even better... start plans to bring the show back...*
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I was a teen when ABBA first broke in the 70s and enjoyed a few of their tunes though I was, for the most part, indifferent.  Oddly my appreciation for Benny and Bjorn's deceptively complex arrangements grew over the years and seeing Mamma Mia on stage a few years ago cemented my admiration.  I was skeptical about the movie but, after about the first thirty minutes, I was hooked.  I've seen it five times now, a first for me. :)  Likewise I was skeptical about the soundtrack but, after a few spins, I've again become a fan.  The tunes have been recreated by Benny and Bjorn and many of ABBA's original backing musicians, and the sound in some cases is even richer and fuller than the original tracks. For example, I love the way SOS -- always one of my favourite ABBA tunes -- sounds and Pierce Brosnan's rough-hewn vocals have come to enhance the song for me.     Buyers should be aware this is not an original soundtrack recording: most tracks were recorded specially for the disc in the studio so this would be more honestly labelled, \\"The Mamma Mia cast signs ABBA\\".  Some of the vocal and instrumental flourishes from the movie are missing here, while vocals that do not appear in the film (like the verses from Gimme Gimme Gimme) are recreated here.  The producers made some odd choices, including Name of the Game, which does not appear in the movie, but leaving out Chiquitita and Waterloo.  The beautiful and poignant When All Is Said and Done, which was an inspired addition to the film (it doesn't appear in the stage play) is on the soundtrack but with an added, and needless, new verse. Another odd choice is the inclusion of Thank You for the Music as an uncredited addition to the final track, after 35 seconds of dead air. Nice bonus for those who find it.  But considering that this was a wonderful showcase for Amanda Seyfried's vocal talent and Benny Andersson's piano, I almost avoided buying when I saw it was missing from the album liner. I expect more than a few other buyers did the same.    And for the few who complained about the loss of Knowing Me, Knowing You from the soundtrack of the film, perhaps you missed it as instrumental track early in the movie, then again later in the hilltop chapel.  Considering the song's painful lyric, I thought it was a delightfully cheeky choice as a wedding march. :)
0312330537|2.0|The first third of Shantaram was - despite some lengths - compelling. I developed sympathy for the protagonist and due to severeal hints I expected him to become a better man in the course of all those 1000+ pages. But then, after around 400 pages the story takes a strange turn and develops into some senseless, violence ridden tale. Lin starts to spend his time with characters you could not care less about and puts himself himself deeper and deeper into senseless, violent, dumb and ultimately boring situations. Actually the story's dramatic demise begins with Lin's involvement with the Mafia. I just read on because I could not believe that he would not learn and get out of this crap,  but become more and more detached from his own emotions. Instead of facing his own demons he runs away from them by either taking heroin or putting himself in life threatening situations. One after the other after the other. YAWN. The protagonist develops into an annoying jerk and one seriously starts to question his intelligence. No personal development to the better. None at all. Honestly, the second half of the book is a total waste of time. I wish Roberts had simply written his autobiography.
B00006JKOL|4.0|Do you like Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, and Passion Play?  Buy it, this one has lots of that.    Are you not a fan of the music of Jethro Tull?  Do not buy it, this record will not make you one.    Are you a snarky, music snob with just enough theory under your belt to sound like you know what you are talking about? Go review something that needs reviewing, and quit wasting your time on 35 year old rock albums.    Think I'll go thrash me some Paul Revere and the Raiders.    Good grief.
0451196716|4.0|I read this book 15 years or so ago and just picked it up again to reread.  Seems the first time I was reading, my feet and legs actually started to hurt as the story is written with a lot of conviction.  My feet and legs did not commit to the same agony as before - likely due to them always feeling tired and sore.  All that said, it is a good book and you really find yourself drawn into the Walkers.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|Though not quite as good as their first two albums, Women & Children First, nonetheless, is still a very good album. The album went to #6 on the charts & had one charting single: \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" which peaked at #55. By the release of this album the group Van Halen was a household name & headliners worldwide. Women & Children First was the first Van Halen album to not have any cover versions of other songs.    The album opens with the hit \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" which is probably the second best song on the album. \\"Have you seen junior's grades?\\" Once again Van Halen combines some serious lyrics & yet they have the tongue in cheek. \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\" opens with Alex Van Halen's drums putting down a steady beat. On Van Halen's first album no song cross the four minute mark; on their second album they crossed the four minute mark twice. On Women & Children first they cross the five minute mark twice with \\"Everybody Wants Some!!\\" being the first. This might be some of the reason that the album suffers some; their songs just aren't as concise. I do love the bit in the middle where Diamond Dave throws in a little male fantasy stuff. Next is \\"Fools\\" which is the other song that surpasses five minutes. Some of the problem with this song & the previous one is the somewhat extended openings. In \\"Fools\\", once they get to about 1:30 into the song, then the song improves. By this time you can tell that Van Halen has kicked much of their pop side to the curb. Because of this they're not quite as innovative though I really don't mind that Eddie extends his leads a little bit. \\"Romeo Delight\\" kicks it up a notch but isn't one of the best songs on the album. \\"Tora! Tora!\\" is a short solo instrumental by Eddie which was a staple on most of their albums. This segues into \\"Loss of Control\\" is the shortest song on the album that has lyrics. It borders on thrash. \\"Loss of Control\\" is probably the weakest song they had included on any of their first three albums.\\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" is the best song on the album. It starts off with Eddie playing a mean acoustic guitar & Dave singing. At about 0:45 they kick into the full band & rock out. I love the way Eddie riffs on the song. \\"Could This Be Magic?\\" is filler & has Eddie reveling in some blues with Diamond Dave throwing in his diverse background. \\"In a Simple Rhyme\\" finds Van Halen closing the album in fine fashion adding just a hint of pop to the song. Even Michael Anthony throws in some bass riffs.     With hindsight it's easy to see how this album was leading into the territory they would cover with Fair Warning. I think Van Halen was trying to change it up a little with this album; their first two albums were very similar & Women & Children First certainly breaks away from that. The remastering is excellent (wish Warner Bros. would remaster ALL Van Halen albums!) but, once again, the booklet doesn't offer any information beyond the ordinary.
B001AGHC1I|2.0|Quite boring.  I'm new to Sigur Ros, so I'm not sure what everyone is talking about with the change to their sound and being more stripped down.  This is so stripped down as to be boring.  One of my few album purchase regrets and one where reviewers I normally find reliable got it wrong.  If you're new to Sigur Ros and are wondering what the hype is about, save your money and skip this album.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|My heart wells up when I think of the ridiculously awesome joy Firefly, and then Serenity gave me... years after the phenomenon.  It kills me to see, year after year, absolutely terrible tv shows and movies released and wonder what Whedon and crew could have done with a similar budget.  Tears the heart to know that with each passing year a sequel becomes more difficult to engineer, and less probable.      This DVD captures a lot of what I'm talking about, and I highly recommend it to anyone hoping to support such an incredible thing.    If I ever catch wind of Whedon making a sequel, I will require several new pairs of pants.  And underwear.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|This is a joke.  They are clearly going for a heavy, distorted sound.  But the drums, especially snare, are constantly clipping.  It sounds truly awful, which is a shame, because the music is really very good. A consistently distracting digital distortion, every time the snare drum hits.  I have records from the 1940s that sound better, technically, than this.
B00005MCX3|5.0|\\"Mountain Grill\\" would prove to be the band's highest charting album in the U.S. coming after the now legendary live album \\"Space Ritual\\" that propelled Hawkwind from a cult band into the charts.  The album also features one of the coolest album covers of the 70's in my opinion.  Long before I ever delved into Hawkwind I had seen this album cover in record bins for years and always thought about picking it up just for the cover alone.  Many Hawkwind fans consider this their best studio album and I would agree that it ranks right up there.  The band are in fine form and continue their space rock explorations here.  This album would go on to influence bands like Blue Oyster Cult and even glam bands like Mott The Hoople.  Highlights include \\"The Psychedelic Warlords\\", the live \\"You Better Believe It\\", \\"Hall Of The Mountain Grill\\", and Lemmy's straight forward rocker \\"Lost Johnny\\".   This is a very good Hawkwind album and a great example of top notch space / psyche / stoner rock.
