B0000A0DS7|5.0|The Dutch band Epica, led by Mark Jansen, formerly of After Forever, offers more of what makes After Forever so good...epic, operatic, symphonic, grandiose metal.  While vocalist Simone Simons (who's only 18, by the way) has a beautiful, incredible soprano voice, she can't touch After Forever's Floor Jansen in sheer, gorgeous power...but then again, who could?  That being said, &quot;The Phantom Agony&quot; is a CD that just wouldn't get out of my player for about a week-and-a-half after I first bought it.  Not only is the music and the female vocals first-rate, but the subject matter of the songs (the 9/11 tragedy) makes for a highly topical presentation, as well.  If you like After Forever, you'll like Epica, too.
B000002LEM|4.0|A pretty cool album with some weird experimentations on the band's part.....some classics here though with &quot;When it's love&quot; , &quot;Black and Blue&quot; , and Finish What ya Started.&quot;<br />Monsters of Rock tour supporting this album kicked ass!
B00005AWMF|4.0|Normally not my kind of music, but so good that I've bought it twice. I've owned a few of her albums which are all good, but this really is the &quot;Best of Sade&quot;. All the well known songs are on here: &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, &quot;Sweetest Taboo&quot;, and &quot;Paradise&quot;. This also has &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot;, from the &quot;Philidelphia&quot; soundtrack. I think my favorite on here has got to be &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot;. That track is so smooth and sexy. My only complaint is that this couldn't include &quot;By Your Side&quot;, which of course was released later. Overall though, this will take you to the desert island in your head, especially with a cold drink in hand.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This cd is a powerhouse by all measures!  The initial thought when this band was forming was perhaps a question of whether it would work, of course the answers are within the cd!  The music is jammin and well thought and we all know how Chris Cornell knows how to write lyrics....
B000002GVO|1.0|Hotel California is unquestionably the Eagles best album.  Unfortunatley, even the \\"digitally remastered\\" CD of this album is horrible sounding.  What was it remastered on, a Commodore 64?  Until a properly remastered version of the CD \\"Hotel California\\" is made available, your money is better spent on the Eagles' CD \\"Hell Freezes Over\\".  Although it's a live performance, it was digitally recorded and digitally mixed, therefore the sound quality is outstanding.
B000002LPD|5.0|this album kicks ass from front to finish with strong hits and just flat out Van Halen jams!  I feel this is by far Sammy's best effort with Van Halen.
B00005YXZH|5.0|See all the one star reviews? These are the people who would've given Sgt. Pepper's one star when it was released, only to claim 30 years later that they loved it all along. Likewise here; this will be recognised as an absolute classic in the decades to come, something very few albums, even great ones, can really lay claim to. And, of course, everyone will be claiming they 'got it' and loved it all along.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I loved this movie so much as the humour is just great and the scenery is just so beautiful. Since im from Syndey i thought they did the Sydney part very well. I loved how Dory and Marvin become the best of friends and he thinks of her as a friend even though she is a little annoying. This movie is a must to see and a definate must to buy its defiantly a 5-5.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The Adventures of Robing Hood is best Robin Hood movie ever made. Hands down with second place for away.<br />Errol Flynn plays the classic hero in a tail that will leave you saying &quot;Wow.&quot; I first saw this movie when I was three years old and was so excited to see it on DVD.<br />The movie is the classic tail of the hero Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor. Stop Prince Richard and save Maid Marian.<br />They play it to perfection and this is a must own for any DVD collection or Robin Hood fan. You haven't seen Robin Hood if you haven't seen The Adventures of Robin Hood.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia has always been my favorite Walt Disney film, and I was delighted when I found it on DVD.  The DVD release features the original 125 minute form with narrators' introductions between the acts, in a full screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio which is the same as the original film.<br />The style of this film is quite varied, ranging from the traditional Disney animation used in the &quot;Sorceror's Apprentice&quot; to the almost impressionistic artwork used with the Nutcracker suite and the abstract art used with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.  There is beautiful artistry throughout, and Disney clearly took pains to make the visual work appropriate for each selection of music.  In order, the selections are:<br />- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by J. S. Bach:  a symphonic form of this classic work is accompanied with animated abstract artwork.<br />- The Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky:  to this ballet suite, leaves, flowers, and even mushrooms dance, illustrated with ethereal artistry.  Those familiar with the ballet will see that the character of each dance in the suite is captured beautifully.<br />- The Sorceror's Apprentice by Paul Dukas:  this piece of program music is accompanied by an animated version of the story illustrated by the music - with Mickey Mouse as the protagonist who animates ensorcelled brooms, but then is unable to control them.<br />- The Rite Of Spring by Stravinsky:  in a mild departure from the traditional ballet interpretation, the animation uses the music to accompany a trip through prehistoric earth, from the formation of the planet, through the volcanic period, to the development of the dinosaurs.  While the technique is traditional Disney animation, the style is much more realistic - an interesting mix.<br />- Symphony No. 6, Pastorale, by Beethoven:  a movement of this symphony is accompanied by an animated interpretation of fantastic creatures - unicorns, centaurs, and pegasi - along with half a dozen greek gods in their traditional role.  The action reflects the program of the music, including the storm.<br />- Dance of the Hours, Amilcare Ponchielli:  This ballet music is used by some very nontraditional ballerinas - ostriches, hippos, elephants, and crocodiles.  They still dance elegantly, with rather humorous effect.<br />- Night On Bald Mountain, Moussorgsky / Ave Maria, Schubert:  Traditionally, the devil and his worshipers gather on Bald Mountain on Walpurgisnacht - and here, we get an impressive demon and a raft of profane followers.  As the night ends, the Moussorgsky piece segues into the sacred music of the Ave Maria, with a holy procession ending in a beautiful dawn.<br />Perhaps the best summary of this movie is that it's like an animated evening of dance or ballet - some dances abstract, some with story lines - with the added freedom that the use of animation brings.  This timeless classic will appeal to lovers of animation, music, and dance alike.al role.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Mesmerizing!  I love the footage and how it is edited together.  There is even footage, on several songs, of Jimmy Page putting a spell on the audience.  I think the spell still works, because I can not quit watching.  I hope the producers can find more concert footage to create another DVD.  If you want to feel what it was like to see Led, then get this DVD.  You will have no regrets.
B00009MGQL|2.0|Jeff Beck seems to have been trying for something new here, but it feels like he just went in, recorded a bunch of solos, snippets, and raves, and let David Torn and the other producers put the whole mess together. (In fact, he says as much in a recent Guitar Player interview - also says he hates this record more than any other he's ever done...)<br /> Like the 1980s &quot;Flash&quot;, it appears that Beck is attempting to break new ground by using the latest fad formulas and gimmicks (he had Nile Rodgers over-producing back then, Apollo 440 now). It only half succeeds. There are almost no discernible &quot;songs&quot;, with Jeff simply vamping over electronic wallpaper. The achingly beautiful guitar lines Beck is known for are nowhere to be found on this pieced-together sonic patchwork.<br />  I like Jeff Beck a lot - have all his albums back to the Yardbirds, and seen him live four times - but this doesn't do it for me. Beck is still one of the best guitarists on the planet, and had this been any other guitarist's offering, I would likely have called it groundbreaking - but we have come to expect so much more from our Jeff. Maybe next time...

0783225849|5.0|When it comes to modern-dress movie monsters, you can keep your Freddys and Jasons. I'll take the shy young man perched in a gingerbread house on a hill overlooking a failed business venture off the main highway. Yes, it's Mr Bates (wide smile: \\"Norman Bates\\"), leading a life of quiet desperation, perhaps with a deranged parent. \\"But she's harmless! She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds!\\" Norman has a hobby: he stuffs things. In Robert Bloch's 1959 novel \\"Psycho\\" Norman is an overweight, middle-aged whiner. In Joseph Stefano's 1960 screenplay, stunningly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Norman is a handsome 20-ish recluse who offers sandwiches and milk to the woman arrivng at his motel late one rainy night. Mr Bloch introduced Mary Crane in Chapter II and had her dispatched in Chapter III. In the movie version Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the central character through the story's first half. With her biological clock ticking away, Marion finds herself in an impasse with a divorc named Sam (John Gavin), who has financial problems and cannot offer her marriage. Entrusted with $40,000.00 in cash (she's a realty secretary), Marion cannot resist the temptation; and embezzling the money, she drives  out of Phoenix, heading for California and her lover. Her encounters with a patrolman (Mort Mills) and a used-car salesman (John Anderson), both of them suspicious, generate cumulative tension and incipient terror. Part of this is due to Janet Leigh's excellent performance, her fear, her confusion skillfully presented. The fact that she creates such a sympathetic character makes Marion's predicament (and her ultimate fate) all the more compelling. Marion is basically an honest woman and, boy, can you tell when she's lying. (Basically honest, yes, but notice her sister's odd reaction when Sam says \\"I can't believe it -- can you?\\") The picture's best scene takes place between Norman and Marion in Norman's back parlour. Their conversation is at first distantly polite, but soon it becomes more personal; and when Marion makes the mistake of suggesting that Norman's mother should be put \\"some place\\", the mood abruptly darkens. Bernard Herrmann's spooky strings enter the sound track and Norman, his shyness erased, sits forward, his face hard, his voice sharp and dangerous. The story's second half is concerned with Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) who, searching for Marion, comes to Sam's small home town, she herself followed by an insurance detective (played by the strong character actor Martin Balsam). The second half is not as logical as the first half. Why does Sam deliberately antagonize Norman, thus endangering Lila, who has sneaked up to the house to find the \\"sick old woman\\"?   The acting throughout is superlative, though Simon Oakland's last-scene psychiatrist is not aging well. The most difficult role, of course, is Norman; and Anthony Perkins, turning his adolescent charm inside out, balances the character's awkwardness with a sly, cynical understanding. It's a terrific performance, in both senses of the word, and many people were surprised and upset when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. (Hitchcock and Janet Leigh were both nominated.) Unfortunately, we have Anthony Perkins partly to blame for the \\"Psycho\\" sequels of the 1980's, each one becoming increasingly garish and silly. As for Gus Van Sant's 1998 \\"replication\\", it's to be avoided like ... well, like the Bates Motel.
B000059TCE|5.0|The saga of 101 spotted pups abducted by a omnivorous fashion maven after their pelts.  In classic Disney fashion, exquisite animation, infectious music, endearing characters, and a gory storyline are melded into a truly hypnotic tale.  This movie operates on a deep personal level for me as arch-villainess Cruella De Vil is almost certainly based upon my ex-wife.  Not only is her lust for the epidermi of adorable animals eerily familiar, but the physical resemblance between the two is striking - particularly since my ex started going gray in the mid-1980's.  My four-year-old twins (from a second marriage, their genes therefore untainted by Cruella's doppelganger) arrived at this conclusion with absolutely no prompting from me.  The first time De Vil flounced onto the screen they both squealed \\"Daddy look - it's Auntie Sheatan!\\" (i.e. the name I encourage them to call her, Sheatan being Arabic for the man with the horns and the cape).  Whatever your own personal experiences with De Vil or her look-alikes, you and your children will delight in this vengeful tale of her deserved comeuppance.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|...is my review of this CD in very short form.  Now, to elaborate, as I am an avid fan of both APC and Tool, I bought this CD knowing I was going to love it before I ever listened to it...and so I did.  This is an amazing album.  It is a bit different from &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;.  I think it's generally mellower and prettier than the first, with the exception of the almost Tool-esque &quot;Pet&quot;.  Maynard is, of course, in fine form throughout, as usual.  I really liked the APC version of &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;.  I think it should be mentioned here that &quot;Nurse&quot; is not an original song.  It is a remake of a song by the now-defunct band Failure, from their 1994(?) CD &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; (which is a very good CD in its own right).  On Failure's CD, that was one of my least favorite songs, but APC's version makes me smile. Even though it's rather pathetic song about a crazy guy who thinks his nurse is in love with him, the swell of the strings gives kind of a warm-fuzzy feeling.  My other favorite tracks are &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, and &quot;Gravity&quot;.  Now I am eagerly awaiting the concert here in Houston on November 1....
0395502322|5.0|I ordered this book used from fivedollarbooks (aka Candlewood), and returned when I saw it was a paperback. Condition was satisfactory, but I wanted hardcover specifically. The seller gave me a full refund, even refunded all shipping. After a month, Amazon still has not corrected the description above. Check with the seller to be sure you are getting the edition you want.<br />There is a hardcover version available from Amazon, but it does not include Mythopoeia. <br />Regarding the content, wow! &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; alone is priceless. Like Niggle's leaf is to a forest, so this story is to Tolkien's larger works: smaller, but not lesser.
B00004XONN|5.0|MTV introduced me to Radiohead's pre-KID A stuff (i.e. \\"Creep,\\" \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" \\"Paranoid Android,\\" etc). And while I enjoyed those songs, I never really felt the urge to buy the albums from which those songs came (of course, this was around the time that I was a hardcore fan of Hip-Hop, and owned not a single rock album... but of course, this didn't stop me from listening to rock music, privately, secretly, guiltily). I wouldn't buy a Radiohead album until they released Kid A, their follow-up to OK Computer. The reason I bought this release instead of their previous ones??? I don't know. But I bought their latest album because of a very recommendable review by David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine (actually, I was swayed by the 4-star rating; I didn't really read everything he wrote). Little did I know that Kid A was a fat deviation from anything the group had previously done.<br />Kid A isn't experimental rock like Sonic Youth's music is. It's atmospheric space-techno-rock for a generation too progressive to fallback on Pink Floyd. It is Bjork for men who love guitars. It's hypnotic, headphone music for reflective insomniacs, people who ponder endlessly about the type of music aliens must listen to; or the kind we will hear in the future (in a greater world, \\"National Anthem\\" would actually become our song to the world). It is Radiohead's White Light/White Heat: brief, experimental, and as a result, inspiring a saliva-dripping hunger for more. And this is what I admired about it. Kid A is as alternative as the independent and foreign movies that I love. As a sophomore in high school, I never really tried to fit in with the popular crowd. I embraced what I loved and didn't care what anyone else thought. If anything, I actually felt (and still feel) cooler indulging in what other people ignored or were blind to. This was the first album to make me feel cooler than I actually was (and probably ever will be).
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I've never written a review before mostly because I have never felt the need, but the is CD is something completely different.  Gavin's lyrics are meaningful, and have a unique sound.  All the songs are good, and I never find myself having to skip over some songs like most cds.  One of my favorite songs on the CD is &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot; which the theme song for the show &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, which is basically why I bought the CD in the first place.  If you're into this genre you'll love this CD from beginning until end.  I'm not sure if you're supposed to make up words for a review, but this CD is so fantasic and fabulous that the only word fit to describe it would be fantabulous!!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This film is really really boring and only has one thing good about it! That being the 14 min car chase, and that's it! Bad...
B00004XMV6|1.0|I expected to be pretty turned on after watching this movie, but I was apalled. This movie played on every male-female stereotype. Women are weak minded, men are sex-obsessed, not to mention rape and subordination of women are glamorized and glossed over in an acceptably sick and Hollywood kind of way.  Next time I'll just cut to the chase and rent a quality porno instead of subjecting myself to that kind of [stuff].
0385504209|2.0|I have never written an Amazon review before, but felt compelled to chime in here. This book had such an obvious agenda that it triggered my radar immediately. There are numerous inherent contradictions in the theory here. The most obvious being that if, as Brown suggests, the whole &quot;Jesus as divine&quot; theory is a creation of the Catholic Church via Constantine (I'm not even going to touch the historical problems with this), Mary Magdalene would not then be a &quot;Holy&quot; grail at all. Add to it his suggestion that we should &quot;return to the days of the goddess,&quot; as if theat would bring peace to the world. Does this man know his Greek and Roman mythology and history at all? As an example, Athena was the goddess of WAR. Read a little Homer, buddy.<br />There are numerous other problems with this book, not the least of which is the transparent ending, which is obvious from at least midway through, which leaves you with 200 pages of boredom. Admittedly the art history is mildly interesting, but the faulty logic makes this book too annoying to be worth it. If you just can't help yourself, borrow it from your library.
B000002B7U|3.0|Which is much better than previous Jake E. Lee collaboration, \\"Bark at the Moon.\\"  That album was just dead.  Now, for whatever reason, 1986 brings us a slightly better (if much harder to find) album.  Not as good as 3 stars, not as bad as 2.<br />The rock and roll here, though still not comparable to the Randy Rhoads releases, has some feel - \\"Bark at the Moon\\" was just numb.  Except for the good final track \\"Shot in the Dark,\\" the other eight songs are of about the same quality.  Fortunately, they are just good enough to be distinguishable from one another, and Ozzy helps the situation with good lyrics that are very characteristic of him.  At times he tries a little too much to get the notes on pitch, but that's pretty much the norm for him.  Yes, Ozzy does about the best he can do with the uninspired playing of Jake E. Lee.  If anything, this album gets much of its being - for better or worse - from said guitarist.<br />Synopsis of Mr. E. Lee: The good thing is that he never tries to emulate Randy, as he would not be able to anyway.  So, it's granted that he's got some interesting shoes to try to re-wear.<BR>The flipside of that is that he just has no individual style.  He's a run of the mill player who hints at classical stylings on the beginning of \\"Killer of Giants\\" but never really takes it anywhere.  His soloing is a little better than BATM, for example on the all around decent title track opener.  I get the rare detection of feel in his mid-song noodling.  It all breaks back to even again, though, on the inexcusable watering down of the \\"Crazy Train\\" riff on \\"Lightning Strikes.\\" To his credit, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear more rip-offs in his playing, but the previously mentioned one is big and obvious.  A big blunder.  He's not a bad guitar player, but it is ultimately his performances that inhibit the album from producing any solid classics such as the year's cornerstone, Jovi's \\"Slippery When Wet.\\"  Often times, albums get the opposite recognition from what they deserve, but the era of 1986 yielded mostly proper results - after all, glam was peaking, and it would have to be pretty good to still be respected today.<br />Which leaves us with \\"Shot in the Dark\\", the only song Ozzy ever represents this album with, if anything at all.  I admit this song's style is very non-Ozzy like, it's a little light for him, and I don't blame him for not performing it all the time.  Still, that song has grown on me, and somehow, I really think it's a good song - even Jake's high note-bends that characteristically start it off are - tasteful!  It's perhaps a very dated and 80's sounding song, but the groove is strong. I always enjoy hearing this song now, even if it's not the best.<br />Just another good album that's nowhere near great.  The best thing about it is this is the one they decided to package in the awesome green color!... THEN come the songs.  It's being hard to find adds to the mystique.  Collectors definitely find it, and casual Ozzy fans - it's a tossup.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I've had the privilege of seeing Gavin DeGraw live, and what you hear on the album is what you hear live.  He is that good.  <BR>I'll try to forgive the somewhat cheezy video made for &quot;Follow Through,&quot;  because the song is wonderful.  This guy can sing and play the piano with such abandon.<br />Although, the first two songs may be the commercial hits, you need to hear the whole album to understand that when Gavin DeGraw croons &quot;Give Me your Strength,&quot; he's giving it his all.<br />&quot;Chemical Party&quot; is fun and cleverly written.   &quot;Crush&quot; takes you back to every single crush you've ever had. &quot;More than That&quot;<BR>is one of my favorites, because of the soulful intro. &quot;Nice to Meet You Anyway,&quot; is great because I love the meaning behind the song.  I could go on, but I recommend that you buy this album yourself.  If you are disappointed, I would be interested in knowing why.
B00004WIBW|5.0|Tim Burton, being the genius that he is, has, in this delightfully sickening and humorous story, taken three of the best genres and crammed them into one. <BR>Firstly, the fascinatingly revolting gore and graphic decapitating along with the sheer chill of the remote village of Sleepy Hollow and its stories of witchcraft and murder concoct quite the perfect atmosphere for the story to flourish fully.<BR>Secondly, thanks to Johnny Depp and his catalogue of hilarious yet sinister facial expressions, we have a film which not only makes us shudder, but laugh in the midst of the darkness. He plays hapless Constable Ichabod Crane, with an air so realistic, so camp and so... utterly unbelievable that it almost beggars belief. He stumbles his way through the film with likeable cluelessness, loveable eccentricity and a wave of sparkling intellect that sometimes make time when he is offscreen simply waiting time.<BR>The third is of course, the fairy tale. Just when you think you're about to get your teeth into a great slice of gory mystery, it is snatched from you in the most bizarre ways possible. On first watch, Sleepy Hollow is difficult to define and consequently not necessarily as enjoyable to watch as it is the second time. But when you can appreciate it for a fairy tale, a dark comedy and a horror film, you will be drawn to it with an indefinable fascination.<BR>Unbeatable atmosphere with a cast who are all on top form (including a blonde Christina Ricci), Sleepy Hollow should not be missed by any Tim Burton fan. Or, for that matter, any person, alive or dead. Hehe.<br />'The picketty witch... the picketty witch... who's got a kiss for the picketty witch?'
B000089RVR|3.0|Dido's eponomyous debut No Angel took a while before it set the charts on fire and everyone started hailing her as a trip-hop chanteuse. But while No ANgel was largely enjoyable, it had much to thank for due to Thank You and Here With Me. The rest of the album sounded pretty similar.<br /><br />Come 2003, she's back with Life For Rent. First single, White Flag follows in the vein of Here With Me. The single sets the direction for the CD. Dido takes no risk on Life For Rent but rehashes the successful formula that made her a star in the first place. White Flag is enjoyable by most standards, better than most radio fodder out there these days. A good beat, a catchy chorus and haunting vocals - all the right ingredients for a Dido smash. But elsewhere on the album, the true gems are the title track and the near-closer See The Sun.<br /><br /> If you like No Angel Part 2, grab this album. If not, replay No ANgel.
B0000931OG|5.0|This album by far exceeds all albums I have listened to and or purchased this year. This cd is by far worth every cent. I have yet to get even remotely tired of listening to it. It really pushes Blur's dimensions. One would think that the loss of a great guitarrist would damage their career severely, but blur's heart still beats. Like crazy. so.  The album broadens its horizons musically. It takes world refrences and sounds. Some tracks, like the first two, have a French lounge singer's quality, in an extremely good way. Crazy beat definitely has that american pop jam song quality to it, and is the same blood type as 'song no. 2' from the self titled album. There are spanish guitar influences in some of the songs. There are dance sounds. There are punk sounds. There are jazz sounds. There are R&amp;B/Soul sounds. Admittedly, there are Gorillaz sounds in there, and many have criticized Blur for this. I belive this has been a very wise move. It has added just a hint of a new dimension to their sound. Lyrically Blur has always been substantial. They maintain this quota in Think Tank.  i give this album five stars, and would give more, due to its inginuity, creativity and all around awesomeness. Blur really kicks.

I alternated between singing and crying throughout the whole thing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When i initially listened to my friend's copy of OK Computer back in 97 i was pretty unimpressed.  Wierd, trancey, pseudo-rock that didn't appeal to me.  I enjoyed the singles off Pablo honey and the Bends but OKC didn't appeal.  3 years and a lot of life later i came back to radiohead, having found this album in a bin at a used cd store and picked it up on a whim.  I listened all the way through.  Then again.  Then again.  And i got it.  and I Loved it.    Thom's amazing voice weaving through the music, the eerie calm and almost innocence of the music, the thoroughly disturbing Fitter, Happier.  And the way it all wove together themes about modern life and failing culture and civilization.  As well as the theme, i found, of artificial happiness (summed up by the title of the album)  This is truly a rare gem of music that should stand beside the greats of musical history as a landmark and a monument.  Radiohead stands proudly beside the Beatles, Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, Elvis Costello, Pink Floyd, and all the others as giants among us mere mortals.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Yes, they are a Joy Division cover band.  But joy divison were so much more exciting than the art rock coming out of brooklyn these days.  Hurray for joy divison and hurray for the band that covers them!
B000069CWE|2.0|Well, I'm a Linkin Park fan, so I figured I'd be in for a treat when I heard this album... But then I listened to it. Somehow these guest artists manage to take Linkin' Park's best songs, knock the lot of 'em down a few notches in the tempo department, and take out everything that made the music interesting. Essentially, it's Linkin' Park's best work, made dull.

0812550706|5.0|I first read Ender's Game the summer of my 7th grade year.  I was forced by my parents to pick 3 books to read.  I stumbled across this book, and it seemed decent enough.  I was in for a pleasant surprise.<br />Every single paragraph in this book is a masterpiece.  The dialogue, and even more importantly, the plot, is simply excellent.  I cannot express my appreciation to Card for writing this book.  I have spent countless hours reading Card's other books, both in the Ender series, and ones not in the Ender series.<br />The plot is so well developed that you will not be able to put the book down, and I truly mean that.  It might be wise to choose a 3 day period where you will be able to read this cover to cover.  I know I got it at like 5 PM one day and read until the sun rose the next morning and I had finished.  It is that good.  If there is one book that you read this year, please choose to read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card.
B00005JLSE|2.0|I really have given this movie 2 1/2 stars, but what does it matter?  As I heard the results from the Academy Awards, that Chicago had received 6 awards, I simply knew that it would be the best movie of the year.  So, I rented it with great expectations of a movie with emotional actors, glorious dance and singing scenes, beautiful cinematography, and all done with a witty humorous dialogue in a well written, original, breathtaking movie with noteworthy moral value.  <br />I was expecting something spectacular.  Instead I viewed a movie that was rushed, unmoving, lame, with standard acting, standard singing and dancing, standard acting, all performing to a song we've all hear before.  It is your same old typical movie.  <br />Actually, the music was less than standard, with actors that can't sing, or dance, repeating the bad lyrics over and over again created by an obviously talentless insipid lyricist.  I at least expected it to be a visionary marvelous beauty, but in turn it had dull red colors, an old 70's movie atmosphere, with a limited array of dismal colors and didn't sparkle as I had expected. <br />Musicals usually aren't suppose to be dramatic, but this movie intentionally accomplished this, but when the actually music in the musical is bad, what is left to the movie?  In my opinion this movie was boring, and I actually fell asleep on it, actually, and missed nothing.  The actors didn't have chemistry together, nor did the director concentrate on interaction between the women of the prision.  Characters are introduced, and fade as they preform to the horrible ranting music.  <br />It wasn't very fun, due to the fact that the characters were mindless bimbo female murderers and an arrogant cheating lead actor lawyer that causes a rotten woman to run free, and star in a musical afterwards.  I know this was suppose to just be a fun movie, but it wasn't because the acting and music was so bad.  In this case the movie `Glitter' should have received as much raves.It simply is not that good.  Now I know that the Academy Awards aren't an accurate rating system.  Between this overated movie, and the overated album of Norah Jones, I don't know what Awards show to believe anymore.
B00005JL96|5.0|My two year old, husband, and I all love &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch.&quot;  My daughter loved Stitch, the music, and the colorful images.  My husband and I loved the humor and message of the movie.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch.&quot;  It's a great Disney movie and one the whole family will love.
B000002H6C|5.0|In my view this is metallica's last great album and without a doubt worth owning.This album is full of fury and great songwriting.Alot of critics complain that the songs are too long,but that is a petty complaint when you really think about it.I dont mind listening to long songs as long as they are good.The lyrics are intelligent and thought provoking,not like the silly nonsense of load or st anger.Metallica was once about the passion for music,but now they are about money and lars ulrich acting like a jackass with an over inflated ego.GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY!!!
0789723107|5.0|This book is fantastic and needs to be read by anyone in your company that has anything to do with page design, layout, site direction, etc.<br />It's short (180 pages), it's funny (he teaches &quot;Advanced Common Sense&quot;), is clear and concise.  There's no excuse for not putting this one on your reading list.<br />Especially helpful were the examples of what TO do, what NOT to do and, importantly, how the author would fix the &quot;NOT to do&quot; examples.  It ends with a few chapters on usability testing and includes a good script for do-it-yourself testing.
B000002H97|4.0|This is metallica's last good cd which is worth owning.The black album is more melodic and different from previous albums,but it's still a good album.It's an album which can definetly grow on you and make you appreciate how the bands sound was refined on this album.In my view there really are no filler songs on the album,but some definetly stand out more than others.All later albums are just plain horrible and not worth buying in my opinion.GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam is one the greatest rock bands in the world, but since their third-album there's been a decline in the passion behind it. Don't misunderstand, these guys have some great riffs and even clever lyrics, but that driving passion behind the first three albums has been more sporadic than consistent. Riot Act changes that. This CD has a very direct message about Vedders views on the US policy has enforced by the current administration (that king and queen in ashes you see on the cover, represents Americans) the music is also full of symbolic references. From the haunting &quot;I Am Mine&quot; to the techno inspired &quot;You Are&quot;, this CD is amazing, it captures the essence of Pearl Jam, rekindles the passion of Eddie Vedder and showcases the talent of all band members.
B000059XUO|5.0|I thought that the movie was great.  it was interesting and i loved it.  Brandon Lee was awesome and he made the movie what it is. If you like any CROW things,  you will love this movie.  i recommend this movie to anyone. It was a touching movie and so are all the other CROW movies.
B00004T9UH|4.0|THIS IS EMINEM'S BEST CD SO FAR. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD. ''STAN'' IS THE BEST EMINEM SONG EVER, AND BOY IS THIS ONE UNFORGETTABLE SONG, ESPECIALLY IF YOU SEEN THE VIDEO FOR IT. OUT OF THE WHOLE CD, THE REMIX TO ''B***H PLEASE'' ,WHICH FEATURES SNOOP DOGG, NATE DOGG, XZIBIT, &amp; DR. DRE, IS THE BEST SONG ON THIS WHOLE CD. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS IS THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CLEAN VERSION, THEY ALLOW EM TO SAY A**, B***H, &amp; SH** BUT THEY STILL WON'T LET HIM SAY F**K OR MAKE ANY REFERENCES TO SEX, DRUGS, OR VIOLENCE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A VERY ENTERTAINING CD. TRACK 16 ON THIS EDITED VERSION IS ''THE KIDS'' INSTEAD OF ''KIM''.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Oh my GOSH! I absolutely LOVE RHPS! I've almost completly worn out my VHS and I'm out to get the DVD now. The soundtrack is great too! My friend an I do the Time Warp at school and anywhere else we can have a diskman!
B000099T2L|1.0|I didn't like this CD. The only good song on it was &quot;Crazy in Love!&quot; I don't think I will be buying another one of her cds for a long time.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I think that the Marshal Mathers LP is Eminem's best. His first major album (the Slim Shady LP) was kind of dry and almost a little too immature (I mean that in the way that it is made, not the lyrics, which are good). The Marshal Mathers LP has got great lyrics, good beats, and when you listen to it, you're taken into a new world, which, as messed up and disturbing as it can get, is awesome.<br />Eminem is a truely great rapper, and the Marshal Mathers LP really shows you how tallented he is. The Eminem Show is also really good, but in my personal opinion, not quite there.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Sure Christina lives up to her sexy image, but beyond that is some serious and soulful songwriting.  This disc rocks.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|Finding Nemo is a wonderful computer animated movie about a fish named Nemo that gets lost from his father. The movie's graphics are astonishing-the level of detail is really high and everything looks really good. It's a great movie for both children and adults. The action in this movie surpassed my expectations. <br />The characters in Finding Nemo are all unique and interesting. This movie has a good dose of humor, also. The storyline is well developed and the movie keeps you excited about what will happen next. You have to see this movie if you haven't seen it. If you have I would definitely recommend buying the DVD. There are many cool bonus features and some parts of the movie that you might want to see again.
B00006879E|5.0|This ia a great in-the-car CD.  They tear across a number of musical styels and pull it off with a very listenable album.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The Italian Job is a great action movie with a smart storyline and great acting. I really enjoyed this movie because of its exciting plot, great characters, awesome Mini-Coopers, action, and humor. The story is about a group of thieves who are betrayed by one of their own. After successfully completing a gold heist one of the members of the group hijacks the gold and kills the leader of the group.<br />What ensues is a fast-paced and exciting action movie. I really enjoyed the visuals-especially the speedy and highly manueverable Mini-Coopers. These awesome cars are used for the transportation of the gold in a great car scene through the subways and streets. The Italian Job is a really good movie that you have to see.

0767853636|4.0|Cheesy or not - sometimes parents have to weather through the bad movies for thier childrens' sake. I saw this movie when I was a little girl and thought it was the BEST movie I had ever seen! It took my breath away and now it does the same for my daughter. Bash it all you want, but for little girls, its' a dream come true!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater, where the film benefited well from the wide screen and huge sound of a larger theater.  Naturally I had to have the movie when it came out on video; my children would never have forgiven me otherwise.  The question was whether we should also get the DVD.  Well, we now have the DVD and the answer in retrospect seems to be obvious:  ABSOLUTELY!<br />Our version of the VHS tape included an Elton John video as an extra, which was nice, but the extras in the DVD version are excellent and far more numerous.  As Disney has re-released \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" and now \\"The Lion King,\\" they seem to be getting better and better at value-added extras; more on the extras later.  The principal value is in the movie itself, of course, which benefits from a phenomenal cleanup in both the video and the audio.  As you compare the condition of the film in some of the extra features with the digital version you can readily see the improvement in video quality.  The DVD sound benefits from the greater quantity of information available on the DVD versus tape, and the elimination of hiss and pop is noticeable.  Movies such as these are the main reason that everyone should have a DVD player.<br />The movie itself likely skirts the borderline of its G rating.  There are several very intense and scary scenes, some involving blood.  The murder of Simba's father is particularly intense, and may be frightening to very young members of the audience.  However, I believe that with appropriate parental guidance the movie can be an excellent teaching tool as well as good entertainment.<br />The story broke new ground for Disney, which has typically relied on western European and North American mythology and legend for the majority of their full-length animated features.  This movie incorporates a central theme embodied by the Elton John and Tim Rice song \\"The Circle of Life,\\" which has significant ecological meaning as well as explaining death.  A scary thought for the very young, but the movie introduces the concept that those who have lived before live on, and as long as you remember them, they can never truly be gone, a beautiful and wonderful thought, and but a fraction of the wonderful philosophy lived by the animals in the movie.<br />The story itself is a story of maturing and realizing responsibilities, and telling the truth.  Simba is the future king of the pride, and it will be his responsibility to lead the pride and to guard the pride lands, keeping the balance of all things.  Simba's father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is the wise king trying to teach Simba to always do the right thing.  Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) has always felt that he should be king, and uses Simba to put Mufasa in a position to be killed.  Mufasa then tells Simba that it's all his fault.  Simba runs away in guilt and shame.<br />The next portion of the story shows Simba as he meets new friends and grows up, but has yet to take responsibility for anything.  A female cub Simba knew before he ran away, Nala (Moira Kelly), comes seeking help for the pride, as the pride lands have become desolate.  She finds Simba (as an adult voiced by Matthew Broderick).  At first she is unable to convince Simba that he needs to do anything, but after talking to his father (an excellent scene), Simba realizes that it is his responsibility as Mufasa's son to help the pride.<br />The next portion of the movie involves the confrontation between Scar, his henchmen, the hyenas, and the lionesses and Simba.  The ending has another somewhat frightening moment for the younger members of the audience, but of course we know what the outcome must be.<br />The extras deserve description, because several are among the best I've yet seen on a Disney DVD.  Both Elton John's videos are included for \\"The Circle of Life\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\"  Elton's performance in both videos is nothing less than phenomenal.  There is one place inthe extras where Elton is shown with a full-grown lion.  That image alone was worth viewing the voluminous extras.  There is another section on the African influence to the movie, particularly the contribution of Lebo M.<br />Another section of the extras talk about the animals themselves, and their actual behavior versus their behavior in the movie.  We also see scenes of actual animals to compare to the animated animals.<br />There are a couple of video games, one of which was interesting; the other would perhaps appeal to children.  One was a personality test, to see which of the characters you are most like; enjoyable.  The other was to match sounds with the animal that made them; fair.<br />Another excellent extra was Timon and Pumbaa's virtual safari.  There are two different safaris you can take; one in a jeep, the other in a boat.  Both were funny and good.  In conjunction with the safaris is a trailer for an upcoming Lion King movie called \\"The Lion King 1 1/2.\\"<br />\\"The Lion King\\" movie is filled with so much for a family: the role and importance of a father; doing right; taking responsibility; considering the effect one's actions has on other living things; and so many other things that I am unable to list them all.  The story is well told and animated, and the score is magic.  There are so many reasons to show this movie to the whole family.  In addition is a collection of some of the best extras ever on a Disney DVD.  One of the few movies where I'd like to give the DVD six stars.  A movie that should be in every family collection and for anyone who considers themselves an expert on animated movies.the extras where Elton is shown with a full-grown lion.

0671027344|5.0|i'm not going to write a summery of the book. that would be pointless because this books summery did not mean much to me. i loved this book, but not because of the plot. i loved the main charchter, charlie. i loved the way he thought. how simple he was, how much of a 'wallflower' he really was. this book tied up my insides and made me cry. and smile. and i loved it. and you will too.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I didn't know what to think of this album at first, but then I listened to the entire album while reading the lyrics, and It simply reaches out, grabs you and then you are off on a mystical journey. This piece of art is beyond words, as is all of Maynards work.  This cd talks to you kind of like that voice in your head, not your ego, but that voice of truth, a concious voice, it opens you up to feel vulnerabe, then pulls you in and comforts you. Listening to this CD makes the hair on the back of my neck stand, it is truly an incredible experience every time I listen.
B00005JM02|3.0|I dont know maybe its just me but I have yet to see this thing about albert brooks so far I havent found anything about him I like least of all his voice which unfortunatly is all you hear though the whole movie him whining and screaming and yelling frankly it ruined the movie about the only thing that some what saved the movie for me and I cant belive I am going to say this is ellen she was actually funny he constant babbling and yammering saved my interest in the movie that and the wonderful animation best yet I just wish if they do another movie please dont think of albert brooks dont hire him dont even consider him for anything other then what he might be good at and that would be cleaning up at the gas station the only reason I am even giving this as high rating as I am is the animation and yes I am going to say it again ellen
B00008CLOA|5.0|I've listened to the major acts in music history such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, U2, The Beach Boys, etc. but no other album has left a stronger impression on me than Pink Floyd's astonishing masterpiece &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. This is without doubt the best piece of music I've ever heard.<BR>The Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; might have been the pioneer of the concept album, but Pink Floyd redefined and perfectioned it with this crowning achievement.<br />&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is the definition of a true album because it is more of a long piece than a collection of songs. It is one long glorious symphony that from the first heartbeats of &quot;Speak To Me&quot; to the climatic finale &quot;Eclipse&quot;, it is nothing short of mesmerizing. The songs flow one to another with the most expert cohesiveness and structure, while at the same time it lyrically and sonically goes on the most exhilarating musical journey through the human psyche, exploring the aspects of everyday life such as time, money, division, war, greed, insanity, aging and death and how they mold, shape and what they mean to us as individuals.<br />The album is also magnificently produced. The multilayered, textured sound effects create an involving and rich ambience that immediately sucks you in, and even enhance the themes the album is working with (The ticking clocks in &quot;Time&quot; and the cash registers in &quot;Money&quot; are still innovative by today's standards). Musically, &quot;Dark Side&quot; is as beautiful and breathtaking as it can get. The album's cosmic, surreal sound landscapes and its soothing, hypnotic pace are so delightful that they get planted in your ears and your brain.<br />&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is more than an album, it's an experience. It's a work of art and one of the most important contributions to music in the 20th century. The proof of its impact is out there. 14 consecutive years in the charts and more than 35 million copies sold. It's an album for the senses, the mind, the heart and soul. Simply put, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is the best album ever made.
B000089RVR|5.0|I truly love this CD as well as her first CD No Angel.  It is similar music to her first CD.  I never listen to a CD from start to finish without having at least one song I don't like.  But I like them all.
0385504209|2.0|I read Angels&amp;Demons which I loved. Went out 3 days later to buy this book, and was very disappointed. It was a decent read, but fell short of its potential. It was a good plot, but very underdeveloped. Angels&amp;Demons seemed to flow and the story seemed riveting from page to page. The DaVinci Code had its good points. However there were times when the author seemed to drag the story on. Buy it at discounted price if you want to read it, but it is not worth the full price of a hardcover book.
B00005JKHN|1.0|Everything about this release is wonderful except that it has a manufacture digital flaw. Both our original and replacement had the exact same digital flaw, in the exact same location. Too bad that this dvd was released without getting the bugs out first.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When in despair, pick up a new cd.  And you can bet that anything that &quot;A Perfect Circle&quot; puts out is going to be a winner.  &quot;13th Step&quot; is a masterful work:  a compilation of different tangible emotions comprised into a lovely package.  And you don't have to be a ex-substance abuser user to enjoy the steps either.  Honestly, it is an inspirational album, and a complete breath of fresh air.  The first time I listened to it, I wasn't completely for sure on that there cd, but I tell ya what, give it a couple more whirls and you will be one happy camper.  PS Don't stalk Maynard, just embrace his music...<BR>RJ
1400034779|5.0|This is the most beautifully written book I have ever read.  The language weaves a spell around you and the images described are breathtaking.  I have to admit this isn't my usual type of book.  The hype got to me so I broke down and got it.  Boy, am I glad I did!  <BR>It is such a treat to be swept away into a foreign land and given an insight into the culture and daily lives of its people.  This is a simply written book but it compliments the land, people, and story so well you don't mind.  <br />`The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency' begins with Precious Ramotswe and a modest moment.  It is an afternoon where Mma Ramotswe introduces us to herself and Botswana.   She is enjoying her time at her \\"only female detective agency\\" in Botswana.  The novel travels from the present to the past in such a fluid way; it makes you believe that stories could only be told in this way.  <br />Alexander McCall Smith creates a strong female character that is down-to-earth, while being intellectually and morally evolved.  Precious carries her client's problems as her own.  They instinctively become yours as you feel a part of her life.  She shares with us the beauty and tragedy of her beloved Botswana.   This country is lucky to have someone who loves it so much.  As we are introduced to the people in her life, don't be surprised if you end up feeling sorry of those don't take her advice.  Her logic defies comprehension and you find yourself agreeing with it without question.<br />It is a treat to find a character that you wouldn't mind being like.  Mma Ramotswe is worthy of imitation.  For a story that will tug at your heart and having you cheer Prescious' clever ways, I highly recommend this book.
B0000666DW|5.0|Ah Mastodon. Mastodons music is a sweet blending of influences and caters largely to the open minded music fan; this is because they dont have a true enough genre affiliation, its also because they dont seem to be asking anyone for help on what to do. I personaly love it when a band tosses aside all convention and persues an avenue unconsidered and it surely seems to be that Mastodon are filling a gap and bringing together enlightening resources.<br />In Mastodons music you can hear great influences. A very deffinate shade of Neurosis enters here along with Isis. Those two bands alone are so awesome that putting them together is a no miss afair. Although Neurosis and Isis are two personal favorites of mine that I know to well, Mastodon go even further and shed thier own substance on the musical Gumbo they make and add thier own spices. First off thier drummer is a psychopath and unleashes torrents of off time rolls and burns through the music like a lazer through butter. Second the guitarists play solos! I love guitar solos and have missed them from anything in too much metal for the last 10 years. Third these guys have the most raw and honestly heavy crunch I've heard in a long time. Fourth and yes! These guys have some real strength in melody enough to have a whole journey that creates a winning album in its entirety and not a short winded romp with no diversity.<br />Music for healthy hungry carnivores with a soft side too.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Thank you NIckleback for making such an awesome blend of music.  I am very pleased with this CD and it is one of my favorites of the year.  I was starting to fear that Nickleback was going the way of Aerosmith (Bubblegum Pop) but they pulled themselves up out of the &quot;curb&quot; and produced such a kick ass CD.  GO BUY IT NOW!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is one of the best dvds around, not to mention one of the best movies out of the 90's. It's out of stock, but try as hard as you can to get this. Even if it takes an arm and a leg, it will still be worth it to get this wonderful dvd.
B00005JM0B|3.0|This summer was plauged with every bad movie idea Hollywood could pull out of its ass.  Pirates of the Carribean almost made me kill myself for seeing it, and SWAT sure didn't help.  So maybe after seeing those two bombers of films T3 didn't seem all that bad to me.  Some flaws did occur however, one, don't let Arnold speak so much there was a reason he said 10 words total in T1 and T2.  Two, T-101 was infected for like 2 minutes in the film and then he cleaned himself out.  Three they rushed want could have been an awesome 3 hour movie into a less than 2 hour movie, for shame.  Cameron knew you had to have storyline with action to make a good movie, that is how you can tell this wasn't directed by him.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I really love this Band. They put out some supurb music. This album is very good from start to finish. I have had this album for over a year now and I still tend to put it in every week or so. It is one of those cd's you can't really get sick of no matter how many times you listen to it. I have listened to this cd way too many times to count and I still put it in my cd player from time to time. These guys have great musicianship and i'm sure they will be putting albums out for quite some time. Go pick this up, it is one of the best albums of 2003.
B000089RVR|4.0|I love Dido, but I either really like or really dislike her songs. Off No Angel, I loved the tracks 'Here with Me' and 'Take my Hand'. But that was it. I didn't like the rest of the album. With the debut of her sophomore album, I find myself again liking only three of her songs- 'White Flag' 'Life For Rent' and 'See the Sun' which is my favorite. 'Don't Leave Home' is also good. #1, 3, 6, and 11.
B000002J03|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest recordings in rock history and in my opinion the best of Led Zeppilin's non-compilation recordings.  I am not just a rock fan, I love blues, jazz,hip hop, house, and I always feel the best albums transcend their genres and become simply great music which this one does.  This album has a definte blues soul powering the heavy metal blasts of this album which stands out as brilliant compared to all the heavy metal garbage from countless bad imitators over the next three decades.
B00002E224|4.0|First off, I'm a dude and this isn't a movie that only chix will dig. I saw this movie on late night t.v. thinking it was going to be pretentious crap.  I normally like action type movies, but for a movie consisting entirely of dialouge, it managed to hold my attention.  I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, but I will say the ending cuts of the locations where the two main characters, only without them in the scene...was very poignant.  I'm kind of an old dude now, but I wish I had experienced what this young couple had if only for a brief period of time.  They took a risk to get to know each other knowing it was only for one evening and it was not ruined by cheap sex.  This is what relationships should be, these people really cared about each other.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I have to give it at least 3 stars for the performances of Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifa.   As a dancer, I found Rene Zellweger's performance painful to watch.  Overall, it was sort of a disappointment.  A great musical that could have been more entertaining if cast differently.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|To start, I come from a background in philosophy (currently an undergrad) which certainly does bias my view of _The Matrix_ series.  With that said, _The Matrix Reloaded_ was a true masterpiece of philosophical intrigue, not to mention an intricate plot and dialogue.  It is understandable that many do not see this; the majority of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie are hidden in a single sentence, a complete scene, or interlaced throughout the entire movie.  In line with the above, _The Matrix Reloaded_ is not for those who dislike a lack of finality in a movie: by the end it raises more questions (on many different levels) than it answers (apparently in line with the designs of the Wachowski brothers).  For these reasons, claims about a lack of plot is understandable; without seeing the finer aspects (or having interest in the topics) _The Matrix Reloaded_ is more like a shoot-em-up action thriller with expensive pyrotechnics than a psychological and philosophical work.  Thankfully, the world needs both types; if everyone were interested in philosophy the world would be worse for it, in my personal opinion (though I think most, if not all, could definitely use some instruction in general logic and fallacies).<br />Along with the above, I also felt that the sex-scene between Neo and Trinity (though quite tame according to today's common movie standards) was not needed.  Some I have talked to say that it (along with the dancing in Zion) demonstrated the 'culture' in a post-apocalyptic world, but I don't see it (it is probably also related to my own personal aversion to 'hard' music, like what was played during the scene).  Carrie-Anne Moss is beautiful, granted, but I personally would prefer to view her with a little more covering.<br />For those who have not seen _The Matrix Reloaded_, here is a list of the philosophical topics it deals (or continues to deal) with: the nature of reality, the limits of AI, indeterminacy in human action, determinism (interestingly enough, as articulated by a computer program), multiple realities, self-defeating programs (see the most recent trailers for more on this), identity, and multiple worlds (i.e. modal semantics).  Some of the above are subtle in the movie itself, but you can find them (and probably more) if you look.  On a related note, if you haven't seen the philosophy section at The Matrix website, do so (I particularly liked the Dreyfus and Dreyfus paper).<br />In short, I would suggest _The Matrix Reloaded_ for those who don't particularly like to go to movies to stop thinking (or for those who like to do such, but also like the occasional movie that makes you think).  If you focus more on the plot and dialogue (something that most other movies are lacking), you will probably enjoy it more (though the computer graphics are very well-done).  For those who are 'techies' or 'computer guys,' you will probably like it as well.  For the others, more power to you; just avoid the movie (and probably any discussions related to it).
B00006BTCA|2.0|This CD seems to generate pretty extreme views; people either hail it as a work of brilliance or denounce it as a tired retread of the 80s. In fact, I think there is something to both views. There are a handful of very strong songs on this album; I would say the first three songs, and the song &quot;Hands Away&quot; are all pretty interesting. They have something of the majestic remoteness of certain Cure songs (&quot;Plainsong&quot; comes to mind) without really sounding like The Cure. These also happen to be the songs in which the vocals are the least prominent. <br />But when the band gets cranked up with their jangly guitars and that irritating voice, they start to sound like any number of 80's bands, and not the better 80s bands, either. A lot of people have mentioned groups like Joy Division, but I think that is undue flattery; more often, they sound to me like The Fixx, Flock of Seaguls, or Saga (songs like &quot;Stand or Fall&quot; or &quot;I Ran&quot; could be dropped seamlessly into this album). There are also ocasional flashes of groups like Ultravox or the earlier OMD albums. I don't see the comparison with the Psychadelic Furs at all. <br />I have to say, though, that I am surprised at the popularity of this album. Interpol seem to be trying to do the same thing with 80s music that the White Stripes are doing with 70s rock, borrowing from the past rather than innovating and developing their own sound. I can understand why a band would want to do this: it's a lot easier to copy than to produce something fresh. But why are people so eager to buy it? Wouldn't it be better to listen to the originals from which these sounds are derived? It's a mystery to me.

B00005V3Z4|3.0|As it features Echo &amp; The Bunnymen's single The Killing Moon within its first five minutes, and Joy Division's epochal Love Will Tear Us Apart within its last ten, Donnie Darko is the sort of film I have a natural weakness for. It plays like an 80's version of American Beauty. And while it's nicely ironic, well written and cleverly engineered - too cleverly engineered, really - I think it lets itself down badly in execution. An awful lot of signposts the movie needs to make it understandable are down, unclear, or just flat out missing.<br />As a result the film is largely incoherent. Many of the positive reviews praise it for a dark post modernism which I really don't think was intended. There's a fine line between post modernism and incoherence, of course.<br />A case in point: the episode where a jet engine falls out of the sky but which no-one reports as missing. Rather than being a wry satire of corporate responsibility and American victim culture, this is actually intended as plain old daft science fiction: it isn't reported as missing, because it has fallen through a wormhole in the space-time continuum from another universe. You don't discover this until much later in the film. But at least you do find out eventually: there are several aspects which are key to understanding what is going on that you can only discover by watching the director's commentary and having the incidents pointed out:<br />While I was busy soaking up Will Sergeant's jangling guitars in the chorus of the Killing Moon, Frank appears briefly in the first scene of the film, driving past the camera in a red Mustang, having dropped Donnie's sister off after a date. He is also mentioned briefly as having died thirty years ago driving to Donnie's father's school prom. These are important to the exposition (and understanding whether Frank is real, an apparition, or a figment of Donnie's deranged mind) but without the director's commentary you would (on a first viewing) be none the wiser. Similarly underemphasised is the fact that, as Donnie leaves the house on the night of the jet engine incident, he moves into a parallel universe. There is nothing at all in the script that, as far as I could see, gave any hint of that. Nor of the fact that Donnie's pills are only a placebo. The film toys with the question of whether or not Donnie is schizophrenic, but never answers it.<br />In general, Donnie Darko asks a lot more questions than it answers, and by the end of the show I was kicking around a further question: \\"what on earth was that all about?\\"<br />Which I don't think is a good thing.imilarly underemphasised is the fact that, as Donnie leaves the house on the night of the jet engine incident, he moves into a parallel universe.

B0000CABJ1|1.0|one word for this album--REPEAT-<br />why even bother checking out the Donna Summer section in the record stores- Just look at the songs on the listing- every album is the same old song and hasnt changed since the early 80's. Here imaculant voice on the new cd is the same voice on the ones in the 70's- these are just repeat copies of the older cd's. REPEAT-REPEAT-REPEAT- IS THE SUMMER GLAMOUR NOW.

0393057658|4.0|Great writer, lousy title, flawed book, but still worth reading if you know what it's about.<br />Fans of the Oakland A's will enjoy the book for the inside view of the 2002 season - incomplete but insightful where Lewis chooses to look. <br />Fans of baseball who struggle with the direction of the game can see how the economics of the game are driving a new strategy in managing teams - and see why the Red Sox and Blue Jays are following the Athletics formula for appraising player talent differently than traditional (conventional) methods in the league.<br />Those looking for how baseball should be restructured should look elsewhere. This book doesn't have all the answers. It could give fantasy baseball managers a few things to mull over. Sabermetricians will find it light on substance (no math and almost no stats in it).<br />Finally, for fans of Michael Lewis, it's not his best work. I expected more than he fits in here. Good bits, but a bit too much of Michael in the pages, and not enough about the rest of the Athletics players, coaches and executives. It reads like 40-60% of the material Lewis had in mind is missing, however; it introduces the New Baseball Management, and the 2002 A's, but ends just when there should be some sort of payoff.<br />More time with the team, or more time to put something more together could have made this a great book. Deserves 3.5 stars, and could have been more (sort of like the Athletics postseasons recently)
0441003257|5.0|This book was one of the best books that I've read in the past couple of years (which is quite a few).  Great characters who I had a great deal of fun reading about in a very untypical story setting for an angel, a demon, and the anti-christ.  I'm very glad that I took a chance on this one (as it is not of my &quot;usual&quot; genre which is Star Trek novels....any series or cast of characters).  I think this would be a great read for a weekend away relaxing or on vacation.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|You gotta love Erykah Badu. She's an original and she pretty much has been writing the same songs in the same grooves her entire career.  Ah...but What Songs and What a Groove!<br />She's got a delicious voice: all black strap molasses and deep amber honey with just the right amount of Jack.<br />Everything on \\"World Wide Underground\\" sounds like it was recorded at 4 AM after a night of partying, trading stories and reciting poetry...just before everyone decided to call it a night. Listen to \\"Back in the Day\\" or \\"Bump It,\\" you'll see what I mean. But before you do: light some candles, open a bottle of Jack, light a good Cuban stoogie and let the Badu woman put you in a trance of unmitigated good humor and love.
B000002UUX|5.0|i just picked up this album a few days ago.this is my first Megadeth album and i love it.im a huge metallica and slayer fan but had never given megadeth a chance.the guitar work on this album is awesome marty friedman and dave mustaine are real shredders and guitar geniuses.David Ellfson is also a great bass player.all the element come together on Rust in Peace to creat a calssic.I enjoi all the songs especially Holy Wars,Rust in Peace.Tornado of Souls,lucretia and Hanger 18.The vocals on the album could be better(dave mustaine isnt the best vocalist)but it is highly made up for by the excellent muscianship.the album has an instrumental  element that really will blow your mind
B00005JLIU|4.0|Yes, please excuse the cheesy title, but my sisters made me watch this when I was really, really young, and whether its nostalgia or fun music or fun plot points, I love this movie.  You can find synopses anywhere online, so I will endeavor just to give an opinion.  This film was definitely made to show off Julie Andrews.  She has pretty much every single song in the show, and while I would like for the other characters to have more singing opportunity, what we have is terribly fun.  The &quot;Tapioca&quot; is a definite highlight as is &quot;Jazz Baby.&quot;  Everyone will agree that the title song is fantastic, but I think where I may be alone is when I say that my among favorite moments in the show is &quot;Trinkt le Chaim.&quot;  I admit that it has little purpose other than to show off Julie Andrews's voice (if you know of another reason, please tell me)  but the scene is lots of fun nevertheless.<br />The reason I give this DVD a 4-star rating is because there are no special features.  I have grown quite accustomed to special features and frequently use them as a way to prioritize movies that are on my wish list.  My affection for this movie should be pretty evident in that I purchased the film without any of my beloved special features.  The movie alone is definitely worth having.<br />If you like, you can also blame the four stars on the racism.  This movie definitely displays none of the sensitivities that we've grown accustomed to over the years.  Definitely, if you are offended by things like the treatment of Asians in movies that predate political correctness, then you won't like this movie at all.  However, if you can allow yourself to enjoy the film in spite of the Asian treatment, then you should enjoy this film.<br />You should also not expect for philosophical discussions to follow a viewing of this film.  Just a contented sigh and lots of joy for whatever activity you plan after this movie.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay &quot;speaks&quot; to a variety of people.  Anyone who has an ear should take the time to listen to them.  &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is an awesome CD packed with songs that anyone would like.  My favorite is &quot;Clocks&quot; along with several others on that CD and on their other CDs.  Coldplay is just the right mixture of rock and metal.  Their sound is so mellow that there is no way anyone could turn them down.  They have a very distinct voice that no one can mimick.  Give them a try and you will fall madly in love with them, as I did.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I have to admit that this film is a guilty pleasure.  It rests on the shelf amidst my more distinguished DVD titles, but it has no need to feel ashamed; Legally Blonde probably gets more playtime than her neighbors.<br />Simply put, I love this movie.  You can't fault a movie too much for just making you smile.  There are tons of ways in which this movie could be worse, but it comes out to be a really good flick.  No, you shouldn't invite your friends over for wine, cheese and Legally Blonde followed by philosophical discussions.  Unless you want to have philosophical discussions in a really good mood that are wholly unrelated to the movie.<br />Legally Blonde just goes to show how good a formula can be, because this move is in every way another film that follows a formula, but I still can't shake my love for this film, so much so that despite the flaws that I see in the movie, I still give it 5 stars.<br />The most prominent flaw in this movie is the fact that Elle is pretty much morally perfect.  People given to hating the sorority girl persona will also have distaste for Elle, and probably wouldn't agree with me that she's perfect.  But truly, there's not really a character flaw that might cause Elle's downfall.  She has to overcome other people's perceptions and there's no reason she should lose because aside from perkiness, she's got nothing holding her back.  Every other character has flaws coming out the nose.  The writers bank on the audience having the same distaste for Elle's lifestyle that the Harvard students in the movie do, and that's just lazy.  On that note, there's very little to love in anyone who isn't on Elle's side.  If it weren't for Elle's &quot;wining personality&quot; causing Vivian to side with her at the end of the movie, Vivian, like the rest of the characters who have it in for Elle would find herself at the end of the movie just as two dimensional as Enid, the feminist lesbian, or the guy who thinks too much of himself, or Victor Garber's character.<br />However, I do actually come into the movie with the same negative preconceptions about sorority girls that allows me to enjoy the film.<br />Reese Witherspoon carries the movie.  She could probably just skip around in front of the camera while everyone else forms a circle behind her and we would probably be watching an interesting film.  Fortunatley, that's not what we have here.  There's a fantastic supporting cast, what with Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge, Victor Garber, Luke Wilson and Selma Blair to name a few.<br />There are a lot of extras on this DVD, all of which are geared toward the target audience of perky blondes.  If you also stick this movie in the guilty pleasures category, then you will probably not be excited about the extra features.  The commentary is fun, even if we hear a little too much of &quot;Reese is great.&quot; On that note, its fun to hear her responses as she tries to graciously accept the compliments, but you can tell that she thinks one time is enough.<br />The behind the scenes and making of featurettes are okay and worth a watch, but they definitely don't beg to be watched repeatedly.<br />The deleted scenes are fun to watch, though you can tell why they were cut (namely because Vivian is entirely too mean).<br />All in all, this movie probably deserves four stars, but I still think its worth the money that I paid for it.  I like it.  I like it a lot.Garber's character.<br />However, I do actually come into the movie with the same negative preconceptions about sorority girls that allows me to enjoy the film.<br />Reese Witherspoon carries the movie.

It's lovely to see the goofy looks on the kid's faces when the little caterpiller makes his way through cakes, fruites and other goodies.  But what is his purpose in life? He becomes a butterfly.  I think it gives us some hope.

If you have a 5.1 system, this is a required DVD.  If you don't, this is a good reason to go get one.  (Also a good reason to go get a big-screen TV)  Beautifully restored picture combined with Disney's new Enhanced Home Theatre Mix (comparable to DTS!) means you'll be seeing this movie again &quot;for the first time&quot;.  Disney just redefined the term &quot;No-Brainer&quot;.
B00004RFFS|5.0|ive never read the anne rice books on this movie, but i happened to catch the movie on tv the other night and really enjoyed it. im planning on going out to buy the dvd for myself soon. i dont really know why many reviews feel that the plot was drawn out and that the ending was stupid. i personally thought the ending was very clever, and i thought that every moment of the movie before that was also excellent. the movie really made you feel for the characters, know how they were feeling and what they were thinking. you could actually sympathize for them adn even though Louie was constantly feeling sorry for himself, i didnt think that it hindered the movie or was annoying at all. i think it made him stand out more as a character. i recommend this movie to anyone who has a taste for vampires and likes horror movies. also, who can resist brad pitt with long dark hair and fangs? =)<BR>~Vampira
B000002UR7|2.0|This release is a must for a Radiohead admirer but only to complete a collection. The growth of Thom Yorke &amp; company is amazing!<br />In this writer's opinion, Pablo Honey is nothing &quot;special&quot;. There is no new ground broken except Radiohead's debut &amp; it is difficult to see the quality of their future work. Yes the performance is fine but the material offers nothing unique. If I had bought this CD first, I probably would not have purchased another. However, with the breathtaking abilities displayed by each of the subsequent releases beginning with &quot;The Bends&quot;, Radiohead has now achieved greatness! So, go ahead, complete your collection!
6304011431|5.0|When this movie first came out in 1995, the title Powder, threw me a bit. First I thought it was Chic Flick.....But it's not! It has an excellent story-line, and has the quality of those good movies made in the 1940's. This in itself, is a great compliment. The movie is well cast and has a wonderful paranormal twist. With some of the JUNK made today, when you see Powder, it is like 1995 is another time and place.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|There is no doubt that this is still a great movie 20 years after it was first released.  Even though I was too young to watch it when it was first released in theatres, it is one of my favorite movies of all time.  However, I do have one complaint about the DVD and that is the TV version section on the 2nd disc is out of sync with the audio, which is unfortunate since all of the other features are ok.  I've already exchanged the DVD twice but the glitch is still there.  I hope that it's fixed in the near future.
B000001DTM|5.0|This CD was like a post-modern U2, a melding of traditional U2 emotion sent into an catchy, riffy, poppy blender of melodic pop rock at its finest.  The subject matter seemed to become more personal and more relationship based as opposed to message/story telling of the past.  It became a cohesive whole that sounded right together, instead of onesy twoesy hits and rolling thunderous anthems; it was a whole album.<br />Some criticized the lyrical silliness of the album's lyrics or thought it was a let down.  Instead, it's the only U2 CD reviewed at Amazon.com with a 5 star rating for U2 by fans.  I'm not one to break the tradition, because this CD was even better than U2...<br />Matthew Hahn, [...]
B00008O89K|5.0|This score, IMHO, is one the best of the last 1/2 20th century.  Truly epic and egaging, the music tells a story and the movie would have been far less without it.<br />My advice is read the reviews for the Varese Records recording.  It is sadly years out of print, and has 4 more glorious tracks on it.  Used copies are going for nearly $100 if that tells you anything.  Get a copy of it if you can though.  If you can't, do yourself a favor and at least pick up the lesser but still great Milan version.  This is one movie score no music lover should be without.

6305327041|1.0|Pew! Aargh!(accompanied by various retching noises)<br />  This film stank so badly that it was positively flatulent. I initially went to Amazon.com to see if other folk had similarly negative impressions and was amazed to see so many people rating this film so favorably and with such Messianic fervor. To admit that I was both saddened and chagrined. Wondering to myself: \\"Are favorable aesthetic judgements really so easily bought and persuaded?\\" And perhaps more melodramatically:  \\"Is this what American cinema has finally  been reduced to?\\"<br />  Quentin's final filmic vignette, a blatant cannabalization of an Alfred Hitchcock story, basically consists of long and tiresome diatribes by the director/actor. The camera lovingly massages him with a series of static head shots, in the talking head style of a television journalist, while he egomaniacally mugs and indulges himself in the most excruciating and high-schoolian sort of verbal masturbation. (The gentleman obviously has the ego the size of a Macy's Thanksgiving parade balloon.) If it is intended as satire, then it is merely a watery satire of a satire--something that completely loses reflexivity in utter artlessness. Poor acting. Pretentious and viscid dialogue. If you want to see wierdness that is informed by good directing then check out the strange and wonderful films of Baz Luhrman or Pedro Almodovar. Or hey, just watch \\"South Park\\" on television- at least that's relatively funny by comparison.<br />  This film is The Emperor's New Clothes and Quentin Tarantino is most assuredly naked.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Although James Cagney was the original choice, Flynn proved to be the definitive Robin Hood. It is possible but unlikely that a better portrayal of the 12th century folk hero will ever be filmed. The screenplay is based on the works of Sir Walter Scott. The cast is superb. The direction crisp and sure, once Warner Brothers replaced William Keighley with Michael Curtiz. In the latest DVD version, both image and sound are restored to their original clarity. Apparently no expense was spared to give this film production values of the highest possible quality. Although renowned for his indelible portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, Basil Rathbone could just as easily play the villain which he does in this film as Sir Guy of Gisbourne. His climatic sword fight with Flynn allows both to match wits as well as blades as they make their way throughout the castle. This exciting sequence offers probably the best example of the talents of cinematographers Sol Polito and Tony Gaudio. Special credit should also be given to Erich Wolfgang Korngold's rousing musical score. He also composed the scores for two other films directed by Curtiz and starring Flynn, Captain Blood (1935) and The Sea Hawk (1940).<br />Given the rapid development of various digital technologies, we now tend to take special effects in films for granted. Almost anything seems possible. Not so 65 years ago when The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed. Curtiz and his crew had to solve all manner of problems to recreate not only Sherwood Forest but an entire medieval society. What they achieved is stunning. Indeed, forests have played an important role throughout centuries of British literature, from Beowulf to Harry Potter. Being a child when I saw this film for the first time, I was enchanted by the idea of escaping into lush green woods where I could pretty much live the way I wanted to with my friends. Not have a care in the world. I envied Robin Hood and his companions. Many decades later, lush green forests still have for me a special appeal which I really can't adequately explain. Perhaps it all began with this film.<br />I am eager to observe the reactions of my grandchildren to the Two-Disc Special Edition. Of course, they will have little (if any) interest in the truly special features which include a commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer, Warner Night at the Movies (1938) introduced by Leonard Maltin, a new documentary, Welcome to Sherwood (2003), outtakes and the studio's annual year-end blooper reel, a &quot;Robin Hood Through the Ages&quot; featurette, &quot;A Journey to Sherwood Forest&quot; travelog, another documentary Glorious Technicolor (1998), two shorts: &quot;Cavalcade of Archery&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Cruise of the Zaca&quot; (1952), \\"galleries\\" which display  historical art, costume design, concept drawings, cast/crew photos, and publicity, and the audio only of &quot;The Robin Hood Radio Show&quot; and Korngold piano session.<br />However, I expect them to enjoy this film almost as much as their grandfather once did...and still does.ave for me a special appeal which I really can't adequately explain.

B00005JM1F|2.0|Old School is a movie of great potential.  Three adults, played by the capable cast of Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson, have all hit a crossroads in life and circumstances force Luke Wilson's character to move into a house on a college campus.  There is the obligatory wild party and crazy college antics, but Old School seems like a movie without a clue of what it wants to be about.  Is this going to be a movie just about crazy adults who start a college fraternity, or is it going to be about some crazy adults who are trying to find their way in life, and along the way start a fraternity.  Scenes seem spliced together, going from a frat party to a birthday party for Vince Vaughan's kids.  Then the conclusion is incredibly ridiculous.  This movie would have been better if more time had been spent on how Wilson, Vaughan and Ferrell came out winners instead of just showing how their frat beat the dean of the school.
B00003ETOW|1.0|I had high hopes for this film, because I could readily envision George C. Scott as Rochester. But, in the end, I think this is the very worst film version of Jane Eyre that I've ever seen.<br />No attempt is made to make Suzannah York plain (she is called &quot;pretty&quot; several times); the actress does a fair job balancing Jane's passion with her temperance, but she seems to lack any real fire. Sadly, feminist diatribes are sometimes inserted into her dialogue, which reek of the 1970s.<br />As Rochester, George C. Scott has potential, but he's largely hampered by the script. He can be both tender and tortured, fiery and depressed, but somehow the mix just never quite works.<br />The script is just terrible--often corny. Many changes were made to the story line for no apparent reason (other than, perhaps, the screenwriter thought they &quot;knew better&quot; than Charlotte Bronte). Worst of all, the quality of the picture is so bad, I wondered if I'd bought a pirated copy! The Lowood section of the film, in particular, is so dark that I often had a hard time making out facial expressions.<br />I don't know if scenes are missing from the original film, but I can say that the editing is very poor. For example, at one point Jane asks if Grace Poole is the one causing trouble at Thornfield...yet the audience has heard nothing about the character of Grace Poole up to that point.<br />Overall, there is nothing really to recommend this film. It is slow, boring, and disappointing.
B00005JMFR|5.0|That's how I know this is a 5 star movie since none of us have seen it yet.  So instead of reviewing a movie which has not been released yet I decided to review Brian's review on October 4th. <br /> He states, \\"This has nothing to do with the Matrix. You people need to learn how to spell. I read review after review after review and I have not found one that doesn't have a misspelled word. It's a damn shame you people can't spell simple words. Some of you can't even spell Neo. I won't go into what other words I have seen spelled wrong. Seems most of you went to school for twelve years but only graduated the fouth grade. And these are all people from the US...what a waste.\\" <br />First it is true that most people are not perfect spellers.  For instance Brian misspelled 'fourth'.  Of course, that could be a typographical error on his part.  And even though I can find no other misspelled word in his comments, I did detect several blatant corruptions of English grammar.  For instance in his first sentence he neglected to capitalize 'the' as in \\"The Matrix\\" which is the proper name of a movie and should be capitalized.  Damn is a verb and he is using it as an adjective to modify 'shame' which a noun.  The correct phrase should have been 'damned shame'.  His sixth sentence begins with 'Seems' which is a verb.  Where's the subject of that sentence?  And last but not least his last sentence is not even a sentence but two fragments, neither of which is a complete sentence.  Oh and US, I presume, refers to The United States which when abbreviated should be \\"U.S.\\"  Brian is correct that it is a shame that most people cannot spell very well; however, is it not equally shameful that most people cannot write a grammatically correct sentence?
B00007K02F|4.0|If you want to see an awesome Mr. Rochester, this film is a must-see. William Hurt gives a rich and layered performance as Rochester, really digging deep into the character and making us realize what a tortured man he is. His rendition of Rochester is unequaled.<br />On the other hand, Charlotte Gainsbourg has nothing going for her except her looks. (Which is undoubtedly why she was cast; she very much looks the role.) Her Jane is wimpy, simpering, and even a little dumb. In short, she is not the Jane Eyre of the novel.<br />The rest of the cast is quite good, the cinematography is lovely, the costumes great, etc. But for me, Ms. Gainsbourg's performance severely detracts from the film.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is one of the rap artists that stand out above the crowd.  He raps his songs with raw power, and his lyrics are brilliant and clever.  The Eminem Show, his 3rd LP, goes more into his personal life.  He raps about everything: his broken marriage with Kim, his mom, his skin color, his sucess, Dr.Dre, and even politics. <br />The Eminem Show has not softened Eminem up (except maybe Hailey's Song).  He still shows anger and disgust in this album.  My favorite tracks are White America, Cleaning Out My Closet, Sing For The Moment, and Hailey's Song, with the depth in all of those songs.<br />Altogether, a solid album, and congrats to Eminem for another job well done!
B00004WGAI|4.0|Of all the film versions of Jane Eyre, this VHS comes closest to perfection. It's true that it has little in the way of production values--the BBC production rather wanders, then runs, then strolls gently as it weaves it's tale--but, overall, it is not disappointing.<br />As Rochester, Timothy Dalton is perhaps a bit too pretty, and perhaps not quite as sardonic as I'd like him to be, but he is not bad in the role. (He does not compare to William Hurt's brilliant portrayal of the character, however.) He is pleasing, gentle, fiery, and mostly everything I want from a Rochester.<br />Zelah Clarke as Jane is equally pleasing. She perhaps lacks some fire and passion, as well, but overall, her portrayal is not bad at all.<br />To my delight, because this is a long film, most of the wonderful dialogue that Charlotte Bronte included in her novel can be seen here. This gives it an extra star above many versions of Jane Eyre, especially the earlier films.<br />Those who aren't great fans of the novel, or of Victorian novels in general, may prefer a shorter film version. But for those who love the story and are looking for a decent film version, this one may suit you best.
044022165X|5.0|This is my personal favorite novel, though I might be a little prejudice in this opinion since this was my first.  The book is about Rudy Baylor, a desperate-for-a-job lawyer, who stumbles across a case to help a dying boy's family fight against a corrupt insurance company.<br />The story is dramatic and very clever.  Grisham makes this one truly about the courtroom and shows that the little guys can beat the big guys.  An excellent novel that is very interesting.  Like many of Grisham's other novels, this one is a page turner.  Very fun to read.
B0000AMJED|2.0|When I rented Fast and Furious, the Tricked Out version, I saw the Turbo trailer. I thought this movie would involve all that was in it. I would've loved to see what happened right when Vin Diesel left. How does an LA cop make it to Miami? Where does the hot chick fit into all of it? How did Brian manage to get away from the cops over and over again? Why did the guy decide to get a right wheeler car?<br />That would've been enough for me to recommend buying this thing. There are plenty of bikini and fast speed scenes. But other than that, snore snore snore.
0743224345|1.0|This book was truly disappointing.  This was the last book I used in preparing for the GMAT and it was so riddled with errors and poor explanations that it made me want to pull my hair out.  The math problems were easy in the book but the actual problems I saw on the GMAT were much harder (and I'm a freakin' engineer!)  I would recommend the Official GMAT study guide with over 1400 questions and irrefutable explanations (they wrote the test so they should know).  My score was 740 and I think the Official Guide was the most helpful.  I also used the Princeton Review book but it was not nearly as bad as this Kaplan trash.
B000065EXI|5.0|This album is a must if you love smooth voiced Jazz.  Diana's voice captures you and pulls you in to a trance of bliss.  The accompnied music with here piano playing all the more sets the stage for one of the best Jazz Vocal CD's to date.

B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is the ultimate Cure album, ever. Robert Smith recorded this autobiographical-album as if it would be his last. In this intimate trip, the mad genius takes us in his deepest feelings about his life, love, dreams and nightmares and even his own relation with The Cure since Disintegration is also the moment in The Cure history when Laurence Tolhurst - a member of the band who was there from the very beginning, somewhere around 1976 - was kicked out of the band.<br />You will LOVE this terrific bomb of sounds. Everything in this is perfect, from the great production to the magical guitars sounds. You will find that even the drums are awesome, as you'll try to figure how technically, it's extraordinary.<BR>And it's intemporal. Yet, it was recorded at the end of the 80's but even the synthetisers doesn't sound like &quot;synthetisers-for-synthetisers&quot;. Everything here is a question of sound. And it sounds eternal. So you can listen this album forever and ever and ever and ever. Listen to this on drugs, while you're in love, when you're sad, if you're dying, but LISTEN TO THIS !!! You'll undestand that you're not so all alone in the world and that somewhere, some people are listening to this album meanwhile you do so. You'll undestand how everything can be Beautiful, even if everything's dark. This is the greatest soundtrack for a love affair, an intimate room-talking or a strangely somber rainy night. And if you are sensible, you'll sometimes cry.<br />I give this album a 10 on 5.
6305268843|5.0|I have only one question/problem about this video:  Why doesn't Hollywood Pictures do the intelligent thing and release &quot;Firelight&quot; in DVD format?  It seems stupid to me that they only released it in VHS format in 2000!!  I enjoyed the movie and would purchase it if it were available on DVD.
0385495323|4.0|This is the only book on cryptography I have read so I haven't much to compare it to. It was written in a rather light style (maybe too light at certain times) but maintained a steady pace. I was particularly interested in Singh's chapter on modern public key cryptography and the discovery that assymetrical functions could be used as encryption/decryption keys. A good book that's easy to understand throughout.
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown succeeds in entwining historical data and hysterical myths.  If you didn't know there was firm historical evidence for truth in history, you would think this guy was on to something. Sex as an underlying reason for all motivation instead of pure belief. Some will like it no doubt.  Not me.  I want a thriller with twists and turns and plots that make me catch my breath...this one made me grab my stomach..and I'm not even Catholic.
B00009TB5G|2.0|Purists feel Jackson departs from the book. However, if the viewer is a casual fan, does it really matter?  In my opinion, \\"Yes\\".

B0000C7PQK|1.0|Much is being made of how different &quot;Voyageur&quot; is from other Enigma releases, but after a few listens I could hear nothing that sets it apart from the first four, except perhaps that this is easily the WORST cd Enigma has ever put out. Yes, even worse than the uninspired &quot;Screen Behind The Mirror&quot;, where everything began to go wrong for Michael Cretu's concept project. In fact &quot;Voyageur&quot; and &quot;Screen&quot; share many of their fatal flaws, mainly cruddy production, forgettable songs and the euro-trash voice of Olive's Ruth Ann. How she became Cretu's muse over the far superior Sandra is a mystery to me.<br />&quot;Voyageur&quot; goes even further by re-introducing another of Cretu's ill-chosen favourites, Andru Donalds. This hack performer has only one trick up his sleeve, doing a pathetic  Michael Jackson imitation with his thin voice...one wonders why Cretu has invested so much in this singer's career. The duet with Ruth Ann is sheer torture.<br />The second and third Enigma cds showed a growing flair for beautiful melodies and arrangements, none of that can be found here. In fact, cretu goes as far as blatantly ripping-off the chorus of ABCs hit, The Look Of Love, in the laughable &quot;Look of Today&quot;, a song about nothing.<br />There are so many things wrong with this CD, all I can say is, stay away from &quot;Voyageur&quot;.

0930289234|4.0|I saw pictures from the &quot;Watchmen&quot; graphic novel for years but I never bothered to read it. I thought the idea of the story (amoral super heroes) seemed stupid at the time so I avoided it (the novel). I was shocked to discover how good it actually was when I read through it at a Barnes and Noble recently. I think this is one of the best Graphic Novels that I have ever seen and I think it should be made into a movie someday.<br />The &quot;heroes&quot; in the story are more like we would be if we were super heroes. They are very human. They really make you consider what super heroes would be like if they were real.<br />This is worth your time and your money if you like dark gritty super hero tales.
B0000696I1|4.0|I had to laugh at the string of reviews for the vhs version of TMNJ III--clearly some adolescents out there are in a little over their heads when it comes to appreciating the splendid depiction of feudal japan and Elizabethan England that the producers wove into this story.  If I had a bright 10-year old at home who was into martial arts I would want them to see this and hope it might ease them into a mature appreciation of the culture that gave birth to their sport.  This last episode is good clean fare for family viewing and will even teach the young dudes some history--cowabunga!

B000089RVR|5.0|There is a common misperception in music , sophomore albums suck, we think so negitavely of sophomore albums infact that we never give them a chance.   If that is the case you are making a serious mistake here with Life For Rent...  Dido not only puts out a successful sophomore album, she supercedes her previous success with more lyrical depth , more intricate beats and a more raw approach that pays dividends.   White Flag is a beautiful song you all know that, but songs such as Life for rent , Marys in india , and see the sun establish Dido as someone who will not be going any where for a while, this cd is very good, it is yet another good sophomore album,  you should give it , and them ( sophomore albums )  a fair chance.
0783222955|5.0|This extremely well done movie colorfully depicts the Southern America in all its flavors, slow moving life, white trashes, racism and all. The movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of the original story except for the fact that it's centered much more around the lawsuit in which a young afro-american man, Tom Robinson, is falsely accused by of raping Mayella Ewell. Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying the silent but forceful lawyer Atticus Finch, and the children, especially Scout was so natural, can't forget her expression of awe at Atticus picking up the gun and killing a rogue dog.    The movie comes to a dramatic finish when the mysterious Boo Radley saves the lives of Jem and Scout from the heinous attack by Mr. Ewell, Mayella's father. The movie elegantly depicts the social values, mutual respect (and the lack of it between 'whites' and the then 'coloreds'), financial and moral struggles of the South of yesterday.

B0000028UK|5.0|I have to start off by saying that I am completely embarrased at how late I was at discovering Pearl Jam.  They kinda just passed under my radar throughout the 90's, and I am kicking myself for being so naive right now.  The reason I bring it up is that it was a single song on this album that changed my mind, and that is....of course, the incredible &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;.  RVM deserves a 5 star rating in and of itself.  Starting off with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever written, the song kicks into high gear with punky drums, and Eddie's incredible voice.  And its not just his singing, its the lyrics.  A liberating song about finally seeing the light and freeing yourself from an abusive (mentally/physically, it doesn't matter how you see it) relationship, there is something about the power in Eddie's words, as well as the conviction that he sings them with, that can be a complete catharsis.  And after a breakdown in the middle, almost as if the band is catching its breath, the grand finale &quot;saw things so much clearer once you were in my rearviewmirror!!&quot;, all the ingredients for one of the greatest songs of the 90's if not ever.  As you read over the reviews of this album you will see that not too many people disagree with me.<BR>Thats not to overshadow the rest of the album though.  There are a good 6 or 7 other songs here that are radio staples, including &quot;Dissident&quot; (an anthemic song on the level of Springsteens &quot;Born to Run&quot;), and the introspective &quot;Elderly Woman...&quot;  It was almost as if PJ wanted to prove that Ten was no fluke, and the emotion and creativity just got out of hand (in a good way of course).  Hopefully you will take my advice and give this a shot, because this is the album that woke me up to how great this band is, and it should for you too.
079213690X|4.0|William Wallace returns to Scotland to find his country without a king and being run by the English.  He finds his own home burned and his father murdered.  This inspires him to try to reunite his country and take it back from the English.  He aligns himself with the leading family being led by Robert the Bruce.  He finds that they are more concerned about their own best future than that of the country.  Wallace goes on to unite his own army and lead them against the English.  Gibson plays this part as if he really was Wallace and his supporting cast is equally magnificent.  The violence in the movie is very graphic but never overpowering.  The scenery and the way it is depicted in the movie are beautiful.  This is classic movie about a person giving every thing for what they believe in and deserves to be watched repeatedly.
B000084T18|1.0|Was it because he was shot nine times? Was it because of Eminem(who I also hate)? Whatever it was, it seems he has become famous and now people all over the country are letting this crap take control of their lives. I mean, I hate ALL RAP MUSIC and this is as worse as it gets. There's absolutely no talent to be seen here(rappers don't have talent!). In Da Club is pure crap! Somebody needs to shove a corkscrew in his mouth because his voice is annoying and they should smash the device that's making that sound in the background while they're at it. You want real talent? Pick up ANY Iron Maiden CD(Iron Maiden has been around for a long time and they're still better than the crap that's being played on MTV and the radio these days) or Opeth. Stay away from anything that has the name 50 Cent on it!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I've been holding off on reviewing this for a while, because I wanted to soak it in, get a feel for it, make sure I didn't miss anything.  And I'm glad I did.  The first couple of times I listened to this, it didn't really grab me.  There were a couple of songs that stood out, but for the most part, I found it to be a bit boring.  Some songs just didn't seem to have that special something that the Maiden classics of yore had.  But I listened to it more.  And then I realized...<br />This album is just fantastic.  No, really.  Expanding upon the more elaborate arrangements of &quot;Brave New World&quot;, adding in a bit of the harder feel of the oldschool stuff, and throwing a few surprises our way, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; proves to be a very strong release.  It's one of their most diverse and musically ambitious albums to date.  Why didn't it register with me before?  Well, I really have no idea.  I suppose the album is one you've just got to become acquainted with.  You're not going to just pop it in, and form an opinion right away.  It's gotta sink in a bit, and sink in it did.<br />The great songs abound.  &quot;Rainmaker&quot; and &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; are fast-paced and melodic, with the kind of vigor that the band hasn't exhibited in years.  &quot;Montsegur&quot; has a killer riff, and a performance from Bruce that proves he's still got it.  &quot;New Frontier&quot; has a sort of &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; feel, with a great chorus.  There are also a wealth of great epics here, such as &quot;No More Lies&quot;, &quot;Pashendale&quot;, &quot;Face in the Sand&quot;, and the title track.  Some of these songs were the ones that took a few listens to get into, but when they finally hit me, they hit hard.  My favorite from the album is probably &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;. Featuring a brutal staccato riff on the verses, and an overwhelmingly catchy melodic chorus, this is one of their best songs to date.  The politically oriented lyrics are also a bit of a departure from their usual lyrical arsenal.  The album ends on a great note with the acoustic &quot;Journeyman&quot;.<br />This album as a whole is difficult to describe, because there's just so much cool stuff going on.  The guitar work is excellent (as usual), and there's even the occasional string section here and there to enhance the killer melodies.  This is the first time the band has used actual strings (until now, they were done on a keyboard), and they really work well.  I would actually like to see them go into an even more symphonic direction on subsequent releases.  Might not get the best reaction from the purists, but I think it'd be great.<br />If there's one thing I can complain about here, it's that the production is a bit weak.  While it does give the album a rawer, more oldschool feel (as opposed to the more slick and lush arrangements of BNW), it also leaves some of the music a bit pushed back in the mix.  Nicko really doesn't stand out like he should.  On BNW, he was brought much further up into the mix, and it was easier to focus on what he was doing, but you've really gotta strain a bit more to make out the intricacies of his drumming.  Steve's bass doesn't stand out quite as much either (although, admittedly, his basslines have been better).  I'm hoping that maybe they'll remix this album some day, but I kinda doubt it.<br />Anyway, despite taking some time to appreciate, this is a great new release from the kings of metal.  Not many bands that have been around for 20 years or more are still making music this good, so it's a real relief to still have Maiden in the business.  I caught them on their last tour, and it was possibly the best show I've ever seen.  The youthful exuberance that these guys display in their mid to late 40's is just amazing.  I have the feeling these guys still have a few good years ahead of them.<br />I highly recommend this to all of the fans.  It may take a few spins, but it's worth the effort.a departure from their usual lyrical arsenal.

On BNW, he was brought much further up into the mix, and it was easier to focus on what he was doing, but you've really gotta strain a bit more to make out the intricacies of his drumming.  Steve's bass doesn't stand out quite as much either (although, admittedly, his basslines have been better).  I'm hoping that maybe they'll remix this album some day, but I kinda doubt it.  <br />Anyway, despite taking some time to appreciate, this is a great new release from the kings of metal.  Not many bands that have been around for 20 years or more are still making music this good, so it's a real relief to still have Maiden in the business.  I caught them on their last tour, and it was possibly the best show I've ever seen.  The youthful exuberance that these guys display in their mid to late 40's is just amazing.  I have the feeling these guys still have a few good years ahead of them.<br />I highly recommend this to all of the fans.  It may take a few spins, but it's worth the effort.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Some reviewers have complained that this is esentially the Gladiator soundtrack on the high seas, and I would have to agree. However, in my opinion, the soundtrack was Gladiator's only good point. In fact, it was far too good for that overrated dog of a movie. In the case of Pirates, however, I felt that the music enhanced what was already a very entertaining movie. The tension created by the very powerful music was amazing. And let's not forget, Hans Zimmer &quot;borrowed&quot; rather liberally from Gustav Holst (listen to &quot;The Planets&quot;) to create his masterpiece for Gladiator. I ran out and bought this CD the day I saw the movie (sorry Amazon, I couldn't wait!) and then went to see the movie again. This score is probably too similar to other works to be nominated for the Best Score Oscar, but I doubt that any of the upcoming movies (except The Return of the King, of course) will have scores this powerful and entertaining, not to mention appropriate.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Normally this style of music gets annoying to me after a few minutes.  However, I found that I could listen to song after song and I really enjoyed them.  Even the songs that are not completely in English I was digging because they had upbeat, cool sounding music and the chorus was catchy even though I didn't know what it meant.  Most CD's I have bought recently like Britney and Christina only have a couple of good songs and the rest of the CD I don't bother to listen to.  But with this CD you get about 8 very good songs and the other songs r pretty ok too.  I give this CD praise!!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|Now that the CD is out the jury is in! Here is a disc of pure magic that successfully documents just how cool the cast is in the musical vein. Renee Zellweger is in fine voice and has just the right sound for Roxie the chanteuse. Catherine Zeta-Jones knows how to belt out songs like &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and really sell them. Richard Gere is a major surprise - his 'Razzle Dazzle' sparkles as much in pure vocal form as it did in the wonderfully cinematic form. Queen Latifah is well known for her Rap gifts, but here she sings like a Mae West or Sophie Tucker, completely immersed in her character. John O'Reilly has one of the best bands on the CD with his tender 'Mister Cellophane' number that evokes all the beauty of the old vaudeville theater tunes. The CD is well engineered and a welcome addition to all music lovers' libraries. Signed by: [...]
B00005YUPO|2.0|My daughter (12 months old) is a big fan of Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven, so I went out and bought Baby Bach and Baby Neptune.  I was very disappointed by Baby Bach even though it seems to entertain my daughter for about 10-15 minutes.  The excessive display of the children is annoying and seems to be the reason my daughter gets bored with the video.  Baby Neptune is cute and I like it, but my daughter won't have anything to do with it. I'm hoping that the other Baby Einstein videos are better because I just bought Baby Van Gogh and Baby Neighborhood Animals for her 1st birthday.   <br />I also recommend the Brainy Baby series.  The Brainy Baby Right Brain, Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven DVDs are my daughter's favorites.
0780020685|5.0|one of the greatest and most influencial movies of all time. a classic in every aspect of the sense. should be watched by anyone who considers themselves a movie fan, truely a masterpiece. for the time (1954) truely a groundbreaking and epic film.
B00009W0U4|2.0|Although I realize Gaspar Noe's entire idea was to shock viewers, I can't help but be disgusted by him and his film. 'Irreversible' is certainly a film that challenges viewers. However, not in any conventional way. Noe challenges viewers to keep watching as a woman is brutually raped for 11 minutes. This scene is shown in all its horror without a single cut. The film is structured somewhat like &quot;Memento&quot; in that is is shown backwards. This is one of the redeming qualities of the film. The film opens with one of the most violent and realisitc looking scenes where a man is beaten with a fire extinguisher for sometime after he is alrady dead. His skull is smashed into what resembels a crushed melon. It seems like the ideas and and intesity of the film could have come across without all of this excessive brutality. The plot is basically that a man is searching for the man who raped his girlfriend. When in fact the true rapist is Noe himself.

0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones is an impressive work of fantasy, though the characters can be frustrating at times.  It is a fun read, and even though it's quite long, it's a short read, simply because of its page-turning ability.<br />I did not give this book 5 stars because I dislike reading works where the sex of the author is blindingly apparent.  I will continue to read this series because, don't get me wrong, I did thoroughly enjoy the book, however, I tire very quickly of battle scenes page after page, long descriptions of sword-play, and violent degradation of women.  Rape is very common in this book and there are few female characters that are sympathetic and strong.  I would rather have few female characters period, rather than several female characters that I really hate for their weak resolve and whiny personalities.<br />All that being said, however, I have not read the next book and the end of A Game of Thrones did hint at partly redeeming itself in A Clash of Kings.  It is good enough that I want to read the whole series but CERTAINLY not nearly as good as authors like Tolkien or Ursula Le Guin.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I fully disagree with Madame OBrien from Iceland. How can this album be a bore. This made Madonna!!! All the tracks take me back to my childhood. My faviroutes are &quot;Shoo - Be - doo&quot;, &quot; Dress You Up&quot; and &quot;Over and Over&quot;.<BR>Buy it. Trust me!! You'll love it
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Power in the Hollywood system comes from box office numbers. The more money your work earns for the studio owners, the more creative control you're allowed. Not everyone uses their newfound power wisely, however. \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" demonstrates this.<br />Some directors know how to leverage creative freedom. Ridley Scott, for example, is a director who always maintains careful control on his creative work from start to finish (though, thankfully, not to the degree of a Kubrick). As a result, the content of his films is always perfectly paced. You may not like the content, but that won't be because it's expressed badly.<br />Unfortunately it looks like the Wachowski brothers are an example of the other type of director, for whom newly-gained power becomes a club with which to beat down any attempt to restrain the story they want to tell.<br />The story of the Matrix is epic; like the Machine, it wants to transcend all limits to its growth. In making \\"The Matrix\\" this impulse was restrained, both financially and artistically, and the cinematic result was a perfect blend of story and presentation. In \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" these constraints were lifted. Without that discipline, the audiovisual side began growing like celluloid kudzu, and wound up choking off the story.<br />To put it simply, every scene in this movie is about 20 percent too long. From Neo's mid-movie fight with Smith 2.0, to the conversation with the Oracle, to the top-of-the-truck fight, to the Neo/Trinity love scene, to the staircase fight, to the Big Dance Number -- all of these scenes, and many others, were just too long. All these scenes should have been edited down to the exact amount necessary to tell the story, but they weren't. Halfway through them, we got the point, but the directors wouldn't let us move on. They lingered... and we got bored.<br />The result was a reasonably good movie that was less fun to watch than it should have been because it dragged. I can't help but assume that, nowthat the directors have the power to push exactly the vision they want, they're unwilling to accept any limits to translating what they see in their imaginations onto the big screen. Thus, scenes that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor -- not because they were \\"bad,\\" but because they didn't add anything useful to the scene -- were retained because the directors couldn't bear to cut them and no one from the studio said \\"no.\\"<br />This problem of \\"falling in love with your work\\" (and thus becoming unwilling to revise or cut scenes that don't help tell the story) has always been a struggle for writers. In \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" the Wachowski brothers appear to have fought that same battle and lost.<br />Good story, great audio/visuals, bad pacing: 3 stars.
B00008CLOA|5.0|First things first: great album. I don't know if this version is worth the hype. Maybe I'm being a bit too generous with my stars.<br /><br />What I would like all owners to do is this: At the very end of the CD, when the immortal words are heard, \\"There's no dark side of the moon, really...\\" plug in your headphones & turn the volume knob to 11. Does anyone else hear a muzac version of The Beatles \\"Ticket To Ride\\" very softly in the background?
B000002JKA|5.0|OK, let's not mince words - even though it's not in the right order, has filler and forgot to include its closer (\\"To Live Forever\\"), this album is amazing.  Once you clear the first three tracks, hold on to your hat.  Hardly any CD sounds as good or delivers half as much punch as this tour-de-force.  It's no wonder the two best tracks on their God-forsaken 1998 live album were the two tracks taken from this album (the songs work independent of the band's performance).  The writing, the performance, the mix - they all set new standards that hardly any albums since have approached (sadly, including ones the band itself has produced).
B00005B4GU|4.0|I hate the sayings of how \\"Amnesiac\\" are the leftovers of \\"Kid A.\\"  Yes, the sounds are similar to \\"Kid A,\\" and so what if they were all recorded at/around the same time/sessions. I find myself leaning more towards this album than the previous.  I'll admit, it's hard to find something to top \\"How To Disappear Completly,\\" but I easily found myself being pulled by all of the songs (with the exception of \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\").  The horns and clarinet on \\"Life In A Glasshouse\\" can be a bit aggravating, but Radiohead more than compensates with the rest of the album (\\"Like Spinning Plates\\" especially.)<BR>I'm all for their experimentation and the playing with the music and Radiohead have proven themselves more than worthy for the praise they have received.<BR>If given the chance, see them live.  It's one thing to hear a cd, but to see genius at work is another.  It's a spiritual experience to say the least.
B00008VPUP|5.0|I rarely say this about an animated film (with the exception of \\"Beauty & The Beast\\") but \\"The Lion King\\" is truly one of the best films all around, animated or not. The story writing is exceptional, delving into honor, loyalty, and family. The animation is top notched. I have been waiting for this day when \\"The Lion King\\" is available to the public to buy. I missed buying it when I saw the movie and fell in love with it. Today, I immediately went to Target just a block away from where I work and picked up a copy of \\"The Lion King\\" on tape (yes, I still live in the dark ages and use a vcr). Good thing I went there early in the morning 'cause there were just a few copies of the movie left. I just finished watching the movie and to this very day, I still get emotional when a grown up Simba climbs Pride Rock. The fight scene between Simba and Scar is still breathtaking. I definitely agree with the critics that \\"The Lion King\\" is certainly not for the \\"Rugrats\\", \\"Spongebob Squarepants\\" crowd. The scare factor of \\"The Lion King\\" gets an 8 out of 10 on my scale. Even I still get the chills when a young Simba and Nala explore the ravine where the hyenas live, and naturally the tragic death of a main character. Whoopi Goldberg was hilarious as one of the hyenas. They added both a scare factor as well as a comedy element to the film. Jeremy Irons did an outstanding job as Scar. And of course no one can do Mousfasa (excuse my spelling) as well as James Earl Jones did. After watching \\"The Lion King\\" for the first time in many, many years, I am still amazed by how well it has stood up to the test of time in terms of storywriting as well as animation. The quality in animation is subtle but I could still see the improvement. \\"The Lion King\\" remains a masterpiece to this very day. It is one of the few family friendly films that I can sit through without going into a sugar shock.
B00004XONN|4.0|It's funny when I sit back and think to when Radiohead first broke onto the music scene, I really didn't care for them.  Yes, &quot;Creep&quot; appealed to me a bit, but I just like to believe that I wasn't ready yet to take their music and vision in full.<BR>It took me &quot;Street Spirit&quot; (The Bends) and &quot;Karma Police&quot; (OK Computer) to realize what exactly I was missing out on.<BR>This album was given to me as a gift years ago and it still has a grasp on me and my stereo.  It was the first Radiohead album I owned and while it isn't my favorite, it does hold some significance to me.<BR>I find it fascinating to look at how much Radiohead has evolved music wise over the years.  While it may have jaded some of their fans, I found their experimentations added onto the appeal for me.  I'm not going to spit out mantras of how I think they are the greatest band in the world right now, but I do think they don't get half as much credit as they deserve.  And I do think that 20 years down the line they will still be listened to by many.  <BR>It's disappointing to listen to the radio these days and hear nothing but songs about &quot;bling bling&quot; and crap @ss love songs from 16 year olds who don't even know what the hell they're singing about.  And please don't get me started on all the rock bands out there that all sound the same! I can't tell the difference between them half the time.  And as you may well guess, the only station around here that plays Radiohead is the public radio station.<BR>Upon seeing them live in New Orleans recently, it only added to my appreciation of these guys. It's comforting to know that there are some who aren't conforming to the regular genres just to please the masses and sell a few more records.  With this album, some may appreciate the different path they chose to take and some won't.  <BR>The strongest tracks to me are &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; but my personal favorites are &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;  There is just something so haunting about those two songs that pulls at me.   I'll admit, I'm a lyrics person and this was probably the first album where I didn't first focus on the lyrics but the texture of the music itself.  All I can say is that I'm in awe of Radiohead's (Jonny Greenwood's especially) many musical talents.<BR>While I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to a first time Radiohead listener, (I'd go with The Bends or OK Computer) I would recommend this to someone who wants to step out of the musical box.  You'd be surprised with what comes out.
0375703764|5.0|first of all, this book doesn't rank with pynchon's &quot;gravity's rainbow&quot;.  in fact, it doesn't really stand to comparisons of any kind.  it is in a class all it's own.<br />Danielewiski has synthesized poetry, philosophy and street smarts to create a genre all his own.  the character of johnny truant is a bit cardboard, and i don't think even the most hardened thug is quite this 'cold'; in this sense, he makes the mistake of needing his characters to fit a too rigid profile.<br />while truant is a loveable caricature, navidson is believable; a passionate nietzschean with a sense of purpose that cannot be shaken by family, convention, etc. the blurbs about navidson in interviews and the text are invaluable.  the author drives his point across in the increasingly insane and coherent text; there is no meaning to human life (as evidenced by navidson's frantic pursuit of the house's &quot;basement&quot;, or endless darkness.)<br />don't waste your money, however, on the &quot;whalestone letters&quot;.  the letters from truant (gee, maybe the last name means something? gimme a break) must be nothing more than a big by the author to make money.  but &quot;house of leaves&quot; is an anomaly, the kind of beautiful abberation that ends up on high school reading lists because of it's strange greatness.  read it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me, the things people feel entitled to say about Radiohead and their art. They are one of a precious few in music today with the courage and creative passion to take their music to another level. OK Computer stands firmly as one of the most brilliant and progressive albums of the 90's. It is shear genius, though it is also quite abstract. It is this trait and this trait alone which has scared so many of the reviewers who have dared to give this album a low review. It is understandable if you do not like this album, it is not for everybody, but to degrade it the way so many have is just offensive. The very idea of a Justin Timberlake or Limp Bizkit fan taking shots at Radiohead is just pathetic. If that is the type of music you enjoy then that is fine, but don't consider yourself to be on the same level as this album (and this band for that matter). OK Computer is not an album that you will be blaring in your car stereo system while you're out partying with your friends. It is an album which requires the listeners devoted attention. It is for those with an open enough mind to accept and embrace something new and challenging but ultimately beautiful.
B000089RVR|5.0|Well, coming from the UK and having read a few reviews for Dido's forthcoming album 'Life For Rent' I was all too ready to dismiss this album before hearing it... I finally gave in and bought it and am so glad I did! Firstly, if you're expecting another 'No Angel' then you will be deeply disappointed!<BR>This is very much a more raw, edgier and experimental album than 'No Angel' was; gone are the catchy choruses and polished production values and instead we get a myriad of eclectic styles which are all so poignant. Standouts are 'White Flag', 'Life For Rent', 'Do You Have A Little Time' and 'This Land Is Mine'. She is a singer/songwriter of the highest calibre and is to be treasured

B0000AXE8I|5.0|I am a Matrix fan, otherwise I would not take the time to write down my comments.  I can see why many would not like this sequel, compared to the first, it wasn't as good.  It was different.  It would be interesting to know whether the producers of this movie planned all three movies when they released the Matrix or if they planned the 2nd and 3rd installments after the great success of the first.  <br />Eitherway, this is a great movie.  The plot, action, background music, and special effects combine to produce a great visual display.  The only problem I had was in a few of the scenes the special effects (I thought) looked move like a video game rather than actual live action.<br />In regards to the plot, you either get it or you don't.  If you do, there are several different levels on which the plot exists; from the obivious to the sublime.  I am not about to compare the Matrix to some eastern mythology or some poet, but I am sure some correlation could be made.  However, if you take the time to notice the little things in both this and the first movie, you can start to understand. I have watched both movies several times and still come away with something new.<br />Eitherway, this is a great movie.  However, I think the success will depend on the final movie where (hopefully) everything is wrapped up.
0780627024|5.0|Pleasantville may be one of the best, most underrated movies of all time.  I admit, when it was first released, the premise seemed a bit goofy:  two teenagers (played by then-unknown actors) are suddenly cast into a Leave It To Beaver-like classic TV town called Pleasantville by none other than Don Knotts (reminds you a little of the forgettable &quot;Stay Tuned,&quot; doesn't it?).  Upon their arrival, however, they discover that Pleasantville isn't everything it's cracked up to be and that being &quot;pleasant&quot; means missing out on some basic, vital parts of life (such as toilets, and of course, sex).  What follows is an amazing transformation:  of the main characters, the town, and even the movie itself, whose stunning cinematography slowly adds bursts of color to Pleasantville's black and white world while simultaneously providing a metaphor for the race conflicts of the 1950s and 60s.  The two unknown actors turn out to be the now-famous Tobey Maguire and Reese Whitherspoon, both of whom shine like the stars they are in one of their first movies.  Added to this are excellent supporting performances by some of the best in the business, including William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, and the late great character actor J.T. Walsh.  An absolutely incredible, must-see film.
B00005ASOI|4.0|If you were to make a list of the top 10 best horror films of all time it might look something like this (keep in mind this is a list of well known horror films).. 1. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 2. THE EXORCIST 3. DAWN OF THE DEAD 4. SUSPIRIA 5. PSYCHO 6. EVIL DEAD 7. NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST. (part one) 8. HALLOWEEN 9. ALIENS 10. CREEPSHOW ..Now if you've heard of this film you've likely heard of the other films on this list. As an adult I don't become scared when I watch horror films, I have way to much knowledge on how movies are made to ever really become frightened while viewing. However, the titles listed above are great horror films to me. And I'm not saying that I don't jump sometimes when something on screen jumps at you with intense music to back it up, we all love when that happens. I'm 28 years old and I've been a fan of horror films ever since I was still in the single digits, do you remember the first time you saw a zombie rise from the grave? It was like losing some kind of virginity. As for this horror masterpiece.. any horror film that has witches, zombies, fire, numorous violent murders of ballet dancers, &amp; a soundtrack by the devil will always get high marks in my book.
1881273156|5.0|How's your relationship with your mate? Your children? Your parents? Your siblings? It may be a matter of the state of the &quot;love tank&quot;.<br />Author Gary Chapman in his book The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate believes everyone has a love tank, and that tank is filled by different love languages. These five languages are Gifts, Words of Affirmation, Quality of Time, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.<br />Often, we tend to give love in the languages we are most fluent in, which usually ends up being the languages that fill up our love tank. This would be why a husband who does yard work, dishes, car maintenance, etc. (Acts of Service) is floored when his wife says &quot;You never show me you love me. You never cuddle with me, or caress my hair, or make the first move for sex.&quot; (Physical Touch). Or, &quot;Why don't you spend time with me? Why do you work so much?&quot; (Quality Time). And, &quot;Why don't you buy me flowers? Why don't you ever get me cards or balloons...just because?&quot; (Gifts) Or &quot;You never tell me what I mean to you. Why don't you ever share with me what I mean to you, or what my good qualities are?&quot; (Words of Affirmation) But, if her language is primarily Acts of Service, she'll feel so loved and honored because her husband does so many things for her, and thus feels &quot;full&quot; in her love tank.<br />This may not sound like a big deal, but considering the divorce rate is 50% (as one relationship instance), and so many seem to be unhappy with their primary relationships, the concept of love languages may very well be a signficant factor in understanding self and others, and in relationship growth. Perhaps relationships get rocky or arrive at an impasse because individuals are speaking a different love language than what fills up the &quot;love tank&quot; of the object of their affection...and a result, the recipient doesn't feel loved. It's not that they feel empty and unfufilled because love isn't being given, but because the language &quot;spoken&quot; is not something that registers to the recipient as a form of love.<br />Chapman further theorizes that we usually have 2 main love languages that fill up our tank. He also says that if a person has a hard time identifying their main love languages, they've either been on empty for so long and are out of touch with their needs, or they have been so filled up by their spouse, that all 5 languages tend to speak to them equally.<br />A story in the book that illustrates the love tank theory is the &quot;burnt toast syndrome&quot;. A woman was sick in bed. Her husband would always bring her burnt toast to her when she was ailing. She was so hurt and offended by this repeated insensitivity and ignorance, that she finally burst into tears one day, and asked him why he did that...and didn't he care? She was floored to hear him say &quot;I'm sorry honey. I had no idea. Burnt toast is my favorite, and I gave you what I would consider my favorite breakfast...burnt toast.&quot;<br />Chapman writes: &quot;When your spouse's emotional love tank is full and he feels secure in your love, the whole world looks right and your spouse will move out to reach his highest potential in life. But when the love tank is empty and he feels used but not loved, the whole world looks dark and he will likely never reach his potential for good in the world.&quot;<br />I recommend this book highly.

B000002MG1|5.0|It was Saturday October 4th and I called my brother thinking he might want to go for a drink and after a few moments of conversation he told me he had two extra REM tickets at Madison Square Garden. Now I had not listened for a while and thought this would be a great way to rekindle why I liked them so much, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The real reason why I reflect upon this Album was because of three songs from this Album performed which made me go back and listen and recognize how good this album was. Hearing Drive, Man on the Moon and a particularly emotional version of Nightswimming conjured up memories of why I bought this album and made me wonder why I hadn't listened to it in a long time. Listening to other songs like The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight, Everybody Hurts and Find the River just made me think that this is one of the best and varied albums in my collection because I never feel like I need to skip over a song as I do with other REM albums. I'm certainly glad I made a phone call to my brother this past saturday and relish listening to this album for many years to come.

No filler.Every up and coming band and artist should learn this and study it.Every artist/group now should make this required listening....James Brown kicks ass!!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I love this CD.  It's definetly one of their better ones.  Dance of Death is a great tune.  Only thing missing is that truly epic feeling song like Alexander the Great.  Paschendale comes close.  Sure it's a long song, but it just doesn't feel epic to me.  Still a good tune.  Few minor complaints but otherwise a great CD!  Just in time too!  I'm really getting bored of the growl-and-tune-your-guitar-so-low-the-strings-rattle nu-metal...
B000002UAR|5.0|From Rubber Soul to the end of their careers, The Beatles batted a thousand with each album.  Revolver, the second album in that series, is easily one of the best.  It deftly combines the Beatles sweet and melodic pop songs (&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;), comic lyrics (&quot;Taxman&quot;) and an initial forray into musical experiments (&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;) into a classic pop album that Oasis only wishes it could make!  Although Revolver doesn't contain too many of the bajillion radio staples that the Beatles have made over the years it is still among their strongest and most statisfying albums.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I just saw Concert for George the Film this weekend...well actually I saw it twice!!! Besides being a fan of George Harrison & The Beatles there are wonderful performances by Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne & Eric Clapton of course! If you are a world music fan than there is  great piece by Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka which is so so moving. However, if you think this movie is a downer and just a tear jerker it's not! It has 2 great sketches from The Monty Pythons!!!! So Hilarious...I really think the film captured so many different sides of George...his spirutual side to his great sense of humor! I encourage people to see it on the big screen!!!! You will thank me!!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|After recording the ragged album Let it Be (which I still think is a good album) The Beatles were ready to break up.  Convinced to hold on for one more album, the Fab Four released this gem.  Everything about it is perfect, you have the best of the Beatles rock (Come Together), their pop ballads (Something) and musical experiments (the suite on side two).  You can't do any better than this!  Usually suites on a rock album result in an overindulgent mess, but here it is stirring.  If you don't have it, you need it... trust me!
B00006BIO0|3.0|ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY WHAT PATTON IS SAYING BUT ITS THERE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I HAVE TO SAY IT IS A GOOD RECORDING. THAT DARK HAUNTING AND EERIE SOUND IS PART OF THE BLUES AND NO ONE DID IT BETTER FOR HIS TIME THAN CHARLEY PATTON HIMSELF. HE WAS THE BEST AND THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWD AFTER HIM INCLUDING ROBERT JOHNSON SHOW HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IVE WALWAYS SAID IF ANY ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO THE GREATONES AND CHARLEY WAS JUST THAT SO ILL GIVE 3 1/2 STARS TO A VERY GOOD COLLECTION. OH AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY OTHER RECORDINGS OF HIS WORK FORGET IT THIS IS THE BEST REMASTERD AND RESTORED COLLECTION OF HIS WORK ON THE MARKET.
B00005JLZN|3.0|Upon its release earlier this year, The Life of David Gale was slammed by critics as a preachy anti-death penalty drama with Kevin Spacey trying desperately to turn himself into a weepy martyr.  Is it true?  Well, yes.  The script is mediocre and seems like a hipster sunday school lesson, subplots (like the people who follow Kate Winslet around, etc.) seem overwrought and distracting to the film,  and the twist at the end makes the protagonists look crazy.  So why a 3 star rating?  Well, Laura Linney does a great job as an anti-death penalty crusader who is close to the title character and even though Spacey has had a run of movies where he plays &quot;the good guy/martyr&quot; he does a convincing job as an alcoholic professor bent on doing something good with his wasted life.  However, I'm getting tired of the &quot;good&quot; Spacey, give me the back-stabbing sly bad guy that I've known and loved!  Anyway, you might want to rent this on a dollar movie night and see how great actors can try to rescue so-so movies.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Being a cheapskate and already owning the Degradation Trip single album, I hesitated to shell out again for the double album, but I am so glad I did.  All I can say is that Jerry Cantrell is a freakin' genius and this album is excellent.  The songs I hadn't heard already are fantastic.  Well worth buying even if you have the single album.
0312983867|5.0|I have read the first 7 Stephanie Plum novels and liked them all. This one I liked the best. I laughed out loud many times throughout the book. It does help to have read the first seven books and to know the history of Stephanie's relationships with Ranger and Morelli and to follow their development.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Bound revolves around three key characters. The first is a gangster named Caesar ( Joe Pantoliano). The second is his mistress Violet (Jennifer Tilly). The third is a woman named Corky ( Gina Gershon) who was just released from prison and also moved into the same building as Caesar and Violet. Although Violet is involved with Caesar, she can't help developing a strong infatuation with Corky. The story takes an interesting turn when Corky and Violet become lovers. The two lovers then slowly develop a plan to steal 2 million dollars from the mob, and frame Caesar in the process. <br />\\"Bound\\" is a great film. The overall suspense is nail-biting. Another thing I like about this movie, is the fact that it is laid out extremely well, and leaves no loose ends at all. You don't end up feeling confused, or wondering why the film happened the way that it did. Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly have great chemistry in this film and provide passionate love scenes and a partnership that is extremely solid. It really is fun to watch the two women work together in and out of the bedroom. Joe Pantoliano however gives the film's best performance. He plays the role of an angry mobster perfectly, as well as the confused mark who never knew what hit him. Watching him lose control is great. <br />The DVD itself is excellent. Not only is it affordable, but it also includes the unrated version of the film and commentary from the directors, as well as Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano. I highly recommend this movie!!
0671004107|2.0|I saw the movie before reading the novel.  In the novel, Ellie Arroway isn't as annoying as the movie's Ellie Arroway: she is not constantly criticizing religion.  The movie spent too much time focusing on the question of religion versus science.  It is a theme in the novel, but the theme is not as in-your-face as in the movie (for example, Hadden and his Preachnix device).<br />Unfortunately, the novel is very awkward at introducing backstory: a character is introduced and then the next few paragraphs give a quick biographical sketch of the character.  Personally, I'd rather have the backstory of a character introduced in pieces and in surprises.  For example, Palmer Joss could have been a much more interesting character if his backstory were introduced much slowly.  These sketches should have been editted out.<br />The last chapter of the novel, was much better than the movie's end.  It would've been nice to see what Ellie did with that information from her mother's letter.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg team up to bring us &quot;The Goonies.&quot; The Goonies are a group of kids that love to go on crazy adventures and have a &quot;never say die&quot; attitude. They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot. <br />Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially &quot;One - Eyed&quot; Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and &quot;truffle shuffle&quot; will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.<br />The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre. <br />The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general. The movie itself and the amazing DVD make it a must own!
1577311523|3.0|Another one of those &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; books then. This one seems better than most, since it emphasises the present, as opposed to past lives or predicting the future. On the other hand, it's all very well to talk about &quot;now&quot; as the best time to seize the moment, etc. but what about people who don't have the option? It's like taunting them; they feel like they're missing out, while everyone is talking about how great &quot;now&quot; is. &quot;Now&quot; is the latest thing - get yours before it's too late. Talking about &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot; at all is always a bit iffy too - it can be a bit like an exclusive club catering to people's need for belonging. I wouldn't necessarily accuse this book of that, however. In fact I wouldn't accuse it of much at all, since I haven't read it and have no intention of doing so. It's just not my kind of thing, although I did read an Alan atts book once...
B00005JM0B|1.0|Well... I hoped it would never come to this, but I'm here to complain about a Terminator film. \\"Terminator 3\\" ofcoarse... After growing up watching \\"The Terminator\\" and then especially \\"Terminator 2\\" I gained a great appreciation for the time and effort that James Cameron put into making his films. The reality that he situated into both of the films(T1,T2) created a greatly loved and charised story, that everyone enjoyed watching. But apparently the same effort was never put into the creation of \\"Terminator 3\\"... It sickens me that someone would take something that another person worked so hard on, and continue it without putting forth any effort at all. A story with actual meaning... where we can change our future for the better, and save what existence we have left... but T3 completely obliterates that idea saying that everything is anevitable, completely changing Cameron's original ideals being portrayed on film. Instead any real story ideas are thrown in the trash, and are replaced with extremely unrealistic situations, fueled with explosions and destruction, making yet another pathetic and pointless low quality action film. Coarse in the end run I wouldn't dought the making of this film was but a quick desperation for money gained primarily from the name created by James Cameron. This film is a mockery to the other Terminator films, and shouldn't even be considered truelly part of the highly irresistable and creative Terminator storyline. In the end, I believe this film completely insults the audience(especially those of the other 2 films). Well that's basically my opinion summed up real fast. Sorry I couldn't get more technical about it...
0671799320|5.0|This book is a complete and thorough history of the most important natural resource.  Its reach is unequalled.  From the beginning of the industry in western Pennsylvania to oil's modern strategic importance, the book is simply awesome in scope.  Yergin does an excellent job of telling the story and backing it with plenty of source information and footnotes.  <br />After reading this book, I see World War II in a completely new way.  Oil as a strategic resource has changed the face of warfare.  I always knew this, but couldn't tell you exactly why.  After reading this book, I can tell you why.  I loved the history of the Germans' and Japanese efforts at synthetic fuels productions.  This book also contains a good chapter about the Iran-Iraq war, a topic that has been relatively difficult to find good information on.<br />If I was forced to make one critical comment about this book I would say that I would have liked to have had one chapter describing some of the basic technical processes involved in refining oil.  But with such a long and informative book, I suppose everybody could list &quot;one&quot; more chapter that they would have liked.<br />Read this book.
630463949X|5.0|If you haven't seen the original 1970's shows of Fleetwood Mac, this is an excellent example of the chemistry and talent of a group with timeless songs.  The entire band puts so much energy into the show.  Great example of the group for a fan.  They Rock!
0451527046|5.0|In an inn in the year of our grace 1700. A captain sits at a table with rum in his hand singing, \\"Fifteen men on the dead man's chest, yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! This was a captain that lived in the inn of the Hawkins. Jim Hawkins yet a boy helps the captain till the captain has a stroke. Jim takes care of the captain and learns of the chest that the captain wants Jim to keep when the captain dies. Eventually the captain dies and Jim finds a treasure map from the chest that the captian gave him. This map leads them  on treasure hunt into the open sea. Jim finds himself on ship with pirates. Would u like to know how they get out of this one you got to read this book to find out.<BR>       <BR>      I like this book for its adventure it gives. I think people who are in to sea stuff and pirates should definitely read this book. I think this would be a good book for anybody who wants to read. It has everything needed to keep you in the story. I give it a five star rating because I think it is a good book for everbody.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This movie is one of Al Pacino's best performances(like that hasn't been said before).  The 2 disc anniversary edition is great and the extras and documentaries are very interesting and informative.  But the one GLARING thing that sticks out about this dvd is: WHY THE DEF JAM SPECIAL?? What does rappers and a movie about a cuban drug dealer have to do with rap?? Maybe I'm a moron and don't get it... it wasn't that interesting to watch and a waste of my 20 minutes.  That aside, this is a great movie.  Not for the easily offended. Pacino's 1993 movie &quot;Carlito's Way&quot; is worth checking out for fans of this movie.  It would be a continuation of Scarface if Tony Montana would have lived(the hint being the final shot of Carlito's way with the murial).
B00005JLSE|5.0|&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; reinvented the rock movie musical.  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; basically reinvented the concept of a movie musical, period.  And now, &quot;Chicago&quot; has revived the brassy, Broadway musical on the silver screen.<br />Purists will wince and whine at casting choices and production values, but in the end the question must be asked, &quot;Does it work?&quot;<br />The resounding answer must be YES!  The movie is fun and captures the feel of a Fosse musical.  I do believe that Bob Fosse himself would have enjoyed this production.  Gwen Verdon would as well, I think.<br />Including Queen Latifah shows the daring and the risks the producers took, but it also shows how interested they were in bringing this book to the broadest audience possible.<br />Yes, I would have loved to have seen Bebe Newirth up there on the screen, but every member of the cast holds their own, including Richard Gere (which I seriously didn't expect).<br />As for the DVD, I would like to have seen more extras, but I guess those can wait for the collector's edition.  For now, this package is enough.<br />So here's to more musicals!  Hopefully they will be as good as this one.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The matrix reloaded, considered by many was no comparison to its first, The Matrix. Honestly i do not see why people rip this movie as bad as they do. The further story of zion and the matrix is much more complex, as it should be. The first Matrix was a good, slim, to the point, movie and it could be. Reloaded requires much more explaining and therefore there is much more fillers and and a larger scale plot. This is the reason why i only gave 4-stars, because of plot execution. There are some scenes that should not have have been in the movie and only add minutes, but nothing neccessary to the story. As an example, the rave scene was useless, and could have dropped a good 10 minutes from the movie. Also the plot conflicts somewhat with that if the first matrix. At the end of The Matrix, Neo is held at the status of a God, but in Reloaded he has weaknesses. I suppose this is because of the complexity of the plot. As for the action...no other movie hails in comparison to Reloaded, Its action and graphics were state of the art and very powerful. No where else have i have a more realistic flying scene than this movie. Personally the flying scenes alone made the movie for me. There is also still the good one-on-one fights with humans, agents, machines, etc. and the classic \\"bullet-time,\\" motion. Altogether the movie is lengthy, but its fun and it works. It retains complexity of its matrix centerpiece but still has action that anyone can have a good time watching...Cant wait until Revolutions
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower is an inspiring guitarist. He wasn't particularly fast but his playing is, oh so tasty. His sound is quite Hendrix inspired and if you know anything about Robin you'll understand why. The singer on this disc, the late Jimmy Dewar had one of the great deep rock voices. Just listen to, &quot;About To Begin&quot;, or &quot;In This Place.&quot;  He will be missed. Every song on this disc is a classic, Robin could teach everyone a thing or two about using a wah wah pedal. Just listen to the intro to, &quot;Too Rolling Stoned.&quot; I used to listen to this recording on my way to band practice. I am sure it made me play better. I know it made me listen pretty darn well too.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Kathryn Murteuil and her Step brother Sebastian Valmont are 2 popular, smart, manipulative, wealthy upper class New York teenagers with one year left at their school Manchester Prep. Kathryn and Sebastian are the most popular students at their school, Kathryn is polite, lady-like and beautiful, Sebastian has slept with most of the Upper East Side with has conjured up his popular reputation.<BR>However through all their luxury, wealth and popularity Kathryn and Sebastian are experiencing the boredom that the long summer holidays provide.<BR>Kathryn was dumped over the fourth of July weekend by her boyfriend Court for an innocent girl called Cecille. To revenge him Kathryn hopes to make Cecille a slut humiliating Court. Cecille's mother organizes for Kathryn to \\"tutor\\" Cecille over the summer holidays hoping that she will turn into a replica of Kathryn fit for a popular reputation at Manchester, However Kathryn intends to turn Cecille into \\"the premier tramp of the new York area\\".<BR>Sebastians \\"summer project\\" is to screw the new headmaster's daughter Annette before school starts. This would add to his reputation greatly because Annette recently wrote a manifesto in seventeen magazine stating how she declared her virginity until marriage. Kathryn has little faith in Sebastians new mission and through their love hate relationship she makes a bet that if he screws the new headmasters daughter before school starts she will have sex with him (something that Sebastian has always wanted but couldn't have) but if he doesn't Kathryn gets his 1956 jaguar roadster. <BR>The bet goes out of control as Kathryn amuses herself with Sebastian trying to keep his dignity. Annette, Cecille, Kathryn and Sebastian all intertwine to create lust and betrayal. But soon Kathryn and Sebastian receive the consequences of the way they treat others in the dramatic ending.<BR>What I loved about the film was the general story line because it created the basis for the movie but also the wealth andsnobbiness involved that was very entertaining to watch. Also the soundtrack music was excellent and complemented the movie and its character very well. The acting was sensational with some of Hollywood's finest actors including Ryan Phillipe (Sebastian Valmont), Sara Michelle Gellar (Kathryn Merteuil), Reese Witherspoon (Annette Hargrove) and Selma Blare (Cecille Caldwell).
B00005JKG9|5.0|...Someone referred me to this movie and I found what I was missing.  I do love it so!!!  Some have said that Alec Baldwin's seven minutes are the best dialogue in movie history!  No argument there.  This movie with its incredible cast captures the whole aura of high-stress sales...to a T!<BR>Anyone in sales knows.  I can't stress how great this movie was.<BR>On a positive note, I used the movie to motivate me to work my own \\"Glengarry Leads\\" to fruition.  Thank God I didn't have to deal with anyone's \\"Nostalgia File\\"!!!

630439845X|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen yet. Though Hunter seems to have little expression on her face this is not true. Her eyes and the slight movments of her mouth and eye brows truly express what she is feeling and just how deeply she feels. Flora is a bit over the top with the brat act but it is obvious why she is like this. Harvey Keitel does great with his intense character. You can feel the lust and even a little bit of passion that he feels for Ada. Over all I think it has a good story line and rather good character development. This is a movie definatly for those of us that are a bit more artistic and passionate about it.  I probably wouldn't recomend this for childern under 14 (maybe even 17) because of the nudity but it is entirly up to you.

B00008EY9G|5.0|I loved this movie. even though I figured out the plot twists I still enjoyed every second of it. why? because this is a movie with a great idea, played out in a great way with great actors. I really felt like I could believe that these are real people and this is how they would react in a situation, diferently. not all the characters are the same and they are played very different. <BR>    one thing I need to adress is all you idiots out there who ruin movies for people, you are the lowest scum to walk the face of the earth. don't take the joys of watching a movie with twists because you didn't like it, don't be that childish to want to get that revenge. just stop and think if you would want to know how every movie ended. If you feel you have to give something away a good idea is to type something like SPOILER so people who don't watn to know what happens don't have to.
B000089RVR|4.0|She's an amazing singer and songwriter.  I liked &quot;life for rent&quot; but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have the same flavour as &quot;no angel&quot;.  In this albumn, I feel that Dido has softened her music.  Her ability to convey emotions and feeling through her music is still there but I felt that there was a lack of &quot;edge&quot; in her music.  I kept expecting her to blow me away during a chorus (like how she wailed on &quot;here with me&quot; in the last minute of the song. now, THAT was amazing!), but I found myself being let down.  However, Im recommending this album to any Dido fan anyway. I love Dido's voice and introspective lyrics.  She is a musical genius and even with the softer, somewhat sadder sounds of &quot;life for rent&quot;, Dido is sure to be a good listen

B00006F7S4|5.0|I didn't expect it, but this album is a masterpiece.  It's a little depressing(this will keep it from mainstream) but you can't argue with the actual music.  Excellent lyrics for the first time in Beck's career.  I am so glad that Beck has finally lost his goofy and not funny lyrics altogether,(I wish primus would do the same).  This album is also less genre jumping and more focused on just being a good album.  It's basically a folk album with a country tinge, just done better than I've heard in a release since Bob Dylan.

0385504209|3.0|This is above average for a mystery thriller and is an entertaining read. However, almost inevitably, it has a hard job keeping up with the hype. The premise is interesting and, provided you are able to suspend disbelief, it's OK. Due to the innumerable minor errors however, such suspension is difficult. The questionable historical theories put forward are addressed in other reviews. On a far more pragmatic level - GPS cannot do what it is said to do in this book (why are so many authors in love with modern technology without being capable of understanding its limitations?) and the hand built british sports car briefly referred to is an Aston Martin, not an Astin Martin. Minor points I know but capable of instantly dispelling credibility.
B00005JLK1|1.0|Where do I start for Ghost Ship? I guess that this movie should've remained just that..A Ghost.<BR>The storyline is flat, the acting is mediocre, do not expect this movie to make you jump off your seat or make you scream. Like the japanese version of &quot;The Ring&quot; Ghost Ship mostly relies on the musical effects and like &quot;Ringu&quot; it fails to achieve the desired results. If you want a REALLY good thriller, try the american version of &quot; The Ring&quot; or even &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; both great movies.<BR>The only scary part about Ghost Ship...it's the price of the DVD!

B000002JOH|5.0|&quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot; is probably the best Pantera album ever released! With songs like &quot;walk&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot;, and &quot;Mouth For War&quot;, it defines the words &quot;Heavy Music.&quot; Phil Anselmo and Dimebag Darrel shine on the lesser know tracks &quot;Regular People (Conceit)&quot;, &quot;Rise&quot;, and &quot;A New Level.&quot; It's too bad that Pantera split up, but this CD proves that their music will never die. No more needs to be said about this classic. Oh, be sure to pick up Pantera's new greatest hits CD, that features &quot;Walk&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;, plus &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot;<BR>&quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, and &quot;Drag The Waters.&quot;

0743424425|4.0|There is no wonder why stephen king is the master of the suspense and horror novel today. His first three books, Carrie, Salem's Lot and The Shining marked a breakthrough for horror novels on many levels.   Although The Shining was slower than what I anticipated , I found the book to be amazingly realistic.  In the 70's Stephen King wrote a horror novel around the ordinary or not so ordinary lives of a family,  King develops the characters by letting them reveal themselves through thought. Inbetween the dialogs you find what the characters are really thinking in parenthesis. You find out that the father is truely struggling with his self worth and alcholism, The mother is struggling with her love for her family and the distruss of the husband as well as her constant worrying about things in general. And finally ,but most importantly you find out about the sons conflict with his kinetic powers, while also trying to understand life through an child's mind.     All of this is what makes stephen king a master. Not the horror itself. By the end of the book, the reader truely cares about that family. In a lot of ways you feel sorry for the father who is, after all the things he's been through, haunted and possessed by the house. It makes the end more sad than horrific.     For those who saw the movie, don't expect the same story. as always it's different, but Kubrick's version is even more of an interpretation than most novel to movie transitions. Overall, in the movie you get the sense that this family is a little weird even before they get to the house. The father , in jack nicholson's portrayal, is frazzeled and wide eyed in the very beginning of the movie. The mother is this overly passive human being that in no way could've realistically survived the ending. And the boys portrayal is just flat out weird.  In the book the family is basically a normal family with realistic troubles that eventually turn into horrific ones.    The only negative point I have with the book, is that it appears that in King's earlier novels he struggles with the supernatural aspect of the story.  Why didn't the ghost possess the boy instead? Especially if that's who they were after in the first place. Also the fact that both the mother and the cook gets beaten by a mallet and still stands and walks around defies the realistic aspect of the terror.     Overall it's a good novel about the struggles of an everyday family with a haunting twist.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Donna Summer is timeless and I adore her.  Ever so often the classic artists come out with a greatest hits CD and it's nothing new.  (Paul Simon, Elton John, the Beatles, the Carpenters, on and on and on release greatest hits to gather up new fans and to remind old fans who don't have a greatest hits package it's here).  <br />Love it!
B000002KIE|3.0|First things first: I passionately HATE Johnny Rotten (Lydon).  His music wasn't terrible (well, PIL was, ugh), but he is just such an idiot.  He comes off like a spoiled 12 year old rich boy who wanted to hang out on the other side of the tracks his whole life.  From his lame \\"everybody look at me\\" behavior in the early days to him being interviewed on MTV a few years back (it was like a 50 year old guy trying to act like he was a disgruntled 18 year old; VERY midlife crisis).  I think Sid, on the other hand, was great and very entertaining.  Too bad he's dead.<br />The songs on this album are all okay punk rock.  Very catchy, simple stuff that was made at precisely the right time for capitalization. But, unfortunately, this album does not, in any way, even come close to the genius of two other debut LPs by The Clash and The Ramones.
B000063DIR|5.0|This 1981/1982 album is probably my favorite Ozzy album, and is a whole lot better than &quot;Blizzard Of Ozz (1980)&quot; &amp; <BR>&quot;No More Tears&quot;, which are far too over-rated. &quot;Flying High Again&quot;, &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, &amp; &quot;Little Dolls&quot; are wicked heavy, and full of that great Randy Rhoads riffing and creepy lyrics by Ozzy. It's too bad that none of these great tracks are being played on the radio these days. After this album, Ozzy went into his &quot;glam-rock&quot; period (1983 - 1987), which was a dsigrace to his legend. The only album that even compares to this album's heaviness, is 1988's &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; with Zakk Wylde on the guitar. Ozzy may be a bonafied celebrity now, but his music will never get better than &quot;Diary of a Madman.&quot; Anything that Ozzy put out from 1983 to let's say 1986, and after the &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; era is commercially over-produced garbage. I recommend the 1995 edition of this album, which excludes the throwaway &quot;I Don't Know (live)&quot;, additional art work, and the re-recorded rhythm section. Also try <BR>&quot;No Rest For the Wicked (1988)&quot; &amp; &quot;Just Say Ozzy (1990).&quot;
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I thought 'The Matrix Reloaded' was a fantsastic film. <BR>The plot, though initially confusing and seemingly uneventful, is amazing in it's own right. As with most trilogies, it slows down a bit, to develop character. The enire 'rave' scene in the beginning was designed to show us how the inhabitants of Zion long for more simpler times, free of the complexity of the war. I have seen some complaints about the costumes on the 'ravers'. Why the dirty clothing, no shoes, the down-right-prehistoic gear? Once again, it is a rebellion against the complexity of the war; what is it to be truly human, not just a product of machines and the electronic reality they live in. <BR>The fight sequences are far from boring; play this next to any other action film (save LOTR, of course) and these blow the other movies away. Incredibly rich, very rewarding. You can see how much effort they placed into these scenes. Kudos to the choreographer(s). Great job.<BR>If I do have one complaint, it's the sequencing of the movie. Too much drama and story early on; way too much action later. But upon further examinaton- how else could they do it? They had to show Zion first; the love sequences; the humanity behind the Matrix. All of this leads up to the mind-boggling scene with the Architect.<BR>That was one breath-taking scene. <BR>That one scene changed the entire story of the Matrix- everything we thought was real turned out to be fiction in the original 1999 Matrix. Now, everything we thought was free turns out to be slavery once again. <BR>Fantastic. These films will go down in history; not just for the technical aspects, but the sheer philosophical complexity.<BR>Great stuff.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's first CD, Hybrid Theory, sold 13 million copies the year it came out, making it the best-selling CD of the year. This occured for a good reason: Almost every track on this CD is mindblowing. Attempting to be as critical as possible, which is very difficult at times, here is an overview of the tracks:<BR>1)Papercut: When I think of Linkin Park, I think of this song. Inspiring lyrics, nice instrumentals, and great balance throughout. A good song for the first track because it introduces the basic themes behind the band's music. 8.5/10<BR>2)One Step Closer: My third favorite song on the CD, a lot of people think of this because of Chester screaming &quot;Shut up when I'm talking to you!' But the rest of the song is sadly forgotten, which should not be as this song is excellent. 9/10<BR>3)With You: Somewhat underdeveloped, doesn't really grab me as much as the other songs, but tends to calm me down after the first two songs. 6.5/10<BR>4)Points of Authority: My favorite song on the CD(somewhat biased because of the excellent music video for this from &quot;Reanimation&quot;). A bit repetitive, but doesn't matter because the lyrics are so great, and so DEEP. All thes songs have deeper meanings. 10/10<BR>5)Crawling: Overplayed on the radio, a bit too slow for my tastes. Too generic. Although in this case generic is not a bad thing, this song doesn't have its own flavor. 7/10<BR>6)Runaway: The verses make this song more than the actual chorus, which is also good. Beginning to gear up for &quot;In The End&quot;. 7.5/10<BR>7)By Myself: Chester's best song in my opinion, the vocal range in this piece is amazing. I'm taken by surprise even though I know all the words. The emotional high point, and my second favorite. 9.5/10<BR>8)In The End: I guarantee you've heard this before...which is the problem. Very melodic, very creative, but overplayed, and it loses a point for that. 9/10 <BR>9)Place For My Head: After all the other songs ealier on the CD, this one sort ofdisappears. It just isn't particularly special, and nothing really impresses. Still solid though. 6.5/10<BR>10)From The Inside: Everything is this song is great. Unfortunately, the pieces don't always seem to fit, which somehow is not really aproblem. This song just sounds great. 8.5/10<BR>11)Cure For The Itch: Hahn is a great DJ, and this shows it. Better than Session on &quot;Meteora&quot;. 8/10<BR>12)Pushing Me Away: I know this has been said before, but why is this at the end of the CD? It's a hidden gem that makes me wish the CD just kept on going and going. The diamond in the rough. 8.75/10<BR>This CD is the beginner version of Linkin Park: Not as experimental as Meteora, but somewhat more focused. Absolutely mindblowing

B00000FCBC|4.0|Released just 5 years ago, 1998's &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;, was a return-to-roots album for the boys of Metallica. James, Lars, Kirk, &amp; Jason, decided to re-visit their roots, by covering classic tracks by some of their favorite bands. Disc 1, which was recorded entirely in 1998, features the singles &quot;Turn the Page (Bob Seger)&quot;, &quot;Whiskey in the Jar (Thin Lizzy)&quot;, &amp; &quot;Die, Die My Darling (The Misfits/Danzig).&quot; These new remakes are very entertaining, and sound better and more heavier than the originals. You also get a cover of, &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;, from Black Sabbath's 1973 LP &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; on disc 1.<BR>  Disc 2, is shock full of old, vintage Metallica, from 1984, 1987, 1988, and the early 1990's. This disc completely blows the first disc away, and is of much interest to dedicated fans. The first 5 tracks are the remastered &quot;Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; tracks from 1987, which are Jason Newsted's first ever studio recordings with Metallica. &quot;Helpless (Diamond Head)&quot;<BR>&quot;Last Caress (The Misfits)&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Wait (Holocaust)&quot; are among the highlights of that EP. Following this 1987 EP, are some tracks recorded in 1984 (with Cliff Burton on bass), b-sides to singles from &quot;...And Justice for All (1988)&quot;, and a cover of Queen's &quot;Stone Cold Crazy (1990).&quot; The last few tracks on this disc, are covers of Motorhead classics, that were recorded in 1995, prior to the release of the controversial &quot;Load (1996)&quot; album. I suggest you get this double CD set used, and avoid the <BR>&quot;WAL-MART version&quot;, which I accidentally bought back in 1998. This version beeps out all swears, which can get really annoying at times. Luckily, I re-bought this album in 1999, when it was on sale.
B0000508U6|2.0|Its unfair that people only rate the albums they love and every single album has 4.5 stars at least. I'm making an conscious effort to review some albums I don't like an I absolutly hate this one. The first 2 songs are good, the rest is terrible, period. Hey, at least thats more than Travis can say.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I caught the Greendale tour in Houston and, like many, was disappointed to find that Neil and the Horse were playing Greendale and not a greatest hits list.  A few songs into the set I realized that I was hearing pure gold - more of Neil's genius at work.  By the time Be The Rain rolled around I was up dancing in the ailes with everyone else.  The encores seemed pale in comparison even though they played many of the songs that I came to hear.  Greendale the show was awesome.  Greendale the disc is awesome too.  The guitar work on songs like Carmichael and Sun Green is some of Neil's best in years.  The whole disc works, and works well.  If you're a fan of Neil's or the Horse, this is some their best work ever.  Five stars easy.

185984054X|5.0|It takes courage to write about something, or someone, that is popularly believed to be beyond reproach.  Hitchens has done exactly this in his examination of Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity.  The book informs the reader concerning the inconsistencies surrounding Mother Teresa's ideals and the way in which those ideals were actualized.<BR>I came away from the book repulsed by the dichotomy between Mother Teresa's &quot;theory and practice,&quot; but conversely I am willing to concede that she was most probably a victim of the Catholic Church's imperative of saintliness at all costs.  It's quite regrettable and the book clearly shows how this can lead not only Mother Teresa, but any of us, to a point where objectivity is replaced by a sort of illogical religious fervor that blurs boundries and hinders clarity.<BR>Mother Teresa no doubt was a good person trying to put balance into an unbalanced world.  But after reading this book the reader is left with a sense of just how much her own modes of operation and thought were off-balance......
B000002H6C|4.0|This 1988 album is easily Metallica's last masterpiece. Released just 3 years prior to &quot;The Black Album&quot;, and 2 1/2 years after &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, it is the album that introduced the world to the &quot;new&quot; Metallica. &quot;One (track 4)&quot; became their first ever single release and music video on MTV. The &quot;Damaged Justice&quot; Tour in 1989, also helpled this album sell with the public. The production is very guitar/drums oriented, but James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, took most of the production credits for the Metallica albums released in the 1980's. If you are already famililiar with the song &quot;One&quot;, you should also check out &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, 'Eye of the Beholder&quot;, and the last track &quot;Dyers Eve.&quot; This was Jason Newsted's first full-length effort with the gang, and is probably the last great Metallica album, before &quot;The Black Album&quot; mania of 1991, 1992, &amp; 1993. I suggest you get it used for half the price, or wait until Metallica releases a Greatest Hits package, to get &quot;One&quot; &amp; &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; on 1 disc.
B000063DFQ|3.0|I had very high expectations for this album after hearing so much about it and being so impressed by Powerslave, and then after hearing The Trooper from a friend, I was convinced that this would be the best album ever.  However, I was quite wrong.  Many of the songs are too plain and lacking, some too slow, some just all-out boring.  However, there are some good spots on this album...<br />1. Where Eagles Dare: A great intro, but can't quite match up to Aces High.  Still a good, with a superb verse, but the whole song seems too similar.<BR>Rating: B+<br />2. Revelations: One of my least favorite Iron Maiden songs, and the beginning is well, uh, it shows promises, but yet not.  Then the verse begins, and ugh, too slow and such.  The rest of song is just too bright and happy.<BR>Rating: C-<br />3. Flight of Icarus: This song will take a while to get used to, as the verse is too plain.  But, the great chorus makes up for that, along with some good solos and the longest note ever held by Bruce at the final chorus.  Awesome chorus.<BR>Rating: B<br />4. Die With Your Boots: Kicks off with a bang on the intro, and then a speedy bassline comes in to assist the sweet riff.  The song is overall good, a solid song, and the chorus is great too, but the pre-chorus can get a bit annoying.<BR>Rating: B+<br />5. The Trooper: This is by far the best song on the album, and quite possibly the best Iron Maiden song ever. Just, wow.  The intro is superb and provides a great predecing to one of the best riffs ever.  It is so genious, I just can't describe it.  The verse is great and very fast and displays the perfect message.  This COULD have been my favorite song had Maiden just used the &quot;Ooohhh&quot; part as a break in the verse or pre-chorus, and threw in a good chorus.  Unfortuantely, I can only imagine.  Still an awesome song though.<BR>Rating: A+<br />6. Still Life: Well, three good songs in a row.  I just love the beginning, and well, the whole song too.  The verse is the highlight with Bruce's eerie voice in this song providing a good setting for a good song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />7. Quest For Fire: Now the album begins to decline.  The song is just WAY too plain and pointless, along with the horrid chorus.  Definitely not a very good song.<BR>Rating: C<br />8. Sun and Steel: Better than Quest for Fire, but just way too similar to &quot;quest&quot; in the verse, with the similar style.  Come on, something different or something good!<BR>Rating: C+<br />9. To Tame A Lad: The second in the Maiden epic songs, and maybe the worst one of the 80s, but still a good song, especially the long, yet very heavy part towards the middle.  But I just can't seem to get into the rest song as much.<BR>Rating: B<br />I wouldn't reccomend starting with this album, as that belongs to Number of the Beast, either that or Somewhere In Time, one of those.
079213690X|2.0|Christ knows how Mel Gibson was able to get away with playing William Wallace, much less garner an Oscar for this movie.  Gibson couldn't even hold Wallace's sword.  This has to be one of the most ridiculous attempts to take on Scottish history in Hollywood.  It made Rob Roy look good by comparison.<br />The battle scenes look like rugby scrums, with kelt raising reducing them to parodies of the actual battles that took place. If this had been a Monty Python sketch, I would have laughed heartily throughout, but it seems Gibson was dead serious in this bloated revisionist account of Wallace's ascendency to Braveheart.<br />I can understand how a movie like this would have fooled the general market, but is the Academy really that undiscerning? Do they have to give an Oscar to anyone who tries to make an historical epic?  It is a real mystery to me how Mel could have hoodwinked both the general public and the Academy on this one, but then it seems Scottish history is little more than fodder for Hollywood's less than fertile imagination.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It is very difficult to express by words what I feel<BR>when I am listening to this album.

B00004HYLF|5.0|When I was young, I found this tape in a box in my house and started to listen. It didn't work. It made the most ear-piercing sound I've ever heard a tape make. But through all that, I heard the music and immediately had my parents get me a copy. I was so young at the time that I knew nothing of &quot;popular&quot; music or any of the politics involved, so it became just me and the music. No knowledge of genres or fusion, just music. I loved it. This album has stayed with me throughout my life. I listen to it frequently, along with Yes, and ELP, and Gentle Giant. This one album has shown the most talent, dedication, creativity, and overall melodic genius that I've ever heard in my life. Nothing has touched me the way this album has, and I doubt anything ever will. A must have for fusion fans, musicians, and everybody else too.

0446310786|4.0|Set in the small, sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama during the time of America's Great Depression, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird tells of people's perspective into racism. Through the eye of Scout Finch, the young narrator, Harper Lee described the situation of Maycomb and its people, especially the ones closest to Scout, her father Atticus, and brother Jem.<BR>  Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl, is being defended by Atticus who is a lawyer. Tom Robinson symbolizes one of the mockingbirds of the story, an innocense looked down upon because of his race. Boo Radley, a metally retarded neighbor is constantly pestered by Scout and her brother because of their childish curiousity. They did not understand, however, that they were treating Boo with disrespect because of his differences. <BR>  The story goes on to describe the prejudice and racism that lives on depsite the bold kindness of the protagonist, Atticus Finch. Atticus told Scout that it is inside the court &quot;All men are created equal.&quot; But outside on the street, people are not equal because of their differences. To Kill a Mockingbird symbolizes the attack on innocense because of their differences. You don't kill a mockingbird, because it does no sin.
0671027344|5.0|OK, so there are a lot of people on here who did not like this book.  I guess I can see their point of view, but try mine. This is one of the first books I have ever read that was written for teens, but was not sugar-coated and dumbed-down to a 'highschool level'.  Chbosky writes as most highschoolers I know would.  He doesn't pull any punches with the language or the subject matter.<br />Some people on here have said that they can't relate to the situations Charlie gets into.  Well, I hate to break it to you, but for a lot of kids, that's what highschool is like.  Although I have not been through all of the same situations as Charlie, I have been through many of them, and Chbosky relates them perfectly. Reading this book, some of the passages seemed to almost flow out of my own memory.<br />After reading this book I felt very content.  Chbosky was able to make me care about the characters.  For the first time in awhile, I was visibly affected by the struggles and triumphs of  a character in a book.<br />The device of writing the book as a series of letters was great.  I have read one other book written this way and both were excellent. Someone on here said that if the book is written as a series of letters, Charlie wouldn't have written in paragraphs or used quotes and proper punctuation.  I would like to say that all the letters I write are written this way.<br />Basically, I think you just have to let yourself enjoy this novel.  If you go in thinking that Charlie is just another dumb kid, don't bother.  Let yourself get inside his emotions and the emotions of those around him.<br />If you liked this book, I also suggest reading the classic (at least in my opinion) Jonathan Livingston Seagull.<br />It's kind of a coming of age story, but the main character is, well, a seagull.

B000009EAD|5.0|Unlike most metal fans, I entered the scene late (around 1998) when I discovered Metallica. My love for Metallica grew, but I began to worry that I would never find someone who could compare to them. Then my friend casually told me to try Iced Earth. He gave me Something Wicked This Way Comes and Burnt Offerings. And the world of underground metal was opened up. <br />I now own nearly every IE album, and can honestly say that this is the best one. Their sound ranges from classic Iced Earth to old school Metallica, with some Blind Guardian and Iron Maiden spice thrown in, all mixed in with an increadible new IE sound that will impress all. <br />Absolutely everyone can find something to like in this album. If you like it raw and in-your-face, Burning Times and Stand Alone will appeal to you most. If you're like me and prefer a bit more melody, most of the other songs will turn you on like you wouldnt believe. Even my mom likes some of the songs on this album. The only song I can say I don't really like is Deciples of the Lie. It is one of only two IE songs that fall into that catagory. Dispite that, however, the album as a whole is absolutely increadible.<br />Here are the highlites of this album (there are a lot of them)<br />Melancholy (Holy Martyr) is the song that initially got me hooked on Iced Earth, and it remains in my top five list of IE songs. It has an increadible chorus and a melody that refuses to leave your head. <br />Watching Over Me, a song generally labeled as a ballad, has a similarly increadible melody. Personally, I'm not sure I could classify it fully as a ballad, for it is still distinctly metal music, and above all, Iced Earth. <br />1776 is a true hard rock instrumental, something that has not been done since Metallica's To Live Is To Die. It is all too short, but undeniably powerful. You will not tire of it. If you other young'uns out there havnt heard a good instrumental, try this one. It will change the way you look at rock.<br />Blessed Are You has the feel of Watching Over Me with a bit faster pace and even catchier chorus. I can say little other than listen to it. You will see what I mean.<br />The Something Wicked Trilogy that wraps this album up is one of the greatest musical feats in history, if not the best. In my mind it should be taken first as a whole, which can be broken down into three movements. This is Iced Earth at its finest:<br />Prophecy: Perhaps the best single Iced Earth song to date, Prophecy starts off slow and melodic, forming the basis of the Something Wicked story. About half way through it shifts, in a way that only Iced Earth is capable of doing, to hard metal the way it was meant to be. Matt Barlow (the vocalist) is at his very best in this song. Words cannot describe the feeling this song will give you.<br />Birth of the Wicked: Harder and faster than Prophecy, Birth of the Wicked is an intoxicating song remeniscent of IE's third album, Burnt Offerings, with that distinct Something Wicked twist. <br />The Coming Curse: This song caps off the Something Wicked Trilogy, and does so perfectly. It opens with 90 seconds of calming piano solo that will give you chills every time you hear it, because you know what is coming. The piano silences and the guitar smacks you in the face. It is nine minutes of pure extacy.<br />Any one of these songs, with the exception of Deciples of the Lie, are worth buying the cd for. But throw them all together, and you have something that rivals the very best of Metallica. To this day I cannot decide if I like Metallica or Iced Earth better (and i'm talking about musically, not the napster debacle or any of that). Trust me, once you try Iced Earth, you'll wonder how you lived without them. I do not give out five stars lightly, but, dispite its shortfall in Deciples, this album deserves six stars.<br />And after you buy this album, try Burnt Offerings, The Dark Saga, and the rest. IE has some of the greatest guitar work ever. Also check out Blind Guardian and Metallica. Blind Guardian is more melodic and includes a more symphonic sound, that may surprise some 'hardcore' people out there. The music is distinctly different than IE, but still excellent. Jon Shaffer of IE also did a joint project with Hansi of BG called Demons and Wizards. You will find it throws the harmonies of BG into the forboding guitar work of IE to create an amazing sound. And if you're not wild about Metallica already, go back and listen with an open mind. Try to ignore any prejudices against the attitude of the band members and focus instead on the music, as music is intended, and you may find you like it. Even Load and Reload (though I won't make the same claim for St. Anger). Anyway, enough about them, for now, buy Something Wicked This Way Comes.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I am another long time Iron Maiden fan who was excited about the return of Bruce Dickinson to the band, and I instantly loved their first album together again Brave New World.  Then after waiting three years (lean of good metal) for their next studio album my expectations of Dance Of Death were high, however I must say that this album has not met my expectations.<br />Initially I didn't like DOD much at all and it took me a few listens to get into it, but after playing it quite a lot I did get into it and now I think it's not too bad.  I also think that there are some excellent tracks on it:<br />&quot;Paschendale&quot; is by far the best track.  It is a heavy epic and creates an atmosphere so you can imagine yourself there.  This is something that Maiden have done so successfully with their classic songs from the past, and this song will also become a classic.<br />&quot;Journeyman&quot; is another song that I like quite a lot, with an acoustic sound that Dickinson has always wanted the band to try.  It is a great album closer.<br />&quot;Montsegur&quot; has a heavy, intense pace with welcome aggression.<br />&quot;Dance Of Death&quot; and &quot;No More Lies&quot; are typical Steve Harris type songs in style and arrangement, with mellow and harder parts and timing changes.  I think both these songs are also among the albums best.<br />The rest of the album though for me is nothing special.  Whilst the remaining songs aren't too bad (some are quite good in parts) they just aren't memorable and do not come close to being anywhere near as good as the classic Maiden from the past.<br />I think the two worst songs are: &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and &quot;Age Of Innocence&quot;.<br />&quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; is a poor choice for a single and poor choice for an album opener.  The lyrics are real wishy-washy and whilst the music is ok the song just sounds a bit lame to me.  It is not up to the usual Maiden album opening style.  Wickerman sh#ts all over it in comparison.<br />&quot;Age Of Innocence&quot; is good in parts, those being the slow paced intro and finish and the faster bit in the middle. But the chorus also sounds lame on this one and the song just plods along for the main.  I reckon they would have been better leaving this song off the album and putting it on the single as a bonus track which would get more people to buy the single.<br />Maybe they have too many contributing to song writing these days and need to get back to the days of old when Dickinson, Smith and Harris wrote the tunes, with the odd contribution from Murray?<br /><br />Two more of my gripes about DOD are the production and the packaging.  The production lacks clarity and sounds a bit like you're listening to it from behind a closed door, which is quite surprising given their recent albums.  The packaging is pretty boring also compared to past Maiden albums.  The photos of the band mostly just show them sitting or standing in a house on the same couch in different poses - how bland!  Surely the photographer could have come up with some more inventive pics!  The cover does not impress me as much as other Maiden albums and the packaging in general has a very distinct lack of Eddie about it.  Where are the pictures of some devilish Eddie monstrosity that us fans have become accustomed too?<br />In general I don't think the album is too bad, it's just that it's not that great either.  It's an album that's almost there but not quite, song wise, production wise and packaging wise.<br />DOD reminds me of their album &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; for two reasons:<br />1) There are some great tracks, but some ordinary ones as well.<br />2) Whilst each Iron Maiden album has songs of varying styles on it, the overall sound of each album is the same. This is not the case with DOD.  Like FOTD the sound is all over the place.<br />My favorite Maiden albums are still 7th Son Of A 7th Son, Brave New World, Piece Of Mind, Powerslave, &amp; 666.<br />I certainly expected better from Iron Maiden this time, but Dance Of Death is still worth getting for all Maiden fans, especially for the song Paschendale.  I just hope that I don't have to wait three years for the next Iron Maiden album and they work a little harder on it.<br />Having said all this it is good that a band who can play and write good music are still attempting to do so, and can still produce a reasonable metal album.  Metallica and Queensryche should take note!tter from Iron Maiden this time, but Dance Of Death is still worth getting for all Maiden fans, especially for the song Paschendale.  I just hope that I don't have to wait three years for the next Iron Maiden album and they work a little harder on it.  <br />Having said all this it is good that a band who can play and write good music are still attempting to do so, and can still produce a reasonable metal album.  Metallica and Queensryche should take note!
B000099T2L|2.0|Ummm I dont think this CD is what all these people are making it out to be. I think she tried TOO hard to be different. The CD is growing on me but it still gets 2 stars.
B000063K2W|4.0|This is a wonderfully dated (though still very relevant) and thoroughly entertaining comedy from the genius George Cukor. Perfect Wife Norma Shearer's marriage hits the rocks when her less-than-perfect husband begins an affair with the sluttish shopgirl Joan Crawford. Her friends rally round her as she ignores, complains, divorces, and finally rediscovers her own self-worth. <br />The performances are wonderful. Shearer is winsome and emotional, Crawford is venomous and ambitious (though we don't see enough of her character), and Rosalind Russell steals the show as the scheming, manipulative and two-faced 'Friend' you'd like to hit with a bus. The dialogue is spectacular, comparable in places with Bette Davis in her magnificent opus 'All About Eve', and the ensemble cast of over 150 women hangs together beautifully.<br />The direction, too, is superior, and Cukor exacts almost superhuman expressions and angles from the 'Faces' - Crawford, Russell and, most of all, Shearer. The gowns, hats, gloves, shoes, furs and jewelery in 'The Women' play almost as important a part in the picture as the cast members themselves, and the 'glorious technicolour' fashion show is a gem.<br />Sadly, 'The Women' suffers from the same syndrome as all Stage-to-Screen movies do. In a theatre, with scene and time restrictions, the audience depends on dialogue and character interaction for entertainment. In movies, such restrictions don't exist, and 'The Women', like 'Cabaret', 'The Sound of Music' and 'Funny Girl' after it, suffers from a 30-minute or so period in the centre, where it unfortunately loses its momentum. However, the ending is wonderful, especially Crawford's line about Kennels, and for anybody, 'The Women' stands the test of time as an illustration of the awful and hilarious power of gossip.
0066620996|2.0|Jim Collins is trying to find the characteristics of what makes a good company a great company. His findings are supported by an extensive analysis of 1,435 companies for a period of 30 years. He uses a scientific approach to analyze his data and his results provide good information however, I have to disagree with the fundamental assumptions and definitions he used to present the idea. The Webster's dictionary defines great as \\"markedly superior in character or quality\\" and the same dictionary defines quality as \\"degree of excellence\\". The author's definition of great is only based on stock market returns to investors. The investors would probably agree with his definition of great because they want to maximize their returns but a company should not be evaluated only for the money it can produce. Abraham Lincoln summarized the idea for an institution to exist when he said, &quot;Determine that the things can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way.&quot; <br />Companies are created to make money but at the same time they should provide a contribution to our society. For this reason it is very difficult for me to categorize a company such as Philip Morris as a great company. The damage caused by tobacco products is a well known fact and the use of tobacco has been linked to lung cancer and many other diseases. This means that when Philip Morris is making lots of money, many people are causing serious damage to their health. <br />Wells Fargo is also listed as a great company. Reading today's news I found that Wells Fargo was close to loosing its mortgage license in the state of California for unfair lending practices the California Department of Corporations said occurred when 15,000 home owners were overcharged $38 million in fees. The bank claimed it had reimbursed the home owners and regretted the incident, but the state said it had to file a suit against the bank to force repayment. These type of practices could show money in the company's portfolio that was nor necessarily made using a model of excellence. Also ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) released a report charging the San Francisco-based lender with predatory lending practices. ACORN said that Wells Fargo Bank and its subsidiary, Wells Fargo Financial, which caters to sub-prime borrowers, engages in predatory lending practices in low income and minority neighborhoods. I don't think this is a characteristic of a great company. <br />I also found an article about another \\"great\\" company. An EPA statement released back in December of 2000 entitled, \\"U.S. REACHES ENVIRONMENTAL SETTLEMENT WITH STEEL MANUFACTURER NUCOR\\". The statement reads \\"Nucor Corporation Inc. will spend nearly $100 million to settle a environmental suit alleging that it failed to control the amount of pollution released from its steel factories in seven states, under an agreement reached today with the Justice Department and the EPA. This is the largest and most comprehensive environmental settlement ever with a steel manufacturer.\\" I consider that the performance of a company is important because companies are created to make money. However, when a company is going to be evaluated, like I mentioned before, the ability to make money should not be the only factor considered. When companies incur in illegal practices it is because it maximizes their returns and minimizes their expenses. This could help a company show impressive market performance without showing the real price that the consumer is paying.     <br />There are other mechanisms that evaluate the performance of a company using a broader approach. For example the Malcolm Baldrige Award given by the President of the United States to businesses-manufacturing and service, small and large-and to education and health care organizations that apply and are judged to be outstanding in seven areas: leadership, strategic planning, customer and market focus, information and analysis, human resource focus, processmanagement, and business results. It is interesting to mention that from 1990 to 1995 none of the companies identified by Jim Collins as great companies won the Baldridge Award.<br />In addition to disagreeing with the definition of \\"great\\", I think there are external factors that impact, in a negative or positive way, the performance of a company. These \\"business environment\\" factors that can not be controlled by companies, should be considered when analyzing the performance of a specific business. For example, after the terrorists attacks of the 11th of September significantly impact the travel industry. Airlines, hotels, car rental companies, restaurants and many others lost a significant part of their business. On the other hand companies selling chemical/biological attack protection were and probably are still making more money than before the attacks.<br />Many companies are highly dependent on their \\"business environment\\" to make money and the companies listed by Jim Collins are no exception. The headline of an article published last July reads, \\"Nucor's Profit Drops 86%\\". The reason for the drop according to the article are that the average cost of scrap metal per ton increased $25 from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003, and total energy costs increased around $4 per ton from the first half of 2002 to the first half of 2003. Also it says that the U.S. steel industry, suffering from rising health-care and pension costs, has seen more than 35 producers file for Chapter 11 since 1997. I also found an article from last July about Kimberly-Clark. The headline reads, \\"Profit Dips at Kimberly-Clark\\". The reason that the article provides for their profit slip is that pension expenses rose and energy and raw material costs increased, factors that Kimberly-Clark can not control. Companies need to be flexible in order to adapt to these changes but they can not control their business environment even if they have all the elements of a \\"great\\" company.<br />I think Jim Collins book is very useful for managers who want to understand what the characteristics of good management are. Also, I need to recognize that his approach to analyzing the data is very professional, however I think some people could look at this book as the model to follow for business success and they wont necessarily obtain the results they want just by duplicating the elements of Good to Great's \\"great\\" companies.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie is a perfect example of why sequels shouldn't be made.<BR>Nearly no story, laughably lame and predictable love story between people with no onscreen chemistry together. If only there had been maybe 20 more Mr Smiths.... it would have been blatantly farcical. I'd compare having to sit through this movie to having to sit through Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, but this experience might have been worse. The only way I'll watch the 3rd in this series is if it's the Matrix Reformatted.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I was expecting this movie to at least be OK, with all the hype and what not.  However, it was not.<br />The good: Willem Dafoe, the editor of The Bugle (forgot his name), and Dunst's legs.<br />The bad:  both the story and acting seemed extremely forced and cheesy, the special effects were laughably bad (which should be unacceptable for a movie with this high a budget), and the special effects were seemingly used JUST to be used and did not further the story or add to anything. <br />Overall, an extremely average movie.  I'm glad I rented this, as I'd be pretty PO'd to have put down $15 or more for it.
0812550706|5.0|I actually had to read Ender's Game my senior year in high school...it was definitely the best book I've ever had to read for school...and one of my top five books of all time.  Orson Scott Card is a master, and he's at his finest in Ender's Game.  The story of a child prodigy, Ender Wiggin is sent to a special military school for geniuses in the hopes that he -- and the others at Battle School -- can lead Earth's forces in defending the home planet against a pending alien invasion.  Ender is the best of the best...and it shows in his tactical thinking.  But those who run Battle School are constantly testing Ender above and beyond the other child geniuses at the school...and Ender may crack under the strain.  To find out what happens...read this book...it really is some of the best SciFi ever written.
B00005JM0B|3.0|Terminator 3 was an average film taken on its own. That is all it tries to be, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It is just another action film in an everlasting and ever-expanding pantheon of action films. The only saving grace is that it's a darned good action film. As a Terminator film, however, it falters quite miserably in carrying on the torch.<br />Just as the first sequel came years after the original, Terminator 3 comes about a dozen years after T2 (although it doesn't seem that long: it seems there's a new special edition DVD of that film every couple of months!). I guess I can't blame James Cameron for milking that cow as much as he can, nor can I blame him for refusing to helm this sequel. When you think about it, the minute that it was announced he wasn't going to make the movie, we should have known that it wouldn't be true to the first two: Terminator was Cameron's brainchild. Nevertheless, here it is.<br />The plot of the film is probably evident to anyone within several hundred meters of a television, radio, computer, bus stop, movie theater, etc. It is nearly a remake of Terminator 2 when you think about it: New machine comes back in time to kill future leader(s), old machine is sent back to save them. With such novelty it isn't a mystery as to how the plot seems to go nowhere amid incredible (and incredibly expensive) chase scenes. In all honesty, people who want a little introspection ought to look at the first two films, there isn't any here.<br />From a technical standpoint, the movie is a great success. With a budget in excess of $150 million, the film has sufficient resources for magnificent eye-candy. Car chases, explosions, robot effects, you name it, it is pulled off here with style and aplomb. The acting is also surprisingly decent. Arnold's last pre-political film has him back in the role that started him off. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are both good actors and help the film tremendously. Kristanna Loken is brilliant as the new 'Terminatrix,' showing no emotion at killing dozens of people.<br />The major problem with this film is this: Would it have been fitting for Saving Private Ryan to have been filmed as a straight-action film? Of course not. It had very important messages-just dumping them for the sake of killer battle sequences (no pun intended) would have been a waste. The same applies here. Although the Terminator series has always been a good action series (even the first: shoestring effects rock!), the action is the focus here instead of the ideas. The ideas not only take a back seat, they are pretty much swept under the rug. It has been said before, but I will say it again: the first two films were about making our own destiny, that the future is not set, as several characters have commented during the saga. However, here the message that the war of humanity against the machines is inevitable. This is about 180 degrees from the original philosophy. Instead of examining this or even trying to harmonize it with the original message (impossible, but they should have tried), they just plow along on the chase scenes. This movie has no real insight into present-day society, nor does it try to. Being as the action was in the first Terminator primarily to service to the story and now the converse is true, it is no wonder that Cameron opted out of his own creation.<br />In short, the movie was a Terminator film solely because the franchise is an entertainment juggernaut. The studio just wanted the name. They should have changed the names and actors in the film and just made it a non-franchised title. At the very least, it wouldn't have been referred to as a remake by me.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Like others, it took a number of times of listening before I appreciated it. At first nothing stuck out that much, except (5) Dance of Death. After listening to it for a week, a few times a day (because I love Iron Maiden!), I can honestly say that this album rocks!! Wherever I am at: working, in the 4Runner, at the gym ... this music shares it's energy with you. You can't help but to feel uplifted and adrenaline-rushed. <br />This album is not at all selfish in sharing it's energy with you. As others have said, the best so far are Paschendale and Dance of Death. Other blood-pumping tunes are Montsegur and Face in the Sand.
B00005LQ04|4.0|I was curious to watch a Dario Argento film for so long now since I've heard a great deal about him. It just so happens that the first film I got to see from him is Suspiria being considered one of his best.<BR>I must say the color and designs in the film is fantastic but it's not all that scary to be honest. The blood looks fake but fashionable. All in all a fair movie.<BR>This limited edition does include however the soundtrack to the film which is classic in my opinion and which is also the reason why I gave this a 4 stars instead of a 3 stars.
0812513509|5.0|Speaker for the Dead has made Orson Scott Card the first author ever to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in consecutive years...Card more than deserves the honor.  Due to the effects of relativity, Speaker for the Dead takes place 3,000 years after Ender's Game.  Speaker for the Dead's main plot device is the interaction between human colonists on the planet Lusitania and the planet's indigenous, sentient but primitive, species the Pequininos...more commonly referred to as the Piggies.  Card's depiction of the Piggies and the human colonists is equally deep...it doesn't take very long for the reader to develop strong emotional ties to the characters...in my view that's the mark of a great writer.  Of course, the book has to have a hook to keep the reader going...in this case it is that the Piggies harbor a very unusual secret that is, of course, not revealed until the end of the book.  But like it's predecessor (and indeed all Card books...at least the ones I've read...and I've read about half of the novels he's written) Speaker for the Dead does not rely so much on the plot hook to keep the readers going...but relies more on the incredibly strong character development of which Card seems to have a knack which no other author I've yet discovered has.
B00005B5L4|2.0|Rather than spend time surveying the merits of a grammy-winning, multiplatinum album that is generally considered the best work of all involved, I want to focus in this review on the presentation of Rumours in the DVD-Audio format.<br />Conceptually, the producers of this particular disc assembled a good package, including an audio-only \\"making of\\" section which features the backing tracks of each song with commentary from all five band members.  This is a great idea, and the comments are all generally worthwhile.  The menus are typically static but don't have lyrics for the songs, which other DVD-A discs have, so anyone wanting to read along as the song plays will have to refer to the booklet, which does have the lyrics.  I personally don't mind this, as the menu pages are each attractive photomontages and, well, because I listen to music with my eyes closed most of the time anyway (except when driving).<br />The high resolution Dolby surround, 5.1 and two channel stereo mixes are, of course, the main draw because the music is the reason we're here to begin with. Unfortunately, I can't effectively review the audio because I only have a regular DVD video player, not a DVD Audio player. The only mix accessible through a standard DVD player is the Dolby Surround mix, and it sounds DREADFUL when reduced to two channel stereo (I don't have a surround set-up).  I put the headphones on to listen this way and I thought I was going deaf in one ear.<br />(For those interested, generally positive reviews of the new mixes appear at highfidelityreview.com and audiorevolution.com.)<br />The only other DVD-Audio disc I own is Pet Sounds, which is formatted to allow access on either type of player (DVD-A or DVD-V), a wise decision by the producers of that disc which reflects their understanding that the majority of music consumers don't own the (still relatively expensive) hardware for DVD-Audio.  As it stands now, DVD-A is still a marginal audiophile format, despite the minorityof people who declare that it's the future of recorded music. (SACDs actually probably have a better shot at this title because you can play them in regular CD players, even if you can't access all the layers.)  The professed benefits of the higher resolution audio are also debatable and probably lost on most listeners, and it's my personal feeling that 5.1 mixes are better suited to home theatre than popular music (hence the reason I don't have a surround setup).  So for Warners to have released Rumours on DVD-A in such a way that the average consumer can't listen to even the improved stereo mix (or view the supplemental documentary or photo galleries) suggests either an overly-optimistic faith in the future of the format as a stand-alone entity or a complete ignorance to the marketplace.  Either way, a great deal of work has been done that can only be enjoyed by a small percentage of this album's fans.<br />The quick and dirty of all of this is: don't buy the Rumours DVD-A unless you have (or plan to buy) the proper player.  Since this recording is currently only available otherwise as a mediocre-sounding CD, if you want to hear a better-mixed, better mastered version of this album, you're out of luck.
B000002I2G|4.0|&quot;Who Scared You&quot; is one of the Door's best songs utilizing the &quot;brass and strings&quot; backup found only on their Soft Parade album. A memorable ode to getting high and &quot;warming it up right&quot; with the one you love, the song is playful and sensual, AND WAS LEFT OFF THE SOFT PARADE ALBUM!!! Why? (If you want a copy of this number, please pick up the Essential Rarities collection.)The fact that one of the best songs of the Soft Parade sessions never made it onto the album is only one of the flaws that plagued this project in planning and execution. Surely, there are some great numbers here, none more memorable than &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot;, which features some of singer Jim Morrison's finest wordplay backed by memorable keyboards from Ray Manzarek and great guitar work from Robby Krieger. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is similarly hypnotic and mystical, featuring a great beat from drummer John Densmore, while &quot;Touch Me&quot; shows that, in the right context, the band could work well with brass and strings and features Morrison at his most romantic. &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; is a good, not great, ode to the infamous Miami concert, &quot;Easy Ride&quot; features the fantasy-driven lyrics of yet another lovemaking session, and the title track throbs and pulsates with tribal intensity. Lowpoints of the album include &quot;Do It&quot;, which is memorable only in that the other members seem more preoccupied with making Morrison laugh than making music; and &quot;Runnin' Blue,&quot; a tribute to Otis Redding with a country hoedown break! (Yes, you read that correctly!)For their next album, Morrison Hotel, the band abandones the strings and horns and returns to seminal rock and roll. This album has much to recommend it, particularly for diehard fans. It's a pity the band and/or record company was too scared to put one of the best songs on the finished album.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|David Bowie is a great singer and is hipper than other geezers like Bob Dylan and Neil Young.  This is a great album of cool tunes.  Bowie isn't as good as Justin Timberlake, but this record ain't bad for someone his age.  Check it out!
B000001EAQ|2.0|I was given a loan of this album and I have to say only four tracks are in any way decent. The rest is just substandard dross that outstays it's welcome. It's only a shame they went ultra safe with ATYCLB because that was even worse - like listening to the rest of this album only worse. When will Bono retire that's what I want to know
0790733226|4.0|Adapted with the help of famous astronomer Carl Sagan from his book of the same title, CONTACT brilliantly brings to life the fictional story of astro-physicist Ellie Arroway (Foster) whose passion for the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence is matched only by her resoursefulness. She is instilled with a sense of wonder about the universe by her adoring father, a widower raising her alone until his untimely death when Ellie is only 9. She finds no comfort in the words of the minister who advises that she must accept his death as God's will. As an adult, she chooses to eschew religion and devotes her energies to the pursuit of science. When she meets and is attracted to Palmer Joss (McConaughey), a religious scholar, there is a clash over issues of faith.<BR>     The plot revolves around  contact with an intelligent civilization many light years away that transmits blueprints for a machine of unknown purpose. But the strength of the story is the very well developed central character and Jody Foster's emotional portrayal of her (and Jena Malone does a wonderful job as the young Ellie). The story's lofty contemplations on faith vs. science and the implications for our planet of the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence lift this film above most other sci-fi. It also contains one of my favorite examples of imaginative cinematography. In a scene in which 9 yr. old Ellie discovers her father unconscious on the 1st floor, she races upstairs to get his medicine from the bathroom. In one continuous shot the camera tracks just ahead of and looking back at Ellie, from the 1st floor, up the stairs, turns down a hallway and into the bathroom. When she reaches for the medicine cabinet, you see that you have been looking into the reflection of the cabinet mirror the whole time. But of course, there is no way you could literally see Ellie's reflection in that mirror from the start of the shot, which began at the bottom of the stairs.

B000062YAZ|5.0|This is it. This is Reign in Blood. This is the album that did not start metal, but it sure as hell took it up a notch... wait... it took it up about 10 notches. This album set new standards for metal albums. This album has never been topped or even matched. If anyone knows, on the episode of Geraldo back in 198?, &quot;Kids Who Kill,&quot; they all listed Slayer as one of their favorite bands. Well... blah. Who cares. That was then, this is now. But anyway, here's the song list.<br />Angel of Death-The infamous opener, this song is about the horrors commited at Auschwitz by Josef Mengele. Anyway, the riffs, drums and vocals in this song are just plain... spectacular. I know you soccor moms think this is evil, it isn't. It's called MUSIC. 10/10<br />Piece By Piece-&quot;The only way to exit is going piece by piece!&quot; A great addition to the album. 10/10<br />Necrophobic-The fastest song Slayer has ever done. It's short, it's fast, it's awesome. 10/10<br />Altar of Sacrifice-A great song,  the riffs are VERY, VERY catchy, you'll be humming them all day. 10/10<br />Jesus Saves-God/religion bashing piece of brutal, rage-filled thrash. 10/10<br />Criminally Insane-Great drumming/guitar riffs. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are very talented and so are Dave Lombardo and Tom Araya. 10/10<br />Reborn-The 2nd fastest song on the album. Not as fast as Necrophobic, but still going at 1000mph. 10/10<br />Epidemic-Great song. Sounds like Ghosts of War from South of Heaven going faster. 10/10<br />Postmortem-GREAT HOOK!And I though Angel of Death was a catchy song! 10/10<br />Raining Blood-Remember how I said this was the best album EVER in the history of music? Well... it's natural for the best song to be on the best album, right? THIS IS IT!!! I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!!!! I HAD MY WALKMAN ON REPEAT THE OTHER DAY! I MUST'VE PLAYED THIS SONG 1,000 TIMES IN ONE DAY!!! THE BEST SLAYER SONG EVER! THE BEST SONG EVER! NOW I SHALL REIGN IN BLOOD! 100/10<br />Aggressive Perfector-A nice, fast song. 10/10<br />Criminally Insane-A great update of a great song. 10/10<br />Well... that's pretty much all. <br />And I just wanted to say that Metallica is great too, and they may be the masters of puppets, but forget puppets. When it comes to metal... SLAYER REIGNS IN BLOOD!
B000089RVR|5.0|Her new CD, &quot;Life for rent&quot; is one of the best CD's I have ever bought. If you don't have it yet, it's about time!
B000002NBY|5.0|As you can see from everyone, this is a five star album. Not like much at the time of it's release, or since. This is such a quality record, I liken it to &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; in the way that musically it's phenomenal, but it's also very emotional, and really an expeirience to listen to. The song &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; was the hit and video (with Chevy Chase), but I feel is one of the lesser songs on here. I applaude &quot;Paul Simon&quot; for making this album. It really is his masterpiece, and I've played it almost monthly on either vinyl, cassette, or cd. There's something about listening to this album on the way to Memphis Tennessee that I'll never forget.
B000007NYS|5.0|I moved away from Texas and am staying alive by listening to this, and eating chipotle salsa... <BR>Really, though. Lucinda is simply amazing. Her voice is so rich and twangy- always revealing more than the words. Her lyrics are provocative or plaintive or poetic- usually all three.<BR>Ah just buy this! You'll be so glad you did.
B000001DVV|3.0|These guys may have looked like &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot; or &quot;Faith No More&quot;, but they sound more like &quot;Motley Crue&quot; or &quot;Poison&quot;. Not that that's bad, I like them all. This pretty much consists of the huge hit &quot;Everything About You&quot;, the cover &quot;Cat's in the Cradle&quot;, and minor hit &quot;Neighbor&quot;. The rest isn't bad, just the typical fun hard rock/hair metal of the time. This may not be essential, but it is fun to rock the air guitar to &quot;Everything About You&quot;. Get it used.
B0000648WZ|1.0|OK.  Movies are a director's medium, and occasionally you find a forgettable book turned into a worthwhile film.  But there are even more wonderful stories butchered into horrible movies.<br />Paul Verhoeven's treatment of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers is such a case.<br />If he wanted to make a campy, overblown, anti-military statement of a film, he should have had the courtesy not to pretend it bore any resemblance to an award-winning story from a respected author like Robert Heinlein.<br />I will grant that there are portions of the film that are worthwhile.  Some of the special effects are very good (not the bugs, however), and some of the actors are quite attractive, especially when less than fully clothed, and, OK, the good guys appear to win in the end.<br />But Verhoeven apparently doesn't understand science fiction in the slightest.  Armageddon or Godzilla are not remotely genuine science fiction, but Plato's Republic -- an example of early fiction set in alternative times or places to avoid directly criticizing the status quo in his own society -- perhaps was.<br />In Starship Troopers, Heinlein presented an alternative form of government where voting and political leadership were limited to those who have first risked their own lives _protecting_ the nation.  In today's world, where most eligible voters are too apathetic to participate at all, and those who do vote aren't capable of rationally exercising their franchise, such a story is a reasonable manner of causing readers to confront the problem for themselves.  Verhoeven, however, belittles Heinlein's respect for military service by turning Heinlein's vision into a campy Nazi lookalike.<br />The film's other failings are too numerous to mention here, but include aliens killed by only a few rounds in one instance yet surviving hundreds of rounds from dozens of soldiers when in battle.  There are also numerous troop movements that would get a totally inexperienced 2nd lieutenant cashiered for notlistening to his senior non-coms.<br />I'm sure that producers wouldn't have been able to raise the money to produce a flick based directly on Heinlein's story -- lots of special effects, shooting, blood, and [more] would be necessary -- but what emerged under Verhoeven's direction was simply a travesty.
B000021Y77|5.0|I have always tried very hard not to say a movie was awesome, but I feel compelled to say that this German gem from 1999 is as awesome as awesome can be.  I've never seen anything like Run, Lola, Run; it's a film that doesn't sound as if it should really work, yet its presentation is dazzling and mesmerizing.  Franka Potente gives an incredible performance, her talents as visible as her bright pink hair.  There's nothing misleading about the title.  Lola runs and runs some more; Franka Potente could probably have tried out for the German Olympic team after all the running she had to do here.<br />The strengths of this movie are its unique vision, stunning cinematography, and pulse-pounding soundtrack, but here's a breakdown of the plot.  Lola (Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) are in love, and like most couples in love we find the man doing something really stupid and blaming the woman.  Manni does a little work for a mafia-type fellow, and his latest job involves the delivery of one hundred thousand marks to his boss.  Lola was supposed to meet him in town, but she was late, and Manni ended up accidentally (yet still very stupidly) leaving his bag o' cash on a train for a bum to pick up and run off with.  Now he has twenty minutes to come up with one hundred thousand marks before having to face Mr. Big.  Lola was late because her bike was stolen, yet of course the whole mess is her fault, according to Manni.  I'll cut the guy some slack here, though; knowing you are about to be rubbed out tends to put a little stress on the system.  Lola takes off, trying to come up with the money and get it to Manni before the top of the hour.  Lest you think the film cannot last longer than thirty minutes tops, just know that there is something a little bit different about Lola; the old saw &quot;if you don't succeed, try, try again&quot; takes on special meaning with this girl, and the transitions of what might be considered silly by some are handled very, very well.<br />Run, Lola, Run does much to show us how our decisions impact both ourselves and those around us, even strangers, in a big, big way.  The movie provides us with a quick series of revealing snapshots of the future lives of several individuals who cross Lola's path, and it is really quite fascinating to see how these peeks at the future differ under slightly different circumstances.  One may not be able to say that fate is kind or unkind, but she (fate) is certainly capricious.  Irony abounds here, just as in life.  The visual presentation of this film is just stunning, combining all sorts of illustrative elements.  There is an animation sequence that mimics part of Lola's run, split screen shots of two scenes at once, and almost dizzying camera pans that do indeed compare with a lot of the elements of music videos.  The whole movie is also infused with a powerful, beating soundtrack (a significant portion of which is provided by Franka Potente herself) that never allows the viewer to take a breath; there is very little danger of your nodding off while watching this cinematic masterpiece.  Voted the best film by the audience at the Sundance Film Festival of 1999, Run, Lola, Run is a visionary piece of cinematic art that every lover of good movies should see.Run, Lola, Run does much to show us how our decisions impact both ourselves and those around us, even strangers, in a big, big way.

0671004107|5.0|I hesitate to give 5 stars as it seems to suggest perfection.  My 5 stars are to indicate my overwhelming satisfaction with Sagan's book.  It ties in the following areas neatly into one sci-fi genre book: physics theories and findings, social science, political science, human behavior, and religion.  Now, anyone who can put these categories together in one book is pretty good, anyone who does it seamless is great, anyone who does it seamlessly and keeps you entertained and has a clear point is great - Carl Sagan was great.<br />First of all, this is a sci-fi book.  What differs this from thousands of others is that everything physics related in Contact is either a proven or a proposed theory.  Sagan is a phycist by practice.  <br />Secondly, Sagan humanizes the plot line.  You are confronted not just a bunch of science jargon or some romantic story but rather a combination of the two which allows both an everyday reader and an astronomy enthusiast enjoy the book equally.<br />Thirdly, it incorporates our current world beatifully.  It is rather mind boggling to think about the kind of research that Sagan had to do in order to write this book.  He wrote about many different cultures and fairly protrayed each.  Sagan also did a great job portraying power play within and among the governemnts<br />Finally, Sagan remembered his audience and never forgot to be entertaining and ever so gripping.<br />Just as a personal note, for a physicist Sagan writes elegantly and descriptively - a rare gem really.<br />Have fun with the book.
B0000640VO|5.0|While not necessarily for underage viewers, Amelie is a fun and sort of twisted refreshing type of film.  It is in French with English subtitles, but I hardly noticed because it is such a great film.  It's cute and Amelie' is a do-gooder who has a nice openness to her while still remaining mysterious to the people she does good for.  It's one of my favorite movies.

B000069AUI|5.0|coldplay is totaly my favorite band. And this is the best album that they have come out with even though its the 2nd i love every song on it. buy it
B0000AXE8I|2.0|First off, I will probably buy this dvd just to watch the car chase in slow motion.  I like special effects for special effects sake, and these are as good as they come.  The Smiths v. Neo wasn't as impressive, but is still good to study if you are into these things.<br />On the other hand, the supposed depth of the movie's plot doesn't hold up under scrutiny.  It seems as though the writers have read a bunch of cliff notes and decided to impress the public at large with their intelligence.  But they end up taking shortcuts, using buzzwords and solemn tones instead actual reason and insight.  To take it back to the Allegory of the Cave, people are confusing this series for a great, insightful epic, when it is really just a shadow of such a thing.  If you want deep sci-fi, stick to 2001.  <br />Whatever, though, it is entertaining, if annoyingly self-impressed.  I would give it 3 stars except I felt the need to counteract the overexuberance of some of the others.<br />One question though- if humans can run a giant, underground city on presumably geo-thermic electricity, why can't the robots just do the same instead of sapping people for electricity?  It would simplify things greatly for the robots.
0312979479|4.0|And Then There Were None is a great book that grasps your mind and takes you on a trill ride as the story is read. It begins by giving a brief background of the characters.  Next they all come together by a weird invitation by someone whom they had suposedly met. They come to Indian Island with hopes of vacation and relaxation, but soon realize that things aren't as they seem. One by one they begin to die and the mystery unravels throwing you twists and turns that keep you on the edge.I highly recommend this book to you suspense readers out there. Enjoy!
B00004ZD69|5.0|All I can say is that I love this record and that I think it is one of the finest modern day instrumental albums i own.  I don't think they are as good as Tortoise probably, but the opening track on this record really has the potential to challenge my thoughts.  There are too many twists and turns on this record to tell you exactly how every song goes, but I think it is obvious that the best two tracks are the opener and the closer.  Storm is my idea of a perfect piece of music and the closer, which I think is called Antennas to Heaven, really doesn't seem all that special at first until the music kicks in and there is this weird squall of guitar and the whole band playing.  I don't even know if it is guitar I am just guessing, but all I know is that it is great.  All in all a great record from a great band that also does not disappoint live.
B00009RDG9|1.0|That's what they should have titled this movie. If you're going to redo the plot of a movie like First Blood, at least remember the plot part of it. How Del Toro extracts his &quot;friend of the animals&quot; mindset from Kosovo killing nightmares is never explained. Why hunters are out hunting Del Toro instead of Bambi is never explained. Why Ms. FBI is in shoot-first-question-later mode is never explained. Some mysterious mission is mentioned in the paddy-wagon right before Del Toro kills his captors but is never mentioned again.<br />The chase/tracking scenes, wilderness, and fights are neat but that's about it. The continuity leaves a little to be desired though. I mean, they're in the river, they're in some broken down mill-type building, all of a sudden Jones is in the woods again, he trips a miniscule wire and the twin tree-trunk crushing trap from Return of the Jedi is sprung. There was no scene of Del Toro or even the Ewoks that must have helped him lift the 500lb tree trunks into the air.<br />And then it ends. Thanks. I want my money back.
B000002KCC|5.0|This album is so perfect! How can you go wrong with an album as beautiful as this?  Truly one of his masterpieces and a record I am glad I purchased.  It's almost hard for me to listen to the title track since it can just move you so much emotionally with it's aching sadness.  I think every Neil Young fan already has this record but people that don't really know about Neil Young's music should probably start with After the Gold Rush or Harvest I guess due to the fact that they are a lot more accessible for people starting off.  Get this after those two and also get the new On The Beach re-issue.
B000059GEH|4.0|This movie is half a century old and followed The Robe as the second Cinemascope feature.  It's visually beautiful in the DVD widescreen version, evoking the thrill of first seeing Cinemascope in 1953 (which I'm old enough to remember).  Though the story and humor are extremely dated and so many of its stars are now dead, the photography and sound are both so breathtakingly clear and beautiful, it makes one realize how advanced the technical side of filmmaking was that long ago.  It's amazing how cinematographers of that day were able to adapt so quickly to the much wider screen and take full advantage of its sweep even during scenes filmed in close quarters, such as those on the airliner (which was a propeller plane, by the way). It's true that Lauren Bacall, though lovely in the film, looks much older than the &quot;25&quot; she's supposed to be.  (I saw Ms. Bacall in person pitching her bio at a bookstore 45 years later and she looked un-surgically young and beautiful, so go figure.) While the movie is not great in terms of content or performances, it's worthwhile because it's a beautifully restored piece of movie history that recaptures a more innocent (?) age and preserves an important part of the Monroe legend.
B000089RVR|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  Tracks &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; and &quot;See the Sun&quot; are my favorites and superb in every way.  Dido's voice is fantastic, the production is first rate, and the songs are great.  She's beautiful too!  Significantly better than &quot;No Angel&quot; which was damn good.  It is obvious that the four years since her first album were well spent.
0783240236|4.0|Although Alfred Hitchcock is widely regarded as the greatest director of suspense and \\"thriller\\" movies in Hollywood's long history, in his direction of \\"The Birds\\" (1963), he outdoes himself. Even more than \\"Psycho\\", which started the modern \\"slice-and-dice\\" genre of horror movies, \\"The Birds\\" is a truly disturbing and surreal experience - a nightmare which comes to life on film. In my opinion \\"The Birds\\" is unlike any other Hitchcock film - it actually comes closer to movies such as \\"The Sixth Sense\\" or even \\"The Matrix\\" in the way it takes the \\"real world\\" we are all familiar and comfortable with and turns it into a waking nightmare. The film's plot is deceptively simple: Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), a rich and rather spoiled young woman, meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), a handsome and rather mysterious man, in a pet store in San Francisco. She is intrigued enough to follow him to his home in Bodega Bay, a charming but isolated small fishing town on the northern California coast. There she meets the local schoolteacher, Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), who once had a brief affair with Mitch. Annie takes an  immediate dislike to Melanie and her interest in Annie's old boyfriend. Eventually Melanie meets Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy), a high-strung and suspicious woman who leans upon her son for emotional support and stability.<br /><br />However, this soap-opera style plotline is simply the background for the real story; in the beginning of the film we see ominous flocks of birds over San Francisco, which is a preview of what's to come. As the film progresses the birds in Bodega Bay and the surrounding countryside begin to act strangely - they suddenly attack humans for no apparent reason, and start gathering in large and disturbing groups on power lines and rooftops. Eventually the birds become murderous - they kill a local farmer by crashing through his bedroom window and hacking out his eyes. Then they attack the schoolchildren and townspeople in yet another of Hitchcock's famous film sequences. As the frightened and baffled townsfolk are hemmed into their homes and stores like \\"birds in a cage\\", they blame Melanie for bringing this terror into their once-peaceful little town. The film's famous climax occurs at the home of Mitch and his mother, as a massive flock of birds attacks the home at night and tries to get inside to kill our heroes.<br /><br />To make this film even more disturbing and bizarre, Hitchcock decided not to have a musical score, and there is no music whatsoever - only the terrifying screeching of the birds as they attack. What makes this film work is how Hitchcock deftly takes everyday, normal things - such as sitting on a park bench and smoking a cigarette, and turns it into something bizarre, surreal, and truly frightening. Although some critics have refused to label this film as one of Hitchcock's best, it does rank as one of the scariest thrillers of all time. Beware of \\"The Birds\\"! (But you'll love the movie).
B000007MVM|5.0|When I first listened to Syd Barrett's \\"The Madcap Laughs,\\" I was amazed by how different it sounded from his work on Pink Floyd's \\"Piper At the Gates of Dawn.\\" No psychedelic freakouts, no whimsical lyrics about gingerbread men or gnomes, and no production flourishes to speak of. In fact, this album is quite stark with its minimalist production and predominately acoustic atmosphere. Syd seems very much alone here. Based on other reviews I've read, people either love this album or hate it. For those who hate it, I guess I can understand why. \\"Terrapin,\\" despite being a great song, goes on for way too long without any real variation, Syd's vocals on \\"Dark Globe\\" and \\"If It's in You\\" are very warbly and even a little grating, and the guy's guitar skills aren't that great. In places he sounds like he is mentally falling apart (which he was). As for my personal opinion of this album, I LOVE it. Everything about this album to me is the epitomy of what makes a record great. Syd may not be able to play guitar like Jimmy Page, or even write coherent lyrics at times, but the atmosphere is so stark and intimate than I cannot help but love this album. Many songs here bring out emotions from me, and no matter what Syd is singing about, I really feel for him all the way through. Many people talk about Nirvana's Unplugged session being especially intimate, and it was, believe me, but \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" gives that album a real run for its money in that department. Despite his apparent madness, Syd displays a wide range in both the songwriting and the lyrical department. The verses in \\"Dark Globe\\" as well as the cheerfully kooky \\"Octopus\\" contain borderline schizophrenic lyrics. Don't bother to try and interpret these, Syd didn't always know what he was getting at, either. \\"No Good Trying\\" is a favorite song of mine. This song is one of the few on this album to contain backing tracks by the psychedelic/art-rock band the Soft Machine (who incidentally played with Pink Floyd duringtheir fall 1967 tour with Jimi Hendrix). The lyrics on \\"Here I Go\\" are really quite special; in this song Syd tells a story (a rather amusing one I might add) about being in a bad relationship, going over to his girlfriend's house only to be informed by her sister that the girl isn't home. Syd is invited in anyway, and before you know it, he's stepping out with his girlfriend's sister. Amusing and charming. \\"Golden Hair\\" borrows its lyrics from a James Joyce poem, which is accompanied by a simple, yet haunting acoustic guitar part. I really like this song and its dark atmosphere; in fact I learned the guitar part (which wasn't too hard) so I could work on a cover version of this song. \\"Dark Globe\\" is one of my favorite Barrett songs, but I have to admit that the version found on the outtakes collection \\"Opel\\" is far superior to the one here. However, the real highlight of this album is the closing track \\"Late Night.\\" This is probably one of the best songs Syd ever wrote and it's one of my favorites. Syd really holds it together here, his lyrics convey much imagery, and he sings them in a subdued, yet knowing way. The slide guitar overdubs really add to the quiet, psychedelic feel of this piece, and they also prove that Syd was still capable of the psychedelic slide work that he always used to great effect in his Pink Floyd days. <br />All in all, this is a must have. I can't imagine my life without this album now. Syd's music really touched and inspired me, and I think that he was not only a great songwriter, but also a beautiful person. This album may sound completely different than \\"Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\" on the surface, but no matter what style of music Syd plays (be it freak-out psychedelia or stripped-down acoustic pop-folk) he is still capable of producing the same charm and magic that he always has. Take a chance with this album, and I guarantee you that you will have found a new favorite.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson was given the, one might say, unenviable task of converting Tokien's literary epic into a mass-marketed Hollywood production, in a format both condensed changed in some content. It is perhaps the most difficult task to accomplish as a director - trying to portray an already much-loved and acclaimed book onscreen; Jackson, however, has done this with as much taste and ability as is possible.<BR>   First though, to briefly list the hardcore Tolkien woes: The Ents, the Elves at Helms Deep (ugh!), Eowyn chasing after Aragorn, Faramir being seduced by the ring, no Shelob...phew. Lastly, as amazing as Gollum looks now, in ten years the CGI will look awful and ruin the whole film. But enough of the bad...<BR>   The movie contains the most beautiful cimematography of this generation of film. The wide, Frank Capra-esque shots of rolling, snow covered mountains, forests, and grassy plains are simply beautiful. The arduous set construction pays off with locations that may as well exist in this world, as real as they look, particularly Theoden's Hall, where intricate stone and woodwork can be casually observed. <BR>   The score is not the best ever seen in film, but wonderful in its subtleties. It wraps around the picture like a blanket, scarely noticable at times due to its pure cohabitation with the movie. When it needs to, it takes on a descisive thunderous quality, in keeping with the massive scope of The Two Towers.<BR>   The cast of mostly B-list actors is excellent. Those that particularly shine are Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). Dourif is appaulingly haunting; his eyebowless countenance can be likened to a medieval Hannibal Lecter, preying on Eowyn's fears like a butcher-bird. Mortensen is massively confident, but without boasting; he takes the part and makes it his, with a classical maturity. Also noteable is Sean Astin's performance; his flawless rural English accent could so easily have nose-dived. Astin and Wood work toform a memorable onscreen chemisty, a classic good vs. evil struggle, relying on only each other.<BR>   Perhaps the most brilliant achievement of Jackson is his creation of a vast, spawling, visually stunning epic that still manages to be a study of character. George Lucas should take note; the horror that was Episode 1 could and should have been like this. The story oscillates gently on Jackson's cognitive ocean; moving from Elrond and Arwen's moving last conversation, to the tumultuous Helms Deep; from the haunting sadness of Gollum, to the Ents' destruction of Orthanc. Directors these days seem to get carried away with their computer-endowed deity status, but Jackson uses it only as a tool to realize Tolkien's vision.<BR>   The Two Towers is genius on film, poetry in motion. If those viewing it do not feel privileged, they are but fools, for they know not what they see. Buy this DVD and bask in its aura, put it on a plinth, and feel the radiating warmth. Buy it, buy it, buy it.
B00001OH7G|5.0|The first time I saw Rory Gallagher live he was a warmup act, and he stole the show from Deep Purple, no easy thing to do.  He was that good, blessed not only with technical skill but with a musical soul that shone through his music.  This 1974 live recording is a tribute to his fiery blues-rock guitar playing and the heart behind it.  I've been told by people who knew him that he was the nicest guy on earth, something that comes through in the video version of this recording available now on DVD, he was all music, no showbiz, a bluesman who seemed almost embarrassed when he became a rock star as well.  If you don't know his work, this live album is a good place to start, just be prepared to buy more once you get a taste.  The public has largely forgotten Rory just as they have Roy Buchannan, but guitarists will be impressed no end when you mention his name, they know how good he was and how much he loved the music.  Maybe that's why the Rolling Stones considered him as a replacement for Mick Taylor, but somehow I can't see Rory wearing leopardskin jackets and leather pants.  His life was too short, but at least we have this wonderful music to remember him by.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Since seeing &quot;The Lion King&quot; when it first came out in the theaters - I've been in love with it.  The story, the characters, the songs...I had goosebumps all the way through it.  This DVD brings back the memories and more.  All the extras, from the Safari to the &quot;Circle of Stars&quot; performing &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; are fun and will keep you busy for quite awhile.  The new song &quot;The Morning Report&quot; is seemlessly added to the film.  Two thumbs up for Disney for releasing this incredible edition of an already incredible film!
0385504209|5.0|If the purpose of reading fiction is to be entertained, then this book does this superbly.  Like most of the other readers, I couldn't put this book down and found myself staying up way past my bedtime to finish it.  I also agree with the comparisons to Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum.&quot;  Although, I think &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is infinitely more readable.  Eco writes Fiction like it is non-fiction and the reader can get bogged down in the all the details, distracting from the enjoyment.  I hate to say Brown is a dumbed down version of Eco, but I think that is the case.  And I applaud him for it.  I actually found the lack of character developement refreshing as I didn't want how they looked or whether they fell in love or not to get in the way of the story.  Admittedly, there are some big theoretical leaps in the way the history and facts are presented, but hey, it's fiction.  Try not to overanalyze it.
B000089RVX|1.0|So, I downloaded this crap of an album to make sure I wasnt going to wast 15 bucks on it, and Amen for me! This album is horrible, it should be used to treat insomnia--I was FALLEN asleep while listening to it. I guess after Avril Lavigne last year record companies felt the urge to find another crappy female singer who think she rocks because she wears dark eye liner and does signs with her hands. It's sad, cuase when I see this girl she's like a bad female version of Trent Reznor, and that, she should take as a freakin' complement. Also, why is she the only one on the damn cover? this is a band, not a solo artists. I can't wait til the egos collide and this band breaks up. Definetly a one hit wonder, and all because you people kept on buying the album and requesting the song on the radio. So played out!!
B000001FA4|4.0|This is an awfully good album.  Very nicely textured with Bono's vocals, Edge's guitar, and Adam Clayton's bass.  More acoustic and less angry than 'War' but not obviously radio friendly like 'The Joshua Tree'.  Being 20 years old, I think it has aged wonderfully well.
B000089RVR|5.0|I've purchased quite a few new albums lately and this is by far the best one.  There is a song for every mood in this CD.  Definitely a must buy!
B00006ADFL|3.0|Heavenly Creatures is a dark tale of two very disturbed young women, a showcase of their intense bond and their slow tip over the edge.  Together they create a fantasy world which soon outpaces their dull and often oppressive reality (New Zealand in the '50s).  Peter Jackson shows respect for their fantasies and handles their relationship with a surprising delicacy, all the while leading us down the dark path to evil:  a brutal murder in cold blood.  Kate Winslet provides a believable if somewhat smug interpretation; Melanie Lynskey's characterization is a bit one-sided; but they work well together.  Their relationship drives the movie, which regardless of your opinion of it will stick in your head for some time.
0792844882|4.0|Oh, I should get a dozen lashings for having watched this, what with only sixteen years under my hip-hugging jeans, but I thought I'd give it a chance. And I'm pretty pleased to say that I am glad that I did. <br />This movie won't change your life, but it will give you a couple laughs at the complete ridiculousness of some things - Nomi's tough-girl facade and her hilarious 'sexy' writhing during the 'hot' love scene, and the 'tension' between her and the lead Showgirl.<br />If you watch this movie without taking it seriously, you'll probably enjoy it. At least on a rainy day.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I prefer this version to the A&amp;E version for several reasons. In this version, Austin's original ideas come through much clearer. I thought the acting stayed much closer to the ideas in the book. Ehle and Firth's Elizabeth and Darcy are constantly sniping at each other. Garvie and Rintoul's Elizabeth and Darcy are both much colder initially - which make their real fights memorable, not just more of the same. You can see the increasing emotions between them as each argument actually breaks down a barrier between them. This version's Mrs Bennett is also not so overacted. One of the main purposes for adding the character of Lady Catherine was to show, though there were objections to Elizabeth's relatives, Darcy had a few ill-mannered and unfortunate family members himself. In the meeting between Mrs Bennett and Lady Catherine in the book, the whole idea was to show Mrs Bennett was actually less embarrassing than Lady Catherine. I also prefer the performance of this Lady Catherine. She is dignified and elegant, which makes the revelation she is nothing but a windbag more surprising. She is also constantly giving tips, pointers and commands. Her arrival at the Collins' house in horror because &quot;the butcher has just told me you have ordered a whole leg of lamb. A half will surely do this time of year&quot; is a delightful illustration of her meddling. Overall, this version shows events more gradually rather than beating the viewers over the head with who the characters are and what is happening. It's only disadvantage to the A&amp;E version is, because it is shorter, it has to leave out a few scenes. It does a good job of making it up, however, by staying focused where the A&amp;E version tends to wander a bit.
0688163173|5.0|Some other reviewer said they could have seen the ending to this one coming if they had just read more carefully and that the only reason they *didn't* see it coming is because it was such a &quot;quick read.&quot;  One of the marvels of Lehane's book is that even though the ending shocks you, once you get there you realize that it was there all along in plain sight.  However, the one thing the ending is NOT is predictable.  Besides, it's a quick read only because it grips you and doesn't let go!  I started reading Shutter Island one evening and stayed up until I finished it, well into the morning hours -- because I just couldn't put it down.  The ending hit me right in the gut. After (finally) turning out the light I lay there for another hour just thinking about it.  The next night I was up late again, looking back through it, tracking all the signs, and clues, and explanations, and still shaking my head, trying to digest it.<br />This book is a really great read.  This book is extraordinary!!  Somebody else said that it's not for the faint-hearted.  Probably not.  But if you want to read something with incredible power, what are you waiting for?!  THANK GOODNESS for Dennis Lehane and his powerful gift for writing.

B00006D295|5.0|Incredibly, I only just saw this movie about 10 years ago, after hearing about it for almost 20 years, and I was amazed at how well it stood up. The wacky blending of sci-fi, horror, blatent sex themes, and campy humor, (including some pretty kinky themes for the time) became one of the greatest cult movies of all time. Not far from me there was a theater that played the movie at midnight three nights a week, and this went on for years, but I never saw it during all that time.<br />Then there's the fact that the movie is actually a musical with some very catchy music--another thing I hadn't realized until I saw the flick--and again, I was surprised at how well the music had stood the test of time. Tim Curry is superb in the main role as Dr. Frank N. Furter, the brilliant mad scientist from an advanced civilization of cross-dressers, and the other performances are good as well. Meatloaf does a standup job blasting out his hit song on the sax in his scene. It's still a wonderfully entertaining movie after all these years, which is all the more amazing since when it was released initially it was a flop.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Donna Summer was that rare vocalist who managed to transcend the whole disco era, despite the fact that she was its' appointed &quot;queen&quot;(a title that's probably done more harm  than good).  And since it is the new millenium(well, three years into it), might as well throw out another Summer-lovin' compilation(no doubt trying to keep up with Cher in the greatest hits dept). Not that there's anything wrong with what's here--unlike many artists, Summer could be colored brilliant on more than one occasion(&quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, and &quot;Dim All The Lights&quot; to name just four).  And apparently she wants us to know she's alive and well, thus the two new tracks with old partner Giorgio Moroder, the both of them tasty little pop nuggets.  One suggestion--next time, let's throw in , I don't know, eight or nine addtional new tracks and leave off everything recorded before the year in which we're releasing  it. Wait--scratch that bit about the additional new tracks.  That would constitute...a new album?
0385512104|5.0|This was a wonderful book that I have been thinking about since I finished it last week.  A 15 year old autistic writes a mystery novel telling of how he plays detective to solve a mystery of a neighbor's poodle that he found killed.  I found it hard to beleive this was a fiction book.  I felt like I was in the head of an autistic child and what it must feel like.  The descriptions of &quot;seeing everything&quot; were wonderful.  A unique book written a  different perspective.  Highly recommended!
B00005U16N|5.0|BLOW, is a fantastic movie on all counts. Director Ted Demme who sadly passed away shortly after filming was completed painted a real and all too scary account of of a man who scored big and made millions as one of the biggest cocaine dealers in the 70's but like everthing that is illegal crashed and burned in a spectacular and sad way. BLOW, is the true story of George Jung who as a young boy watched as his parents fought over money and lived O.K. but nothing out of the ordinary. One day when his father lost his job and had to file for bankruptcy young George said to his father that he &quot;never wanted to be poor&quot; to which his father responded &quot;than you won't&quot;. Jung, wanted a lot of money and he wanted fast without going thru the trials and tribulations of getting a real &quot;decent&quot; job and settle for a less than ordinary life. This film is excellent but a little tough to watch especially as Jung's life and glitzly world of money and coke spirals out of control and worst of all gets turned over to the police by those he thought were his friends. Johnny Depp is the main reason to see this movie, here he gives his greatest performance yet and he is compelling as he is beliveable as Jung. You sometimes feel sorry for him, you know that he's done wrong but thru it all he is really not a bad guy just got caught up in a life that moves too fast and too dangerous. Depp, again will leave you spellbound and it proves that he is not just another pretty face by Hollywood standards but an intense and gifted actor who is also extremely versatile. This film is great and I highly recommended.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice...a great singer and song writer who demonstrates his unique talent through his words and music, which i truely believe takes today's music to a different level...this album blew my mind...i enjoy every single song on this album...before i went to see his concert...a friend told me that his concert is quite a spiritual experience...very hard to believe, isn't it?...what a concert and what a perfomance!!  His music is raw yet very powerful...this is definitely an album that everybody should own...it is a more than 5 star album...if you are already a damien rice fan...also check out his single albums...they are great too...
6300216543|5.0|SERPICO, is one of my favorite movies of all times. I love everything about this film especially Al Pacino who gives the performance of a lifetime. Pacino was so convinving as undercover cop Frank Serpico that it is scary. This film defined the way police corruption is looked upon in the eyes of everyday policemen and it also became one of the first films in the 1970's to explore the antihero in its most complex form. This movie was s smash hit at the box office in 1973, when it was release and it was nominated for I believe five Academy Awards including Best Picure of the year and the Best Actor for Al Pacino, sadly enough neither the film or the actor won the coveted award. A lot of people say that it was The Godfather that Pacino proved that he was a great actor and even though in The Godfather he did an excellent job as Michael Corleone, it was in SERPICO, that I feel he was at his very best. He did follow with other great films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and BOBBY DEERFILED and he was brilliant in both but it was after watching SERPICO for the first time that I became aware of Pacino's brilliant acting talent. This film is a MUST if you care about excellence in acting or if you just one to see a great movie.  I highly recommend the book in which the film is based on it is also excellent. You should read the book first and then see the movie to get a better understanding of everthing that the character goes thru but either way if you see the film first and read the book after is no biggie. Both the film and book are excellent and I highly recommend both, nothing short of brilliant on all counts.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This was a very tight movie this is a realy action packed movie.<BR>Something was, bad about it, the sounding sucked full volume you can here OK but it might be my TV.If you like action movies,gang movies,ruthless and about power, you have to by scarface.It is one of the best films alpacino has ever been.Also recomend Carlitos way,and American Me with Edward James Olmos
B00003CXCW|5.0|Screenwriter Bill Holden is trying to lose the repo men on his tail when he coasts up a little used driveway on Sunset Boulevard. The inhabitants angrily yell at him to come into the house, which he does, only to find that they've mistaken him for an undertaker for the funeral of a dead monkey. Times like this, you should know to back out and get going, but he decides to hang around as an &quot;advisor&quot; to monkey mourner Gloria Swanson, a faded silent movie star who has spent years penning her comeback movie script. Doesn't take long for him to move up (or is it down?) to being her gigolo, and be filled with self-loathing in the process.<br />I greatly enjoyed seeing &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; only a few months ago at NYC's Film Forum. I had a dim recollection of it from years before, so I was glad to catch it again on the big screen. Swanson is just wonderful in her role as Norma Desmond, who &quot;used to be big&quot;, according to Holden. It's a crying shame that this movie didn't result in a true comeback for her, as she obviously was capable of being a first-rate sound actress. On hand as her chauffeur and one-time director (and husband!) is Erich von Stroheim, himself the mad director who was arguably responsible for the crack-up of Swanson's career with the notorious &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; movie produced by Swanson's then-lover Old Joe Kennedy. These two--Swanson and von Stroheim--really had a lot of guts to set aside past differences to make this film  about silent movie has-beens, which both of them were considered by 1950. Just watch the subtlty of von Stroheim's acting, which is often centered, of all places, in his hands. Only a veteran director/actor of a silent screen era would think of conveying that much with his appendages!<br />How about Holden? Well, he's good certainly as this heel of a guy. The only qualm I have about him is that he doesn't suggest an extremely young man, which is an important plot device in this movie. The audience is supposed to be reviled by the idea of the older woman pursuing so relentlessly this younger man--and she's successful, to the point where she does manage to land  him sexually if not emotionally! Bill is younger than Gloria, yes, but since the actress was in remarkably good condition physically, he doesn't seem like so many years her junior. Interesting, now of course from year 2003, to see how this idea of the older woman/younger man romance is supposed to appall you, when the 1950s would showcase two actresses--Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn--whose movies always seemed to link them romantically with years-older leading men like Cooper, Grant, Bogart, Crosby, Astaire. How come that's okay, but this Swanson character's desire is supposed to repel you? Sexism, sexism, sexism.<br />Kick that idea to the curb, and set about enjoying &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and the great performances offered by Swanson, von Stoheim, and Holden.
0385504209|5.0|This is the first book by Mr. Brown I've ever read and I read the first 20 pages the first night I read it.  Just reading the excerpt on the web site I wanted to read more of this book.  The mixture of history, intrigue and non-strop action kept me deeply interested in this book.  It was great!
B00005JKJA|5.0|To illustrate my admiration for this film, I want to share my initial interpretation. After the movie, I thought \\"Oh, Diane is in Hell and this is her punishment for having her lover murdered (because who's to say that Hell isn't a state of mind)\\". Think about it, what could be more tormenting than having everything (good looks, talent, a great house, a budding career, an adoring and beautiful lover, a doting aunt), and then have everything fall apart. At first, there are just little hints of impending doom (dog poop in the courtyard), which get steadily more ominous (a crazy neighbor who says Betty isn't who she claims to be). Even during the love scene between the two women, notice that Betty says she loves Rita twice, and Rita does not reciprocate. Then, the club Silencio, where the singer sings Crying, a reference to Betty's unrequited love. The monstrous man behind the restaurant is the Devil, and the two old people (initially benevolent, but like everything else becoming nasty and twisted towards the movie's end) are demons or furies who torment Betty/Diane to take her own \\"life\\" (although she's already dead). Remember they pop out of the blue box (a symbolic representation of Hell) that the Devil carries, and the key to Hell is also the signal that Diane has suceeded in her plan to have her lover murdered. Finally, Diane is transformed from the sweet, wholesome \\"Betty\\" (and perhaps when she came to Hollywood, she really was just like that) to the bitter, rejected failure of \\"Diane\\".<br />Anyway, I could go on and on, but then I read some of the reviews here, which explained the \\"First half of the movie is a dream\\". And I wondered if I had totally missed the point. But then I thought, a good case could be made for the \\"She's in Hell\\" interpretation. This points out the richness of this film. I would compare it to a great but challenging novel. Some works of art require more energy and effort, but richly reward your concentration and patience.<br />Just one more thing I want to note: my irritation with those people who took a prudish, Puritanical stance regarding the movie because of the sexuality. Come on people, it's an R-rated film, what do you expect! I am especially aghast at the people who were shocked (SHOCKED!) when watching this film with their children. Children under 18 are NOT supposed to watch R films and I wonder at these people's judgement. Re the lesbian content: who cares that it's two women? The love story could just as easily have been about a man and a woman, it's about rejection, people of all sexual orientations can relate. And the [self-gratification] scene, in which Diane despairly pleasures herself again and again, only to realize that there is no true fulfillment without her lover: I found it to be heartbreakingly sad and the very opposite of erotic. The only thing that excited me was Naomi Watts' incredible acting.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This is a very dark superhero movie.  Ben Affleck plays Matt Murdock, a pro bono lawyer by day and an avenging superhero by night.  Murdock was blinded in his childhood.  After suffering that tragedy, he discovered that his remaining senses had become much stronger.  His sense of hearing became so powerful that he could see with a kind of radar sense.  As a child his father was killed by gangsters.  He vows revenge, so that is why he has become a superhero.  He wants to find his father's killer.<br />In this movie Murdock runs into the beautiful but dangerous Elecktra.  After an initial battle, they become fast friends.  The trouble starts when Elecktra's father wants to back out of a deal with the Kingpin.  The Kingpin hires an assasin, Bullseye, to get rid of Elecktra and her father. Can Daredevil save them?  Watch and see.<br />At first, I was a little worried about the casting of this movie, but after seeing it, I have to say everyone turned in a solid performance.  I particularly liked Colin Farrell's performance as Bullseye.  Also there are some spectacular fight scenes in this movie.  In particular, there is a super fight scene in a bar that is a must see.  The reason that I gave this four stars is that sometimes the CG is a little too much.  For example, in the opening credits, they use a CG rat, as if it was difficult to get a rat.  However the CG isn't as bad as in the recent Hulk movie.
0671688782|3.0|> I have mixed opinions of this book, because it gives readers a tool which can be highly beneficial, or potentially very damaging, depending on circumstances.  And it doesn't tell readers how to judge whether it's likely to be beneficial or damaging to them.       > I've studied Dr. Welch's system of attachment therapy (which includes holdings among various family members) -- as well as other systems of attachment therapy -- because of my interest in the effect of attachment disorders, and attachment therapy, on the brain.  I've seen many Welch holdings.       > In a large majority of cases, I've seen (and family members have confirmed) moderate to \\"miraculous\\" positive results.  However, I've also seen a few cases with minimal positive results, mixed results, or negative results.       > The minimal positive results I've observed occurred in cases where a mother read Dr. Welch's book and did holdings without a therapist's guidance.  In their holdings, these mothers appeared to fall into the same patterns of relating to their children that they used day-to-day -- ways of relating that weren't working well.  In other words, with no therapist to guide them into different ways of relating to their children, these moms were \\"stuck in the same old rut\\" whether holding or not.       > I've seen negative results in cases where the mother had been traumatized (by physical abuse, for just one example) in a situation where she herself had been physically restrained in some way.  Even in cases where the mother was aware of the traumatizing incident(s) and had worked on the resulting issues in therapy, physically holding her own child could trigger a physiological state of alarm/distress.  I particularly want to emphasize that some mothers could experience this physiological distress, perhaps with trauma-generated feelings such as fear, horror, or shame, without being aware of trauma in their past or having specific trauma memories come up.       > In these cases, the child'snervous system picks up the mother's physiological alarm/distress and the child feels unsafe in the holding.  Mother and child can't reach a good \\"resolution\\".  The child can easily be conditioned to fear, resent, and avoid close physical and emotional contact with the mother.  In my opinion, holding in these situations can be severely damaging.       > I'm aware of one case in which a mother with a history of both physical and sexual abuse did holdings with a child with mixed results when the holdings occurred in a therapeutic setting with support from both a well-trained, experienced therapist and the mother's husband; and with highly negative results when the mother did holdings alone at home.       > Please note that I don't mean to say that all mothers who get mixed or negative results from holding have been physically or sexually abused; or that a mother with trauma in her past can't do holdings with good results.  I'm simply giving examples of what I've observed.       > In another case, a therapist made a serious error in telling the parents that the father (as well as the mother) could do holdings with an insecurely attached young child.  The child's experience was that the father was depriving the child of the mother, and the result of (just one) holding was that the child became severely distrustful and avoidant toward the father.       > I have also seen mixed and negative results of holdings when parents were guided in a holding by a therapist who had inadequate training or experience, or unresolved attachment or abuse issues of his/her own.       > Welch holdings are powerful medicine.  For some families Welch holdings are appropriate and helpful and even miraculous.  For some families, because of circumstances beyond family members' control, Welch holdings can be powerful bad medicine -- at least until the issues that lead to negative or mixed results can be fully resolved.  To both advocates and opponents of Welch holdings, I say there are many pathsto healing and healthy relationships; let's look for the paths that fit our needs, capabilities, and circumstances -- without judging others for whom different paths may be more appropriate.       > As a rule of thumb, I'd say that if you read Dr. Welch's book and your reaction is fear or horror, Welch holdings aren't a good approach for you to use; and if you try them, you may well get mixed or negative results.  If you read the book and your gut reaction is positive, Welch holdings are likely to work very well for you.  If you read the book and your reaction is mixed, perhaps it would be best to look for a different approach; or modify the holdings in ways that make you feel quite all right about doing them; or perhaps look for a therapist to work with who is well trained and experienced in Welch holdings.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson does it again.  This is a masterpiece that will live for ages.  THis is the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  In this movie, we start to get into the real action of the story.  The highlight of this movie is the battle at Helm's Deep.  To see the swarms of orcs and Uruk-hai throw themselves against the wall while the humans and elves try to repulse them is just one of the greatest screen experiences ever.  You won't be disappointed by it.<br />For me I was really impressed by the job done on Gollum.  In this movie Gollum is done as a CG character, but it's not at all cheesy.  Recently we have been bombarded with lots of uneccesary CG in movies, but you won't feel that way about this movie.  Particularly Gollum's facial expressions are excellent and the other character's reactions to him are very believable (maybe George Lucas should take a look at this film).  My favorite scene is when Gollum is have an internal conversation with himself.  As he plays the different sides of his personality, his expressions change so much that you almost feel as if it is a different character.  As I mentioned before the CG isn't as noticable as in other films, and the reason is that you just really caught up in the story.  It sweeps you away to another existance.  It's a shame there aren't more movies like this being made.  It's a real must see.  Check it out.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright has done it again with his &quot;pop-opera&quot; compositions and off-kelter harmonies. THIS ONE IS BIG--and I mean that in terms of instrumentation and vocal harmonies! As I played it over and over again in my car, I kept trying to figure out what the wall-to-wall harmonies reminded me of and then it finally came to me: George Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; album. &quot;Wha--?&quot;, you ask? No, REALLY. I'm thinking especially of Wainwright's &quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot; as it echoes Harrison's &quot;Wah Wah&quot;.<br />Need I mention the HUGE HORNS and the Gershwin sounding pianos in &quot;Oh What A World&quot; or the singer's particular GIFT for caressing each part of the lyric in &quot;Natasha&quot;? I know, I know--this CD doesn't have the quiet sweetness of many of the tracks on &quot;Poses&quot; and at first that ALMOST put me off, but TRUST ME--if you can get on board with this impossible-to-categorize singer/songwriter, and his utter lack of X-Gen hipness (if there's a drum machine in here, I can't detect it), then treat your ears to one of the most original popsters of our age!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|What a great follow-up albumn for Perfect Circle!  I was simply amazed that Maynard could top his vocals from the first albumn but he certainly does, displaying an uncanny ability to convey every emotion from anger to love, and despair to supreme confidence.  He is truly remarkable.  I had the good fortune to see Perfect Circle play at Lollapalooza here in Phoenix and this band is just as amazing live.  My favorite songs have to be The Outsider and Pet....absolute hard rock at its best.  If you are a fan of the first albumn this will not disappoint...get it !
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|the first time i heard this album, i did not like it at all.  it is quite different than the first album, i was so happy to see APC back with another album.  i was especially excited about their cover, yes a cover.  many of you may not realize that THE NURSE WHO LOVED ME was originally done by the now defunct band FAILURE  on their album FANTASTIC PLANET (which is also amazing and worth checking out) FAILURE'S version is a lottle more rocking while APC is subtle and quiet.  <BR>     i thought APC'S first album was simutaneous implosion and explosion.  the guitars haunting and screming and very atmospheric in sound(especially on MAGDALENA)  this album is slightly more mellow and has a different sound.   you cannot fully absorb this album on one listen and it may take you awhile to be comfortable with and digest this album as it is different.  slightly prettier with a mellower sound and more cohesive as an album than MER DE NOMS.   also of note is the fact that marilyn manson bassist twiggy ramiriz (real name  jeordie white) joins APC for this album and i have always known what a great musician he is and maybe now he will have band to really let him shine.  finally, i also see james iha (formerly in the smashing pumpkins)joining the lineup two musicians <BR>    After a weeks worth of listens, i find this album interesting.  there is stuff going on in the background you do not pick up right away.  the melodies while quiet and somber are subtle and grow on you.  there were songs like VANASHING that i hated on first listen and was prepared to skip over but the more i listen the more i hear how beautiful that song is and i think that is a good example of the whole album.
0380789035|2.0|This book gets an incredible amount of praise on Amazon and elsewhere, and the reason why is beyond me.  Neil Gaiman is certainly a very literate writer of comics.  In fact, over the past 15 years or so, he gave the comic medium a degree of culture and style.  This ability, unfortunately, is not present in his novels.  Strangely, the SANDMAN comic, written for a medium that is usually dismissed as children's fare, is much more intellectual than his novels, which contain much adult fare (sex, blood, violence, etc.) but are hardly constructed on an adult reading level.<br />Gaiman's basic premise definitely got my attention: the last showdown between the gods of old civilization and the so-called gods of modern America.  Sounds great... in fact, the whole plot of the novel is a lot of fun.  The problem is that it is carried out in such an amateurish and lackluster fashion.  Gaiman incorporates many tired standards into this novel to further the plot, give foreshadowing, or whatever.  He of all people should know better!  I knew I was in for a questionable read in the first chapter of the book by this classic and wholly original bit of foreshadowing: \\"There's a storm coming\\".  Ooooooh, how dark, and how mysterious.  It didn't send shivers down my spine, but it sure did make my stomach turn.  Why not just start the novel with \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"?<br />Let's face it: Gaiman works wonders with comics, but his novels are second-rate.
0792841344|4.0|for a horror film ,there is little gore and i think thats genius.  the story of Mike.  this little boy who idolozes his older brother Jody and follows him everywhere.  the loss of Jody's friend (Tommy) brings thenm to morningside funeral hoemwhere mike strats noticing all things are not as they appear.<br />  he notices the tall man, one of the best villians to grace the small screen, and so begins our movie.  a trip filled with deadly silver spheres, ghoulish dwarves (which are actually half humans) and at the center of it all is Mike, Jody and their friend Reggie fighting the Tall Man.  The great thing about our heroes is that they are not stupid as in most horror films.  the hero does not fall down repeatedly as the killer plods along slowly behind them.  Jody, Mike and Reggie are smart and resourceful using their heads for more than a place to have a machete inserted.<br />  one of the better horror films of its time and stil stands up today especially when today's horror is nothing to scream about.<br />  As for the dvd features, as a fan of this movie and its sequels, it was interesting to see the tall man, played by Angus Scrimm, as a human.  he did various horror conventions and spoke a bit and it was, after only knowing him as the Tall Man, interesting to see him as a human.  he is quite diverse as an actor (and quite funny)  Angus also introduces the movie which is cool as is the behind the scenes documentary which gives you a good look at the world behind the phantasm.  very cool stuff indeed.
B000000YG5|5.0|This is truly one of the &quot;must have&quot; classic jazz albums. Sonny Rollins' tone and technique is masterful.  Don't miss St. Thomas, Strode Rode and the classics you see in the &quot;Real Books&quot;.  These are now jazz standards. Every jazz student today plays these tunes - listen to the originals and be inspired.
B000089RVR|4.0|I just bought this CD, and I think it is as good as \\"No Angel\\" in its own way.  \\"White Flag\\" is in my Top 3 songs of the year...I would nominate it for Record and Song of the Year at Grammy time if I could (along with Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\").  The album is a little more experimental than \\"No Angel,\\" but I think it is awesome she's taking some risks and not doing the same old CD again.  It seems as though a lot of people are putting down Dido and John Mayer's newests because they are not the same old song and dance; I am happy that these artists are expanding their horizons instead.  Oh, and I love the title track, \\"Stoned\\" (the song is so addictive and beautifully haunting) and \\"See You When Your 40,\\" and the catchy, cool \\"Sand In My Shoes\\" too.
B00004XONN|5.0|this is it:<BR>ethereal, sublime, majestic.<br />looking at the calender, i see that 'kid a' came out almost exactly three years ago today, but it hasn't aged a day. each listen of the album brings something new -- be it sonic, like the infinite layers of sound on 'idioteque', or compositional, like the 5/4 tunes 'everything in its right place' and 'morning bell' or emotional, like the way 'national anthem' sounds angry one time, and simply frenetic the next.<br />there is no way to hear 'kid a' the same way twice. even better is the fact that the more you listen to the record, the more you learn from it. the more emotion you garner from it. the more it becomes a soundtrack to the post-millennial world we live in.<br />there has been speculation that 'kid a' is a concept album, and tells the story of the first human clone's journey through life, beginning with his birth [the first five notes of 'everything in its right place'] and ending with the last line of 'motion picture soundtrack' ['i will see you in the next life.']. whether or not you buy adhere to any of that conjecture is pretty much irrelevant, because it is completely impossible to deny the musical masterpiece that 'kid a' is.<br />johnny greenwood's ondes martenot on 'idioteque', the harps in 'motion picture soundtrack', the big band in 'the national anthem' -- these are all examples of the different kinds of sounds employed by radiohead while creating the best album i own. <br />whether you choose to buy in to the record, and listen to it with an open heart and mind, or simply enjoy it for its varied and perfect musical compositions and performances, this is a classic for the ages.<br />buy the cd. play it in the car on some dark night when you have nothing better to do than drive, and then reassess your place in the universe.
B00005U1YO|5.0|The Brothers didn't miss on this LP.  Their newest album, COME WITH US, is a masterpiece that trully reveals the genius of the duo.  Bringing themselves more into the mainstream than by their last album, SURRENDER (in itself a awesomely great work of electronica), they &quot;tweak&quot; the art of Big Beat music even further, adding even harder twists and turns, lyrics, and synthetic sounds by spicing up the the tracks with intergalactic beats and rythms.  If you like artists like the Crystal Method, Daft Punk, Dirty Vegas, General Midi, Fatboy Slim, Wise Guys, Dub Pistols, or the Headrillaz, you will love this album.  It is listenable from start to end.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie slipped under my radar for about 2 years. then some one told me it was good and i just ignored them. my interest in this movie was due to vanity.... sort of. i overheard some classmates talking about harry potter and time travel and i made a comment that i knew alot about time travel and asked if i could interject some one called me donnie darko . they were all like \\"you ARE donnie darko!\\" and i merely wanted to find out if that was complementary or not. i never figured that out, but i found a movie to dethrone fight club as my 2nd favorite movie and giveing tennenbaums a serious run for its money. when i heard this story i had no idea how \\"frank\\" the rabbit would present itself and i had no idea what the rest of the movie was about. after just visited the wbesite for the movie i just went out and bought the movie. it took me almost 6 hours to watch the movie cuz i kept watching the first 30 minutes over and over and over again. i didnt want it to end. this movie has the characteristics of some dreams ive had. you know , the ones where you think , that would never happen and in the world of donnie darko, they do.  i dont wanna spoil the ending for all those who havent seen the movie but the ending, although good, just depressed me. i was wiped out for the rest of the week. but it was good sort of wiped out. anyway, if you open to something weerd and your smart enough not to just dismiss this movie as utter confusion then this will be one of yur favorite movies ever.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|I play it all the time. Yes, it could have been longer, but more importantly, more care should have been taken in naming the tracks. Track 2 is &quot;Captain Jack Sparrow's Theme&quot; played during one of the best entrances any actor/character has had in any film ever.
B000002H6C|5.0|I've heard many people say the sound production of AJFA was the worst. In my opinion it has to be THE BEST production of any Metallica record! If anyone listening to Metal in the late 80s/ early 90s will remember, the sound at the time was VERY slick and VERY overproduced. Every metal band had that &quot;big budget&quot; sound. Metallica gave the big &quot;FU&quot; and broke convention by offering a more parred down sterile production that many later metal bands like Helmet would try to emulate. I'd have to say Metallica did for Metal what Nirvana did for popular Rock music at the time. Listen to Lar's bass drum, it's high and not very bassy. Every metal band from Pantera to Fear Factory  would later emulate that bass drum sound. And it's practically a staple sound for many Grindcore/Death metal bands today. If you dont own AJFA do yourself a favore and get it, listen to it, and prepared to be blown away by this masterpiece! because you'll likely never to hear a better release from Metallica again.
B00005JKZU|3.0|I bought the first movie, but have no intentions on buying the second.  After watching the first movie I went and bought the books.  I didn't read the first book, because I had seen the movie so I started with the second book before the second movie came out.  After reading the second book I was greatly disappointed with the movie because it hardly followed the book accurately.  Half the time I found myself saying, &quot;That didn't happen in the book!&quot; or &quot;That's not what the book said!&quot;  It will be interesting to see how the third movie matches the third and final book. (I don't even want to read the first book now afraid of how different the story might be from the movie.)  So my advise is either watch the movies only or read the book only, don't do both or you'll be disappointed.
B000059HAI|5.0|There are not many movies that portray the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as anything but what it was--a carefully planned massive assault on a totally unprepared United States naval base.  TORA TORA TORA is not Hollywood's typical war movie that places character exposition at the forefront.  Here directors Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku for the Japanese and Richard Fleischer for the United States detail a film that is more documentary than character driven.  Yet, despite this sense of hidden-camera reality that focuses on all ranks from admiral to seaman, the actors succeed in infusing the film with a feeling that on both sides there were no heroes or villans.  In fact, if there is any villainy, it is not the attacking Japanese who must wear the mantle of evil but rather the slipshod arrogance of those who were entrusted to defend Pearl Harbor against just the kind of annihilation that struck on that Sunday morning in December, 1941.  The Japanese side is told primarily through the perspective of Admiral Yamamoto (So Yamamura), who was in overall command of the attack fleet, and Lt. Commander Fuchida (Takahiro Tamura), who was one of the Zero pilots on the first attack wave.  Yamamoto is a cautious commander, one who has no political agenda, but is determined to carry out his objective exactly even if it means not taking advantage of unexpected opportunities to wreak further destruction on American ships.  He will preserve his fleet above all else.  Fuchida has a much more narrow view; when he sees that a second attack wave is needed to finish the job, he is appalled that Yamamoto has instead ordered the fleet to return to Japan.  Neither of them is presented as the stereotyped buck-toothed sabre-rattling Jap so often presented in a previous generation's war movie.  Each in his own way is strictly business.  The American side is anchored by Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel and Richard Anderson as Captain Earle.  Kimmel is a competent commander who discovers too late that bureaucratic bungling of misguided messages can have the most tragic of consequences.  When the attack begins, he is stunned but quickly organizes what defenses he has.  The fall guy is Earle, who might have gained a precious few hours of advanced warning had he heeded the implications of frantic radio messages suggesting an attack was imminent.  Yet, Earle is a one-dimensional stick man who collectively symbolizes the head-in-the-sand myopia that then afflicted US military intelligence about the oncoming Rising Sun whirlwind.  <br />TORA TORA TORA is a film of rapidly shifting points of view.  The first three quarters is a microscopic analysis of the events preceding the attack.  The Japanese are seen as supremely confident that they will achieve total surprise.  In fact, when the first Zero fighters are in view of Pearl, they are astounded to note that not one shot has been fired at them.  An American radar station operator notes that his radar screen shows a massive inflight of unidentified planes, but a call to his superiors results in his being told not to worry.  The American fleet and dozens of combat planes are neatly stacked in rows, just waiting to be picked off.  The Americans, by contrast, are blithely oblivious to what now seems like unmistakable warnings of looming disaster.  In Washington, Japanese ambassadors Nomura (Shogo Shimada) and Kurusu (Hisao Toake) wait patiently outside the door of Secretary of State Cordell Hull, knowing full well what was then occuring on the other end of the world.  For the briefest moment, Nomura is seen as a man who is profoundly saddened that he is a forced puppet mouthing words of a futile peace.  <br />All of the behind the scenes style of film making is needed as a segue to the catastrophic air assault on Pearl. The attack, which lasts for an extended thirty minutes, is stunningly effective, even more so than the computer-enhanced graphics of the recent remake with Ben Affleck.  Essentially, the Japanese airplanes swoop down and destroy both docked ship and arrayed plane.  The return fire is piecemeal.  Here and there is a spirited ra-ta-ta by a lone America gunner.  The surprise is complete.  Three battleships are sunk, and nearly every plane is destroyed on the ground.  These scenes of carnage are difficult to watch, yet they serve to remind us that eternal vigilance is needed for a proud country to survive.  The dramatic focus of the movie is not on the destruction of the Pacific fleet at all, but surprisingly on the Japanese view of that destruction.  The Japanese had intended to declare war first, and then to attack, but a bungling on their part reversed this order.  A despondent Admiral Yamamoto concludes the film by noting to his otherwise jubilantly cheering subordinates: &quot;I can hardly imagine a way that is more likely to infuriate the Americans.  I fear that all we have done was to awaken a sleeping giant.&quot;  TORA TORA TORA is unique among war films in that it shows that even in war, there are men of good conscience who are caught up in matters over which they have very little control.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|My child loves this movie so much that our tape is almost worn out.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The new A Perfect Circle album is very removed from it's first album. The album still possesess the balance of hard rock and ecclectic melody; but, The Thirteenth Step conveys a more stripped down medium of music. Some songs are very parallel to that of Tool's sound. Unlike Mer De Noms, A Perfect Circle's new album has a better sense of direction. The songs are placed in a way that it allows you to be lost within the album. Mer De Noms was more of a display of the possibilities of this band. With The Thirteenth Step, they implement their sound into a more meaningful, focused, sound. The Thirteenth Step is more of a concept album. Dealing with the struggles of addiction. Some will be quick to say that this album is about the struggle of drug addiction. I believe you may interpret the album into any kind of addiction that is self destructive. The album ranges from hard/melodic songs like Weak and Powerless, to The Nurse Who Loved Me, a symphonic melody that makes you feel as if you were dreaming. So in retrospect...A Perfect Circle's new album is ambitious and they succeed with their direction. It's very different from their first record, therefore showing growth within the band. If you're a fan of Maynard's haunting voice, Howerdell's screaming guitar's, Freese's impulsive percussion, and White's soothing bass riffs...this CD is a must have for you're collection. The album will require many repeat listenings to truly appreciate the band's new effort. A Perfect Circle has pulled it off again, they've produced a emotional/technical masterpiece. A must have for true music fans.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I love watching the Harry Potter movies, and reading the books. It's nice to read a book and then watch a movie made about it and see that they go together great.

B0000AMA6E|3.0|Many of the new releases of Disney are able only in English or French language tracks.  I have been looking for a store where I can find movies in DVD with Spanish version or subtitled because my kids and my family don't speak another language.  All the Disney's movies are great and I love them but I'd like to make a collection with spanish version. This's my problem when I want to buy another movie of Hollywood too.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a movie about finding love, accepting yourself, and having it all--whatever that means to you.<BR>I thought James Spader was perfect for this role.

0393057658|4.0|Will this be the legacy of the Oakland A's?  Nine consecutive losses in games that could have clinched the American League Division Series?  Did you watch last night's Game 5 of the 2003 ALDS, Oakland against the Boston Red Sox?  It was a remarkable bit of baseball.  Even skipping all the baserunning errors and pitching changes, Oakland only trailed 4-3 in the bottom of the 9th, with Boston's highly suspect bullpen poised to give the game to Oakland.<br />This is how the inning unfolded for Oakland: Walk.  Walk.  Sacrifice bunt.  Called strike three.  Walk.  Called strike three.<br />No runs.  No hits.  No swings.  No errors.  Three men left on.  Red Sox 4, A's 3.<br />The legacy of Billy Beane is a story that's not yet fully written.  There are now three AL teams that play Moneyball -- Boston and Toronto as well as Oakland.  Two of those are playoff teams, and Toronto is on the march, perpetually improving third-place finishers in a strong division.  The story of &quot;Moneyball&quot;, as told by Michael Lewis, effortlessly recounts the &quot;stathead&quot; revolution: how analysis of baseball stats went from the only three stats shown on TV in the '70s (BA, HR, RBI), to the more complex methods espoused by Harvard men like Paul DePodesta, who came to power at the height of the small-market revolution.  Unbeknownst to baseball's asleep-at-the-wheel Commissioner, there is a way to win ball games without expensive free agent signings.  Billy Beane's A's have won four straight AL West titles, espousing the virtues of patience, power, pitchers who throw strikes.  Under his philosophy, teams can win with or without the high-salaried slugger (Jason Giambi, who crawled his way to a .250 batting average with the Yanks in 2003), without the highly-paid manager (Art Howe, who sleepwalked his way to a last-place finish with the Mets in '03, and hopefully won't be back).  Oakland wins every year, even as their salary plummets.  They'll lose Miguel Tejada this winter, and stillwin at least 95 games in 2004.  This is baseball... without the baseball. <br />Where are the limits to winning Moneyball?  You go deep into the A's lineup in the bottom of the 9th in the One Big Game they couldn't win:  where was the slugger?  Where was the scary bat?  For a team that prides itself on the big picture (the three-run homer), where were the fundamentals?  Why didn't Eric Byrnes touch home in Game 3?  Why did two different innings in Game 5 end when baserunners were gunned down (by a mile each) going for the extra base?  Why did Ramon Hernandez sac-bunt in the 9th, giving the Red Sox pitchers the out they couldn't get themselves?  Why didn't Melhuse and Long *swing* at strike three?<br />In the long run, Moneyball has proven itself to be a winning philosophy.  The sabermetrics revolution is in its early stages, not its late stages -- in spite of Oakland's repeated playoff failures; in spite of Anaheim's throwback World Series win in 2002; in spite of George Steinbrenner's bank vault and cable millions.  This is the wave of the future, the natural answer to baseball's escalating salary structure:  you can win without paying $6 million a year to a .260 hitter who doesn't walk, or without paying Todd van Poppel money to Todd Van Poppel.<br />However... why are the A's 0-9 in championship games?<br />Why didn't the team take their bats off their shoulders when it really counted?
B000002UAX|4.0|The granddaddy of all &quot;alternative&quot; rock is found here. Deliberately under-produced, inconsistent in its song-quality, but masterfully sequenced (which makes it seem more clever than it really is), The White Album is utterly unique among the Fab Four's output. Some may have this as their desert-island disc, and others might use it as a frisbee or a beverage coaster. But most will likely use that special &quot;programming&quot; feature of their CD player (that they almost forgot was there) to hear their &quot;favorite&quot; tracks.

0385504209|5.0|Kudos to Dan Brown for writing a gripping novel that pushed a lot of my buttons (in a positive way).<br />This book has great pacing, with a twist or important occurrence happening about every three or four pages.  Amazingly, the author has written a plausible plot that hurtles through four hundred plus pages covering a period of less than twenty-four hours.<br />For history buffs, this book captures the imagination.  Great figures like Leonardo Da Vinci and Sir Isaac Newton figure prominently in the plot.  The Vatican, Opus Dei, the Knights Templar and a secret society that may still exist called the Priory of Sion are part of the story.<br />For those who like mysteries and codes, the book abounds with them.  The author gives the reader enough background information and clues that it is possible to appreciate and even figure out some of the codes that drive the story forward from solution to solution and the ultimate prize.<br />And a clever story it is.  Without revealing the central mystery, this book revolves around two forces continuing an almost two millennium battle over information that could rock the very foundations of the Catholic Church and Christianity.  A murder in the Louvre of one of the principals in this battle brings Dr. Robert Langdon, -- Harvard Symbologist who specializes in church symbols, mysteries and codes -- together with the beautiful Sophie Neveau -- French police code breaker with a few mysteries of her own.  The eighteen or so hours after the murder involve the two central figures, flight and manhunts across the France and England, double crosses and mysterious personages, quick lessons in church history, the art of Leonardo Da Vinci, the Knights Templar and the very early Christian Church (as early as it gets) and code breaking from verse, art and symbols.<br />Brown gives the reader a heck of a ride.  This book works as a thriller, intellectual exercise, and historic fiction.<br />I have to say historic fiction because Brown has taken some license with history to create the situation needed to foster his story.  My only criticism of the book is the author's forward note in which he claims truth regarding the organizations and events portrayed in the book.  It is true that the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sion, the Dead Sea Scrolls and symbolism in Da Vinci's art exist.  However, the author does use these truths in a subjective way to support his thriller.<br />He makes claims for the Council of Nicea and the Dead Sea Scrolls that are not accurate, or are tenuous at best.  His statement that most Christians at the time of the Council believed Christ was a fully human, non-divine being is contradicted by everything I've read of Church history (without going into it here, see [...] which states that those holding the non-divine position were a very distinct minority of contemporary Christians).  Also, the Dead Sea and other recent scrolls do not give the statements ascribed to them by the author, except for one which contains an ancient Greek word that can be translated in various ways -- and upon one translation not generally accepted he bases his assertions).<br />The above are important because the general statement of truth the author makes would lead some to believe he meant existence of the historic characters, groups and happenings as well as the conclusions he takes from them.<br />That digression aside, this is one of the best novels I've read -- great pacing, fascinating history, terrific conspiracy and interesting symbology and code breaking.

B0000C5RQF|5.0|I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewer - this production is a marvel.  All things considered, this is perhaps the finest and most stylish realization of Zauberflote I've ever seen, and indeed one of the best productions of any opera that I've experienced, either on stage or DVD.  This is one of those rare productions where everything comes together perfectly - a great cast, wonderful sets, strong direction, amazing costumes, and top notch conducting &amp; orchestral playing.<br />My hat must go off to David McVicar for pulling off brilliantly what is in my opinion the most difficult of Mozart's operas to stage convincingly.  In fact, this is the first production of Zauberflote where I really felt that the staging was worthy of the music.  While I have always loved the music, I have generally not been that impressed whenever I saw the opera performed - too many productions try to make it more cutesy or humorous than it really is, whereas in fact, Zauberflote is a very serious opera, more dark than light...  McVicar realizes this, and gives us a Zauberflote that is appropriately weighty, dramatic and mysterious without shortchanging the more humorous aspects of the score.  Bravo to whoever designed the costumes as well - I especially like the way they embrace the wierd and grotesque in the portrayal of Monostatos and the Queen of the Night.  <br />The cast is a very strong one.  Dorthea Roschmann is a real flesh-and-blood Pamina, who sings with a full-bodied tone and tremendous dramatic intensity.   Tamino and Papageno are both well served by Will Hartmann and Simon Keenlyside, and Franz-Jospeh Selig is a noble Sarastro.  My greatest praise however, goes to Diana Damrau who is the most amazingly scary Queen of the Night I have ever seen.  She hits every note in her two big arias (no small feat) but it's her acting that is really incredible.  She gives the most chilling overall portrayal I've ever seen, bar none.  Wow...<br />Secondary roles are all ablycast as well.  This is a big-time winner, and I recommend it to anyone interested in a DVD of this opera.  Sound quality is very good, picture quality is good but a bit grainy at times (it appears to have been shot on digital film).  5 stars without question.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Avid Cher fans will want this DVD.  Cher is beautiful; the choreography and sets lavish and extravagant.  I would recommend buying this DVD with Cher, Live in Concert.  Cher fans will not want to miss!

0743243307|5.0|Am I the only reader to have noticed the allusion to the great Tagore's The Home and The World, set in West Bengal, and written about a century earlier?  His heroine, also, falls in love with a charismatic religious leader ... the contrast in the style of handling the material, and in the influences of culture, time, and place, are a fascinating study.  And, notice that Ms. Ali refers to Tagore directly several times in her book.  Some readers may wish to read the Home and the World, as a companion to Brick Lane.
B00003CXXS|1.0|Spoilers warning :Jurassic Park, the first episode, was simply innovative, amazing, intelligent, and great. The Lost World was, let's say, bad. But this is different from the two first chapters. Let me explain. This is the (very simple and stupid) story of a young boy doing some kind of parachute with a friend of his parents over Isla Sorna (the island where the story of The Lost World happened). But with some amazing coincidences and unpredictable events (do you feel the sarcasm?), they crash on the island. Then, 8 weeks later (that's a long time to survive, on a near island) the parents pay Alan Grant to come with them save their son on the island. Don't you think the story is stupid? Don't you think this is gratuitous reason to go on an island and get eaten by dinosaurs...This is stupid to the extreme...seriously. But, not only they have a crap-head scenario, but they also have special effects that are really not as good as the first two's. I couldn't recognize the raptors, because teh dinosaur models are different and cheaper, and also, the dinosaurs are so fake sometimes, it's evident...the illusion isn't really there. There are new species of dinosaurs, but the only T-Rex you see lasts only one minute. But the most stupid point of the film, making it a possible winner at the Razzies fest, is the NEW intelligence of the dinosaurs...they communicate like humans (they don't speak, but it almost sounds like that sometimes), they look at each other, they trap humans...this is awfully stupid...and especially in the dinosaur fight, one of them kills the other by holding his head and breaking his neck...and why don't they eat the humans they kill? The acting isn't so good, William H Macy is real bad and fake, like Tea Leoni...some awful one-liners, too predictable to be true...really. The action is so brief, you can't enter into it, there is no stress, no suspense...and the movie has a running time of 85 minutes...plain bad. Overall, stupid story, bad acting, sucky scenario, lame action, no plot, no suspense, just a sell-out under the Jurassic Park title. 2/10
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Imagine Lenny Kravitz and Slash together in one person and that gives you some idea about how this sounds.  I am a ...  music fan and future guitar hero.  Trust me.  You'll be hearing a lot from this Hendricks guy!
B00005JL3A|2.0|&quot;Resident Evil&quot; was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into. It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game. Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play. <br />The same things are not all true in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the film. <br />&quot;Resident Evil&quot; tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center. She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything. After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious. They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy. But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them. <br />In the case of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie. If you've seen &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil. As much as &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is another clone of that model. What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences. It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real &quot;Resident Evil&quot; fans like.<br />A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie. I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress. Even though her role in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen. <br />The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; video games. Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory. Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH! I just can't take it, it's made by computer! This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way. Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad. (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes. But every darn death looks so fake! Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie &quot;Cube&quot;, the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really,really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;'s reunited gore moments. I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real! Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it. <br />The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very &quot;Blockbuster&quot; atmosphere, with nothing really eerie. The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games. The zombies are not scary at all, and the other &quot;creatures&quot; are plain laughable. <br />They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing. The city is still &quot;Raccoon City&quot;, the train really is identical to the one in the game of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc. But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; (the game). <br />Overall, I'd say that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out! &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater. It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years. Not that bad, but nothing great either.
B00007G207|5.0|\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" is the poignant tale of 'Toto', a young and impoverished Italian boy who comes to love the movies when a lonely projectionist allows him a back stage pass into the world of fantasy.  However, Toto soon learns that life and fiction don't co-exist in a world of all too real heartaches and tragedy.  Bring Kleenex, for this sumptuously told tale of young love.<BR>TRANSFER: Well, let's see...for starters there are two versions of the film on this disc: the original theatrical cut which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and a new director's cut that is 59 minutes longer.  Trust me on this one: you want to see the director's cut.  It fleshes out character motivation and the latter half of the story in ways that make the viewing experience so much richer.  <BR>Both versions have been 'digitally remastered' in anamorphic widescreen. The original cut is presented in Dolby Stereo, the new version in 5.1 stereo.  Both are visually rather lack luster in their presentation - with overly dark contrast levels and subdued colors. Nevertheless, age related artifacts are not present and aliasing, edge enhancement and some pixelization inherent in the original release are not present on the special edition. Over all the film looks very clean.  Nothing can detract from the performances - there's not a one to fault in this beautifully told masterpiece.<BR>EXTRAS: NONE! A genuine shame! No, make that a crying shame!!!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: You must see \\"Cinema Paradiso\\".  Brilliant, poignant, tragic, but ultimately a moving experience that - in this age of digital generated this and reality based that - will make you remember why it is that we all go to the movies! This is the reason why motion picture entertainment was invented.  A MUST!
1559408855|4.0|Pier Paolo Pasolini is a man that I consider as a fascinating director. \\"Salò: The 120 Days of Sodom\\" (Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma) was his last film. His most noticeable works include \\"Porcile\\" and \\"The Gospel According To St.Matthew. Well, I would like to be clearer on this point, and I'll say that the word \\"noticeable\\" here is a synonym of \\"best\\". On the other hand, though, I would say that Salò is truly his most talked-about film, if you thought I meant that by noticed. The film is good, but I really preferred the two mentionned above, artistically and intellectually speaking. But Salò has its qualities, even though some of us might consider them as flaws.<br />Salò is based on the Marquis de Sade's novel, entitled \\"Les 120 journees de Sodome\\". The book (of course, it was written way before the fascist period in Italy!) doesn't talk about fascism, and the main common point between the film and the book is the main concept. The film shows the horrors inflicted to a bunch of young and beautiful people that were selected by four sadistic (what a funny use of the word!) fascists that are only willing to quench their own brutal sexual and violent thirsts. They are taken to a villa where the are submitted to the worst humiliations, which include being raped whenever the four masters feel the desire to have sex, eating feces, and later on being brutally tortured and killed.<br />This film is recognized for being one of the sickest of all times, one of the most disgusting also. Well, the \\"shocking content\\" mostly consists of constant nudity of young adults, many rapes, excrement-eating, scalping, tongue mutilation, and eye gouging. There are also pretty nasty stories told by a lady whose role in the villa is to tell sick stories that have for goal to turn on the four masters. I saw movies that were more disgusting than that, sincerely. The context and the cruelty surrounding many acts of violence and humiliation in this film are probably the main reason why itshocked so many people. The sexuality is never explicit (in the way that you never see a penetration graphically), the killings are pretty well done (the scalping especially) but there are very few of them and they are brief. I would say that \\"Caligula\\" is way more graphic and shocking than \\"Salò\\" (but less effective though).<br />Pasolini's directing is beautiful. He made a mistake in one scene, changing the angle of the camera of less than 30 degrees between two shots. Except for that, he's fascinating...he's obsessed with showing symmetrical images...all the time. This technique somehow communicates the \\"discipline\\" and the supposedly high \\"straightness\\" of the fascists pretended to have. Also, the camera often has a pretty wide vision, and we don't often really get close to any character. With such coldness, Pasolini was criticized a lot. People didn't know if it was really a statement against fascism or just a good reason to show horrible things...Personnally, knowing a couple of things about Pasolini's life, I didn't doubt one moment about his intentions. Yes, he had socialist tendencies, yes, he was a homosexual (which fascists hated) and yes, he was against fascism, and it is clear when you see the film. People who only watch American films and are used to explicit messages in films will not understand that, but this film plundges us into cruelty we could have really compared to the nazis', and that's how it delivers its message. Maybe too subtle for some, but sometimes, I think it's better this way...just like in most American movies...an example: American History X talks about racism...\\"Racism is bad\\" is almost written on the walls...it's very sanctimonious, it's really not subtle...but there are movies where they only show horrible things the way they really are, without really giving a judgement in an explicit way...I think it even works better. I am a bit tired of moralizers, to be honest.<br />The acting is very good. Also, I got the French Limited DVD of this film...that's the best edition, trust me! The audio tracks are in french (which Pasolini considered should have been the original language of this film, because it was the Marquis de Sade's and also the original Italian track. The one in french is amazing, really. There are also lots of extras, this is really a must-have. The actors, especially the four fascists, are extremely cold and creepy...Pasolini did a good job directing them.<br />Overall, the film takes a very neutral approach to the horrors it displays, but that's effective. Sure, this is not a perfect movie, it has pretty slow moments and it is not that well structured, but it achieves its goal, which is to make a statement against fascism.
B00003CXB4|5.0|&quot;The Lion King&quot; is basically Shakespeare's Hamlet for children.  When a young lion's father is murdered by his uncle, the rightful heir to the throne must decide if he is equal to the task of ruling.  Brilliantly realized, visually stunning and epic in its scope and entertainment value - this is truly Disney animation at its zenith.<BR>TRANSFER: The good folks at Disney can be proud of their efforts on this 2 disc special edition.  The picture - digitally restored and remastered, is something to behold.  Colors are more vibrant and saturated.  Black and contrast levels are stunning.  There are no blemishes, artifacts, aliasing or other digital anomolies to detract from a visual presentation that is worthy of the lion's share.  The audio is 5.1 Dolby digital and aggressive in its bass, really giving your surround sound a work out.  <BR>EXTRAS: Lots!  There are two versions of &quot;The Lion King&quot; - the original and another featuring a new song - &quot;Morning Report&quot;. The new song is enjoyable but it neither adds or detracts from the impact of the film - it's just there.  There's a featurette on the making of the film, several music videos, some games and the theatrical trailer. <BR>BOTTOM LINE: AN ABSOLUTE MUST!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and a lot of fun.<br />The \\"interstate\\" chase alone was worth the price of admission.
B0000844IT|5.0|What a great way to end the evil dead series, this sequel has lost ALL of the blood and gore from the previous two but don't let that turn you around, this is one of the funnist movies i've ever seen. As evil dead two ended we saw Ash go back in time to medevil times. But Sam Raimi decides to lose the ending where Ash is thier new king. No he tacks on that Ash is a prisoner instead and is sentenced to death when. A mage figures out that hes not an enemy and covinces Ash to help them. This one is about ten times funnier then the second and five hundred billion times funnier then the first. With the twenty minute fight scene in the end and some hilarous mid scenes this one will impress you and unlike the other DVD version this one gives you the origanal ending where a pre dumb and dumber Laurn Holly falls for Ash in the department store. This one is like a violent episode of the three stooges, but this one is pretty far from violent. The DVD itself is impressive and well worth the buy for the special features and the movie itself. This movie is Sam Raimi's top of the line movie...... YOU GOT THAT!!!
B000003C2U|5.0|This is perhaps Death's best album next to leprosy.A very technical and melodic album while being Death's most heavy album ever.All of the songs are outstanding to say the least and it contains classic songs like suicide machine and together as one.Chuck Schuldiner was a musical genius and his vision is clearly displayed on this album.Death is a band which simply rules and will go down in the music hall of fame for this genre of music.It's very sad that this great band is not around anymore and the untimely passing away of a man with great talent and passion.R.I.P Chuck Schuldiner.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Not since &quot;Almost Famous&quot; has a movie so embraced the love of rock 'n' roll.  Jack Black and his talented young group are a revelation - proving that the love of music can transcend the odds.  I think the theme song, &quot;School Of Rock&quot; deserves an Oscar nomination.  I am not kidding!!  Thematically, what other song this year fits its film better?!  And Stevie Nicks should be proud.  She is the only female rocker surrounded by classic male rockers (Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Doors, etc.).  Mike White and crew... ya dun good!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UUX|5.0|This is my favorite Megadeth album of all time.There are no filler songs and all the songs are awesome.The album is fast,heavy and greatly displays the talents of everyone in the band.This album is a golden gem of the band and I would highly recommend this to any fan of the band or thrash music in general.GO OUT AND BUY THIS NOW!!!
B000023VR6|4.0|This was the first Rap CD to really catch my ear and turn me onto a style of music I thought wasn't for me. Dre knows what we all want to hear and he gives to us ten fold on this disc.
B00006BTCA|2.0|i definitely think that interpol are one of the most over-hyped (and least deserving of said hype) of any new york city band today.  i'm also really getting sick of hearing them compared to joy division.  they sound practically nothing like joy division.  who could really?  the singer's voice is way closer to ian mcculloch's and they probably sound a lot more like echo and the bunnymen appropriately enough.  for what it is it's not bad- the first half of the album is really pretty good (except the shameless smiths rip-off 'say hello to the angels'), but if you want something 'dark' that has swelling music building up to 'tragic choruses' (or whatever else journalists have been saying about interpol) listen to calla.  they're way better and more innovative than interpol could ever be.  i think in a perfect world people would go as nuts for calla as they have about interpol, but then this really isn't a perfect world.  i don't know- if this is good enough for you then buy it, but don't go praising it to the stars because it's just not anywhere near as good as people have been saying.  if the hype has piqued your curiosity you'd probably be better off just staying away from this album.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|There's no Vin Diesel this time around and I thought a sequel would  suck without him but...it doesn't. Tyrese (Babyboy) is a fun replacement and it's obvious that he's having a lot of fun in the movie as well. Some people have said Paul Walker can't act and that he doesn't have much of a presence without Vin Diesel. I can't say I had a problem with him though and think he does ok without Diesel. He's not the strongest leading man but he has good chemestry with Tyrese and they make a good buddy team. The cars and women make the movie good as well lol. It's not as serious as the first and doesn't have much of a drama feel to it at all like the first one did. The racing and other action scenes are handled well and this is a fun movie. The little Dukes of Hazard stunt at the end with the car flying on top of a boat is the only problem I had with the movie. It's not as good of an action climax as the film could've used. The confrontation between the heroes and the villain at the end is disapointing as well. The original had much more interesting characters and the end is better in thaht one too. 2 Fast 2 Furious has a lot more action and car chases though and they're entertaining.
0385512104|4.0|I read the book because my son has a mild form of autism, but much milder than the boy in the book. Explaining to family and friends what is different about my son is difficult and I hoped the book might be one way for others to see things from an autistic viewpoint.  The book certainly explains well what life can be like for those who are autistic, regardless of how severe or mild the autism. The story line itself was a real treat, and interesting but the love the father had for his son was most moving.  The frequent use of expletives is something to consider when recommending the book to others.
B000089RVR|4.0|After such a great record like No Angle, Life for rent was bit of a disappointment and could have been better .<BR>well overal it sounds great ! <br />Last four tracks of the CD are my Favourites.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|A hilarious movie that one can watch with a family and not worry about the profanity or vulgarity so common these days. Rowan Atkinson did a wonderful job.
0767849493|5.0|This film is a sick but strangely amusing combination of religon, black humour and the f*&amp;kin strangest cast ever to work together. <br />The film is very funny and will definitely irritate all those religous freaks!
B000002IWQ|4.0|On the positive side, nearly every song on this CD is at least good.  Some are excellent.  On the negative side, Rush's in your face progressive rock sound is an influence rather than a focus of the music.  I suppose that Rush may have felt the need to try different things, and this album is the result.  The music on this CD is well-produced and slick, but in its production it does lose some of what has appealed to many Rush fans.  In places the music sounds like it was influenced by Foreigner, which is a bit strange given Rush's longevity.<br />'Animate' kicks the CD off with a solid rock beat.  The song is solid, but portions of the lyrics are poetry.  Strangely, the very interesting portions of the lyrics are balanced by some of the most simplistic lyrics modeled a bit after 'The Moody Blues' song 'One More Time to Live' from 'Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.'  While the lyrics of the latter worked well at the time, the 'polarize me, sensitize me, etc.' lyrics of the former seem as though they could have been approached differently.<br />'Stick It Out' kicks out with power, with better balance between the music and the lyrics.  Some of the lyrics are poetic, but the music is pure power to drive the poetry into your brain.<br />'Cut to the Chase' has a strong flavor of the Rush of old, and is one of my favorite tracks on this CD.  There are a couple of changes in tempo in the music that match the lyrics really well.  Further, the plaintive notes in the instruments complement the vocals nicely; a solid and interesting song all around.<br />I struggle somewhat with 'Nobody's Hero.'  The music here is interesting, but the lyrics seem to struggle, either in fit to the music, or the topic, which seems a bit confused from the outset.  While I want to like this song, I suspect the lyrics needed different music and vice versa.<br />Then we come to 'Between Sun and Moon,' a fantasy song in the spirit of progressive rock.  One of my favorites that combines the power for which Rush is known so well with wonderfully smoky lyrics that obscure enough to make you feel versus think too hard; a great listening song to listen to the spell-binding combination of lyrics and music.<br />The next song has a title that makes you think it might be a science fiction song, but 'Alien Shore' is about the difference between male and female.  The bass rumble could almost be threatening, but really is trying to hammer the point that we need to understand each other; we need to reach each other; we need to reach the alien shore.  This song is solid rock with a modest flavor of blues in the heavy rock, and more than a touch of progressive elements.<br />'The Speed of Love' follows.  However, the speed seems to be something you would achieve when mired in molasses.  The lyrics are too mellow and never break out the way they seem as though they should.  The music matches the lyrics, but the change in tempo that you keep expecting just never happens.<br />We change structure and style with 'Double Agent,' which has received mixed reviews.  I like this song.  I didn't like it at first, but after listening to it numerous times, and reading the lyrics, I believe this song verges on the borders of nu-metal or thrash.  The hard-driving drums and bass combine with the dark lyrics to yield a surrealistic vision of the land between wake and sleep, between right and wrong, and between darkness and light.  A song worth making the attempt to understand in its musical and lyrical entirety.<br />The instrumental 'Leave that Thing Alone' is solid rock.  There are moments when you capture a flavor of the Rush from the days of 'Moving Pictures.'<br />The CD closes with 'Cold Fire' and 'Everyday Glory.'  The two songs bear some similarity in that they have a certain consistency to them, though the topics are quite different.  The songs are decent, but once again they seem a bit tame for Rush, and perhaps a bit on the commercial side.<br />One difficulty with a group such as Rush is that we continually expect them to top themselves, and when they create acceptable rock, we can be disappointed.  We probably shouldn't be.  After all, not every work of an artist will be a masterpiece.  This album is a worthy addition to your Rush collection; generally good, occasionally excellent, and very accessible throughout.sh is that we continually expect them to top themselves, and when they create acceptable rock, we can be disappointed.

B000089CKH|3.0|This CD isn't bad, but I haven't been able to find anything good about it. I will start with what I have been able to enjoy. Blizzard of '77, which is also on the This Is Next Year compilation (which I would definitely buy for almost the same price as this instead of this) is a good song. And, as far as this album goes, at least it's short. I also like Treading Water, probably because, as another reviewer pointed out, it sounds like it's from the Proximity Effect. <BR>Now, the bad. This is one of the weirdest CDs I've ever heard. I feel like I should like it, not only because it's Nada Surf, but because there's nothing wrong with the songs. Even though they have a different sound than their older stuff, they can still write good melodies. The problem I have with this CD is that all of the songs just sound too slow, but not in a normal sense. It sounds more like they recorded the songs at a normal speed, and then just slowed the entire recording down. And that, of course, really makes it drag. I can't stand listening to this CD all the way through because it seems like it lasts for hours, in a bad way. There's some good stuff on here, but there's a lot more good stuff on their other albums.
B000050IE6|5.0|This is one of those albums where it takes you a while to like. After a while I began to like this album even more. I recognised their talent at first listen and they are fantastic. I like the idea of having several different genres of music in one song. Although my favourite parts are the death metal bits, the acoustic bits are soft and soothing, and when combined with the other instruments, creates an atmosphere. The vocalist is one of the best ever, from doing some of the most crushing death vocals to some of the most beautiful clean vocals. The band is excellent and some of the stand-out tracks here are Serenity Painted Death, White Cluster, Godshead Lament and Benighted. This album is recommended to those who can stand death vocals and can appreciate great musicianship. But don't worry. If you find yourself hating death vocals, buy this album as it has more clean parts on it and it will allow you to get used to them even more. It worked for me!
B000002HAF|5.0|I don't mean what I said in the title in the sense most people would. My favorite Pixies album (and favorite album ever by that matter) is Bossanova. But I use Surfer Rosa to determine what makes an album one of the essentials. Basically, any record that I like as much or more than Surfer Rosa is one of those albums. At any given time, that is around 10 to maybe 15 records.  Anyway, that doesn't really matter; I just think this is useful for doing that. <BR>This was my first Pixies CD and it is definitely fantastic. The ONLY problem I've ever had with the Pixies is that their albums tend to fall off at the end, and the reason I love this album so much is that this problem isn't nearly as bad as on Trompe le Monde (the end of which, I think, is just ridiculous) and Doolittle (except for Gouge Away). Through Cactus, this album is every bit as good as Bossanova, and it has two of the three best Pixies songs (Bone Machine and River Euphrates). After Cactus, the songs are all good, but, I think slightly less so, except for Brick is Red. That's a great song as well. Anyway, the last songs on here are still GREAT songs. I'm sure though, if you're reading this you already have it, or aren't going to hesitate to buy it. If you are hesitating, don't. So I hope that I helped.
0385659792|5.0|Great book told from an amazing perspective
B0000AKCLS|2.0|From Exqweezme: Have to dissent from some of the views here.  Joe's guitar is certainly very good, however I feel he fails to make these songs his own.  His guitar playing is a re-run of texas style blue-rock that we've heard before, and not as good as the truly exceptional artists that ply the trade like SRV, ZZ Top, or even the Fabulous Thunderbirds.<br />Furthermore, his lyrical arrangement and style seem rather trite.  His vocalization reflects to much artificiality which  lacks a serious understanding of what the blues is and how it should be played.<br />I'm willing to except these downfalls from a 15 year old Jonny Lang, but not someone like Joe who has been a proffesional musician for this long.  Hopefully his future offerings will show a bit more substance than his current one.  Until then I will continue to re-listen to older classics like Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, B.B. King, and John Lee Hooker and anxiously await the modern masters of blues, Eric Clapton and Keb Mo (and maybe in the future Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Sheppard, and Susan Tedeschi).
0312979479|5.0|This book is a good attention holder. It keeps you drawn in throughout most of the book. It starts out a little confusing, but it gets a lot better. It is about 10 strangers who share a common background that end up on a mysterious island. One by one they are killed, and coincidently each one of their deaths is foretold by a poem hung in each of their bedrooms. The ending is a complete surprise, and really adds to the story. Overall, this book is definitely worth reading - highly recommended if you like good mysteries.
6305922756|5.0|Maybe it's my weakness for silly humor, but &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; is easily in my top 5 list of comedies -- and this DVD really completes the whole &quot;Tap&quot; experience. The in-character commentary alone is worth the price of the DVD. I'll spare the reader the easy jokes about &quot;it goes to 11&quot; and the &quot;fine line between clever and stupid&quot; and just recommend this DVD very highly for anyone who needs a guaranteed-to-make-you-laugh comedy.
B00003CXB4|3.0|Fans of THE LION KING will be grateful to own a dvd version of this film, and the pictures and sound are first-rate (seeing the widescreen version at home prompts a greater appreciation for THE LION KING's artistic accomplishment). However, the DVD package itself includes a great deal of material that detracts from one's viewing pleasure. First of all, one HAS to watch a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 parody/preview of yet another LION KING sequel. The discs include low interactivity games, a &quot;virtual safari&quot; that looks like a dry run for a theme park attraction, and a music video by the &quot;Disney Channel 'Circle of Stars'&quot;--the latest generation of Disney studio teen and pre-teen &quot;personalities&quot; in development. The newly animated song, &quot;Morning Report,&quot; disrupts the flow of the scene in which it has now been inserted, and it does little to progress the story except to make Zasu look more like a blithering fool with his cliches and bad puns (thankfully, one has the option to watch the original theatrical version). There are, however, a couple of first-rate extras in the package. It includes the Elton John video of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight,&quot; but, even better, it also includes deleted scenes: an early version of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; (more of Timon and Pumbaa, to Sir Elton's admitted horror), an abandoned scene of &quot;bug football,&quot; and an extra first verse to &quot;Hakuna Matata,&quot; where we find out why Timon is no longer with his meerkat gang (what one calls a group of meerkats). Although the packaging claims an inclusion of something called &quot;Warthog Rhapsody,&quot; I did not find it on the disc. As much as I enjoy watching this film with my children, I wish the Disney Company had given me the option to jump straight to the film instead of being held under an immersive dvd experience, holding my breath until the good stuff starts. Busy families may enjoy the extras, but a movie likely to be played repeatedly requires much more ready access to the main feature than this dvd provides. I would rate the movie itself four and a half stars (before the &quot;Morning Report insertion), if I could, but this dvd package detracts from my viewing experience.ikely to be played repeatedly requires much more ready access to the main feature than this dvd provides.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina killed it!!!! This is the best thing that she's ever done and she showed herself like never before. The vocal arrangements are intelligently intertwined with Christina's beautiful voice.<br />Intro- Basically she's letting everyone know that even though critics and whoever else give her bulls**t, she's going to be herself.  7/10<br />Can't Hold Us Down (feat. Lil Kim)- This song was made to be towards Eminem and Fred Durst.  It's about female empowerment.  9/10<br />Walk Away- The song says it all! My favorite song on the album!  10/10<br />Fighter- I love the rock edge and she shows off her powerful vocals. This song is saying that because of you, I'm better.  I love it.  9/10<br />Primer Amor Interlude- Basically she's speaking in Spanish about the man she loves.  6/10<br />Infatuation- I hated this song at first, but after listening to it may 5 times, it grew on me.  It's about her ex-boyfriend Jorge Santos and how she couldn't help but fall for him.  8/10<br />Love's Embrace Interlude- Beautifully done.  She's saying how she's afraid of love's embrace.  9/10<br />Loving Me 4 Me- WARNING: This is a love song! But it's a beautiful love song.  She's telling the man that she's hooked because he loves her for who she is, not what she has. Another of my favorites.  10/10<br />Impossible- Alicia Keys hooked her up! I couldn't help but fall in love with this song!  10/10<br />Underappreciated- The title says it all. I think all the ladies will be feelin her on this one.  9/10<br />Beautiful- This is one of the best songs on the album. No matter what people say, you know that you are beautiful.  10/10<br />Makeover- Not really into this song, but I listen to it when I don't want to hear people telling me I need to change.  8/10<br />Cruz- I like this song a lot. It deals with leaving to find yourself and live out your dreams.  10/10<br />Soar- Another one of my favorites! The message is simple: never change for anybody and stay true to yourself.  10/10<br />GetMine, Get Yours- What can I say? She kept it all the way live on this one. She's telling the dude that she don't want love, she wants his body!  10/10<br />Dirrty- Who don't know this one! CLUB BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!  10/10<br />Stripped Pt. 2- Just a continuation from the first, but I like this one better.  9/10<br />The Voice Within- Tearjerker!  9/10<br />I'm OK- This song has as much meaning to me as it does to Christina. Cried so hard when I heard this for the first time. She really put her feelings out there with this song.  10/10<br />Keep On Singin' My Song- This song is one of the greatest on the album!  Basically she's saying that no matter what you do to her, she's going to continue to be strong.  10/10<br />Overall, I believe that this will be classic someday. Christina proved that she can sing anything from Rock to Pop to R&amp;B to just pure Soul music. I recommend this CD for anyone who's going thru things or just anyone in general.
0060090367|1.0|Don't bother with this book - it is truly an insult to one's intelligence - I can't beleive this trash was published as a &quot;bestseller&quot;! <br />I had to force myself through it in the hope that one of the numerous (badly timed &amp; totally irrelevant) asides would actually have one iota of humour.<br />You can't sympathize with the main character (or indeed give 2 hoots about ANY of the characters) because they are so transparently paper thin &amp; predictable.<br />Don't waste your time. I know I have. This was a very disappointing offering from a usually quite talented author.
B000001FQ8|1.0|After a decade of fantastic music, of maturing into an accomplished artist capable of both singles and full-length LPs, Mellencamp makes the mistake of too many other &quot;mature&quot; singer-songwriters: he gets @#%#ing boring.  Aside from &quot;Pop Singer&quot;, which still stings with sarcasm, every song on this disc is an overblown attempt at pontificating the obvious.<br />This would be the only time in his career that I doubted JCM's talent.  It did galvanize him, though.  To his credit, he came back hard with his heaviest CD after this country-fied tripe--&quot;Whenever We Wanted&quot; is a gem.  Listening to this CD compared to Uh-Huh shows the obvious fault with the music on Big Daddy; it's just dull and unorganized.  JCM is a wonderful gift to the world of music, but this disc is worthless drivel.  Give it a wide berth.
B000002WYT|5.0|I have had this album for many years and let me tell you now and later this will be one of the greates cds of all time. Dave Matthews Band will go down as one of the best tour bands of all time...5 stars
0440237688|3.0|I think that this was a great book. It kept me on the edge of my seat. When the giver gives Joanas the memory of Joanas sliding down a hill. That was my favorite part. Joans lived id a verry plain world. Ther was no color and pretty much nothing we have today. It would have sucked to be Joanas no GOLF.
B00007LTIC|4.0|Rick Wakeman's return to the group must have inspired Yes to once again stretch themselves away from their normal roads.  The title cut is rock and roll all the way but with Yes' signature wink of the eye attitude to let you know they're never going to play it straight.  Steve Howe's guitar work throughout this album is up to his usual high standard.  And \\"Awaken\\" may be the ultimate Yes song.  The grandeur of the sound and the way they play with the theme and dance around the downbeat towards the end of the piece is pure genius and a joy to indulge in.  Mr. Howe's ending guitar line is absolute beauty.  The whole album exudes an excitement for their art, something I began to find missing more and more often in their later offerings.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Today I put on this album in the back while working on something else, with one detail: I had my headphones on. I was ready for McCartney, so when I heard the title track or &quot;I Do&quot; I felt like I had gotten what I expected from the album. But this production seems to save the best for last. I am not even talking about the popular song (&quot;Freedom&quot;) he performs to close the album, in response to the events of 9/11. What I mean is his works &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; where Indian influences are more than apparent, and mostly &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; a track not suitable for the lighthearted. Over 10 minutes in duration, this song has it all in it (granted that the lyrics are basic and repeated over the course of the entire song): it is an experimental track as in Beatles-experimental.<br />I can see how many reviewers have drawn similarity between this album and The Beatles' 'White Album' -for instance, if &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; where part of that album, it would be part of the more experimental second disc. Long story short, when a musician is coming close to being sixty is still willing to experiment and take bold musical steps, he deserves all our respect, and Paul McCartney did just that with this work when he was 59 years of age.
0385504209|2.0|The book starts out GREAT! Then gets weird for people who are looking for a Christian thriller.  Well writen, but the ending is just not up to the hype.
B0000046JP|5.0|I thought I had loved Aranjuez before I heard this performance. Now I know it was merely a romance with its melodic content. This one performance truly opened to me the meaning of this music. And now all others appear bleak and weak; too refined, too assiduous to reveal what lies beneath the tablature. Just close your eyes and listen carefully how Paco plays solo passages in the glorious Adagio, especially the one before the last orchestral piece. At times his guitar will resemble arabian oud: dark and brooding, then it will suddenly turn to festive, untamed flamenco emotions; what a deep insight into the essence of Spanish music! You don't hear Rodrigo, Paco, Adagio, Guitar or Orchestra here - you're one on one with pure legacy of one of the richest and complex European cultures packed into music with lossless compression.<br />THIS is the spirit of Aranjuez, finally.
0613180771|4.0|&quot;do not be credulous&quot;'s assertions of Japanese innocence aside, Iris Chang writes of the Japanese atrocities with a journalist's skill and the passion of one of the races victimized by the Japanese.  As one of the reviewers of the book, Frederic Wakeman - director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at UC Berkeley - notes, many Japanese have denied that the Rape of Nanking took place and have substituted amnesia for guilt.  I would suspect &quot;do not be credulous's&quot;  poor English and assertion that Chinese committed the atrocities at Nanking and that Chinese were safer in areas controlled by Japanese to be an example of Mr. Wakeman's assertion.  The author has given us a readable - only because of her writing and editing style, NOT because of the facts contained in her book - book of a horrific episode in history.  We owe it to the victims to not forgot what happened to them.
B00009L7N1|5.0|I picked this cd up on a whim because I haven't heard anything out of Mick and his band for quite some time.  It is now the favorite in my collection.  There isn't one song that needs to be skipped over and `Sunrise' is absolutely infectious.  <br />I hope I don't have to wait so long for a follow-up and that sooner or later Simply Red will tour the west side of this country as well!
B000089RVR|4.0|at first listen, i thought this not as good as her debut..but after a few times.i was hooked..its definitely more poetic and subtle than no angel..the big difference i see is that the desperation and anger in dido's voice has been replaced with..dare i say it..an angelic one? thank god for artists like Dido ( fiona apple, tori amos, bjork, and norah jones) from saving us from the mediocrity of mainstream pop music
B0000669JL|5.0|All the greatest hits.  Sounds as fresh as the day it was recorded.  A must for your collection.
B000002UB6|3.0|This is a pretty good album with songs like Two of Us, Get Back and The Long and Winding Road.<br />By the way, everyone is waiting for the stripped-down version to be released in November.  I can't wait either, because it's going to reveal what a GREAT CONTRIBUTION Phil Spector made to the original.
B0000630YA|5.0|I love this Album. Its spooky but it is one my fav albums of all time. Buy this it is worth every bit of the money.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Once again Maynard and APC deliver a jolt of of musical excitement.  Even though this albums guitars tend to sound more like Adam Jones from Tool (which doesn't suck because Tool is the best band in the world), i like the direction the band is going.  This album is more melodic than the first, and slower perhaps, but still focuses on Maynards singing ability- which is second to none.  <BR>    I especially like &quot;The Noose&quot;.  Even though my beliefs are grossly different from the lyrics of this song, I must say that I can look past it.  This song is a perfect 10.<BR>    Buy the album, love the album.  Just dont complain to me if your feelings are hurt because this album is not heavy.  APC is not TOOL.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack best one they done.  All 12 kicks major ass.  Buy this one you'll love it.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is one of the best books I have read. It is extraordinary novel about a stable, pain-free society with no color, music, or feelings. Their world seems perfect with everyone fulfilling their assignments. When Jonas turns twelve, he fills the role of Receiver of Memory. He discovers sights, sounds, and feelings he has never had before, and he cannot share them with the other people. Jonas dicovers that his is not the perfect world and attempts to change it. I recommend this book because it is sure to keep me from taking things for granted.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is the best he has ever done. Well it is probaly one of the best Albums of all time. I've played it around 1000 times or more. I love it.
B000084T18|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out and I love it. I listen to this CD every day because the rhymes are sick and the beats are smooth. I think 50 cent showed the world that he is a dope rapper who can contend with the likes of DRE and Eminem.<br />I recommend this CD to anyone who likes rap, BUY IT!
0060930187|5.0|This novel is fascinating because it is not driven by the usual plot devices writers use to move a story along. The reader is sucked into this book by Sylvia Plath's exquisite narrative voice: her similies are still startling even after so many years, her word choices are flawless, and she is a master at choosing just the right details-- and nothing more to bog down the narrative flow-- that illuminate a scene.<br />The plot has a true ring to me. I suspect that most people who have made it through most of a college program, and must confront the courses and people which they have managed to avoid for many semesters; that, or not finish their program, would feel the same way. I don't think a person must be depressive in order to relate to the malaise of the beginning of the book. By the time things become, well...strange, the reader has already been pulled into Esther's head, and sees events from her perspective. Her depression seems almost inevitable.<br />Beautiful and perfect.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I write this simply out of annoyance more than anything.<BR>I can understand that people don't like this movie, it was not the most creative. I personally liked it mainly because it was a modern twist on one of my favorite stories, no not the matrix as most the people here claim but 1984.<BR>Suppression of original ideas &quot;Big Brother&quot;<BR>Seriously. Don't say that a movie is ripping off the matrix when it ties much more closely to perhaps one of the most influential books in the last century.<br />Back to the movie, nice touch of a utopian society as opposed to a distopia, that brings hints of Brave New World to the story.<BR>The story line was simple, but solid and without, I feel, loose ends.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This movie was well done by director James Mangold. It gives you more action than &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. The main difference in this movie and that movie is that the character the story is centered around is not realistic. Most schizophrenic adults look like normal people not some crazed, twitchy, bugged-eyed psycho killer. That's one knock against the movie. However, the rest of the movie is extremely intriguing. You have to prepare yourself for the beginning, because the movie uses a lot of flashbacks to explain what's going on in that particular scene. <BR>All ten characters are driving out in the middle of nowhere, when this hellacious rainstorm makes their travel impossible. You meet the first couple George and Alice York (John C. McGinley &amp; Leila Kenzle) and their son, Timmy (Bret Loehr). Alice has been hit by a car, which is driven by Ed (John Cusack) who is ferrying a cranky, loquacious movie star  (Rebecca De Mornay)-nice comeback. Alice's carotid artery has been sliced and she is near death, but they can't get to a hospital. They check into this run-down hotel in the middle of nowhere that's run by Larry(John Hawkes)-who has a past of his own. Soon, the torrential downpour brings in a hooker (Amanda Peet), a newlywed couple married for all the wrong reasons and a Nevada cop-(is he or isn't he?)-(Ray Liotta) who is transporting a killer (Jake Busey). My question is why does the cop have a hole in his shirt? Anyway, the prisoner is chained to a toilet, but soon escapes and then the murders start happening. <BR>This movie is more of a suspense thriller than a horror movie, but you know that there is more gruesomeness coming as each minute goes by. Where is the killer? Why is the kid so deathly silent? Why is Larry so jumpy? Why is everybody dying and no one knows why? Are the murder victims linked to each other in some crazy way?<BR>While all of this is going on the plight of crazed serial killer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is being decided in Carson City, Nevada. Malcolm's doctor (Alfred Molina) is trying to plead insanity based on new psychological evidence. I'm not going to tell anymore than what I've just mentioned.<BR>The characters were played exceptionally well by this great cast of actors. John Cusack was great in being the leader of the gang. Rebecca DeMornay was convincing in her PMS, primadonna mode. Ray Liotta is always convincing in the roles that he plays.<BR>The fun part of the movie is figuring out who will die next and why are they dying and what brought them to this rundown hotel. Was it coincidence or was it fate? It gets a little sloppy at the end, but all in all this is a good thriller. I'm still trying to figure out some parts of it. I'll probably watch it again. Yep, it's one of those movies. Watch and enjoy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm betting you all know about the movie so I'm writing about the love I have for the Extended Editions of this trilogy. For the consumer who gets screwed by multiple editions of their favorite movie and becomes afraid to purchase the initial release, this is a fine example of how it should be done. The producers let you know in advance that their will be the theatrical version and the extended version so you may choose. Also, the extras aren't re-used so that even if you do buy both you likely won't be sorry. The devotion, love, delight, dedication and thoroughly detailed production of these films is overwhelming and this extensive collection proves it! It leaves no stone unturned in every aspect of creating the movie. The extras are longer than the movie! :) It's a MUST-OWN!
B00009RDG9|1.0|I will first say that I love action films. However, this action film almost put me to sleep. I spent the entirety of the movie anticipating the end. This movie is sporadic, there's no script whatsoever, and this has got to be one of the worst performances by Tommy Lee Jones (not as bad as Men In Black-terrible movie) that I can remember. Benecio Del Toro can't save this movie in any way. Tommy Lee didn't get much help with the script, so that's why his performance wasn't that good. You have a specially trained agent who goes haywire and starts killing people, but it never explains why he went crazy in the first place. What triggered this behavior?..I don't know. Come to find out, Tommy Lee's character actually trained this guy and now is the only person that can stop him. The movie was only an hour and a half long, but it was pretty excrutiating. It almost bored me to tears. Please don't buy this movie. You'll hate yourself for it.
B00009ATIX|5.0|About the only &quot;problems&quot; I have with this film are:<BR>1) I've grown accustomed to longer films.  This one feels longer than it is, however.  From the commentary, apparently a lot of this film was cut.<BR>2) Personally I would have liked to have seen SOME specific discussion as to the location of the planet and the propulsion systems invloved in getting there ( although that stuff admittedly isn't the point of the film ).  As a storytelling device, the film is seemingly set in the &quot;near future&quot; ( complete with the constant rain and corresponding streetwear from Blade Runner ); the urban yuppie scenes are mostly indistinguishable from the actual present, and how interstellar travel has been developed is a mystery.  Unless Solaris is supposed to be in the outer reaches of our own system, which I doubt.  To summarize, the film mixes a relatively familiar Earthscape with interstellar human travel, which realistically is a **LONG** way off if it's even going to happen at all.<BR>3) In a later part of the film the music seems to be almost a direct ripoff of the music used in the 2001 Stargate sequence. Hopefully this was done as a homage, not based on the theory of &quot;these idiots don't remember 2001.&quot;<BR>Overall, this movie is very cool, and benefits from a modern Soderbergh-esque cinematography.
B00009TB5G|5.0|After seeing the \\"Fellowship\\" I though, this is the best movie ever.  I knew they would have to kick some butt in order to make the \\"Two Towers\\" even better, and they did.  I just hope \\"Return of the King\\" suprpasses them all.
B000065U1N|4.0|Not boring and it shows how USA can't do it all for the 3rd world.<BR>Good acting,good action ,very real and alive!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Whoa, that's how I sum up this album.  I actually was completely caught off guard by the release of this album (I had no idea it was coming). I am a huge Engima fan since day I and was completely blown away by this album.  It is by and large the most unique album of the bunch as it shares few aspects from the others---though still is excellent.  Cretu is a master and has modernized the sound of Enigma while still retaining the mysterious, sensual aura of the earlier works.  The only flaw that I saw with the album was not using Sandra's voice more often--that and the fact that it seems way short (in the same way that MCMXC did).  Overall an excellent album and a must for any Enigma fan! Oh, one final thought, the unique case design was awsome!
B00005JKZV|2.0|Hopefully the extended edition will go miles to improve this poorly edited, sappy, confusing film. The Two Towers picks up right where Fellowship of the Ring ended and seemingly rushes to the ending credits as fast it can, leaving any sense of poignancy or emotion in the dust. Sure, there's lot's of sappy close-ups of terrified children and lovelorn faces -- but it means nothing because there was no time for anything resembling development. Perhaps there is no finer example of this false emotion than the &quot;heroic&quot; death of Haldir. He is supposed to represent an alliance that men and elves once shared, thus rendering his death tragic. But he is nothing in these films. His lines were few, his presense weak. Why should I care? Indeed, even Helms Deep suffers from this lack of resonance. It's eye-candy, to be sure, but where is the gut-wrenching mood? Where is the suspense??? Of course the disasterous idea to cut back and forth between the Ents and the battle does't help. Then there is the ridiculous, time wasting &quot;death&quot; of Aragorn. You've got to be kidding. It's so cheap and it merely distracts. We should have had more interaction between Sam, Frodo, and Gollum. But no. King Theoden's cheezball possession/exorcism sequence only begs questions. The FX, widely praised, are not so much terrible as they just look, well, unfinished. The wargs are a perfect example. The Ents come across as cartoonish, not majestic. And that was a mistake. Even Gollum is a hit and miss. Sometimes he works, sometimes he looks terrible. Combine all of this with a sloppy, underwhelming ending, and you have a vastly inferior film.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is the best album released since... oh, since &quot;No Code&quot; in 1996 - Pearl Jam is god, get this album, itll rock your socks off<br />Pearl Jam forever
B000066NW0|1.0|ok first things first....avril lavigne is NOT punk. ok? got it? good. second of all she doesnt write her own lyrics. i personally dont even think the matrix is all that good. I mean, c'mon people the Matrix wrote lyrics for Hilary Duff. How low can you get when your writing lyrics for a disney channel drop-out? next...she cant even play her own instruments. I mean maybe I would respect her is she could play bass or drums or guitar or sumthing...but she doesnt. She just holds the guitar in poses for pictures. Thats all avril lavigne can do; pose. If your just listening to the cd, youd think she has amazing range and a uniquelly talented voice. Yeah, just turn on the tv and see one of her live performances. You wont make it through 5 seconds, trust me. The only lyrics I could relate to at all on the song were &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; which i'll admit is catchy and pretty sound, lyrically. This definately is a CD i would keep on constant rotation in my walkman. So if your looking for a good punk rock cd...go get Sum 41.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam are legendary gods, they are to the 90s what the Beatles were to the 60s - theyre the most important &amp; influential band of the past 20 years &amp; this album proves why they are, you better buy this album or youre missing out so badly - this is one of the greatest albums ever
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma has always been a huge inspiration to me. Being a world-fusion artist myself, I always eagerly await Micheal's new releases. I think this album has definately shifted into unexplorered territory in the genre - especially the usage of breaks often used in Drum 'n Bass. Needless to say, Enigma has once again failed to dissapoint me.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This is easily the greatest album ever made, the only albums that come close are 'Vitalogy' &amp; 'No Code', but other than that, definitely the greatest album of all time, Pearl Jam are not just gods, or legends, theyre legendary gods

B0000AQVCL|4.0|After the huge hype that came following the Dirty Sweet EP that was released last year, Jet had a lot to live up to.  With Get Born they prove that the hype was justified.<br />Get Born is not the type of album that is going to completely blow you away.  But what it does is blow away 90% of the bands that have been coming out of the Garage Revolution scene.  What they do extremely well is pull off the retro sound without making it seem forced.  Get Born also showcases a beautiful mix of hard rockers and ballads.  Some will criticize the fact that about a third of the album is set around acoustic guitars and pianos, but most will take it as a great display of musical depth.  Where most rock albums suffer from awful ballads, Jet succeeds with songs that don't sound forced and suck you right into the overall mood.  Ballads like Look What You've Done, Move On, Radio Song, and Come Around Again are the perfect complements to hard rockers like Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Rollover DJ, Get What You Need and Cold Hard B****.  <br />All in all, Jet puts out an extremely respectable debut album and one that should not be missed by any rock fan.  Complaints?  Get Born sure doesn't break down any barriers, and sometimes the boys seem a bit too ACDC/Guns N Roses for their own good.  These are only small complaints, though, and should not prevent anybody from buying this excellent album.

037542217X|5.0|In this book, Smith's 4th and most recent book in the &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series, he tackles again some of his usual topics.  He again shows the constant battle between traditional values and modern values and their interaction in Botswana.<br />However, in this book, Smith goes even further than he has before.  He engages in conveying the ability of people to self-empower themselves.  In this book, Smith illuminates the continual problem of a male dominated society and how this situation affects the women of Botswana.  Throughout the book, there are multiple examples of the women of Botswana self-empowering, and feeling the tremendous elation and self-satisfaction that accompanies that accomplishment.  Starting particularly with Mma Makutsi, Assistant Detective, who starts a business teaching MEN how to type.  And it is an immediate success, as men often feel internal cognitive dissonance that they cannot type for themselves, and have to depend on women to do their typing.  The concept of the class itself is self-empowerment for men.  And the business itself allows Mma Makutsi to feel self-empowered herself, the proprietor of a successful business.<br />While the books are &quot;plugged&quot; as &quot;mystery/fiction&quot; most readers of the &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series recognize, that the cases, the investigations, are really just a device to advance the plot and to help illustrate the points which mostly deal with ethics, morality and how people treat each other.  This is truly what Smith is trying to get across and by using Botswana, a small, proud, independent, Democratic country as a microcosm of the world, he tries to help the reader understand cross cultural issues and basic ethical concepts which are slightly different in each venue, but are nonetheless, universal around the world.<br />Smith gives us yet again, a close look at the internal workings of another society and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions as to how it relates to the world they live in themselves.  Truly a wonderful and instructive series, this book deserves the 5 star rating.usions as to how it relates to the world they live in themselves.

B000070WJE|5.0|I have been a fan of Robbie's since i saw his Slane Castle concert televised 3 years ago. He is an amazing performer and song writer. Give this cd a try! It is incredible. His tongue in cheek lyrics on Monsoon and World's Most Handsome Man are typical Robbie. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE give Robbie a try! We want more Robbie in the US!
0385504209|4.0|I really liked this book, but there have been enough positive reviews that I will not be able to contribute anything that hasn't already been said, so I will comment on where I think this book needed a little more work.<br />I wasn't as engulfed from the start as many reader's have stated.  I thought the first 100 or so pages were very slow at best.  The book starts off with Sauniere being murdered and with little time left, leaves many symbolic messages in the museum that need to be decoded due to the high security needed for the keystone, you would think the same security or even a little more would be needed for the golden KEY to this stone, nope, just WRITE the address on the key is good enough.  My only guess is that he got tired of coming up with codes and puzzles protecting this key all his life, he wanted a few minutes of peace as he lay dying.<br />Our buddy Dan Brown seemed to be reaching in some parts of the book.  I mean come on, I can buy the whole Jesus was married, the Catholic religion is based on other religions, and the Vatican will spare no expense to keep the truth hidden, but to claim Walt Disney is a pagan worshipper because he made cartoons like Snow White and Cinderilla is just a little tough to believe.<br />And Sophie (the cryptogopher).  Who is giving this girl a job?!  I've seen tougher puzzles on a box of apple jacks that this girl couldn't crack.  Seemed like she was only any help by giving input relating to childhood games she would play with her grandpa. Surely the French have higher standards than that when seeking new law officers.<br />The villian, Teabing, isn't the smartest bad guy in the bunch either.  As our 3 heros are on their quest to find and unearth holy grail (exactly what the villian wants) he starts shooting up the place and gets arrested, I mean, why not wait until you've found the grail or at least the map before making a big scene.<br />But seriously, I liked the book. Great read, it picks up, you just have to play along.  The Da Vinci messages were by far the best parts of the book!along.  The Da Vinci messages were by far the best parts of the book!
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Wow this movie is downright funny i do not recomend it for young viewers because it is really vulgar. but man is it funny there is almost no plot. just a bunch of jokes. A bunch of kids r being killed by a guy in the scream costume. Eventually u find out who it is that does it and it is kinda a dumb ending but man is it funny its a good movie to watch with ur firends noot a family movie.
0446530891|3.0|A potentially interesting story that gets bogged down with way too many characters.  If you decide to buy this book also consider buying a legal pad so you can keep track of the players.
0671027344|5.0|I have to say, before i read this book, i didn't have a favorite book. I have one now. I have read this book over 5 times, and it has the same effect on me still.  I think i may be in love with the main character, Charlie.  I relate to this book, being in the whole highschool scene myself, and it baffles me how stephen chbosky portrays it all so accuratly, and with such truth.  I can imagine everyone of these characters vividly.  I feel like i know all these people, and maybe one of these days i will find a charlie.  this book is written in a style of innocence, i think. maybe it is just an ironic mask for what is really going on in the book. you can not get bored with this book.  every page, every letter (if you are put off by this format in a book, don't be, you can hardly remember its written in letter-form at all), is a small story, and all written with the same amount of intricate observation.<br />It is beautiful.

0780622553|5.0|Okay, so there are lots of reviews here, you pretty much know the story. I was lucky enough to see this film in theaters; I was completely blown away by it. Unfortunately, since almost no one saw this film in theaters, Proyas' career tanked.<br />This is no hyperbole: this is the greatest film I have ever seen. Yes, I like dark films, great production design, which many have noted; however, it is my opinion that the reason  many people vomitted on this film, complaining about lack of character depth, bad acting, thin plot, is that they did not GET IT. The film is a reflection on what and who we are. I'm not going to explain everything this means, since there is so much the director is saying that I could make a thesis out of it.<br />Just understand this. This is not a film for everybody. You must be ready to accept that this is not a conventional movie. Every time I have watched this film (I have it on VHS, later on DVD), there is a new interpretation that comes to mind, and I must've watched this over 20 times; I've noted 8 interpretations so far, plus many variations.<br />I love the visual storytelling. There is a scene where the hero kisses his wife after psychicly shattering the sheet of glass that separates them, expressing visually that he really does love her, and that love is not something implanted, or so it seems. %%SPOILER%% At the end, when the hero creates Shell Beach, and creates the first sunrise on the dark city, it was such a moving experience, that I, a serious, firmly heterosexual grown man, had actually wept upon seeing the sunrise. And I still do nearly every time I see that scene. Why? Because here is a man who, having vanquished his [inner] demons, is now making his own destiny, and creating his world according to his wishes. He is not a god, he is a free man, which is everything (now that's one interpretation). %%END SPOILER%%<br />There are many more such scenes where the storytelling is done visually. Add to that a striking score, and you've got loads of non-verbal story going on here. The film only seems thin because it's characters are significantly muted.<br />Don't expect the film to give you all the answers, since, as any good film, it doesn't have them. However, it should lead you to reflect on who and what you are. Are you your own man, or are you just the sum of your randomly acquired experiences? Are you born evil, or can you be educated to act evil? Do we as people have an essence that goes beyond our memories and our genes? Why does everybody care so much about the city being dark all the time if they have no memory of ever seeing the sun?
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I bought this CD a week ago, and I was initially disappointed.  Unlike Greek Song, Poses and Grey Gardens from his previous release, there were no cuts that made me want to hit the \\"repeat\\" button.  But I gave it another chance, and another...  Now it's the only CD in my player. I hear snippets of these beautiful songs in my head everywhere - while watching a movie, during staff meetings, before drifting off to sleep...  There isn't a single weak song, but the standouts are Vicious World, Beautiful Child, Dinner at Eight and the title track.  Lush, complex, ethereal, and poignant tunes - Want One has it all.  I feel sorry for those who say, \\"Rufus WHO??,\\" when I gush about the best thing that's happened to music this year.
B0000029DD|2.0|When I bought this CD, the only song I'd ever heard Buckley sing was &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;  Naturally, I was enthralled by Buckley's incredibly expressive falsetto--he really does make that track a religious experience.  What I was not prepared for was the application of that same technique to every song Buckley sang.  When I first listened to this CD, I felt like his rendition of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was cheapened: he hadn't adapted his voice to the demands of that particular song, but simply poured his old formula into a particularly suitable mould.  I don't mean to disrespect a late legend, but Buckley's impressive voice quickly loses its luster because of his disappointing lack of versatility.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|At this point, there's no need for me to summarize the plot of this much-revered gangster epic by Brian DePalma.  Chances are, you've already seen this movie, and if you haven't, then you know somebody else who has.  What I WILL discuss is the DVD, which I have been anxiously awaiting for at least a couple years.  I bought \\"Scarface\\" during my lunch break from the office and waited impatiently for the day to end so I could rush home and watch it later that evening.  As most of you all know, \\"Scarface\\" was originally released many years ago on DVD, but was slammed by many for its terrible picture quality and crummy sound.  It got yanked out of print, and now a 2-disc version has been re-released for its 20th anniversary.  So, how's the picture?  It's not flawless, but it certainly looks impressive for a 1983 film.  The colors are rich and the picture delivers a fairly sharp image throughout.  I didn't notice that many print flaws; however, the darker scenes were a bit fuzzy at times.  Regardless, Universal redeemed itself in a big way and did a very good job fixing this picture.  The sound, however, is my sole disappointment.  I own a five-channel system, and most of the sound came from the center speaker.  Even the shootings (and there are several) came from the center!  This is particularly upsetting, considering that \\"Scarface\\" is a very loud and action-packed film.  In fact, the main occasion where the sound moved to the front and rear channels is during Giorgio Moroder's chessily synthetic 1980's score.  Quite simply, the remastering didn't always allow the sound to utilize all five speakers as it should have.  It would have been nice if the sound moved to the surrounding speakers during the more action-oriented scenes.  I know this is nitpicking, but I am a royal pain when it comes to these details.  However, the second disc of supplements is an attractive package.  It has a few documentaries including interviews with, among others, DePalma, Al Pacino, and Oliver Stone (who wrote the script).  There's also another documentary that covers the movie's influence on hip hop culture, featuring interviews with P. Diddy, Eve, Snoop Dogg, Russell Simmons, and, yep, the Geto Boy Scarface himself.  This clip has prompted some interesting responses from viewers, and others turn their nose at it, asking \\"What does 'Scarface' have to do with hip hop?\\"  Well, here's my $.02 on this matter.  If you don't like hip hop, that's fine.  But only an ignorant fool would deny the clear and obvious connection between this film and gangsta rap.  Like many rappers, Tony Montana had a tough background, overcame adversity, and quickly climbed his way to be one of the baddest thugs in the business.  It is mainly this reason why \\"Scarface\\" survived its box office failure and grew to be an underground classic.  But hip hop connections or not, this movie is a hugely entertaining film with an explosive performance by Al Pacino.  It isn't perfect, but it's vivid, incredibly outrageous, and invites multiple viewings.  Even though the DVD's sound leaves much for improvement, \\"Scarface\\" gets the green light from me.  Buy this movie and reunite yourself with \\"your little friend.\\"er Stone (who wrote the script).

B00009RDG9|5.0|I watched this movie in the thearthe and it totally caught my eye. I then had to buy it on DVD. Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro are two great actors. If your into action and thriller movies this is the movie to buy.

B000092ZYX|5.0|ANyone who did not give this record a 5 star rating is full of crap. This is what quality music is. Great Alternative Rock music by one of the best present band with astounding vocals by THom Yorke. Man...this album (despite the political connotations) is just plain off the chain. WhoA!
0380977788|5.0|Absolutely gripping book as i finished reading it in one go. Gaiman has done it again with his dark imaginative stories and this book is a must in any collection. While reading it, the story kept me imagining things and it feels like you're there watching Coraline. It gets so scary at one time, that i actually threw the book down and get a grip. What makes the book even better and give you a feel of this story is through Dave Mckean's illustration. These two are classic partners. It's fantastic and this story would make a good movie. I bet any children would get terrible nightmares by reading it.
B000096FUD|2.0|Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, and quite fond of Terry Gilliam works (I even like The Adventures of Baron Van Moonchild) I was very much looking forward to getting this DVD, once I had finished watching it however I was terribly dissapointed.  I am going into acting and though I would like to see a movie about the process, but not enough happened during the actual making of the film to credit a 'making of' or even an 'unmaking of' movie.  If the production of 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' had lasted more than an week the documentary might have been able to stand on its own, but as it is I think it should have been saved to release with Terry Gililam's final version, even if they had to wait another couple of decades.
B00004Z459|1.0|I bought this album when it was first released because I heard it was good. After listening to it once, I burned it(with flames not a CD burner). This album is a disgrace to music. The lyrics are stupid and the instruments suck. Linkin Park's new stuff sucks as well. Don't waste your money.

B00000JMQE|5.0|Return To Oz is such an underrated sequel to The Wizard Of Oz. Being a child of the 80's I can honestly say that I watched this movie over and over again and can remember going with my parents to see it in the theater when I was 5 years old and being utterly frightened, enthralled and just blown away by this fantasy adventure film. The movie is one of the most dark and haunting childrens films out there. I was babysitting a year ago and put this on for a 3 year old little girl and a 7 year old little boy and had bad results from them-They were freaked out<br />(especially When mombie's head opened her eyes and howls \\"DOROTHY GALE!\\" in rage) and I had to turn the movie off...so, this isnt a movie I would recomend to young children who arent used to seeing creepy images (The wheelers might just torment a kids nightmares for months after seeing this)...But, this truly is an epic classic that many 80's kids will probably say was one of there favorites alongside Labyrinth and Goonies while growing up. This film is visually stunning. The character depictions are point on. People who are complaining that this movie does THE WIZARD OF OZ (starring Judy Garland) need to realize that Frank L. Baum would have been more proud of this film than the Judy Garland musical. OZ was never intended to be a musical, entirely happy, technicolor dream world. Baum's OZ was a place where a lot of nightmarish things happened, and this version is true to those plotlines. This movie meshes two of Baum's novels (The Land of Oz, and Ozma of Oz) and it does an amazingly accurate translation of the books. Dorothy is finally a little girl, unlike Judy Garland, who was in her late teens when she played Dorothy. There are some truly horrific moments in this movie too. Mombie is pure evil. Her makeup effects make her look like a crazed glam rocker from the 70's, and that is VERY scary to look at. The best part of the movie though, of course, are the character friendships that develope as the journey to save OZ begins. Jack Pumpkinhead is a childlike stick figure with a huge pumpkin on his head. He yearns for one thing, his mother, and that is something viewers can instantly relate to. Tick Tock is the protector we all need and want at times. He is loyal to Dorothy and would do anything to help her. Bellina is the smart and sassy chicken who comes along for the ride after being swept from her chicken coop. She has some of the best one liners in the movie! People will also love The Gump, who is a flying couch that the companions built to escape Mombie's prison tower. This is a dark and beautiful movie that is worthy of only praise. I guess people will either love it or hate it, but I prefer this darker side of the rainbow than the technicolor sugar-fest predecessor that is untrue to Baum's writings.ave OZ begins.

B00009ATIX|2.0|At his best, Steven Soderbergh is a high-art director of  straight genre films - his creative-yet-pragmatic editing and camera tricks elevated &quot;Out of Sight,&quot; &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;Traffic&quot; above straight popcorn; his work in &quot;Traffic&quot; was particularly impressive considering the material had been tread and retread for 15 years. <br /> But there is the other side of bizarre and inexplicable failures, like &quot;Schizopolis&quot; and inane &quot;Full Frontal.&quot; &quot;Solaris&quot; belongs on that team of Soderbergh's films that has intentions beyond the genre audience, and unlike Soderbergh's &quot;sex, lies and videotape&quot; no provocation to tempt them along. It could one of the more beautifully shot films you'll see, with a dark, lush look worth swimming in, but it is minimalist and spare, stiff when it should be touching, and tremendously boring.<br /> The movie's title refers to a planet in the future, a ball of energy and water, with the capacity to react and manipulate human emotions, specifically that of a science crew sent to research it. Another scientist, Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is sent to the ship after a member of it requests him. Kelvin discovers a room of dead bodies and the planet's powerful relationship with the remaining crew, a skittish, tic-filled technogeek (Jeremy Davies) and a stern, scared-alive captain (Viola Davis). <br />His first night he is visited by his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone); the planet, it seems, culls memories from its human subjects and presents them, in the flesh, slightly altered. Just how is for you to discover, but those alterations tear the initially grateful Kelvin in two directions. Hashing out those inner demons accounts for much of the picture. &quot;Solaris&quot; reveals an intriguing reality about the tenets and boundaries of memory, but it, like the rest of the movie, is an understatement to some mood Soderbergh never plugs us into.<br />This is not Clooney's finest moment. Best when he's smooth and smirking, Clooney is called upon for anguish for his dead wife, and he can't produce anything more than a lilted voice and painful wincing. McElhone, if mysterious and stunning, is equally cold. Passions lacking, the main thrust of &quot;Solaris&quot; is lost, and the blue planet is nothing more than a special f/x outside the window. <br />The movies erects a giant, pale edifice to art form of passing time, its camera tracking behind Clooney from empty room to empty room, no discernible goal awaiting, in between several long scenes of Davies affecting some mild version of Tourette's syndrome. Viola Davis, for her part, is very good, suggesting a gathering, palpable threat that never comes to head. Soderbergh holds his cards close as if to deliver a late-in-the-game salvo that substantiates the buildup; what he does deliver is an incoherent &quot;transformation&quot; sequence that cannot be entirely explained on first viewing. So it never will be.<br />James Cameron produced the film, which makes sense: No other way is $60 million offered to such a repressed, calculated remake of Russian filmmaker Sergei Tarkovsky's 1972 film, widely hailed as a (very long) classic but no bowl of jelly itself. &quot;Solaris&quot; is product of three Hollywood heavyweights with limitless line of credit and artsy romantic leanings, and the end result is an abstract product that will fail the main litmus test for most viewers - is it entertaining? - and for the others who eat this material up, may they paint the town blue.
B000099T2L|3.0|I bought this CD because I really liked Crazy In Love.  I should have listened to the whole thing before I bought it.  I only liked three songs and they are right at the beginning, though I do like the song called Daddy which pushed her rating up to three stars.  She did do a lot of whispering which got to be annoying.  It did not display the talent that I know she has got to have.
0783225970|5.0|Scarface has to be one of the best flicks i've seen.  This movie has awesome characters built up to make you understand where they were comming from. An amazing line up of stars that are now what one would call super stars. Highly recomended if you like the whole mob gangster scene.
0380729407|5.0|I've always considered this book to be the dark companion to Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success.<br />  Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds....<br />  This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar.<br />  This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?
B0000028P8|5.0|The critics were having a whale of a time saying that Mariah Carey was simply an ordinary girl with studio magic, so she set out to prove them wrong with her first live set on MTV Unplugged in 1992. She proved them wrong beyond belief, and the world stood in awe of Mariah Carey and her absolutely astonishing vocal range. Mariah said she felt extremely close to the audience when singing the songs because it was such an intimate setting, and this shows in her posture and body language in the live footage of the show. MTV Unplugged EP includes just seven songs by Mariah Carey, and are the songs that put her on the map to become one of the biggest female stars in history.<br /><br />The album starts with Mariah's huge US No.1 single \\"Emotions\\" from her second album of the same name. The crowd cheers and the backing singers sing in unison as Mariah prepares herself. Suddenly, like a bolt of lightening, Mariah belts out the first verse of the song and we're on our way. Mariah makes a big impression on this first song, and the band is equally fantastic. Mariah then slows it down with the fantastic \\"If It's Over\\" from her second album. This ballad showcases Mariah Carey's legendary vocals perhaps more than any other song she has ever recorded. It's a ballad with heavy backing vocals and strong instruments, in a very gospel kind of way. Aretha would be proud! \\"Someday\\" is up next, and the backing singers open it wonderfully, as the beat grows and Mariah finally starts singing. This song was also a big US No.1 single for Mariah, and was taken from her debut album.<br /><br />The album continues with Mariah's signature ballad, and her debut single, the huge US No.1 single from 1990 \\"Vision Of Love.\\" This ballad is a true classic in every sense of the word and Mariah really makes a big impact with her vocals on this song. Absolutely fantastic. \\"Make It Happen\\" is up next, and the tempo rises with this classy slice of R'n'B pop. Catchy melodies and similar vocal arrangements make this song a classic, and one that you can listen to over and over again. \\"I'll Be There\\" is perhaps the song that everyone knows this album for. The song was just sang on the show with Trey Lorenz (one of Mariah's life-time friends), and was later released as a single due to massive public appeal. The song peaked at No.2 in the UK and was Mariah's biggest hit in the country to date, but it went one better and stormed to No.1 in the US. The cover of the Jackson 5 classic bagged Lorenz a recording deal, and became an instant Mariah classic. The album ends on a high with the classic ballad \\"Can't Let Go.\\" This is quite possibly my favourite Mariah Carey ballad ever, because it sounds so classic and epic. The song has some wonderful verses, and Mariah's vocals are absolutely awesome - when are they ever not?!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />If you're just getting into Mariah Carey's music then I'd recommend the albums \\"Emotions,\\" \\"Music Box,\\" \\"Daydream,\\" \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Charmbracelet.\\" These are Mariah's five greatest albums in my opinion, but for those who are looking to venture further afield you need \\"MTV Unplugged EP\\" in your collection now! This album has sold around 7 million copies worldwide, which is a far cry from the 20 million + sales of some of her later albums, but this is a cute and adorable little set of ballads and up-tempo numbers in an intimate set - perfect for Mariah's true fans and those who appreciate really great live music.assic, and one that you can listen to over and over again. \\"I'll Be There\\" is perhaps the song that everyone knows this album for.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|This movie was okay but it's not even half as good as the first movie. The writers just went too overboard with the special effects and the action. The acting and dialogue suffered from this and it was obvious. The Matrix really made you think. Matrix Reloaded doesn't. The characters (with the exception of the pilot and his wife) seem like robots that don't really show any emotion. They are really very different from the way they were in part one. The writers have made Neo so invincible and God-like that you never really worry about him at all. This movie would have been worse if it did not have such a great ending. This movie was pretty good on it's own and it is worth buying but it is really lousy if you compare it to part one. I have faith that \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" will be better.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|As one of the legions of TULL fans in the UK who have in recent years been starved of TULL activity (no TULL tour for 2 years, and only 1 RUBBING ELBOWS gig from Ian Anderson for the whole of the country), I have been enjoying the recent flurry of recording activity with the Anderson/Barre releases (both excellent!), and now the dreaded JETHRO TULL CHRISTMAS ALBUM.........<BR>I'm sure many fans will approach this new release with trepidation: &quot;WE WANT A BONA-FIDE TULL ALBUM, NOT A STOP-GAP CHEESY FESTIVE OFFERING WITH THE BAND JUST BANGING OUT RE-RECORDINGS THAT WON'T BE AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS, PLUS A FEW FLUTE RENDERINGS OF TRADITIONAL CAROLS  TO FILE UNDER 'MUZAK'&quot;, I hear them cry......<BR>Well, I'm here to tell anyone not yet bold enough to purchase this latest offering to FEAR NOT!!!....Ian Anderson and the band (plus assorted guests) have produced a fine album, which won't just be confined to a few plays during the festive season, and will sit proudly with the best of TULLS considerable back catalogue: particularly alongside the more acoustic/folk influenced era of SONGS FROM THE WOOD AND HEAVY HORSES....<BR>Christmas, has been a theme that has popped up with regularity over the years in Ian Andersons songwriting , so it seems to me logical that a full TULL album exploring this subject be released. Ian Anderson has too much integrity to just bang-out any old product, just to cash in on the season/squeeze a few more bucks from the die-hards out there: the re-recordings of older TULL songs are top-notch, the new songs all sit proudly with the best of TULLS/ANDERSONS recent output, and his dexterity on the flute makes the renditions of tradition festive faves much more than the mere 'MUZAK' of so many other Christmas albums.....and Mr. Andersons vocals are by and large a real revelation, recalling the halcyon days of &quot;FESTIVAL HAIR&quot;, COD-PIECES, AND THE DREADED &quot;CONCEPT ALBUM&quot;!!!!!<BR>Even my good pal TONY, a fully fledged TULL-O-PHOBE of many years standing (begrudingly) likes it......<BR>GIVE YOURSELF AN EARLY CHRISTMAS TREAT AND PURCHASE IT NOW!!!!!!!
B00005JKZV|1.0|I have the Lord of the Rings trilogy of books. I have them but I have never read them so I can't tell you if the movies are accurate or not. I can tell you, however, that I don't like the Two Towers movie. The book might be good but the movie sure isn't. I saw &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and I loved it. I saw &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and I hated it. What the heck happened? The movie was just TOO dark in comparison to &quot;The Fellowship&quot; and none of the characters really seemed likable anymore. The acting was also really bad which is a shock if you consider how great it was in part one. Everyone just phoned in their performances. I was really looking forward to The Two Towers and I was really let down. There is only one good scene in the movie and that does not occur until the end of the film. The scene that I speak of is the &quot;Samwise speech&quot; scene. His words of advice are really great and they are what Frodo needs to hear in his darkest moment. This scene is really good and it is really touching to see friends work things out but it does not redeem this movie in any way.<br />I hope the book is better than the movie and I hope the next movie is better than this one. I also hope that we see less of Gollum. I have no idea why there are so many Gollum fans out there. Gollum is whiny and he is gross to look at it.
6304014457|5.0|I have owned a video copy of this film for years.  I first saw Das Kabinet des Dr. Caligari, and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie des Grauns when I was 12.  About the same time I saw the second Golem movie of the early 1920's by Paul Wegener.  I really enjoy the Dr Caligari movie, and prefer to think of the ending not as being a happy one, that the sick Francis would be cured by the kindly Dr. Caligari, but that he had been captured, and probably tortured in sequences after the film ends.  One could imagine something like Orlac's Hande. Conrad Veidt's, Ceasar, supposedly influnced the 1930's Frankenstein films by Universal, and certainly started that so common scene of the monster kidnapping the heroine.  But I think that influence was overstated.  Veidt was more influential, I think, in the scenes in the Cabinet.  That was a prototype for similar vampire scenes that would come in the future.  This and the silent movie The Man Who Laughs put him in the running to play Dracula after Lon Chaney died, but before the stage Dracula--Bela Lugosi--was hired.  Of course Veidt makes the most polished Nazi ever in Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart, Claude Reins, and Ingrid Bergman.  The figure of Cesare was even aped by Peter Murphey on his first solo album.  However, unlike some of your reviewers I consider Anne Rice's books or movies a waste of my time.
B00005JM0B|3.0|This movie (like ALL the Terminator movies,) is really good as long as you don't think about. I saw a TON of bad reviews for T3 on IMDB.com and I can see where some of these fans are coming from in many ways. I agree that it is too similar to T2 in may ways but I have trouble with fans that dislike T3 for continuity contradictions. Every Terminator movie has big contradictions. I think I hate the Terminator movies as much as I love them if I really stop and think about them. If you stop and think about them none of them would make any sort of sense. These two questions proove my point.<BR>#1.How could John Conner stop Judgement Day and still manage to exist?<BR>#2. Humans built the Terminators from their remains in the present. Wouldn't they cease to exist if they were able to kill John Conner before he becomes a great leader?<br />You have to sort of shut your mind down and focus on the cool characters if you want to enjoy the Terminator films. You can't expect a story that will make sense and you can't expect good continuity. This rule will also always apply to any sort of Highlander movie or series. It is good as long as you don't think about it very much.<br />T3 is really good even though it is like T2. I think that it is interesting that fans thought T3 was a copy of T2. I saw it as a odd tribute to T1 & T2. The plot was like T2 but the evil Terminator's cold killing style (the knock on your door and shoot style,) was similar to the original T-800's killing style. I enjoyed T3 for the great action and the good characters but I also enjoyed it for it's message at the end: \\"The future may not be set but destiny is inevitable.\\" This message really adds a unique twist to \\"the future is not set\\" moral that is in Terminator and Terminator 2.<br />I disagree with anyone that says that the ending of this film leaves the story open for a sequel. It really doesn't. How could it? The war of the machines was pretty much beginning by the end of the film. There would be nopoint in sending any Terminators back in time if the war was already on.<BR>Watch this movie if you love Terminator but don't think about it too much or you will hate it.
0394800184|5.0|Are You My Mother? is one of the classic children's books, like Pokey Little Puppy or Green Eggs and Ham. It is a wonderfully simple book full of love. It belongs on your required reading shelf.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This prooves that a sequel can be better than the original. X-2 really improves on the first film and it finally gives us the Wolverine that we have seen in the comic book. Hugh Jackman did a fine job in the first film but he didn't really fight as well as Wolverine did in the comic. It was great to see him cut threw his opponents with such ease in this film because it makes him more like the comic book Wolverine that we alll loved and admired as kids.<br />The acting and the story were great. I thought the Phoenix/Dark Phoenix Saga hint at the end was cool but I was hoping they would save that story for X4 or X5. I really can't wait to see Gambit in X3. I hope the rumors are true that Christian Kane from TV's \\"Angel\\" will play Gambit. Gambit was the only thing that was missing from this film.<br />Please give us a different villain in X3. I always love Magneto but I would like to see the X-men face the Sentinels or a new villain. I hope the Hellfire Club or the Shadow King can appear in one of the next X-men films because they are good villains. The Brood would also be cool.<br />Buy this if you love the X-men and be sure to look for the weird \\"Wrath of Khan\\" Similarities.
6305949980|5.0|Move over Rudolph &amp; Santa Clause is Coming to Town. We Love Nightmare Before Christmas. My son has been watching this since he was 2. Danny Elfman is brilliant once again. As a big Oingo Boingo follower I have come to appreciate his Scores as well. The characters are all loveable and it helped my son to not be afraid of &quot;monsters&quot;. I definitely recommend this movie. Watch it from October 1st all the way to Christmas.
B00004VXF2|1.0|The 70+ reviews here of this CD are proof no one should ever buy anything after reading Amazon reviews.  The genetic debris who pose as the tragically hip love this noise because it's from Lou Reed.  In the same way they love Fun House from the Stooges because it's from Iggy.  But If Yoko Ono's name was on this CD instead, it would get the review it deserves.  Two Virgins, the Wedding Album and Metal Machine Music make good coasters, and it's cool when your record company thinks you're so brilliant that you can be completely indulgent.  I don't blame Lou (I get it), but I blame his gullible fan base that are into water sports so much that they can get pissed on, but still not get pissed off.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is an awesome group ... another album that is perfect from start to finish ... not a  bad song or thing to say about one.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Having listened to Spock's Beard, Transatlantic &amp; Neal on his own I was very curious about his latest release.  It blew me away.  If only the Christian music market could listen to this;  this is what it's all about.  Great lyrics and just great music.  But I'm sure the Christian market will just keep generating the same old stuff.  Too bad, but great for artists like Neal.  What isn't great about this cd, nothing.  It rocks and gives you insight into Neal's journey in becoming a Christian.  It has all the elements of prog but has enough there for the casual listener that just might stumble onto this.  I'm sure many fans of Neal won't care for the direction he has taken, but this doesn't mean he won't come back with more of a secular cd next time.  But you kind of had to expect this especially after listening to the two Transatlantic cd's and the 'Snow' cd from Spock's Beard, his last.  Spiritiuality was running amuck in those so this was just a short step away.  Being a Christian myself I don't listen to too much Christian music because it doesn't have what secular music does and just not lyrically either.  (I agree with dpmomberg's comments about this) Although I'm sure they're trying just look at this cd and you can see that they are not even up to this level yet.  Great CD.  Check It Out!  You'll be glad that you did.
B000083E79|5.0|Let's keep in mind that before we begin here that there are SEVERAL Cher greatest/best of's out there. Trying to pick out the right one may be difficult ... this hopefully will be the winner!<br />This is the only one that has the biggest hits that she had each decade. From the 60's to the 00's there's something here from all periods. Her big 60's hits ... the early 70's smashes ... her late 80's comeback ... the 90's techno ... it's all here!<br />Everyone will find that there are some songs missing ... for that there are two other good collections out there to fill in the gaps. Get the Geffen comp If I Could Turn Back Time &amp; the MCA collection of her earlier works (prior 1979) if this helps any.<br />This really is the best of all of them out there.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Nice to see one of Elt`s greatest and forgotten songs featured...Yeah, I`m talking about Little Jeanie.  I`d love to hear a new live version of this....It could be great with the brass and female backing vocals....maybe the whole thing speeded up a bit...Great chorus although Elt didn`t like the `acrobat` line...I thought it was different!

0345360338|4.0|I think Penman is absolutely a masterful authoress.  Here Be Dragons is one of my favorite books of all time, with some of the best characters I've come across in any of my readings...John Plantagenet, Llewelyn Fawr, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard Fitzroy and of course sweet and poignant Joanna...they are all wonderful and I grab at any chance to read more about them in Penman's incarnations.<br />I clasped Falls the Shadow to my chest with joy after I finished the first book and read greedily.  I have to admit that the death of a certain someone in the first hundred or so pages reduced me to tears in the middle of a crowded airport...how embarrassing!  But the book itself is fabulous.  My only complaint is that since the series goes generationally, some of my favorite characters fade away to be replaced by ones that aren't, at first, as cool, but generally they grow on me...<br />It traces the characters that we left off with in Here Be Dragons, Llewelyn and Joanna and their two fractious sons, Davydd, their legitimate son and Llewelyn's heir, the one with the best brain, and Gruffydd, Llewelyn's first born and best loved and the increasing rivalry between the latter two.  Davydd ap Llewelyn is another one of Penman's characters that one simply can't forget.  He's so mysterious, yet so real at the same time and every time the narrative shifts to him, I read hungrily, hoarding every insight into him.  Anytime I come across a mention of him in a history book or something, I become obscenely interested.  I think she has a peculiar gift in that way, to make a character like poor, illegitimate Joanna and her son, minor characters in the annals of history, into real and convincing humans full of mystery and valor.  It makes for a great read.<br />Another thread that Penman picks up in this second book is the legitimate Plantagenet line, with Nell, King John's youngest, and her encounter with the smouldering young Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester.  The romance between them is absolutely searing.  But the ineffective English king, Nell's brother Henry, becomes a source of tension between them, just as John was for Joanna and Llewelyn in the first book, and the two men end up at odds.  Simon's high principles lead him to champion the poor and downtrodden and his boisterous sons join their father's noble campaign.  Unfortunately, for them, at least, Henry also has a loyal son, the future king Edward (Creepy dude in The Reckoning, let me tell you).  Edward has all the genius and ambition that his father lacks, much to Simon's woe.<br />The novel culminates with the spectacular Battle of Evesham (It's interesting that Penman, deft as she is with the love scenes, also has a real flair for the battlefield!).  Even knowing what the outcome had to be, I still found myself hoping and I consider that the mark of a truly masterfully written narrative.  I really like this book, but the only thing that puts me off a little bit is that her female characters seem to be 13th century Feminists and the occasional pop-psych term that crops up every now and then.  All that aside, any fans of medieval history will delight in her always-accurate details about the character's daily lives as well as her high pitched battles, vivid medieval locales, her tense court gatherings and glowing character interactions.  This is a must-read and I would have given it five stars had I not loved Here Be Dragons even more.them is absolutely searing.

B00006SFBD|5.0|Admittedly, this album had to grow on me a bit longer than &quot;Still Life&quot; of &quot;Blackwater Park.&quot;  But 10 spins or so later I find myself playing this CD more often than any of their albums.  Opeth is a phenomenal band, and this is another great album with superb production and memorable songwriting and musicianship.  The songs &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Master's Apprentices&quot; kick ass!!!  While &quot;A Fair Judgement&quot; and &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; provide the more subtle, lighter side of Opeth.  The progressive masterpiece on this CD is, hands down, &quot;By the Pain I See in Others.&quot;  With everything from carnival music keyboard flourishes to a jamming acoustic guitar interlude, the only thing missing on this song is the kitchen sink.  Outstanding!!!

B0000AI44Q|5.0|First, this is a fantastic album. I am not an obsessive Neil Young fan but I do feel the music on this album is terrific. The way all the tunes move together reminds me of the Who's original &quot;Tommy&quot;. The concept album &quot;Tommy&quot; had magic that other artists such as Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson and even Radiohead have tried to capture. Simple and magical.Neil Young has captured that Tommy musical magic on Greendale. &quot;Be the Rain&quot; is a wonderfully balanced ending to this CD with just enough exclamation.<br />That being said I couldn't help but notice that the introduction and rythmn guitar of &quot;grandpa's interview&quot; is exactly like the Rolling Stone's &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; from the Tattoo You album. Listen to them side by side. They are both great songs. Hope the Stone's don't litigate. They have been on the other end of this with K.D. Lang's &quot;Constant Craving&quot;.
B00006IK1C|4.0|This isnt really a review although I do like the CD. Im just a little curious, Everyone seems to slam Janick Gers, Did he do something bad, I just saw Iron Maiden along with DIO and Motorhead and as you Maiden heads know Janick is in the lineup, all the guitar work I heard that night was beyond anything my mere words could describe, What an outstanding concert.If someone could shed a little light on the constant Janick slaming for me I would really appreciate it!
0790729725|5.0|I would like to start off by saying that a lot of reviews here are simply complaining about the DVD itself. Please, let's stick to the damn subject, okay? (Maybe they'll release a 15th anniversary edition in 2005.) The DVD is fine.<br />Now, onto the flick. Brilliance. Sheer brilliance. This movie takes you in the life of the NYC Mafia from 1955 to 1980, and follows the life of a young Brooklyn native named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, who's one hell of an actor) who gets into the mob at a young age (13ish). Along the way, he basically learns how to be a \\"wiseguy\\": rackateering, extortion, murder, robberies...no stone goes unturned here. His closest friends are Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci, who's unintentionally funny as a little guy who keeps dropping f-bombs left and right), and Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). Throughout the movie, the viewer gets to witness the comings and goings and comings of the mafia. (If you're squeamish at all, bye. This is NOT the movie for you. Go watch Mary Kate and Ashley instead.) As Henry Hill progresses, his life starts to spiral more and more out of control, and it leads up to the big finish.<br />Anywho, I recommend this one. It may be rather lengthy, but it's interesting the whole way through. Well done.
0694524441|5.0|This is the first Paulo Coelho book that i have read, though i have heard very good reviews regarding 'veronica decides to die'.  Well what can I say it is excellent.  It doesn't take to long to understand the message the book is trying to get across.<br />The message is this;<br />If you have a dream or destiny that you want to achieve then pursue it and listen to your heart.  No matter what obstacles get in your way don't let them stop you and get you down, overcome them and keep going. The path you take is part of that experience and only strengthens you in pursuit of your dreams and destiny. <br />If you put your mind to it anything is possible as longs as your dreams are good at heart, whether it being the job you've always wanted or the girl of your dreams.<br />I've read this over a couple of months ago and it's changed the belief in myself and what i can do.

It's a story of power and betrayal and using people who believe in their mission to betray that mission.  Digital Fortress is a fascinating way to learn more than this reader knew about cryptography,and the suspense makes it a page turner to the end.

My favorite songs on here are: Puff, Danger , and Love of My life a very nice album to own!!!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Finally, The Lion King, one of the best animated films of all time has arrived on DVD.  This is the story of Simba, the future king of his pride.  But after some unfortunate accidents, runs away from his home at pride rock and is found by a couple of outcasts in the jungle.  While back home his Uncle Scar is running the show, and not too well.  Will Simba take back what is rightfully his?<br />This is a story about facing your past, and moving on.  It is wonderfully animated, and quite simply the best of all Disney's animated films.  It's filled with adventure, drama, great music, and comedy.  Timone and Pumba are two of the funniest characters of any cartoon ever. The songs are all some of the best in a Disney film.  This isn't just great for kids, or fans of Disney movies, this film is great as just a movie, of any genre.<br />As for the extra's on the disk, they are plenty.  Lots and lots of behind the scenes stuff that is very interesting.  It lacks the usual Trailer, but does have the Commentary and Deleted Scenes.  It also has two versions of the film, but the new song doesn't fit too well into the film.  It worked in the play but I don't really think it has a place here, and was worthless.  Therefore I prefere the original.  This is hands down a must have for anyone who wants a great DVD collection, and also for anyone who just wants to see one of the best movies ever anytime they want.
B00008438V|5.0|This is a hilarious movie it is about Anthony Michael Hall one of my favorite 1980's actors he and his friends wear bras on their heads and get on the pc and create a woman and this woman is Kelly LeBrock she is created and she has special powers and she does whatever and whenever she wants to people  she is so funny Gary and Wyatt are her masters she gives them whatever they want and she teaches them courage and she really fixes Wyatt's brother Chet very good she turns him into an ugly lizard and then he learns how to treat Wyatt more better and the movie is just so hilarious I would truly recommend anyone to buy this movie I really did enjoy it .  If you grew up in the 1980's and if you are an Anthony Michael Hall fan I would truly recommend that you buy this dvd!!!!!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Of Badu's four releases thus far, this is the second best, only behind her &quot;Live&quot; album. But spectacular is a word that comes to mind when witnessing &quot;Worldwide Underground.&quot; The first three tracks are better than most on what is on radio nowadays. &quot;Woo&quot; is a playful track but funky nonetheless &quot;The Grind&quot; is where things slow down a bit and break the flow of the album. Even &quot;Danger&quot; the album's first single takes a back seat to the rest of the album and can't keep up with the funktivity of the next two tracks &quot;Think Twice&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life Wordwide.&quot; Neo-Soul is alive and well as long as its artists keep putting out efforts like Worldwide Underground.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|this is DEFINITELY the best album of the year.  i've been addicted to it since i bought it.  badu has done it again!  this album is the perfect blend of laid-back soul with a pinch of crunk.  if you're a badu fan, you'll want this.  and if you're not, this album is likely to turn you into one.<br />cop this cd and worship at the alter of badu!
1400049628|4.0|Finally, a decent tome to guide the common man through any zombie armageddon. It is near-perfect, and it offers overall sound advice. Brooks is entirely wrong, however, when it comes to the M-16 (modern variants, incl. the M4) v. AK-47 question. The reliability issues that Brooks cites haven't applied to the M16 in over 25 years. If kept clean and happy, the M16A4 and the M4, are many times more accurate and reliable than the AK-47. In fact, some would say that it is more suited to combatting the living dead than the living, as long-range accuracy is key. Moreover, the M16A4/M4 are common to American military and law enforcement, and no domestic zombie survivalist should pass one up. The author also ignores the proven zombie-killing action of the modern tomahawk: smaller than an ax, bigger than a hatchet, and easier to use than either. One last point, although Brooks is correct in saying that large vehicles are potential death traps, nobody should overlook the break-out power of a good solid trash truck. It won't get you far, but it will get out of the neighborhood in a hurry.
0553573411|4.0|Fizt is back!<BR>Anyone who has enjoyed the first book in this trilogy will love this book! We've watched Fizt grow up,as if we've grown up with him. Now we get to see him as a young adult, still bound by his loyalty to the king, and therefore possessing very little control over his own life. The effect this has on him is amazing to see.<BR>I must warn you, though, that the plot in this book is somewhat slow. But while some would find that frustrating, I found it refreshing. This isn't the kind of book you rush. The author is has written it  in a way that makes you feel as if your living a second life (excuse the melodrama). You laugh when Fizt laughs, you cry when he cries, and when things get really terrible your angry enough to throw book acrooss the room (I had to buy a second copy having thrown the first one into my bathtub) All and all, it's well worh the journey. I highly recommend it!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Although anyone who's close to this band will likely tell you they do not sound anything like The Hives, The Vines or The White Stripes, the resemblances are obvious.  But that's certainly not a bad thing.  'Get Born' is a solid all-around rock album.  There are countless hard rock gems, and then there are a few choice softies.  The song &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; seems to be getting some airplay now, although I'd say there are better tracks to be had.  &quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; is particularly smashing; and my personal favorites &quot;Last Chance&quot;, &quot;Cold Hard Bxtch&quot;, and &quot;Get Me Outta Here&quot; rock harder than anything The White Stripes have ever done.<br />The slower rock songs are &quot;Look What You've Done&quot;, with a beautiful piano tone and piercing lyrics that are as catchy as they are modest; &quot;Move On&quot;, with its sluggish start and country-like demeanor; &quot;Radio Song&quot;, one of the few disappointments; &quot;Come Around Again&quot;, a straightforward but fitting let-go after the killer refrains and guitar riffs of &quot;Cold Hard Bxtch&quot;; and finally, the epic closer, &quot;Timothy&quot;.  The current single, &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, is a smart, lyrically catchy tune to help secure fans, though &quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; is (more) brilliant and musically stunning.  A hidden gem here is clearly &quot;Lazy Gun&quot;.  The funk-felt beat and chants of 'lazy gun messed up my television fun' are just awesome.  Along with &quot;Radio Song&quot;, the only other real weak point is &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;, which fumbles through some handclaps and riffs as if it's imitating something from Veni Vidi Vicious.  But then &quot;Last Chance&quot; and &quot;Get Me Outta Here&quot; just kick your butt harder than a wife-beater 20 drinks over the legal limit ever could.  ...You've been forewarned.  &quot;Get What You Need&quot; does the same, but the beater would be only 10 drinks over.<br />The deal with Jet's 'Get Born' is that it's nothing earth-shatteringly new.  And that's okay.  There a number of great tracks here; and even when you throw in two lacking weaklings, it's still very worthy of 4 stars.  Take a quick listen to the 30-second samples above, especially those of &quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; and &quot;Last Chance&quot;.  It's songs like those, along with the beautiful &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; (also above) that have kept this album in my CD-players since I got it, just 12 hours ago.  And it'll probably be there for a while.  Kick it!with Jet's 'Get Born' is that it's nothing earth-shatteringly new.  And that's okay.

B0000C8AQM|5.0|The School of Rock is an awesome movie and has an awesome soundtrack.  There are great old rock songs and the school sings some great ones too.  I was disappointed, though, since the first song Dewey teaches the kids wasn't on here.  It's still a great cd so buy the soundtrack and see the movie.  They're both great!!
079213690X|5.0|The epic movie Braveheart tells the story of 13th century Scottish hero William Wallace.  Mel Gibson not only starred as William, but also directed this film.  Braveheart was released in the spring of 1995, the film's running time is 2 hours and 50 minutes.  Braveheart won 5 Academy Awards including:  Best Picture, Best Director, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Make-up, and Best Cinematography.  Braveheart was also nominated for Oscar's in the following categories:  Best Original Screenplay, Best Music Score, Best Sound, Best Editing, and Best Costume Design.<br />Summary:  William Wallace a 13th Century Scottish man that leads his people into battle against Edward the Longshanks and his English troops.  The battle is over the oppression and brutality that the Scottish people are being put through.  William leads his people into many great battles,  some of the battles are very bloody but done in the right way to make this film more effective.  William is shown charging his people up with patriotism as the prepare for battle.  His men are all loyal and ready to die for Scotland.  This film is well made, and tells a great story.  If you have not seen this movie, you have missed Mel Gibson at his very best.  This movie is a must see for anyone who loves history or just a good action war movie.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|Another great film from Pixar and Disney.  The beginning was a little disheartening (reminiscent of Lion King), but you get over that part quickly.  Ellen Degeneres is hilarious, probably the best part of the film.  She was the perfect choice for the part and I found myself laughing out loud many times (especially love the whale talk).  The animation was amazing, the character were great, and the storyline was cute.  This is a must see for everyone!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|If you are a Badu fan, then you know what to expect.  There are no hidden punches in this short (under 60 minutes and only 8 songs + two interludes) cd.  What it lacks in quantity, it may make up in quality.  I dare say this is more political than the previous Badu releases.  And this is a good thing.  Worldwide Underground is able to combine conscious melodies and rhythmic messages (best exemplified by track 6, &quot;Grind&quot; featuring the hip hop dynamic duo - Dead Prez).  Tracks 2 and 4 are quintessential Eryka Badu.  The only concern is the length.  It is almost as if this is half of a cd (and/or it leaves you wanting more . . . like 5 songs more).  Still, a very solid effort.  Given the lack of good music currently available, this is a strong addition to your cd catalog.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|what can be said about this awesome debut full length cd by aussie rockers jet...where to start...lets just say mix a bit of classic &quot;ac/dc&quot; with a touch of &quot;rolling stones&quot;, add a bit of &quot;the sweet&quot; and &quot;t-rex&quot;, with a pinch of &quot;the beatles&quot; and you have &quot;JET&quot;. i highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys the company of classic guitar riffs with the catchy hip grabbing, toe tapping, hypnotic beat.

B00000F3YL|5.0|This movie is filled with great British humor.  The fab 4 did a great job in this movie (even Ringo)
0066214122|1.0|...Tasty, but not particularly filling.  As one reviewer noted, this has the unmistakeable feel of a movie treatment.  I had thought that the novels that movies were based upon were supposed to be richer in detail, full of character development and those characters' interior worlds.  Crichton glosses from one scene to the next, introducing just enough detail to keep the plot afloat for the next action sequence.<br />No, I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, and yes, Crichton does bring up some interesting ideas about the dangers of nanotechnology and biotechnology.  (Not worthy of a three-page bibliography, usually reserved for scholarly works, but interesting nevertheless.)  Still, this book seemed rather less imaginative than anything by Philip K. Dick, and I found myself not particularly caring about whether the wife would live, or whether the kids were OK, or the end of the world, or anything like that.  The characters were two-dimensional, hurried, barely even sketched.<br />Great idea, haphazard execution.  Perhaps Mr. Crichton's editors are too much in awe of the author-as-moneymaker to offer him constructive advice on the basics of creative writing, but I'm sure there are good community college programs toward that end if he's interested.
B000002I97|5.0|To the idiot who lumped John Denver into the same category as Prine and Dylan: man, what are you thinking? Are you listening to the music? Just cuz Denver covered a Prine song doesn't even put him on the same plateau. Listen to Rocky Mountain High, then take a listen to &quot;Six O'Clock News&quot; and tell me Denver is the same caliber....

B00008UZPD|5.0|This is an excellent sci fi film.  In many ways I enjoyed it more than the first Matrix film because it's less about special effects and more about an engrossing storyline.  The premise of the film isn't original like many critics have been quick to point out, but it's presented in an original style that is very entertaining.  I like to describe it to friends as a sci fi Matrix like film that incorporates martial arts with guns.  There are some gratuitous action scenes but for the most part the action is really cool to watch.  Especially since they use really neat looking guns and every one is dressed up in chic and futurist clothes :)  <br />The acting, the music, the sound effects, and the script all work well together.  I really like the fact that the movie centers around Christian Bale's character rather than the whole anti-authoritarian premise.  As a viewer you actually care about the character John Preston.  It's the quiet scenes within the film that really lend strength of purpose to the action scenes.  Unlike Neo in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; you learn about Preston's past, his wife, the fact that he has kids.  It's great how you don't only remember the action scenes but the quiet scenes as well, like the extermination of the dogs, the arrest of Preston's partner (Sean Bean), and the execution of the rebels.  There is one scene in the film where the main character shares a quiet moment with a puppy and yet seconds later he is blowing away a squad of soldiers.  Surprisingly, scenes such as this worked really well together and weren't inappropriate at all.  That's one of the best things about this film.  It's the fact that SO many things could of went wrong, but it turned out to be very well done.  Highly recommended.
B000084T18|3.0|Why you all giving this 5 stars... that rating should be reserved for album that will, in the future be classic and desired by people from later generations... this is an average rap album... nothing more nothing less... maybe if he wants to learn how to swear in cool ways though, he should listen to The Darkness, i praise Justin Hawkins for stretching expletives over about 3 seconds at a time... this album gets 3 stars... that's all it deserves really... i doubt it'll stick for long
B00009V7T2|5.0|Before going into any pat on the backs....<br />I had never heard anything by these guys before.  Just saw a mag article and since they are latin, it piqued my interest.  Then someone told me they were gonna play live here in P.R. so immediately bought the CD just to know before seeing.  At first, I thought it was weird, in a good kind of way.  It wasn't what I usually listen to...<br />Then I saw them live...<br />Holy mackarel!  I have seen one of the best (if not THE best) band play, right in front of my eyes.  Almost at a loss for words.  My words will not do them justice, so I will not even try.  My brain took a whipping... and I liked it!<br />This, IS music.  Forget the crap you see on TV(M), this is the real deal.  Wether history gives them their props for such an amazing album, is besides the point.  I Know this is an awesome album, others here do know it too.  My faith has been re-awakened.  World is not as crappy as I thought it was.  Art, is alive.  This is not for everyone, nor was it meant to be.  But those who get it, will be better because of it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The Thirteenth step is AWSOME!, i got it the second it hit the shelf and listened to it on my way to the doctors, when i got in the office all my nerves were at ease. it was great.<BR> With Stong instruments from the start of the first track to the end of the last and lyrics that could touch a dead mans heart Thirteenth Step is a masterpiece more deserving of a frame than a cd player.

6305014140|4.0|When &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; first came out, I thought it was the greatest anime since &quot;Akira.&quot; Of course at this time I was really obsessed with anime and was hungry for anything. Last night I was bored and thought I'd watch a movie and decided to watch &quot;Ninja Scroll.&quot; Viewing it this time I didn't think it was as great as I made it and many other anime fans made it out to be. By this, I don't mean it's bad. It's a great anime. It's got everything a good anime has but it doesn't go as deep as other anime films have gone and it is predictable and focused more on action than plot(although the plot is not that bad.) Basically, I highly recommend you rent it but viewing it for the second and third time, it isn't as great as the first viewing.

1565123875|5.0|Those who know Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie from her short stories have high expectations of her.  &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; lives up to expectations.<br />&quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a coming-of-age story set in Nigeria during the Abacha military regime of the mid-1990s, told through the eyes of 15-year-old Kambili Achike.  Kambili's father Eugene, a wealthy Igbo businessman and newspaper publisher, is in many ways a heroic figure; he is a pillar of the church, loyal and generous to his employees and home village and one of the few publishers with the courage to stand up to the military government.  The same fanatic religious faith that feeds his stern public morality, however, leads him to ostracize his father and physically abuse his wife and children.<br />Kambili, who has lived under her father's hand throughout her life, is a shadow of a person as the novel begins.  As the story progresses, she learns independence and self-reliance from her university-professor aunt Ifeoma, her teenage cousin Amaka and the iconoclastic priest Father Amadi.  At the same time, the deterioration of the country and her father's increasingly abusive behavior drive the family closer to collapse.<br />&quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a powerful and sophisticated first novel, and comparison between Adichie and Igbo literary giant Chinua Achebe is not out of place.  Achebe's novels, though, tend toward the epic, using their characters to tell the story of their country.  Adichie has also spoken in this voice, in short stories such as &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun,&quot; but &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; is a more intimate portrait.  Politics sometimes intrudes through scenes of student riots and the persecution of one of Eugene's editors, but most of the political events happen offstage and are seen through their effect on the family.  For all the powerful sense of place in &quot;Purple Hibiscus,&quot; Kambili's story is one that could happen anywhere.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I actually managed to watch this movie without having ever seen the trailer, which accounts for my reaction.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; begins with a pair of bickering siblings, Patricia (Gina Philips) and Darius Jenner (Justin Long) driving home from college along a fairly deserted back road.  Shortly after discussing the local rural legend, a nice little cautionary tale about drinking and driving, a speeding truck (a late 1940's Model Rio, a flatbed truck with the back built up to look a bit like a meat wagon from Hell) sneaks up on them and just about runs them off the road.  Shaken by their escape, the kids become even more rattled when they drive by a rundown church and see the truck, with its odd looking driver now doing something rather unsettling.  To make matters worse, he sees them, and once again the truck sets off in pursuit.<br />In terms of contemporary horror films, the opening for &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is extremely effective.  After all, it takes place in the bright light of day and still manages to creep you out.  But then, as Patty notes, we get to the part where the kids in the movie do something stupid that ultimately dooms them to the horrors of the rest of the film.  Actually, when Darry discovers the grim truth of what has been going on underneath that old church, this 2001 horror film reaches its high point.  At that point &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes off in a rather unexpected and ultimately unrewarding direction.  If you have seen the trailer, then you already know what the payoff is (although why a movie would want to give that much away in the trailer is, as always, beyond me), but I was not only surprised, but rather disappointed.<br />This is a shame because the performances by the two leads in this film are way above the traditional low bar set in a splatter flick.  Phillips and Long do not especially look like siblings, but they fight like them.  More importantly, they manage to maintain a sense of realism as the proceedings get more absurd.  They are clearly the best thing in this film (Long was nominated for a Saturn Award), along with the truck.  But once Darry learns the truth, writer-director Victor Salva throws away the film's powerful momentum to enter the familiar slasher silliness of Freddy and Jason territory.  Given the level of tension that is created, I was actually a bit miffed that suddenly the film was invoking humor.  The final shot of the film is rather predictable given the premise, but its greater sin is in running counter to the tone of the film's opening.<br />Admittedly, I might have rated this film higher if I had known what it was really all about because then the payoff would not have been such a disappointment.  To be fair, given how strong the opening of &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is it might have been impossible to come up with an ending as good, but I sure would have liked to have seen Salva come up with a better effort.  Now there is a sequel to this 2001 film, which just reconfirms another of my working hypotheses, that a really great horror film precludes the possibility of a sequel, whatever the appeal of the box office.eedings get more absurd.

0446530891|3.0|This easy-read mystery is a return to the successful format of Baldacci's earliest successes, after a detour into more emotional territory. This author's real strength lies in the mystery/suspense genre, his ability to structure a concise plot with the incisive logic necessary for a notable effort.<br />In 1996, while on protective detail, Sean King fails to stop an attempt on the life of Clyde Ritter, a presidential candidate, during a planned campaign stop. Clyde Ritter is killed, although King shoots the assassin and is wounded himself in the crossfire. However, King's career in the Secret Service is in tatters after this fiasco. For one split second, the agent's attention was captured by something other than his assigned civilian. That critical second led to questions and Sean's denouement as an effective agent. It also planted a seed of self-doubt in his mind concerning his performance.<br />Eight years later, another presidential candidate, John Bruno, is kidnapped while under government protection, this one on the watch of Michelle Maxwell. Agent Maxwell is determined to find John Bruno before he's killed and is interested in the similarities between her scenario and that of Agent King. This quirk in Baldacci's latest mystery is a subplot that surfaces when the two Secret Service agents combine their talents to solve Ritter's death and Bruno's disappearance. There is a particular mastermind behind both the assassination and the disappearance and Agent Sean King finds a willing co-conspirator in Agent Michelle Maxwell.<br />Once they join forces and compare notes, Sean and Michelle are even more convinced that their cases are connected. Their combined resources offer a better chance for solution, although King can no longer use his Secret Service affiliations to access information. However, King does have a contact, ex-agent Joan Dillinger, now successfully working in the private sector. King and Dillinger have a romantic past, one that ended with Clyde Ritter's assassination, but Dillinger is willing to help with Sean and Michelle's investigation, for a price. Maxwell and King are willing to pay that price.<br />Bit by bit, the plot is uncovered, until the agents find themselves confronted by an unexpected and dangerous adversary. Baldacci keeps the reader off balance with unusual twists and turns. The author is reviving his mystery/suspense career, a welcome change.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I never really followed AKUS, although I'm a fan of bluegrass, and just bought this album because it looked like a good introduction.    After listening to it once, I was blown away.  Once I was able to tear myself away from hearing &quot;Baby, Now That I've Found You&quot; I went out and bought all the original AKUS albums I could find.  <br />Every single track on this album is better than the original version.  The band is on fire.  Krauss' vocals are breathtaking.  You can hear the crowd is having a great time, but they get out of the way and let you hear the songs.  It's the best of both worlds -- an outstanding &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album for the band as well as the feeling of being at one of their concerts.  And it avoids the cold, somber, somewhat over-produced and awkward feeling of the band's studio albums.<br />I can't imagine anyone hearing the versions of &quot;Choctaw Hayride,&quot; or &quot;Oh Atlanta,&quot; or &quot;Maybe,&quot; or &quot;Take Me For Longing,&quot; or &quot;We Hide And Seek,&quot; on this album and not becoming an instant fan of this band.  Plus, the beautiful &quot;Baby, Now That I've Found You,&quot; and of course &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; from the O Brother soundtrack are included too.<br />And if you become as big a fan of this record as I have, check out the Live DVD, which gives you the whole concert as well as interviews with Krauss &amp; the rest of the band.  It's really light-hearted and gives you the feeling that no matter how hopeless and depressing the themes of the songs are, the band's just out there to have fun.
B00004ZDVQ|1.0|If you love Stevie Wonder's music, you owe it to yourself to hunt-down a non-remastered version of these collections.  I had the earlier versions, and lost one of the discs, so came back to Amazon to buy it again, and ordered this, thinking &quot;hmm, remastered, and both discs in the same package&quot; ...  <br />Big disappointment.  It sounds compressed and equalized excessively, it's harshly brighter, more distorted sounding and overall unpleasant to listen to.  Also, the level of the analog tape hiss is notably hotter than on my &quot;old&quot; version!  Certainly compressing and EQ'ing old masters can effectively raise the level of hiss, but this seems like more than what I would expect from that and I can't figure why.  I almost wonder if this remastering was mistakenly done from an analog copy of the original master tapes (which is not unheard of).   Regardless, it just plain sounds wrong. <br />Save yourself a minor heartache..  If the non-remastered versions are no longer available, buy used.

B000002HPT|4.0|Of all the albums in Dream Theater's catalog, Falling into Infinity is probably the most criticized. A lot of the band's hardcore fans feel that it is overly commercial. This album is certainly a bit more commercial then their other releases, but it still is the hard progressive rock that we've come to expect from Dream Theater. There are a bunch of ballads on the album, but I don't see that as much of a problem. Hollow Years and Take Away The Pain are both very nice songs, even if they are rather commercial by Dream Theater's standards. No serious fan of the band should pass this album up. It's a great album with some of their best songs. This is the only full-length studio album that the band did with keyboardist Derek Sherinian. He was never really given the spotlight as Kevin Moore or Jordan Rudess were, so you can expect a more guitar-heavy sound to this one. Lines In The Sand is the best song on here. It's a really different song for DT, but it works very well. Doug Pinnick from King's X contributes some great backing vocals to top it off. Other good songs are New Millennium and Peruvian Skies, but all the songs are listenable. The instrumental, Hell's Kitchen, is also excellent, as it really shows guitarist John Petrucci's versatile talents. Overall, I really like this album. It's not the band's best, but it has some tremendous songs that shouldn't be missed. Fans should definitely check it out. It may take a few listens to get used to the different kind of sound that they have on this album, but it will be worth it when you learn to appreciate it. There's nothing wrong with a band exploring in new directions, especially with a band as talented as Dream Theater. All of their studio work shows why these guys are some of the most talented musicians on the planet, and this album is no exception.
B00003CXB4|5.0|i just bought the dvd yesterday and i already watched it and was reminded of what a great movie it really is.  the difference between the dvd and vhs is amazing, the colors on the dvd stand out so much that the movie takes on a whole different kind of beauty.  although i do have to say that the new song should have stayed out of the movie because honestly it really is not that good.  but my god the original songs of this movie are truly classic.  elton john is such a wonderful songwriter and the songs of this movie are so right that it just makes the movie even better.  the extras on the discs are good and i am sure kids will enjoy them.  all i know is, i wish disney would go back to making movies like this one because the ones they put out lately have been lacking.  the lion king is going to stand the test of time, my reason being, i still get chills from this movie, that is how good it is.  i watch and i know that i am watching something truly special.
B00006CXXU|3.0|&quot;Beautiful&quot; is an instant classic pop tune.  This would've been a hit in any decade.  I don't care that some have accused the lyrics of being trite, this is a great song.  The arrangement is sparse, which works well.  Christina delivers a powerhouse vocal performance.  I've heard the track a million times, and it hasn't worn out it's welcome.<br />Nothing else on the cd is quite that good.  There are a number of excellent cuts, but there is simply too many weak tracks which mar the album as a whole.  Christina's voice is incredible, and it puts her so far ahead of the competition in the teen-pop market it isn't funny.  Actually, much of this cd transcend is good enough to transcend the artistically questionable 'teen' genre.  Hopefully Christina's skill continues to develop.<br />&quot;Cruz&quot; is another highlight, it wouldn't sound out of place on a Sheryl Crow album.  &quot;Soar&quot; and (especially) &quot;Singing my Song&quot; are strong ballads.  &quot;Loving Me for Me&quot; boasts a strong melody and benefits from a subdued vocal delivery.  <br />A number of tracks lack a strong hook, such as the Alicia Keys-penned &quot;Impossible&quot;.  I like the feel of the track, and as usual the vocal is impeccable, but there's something missing.  Other tracks in this category: &quot;Underappreciated&quot;, &quot;Get Mine Get Yours&quot;, and &quot;Infactuation.&quot;  They just don't have strong enough melodies and are forgettable.<br />But overall, this is definitely a cd that adults need not be embarrassed to own.  Looking forward to her next release.

B000089RVX|4.0|Geeze man, you're pretty harsh.  First of all, I've got a list at least as long as my arm of C.D.s worse than this (Bucks Fizz anyone?)... so worst ever?  BZZZTTT.<br />So Amy MOANS huh?  lemme see?  Lacuna Coil... yep.. and Amy... sorry buddy... compared to LC her voice SOARS.  BZZZTTT!<br />The way the chorus sweeps you up in the mood and melody of the song is just great.  I'm driving down the freeway, and it just takes me away... When the song is done, I've done 10 miles, I've got a grin on my face and I've just stepped through a time warp.<br />Oh and as for the &quot;Linkin Park&quot; association folks... I guess you're listening through your favourite Radio Shack speakers... no wonder you can't tell the difference.  Try some Q-tips.  Works wonders.<br />As for ugly... you know... I've never seen the video.. I've heard it on the radio first.  Then I downloaded it (yep I'm evil) and decided I liked it and went out and bought it (hello RIAA, I'm the anomaly).  Besides who gives a flying #^*&amp;^ what she LOOKS like.  (is she cute? I've only seen the album cover and I wouldn't kick her out of bed).<br />Anyhow, on the matto scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the worst, ten being the best) I'd give this C.D. a SEVEN.<br />Why the mark down?  The tracks are a bit &quot;same-ish&quot;.  Appart from the balads, it feels similar.  Take a 5 second sound bite and it sounds the same.  Speaking of ballads, if I can't get the pants of a chick to &quot;Hello&quot; (gotta love the chello) I'll hang up my spurs and go work behind the bar of a Hilton serving up fluffy ducks to the 40-somthings.<br />Thanks for taking the time to read my cruddy little review.  You're all stars ;-)
B00003CXXP|1.0|Two things:<BR>1) This definitely goes on my personal 10-worst-movies list.<BR>2) The only good part of this truly, truly awful film is a close-up of Jude Law's eyes.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This film has always been one of my favorite horror films of the late 1970s. It's essentially an old-fashioned ghost story influenced by the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft (and implicitly Arthur Machen). I originally saw the film during its original theatrical run and was impressed with the subtle and atmospheric nature of the film. The films was released around the time of the original Friday the 13th film and was a refreshing change from the overt violence of many films from that era. The performances are solid, the script is tight, and the cinematography (for a moderately budgeted film) is superlative. One of my favorite sequences occurs during the opening sequence when the town starts coming apart, there is a sequence with a clerk sweeping up after hours in a supermarket. The shot is marvelously done as we see the clerk respond to the situation. <BR>I really can't add to what the previous reviewers have stated. The extras are good and the transfer is well done. Recommended for devotees of early John Carpenter films (back in the days when he was breaking new ground) as well as fans of literate and atmospheric horror films.
B00003CXB4|5.0|OK lets get this straight... I would have bought this and given it five stars even if it didn't have a new song. But unfortunatly disney decided they needed to add a new crappy song so they could market it and sell more copies.  This is a fabulous movie, but i will only be watching the theatrical version from now on.  Goodness the new song is tacked on and bad.  But since the original is about 7 stars on a five star scale it balances out.

B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson's &quot;Braveheart&quot; is a thundering, full-blooded epic that, I think, will rise above even its hardiest detractors to rank among some of the greatest biopics in movie history (and here I'm thinking &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Patton,&quot; which I'm sure were on Gibson's mind when he made this picture).<br />Is this movie a true-to-life portrait of the real William Wallace? I doubt it, and Mel Gibson pretty well admits that it isn't, but who cares? Ships make no sound in the vastness of space, but that doesn't stop us from enjoying (and buying into) &quot;Star Wars.&quot; If I'm going to give William Wallace and what he stood for (maybe) any serious thought at all, it's going to be precisely in the context of a movie like this.<br />What really shines through, especially after repeated viewings, is Gibson's absolute passion for the art and craft of filmmaking. &quot;Braveheart&quot; crackles with excitement, texture, energy, feeling. It hardly feels like a three-hour film; we are so consumed with William Wallace's bloody quest to rid Scotland of its &quot;Anglish&quot; possessors that we hardly even want the movie to end. By the end of my first viewing, I felt exhausted and more than a little awed by the lengths to which Gibson's character went to liberate his country. Today I'm just in awe of &quot;Braveheart,&quot; period. The Academy obviously showed good sense (for a change) when it handed Gibson the top two awards for 1995.<br />Yeah, the movie is gruesome and violent, but all in the name of presenting its character in the boldest possible light: to portray Wallace as a larger-than-life hero whose local conflicts bestow upon him the mantle of international legend. (After all, didn't a certain country come along centuries later and take up a certain beef against the British in its pursuit of freedom?) Wallace, at least in the terms of this movie, was a true hero, dedicated to avenging the murder of his beloved wife and devoted to theliberty of his fellow countrymen. What a guy.<br />Gibson plays the lead with equal passion. Now here is an actor who knows how to play a mythical character in a film of undeniably huge scope. Unlike Russell Crowe's dour, dreary work in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; Gibson plays Wallace with great humor and teeth-gnashing savagery. You feel every instant of Wallace's pain and share in his joy, thanks to Gibson's remarkable portrayal. Why he wasn't even nominated for Best Actor is beyond me. And by the way, in a fight, Wallace would rip the lungs out of Gen. Maximus inside of about two seconds.<br />Patrick McGoohan excels as the vile Longshanks, and Sophie Marceau provides much-needed feminine beauty as Wallace's French-born lover on the side of the English. There's also Brendan Gleeson as Wallace's childhood sidekick -- not that Wallace really needs one.<br />I could go on. You get the idea. &quot;Braveheart&quot; is a great film. I don't know who among you hasn't seen it by now. If you haven't, then do so immediately. Gibson will probably never be this good again.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|this is a tight cd love the donald byrd remake of think twice but I prefer donald's version better still erykah keeps it very funky and fresh whoever said jazz fusion is dead should listen to this you can hear the herbie hancock-roy ayers influences all over this is a good cd please cop this.<br />p.s please cop this cd once again.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I can see where some people have a problem with this film. Some of the events are inventions of the film makers and it isn't the perfect companion to the novel. But come on, this is an adaptation of a novel with such depth that it certainly appears to be impossible to translate, unchanged, to the big screen. I enjoy the film for what it is, a wonderfully emotional and engrossing tale, with very believable performances and top notch production values. It is in my opinion, the best middle part of a trilogy yet.
B000002G6J|5.0|I guess one could go on forever expressing the delight in experiencing the brazilian style of samba or bossa nova which comes from the works of Jobim, though not alone, there are variables.  The work on this album is no exception.  Get it! and enjoy the fruits of beautiful music.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is amazing. Why am I such a to-die-for 80's fan that knows everything 80's about everyone 80's, but I was the last one to find out about The Postal Service? Was it a little secret being kept from me? <br />This CD is going down in my personal history books.. its up there with the best of today and the best of then! Some of the songs on this album just give way to my heart. They also give me chills that last for hours! I'd rather listen to the simple sounds, the quick beats, and the meaningful vocals of The Postal Service over a lot of my other favorite albums.<br />The Postal Service songs have a drumbeat very similar to that of &quot;The Sparks&quot;, an 80's new wave band famous for their songs in the movie and soundtrack of Valley Girl. The beats in The Postal Service's songs are drumbeats at the speed of dance beats. The vocals give reminders to the voices of the Pet Shop Boys. This isn't rock music. This isn't dance music. The best title I can think of is &quot;techno-wave&quot; or ROCK MUSIC meets TECHNO MUSIC. I guess it is hard to classify or compare The Postal Service to anybody else because they are working with their very own style.<br />With the &quot;electroclash&quot; movement that is re-inventing the synth-pop sound of the 80's, and with the indie rock movement featuring bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes who are giving us pre-new wave sounds, and with the new new wave groupies like Hot Hot Heat, The Faint and Interpol, and now with a &quot;techno-rock&quot; sound in The Postal Service, I OFFICIALLY can say I no longer have to live in the 80's. I am no longer living in oblivion!!! I now live my life in the 00's and it's groups like &quot;The Postal Service&quot; that helped re-invent the wheel and make old stuff new again 20 years later.
B00003CXDG|3.0|For my box office money, Year 2000 was one of the worst ever, with a plethora of bloated, overlong, overrated flicks (&quot;Gladiator,&quot; &quot;Cast Away,&quot; &quot;What Lies Beneath,&quot; &quot;The Patriot,&quot; &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;). Though not by any means a great movie, &quot;M:I-2&quot; rises to the top of my memory almost by default. It's dumb, but at least it's fast and entertaining.<br />John Woo knows how to stage, direct and photograph action sequences, and it's a good thing his star, Tom Cruise, knows how to act in them and even how to perform many of his own stunts. &quot;M:I-2&quot; wisely conserves the wildest action for about the last 45 minutes, beginning with Cruise's daring penetration of a high-rise and ending with probably the longest fistfight sequence in history.<br />I didn't believe a minute of this silly, slick, superficial piece of eye candy. The good thing is, Woo and Cruise don't ask us to. They intend only to seduce us with surface level charm. They succeed, brilliantly. Here is an action movie that takes the effort to find poetry in its visuals, like the extended scene that introduces Cruise's affable spy, Ethan Hunt, to the femme fatale, Nyah, played fetchingly by the alluring Thandie Newton. It's a flirtatious dance with larceny at its core, taken to a new level by the mountaintop car chase, another dance that leads eventually to physical passion. We may not care about Ethan and Nyah, but wow, they look great together.<br />Much of &quot;M:I-2&quot; is over the top and ridiculous, and a lot of the dialogue is banal, taking us from Point A to Point B. But Woo finds all sorts of ways to make the movie interesting without dialogue. Maybe the best news of all is that this never, for a moment, feels like a sequel, thankfully because Cruise intends each entry in the franchise to feel like a brand-new, standalone film (never mind the numeral in the title). Think what Tarantino could do with this material.<br />&quot;Think.&quot;Now there's a word you don't want anywhere near &quot;M:I-2.&quot; At least this movie has the courage to live up to its own mindlessness. And I won't even gripe about the bad Anthony Hopkins performance. Are Cruise and Woo that good? Yep, they are.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Never have I been happier about having bought something than about this DVD.  I've been a big fan of Led Zeppelin for a while now, and I already knew that Page, Plant, and Bonham were the masters of their respective trades, but seeing these live performances took my respect for them to a whole new level.  The performance at Knebworth in 1979 is by far my favorite; in my mind, it shows decisively that Zeppelin were still on their way up when Bonzo's death tragically brought the magic to an end.  The &quot;funky&quot; version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; completely blew me away, lodged itself in my head for days and put a spring (maybe even a swagger) in my step.  Jimmy Page's playing in &quot;Achilles' Last Stand&quot; is simply the most expressive playing of any instrument I've ever seen.  It's clear that the man had absolutely no reason to pay any heed to technique, he just played whatever he wanted.  I bought the DVD and the three-disk set the day they came out last summer.  What are you waiting for?
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I just bought this movie and was so thrilled! I had wanted to go see it in theaters when it first came out but none of my friends had seen it so I had no feedback. I had been wanting to see it and found it on sale. Yes, I bought it without seeing it first cause I knew it had to be good. I think it's excellent and would compare it to Oceans 11, another great and exciting movie.

B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is one of the most popular artists ever, transcending a whole generation and maintaining popularity all over the world. The Immaculate Collection chronicles the early part of her career, 1983-1990.  It includes her earliest hits, &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, and follows her rise to the top, with &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, and through &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Express Yourself&quot; (both remixed). It finishes with the perfect &quot;Vogue&quot; and the new (at the time) cuts &quot;Justify My Love&quot; (dirty!) and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.  This album is essential for putting most of Madonna's early hits in one place. Unfortunately, we're missing &quot;True Blue&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, and &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;, among others. While the album is incomplete (the Q-sound does not sound that bad, by the way), it's still a great overview of Madonna's early years. Eventually we'll have all of the singles together (although now it would be four discs), but until then, buy this!
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Summary:<BR>Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) are career criminals that have surrounded themselves with criminal experts to help them in their burgling exploits. They have their getaway specialist, Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), their technology specialist, Lyle/The Napster (Seth Green), and their demolitions specialist, Left Ear (Mos Def). <BR><BR>The movie begins with a very well thought out heist in Venice, Italy where the gang, with the help of another career criminal, Steve (Edward Norton), steals 30+ million dollars in gold and pulls it off without a hitch... well, almost.<BR><BR>The hitch is Steve double crosses the rest of the group, kills John, and leaves the rest for dead. But Charlie and the rest of the gang don't give up so easily. They escape, regroup, and track Steve down in Los Angeles. The only problem is without John, who also happened to be the group's safe cracker, the group doesn't have anyone that can open the safe where Charlie is keeping the gold. Charlie then turns to John's daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), who happens to be a legitimate safe specialist, to help them bring Steve down by stealing his gold.<BR><BR>Stella agrees and the group sets up their plan - lure Steve out of the house, break in, steal the gold, and get out of LA before Steve is any wiser. But Steve catches on to the plan when he figures out Stella's identity. The result is a much more complicated plan that results in high speed chases involving helicopters, Mini-Coopers, and armored trucks. The movie ends with Steve being done in by someone other than Charlie's group, but he is delivered into their hands by Charlie. Though it takes some doing, Charlie and the gang get the gold, Stella gets satisfaction, and Charlie and Stella get each other. <BR><BR>My Comments:<BR>Following in the tradition of caper movies, this movie sets you up to root for criminals (something my wife continuously points out to me as being supportive of anti-social behaviors). Also, this movie is kind of a remake of a movie from the sixties with the same name. But based upon what the writers and director of the film have to say (I haven't seen the original), the movies are actually quite different. <BR><BR>As far as the story goes, it's pretty solid. I was very impressed by the eventual resolution of pretty much every plot point. For example, after `The Italian Job' (the heist in Venice), each of the gang members goes around saying what they are going to do with their share of the money. When Steve turns on them, they obviously can't afford to do what they had planned. However, Steve takes all of their advice and gets all of the things they had wanted. But once the tables are again reversed and Steve meets his fate, the movie concludes with the dreams of the gang members being realized. This is really just a very small part of the movie, but the fact that it was included and well-resolved speaks highly of the care given to details in this film.<BR><BR>However, there are some problems with the story that, if resolved, would have made the movie both more convincing and more entertaining. The major problem I had with the story was Stella's motivation for getting involved in the second heist. I think through a combination of poor acting on Charlize Theron's part and part scripting and dialogue, Stella's motivation turns into a mottled sense of revenge, but it was not a very convincing sense of revenge and definitely didn't seem like enough motivation to leave what appeared to be a very good job in order to get involved in what could potentially result in Stella's death. If you can give the movie leeway here, the rest of the movie is good enough that you can quickly forget that Stella's motivation is not only shallow but weak. <BR><BR>The other problems really just involve kind of poor decisions on the part of the writers, even though the decisions are probably justified because without them themovie would not have been able to continue. How the gang survives being dumped into a reservoir in the top of the Alps is beyond me. After about a minute in that water they would have been suffering the effects of hypothermia. It never could have happened. Also rather silly is the idea that Steve, who just happens to be on the lamb, would hit on a cable repair person despite thinking that he recognizes her. This obviously advances the story by given Charlie and his gang the ideas for plan B and makes the movie much more exciting, but is still pretty forced. I should point out, however, that despite having problems with some of these things I really didn't see them as being that distracting. It really is a pretty solid movie.<BR><BR>As for the acting, I was actually pretty impressed, especially by Mark Wahlberg. Perhaps this is just the perfect role for him, because I have not been impressed with him in the past, or maybe he's just improving, but I really liked him in this role. With the exception of some of Charlize Theron's poorer segments, the rest of the cast was really good. Seth Green, Jason Statham, and Mos Def were all very funny. I do have to admit that I was surprised to see Statham in a supporting role after what I thought was a pretty good performance in The Transporter. The only other problem I had with the acting is that Edward Norton's abilities as an actor didn't seem to be utilized to their fullest extent. He has done some incredible stuff, but he wasn't really a stand out in this film. I think just about anyone could have played that role and played it about as well as he did. He was fine, but this definitely wasn't Fight Club or American History X.<BR><BR>Overall, this is a very entertaining movie. When you find out by watching the special features that almost all of the stunts and chase scenes are real rather than CGI I think pretty much anyone will be amazed at what the makers of this film were able to do. With a fairly solid story and pretty good acting, I'm going to recommend this to action movie fans. The story isn't super-deep and the characters aren't as developed as those from a Kerouac novel, but this is a very enjoyable movie.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Okay this is NOT some bad retake of overdone Xmas classics. Anderson and company do add life with wonderful new arrangements to a couple of more European Xmas classics along with new interpretations of Xmas-related Tull songs. The new material, such as &quot;Birthday Card at Xmas&quot; is great as well.<br />If you like &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot; and &quot;Heavy Horses,&quot; (that is, you love the Tull folk period) you will really enjoy this record. All Music Guide ([...]) is giving this 4-stars and saying it is Tull's best work since the 1970's. Not that Tull hasn't had good product since then, but I can definitely see their point.<br />Be sure to see the Tull website for samples! I think they will be doing a contest near the end of October as well. [...] Ian is doing his Rubbing Elbows concerts in the USA Sept-Nov and doing a lot the songs from this album.
0385504209|1.0|A contrived story with weak characterization and laughable plot, salted with a number of pseudo historical factoids.  For a much better novel with a similar theme may I recommend Wilton Barnhardt's &quot;Gospel&quot;.

Then in September we saw the Broadway Lion King in Chicago.  I now have a new sense of what it means to people when they say Disney is Magic and Africa is the most beautiful place on Earth. I watch this dvd with a new respect towards Africa and her wildlife, a renewed sense of being in the circle of life.

B000002BQK|4.0|There was no way Mariah was going to top the dream that was Daydream.  That classic had too many sweet and tender ballads, and some nice mid-paced numbers, even one with a skippy beat.  If Butterfly was Butterfly, Daydream was a painted bunting proudly showing its colours like a rainbow.  Wait, that's the name of the album after this!  Never mind.<br />&quot;Honey&quot; is sort of a cousin to &quot;Fantasy&quot; but here is a case where with the drum and keyboard programming, Mariah is starting to fool with the hip-hop that would become annoying with Rainbow's &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;.  I'm referring to the guest vocals by Lox and Mase.  She sings &quot;you know sugar was never this sweet&quot;, but I wouldn't apply it to this Puffy Combs-produced song.<br />Ah, there's nothing like a Mariah and Walter Afanasieff co-written song, and the title track is no exception.  &quot;Butterfly&quot; has Mariah tearfully letting go of someone she loved too much that the guy decided to leg it, but she does have hope and will accept a future return.  &quot;Spread your wings and prepare to fly/for you have become a butterfly/fly abandonedly into the sun/if you should return to me/we tryly were meant to be/so spread your wings and fly/butterfly&quot; sung in a gospel-like manner by Mariah, Melonie Daniels, and Mary Ann Tatum.<br />Beginning with Spanish-sounding guitar, &quot;My All&quot; is a quieter more melodic ballad, and the string synths kick in when she sings the chorus a second and third time, at which time her voice reaches her emotional peak:  &quot;I give you my all to have/just one more night with you/I'd risk my life to feel/Your body next to mine&quot;  Really intimate here!<br />&quot;The Roof&quot; is a mid-paced quasi hip-hop number with no guest rappers, but it could be a good ballad if it kept the string synths and backup singers.  If it were better, it would be worth the 5 minutes+.<br />&quot;Fourth Of July&quot; is more like it, another romantic ballad with dreamy keyboards, and slow programmed drums.  Another intimate interlude spend inside while the firecrackers and Roman candles are doing their magic.  &quot;Tangled up with you among the fireflies/on the Fourth of July&quot; goes the refrain.  Wow!<br />&quot;Breakdown&quot; features members from the gangster rap group Mo Thugs, Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone, who contribute some unwanted raps mid-song and backing vocals.  Otherwise, it'd be another nice ballad.  Producer is... figures... Mr. Combs.<br />&quot;Babydoll&quot; is of a woman anxiously waiting for her lover late at night in the hotel room.  She gets more sexy in some of her lyrics, singing &quot;Zoning out thinking about/you and me between the sheets&quot;.  A loungy R&amp;B ballad with some programmed drums backing.<br />&quot;Close My Eyes&quot; is a piano ballad about self-enlightenment whose lush gospelish backing vocals make this like George Michael's &quot;Father Figure&quot;.<br />Another ballad that melts my heart--&quot;Whenever You Call&quot;, and the piano and string synths accompany her voice, which is at one of her tenderest:  &quot;And I will always remember/part of you so tender/I'll be the one to catch your fall/whenever you call.&quot;  If my ideal one sang that to me....  It's tracks like this that make me wonder if Mariah shouldn't release an album called The Ballads Collection, and tracks like &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Fourth Of July&quot;, and &quot;Whenever You Call&quot;, written by her and Walter Afanasieff, should be included.<br />After a brief reprise of &quot;Butterfly&quot;, is a slowed down version of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;.  Dru Hill sings along with Mariah, and they are no Prince.  This is one of those times where a straight ahead cover with Mariah giving her all would've been ideal, just like she did with &quot;Open Arms.&quot;  The intensity with which Prince sings &quot;Do you want him or do you want me&quot; isn't replicated here.<br />&quot;Outside&quot; is the final lovely ballad and part of the chorus reflects the state I'm in now:  &quot;But in your heart/Uncertainty forever lies/And you'll always be/Somewhere on the outside.&quot;<br />Overall, a worthy effort spoiled by the first raindrops of what would be annoying guest-rapper time.  The storm would really hit with Glitter, but there'd be one more stop first...somewhere over the Rainbow.; is the final lovely ballad and part of the chorus reflects the state I'm in now:  &quot;But in your heart/Uncertainty forever lies/And you'll always be/Somewhere on the outside.&quot;<br />Overall, a worthy effort spoiled by the first raindrops of what would be annoying guest-rapper time.

B0000C7PQK|2.0|Ok, I will not do the step-by-step through all the song, but rather take a little dive into the Enigma concept. I am a sworn Enigma fan, and has been so since Enigma's first release in 1990. MCMXC a.D and Cross of Changes were unquestionably excellent albums. After that it has unfortunately been going downhill with Michael Cretu's creative skills. He once had a philosophy of breaking all the rules of creating music in order to create something new. I believe he stuck to this philosophy on the first two albums. After that I feel it started going downhill with his Enigma project. Ok, I admit there's a couple of good productions on Le Roi Est Mort and Screen Behind the Mirror. However, these albums were in my opinion not in the true and original spirit of Enigma (the intro on SBM is a blueprint of a Vangelis' Albedo). It's ok to change and go through a metamorphosis, but hey let's face it - it has been going the wrong way, and that is in particular the case for this album. I have all respect for Cretu as a composer and producer, but on Voyageur it seems like he's tired of the whole Enigma project. I may be completely wrong, but it seems to me like he's to the point where he just want to finish up the number of Enigma albums he got signed up for by the label and then move on with something else...<br />Voyageur is definitely the weakest Enigma album thus far. It sounds like something I could put together in my home studio in the matter of a few weeks (yes I do actually have some productions myself that sounds a lot better than any of the tracks on this album). That is actually the thing that is the most disappointing. Enigma used to be excactly what the name says, something magic, enigmatic, something untouchable, something I would never be able to make myself. Well, sad to say, it is no longer so. If you are a die hard enigma fan, you may want to get this album just to complete your collection. If not, you should stay clear. I've carefully listened to Voyageur about ten times now, and the album has yet not grown on me. MCMXC still sounds better every time I listen to it even today 13 years after its release. I really hope that all of the sudden Voyageur will do the same thing, but if it doesn't happen within the next 10 times I play the album, I am afraid to conclude that Cretu totally failed on this one. Now, if the album should grow on me, I will resubmit a new review and explain why it did... To you folks out there giving Voyageur 5 stars, I am happy for you. To me it was the greatest disappointment the week...
B000089CJI|5.0|I've had this album in heavy rotation for months.<br />My friend introduced me to these guys saying that they reminded him of Radiohead. Although I'm a HUGE Radiohead fan, I don't see much of a connection between the two groups.<br />With Postal Service, the music is catchy pop-rock covered in a thick blanket of electronica (think Ladytron with a touch of Grandaddy, or visa versa) and the vocals remind me of Erasure a bit.<br />Very clever lyrics and beats that get under your skin. It's one of those albums where you keep finding a new favorite song.<br />Buy it.
B000002G6J|5.0|This is a great album and Wave gives me instant good feelings from when I first heard it on the radio.<br />Antonio Carlos Jobim is one of the papas of the music form. Also recommend Jazz Samba Encore! by Stan Getz and Luiz Bonfa. For a newer artist, see Bebel Gilberto - Tanto Tempo.<br />Brazilian's have a gift of being winsome and Jobim is one of their finest examples.
B000002KIE|3.0|This album is fine, but nothing great. Whomever commented PIL is worse than the Pistols have not heard PIL. How can you hate PIL and find the Pistols listenable? Public Image Ltd were very accessable, unlike the harsh punk rock of the Sex Pistols. Heck, your mom might even like the band if she loves 80's pop music. I say Bollocks is an adequete listen, but Lydon needs a much more skillfull backup band and set of musical arrangements to make his songs great. Buy this album if you love punk. If you don't like punk then buy a Public Image Limited CD (&quot;Happy&quot; is best to start with).<br />Cheers!
B00009P1O5|1.0|The recent re-release of four of Neil Young's \\"lost\\" albums on CD begs the question why haven't they been released before? In the case of the quite brilliant \\"On the Beach\\" the answer is intriguing & complex but as far as \\"Re-ac-tor\\" goes it's very simple... it's not good. With the exception of some typically soaring vocals on \\"Southern Pacific\\" and some oddly satisfying syncopation on the frantic \\"Opera Star\\" & \\"Rapid Transit\\" it's boring & lackadaisical. Die-hard Neil Young fans might just find something worth the money in here but for anyone else it's a fairly effective confirmation of why treading through his highly erratic back catalogue is fraught with much wasted expense.
B00005JKZV|3.0|I saw this movie before I read The Lord of the Rings, and it was AMAZING!!  I loved it. . .then I read the book.  WHat was he thinking?  Extra scenes (never in the book) characters were portrayed differently, Faramir and Boromir seemed to have reversed roles, all I can think, is how on earth will they fix all their changes for the third movie?
B00003CXB4|4.0|I love this movie, for all of the reasons most everyone would list.  The new Morning Report song is not as strong as what was in that spot before.  I know why they had to do it in the broadway musical, but it was because of the limitations of the stage.  They took a strong bit of film animation and made it weak and campy.  This is not a Disney for small children, as I can still hear the little boy in the back of the theater saying, &quot;Is the Daddy dead?&quot; and repeatedly, then bursting into loud sobs.  But as an adult, I love this movie!
B000065V3H|1.0|I've been checking and checking and checking, hoping that the people at Disney would release a widescreen version of this great 80s film. However, it still has not materialized. The logic apparently is that &quot;family&quot; films should be released in fullscreen. However, Disney must surely realize that a large percentage of true film fans and collectors will refuse to purchase a pan and scan title. Because there has not been a new widescreen edition, I refuse to purchase this chopped release.
B00009P1O0|5.0|Here's a question: Why would a mainstream artist with well over 30 albums available on CD allow one of his best and most loved albums to remain deleted for over 20 years?... Difficult to understand at any level, not least of which is in terms of his appreciation of the demands of his fans.<br />Truth is (or appears to be) that Neil Young is exceedingly clever in manipulating the recording industry and his record buying public to maintain the enigmatic image on which much of his success is based. Fair conclusion?... well if this sounds too cynical there's good reason for it. Having just played my long awaited and newly acquired CD version of \\"On the Beach\\" for the first time in many years I'm simply blown away by it. Not just so much better than I remember from the days before I packed my record player & vinyl collection away in the loft but, in retrospect, one of his most cohesive, exciting & beautifully played albums - made all the better by its digital re-mastering. So... why on earth hold it back for so long?<br />If you're not a Neil Young fan you can safely ignore all of this and add this to your collection of \\"must have\\" albums from the 1970's. But, if you are, get it, revel in its brilliance, and then ponder whether an artist is justified in controlling the release of his recordings in the way he or we want.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I thought that this movie was absolutely hilarious. Will Ferrell cracked me up every time he was on camera. There are a couple of funny deleted scenes, and an Inside the Actor's Studio spoof on the DVD. Don't expect many differences from the rated version, though. This is definately a must-buy!
B000063UR1|4.0|Get ready to LAFF!<br />All the reasons that people cite for why this movie is flawed (shakey premise, preachy, maudlin, flat, Joan Baez theme song) are, in my opinion, reasons to love this film. If it hasn't aged particularly well, it has certainly survived as a hilarious sci-fi feature that is very much of its time. Dern's characterization of the psychotic tree-hugging Lowell is a joy to watch. When he preaches to his crewmates about the benefits of eating &quot;real food&quot; versus food pills (Ren &amp; Stimpy anyone??) as he scoops out his cantelope is mighty funny stuff. &quot;I grew it. I FIXED it.&quot; (Fixed it? = Hilarious.) Also, the little circular bumper pool table with the robot arm opponent thing is novel. Ha ha. And the high-speed 6-wheeled all-terrain vehicle joy ride through a warehouse of polystyrene octagonal storage pods is choice. Weeeee!<br />Trumball's effects are great by '70s standards. Not as spectacular as 2001: A Space Odyssey, but a might better than either Logan's Run or Battlestar Galactica that followed in later years. (I'd say it's comparable to Space: 1999) The establishing shot at the beginning of the film where we see Lowell standing in his kitchen window gazing out into the vastness of space, slowly pulling back to reveal the hull of the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; (his gigantic all-american eco-space ship, complete with geodesic domes) is stunning in its way, and very reminiscent of 2001. <br />Lastly, the &quot;drones&quot; Huey, Dewey and Louie are fascinating to watch. Like bulky air-conditioning units with articulated &quot;feet&quot; and flash-cube style sensors, cooling vents and grabby little pincher arms, the adorable drones waddle around the Valley Forge and fix things and water plants and - eventually - perform knee surgery on Dern. [Grisly!] Like R2D2, these robots contain live actors inside, and are made to seem very adorable and cute and childlike. When one of them is accidentally destroyed, the other two actually seem &quot;sad&quot;. It is a &quot;very special&quot; moment in a very special film. (Define &quot;special&quot; however you see fit.) Unlike R2D2, however, these robot costumes house not dwarf actors but full-sized amputee actors with no legs who walk on their hands. The visual effect is truly like nothing you've ever seen in a sci-fi film, or are likely to see again.
630460291X|4.0|This film is a `90s version of the classic Robin Hood story, with Kevin Costner starring as the good-guy thief. Costner is joined in his efforts against the murdering Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Richman) who once again proves why he makes an excellent villain. Richman  won best supporting actor in the British Academy Awards for his excellent roll.<br />Along with Morgan Freeman who plays a philosophizing side kick Azeem, and by Nick Brimble, who plays Little John (anything but little). After Robin barely survives a watery skirmish with Little John, the two become allies and Robin joins forces with Little John's band of robber thieves to overcome the evils of the Nottingham sheriff. <br />You don't really have to be a die-hard Robin Hood fan to enjoy this movie. The film has a few flaws and stretches the historical aspect somewhat but it plays out well with plenty of action, adventure, humor, and fun.<br />Robin Hood Price of Thieves was directed by Kevin Reynolds and produced by Warner Studios.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Sure this album needs a couple of listens before you really get into it.  As with most of the maiden fans, I bought it and was very dissapointed, but that was mainly because a had a closed mind upon it... just because it didn't sound like brave new world it doesn't mean it's bad.  It is actually quite the opposite, this album is no pop mainstream, you need and educated mind to listen to it and a critic ear to be able to discover it's strengh...  this is maiden with keyboards and strings, this is as close as maiden has come to progressive metal, much more than the classic seventh son... free your mind and listen to dance of death, you have nothing to lose and a masterpiece to gain, fan or not.
068484267X|4.0|It is hard to read this book and still think that life is tough.  Here is the story of a young man who is raised in the poorest of the poor in Limerick, Ireland who had to beg for food to eat, pick up coal off the streets for heat, write threatening letters to friends and family for extra money, and even help tear down a wall in his house to feed the fire.  It sure made me feel spoiled and appreciate the good life that I have.<br />I liked the stories.  Every childhood is this eventful, or at least should be.  You learn to like Frank McCourt and even identify with him as he questions the things in life, like the angel on the 7th step and religion in general.  You read as Frank McCourt spends years saving up money so he can do what his teacher urged him to do: Go to America where he can have more opportunity.<br />I loved this book and the movie did a very fair job of depicting the events of this book.  My only complaint is Mr. McCourt's lack of quotation marks.  Sometimes it is very hard to understand who is talking at a given time.  You can figure it out from the context, but you would expect more from an English teacher.  The quotation marks would have made it flow better.<br />However, I would not hesitate recommending this book to anybody.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Honestly I have never been so impressed with a story line that makes me crave it. I was introduced to Six Feet Under by my boyfriend, and just by telling me about the first episode I was already in awe....I would love it if everyone could take the time, and really enjoy this I know I have. It is very hard for me to choose a favorite character, everyone has such an neat personality that they portray, I am foaming at the mouth with excitement for the second season to come, I know I will be one of the many waiting impatiently in line.

B00005JLTM|4.0|I saw this movie the weekend it came out. When the film started, I was excited and blissful to be in the theater watching it the second night it was out. When the film ended, I was ready to leave.<br />   The plot is hard to follow but nevertheless if you understand it you will agree that it is a good plot. The machines are drilling into the underground city of Zion, and Neo finally gets a chance to destroy the machines and save mankind. Not so simple though. Neo must choose to save Trinity or to enter the machine mainframe and end the war for good. Guess which he chooses.<BR>   The fight scenes are toooooo long. The Burley Brawl and Freeway Chase were impressive but should have been cut shorter. The 2 albino twins and Morpheus were awesome. <BR>   The whole logical mind talks were sooo stupid and could confuse the brightest philosopher. The talks with the Oracle and the Architect were senseless.<BR>   And the conclusion......it all happens so fast. Neo can control the machines outside of the Matrix but goes into a coma by doing so.......and another unknown character is konked out with him after it is revealed that the new character is the only survivor when the machines break into a pipeline leading into Zion. Who is this new character? I could not figure it out it happened so fast. I think it may have been the human Agent Smith, I know he is in Revolutions as a human. <BR>   A preview.....Revolutions includes Neo conversing with the machines over the unstoppable uncontrolable Agent Smith, the machines braking into Zion, and Neo duking it out for the last time against Agent Smith.

6305399212|5.0|Aliens is one of my favorite films ever and has to be among the greatest movies ever made.  It's a film that I want to see again and again, because it provides a thrilling plot with terrific storytelling.  When I first saw Aliens I was scared out of my wits, had nightmares for two weeks, and swore I would never see it again.  But I did see it again, and things changed.  It's a freaky, suspenseful flick the first time around, after that it's just enjoyable.<br />Aliens is the sequel to Alien, which was an OK film, but not as good as its sequel.  After Aliens came two horrindous follow ups that were crappy and not thought through very well.  So I have to say this is the best Aliens film out there and I don't recommend the others, except maybe the first.<br />Aliens takes place 50+ years after Ripley's run in with the first of what turns out to be many Aliens.  She learns that the world in which the alien she had encountered came from has been colonized by colonists.  One thing leads to another, and Ripley finds herself on another mission this time accompanied by marines.  Well as you can imagine, all hell will break loose.<br />Ripley's character is unbelievabley real.  I think Sigourney Weaver will forever be tight casted for these kind of dark roles, even though I believe she is a better actress than what most think.  But she envelopes the character Ripley so well, it's the perfect role for her.  Ripley is the female version of John Wayne: no nonsense, do it herself, take charge kind of person.  Other female leads have attempted to do this as well in other movies, but mostly aren't as successful due to the unrealness of their characters.  But Ripley's female \\"machoism\\" works because it's believable, and that's because she's a great actress.<br />You have other characters like Bien who plays Hicks, one of the few marines that get along with Ripley.  There's Burke, played by comedian Paul Reiser, who is this sleezy pencil pusher out to make a buck on everyone's demise.  And Hudson, played by Bill Paxton, a whiner who uses the \\"F\\" word in almost every sentence.  A great mix of characters who all bring conflict to both the plot and each other.<br />But besides the characters and plot and suspense, that isn't necessarily what makes Aliens so great.  What makes it great is that it's a pioneer of a film.  And I don't mean special effects.  Science fiction combined with horror has had dismal performances in the past, present, and probably future.  But Aliens is a success because it combines these two genres into one movie and creates realistic, and comprehensible events within this unrealistic storyline.  In other words, it makes the unreal suddenly real to us all.  This is the mark of a truely good movie, especially if it is sci-fi or horror.  <br />This is accomplished by good acting as well as great directing.  It is also accomplished when the intensity of the plot never fades, it keeps you on your toes, and this is done by giving multiple problems for the characters of the films to solve.  And this film is a problem solver film 101: <BR>problem 1: find the aliens.  <BR>problem 2: find a way to kill the aliens<BR>problem 3: find a way to survive from the aliens<BR>problem 4: find a way to escape from the aliens<br />Boom, boom, boom, boom.  One problem to hurdle right after another.  Great storytelling, with believable characters, with the aid of intensity through compelling problems.  Most horror films lack at least one of these.  Aliens does not.  <br />The only thing I recommend to beware of is the excessive cussing in this film.  In some cases I find it over used and unnecessary.  But that's Hollywood for you.  The violence isn't so bad, despite what you may have heard.  I don't think you'll be disappointed in this film, at least after the second time around.  It's a film that will amaze you, terrify you, and entertain you like no other.<br />Grade: A

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's songs on this cd are definitly all ranged. Some of the songs sound like funk, some are pop, melodic, and some are even a bit jazzy. Another great fact about the CD is that no one song is just like that last. Each song is unique. The lead vocalist has a great range of sound and I like that the group uses a wide range of musical instruments. This is why Maroon 5 is a great band because they sing and play their own instruments, not like some boy band that rely only on looks and high pitched voices. This is a great CD for anytime.
B000002H33|5.0|There isn't much to say about this album that hasn't already been said. A true masterpiece which all metal fans should own. The album displays Metal at its greatest. Every track including Master of Puppets, Orion and Battery delivers raw power mixed with great musical harmony. This album displays what metal at its greatest would sound like. MOP really shows the great talent of Metallica and what they were capable of in the 80's. Also look into Ride the Lightning, Kill 'em All, Justice and Black Album.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is the cd to own. This cd just proves that Linkin Park is not a one hit wonder. The band pulls all out for this cd. My favorite song is &quot;Faint&quot;.
B000002UDB|5.0|One of the most underrated albums in the Beatles catalog, they seem to have sucked LSD from sugar cubes (especially George). The first half of the album is comprised of great selections from their so-so TV movie (actually it wasn't all that bad!). The second half has a few single songs that changed the face of pop music forever. I especially love &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;. I like to sing that song in order to drown bad music (i.e. N*Sync) out of my head. The album ends with one of the most powerful anthems of all time, complete with an orchestra and choir. Some copies even come with a brief summary of the Magical Mystery Tour film, complete with photos and colorful illustrations. I especially the cool, outbouncing cover.<br />Recommended editions (which I own):<BR>-Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab LP (MFSL 1-047)<BR>-Japanese LP (Apple EAS-80569)<BR>-Russian CD, coupled with Revolver (CDM 0500-429) [it's the only CD edition that comes with the complete artwork]
B0000AQVCL|5.0|to start off, great cd. some minor flaws though. songs get repetetive and boring. otherwise great rockin album that will have songs in your head for hours.
B000089QEN|5.0|I have never read the novel of &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; however, I LOVED the DVD.  Natasha Little stars as Becky Sharp a scheming (but oh so wickedly beautiful), governess. Becky tries, and eventually succeeds in netting herself a fortune as well as several, rich lovers.  Becky's cold ruthless cunning alienates herself from those she loves, and lands herself into trouble time and time again, but Becky succeeds in extricating herself from each misadventure with delicious results.<br />This movie is for those who love the regency period, and would delight in watching a heroine who thumbs her nose at convention, and is the antithesis of 'sweet, naive and innocent.'
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I just happened to see this at the Virgin record store the other day, and I happily picked it up. I was excited all day by the new Enigma album, I couldn't wait till I had time to listen to it.<br />I was expecting something different, because that's what good artists do (not beating their style to death). That's what we got. The opening track &quot;From East To West&quot; brought us into familiar territory, very lush. But the rest of the tracks are definitly different. My favorite tracks so far are &quot;From East To West&quot; for its lush sound, &quot;Page Of Cups&quot; for the beat, &quot;In The Shadow, In The Light&quot; for the melody/bass line, and &quot;Following The Sun&quot; for being to most 'bangin' track on the cd (it has kind of a fun folk-like sound to it).<br />Granted it's not going to be like his first 3 albums, and if you can except that then you'll be able to enjoy this one no problem. I'm guessing this is more of a creeper album, the more I listen to it, the more I like it. Like a lot of people are saying, it's more like the first Enigma album, very beat driven.<br />But if you're wanting more of the original Enigma sound, I highly reccommend the SILENT HILL 3 soundtrack that comes bundled with the game. Lots and lots of lush stuff on that soundtrack regardless of the video game's dark horror content. (go out and rent the game from a local Blockbuster, the cd comes with the game, and you can copy it. Muuhahahaaa)
8440619537|5.0|This book was way ahead of its time when written.  It is more about prejudice and not liking people because they look different, than a monster story.  The \\"monster\\" created by Frankenstein is actually a very complex character with deep thoughts about philosophy and life in general.  He strives for the acceptance of his creator who virtually abandons him.  The book has virtually no similarity to the movie later produced with Boris Karloff.<br />The only problem I have with the book is that Shelly never tells you how the monster is created (unlike the \\"it's alive\\" scene with lightening and electrodes that made up the movie).  A true classic that will never get old.
B00006EXCC|4.0|\\"Aftermath\\" is a somewhat disjointed album.  It's held up by its standout tracks and bogged down by some uninspired ones.  However, it's not to be overlooked and is definitely one of the best pre-Beggars Banquet albums the group released. <br />The albums starts off strong with \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Lady Jane\\", and \\"Under My Thumb\\".  All of these songs are great.  The instrumenation, vocals, production writing--these are worthy listens.  The album then takes a weak turn with the next few tracks, \\"Doncha Bother Me\\", \\"Goin' Home\\" (which is about 7 minutes too long), \\"Flight 505\\", and \\"High And Dry\\".  All of these songs are rather enjoyable but more or less completely forgettable, save the line in \\"Flight 505\\": \\"But suddenly it dawned on me that this was not my life\\", one of my favorite little bits of wisdom in a pop song.  The album looks up again with the absolutely excellent \\"Out Of Time\\", \\"I Am Waiting\\", and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\".  In between these songs are some more enjoyable-but-forgettable tunes.<br />I would recommend you buy Aftermath for the great songs that are on here and ignore the clunkers.  Besides, you might find other tracks you like on the disc.  It's a pity they didn't include \\"Paint It Black\\" on this release, allowing the listener to sequence this album to hear it as he chooses, US or UK.  In any event, the UK version is recommended, as in the US listners lost 4 tracks in favor of \\"Paint It Black\\", which is great but widely available.

B00000DFSK|4.0|There's no doubt that this is a great collection, but like most &quot;hits&quot;, there's a few things that keep it from being 5 star. The only thing from &quot;October&quot; is the hidden track, which is the song &quot;October&quot;. Also the song &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; I never cared for much. If they really wanted four tracks from &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, they should have gone with the live &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;. Besides being amazing, it was on &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; as well. That would make more sense. Otherwise, this is an excellent collection for the casual fan. If you're a fanatic, I really suggest finding the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; with b-sides. Those are as good as the a-sides, and that's a 5 star &quot;best of&quot;.
020161622X|5.0|This is an excellent book containing many points that every programming should be noting in one way or another.<br />In some cases, it's perhaps stating the obvious or what you think may be the obvious but I was surprised how I found myself very guilty of not bothering with such simple things.<br />I think every programmer should read this book, and even a simple program of trying to adopt or take on the occassional pragmatic practice every few weeks would be a great thing for us all to do!<br />I'd like to make sure every programmer I work with has read this book.
B000002GK1|4.0|Their earlier albums may have been more grunge, or even punk, but this is no doubt a metal album. Closer to &quot;Pantera&quot; than &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;. This got them more attention then &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; did, and includes the tracks &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot;, and &quot;Outshined&quot;. All three awesome songs. But I think the masterpiece here is &quot;Searching With My Good Eye Closed&quot;. From front to back, that's a headphones classic. Not everything on here is great, but most of it rocks. Fanatics may want to find the very limited edition of this called &quot;SOMMS&quot;. It comes with an extra 5-track disc. Anyone looking for their first, or only &quot;Soundgarden&quot; cd, should just get &quot;A-Sides&quot;.
1400034779|5.0|I read this book to my 93 year old father.  Pretty soon he was telling me he wasn't quite sleepy and hinting for another chapter.  The connection that Mma Ramotswe had with her father while he was alive and even after his death was beautiful and I am sure was even more meaningful to a very old, loving father who may now think that his love will go on after he is gone.  I will start the next book on my next visit and he can't wait.  Good luck on pronouncing the names!
B000001GK9|2.0|This recording of Mahler's 9th symphony is commonly clearly overrated; the hysterical praise it gets from some reviewers might make people think that this CD is \\"the definitive\\" Mahler 9, as if such a thing is possible. But there is nothing definitive about it, at least not as a Mahler recording.<br /><br />Because - as many reviewers already have noted - Karajan's interpretation is basically a lightweight and superficial version of Mahler 9, quite typical for his style in almost any interpretation. It is thus a \\"showpiece Mahler\\" not reaching the interpretational depths and violent expressiveness that we for instance can hear in Klemperer's 1967 powerful recording with the NPO. I suppose this problem somehow is rooted in Karajan himself. Recall Furtw&auml;ngler's remark on Karajan, \\"His conducting is over-nuanced and individual voices are over-emphasised\\". While emphasizing details, apparently for showing off, Karajan neglects the musical structure.<br /><br />The price is another drawback: you can get two very fine and famous recordings of Mahler 9 for the price of this one (e.g. Ancerl, Abbado)! So why waste your money on this overrated record?<br /><br />Klemperer's (EMI), Ancerl's (Supraphon) and Walter's (SONY) recordings of this work are my three first more or less \\"objective\\" recommendations (many professional reviewers share my view) - and you'll find them all at midprice (Walter's is included in a SONY midprice Mahler box). Furthermore, Giulini (DG) is one of my personal favs: excellent playing and a great, powerful interpretation in excellent sound. Horenstein's dark account (BBC Legends) is also worth a serious consideration, despite the playing flaws. Finally, Abbado's live account (DG) can be considered for those who want superb digital sound and a very fine interpretation, with the same orchestra as in Karajan's performance but much better on all accounts.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney has had a hit-and-miss approach with DVDs. So I'm pleased to say that The Lion King like many of their newest releases looks spectacular and sets the standard for the way DVDs should look and sound. In many respects Lion King is the royalty of Disney DVDs as (until recently)it was the highest grossing film with spin offs in every direction. So it's only appropriate that it be packed with royal extras. It is.<br />You get the original theatrical vesion and the Special Edition with an additional song and animation added to the film. The resolution is terrific here; Disney went back and inked and animated some these sequences after putting together the IMAX version. They realized that the film might not look as great on IMAX (the digital painting and other digital touches weren't quite high enough resolution to my understanding). So vs. releasing a substandard product, Disney opted to redo portions of the film. I didn't see any noticeable differences between the original (which I still have on laserdisc)and the special edition. By far the best looking of the two is still the DVD.<br />The extras are terrific as well with audio commentary, deleted scenes and other fun bits to be discovered. I could have done without the Disney Stars performing The Circle of Life--it seemed to me to be a cheap commerical for another Disney product. I'm still a bit annoyed that everytime the DVD starts you have to select to start the film otherwise it automatically plays all the coming attractions commericals.<br />It's already a Disney classic. Now if they would just get around to Aladin on DVD. Why that one's taking so long is beyond me and, technically speaking, it should have come out before The Lion King. At least most of them are finally available on DVD so that's a plus. Highly recommended.
6304779356|3.0|\\"The Lost Boys\\" is an average teeny bopper flick from the 80's.  It's notable only for a couple of decent performances, some funny one-liners, and one of the first gay protagonists in a teen movie history.  Corey Haim's character is supposed to be gay!  The film never tells you this, but drops hints all over the place.  Look at the flamboyent way he dresses.  He has no interest in women and, in fact, gets annoyed with his older brother for chasing after the stunning Jami Gertz.  He sings a woman's song in the tub.  And how about that poster of a half-clad Rob Lowe in his bedroom?  (In 1987, no heterosexual teenage boy in his right mind would have had a picture of a half-naked Rob Lowe in his bedroom!)  Director Joel Schummacher is out and I have no question that he meant for this character to be gay.  Although, I do wonder if he told poor Corey Haim about this decision.  (Speaking of poor Corey.  The last I heard he attempted to sell his teeth and hair on E-Bay in order to raise money for his pain-killer drug habit.)
0385504209|5.0|I was really surprised in reading the reviews not to see more complaints about the nature of this book and some of the assertions in it.  The book itself is almost a text book of how to hold a reader's interest while the author delivers large amounts information about old and arcane subjects necessary for the story line to hold together that the reader did not realize until right then that they had an interest in finding out more about.  Some of plot points are a bit contrived, but by then you really don't mind because you just want to find out where this very interesting mind is leading you.<br /> While not a Catholic, I did find that the book bashed more often and more heavily than I thought was necessary a noble and important faith.  On the other hand in the last 2000 or so years some people have done some literally unforgivable things on behalf of faith and the Church.  So a balance of truth is the question and there the author gets the benefit of the doubt in order to tell his story, and what a story it is.  I will not give it away, but to include the movie Eyes Wide Shut and Leonardo da Vinci in a story that begins with the story of Christ and ends in present day Paris is quite an achievement.  The author does tie it all together.  He faithfully, if at times obviously follows the rule that, if there is a gun on the table in the first act it most certainly goes off in the third, and again behind the curtain as it drops.  Great stuff this.

B00005A46T|4.0|Slipknot's second album is a relentless aggressive assualt of sound. It is much more unforgiving and heavy than their self-titled debut. Personally, I still favor S/T [Slipknot's first album]over Iowa due to the fact that the first disc offered much more variety whether it be Corey Taylor's range of vocals or the sound of the band in general. Nevertheless, Iowa represents the epitome of Slipknot's success, and that is to cash in on the expense of teenage animosity.<br />The work shown on Iowa outlines the foundation of talent in Slipknot. Corey Taylor represents the heart of this nine member monster of a band. His blaring vocals accompanied by his ferocious lyrics is what drives this group forward and gives them direction. However, at rare times when he shows off his singing [best exemplified by tracks such as &quot;My Plague&quot;, &quot;Left Behind&quot; and part of &quot;Disasterpiece&quot;], Taylor can bring out more emotions than the loudest of his screams. Next to Taylor, the foundation of Slipknot is depended on the amazing drumming abilities of Joey Jordison. Much similar to S/T, Joey conveys that he is the groundwork of this band and shows it through his unique time-signatures, incredible speed, power, and persistant precision in his beats. The guitarists Mick Thompson and James Root have really stepped up on this record by adding more guitarwork upfront to accompany the clamorous percussion. However, in Iowa, the turntables of Sid Wilson and sampling/media use of Craig Jones have been dramatically reduced. This I believe, hurt the band and is the main feeling of emptyness I receive when listening to Iowa. Chris Fehn, and Shawn Crahan's roles are limited as well and are only trully shown through Slipknot's live performances. <br />There are many decent tracks on Iowa. Only questionable ones include songs such as &quot;Everything Ends&quot; because of it's over-repetitiveness and &quot;Skin Ticket&quot;, which basically just lacks structure. Many fans find the title track to be tedious and tasteless, but surprisingly, I appreciate the different approach they took. In addition, lack of diversity is probably what sets this album apart from S/T. The lyrics as brutal and disturbing as they seem, are well done in Slipknot fashion, although the chorus to &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; may seem silly at first. &quot;The Shape&quot; is the standout track on Iowa, and is evident of what Slipknot can accomplish when all members work to their maximum potential. Taylor delivers a good discrepancy between his singing and shouting in the chorus, Joey's drumming couldn't be better and the guitarists helps stress the percussion with the their steady, intense strings. <br />Although Slipknot intended to produce an album which reflected more of their &quot;metal&quot; roots, what they've failed to realize was that they've lost the sound which initially made them unique, innovative and fresh. While adding more layers of guitars and louder lyrics, Slipknot has actually unconciously stripped down their musical creativity. When juxtaposed against S/T, Iowa may disappoint older fans but when viewed in a different light, Iowa itself stands out as a solid recording which emphasizes thrash and angst to their climax.<br />- aZnXgIn
B0000C7PQK|4.0|There are a lot of good sounds here, but it doesn't go far enough. The album is beat-driven (Jen's influence again?). There is no booklet or anything else to tell the listener who sings what. The thing I find most annoying are the bad breaks between songs.
B000002I6T|5.0|This is David's first solo album (with help from Nash &amp; Young and a host of others) and it contains some wonderful songs: Laughing, Song With No Words and Tamalpais High really stand out.
B000089RVX|1.0|Generally, in order to convey my disgust for modern whiny-baby music --which sadly saturates the upper percentile of the market-- I simply compose a review here on good ole amazon.com.  Well, I am confident that if you listen to this monotone-voiced, melody-starved, banal, 80s rock-rap with that typical, laughable, disastrous piano ballad (&quot;My Immortal&quot;), then my point will be made.  I'll only expand briefly using words, for I am optomistic that this garbage of some mutant strain can be quickly discarded after one listening, rather than by mighty keystrokes.<br />1) THE VOICE:  The voice, the voice, the voice.  I don't know who told this girl she possessed talent to carry a tune; perhaps it was some cruel joke.  Or perhaps her level of talent matched that of her bandmates.  If the latter is true, then I completely understand.  <br />     The Skinny: A slender range consisting of about three notes...  possibly the most boring set of notes on the keyboard.  Additionally, those notes are held for the longest times, the singer attempting in vain to persuade the ignorant listeners that because she can hold a boring note for several seconds, blending seamlessly into the next boring note a half-step away, that she is a diva.  Don't be fooled by what the media and the music conglomerates tell you, folks: 'That kind of voice that induces insomnia,' or '...A haunting voice'.  The fact is her voice is of extremely low caliber, synonomous with the chubby high school choir girl who has no concept of melody, but rather the cringing ability to bellow meaningless tunes for unforseeable, excrutiating loads of time (which for some reason qualifies many these days to be considered talented).<br />2) THE &quot;MUSIC&quot;: Bombastic.  Egotistical.  The singer's motives are clearly different than those of her bandmates.  4/4 beat, 80s rock-rap (as heard on &quot;Bring Me Back to Life&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;) and 4/4 beat, late 90s/00s cookie cutter-cliche-rock (asheard on &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;), first of all, is not &quot;haunting&quot;.  Those types of beats, coupled with adolescent low-chord guitar rifs --done millions of times, mind you-- were originally intended to sound aggressive, and to be complemented by an aggressive voice; this vocalist does not land in this category, or any category at all for that matter.  Perhaps the type of music suited for this fakir would have been along the lines of Sarah McLachlan, who possesses the vocal range to effectively convey &quot;haunting&quot; emotions, as well as a brain that tells her that her voice would not sound good over Godsmack.  <br />Overall, this concoction is a horrible mess, reeking of the foulest of smells due to a chemical reaction gone awry.

B0000001PW|5.0|It's not jazz, it's not rock - it's fusion folks! Somehow this genre came and went and only held onto a \\"cult\\" following, which never made any sense to me.  This proves the beginning of the breakdown of art when assimilated with the American mainstream.  Instead of pointing fingers, why don't we praise this album!<br />This album succeeds on many different levels.  First off, it's music only Chick can make.  He's got his own style and feel (and that brain!!!) and way of composing.  Innovation and originality take him way above the rest.  Then there's his playing.  It's highly skilled and busy, but it all stays within the paramters of his intentions.  Music on all levels - melody, harmony, dynamics, timbre, etc. - make this project very unique.  Again, it's not jazz, but it's an indescribable blend of styles that only someone like Chick can make.  It's the best thing this side of progrock.  <br />The only thing that may turn listeners away (not me though!) is the use of timbre.  The \\"1986-ness\\" is inescapable, meaning that fusion here did exactly what it was supposed to - put a jazz brain into rock production and feel.  Which to me is one of the best combinations there is.  But for this album, be advised, the rock production is alive and well here - ok, it's oozing all over.  The synth sounds are very 80's - if very Chick.  Some of the snare sounds have a big gated verb, and the guitars are distinctive of the period as well.  If you flat-out hate 80's rock, this album may be questionable for you.<br />My own personal complaint (though not all that huge) is the ironic lack of structure in an overly structured effort.  Each of the 99 trillion notes here are often placed in a well planned out fashion, but some songs as a whole do have the \\"jazz syndrome\\", i.e. they go on for quite awhile, and one gets lost as to where they are in the song unless one is tuned in to the musical \\"conversation\\", which often requires much effort.  That's a side effect of the otherwise nobleattempt to combine the freedom of jazz into an almost song-like format.  The only thing that helps you stay with it is either a) having the audio actually memorized in your head (which I do since I've listened to this 8 million times) or b) like with the purpose of jazz, staying with the \\"communication\\" of the soloist.  It's just that that is very hard to do with the music of Chick Corea, as his brain is on another planet.  Sometimes it's also very difficult to stay with the rhythms of genius drummer Dave Weckl.  Thus, I probably give this an aesthetic rating of 4 stars, though since that is just my inferior brain talking, there's no reason to call this anything less than a 5 star accomplishment.<br />For proof of my minor interjections, first try on the great successes \\"Side Walk\\" and \\"Elektric City\\" for starters.  They have all the aforementioned elements of ChickFusion, but they are short and/or have great feel (check out those guitar riffs!).  Hands down, they pull off what fusion sets out to do.  My favorite songs in the world are over 10 minutes long, but with a jazzer you gotta be careful - next, check out \\"King Cockroach\\" and \\"Silver Temple\\" for comparison - Nice build-ups make up for their midsong noodlings, but it gets a bit unnecessarily strectched to around 7 and 9 minutes, respectively.  Ironic that this \\"what-is-going-on-noodling\\" is the very thing that rock guitar solos get blamed for, when I find most of those highly emotional.  Basically, it comes down to this; maybe some songs need to be 24 minutes long.  But as a craftsman of songs myself, I follow rule number one; when the song tells you it's done, end it.<br />Many metalheads claim the more you think, the more you interfere with the point of music.  That I will defend.  Chick Corea may be on another level, but NOBODY deserves to be blamed for how much is in his or her brain.  Intellectual stimulation IS a key component to many people's music.<br />A lot of work went into this recording.  Whatever you think, there's no denying that a) you would be well-off to own this nomatter who you are and b) Chick is the man.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I remember when I was a young boy when this movie first came out. I saw it in the theatres THREE TIMES IN A ROW, it was just that good. And I didn't stop there. I took home the soundtrack and I was one of the first to get it on VHS. This is one of the best movies Disney has ever made, if not the best. The story is captivating, and very emotional. The music is very good (you'll find yourself singing along to Elton John's songs) , the characters are memorable, cute, lovable and funny, and you will want Simba to win against his evil uncle Scar.

This CD is about 20 years old now, but it sure doesn't show it. ST's lyrics are a depressing yet energetic look at how the goverment sucks, how they feel suicidal, how it sucks to be controlled and repressed, and basically how life can really suck sometimes. The things that ST sung about in this album still apply to today. Even audio-wise this CD sounds excellent. Anyone else who listens to older punk knows how some CDs really do show the limitations of their recording studios in their time. The best songs are &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, &quot;I Saw Your Mommy...&quot;, &quot;I Want More&quot;, and &quot;Suicidal Failure&quot;.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Okay, before you get this movie (and you should!), it's definitely NOT for children because it's excessively violent at some points. Make them watch My Neighbor Totoro instead, another of Miyazaki's great films.<br />*SPOILERS BELOW, BUT JUST BUY THE MOVIE!*<BR>That said, this is an enchanting, riveting tale about a boy who has to overcome the demonic disease festering in his hand after a battle with a giant boar that could potentially kill him if he doesn't hurry. Surprisingly, it grants him incredible killing strength (there's one scene where he beheads a man just by shooting an arrow at him). He meets San, a girl raised by wolves, who tries to protect the forest from the evil Lady Eboshi. War erupts between the humans and the boar tribe, but Miyazaki demonstrates that the overwhelming power of nature is superior to that of collective human strength, and both sides find closure after they restore everything back to its proper place.
B000001EL3|5.0|It doesn't matter if you're into the smooth Californian sounds of Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles, proggers like Yes and Genesis or the harder edged stuff of the 70's, this is an album that nobody should be without.<br />First off, I would like to say that I hate Kiss.  Can't stand them.   I find the majority of their music borderline retarded.  I have to hear them at work all the time, my boss loves them.  Every Kiss album he's played for me I've found to be either unlistenably cheesy (most of the 80s ones, Carnival Of Souls, Psychocircus) or laugh-out-loud stupid (Rock And Roll Over, Dynasty, The Elder), despite having a couple standout tracks on some of them.     <br />After hearing this I scratched my head, wondering why Bob Ezrin wasn't made a permanant band member!  Every track on here is classic and it's just jam packed with classic Kiss tunes.  You get Gene's concert staple &quot;God Of Thunder,&quot; Peter Criss's gigantic hit ballad &quot;Beth&quot; and the most memorable tunes ever penned by Paul Stanley in the form of &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;King Of The Nightime World.&quot; And hell, it's got &quot;Do You Love Me&quot; too!  If you've never bothered putting on a Kiss album before chances are high that you already know and love at least half of these songs.  <br />This all goes without mentioning their most hilarious, over the top piece of music ever in the form of the pompous ode to groupies &quot;Great Expectations&quot; sung by Gene in a raspy, hilariously off-key voice.   On top of that the song also includes a full orchestra and backing by a boys choir.  It's so corny yet giddily glorious at the same time.  It's my favorite Kiss song.<br />If you own no other Kiss records (and I actually reccomend NOT owning any other ones besides live ones or compilations) it's 100% essential to have this in your collection.  It's the funnest record ever.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The modern radio era is dominated by bands that fancy themselves latter-day Sex Pistols but sound more like bad Green Day knockoffs. Into this musical climate, A Perfect Circle has injected a potent breath of fresh air with its sophomore effort, Thirteenth Step.<br />The record doesn't overpower the listener. It has a quietness, a subtlety that makes it nearly impossible to fully appreciate on first listen. But with each subsequent listen, its layers are uncovered, slowly and deliciously. It's a masterpiece that comes full circle on the promise of the band's debut, Mer de Noms.<br />Thirteenth Step can be taken as a concept album of sorts, with each of the twelve songs exploring a different aspect of psychology and addiction. Opener &quot;The Package&quot; draws you in with quiet guitars and beats and Maynard James Keenan's gorgeous vocals. He's an addict looking for his next fix, and we're along for the ride as the music and voice go from an urgent whisper to a desperate growl and back again. It sets the stage for the journey to come.<br />The first single, &quot;Weak and Powerless,&quot; is a standout. Like much of the record, it's clearly influenced by the new wave of the late 80's and early 90's -- there are points at which Keenan's voice seems to channel that of the Cure's Robert Smith -- yet strikingly original. It's disarming, with a haunting quality that carries throughout the record.<br />The musicianship is impressive. From band founder/guitarist Billy Howerdel to drummer Josh Freese to new bassist Jeordie White, there isn't a weak link. White, in particular, is a revelation. His confident, driving bass lines are just the right counterpart to Freese's rhythms; who knew that such a fine musician lurked within the former Twiggy Ramirez? The music and vocals both prove capable of holding back when appropriate, making the moments when they explode all the more powerful. The band is tight, skilled and creative.<br />As we've come to expect from Keenan in APC orhis other project, Tool, the lyrics are cryptic, metaphorical and beautiful. They are consistently powerful, intelligent and thought-provoking as they explore the darker subject matter.<br />Among the quieter, more atmospheric tracks, &quot;The Noose&quot; stands out with its haunting guitars and poignant lyrics. The band showcases its sense of humor on Failure cover &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me,&quot; with Keenan stepping into character as the sad, delusional patient. The song is stark and surpising. String instruments provide an understated, elegant sound, and Keenan conveys just the right vulnerability and pathos.<br />There are heavier songs, too, and they are some of the best on the record. &quot;The Outsider&quot; is the most powerful, musically and lyrically, with Keenan's angry vocals lashing out and tearing loose. &quot;Pet&quot; can be taken as a political commentary on post-9/11 America and the war on terror; the music hits just the right notes from heavy to scary to gentle, to coincide with the alternately reassuring, commanding and ironic tone of the lyrics and vocals.<br />Perhaps the record as a whole is the recovery, the thirteenth step. It lingers in your mind and your soul, long after it closes with the oddly uplifting lines, &quot;Heal me/lift me back up to the sun/I choose to live.&quot;
B000001ELP|1.0|Kiss were already bad enough before they dipped their toes into the concept album territory.   Not satisfied with their already hit-or-miss career, they decide to tip the scales in favor of the misses with The Elder.<br />Actually, what they're doing here isn't much different then what they've done on most of their other albums, which was putting on one or two really good songs and filling the rest up with with either uninsteresting, mediocre songs or absolute garbage.  What makes this one the most laughable of them all is the fact that they thought they had created a serious piece of musical art!  <br />There is one good song, which is &quot;World Without Heroes.&quot;  Gene actually sings this one really well and is a great, haunting slower song.  &quot;Dark Light&quot; (yeah, that makes sense) could have been great had it had different lyrics and if Ace Frehly wouldn't have sung it, who sings just as bad as he looks without his makeup.  <br />If you aren't a fan, stay far FAR away from this.  Try their monumental, hit-and-concert-staple-packed Destroyer album.   If you're looking for some unintention humor Kiss's &quot;Rock And Roll Over&quot; should be your first choice.   If you are a Kiss completist, I'm sorry that you have to spend your money on this!  <br />If you happen to be looking for a good concept album, try these<br />Genesis &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;<BR>Queensryche &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot;<BR>Dream Theater &quot;Scenes From A Memory<BR>Pink Floyd &quot;Animals&quot;  &quot;The Wall&quot; &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;<BR>Gentle Giant &quot;In A Glass House&quot;<BR>Wasp &quot;The Crimson Idol&quot;<br />Just kidding on that last one!
B000089RVR|5.0|What an amazing album, Dido has done it again!  Right now i cant think of a better singer/songwriter who understands how to match her wonderful lyrics with her beautiful voice.  This album is different from &quot;No Angel&quot; but overall a more complete and better album.  Every song is wonderful.  Do yourself a favor and buy this cd today!
B000005RQT|5.0|This one is a 25th remastered version 1996 of the original 1970's album with some new bonus tracks, chats, band outtakes from Roger Glover.<BR>DP IN ROCK was originally released in 1970 by EMI in the UK & it reached number 1 in the english chart, during the LP only reached number 143 in the States at that time. What did the Yankees think about this \\"Hard rock made in heaven\\" album?? firstly, a disgusting commodity?? oh come on, of course not!!! DP always made a good music......Ian Gillan is my good \\"scream\\" singer, Jon Lord is my fave organist, Roger Glover whose own a very excellent technic of bass playing, Ian Paicey is the best hard rock drummer of the world & Blackmore is my timeless guitar hero. Need I say more??<BR>Please just ask the other DP fans? they will answer you the same
B00005JLKB|4.0|Great shows, but WOW, what average sound and video...  For a show that I think was broadcast in HighDef, it seems nearly impossible that the DVD looks so unimpressive.  Last I checked WB was a recording company...  Man, if the show wasn't soooo good I'd return the discs.  Video is unsharp, overly high contrast in dark areas, and the sound is like an old stereo DVD mix (Like Highlander if you know what I mean).  I have a 36&quot; WEGA and audiophile quality sound system so its not that.  Oh well, Lana looks good on a black and white TV so I give points for that.  Hah.
B000001E18|4.0|When this came out it definitely was not U2 as they had come to be known.  Nope.  Gone were the politically charged songs, the anthemic rhythms and power chords, and Bono's angst ridden vocals.  U2 had gone pop.  They knew it.  They played into it.  And most people missed the point.  <br />Reflecting back on this some years later, it makes much more sense.  Brian Eno whips out his signature atmospheric sounds which leads towards the conclusion of where U2 was headed anyhow: Pop.  The synthesized sound that so dominates this album is what throws the curve ball we didn't really see coming, albeit in hindsight.  <br />Totally and completely immersed into the culture about which they were trying to awaken on its prior albums, U2 dove right into irony.  If you dig into the album and really listen to the lyrics you'll find this album much more autobiographical than the others.  It represents a turning point, a period of dormancy if you will, a sluggishness that represents a group in flux. <br />\\"And I have no religion<BR>And I don't know what's what<BR>And I don't know the limit<BR>The limit of what we got.\\" -- Zooropa<br />'Numb' is perhaps a fitting choice of songs to reflect where they were at the time.  This isn't to say it is a bad album.  Not at all.  This is simply U2 experimenting.  And it works.<br />The Edge sings, Bono discovers falsetto and U2 goes electronica.  It's worth digging into, especially for The Wanderer with Johnny Cash.  Not only does this song reflect Bono's spiritual truth, it dives right into Johnny Cash territory.  How much more fitting a symbol of the paradox of American culture than Johnny Cash on a U2 album produced by Brian Eno?
B0000BWVCM|4.0|X-2 is a rarity for hollywood. It's a movie that is actually better than the first.<br />I must admit I was disappointed with X-men. It didn't follow the comic books to well and I thought the storyline around Wolverine was to great. I felt that X-2 didn't make that mistake and did a better job of developing characters.<br />X-2 tells the story of a mad man trying to control mutants to do his own will. Jean is starting to become Phoneix and you the Brotherhood of Mutants start to come back together. You learn more of Wolverine's past. It's a well written story.<br />The special effects in X2 are remarkable. They do an awesome job with Nightcrawler. His teleporting is remarkable. Iceman and Pyro go nuts with there respective powers and some impressive effects are shown there. The fight between Lady Deathstrike and Wolverine is cool. It's one of the best fights i've ever seen. The way they slash, hack, and stab is cool. The special effects are one of the many reasons to see the movie.<br />Overall I'd have to say X2 is best comic book moive made in a while. It follows comic book storyline well and is a must own for an X-men fan.
B000096I9G|5.0|Ok, I'm a bit biased, since I was at one of the two shows filmed for this DVD. It was amazing, one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The band were in top shape (I've seen them playing with far less perfection), and I suppose there wasn't much overdubbing to be done with the recordings. The light show was less noticable than on the DVD, where you can spice it up with good cuts and camera angles. The Pornography set was the most different compared to the LP, very powerful and sung through by the audience from beginning to end, although you don't hear much of it on the DVD. Disintegration was very similar to the original, as was Bloodflowers, which the audience did not react as enthusiastically to at first. But that was mainly due to the fact that it's the least known of the three, and afterwards many people said they didn't know how great this record was. In fact it's my favourite set on this DVD, with the often overlooked song quality coming to light with this superb performance.<br />The DVD is also remarkable for its excellent picture and sound quality. The only thing to improve I can think of would have been the inclusion of all extra tracks they played on the two nights.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I have to admit when Spiderman came out, I was excited. This is what any comic book fan had been waiting for. After seeing it, I just didn't have the enthusiam that I did when I went and saw it.<br />Spiderman tells the orign of spiderman almost to the exact that it did in the comic books. The same for the green goblin. I was impressed and loved that Sam Rami did that. A comic book movie has to stay true to its roots. If it doesn't it disrespects how it got to the big screen. Spiderman didn't do that.<br />Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman and Peter Parker. He developed the character well and was most of all believable as Spiderman. Tobey has the look that Peter Parker had in the comics. <br />Kristin Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson who is Peter Parker's childhood crush. She looks great in the movie. It's a better role for her than some of the ones she has played in the past. Her and Tobey have good chemistry together, but this is one of the places that I thought the movie got itself in some trouble. While Peter did like Mary Jane, his real love was Gwen Stacy. That's the only place were Sam Raimi messes up in this movie. Also the love scenes are to drawn out. Especially the one in the hospital.<br />William Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. He impressed me a lot in the movie. The guy has always come off to me as an intense actor. He plays an intense character and does it well. I also loved the shape the guy was in. Both him and Tobey got in amazing physical shape to play there roles.<br />Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the fight scenes. I thought most of them were to CGI. I felt they should have put more hand to hand action in there. I also didn't like the power ranger like costumes.<br />I did however like some of the special effects. Spiderman when he web slinged was impressive. Without CGI they wouldn't have been able to do a lot of that. He look as real as a Spiderman could.<br />I liked Spiderman. I do it. I just felt it was long and drawn out in places. I'd reccommend it to everybody. It's a film the whole family can sit down and watch together. It's a movie I think everybody should see. I just felt the movie was to overrated and can' see how it grossed 400 plus million at the box office. I own and I like it, I feel you will too.
B0000CEB62|2.0|The content of this DVD has been subject of heated discussions since it was pre-announced. First of all, there is of course the old 101 film by DA Pennebaker. I can't really recommend it to anyone interested in the music of DM, as it's a kind of MTV style documentary with some song clippings thrown in. The film is rather unpopular with many DM fans as well, since Pennebaker (who said that he had not known the band in the first place) choose to create a freakshow of intoxicated fan imposers and embarrassing band statements. Don't expect to watch this twice. With most of the VHS backcatalogue still unavailable on DVD, one wonders why the record company did choose this film instead of Devotional Live or Live in Hamburg.<br />The second DVD contains a lot of bonus tracks that look good on the cover but disappoint bitterly. Many fans had hoped for a complete live concert, instead we got an old TV production created from some considerably shortened songs. Mute says that the concert was not filmed in its entirety, and looking at 101 I half believe that Pennebaker messed that up as well, but I suspect they just wanted a cheap cash cow and recycled  the already released material. The only new material are interviews with some of the 'fans' from the film (I don't know how I survived without this) and the band, that is the three present members of the band, but not Alan Wilder, who gave the band the unique sound that made them superstars until he left in the 90s. (Edit: I have learned that he was asked but didn't want to participate.)<br />All in all this is for only for those who buy anything with DM written on it to complete their collection. For the rest there is still the 101 2CD with the great music to enjoy.<br />(Edit: And yes, I am a Depeche Mode fan, even though some other reviewers accuse me of spreading \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\". That's why I'm so sad that this DVD is rather neglecting and even mistreating the fine music of DM in favour of trivialities.<BR>And I don't think that this reviews are meant as Who's the biggest fan-competitions, but to give some subjective but fact-based opinions for interested customers, helping them to make their own choice. )
B0000C8AVM|5.0|In possibly the greatest album of his famed and dignified career, Dylan shines both lyrically and musically on this brilliant expression of artistic love.<BR>The Guitar and Organ sounds weaving around each other in a rising form, will have you hooked for all time.<br />Few albums can have you in it's web and hold you there till the end....<BR>This is one of those albums....<br />My personal favourite tracks are: All Of Them!<BR>There is not one track that i like more than another.<br />Once you listen to this Album once through, it will be the only thing in you're CD player(until it somehow wears out).<br />Only a person who doesen't &quot;actually&quot; listen to music would not like this album.
0810945797|5.0|I went to the San Diego comicon this year(first time ever and was suprised by the absense of trekkies.lol) and saw some older books with his designs stating that he had worked on Labyrinth and Dark Crystal which are my two fav movies... I had never known that he worked on them.<BR>While I was walking around I spotted a huge booth with prints from the movies designs and this book.<BR>I picked it up and was in awe, it is so awesome and the little add-in the back is great! He was there and I got it signed. Sooo happy!
0385512104|5.0|This is not a mistery book, it starts like one, but it turns into a beautiful novel about how an autistic mind works.  The depiction of Christopher is incredibly accurate, and I know because my son is also an Asperger kid, I felt like my son could have written many passages of the book.  It is a very original book with a very original story line, and all the characters are very real.  I read it in one seating, and I recommend it highly.  If you have never closely interacted with an Asperger kid, it will give you an worthy insight about how some interesting characters out there behave, and you will have a great time reading it; if you have close contact with autistic kids you will laugh and cry when reading how others deal with the same situations you have to face day in and day out.
0679745203|5.0|Set at the end of World War II in an Italian villa, The English Patient brings together four unlikely characters:  Hana, an emotionally-wounded army nurse who refuses to leave her last patient even when ordered to evacuate; Caravaggio, a friend of Hana's father, thief and spy, a man who is drawn to Hana in ways he cannot articulate; Kip, an Indian sapper loyal to the British military who disarms bombs by day, loves Hana by night; and the mysterious burned invalid, the English patient of the title, who unites them all in unexpected ways.  Told in poetic, often elliptical language, this novel demands to be savored instead of read voraciously.  The images are just as likely to be visually precise as they are inexplicable.  Unlike the movie, which concentrates on the love story between the English patient and the woman he loved, the novel is more about the confusing impulses that lead to both passion and danger in all the characters.<br />Serious readers of literature should read this novel more than once, for its subtleties, imagery, and the force of its lyricism.  More casual readers may find it tough reading, not because the language is inaccessible but because of the way Ondaatje backs into his story.  Those who stick with the author's poetic turns will be well-rewarded by the end.
B00005ATQD|4.0|I saw &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in the theater when it came out, and I remember thinking it was incredible. I also remember hearing lots of complaining from the other people in the theater on the way out. Basically this is a film you'll either love or hate. I think when it came out, people were disappointed because they were expecting a traditional &quot;erotic thriller&quot;, which this is not. This is a subtle, dreamlike, and very ambiguous film that explores jealousy, sexuality, death and the subconscious. I don't think most moviegoers (at least not Americans) are really comfortable with ambiguity in a film. They want clear, linear stories. But a film like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, to me, is the opposite of an insult to one's intelligence, because it leaves many of the questions of the film up to the viewer to decide for himself. It is widely known that Stanley Kubrick finished this film right before his death. After watching &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, it occured to me that this film may have been his way of communicating that even close to death, life is still made up of many more questions than answers.
B000028U0Y|4.0|Jonny cash will never be forgotten he is the original country music star. He is hard core and you always new about how he lived through his songs. This cd box set is amazing and everyone who is a Cash fan should have one.
B0000C4GQV|5.0|Machine Head are back.  Best album they've done in along time.  Hopefully with this release it'll put a stop to all the crying about them &quot;selling out&quot; and what not.  Sure TBR and SC wernt in the vein of BME but so what.  They were doin what they wanted.  In all honesty flynn doesnt &quot;rap&quot; as much as people make it out to seem.  But hands down TTAOE is right up there with BME.  Soon as your finished with the first track Imperium you'll see what i mean.  4 mins or so into the track they kick into what rob calls his &quot;judas priest&quot; riff.  Type of riffing you've never heard from MH.  They pull off alot of changes and new ideas with this album.  The walls of guitars are back, ohh are they back.  And the song Decend The Shades Of Night is, in my eyes, one of the best songs they've ever done.  The acustic guitars in it are really good, not to mention a change up from what MH normally do, since they've never used acustic guitars before.  Over all the album is every emotion you can feel and roll it all together and thats what you got.  Hardcore MH fans will without a doubt be pleased with this album
B00004U2GH|4.0|Jonny cash is the originator of country music. I fyou don't like this cd then you don't like jonny. His songs are from his heart and you can feel what he feels just by listening to his music. He is not only a song writter but a story teller as well.
B00005A46T|2.0|go listen to slayer or MH before you bother with slipknot.  Slipknot is probably the most overrated band of all time.  Yes they got some catchy songs here and there, ie People = s***, sic and eyeore.  But other then that their crap.  The whole mask/boiler suits stuff was a clear rip off of mushroomhead (who've been around alot longer then slipknot has) and the excess members is just plan retarted.  They hardly use their dj or keyboardist and the 2 idiots that bang on beer kegs are just pointless.  If they got rid of them and just had singer, bassist, 2 guitarist (mick is a fine guitar player) and a drummer (joey, who in the right style could tear s*** up) they'd be a force to reckon with.  But that wont happen, so in the meantime go do yourself a favor, go back to what made thrash, slayer
B0000B1OFL|5.0|THE ITALIAN JOB  has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years.  Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE ITALIAN JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible.  The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best.  The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push.  Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a comraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton.  With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit.  For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre.
B000002HMH|2.0|james voice is horrible.  It's been high pitched and squeeky since the black album tour, dont believe me just check out the live s*** box set and listen.  He tries to hard to &quot;sing&quot; and in turn ends up signing off key and what not.  The cd has 2 maybe 3 songs on it that are worth listening to.  Bleeding Me is one of the best songs they've wrote, hands down.  I love it.  But some of the other material they put on this cd is pure utter crap
B00006SFLV|5.0|I remember that the only thing in 1994 was how important it was to watch MY SO CALLED LIFE with my mother... it was the only thing that brought us together and when it was over the time me and my mother spent together also started to be over... When it went off the air I could never find a more enjoyable show that could even relate to MSCL... so when I found out that they were putting it in dvd I went absolutely crazy... so when I finally bought it and rewatched every episode I became actually happy and it had been awhile since I felt this way so it was like finding a piece of my heart... The way I related to Angela and some of the other characters was unreal... I mean it was almost as Winnie Holzman had taken pages from my life and created this extraordinary wonderful show... I was so sad to see it go but I guess moving on is apart of life but really unable to do after rewatching every show... and I still do almost every weekend... This show is so relatable and so real and is just an all around beautiful show that is a much watch!!! From the creators to the writers to the cast... It is really a wonderful must have show!!!
B000002KZT|5.0|what can i say, hands down best thrash metal cd of all time... period.<br />oh, and its in alter of sacrifice when he says enter to the relm of satan buddy... learn the song titles before you go reviewing the cd.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is a unique and beautiful film in that it tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman without marring the truth with pretense or bravado. The film, as a whole, presents a vision of world war 2 Poland that was painstakingly crafted as to give the viewer an idea of the chaos, cruelty, and reality that was the backdrop for the life of the protagonist. The plot is essentialy about the survival of Szpilman as Nazi Germany invaded his homeland, sending his family to concentration and labor camps to die.The cinematography is an achievement in itself and the film is historically accurate, in one scene even showing a Nazi cameraman filming the proceedings as the Nazis truly kept thorough records.  This film does not hide the ungodly practices that were Nazi doctrine, and throughout the film, we see the arbitrary brutality that was the fate of so many polish citizens. A young woman is shot in the forehead when she asks what soldiers intend to do with their prisoners and a young boy is beaten to death trying to escape a prison wall, a scene that diector polanski lived through when he escaped nazi occupied Poland through a wall. However, because Wladyslaw Szpilman is a great artist , and more importantly, because he is very lucky, he manages to escape this ill-fates of his family members. It is through this journey that we become aquainted with the other characters in the film. These characters form the incredible depth of the film. The Polish people as a whole are not made out to be saintly patriots,one dimensional sufferers, or the subhuman manifestaion of Nazi theories.They are more accurately sculpted as human beings with weaknesses and strengths, and their own dark sides. Wladyslaw Szpilman's family represents a side of Poland that was intellegent and artistic, with strong and cohesive families, the embodiment of what so many of us strive for. For them, we feel sympathy. Their loss is truly tragic, because their fall is so great. They are not without their imperfections though, and this is  shown succinctly when Wladyslaw's brother lets his sister know that he ,\\" Wished I could have known you better...\\" before being sent to a camp. Also depicted, are characters who would steal a guandis and dying musician's money for survial, a below average intellegence propaghandist newspaper distibutor and prisoners who fight old women for food. On the other hand, we are not introduced to many Germans on an intimate level. The soldiers who are represented are usually brutal and murderous, fufilling the grand design of the Nazi plan. From soldiers, this behavior was solicited and required, but we also encounter a nasty german woman who would have the protagonist shot for being Jewish. This seems to suggest an evil nature of the society as a whole... until Wladyslaw meets a german officer who saves his life. The scene of their meeting is particularily striking and beautiful. Up until this point we have really only seen Wladyslaw Szpilman reacting to the chaos around him. Here he is confronted by the officer with the question of \\"who are you\\". Wladyslaw explains that he is a Pianist, but then stutters and stops...\\" I was a Pianist\\". And this is the state to which he has been reduced. He is no longer an artist. He is no longer human, nand does not look more alive than dead. He has been stripped of his humanity completely, and thus of his identity as THE PIANIST. But instead of killing him, the soldier asks him to play, and so is the character revealed to us. He is revelaed by his music, and while he plays, the officer listens, overwhelmed by the identity that Wladyslaw has recovered.
B000002H97|2.0|If cliff was alive when tallica wrote black album he'd probably laugh in their face.  The album as a whole blows.  A select songs on it are good, ie my friend of misery, unforgivin, through the never and struggle within.  Enter Sandman is the most overrated piece of crap song i think i've ever heard (prior to hearing st anger) Load and Reload were worse, and words cant even express how bad st anger was.  This was the album that started the mighty Metallicas downfall.  You cant go from Master Of Puppets, Disposible Heros, Dyers Eve and such to Enter Sandman, or Mama Said... sad what once was the forrunner of thrash metal has come to.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Finally, a cd I don't mind spending my hard earned money on! I can't stop listening to this disc. I have been so bored with all of the &quot;wanna be / sound like that band&quot; crap that I kind of gave up on the music biz. Mars Volta really doesn't bring anything new to the music arena. They've done a great job reinventing prog-rock. They've taken Yes' &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; album and added a harder edge, some latin rhythm flavoring, and a live feel I have not heard on any recording in a while. When I listen to this record, I get the feeling that I'm at their live show. I can't wait to see them tonight (they will be in town tonight). At The Drive In was good. Mars Volta, to me, is better. With the addition of Red Hot Chili Pepper's Flea on bass, this collection of songs is something not to be missed. Flea is excellent on this one. If you're a drummer, like me, you owe it to yourself to check the drummer out. BUY THIS CD!!!!!!
B000002L68|5.0|This classic LP was the first to fully incorporate new Guitarist Wendy Melvoin and in my opinion, this is the classic Revolution lineup. While Prince had hinted at rock on his previous work, &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; charges right in (after the timeless 'dearly beloved...' spoken intro)with heavy, distorted riffs, solid drumming and a splash of heavy synth funk that still thrillsa nd gets you pumping 20 years later. His caterwauling, strangulated solo climaxes the song on a perfect note and you can actually hear feedback, tape hiss and David Z's drums bashing out the last few notes of the tune before it's succinct conclusion. Recorded live in a warehouse in Minneapolis in the summer of 83, this track starts off what is still Prince's best known and best selling work. Standing alone without the film, this music quite powerful, melodic (&quot;Take Me with U&quot;) passionate (&quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;) and joyous (&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, &quot;Baby I'm A Star&quot;). This will never sound old. Even by today's standards, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is hard to top.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I honestly thought that Enigma was over after LSD: Love, Sensuality, Devotion, the incorrectly compiled greatest hits album, despite the fact that Cretus under a contract with Virgin to release new material every so often. This unexpected 5th studio album, Voyageur, is a nice to surprise, mainly because the first single of the same name is a catchy instrumental with incredibly groovy beats, despite a ridiculous lesb[ian]-erotic video that represents Enigmas own Gravity of Love video with choreography taken from Kylie Minogues Cant Get You Out Of My Head video. Although Gregorian chants are absent here, most of the album remains a disaster of Cretus cliches much like 2000s The Screen Behind The Mirror. It seems that if you play this record backwards you may just get one of Enigmas previous albums. Olives Ruth-Anns vocals dont work as well as they did on Gravity Of Love and Silence Must Be Heard, she sounds monotonous, again, much like the rest of the record. Most interesting moment comes with The Look Of Today, a techno number that samples an 80s ABC hit The Look Of Love. On the contrary, unlike other Enigma albums, which focused on songs and melodies, best of this album only consists of rhythms and their pleasant arrangements, like The Piano, the titles of which speaks of itself  no stupid words of wisdom, just piano bars. If there is going to be yet another Enigma release after this, it should have no lyrics and no vocals, Cretu obviously ran out of ideas and vocalists to choose from. C+
0385335482|5.0|This book was so just hilarious and Sophia Kinsella just understands us girls and our shopping problems. So the main character Rebecca Bloomwood is a major shopaholic and the irony of it all is that she is a financial journalist. She has bills that she always pretends not to see makes up the strangest excuses not to call the bank for a meeting. But she tries to cut back but that doesn't work and makes her feel bad. What does she do then? Go shopping. When she tries to make more money and that doesn't work, what does she do? Go shopping. Some of the things that she tries to pay off her debts are just too great. <BR>Even though she seems rather superficial and shallow at times judging people by what brand of clothes people wear, but she does have a heart. Somewhere in the book she had a great chance to pay off most of her debt but she didn't do it. So deep down inside she is a good person who just can't help her little habit like every other girl I know. <BR>When I got this book I couldn't put it down. So if you're looking for a good book that's funny and interesting, get this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|From the first time I heard &quot;Bring me to Lie&quot; I was hooked and wanted to know more. It was a mixture of music that I love but have never heard together. Amy Lee's voice is amazing and the vocal range is unbelievable. She makes the hard rock and orchestra blend together perfectly with her voice. This was one of the few Cd's that I own that I listen to every single song. My favorite is &quot;Hello&quot; it is such a great song and you feel what Amy is all about by the way she sings it. Thanks to Evanescence they have opened up a new way for rock to go and introduced me to 12Stones due to their collaboration on &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;.
B000069AUI|1.0|Annoying, annoying, annoying. Coldplay tries to make sophisticated music but it doesn't work! The lyrics, vocals and music are enough to put you to sleep, which I guess, if that is your sole purpose, to sleep, I would give this a 5 star rating. LAME GROUP AND CD. Oh, and Parachutes isn't any better. Do yourself a favor, save your money & buy something from an artist with TALENT.
068485743X|5.0|Noah Lukeman's book on staying out of the rejection pile is different from most in that it's written by an agent and not a teacher.  That makes a huge difference.  Lukeman is telling us what he sees on a daily basis and how to elevate your work from the bottom of the slush pile.  <br />The book does a great job of explaining the problems most manuscripts contain, then tells you how to fix them, THEN offers exercises to help you overcome the problem.  After working through just one exercise, I felt like my writing took a major leap forward.  I think the book will do the same for all serious writers willing to devote a little time to this valuable book.<br />206 pages
B000002H33|5.0|This is without a doubt metallica's best work to date.I dont believe they will ever make an album that comes close to this one.The whole album is heavy,fast and melodic in some parts.All the songs are killer and my favorite is master of puppets.Metallica had success with this album while not losing their integrity,but thats not the case now adays.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0000AUHOH|2.0|\\"Star Trek: The Final Frontier\\" was a blow from which the Star Trek franchise never quite recovered.  Released after the enormously successful \\"Voyage Home\\", this was a perfect opportunity for the Trek franchise to vault itself to immortality (like James Bond- he'll just never die).  Instead, entry #5 got the worst reviews of all Trek films, both before and after.  Audiences were furious at how bad it was, and after a modest opening weekend it fell like a stone at the box office.  That was that- after \\"The Final Frontier\\", there were more hit Trek films, but the franchise never again recaptured its box office glory of the mid-80's, and finally died whimpering with \\"Nemesis\\" in 2002.<br />So just what is wrong with \\"The Final Frontier\\"?  Namely, the film tries to combine the action of \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" with the comedy of \\"The Voyage Home\\", but somehow only pulls the worst parts from both of those films.  The action is boring, and the humor is dangerously misplaced.  The Trek regulars are sleepwalking through their roles, with only Deforest Kelley showing some energy as McCoy.  The \\"guest actors\\"- such as David Warner and Laurence Luckinbill- are given nothing to do.  The special effects were terrible, probably the low point of the series.  Finally, the entire \\"search for God\\" storyline is presented in the most boring and mundane fashion imaginable.  The only time the film manages to generate a little tension is during its ending, and even then it manages to blow it with a very confusing climax.<br />So what went wrong?  Many \\"Final Frontier\\" defenders blame the budget.  It is true that Paramount repeatedly cut the budget for this film, but that can't be the entire problem.  \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" was the best Trek film and yet it had the lowest budget, even when adjusted for inflation.  \\"Batman\\", which came out the same summer as \\"Final Frontier\\", had a roughly equal budget but was a much better looking film.<br />The blame then must be put on the screenwriters and director.  Just how much of it was Shatner's fault I'm not really sure of, but considering that he directed and co-wrote the film and that it focuses on the heroics of Kirk at the expense of the other characters, I must say that I partially blame him for it.  I will rent this DVD to check out the special features, but I will never buy it.  Not even Gene Roddenberry liked this film- that should tell you something.  It has its moments, but it does not belong in the Star Trek franchise.
B0000DF3PN|4.0|Cet album est chant vraiment bien. Jean-Jacques et les autres \\"types\\" ont bien fait! Les chansons sont pas forte en vocales, mais les paroles sont trs trs mouvantes. Surtout \\"Rien n'est vraiment fini\\". \\"Je Lui Dirai\\", c'est le fun. Son premier 45 \\"Tout L'Or Des Hommes\\" place le feeling pour le reste de l'album. C'est super, a! Achte l'album! a vaut l'argent!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Honestly, this is possibly my favorite Madonna album. I don't see why other people do not like it, I really do. The songs are written very well, and the music is excellent. The first three tracks are a bit of a trilogy, as she thinks about what she has accomplished, and how her priorities are so much different now. She is clearly no longer a &quot;material girl.&quot; As the first three tracks clear away the dust and cobwebs, she begins to dig deeper into the things that really DO matter. My favorite tracks are Intervention and Nothing Fails. I like the style of this album, a lot different from what she has done before. For those of you that do not like this album very much, perhaps you were expecting something more like her older music? Or maybe you just don't like the sound of this one. Her vocals just keep getting better. My advice: this is one of those albums that you either love or hate, so I suggest you borrow a copy before you buy. I was very satisfied with this album, and hope Madonna keeps making music for a long time to come.
B000002N2Z|5.0|Any one who likes bands like Korn or OLD Staind will love this CD. It is one of the 5 best in heavymetal/alternative CD's.<BR>That's all.
B000069AUI|4.0|Don't get me wrong, buy this album if you already haven't, it's better than most of what is out today in music, but when I first heard these guys back a few years ago when they first came out, I just couldn't get over the similarity they had to Jeff Buckley, which is something nobody mentions anymore because Coldplay has become so popular. I was almost angry that even though the lead singer admits that he (Jeff) was one of his biggest influences, they are still considered an \\"original\\" band. Although throughout time I have really grown to appriciate thier music and almost forget that they did rip off Jeff Buckley a fair bit, and now that Jeff has nothing more to offer us as he died an early death it's nice to hear something similar to him. But buy Jeff's album \\"Grace\\" if you like these guys. It's not easy listening, but worth every penny.

B000088E6P|1.0|Now, when I heard In Da Club on the radio, I thought that 50 Cent was actually gonna be good, unlike most rap these days. But, when I got this album, it was whack. I'll be honest, it has some tight beats and good lyrics, but for some reason this album is just boring. Even In Da Club got because the radio overplayed it. I'll rate the songs:<br />\\"What up Gangsta\\"- Okay, nice beat but it's just too boring! 3/5<br />\\"Patiently Waiting\\"- Eminem is okay, but 50 Cent just can't get my attention on this track. 3/5<br />\\"Many Men\\"- Tight chorus that really saves a boring song. 4/5<br />\\"In Da Club\\"- just way too overplayed, or it would be nice. 3/5<br />\\"High All The Time\\"-Nope, nice beat but otherwise it sucks. 1/5<br />\\"If I Can't\\"- Nice beat, but he's not being very truthful is he? 1/5<br />\\"Blood Hound\\"- Nice beat but boring. 1/5<br />\\"Back Down\\"- See above. 1/5<br />\\"P.I.M.P.\\"- very boring. He just can't flow. 1/5<br />\\"Like My Style\\"- I definately hate his style. 1/5<br />\\"Poor Lil Rich\\"- nope, no way. 1/5<br />\\"21 Questions\\"- Finally! A tight song by 50 Cent! Go Nate Dogg! 5/5<br />\\"Don't Push Me\\"- No flow, if there is one it would make it worse 1/5<br />\\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\\"- better than others, but not the best. 3/5<br />\\"Wanksta\\"- boring, boring, boring... 2/5<br />\\"U Not Like Me\\"- I ain't seen nobody that sucks as much as him, so yeah, nobody's like him. 1/5<br />\\"Life's On The Line\\"- Okay i guess, but not the best. 2/5<br />Overall, if you like an album with beats, this is for you. It's okay lyrically, too, but this just makes for a boring album. Beats and lyrics mean nothing if it's boring. I recommend Obie Trice over 50 Cent any day.
B000089RVR|5.0|Usually I like to hear songs from a CD before I buy it, but I was so impressed with Dido's first, that I decided to take an immediate chance on her second.  I bought it the day after it came out and was I glad I took that chance!  This album is wonderful, beautiful - the lyrics (and rhythms) just reach into your soul.  My favs are, well just about all of them, but particularly: White Flag, Stoned, Life for Rent, See You When You're 40, and See the Sun.  I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music that identifies personally with them.  Dido is on a roll and I see my collection of her music continuing to grow in the future.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I bought this a couple of months ago and it was worth every dime that i spent. I don't have to skip a single song on here, not even the intro! The intro is actually pretty cool, nice 13 second beat. Session was pretty cool too for an instrumental, even though it sounds a little weird.<br />&quot;Don't Stay&quot;- Nice way to start off the CD. I like the way Chester screams in the verses. 4/5<br />&quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;-Why do you think i bought the CD? 5/5<br />&quot;Lying from You&quot;-Nice chorus, it gets stuck in my head. 4/5<br />&quot;Hit the Floor&quot;-Um, it was alright, the rapping was cool but the chorus could've sounded better. 2/5<br />&quot;Easier to Run&quot;-This song is sweet,nice bridge, this chorus gets stuck in my head also. 5/5<br />&quot;Faint&quot;-Same as Somewhere I Belong. 5/5<br />&quot;Figure 09&quot;-Nice beat, nice verses. 4/9<br />&quot;Breaking the Habbit&quot;-Nice beat, verses, and the chorus rocks. 5/5<br />&quot;From the Inside&quot;-Same as Breaking The Habbit. 5/5<br />&quot;Nobody's listening&quot;-this is my favorite. The rap is sweet and i like the way they did the chorus. 5/5<br />&quot;Numb&quot;-My second favorite. it's a nice way to end the CD. 5/5<br />If you haven't bought this CD yet, and you liked Hybrid Theory, you need to buy it right now.
B00006690G|5.0|This is a great CD, eminem raps about politics and he even sings in one of the songs, and it turned out to be good, here are some of my song rating and they are fair and they only express my opinion and how good the song is.<br />White america 8/10: this is a great intro for an album, he shows his anger and his opinion in this politically sent massege song.<br />buisness 8/10: it's great, with some impressive lyrics, and the beat is good and fast paced.<br />cleaning out my closet 9/10: a wonderfull song, it shows his anger toward his mom, but there is something i dont understand, in the verses he disses his mom and insults her, but in the chorus he tells her that he is sorry, i dont get it.<br />Square dance 9/10 one of the best songs on the album, it shows that Eminem isn't like other rapper who rap about money and girsl, there is some politics involved in this song though.<br />Soldier 8/10: the best thing about this song is the lyrics, they are really good, but the beat is kind of weak.<br />say goodbye hollywood 8/10: a nice hook and a somewhat great lyrics but it's great, the hook of the song will suck you into the song.<br />drips 7/10: This song reminds of other rappers who rap about money and girls, and the lyrics are kind of nasty, but it still kind of good, i guess.<br />without me 8/10: this song is kind of dedicated to kids who want to laugh at some funny lyrics.<br />sing for the moment 10/10: what makes this song good? the chorus is top notch, and the verses and lyrically detailed, one of the best songs on the album.<br />superman 8/10: i dont really like this song alot, but it still good though.<br />hail's song 9/10: eminme really can't sing but he at least tried in this song, but some people won't like the transition between singing and rap in the 3rd verse<br />when the music stops 8/10: this song has no HOOk, it's more kind of freestyle, but it still good with a great beat.<br />say what you say 9/10: what really grabs me into this song are the HOOk its really great,Dre and eminem rap great in this lyrically attractive song.<br />till i collapse 9/10: a hard song with a loud beat and with a great chorus bye nate dawg,lol whatever his name is.<br />my dad's gone crazy: 8/10 : this song is kinda suited for listning for some kids but it has too much swearing in it, so i dont know.<br />OVERALL 9/10 is the best rating of this album, your music colection will still be INCOMPLETE without having this album, even if you dont like rap.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|Metropolis is a film which is famous for its images: the titanic city, the freaky robot, the columns of workers marching to their machines. It's no wonder, really--the picture cost a whopping 5.3 million marks, was produced by one of the most technically innovative film studios in the world (Germany's Ufa), and was filmed by one of the most influential directors in all of film history, namely Fritz Lang.<br />So Metropolis is a great film, right? Well, almost. Despite its action and eye-popping visuals, Metropolis is still a political fable which is so naive, so patronizing and shallow, that anyone attempting to take the plot seriously is either going to become apathetic or irritated. Moreover, the cutting of the film from 4,189 meters to 3,421--only those who were present for the first run in Berlin saw the entire film--has hobbled Lang's ordinarily impeccable storytelling.<br />Nevertheless, the film is a must-see for film students, and it can now even be recommended to the interested casual viewer. The reconstruction in Kino's edition resuscitates a story which was often downright confusing in its previous incarnations, and finally you can actually see what is going on. Anyone who has suffered through one of the many inferior versions of the movie will be ecstatic, and if you haven't seen Metropolis before, forget what you think you know about silent films!<br />Overall the Kino on Video edition is very well done, with a clean picture (taking into consideration that these images were made 77 years ago) and a great documentary; this should become the definitive edition. The only criticism is that the commentary--or at least the portion that I had the patience to sit through--is utterly devoid of content. Apparently all the good material was used in the documentary, and so the commentary limits itself to being observations about of what is happening on the screen.<br />The only other thing to mention here is that one reviewer complained that the film was not shownat the correct speed because it occasionally appeared as if it were still speeded up. He then went on to say that he happened to know that certain scenes were actually undercranked for emphasis, apparently thinking that this meant that they would go slower than normal in the finished film. Just the opposite: when film was undercranked (fewer film exposures per second) things appear to go FASTER than normal when screened. So the bits where a character seems to run at inhuman speed across the screen were done on purpose. No need to blame the restorers there.<br />Fans of Metropolis who want to see Fritz Lang at his best should check out M and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler.
B00000JNNY|5.0|This is what people who truly appreciate good music refer to as &#34;R&B&#34;. On this classic set of tunes sung with the kind of power and conviction that many of today's young singers tend to shy away from (or just can't deliver, lol), you get the RHYTHM and the BLUES in one devastating combination. Etta James is one of this country's unheralded treasures and everytime I listen to this album, I am reminded of how much we need true artists like her to keep good music from going bad. No serious music collection should be without this one because it IS essential.  Note: also get Bobby &#34;Blue&#34; Bland's 'Two Steps From The Blues' and play it back-to-back with Etta James' 'At Last' for an R&B listening experience like NO OTHER! By the way, are these two in the Hall of Fame, yet!?!?!?
B000089CKH|4.0|This is an excellent album.  Great lyrics-very introspective at times.  It goes from straight up indie pop to a more melancholy, maudlin pop.  If you are into Death Cab for Cutie, check this out!
B000005IU2|5.0|This is everything you need to know about rock music, boiled down to seven songs.  It had ear-splitting force, gritty funk blues and wild sonic abandon.  Mostly, its just the sort of god awful racket that you need to shake the cobwebs off of your crusty, dirty soul.
0385508417|2.0|This is far below his best work.  Gisham is in his element writing about lawyers.  A Painted House, while given great reviews, wasn't nearly as good as his gripping legal suspense novels.  I must say that Skipping Christmas should be skipped.  It might have been all right as a short story, but as a novel, I kept wondering when it would get interesting.  It never did.  Buy any other Grisham book, but don't buy this one.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|We watched this movie in cinema and i loved it right off the bat.  The soundtrack is marvelous and almost makes the movie.  A definite classic of all time.
0743243307|4.0|Nanzeen is a Bangladeshi woman who marries young, sent to Britain to a husband chosen by her father. This book follows her journey, from naive village girl to mother of two living in modern London.<br />This book has been highly feted since before its publication (the author made it onto the Granta authors under 40 list based on an unpublished manuscript). As usually happens, this book doesn't quite live up to expectations. It has its faults - Ali uses the device of letters written by Nanzeen's sister to forward the plot, and while in short doses it is interesting, she over-uses it and a whole chapter of these letters is too much, especially as they are written in childish, broken English. And the pivotal affair between Nanzeen and a young Islamic activist is not very credible.<br />But there is more good about this book than bad - every character feels well rounded, and their motivations seem plausible without being overly obvious. This is a book that touches on a lot of political points (Islam, women's rights, culture clash etc) but avoids the soapbox and none feels shoehorned in. Most importantly, this is an interesting story well written that carries you along to the very end. While the setting and plot on first inspection could be considered mundane - a woman living in a council flat who does little else but cook, clean and care for her husband &amp; children - is developed into an interesting story by great characterisation and a vibrant spin on universal themes. This is a longish book - over 400 pages - but it doesn't read as such. Taken on its own merits, rather than as the great 'Bangla' hope, this is a worthwhile book.
B00005O5CM|4.0|A Film by Robert Luketic<br />I wasn't very interested in Legally Blonde at first, but with all of the positive reviews and having a couple of friends who told me that I should give it a chance, I finally had the chance to rent the movie.  On one hand, it was exactly what I expected.  On the other hand, it was a pretty good movie.<br />Reese Witherspoon is Elle Woods, a senior in college who lives a life of privilege.  She is the pampered girl who was homecoming queen and was involved in all of the stereotypical activities.  She is the social queen, but nobody expects much out of her intellectually (though she pierces that bubble when talking about the fashion and the minutia regarding the industry).  She expects her boyfriend to propose to her, but instead he dumps her saying that he needs someone serious in his life if he expects to be in the Senate by age 30.  She is crushed and decides to follow him to law school and enroll herself (and show that she is a serious person).  She is actually accepted to Harvard Law School on the strength of her test scores and Harvard's desire to diversify a little (she really did qualify, though).<br />At first, Elle is treated like a joke but her determination wins through and she gains friends and respect.  In a way, that's what this movie is.  I thought it was going to be a joke and completely fluffy, but Reese (and the movie) tries so hard and is so likeable that I couldn't help but enjoy the movie.  I don't think that I would buy Legally Blonde, but it was an enjoyable movie to watch.  Everything turns out as you would expect it too (so don't expect to be surprised at anything), but Legally Blonde rises above that and is actually a pretty good movie.
B00007E8V4|5.0|My Favorite Tracks on this album are as follows:<BR>3-bubbles<BR>5-nu_guns<BR>7-Mr. Jack<BR>11-Highway song<BR>13-Ego Brain<BR>14-thetawaves<BR>Now don't get me wrong here i like all the tracks on the album but the songs i never mentioned are songs that probably would be made into singles and would become overplayed.  Even Daron admits the song he hates most is Chop Suey because it is so overplayed.  Still SOAD rocks and they need to come out with a new album, not songs that they recorded earlier (most of the songs on &quot;Steal This Album&quot; are songs they recorded during Toxcicity that never made it to the final cut because they didn't feel the songs went along with the feel or theme of the cd), but actual new material.  SOAD ROCKS!
0767817729|3.0|Revenge is exactly what it's title implies, and like the act the film is named after, it certainly isn't pretty.  Kevin Costner plays a US Navy pilot who is the friend of an extremely wealthy Mexican millionaire (Anthony Quinn).  While staying at Quinn's, Costner ends up having an affair with Quinn's wife (Madeline Stowe) and soon (naturally) Quinn finds out and seeks retribution by having Costner beaten and left for dead, and Stowe tortured and made into a junkie prostitute.  Sounds like a movie for the whole family eh?  Director Tony Scott (The Hunger, Top Gun) shows us all the gritty detail that he is known for, and like I said earlier, Revenge is not a pretty film.  It is very violent (almost over the top like Scott's next film True Romance) and sometimes hard to watch, but besides all that Revenge is a fairly solid action film with a standout performance from the late Anthony Quinn.  All in all, action fans or fans of Kevin Costner (hello? anybody?) should give this a look.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|First off, let's get this out of the way: The Matrix Reloaded is only half of one HUGE movie. Keep that in mind when you watch it, because it doesn't end...it just stops. As for people saying that the story is pure gibberish, you might want to watch this movie a few more times...it is truly an incredible script (of the first half of a movie). It makes many many multiple connections with itself and the first movie, that ultimately weave an intricate web of storytelling. As for the effects, go back and watch \\"The Matrix\\" and then try to tell me that it's effects are better than Reloaded's....
0553583182|5.0|First of all, don't dismiss my words just because of my style of writing.  I'm real intell but prefer to write casual, not from some high horse.  Also this is how I feel like writing so I will do that.  We are in a casual forum not in some classroom.  Mostly people judge because they are envious.  So if you judge/put down my writing style I will think you're jealious.  If you don't want me to think that then jus shuddup and open your mind.  I'm writing this review after around 8 years of reading this kinda stuff.  And let me tell you THIS is the book.  All the concepts attempted by other books ALWAYS BOIL DOWN to *this* book right here.  I've read books in the past 8-9 years about this material and are reading more.  But after reading *this*, all books seem boring, rhetorical and all past books are now clear.  but when I re-read them they also seem rhetorical.  Boring.  It is as if I am at a whole new 'n higher level.  It is a life changer and it will lift you to a higher level of knowledge.  Now, my godam review:<br />Who knows why more don't know about this book.  Who knows ESPECIALLY WHY government workers/representors don't make this required reading.<br />We all instinctively know this stuff.  However, we are brainwashed to limit it.  SNAP OUT OF IT.  Get this book.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.  It's for your own good.  I'm only writing this stuff b/c I care about you as a human being, and about the human race and crud.  I make nothing from you reading or buying this TREASURE.  If I was homeless and was given ONE thing, I'd rather it be THIS BOOK than anything else.  Because no one can take away your knowledge, and your INBORN RIGHT to use your other-half of your brain (the left side, I think).  Not only that but the act OF USING THIS OTHER SIDE will be able to get me out of homeless ness effortlessly and get me anything I want.  GET IT?  JUST get it
B00005JLTN|5.0|Ok, i have read some of your peoples reviews about how awful this movie was. Just because you had a problem with the directors plot or the sex scene or god knows what....just get off the crack and watch the movie. The fact remains that the point of this movie was to let people see some awsome fight scenes and some amazing special effects. If that was what you were looking for.....you got it! This movies fight scenes rocked. After seeing this movies in theaters i wanted to go home where something black, grab a fake gun, and start jumping on my bed pretending to dodge bullets. Its entertainment folks not film school. Enjoy the movie throw away your popcorn and soda and leave the...theater.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I usually HATE pop music and I'm not sure why. I guess it's just too bubbly. But this cd for some reason really attracted me! Dido's beautiful voice is put to good strength and all the songs are really catchy. ^^<br />1.Here With Me - Here with me is sorta techno and slow. I love it. After the very first verse, a great beat comes in and makes you wanna sing along with her. - 9.5/10<br />2.Hunter - This song has a really cool acoustic guitar at the beginning, but soon become poppy too. I really LOVE these lyrics, too! 'i want to be a hunter again, i want to see the world all over again, to take a chance on life again, so let me go...' - 9.4/10<br />3.Don't Think Of Me - i promise, i've never heard a song like this in my life. Really unique beat, lyrics, and insturments. Dont think of me was probably the very first song I became obcessed with on the cd. ^^ 'so you're with her, and not with me.' - 9/10<br />4.My Lover's Gone - a song without much of a beat, but one of the most beautiful ever. This is probably the slowest song on the cd, and it's REALLY sad! -sniffle- After a while through the song acoustic guitar comes in-YA! - 9.5/10<br />5.All You Want - this song i could never get into very well. i mean, dont get me wrong, it's an awesome song, but it just gets a little boring after you listen to it a few times. - 8.5/10<br />6.Thank You - i LOVE this song. :) really perty guitar, voice, lyrics, sound, everything. i enjoy listening to it and singing along. i can relate alot to it, also. - 9.4/10<br />7.Honestly OK - wow. this song is...weird. Extremely depressing. I enjoy it though...does that say something bad about me? ha. but anyhoo, this song is very slow and lacks much of any music. really good &quot;i'm soooo depressed&quot; song! - 8.9/10<br />8.Slide - i like this song alot too! awesome tune that ANYONE would have to listen to and love. the chorus is really cool, too: 'it's alright to make mistakes, you're only human.' - 9/10<br />9.Isobel - my second song to become obcessed with. the music is kinda like an indian tribe kinda thing. it's really awesome! i guarantee you'd love this song! - 9.7/10<br />10.I'm No Angel - MY CURRENT OBCESSION. I looove this song to death! some of the most awesome acoustic guitar ever. great beat, bad girl-ish lyrics, and a BEAUTIFUL VOICE! - 10/10<br />11.My Life - my life is probably the only song i dislike on this cd. -.- it's kinda...annoying. but, my close friend really loves it, so maybe it's just me? not sure what to even say about it... - 7.9/10<br />12.Take my Hand (bonus track) - this song starts out with her singing on her own and slowly gains music...it's pretty cool! :) the lyrics are really cute, too! a sweet, romantic song... - 9.8/10<br />There you have it. Dido has one of the most beautiful and unique voices i've ever heard in my life. And her songs may be pop, but i promise you you'll love these songs, and this cd! It's completely worth the money and enjoyable. ...i gotta go buy her new one!! ^_~

B000001YOW|5.0|Wanted to buy this album but I took Metanoia album by mistake at the music store.  Metanoia is great but wasn't what I was expecting.  Too much the same from start to end and I was just getting tired of it after a couple of songs.<br />When I finally found Signify, I couldn't care less about the $60 injected (the 2 albums together) to find such wonder.  Ironically, the songs I love the most, are similar to Metanoia's style.<br />&quot;Waiting phase two&quot; is my favorite, nice tom tom beat at the begining, after a minute he adds the bass and some piano notes here and there.  At the third minute, tom tom is softly subsituted by a drum (transition is so well done) and then the addition of the etheral guitar.  <br />Second favorite is &quot;Intermediate Jesus&quot; with a nice and strange gurgling bass that fit well with the drum and all other ambient sounds.<br />&quot;Sleep of no dreaming&quot; is a beautiful song.  &quot;Signify&quot; is quite energic and original, more in &quot;In absentia&quot; album way.  &quot;Waiting phase one&quot; is more accoustic.<br />This album is now top 1 on my chart
B00006LLNU|5.0|After hearing a pair of songs off this album, I sat in a dark room to listen to the whole album. There are not many albums that can literally paint a canvass on the mind as ( ). On most of the songs there is an latent emotionalism that breaks out on the albums final two songs. Epic in nature but sparing in instrumentation, Sigur Ros has created artistry in sound!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is 9 years old and it's still the masterpiece today that it was in '97. Those other, more shallow movies like the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, The Matrix Trilogy, and the latest Star Wars films have actually taken most of Titanic's glory. They've drowned Titanic out of popular culture. It's more fun to attack the film than to actually watch the film. It is extremely sad because this remarkable has never lost its profound impact. It's an unforgettable, timeless legend of a film.    Luke
031286504X|5.0|The only complaint I have of this book is that it was too short. Otherwise it has swiftly become among one of the best vampire stories I have ever had the fortune to read. Far from being a typical vampire tale, Matheson takes the vampire out of its Victorian era setting and Gothic castles and into the streets of your mundane suburbanite life; wandering aimlessly and mindlessly through shopping marts and supermarkets seeking for living blood to sustain them, these vampires have more in common with George Romero's zombies than to Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br />Incredibly, superstition plays no part in Matheson's dark tale of these ambling mindless children of the night, as the story's struggling hero experiments scientifically on the zombiefied vampires, discovering that the ultimate cause of vampirism was a parasitic germ. Matheson satisfyingly tosses out the long held and cliched use in literature of religious artifacts to repell vampires and instead explains his vampires' revulsion toward them to be psychological rather than by any innate divine power that they might contain. Philosophically, this book could be looked at as a thinly concealed venture into existentialism.<br />In any case, I advise anyone who enjoyed Romero's zombie films and Stephen King's The Stand to pick up this book, I almost guarantee you will not regret the choosing of it.

B00005JM93|5.0|\\"The vengeance is irreversible, as the wound... as each act, as everything\\" - Gaspar No<BR>This is not a film for everybody, that's something you should take into account first. It demands a complete surrender from the spectator to understand the \\"gratuitous violence\\" that some want to point. This movie only has two violent moments, very disturbing, I admit it, but completely necessary... you'll live through the characters (thanks to a very intelligent filming technique) their love, their motives, their pain, fear, rage... <BR>It's nightmare from where you can't go back, each act you commit is irreversible... Maybe you'll want to see this movie more than once, maybe never more, but it will stay in you mind forever, for sure, remember it's irreversible...

B00008J2DQ|2.0|Godsmack was good for 2 albums. S/T was a start of a new wave of real metal. AWAKE was Fresh And More To The Point. This One Is The Same SH*T As The The Other Two. The Sound Is No Different, The Vocals On This One Have Really Lost Their UMPH! And The Sound Is The Same As &quot;Awake&quot;. Its All The Same, Nothing New. I Thought These Guys Would Be Different  From Other Sell Outs Like Metallica And COC. BUT THEY HAVE OFFICIALLY GONE TO HELL!!!

B0000AXE8I|1.0|this movie is just like a buffet, a chop-suey, a mixture of terminator 1-3 + lord of the ring + star wars + the 5th element + tron + the tv sitcom, dark angel....etc., etc.....and all the sections of all the sci-fi movies that this pathetic screenplay writer(?) could steal or, well, could remember, he (or they?) has seen before. its just like a mixed vegetable crap but once put bean sprouts in it, it calls chop-suey. boring, boring and b-o-r-ing. all the fight scenes are cliched, and i just can't believe that it repeated again and again. a total purposeless , going-no-where movie. there are so many scenes that should be cut or deleted but they just kept them to make the movie a bit longer but they never figured out that those boring scenes only made this movie more boring. i've fallen  asleep so many times during watching it and, believe me, this is the 2nd time that i fell sleep, the other one is steven segal's 'out for a kill', a supposed action movie that had made me snoring so loud. yeah, they were trying so hard to reload the cash-in but just reloaded it into a lousy soap opera.
B000066NW0|5.0|I started listening to Avril Lavigne when her hit single 'Complicated' came out and i have loved her ever since! She brings so many new things to the punk/pop scene. Who wants to hear chirpy Britney Spears or boy bands and stuff like that anymore? Avril Lavigne is something we've needed for a while now and she hits the mark with almost every song on her album. And for all you people that don't like Avril, you don't have to listen to her you know! Nobodies forcing you to like her music. Go plug in some 'Jewel' or something. Anyway, here is a quick rundown of the tracks:<br />1. Losing Grip- Good opening song, nice edgy feel. ***<BR>2. Complicated- Tight, catchy, my favorite of album. ****<BR>3. Sk8ter Boi- Very punkish, sticks in your head. ***1/2<BR>4. I'm With you- More of an adult-contemporary song. ***<BR>5. Mobile- Catchy song, surpirised it wasn't a single. ***<BR>6. Unwanted- Good, with a gritty feel. ***<BR>7. Tomorrow- Probably the slowest song on the CD. **1/2<BR>8. Anything but Ordinary- Great song, strange lyrics though.***<BR>9. Things I'll Never say- catchy opening. Nice message. ***<BR>10. My World- My least favorite on the CD. **<BR>11. Nobody's Fool- I looove this song. Really cool feel. ***1/2<BR>12. Too Much to Ask- Kind of a deep song, makes u think. ***<BR>13. Naked- The title says it all. ***
B00000IFP6|4.0|The engineers for these Arte Nova (digital) recordings did a good job. The sound is clear and realistic, but perhaps a little muddy for my tastes. Others might find it warm sounding, anyway, it is not a big issue. Disc one, with symphonies 1 &amp; 2 are superb in every way and I would recommend this disc (which is sold separately) for anyone wanting just the first two symphonies. You may end up thinking these two symphonies are as great as all the rest, by how wonderful the are presented. Disc two, with symphonies 3 &amp; 4 are also excellent. I really enjoy the speed of no. 3, it makes the work more approachable for the beginner, but also very enjoyable for the long time listener. It moves along nicely and it is over before you know it. Symphony 4 is also good, but perhaps the speed on this one could have been a little slower in my opinion. I feel like I need some strong coffee to keep up with this performance. There are other versions that I own that I would play before this one, like the Walter Weller and CBO, Hanover Band or Bruno Walter's version. <BR>Disc three, with symphonies 5 &amp; 6 was my least favorite, neither version would be the one I would reach for. The Toscanini NBC version of Symphony no. 5 is my choice but it's the one I grew up on and so I don't necessarily recommend it, but it's good. Bohm's and Bruggen's version of  symphony no. 6 is the one I usually reach for. Zinman plays this too fast and I would rather walk through the garden than run. By running you can't smell the roses or see the beauty of a flower. Disc four, with symphonies 7 &amp; 8 is a great disc. It's worth getting for just no. 8, with speeds going into 5th gear, it's just what the symphony needs. The 7th symphony is also good, but I would reach for Gardiner's or Davis's 1961 version before this one. Though it has great moments as well. Disc five, with symphony 9 is great to own, if just for the 2nd movement. It was always the one movement of Beethoven that tended to bore me towards the later portion of the movement. But hearing the massive speed increase of the other main section of this movement, it all made perfect sense and I was never bored. I know Beethoven would be relieved to hear this BIG correction finally seeing the light of day. There are so many great versions of the 9th that I couldn't say this is the one I'd reach for, but I'd consider burning a disc that included this version's 2nd movement. Overall, it is a good box set, with lots of details you may not have heard before and the price is right.
B000069AUI|4.0|This album is very good,  a vast improvement over Parachutes, and the hottest new Brit-rock album around right now. There are some fantastic tracks on here, but the album doesn't maintain consistent quality all the way through. Tracks 1 &amp; 2 are great; track 3 is crap. Tracks 4&amp;5 are great; track 6 is crap. You get the idea--in fact I'm sure the band knew it when they were deciding what order to put the tracks in. Let's face it, you need at least 10 to call it a CD. Another quibble is that some of Colplay's styles have been--for lack of a better word--borrowed from other artists. Chris Martin sounds like Bono with a bad cold, or maybe Thom Yorke with hay fever. And what about &quot;Warning Sign&quot;? The riff has been shamelessly stolen from Bachman Turner Overdrive's &quot;Let It Ride.&quot; But this sort of petty theft is commonplace in the post-Oasis era.  All in all this is a solid album, and your money won't be wasted if you buy. But  Coldplay are the reigning kings of Brit-pop merely by default.
0060090383|4.0|Rachel is a young Irish girl living the high life in New York City, but what Rachel does not seem to understand is that she has a drug problem.  When she is forced to return to Ireland and her parents send her to rehab Rachel is certain that this should be treated as a vacation opportunity.  Rachel doesn't have a clue, or does she??<br />This is qute a different type of tale from Marian Keyes.  This is a hard tough tale of coming to terms with life, learning the weak points, strenghtening them and taking on the challenges that come.<br />Rachel's family, the Walsh's are as looney as ever and that is a challenge of it's own, a very large challenge.  The real question is whether or not Rachel can own up to having a drug problem or has the entire situation been overblown by her friends and family.<br />This is an interesting and open look at life in a rehabilitation center from those on the inside and how they learn to understand themselves or continue to live in denial.<br />Marian Keyes renders an amazingly human look at a difficult situation with a soul-touching grace and simplicity that brings Rachel's story home to your heart.
B00009L7N1|4.0|I have been listening to this cd for 1 week now and it is all thta.  Couple remakes I am not found of.  Tracks 3, 5, 7 are incredible.
B000002JSN|4.0|Obviously I haven't been keeping up with my rock-history reading. When I put on my rubber gloves, grab my erasable-ink pen, and descend into the bowels of any Harry Ransom-esque special-collections library, it's not generally the Led Zeppelin archives I'm seeking. What can I say -- life is simply too short. So when I picked up this digitally remastered edition of an old favorite, I was quite shocked to read in the liner notes that half of its songs were out-takes from earlier albums. I don't mean leftover songs that were reworked; I mean bona fide out-takes from 'Houses of the Holy,' 'Led Zeppelin IV,' even 'Led Zeppelin III.' These songs were probably considered too trifling for those epochal albums (though I find their relative looseness refreshing).  <br />Anyways, this handy disclosure of actual recording dates partly explains why the posthumous 'Coda' was so underwhelming: Zeppelin had *already* cleaned house. By the time 'Coda' rolled around, 'Graffiti' had long ago raided the vaults. It also convinces me that by 1974, Led Zeppelin was pretty much finished. It took a slim five years for them to record everything from 'Led Zeppelin II' to the newer songs on 'Physical Graffiti.' All that was left after that was the woesomely below-par 'Presence,' some live recordings, and 'In Through the Out Door,' an album that goes south after the third track. (I remembering blowing my allowance on the just-released 'Out Door' while I was shopping for back-to-school clothes with my mother. Can't get much cooler than that.)<br />As for the album itself, I've always liked its illusion of rawness. My favorite Zep song is \\"Boogie with Stu,\\" so maybe that tells where I'm coming from. (Jimmy Page even gave Ian Stewart a co-writing credit on that one, which sure is more than the Stones ever did for him -- although God knows, they owed him more than Jimmy did. I know, I know, it's that demon life: it had them in its sway.) What we used to call side three in the old LP days nearly capsizes the ship -- \\"In the Light\\" is perhaps the worst thing they ever recorded --  but she's a sturdy vessel both fore and aft and weathers even this storm.<br />Like everybody, I regret the unavoidable loss of the original LP's cover art -- which, with its little windows and their adjustable occupants, was nearly as involving as an Etch-a-Sketch -- but the transition to CD has been done with care. Anyone else notice, though, how that couple seconds of psychedelia that Page's guitar upchucked at the very end of \\"Sick Again\\" has been strangely whacked?
B00000G3I2|5.0|Since this film first appeared about 20 years ago, it has become a favorite of those who comprise what is referred to as the \\"Baby Boomer\\" generation\\" but its appeal is by no means limited to that age group. So many of its themes (e.g. nostalgia, disenchantment, sexual frustration, egocentricity) are common to all generations. As is often the case, a reunion of friends occurs because of a death, in this case Alex whose corpse is being formally dressed for burial as the film begins. (It is Kevin Costner's body but his head is concealed, with the balance of Costner's appearance lying on a cutting room floor.) Sarah and Harold Cooper (Glenn Close and Kevin Kline) serve as unofficial hostess and host. After the burial, their friends return with them to their home where accommodations are provided. Their extended celebration of both Alex and themselves begins, during which Kasdan (who also wrote the screenplay) carefully reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each central character.<br /><br />The Coopers seem to be the strongest, happily married and prosperous but also generous and caring. Nick (William Hurt) is a confused and self-absorbed veteran (in some respects a survivor) of the Viet Nam war. The group includes one celebrity, Sam (Tom Berenger) who stars in a television series. Karen has always been in love with Sam. Now a somewhat unhappily married woman, she struggles with her conflict of emotions (obligations to husband and children juxtaposed with her enduring attraction to Sam). Mary Kay Place is a successful attorney who yearns for parenthood but not necessarily marriage. For me, the most interesting character is Michael (Jeff Goldblum) who comes across as a smarmy, almost desperate social misfit. Although claiming to be secure as a journalist with People magazine, he is obviously desperate to be accepted, to make favorable impressions, and if nothing else, taken seriously. His vulnerabilities are almost palpable.<br /><br />Kasdan and his associates have created in this film an especially effective portrayal of certain values during the period in which the action (such as it is) occurs. For example, most of the characters are almost wholly preoccupied with what they want but do not have. There is a strong element of codependency among them as they struggle to absorb and digest the reality of Alex's death. They are mutually devoted but, at the same time, several seem (to me) to be asking the same question once posed by Peggy Lee: \\"Is this all there is?\\"<br /><br />Much of the appeal of this film is explained by how seamlessly Kasdan coordinates the plot with the soundtrack which continues to be a bestseller. For example, it is an especially appropriate touch that he includes the Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" early on during the funeral service for Alex. Other selections on the soundtrack include \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" (Marvin Gaye), \\"My Girl\\" (The Tempations), \\"Good Lovin'\\" (Rascals), \\"The Tracks Of My Tears\\" (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles), \\"Joy To The World\\" (Three Dog Night), \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\" (Temptations), \\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\\" (Aretha Franklin), \\"I Second That Emotion\\" (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles), \\"A Whiter Shade Of Pale\\" (Procol Harum), and \\"Tell Him\\" (Exciters).reated in this film an especially effective portrayal of certain values during the period in which the action (such as it is) occurs.

B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead are artists first and musicians second. This album seems very spiritual and emotional, but it's not the easiest to listen to. Listeners with short attention spans may give up and groups of three or more may decide they'd rather hear something a little less depressing.<br />This album is really good if you listen to it a few times alone and read the lyrics. It does take some patience. I also think that you have to be in the right mood to appreciate it.<br />That being said, I really don't think it sounds as good as some of their older stuff. Are they afraid that if they sound good people will think they're selling out? You can be creative, artistic, AND pleasing to the ears like OK Computer.<br />It seems unanimous that Radiohead are like the best band ever, but why? I'm sorry; I like Radiohead, but like the White Stripes, they are totally overrated.
0316921173|5.0|I'll admit that the sheer size of this thing can take you aback, but don't be fooled by the pyrotechnics:  Infinite Jest is 100% heart.  I notice that most people's beef with this book is that they have mistaken it for a Choose Your Own Adventure or paperback mystery and that they like their answers clear, their heroes and villains clearly defined and with logical comeuppance at the end.  If you prefer this sort of simpleminded fiction, then by all means, don't waste the time and tendonitis-risk.<br />I think a related novel might be Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy.  Again, this is one big, big book that doesn't give you the moral satisfaction that, say, Die Hard might.  There are no easy outs for any of these characters; the answers here are small, quiet, undramatic answers that perhaps we are unwilling to face for ourselves.  <br />IJ is definitely sad and you can't chart its progress very easily, but it plumbs [or &quot;palpates&quot;, as the author might say] the depths of the nature of addiction, for which there are no simple answers either.  It is by far my favourite book, and I buy up other copies to pass out to people like really big pamphlets, and they have all loved it too.  The fact that so many other reviewers WANTED conclusions to these characters' stories says more about DFW's abilities as a story-teller than his failings.
B00008J4P5|3.0|It's a pretty decent album, but for some strange reason all the corporage mags have grabbed onto the White Stripes and won't let go.<br />Yeah, it's decent, but I think they're so popular because they sound like rehashed classic rock from long ago.<br />Don't buy this unless you've heard it first. Just because the magazines say it's classic doesn't make it so.<br />Also
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Leone redefined the Western with his Eastwood films, then he re-defined his own retooling with this film. A film that had only a 70 page script has some of the most potent Western images in the history of the genre -- out Fording John Ford's best work.<br />The cast -- no one you would expect to be in a Western -- give the film the dramatic gravitas that would usually be lacking in a film like this. <br />Claudia Cardinale steers this film with her great beauty and pwerful, aggressive performance as the homesteader not to be duped or bullied.  <br />Seeing Henry Fonda's stark blue eyes meet out sadistic slayings is a sight to see, and Robards' wily fugitive is comic genius.<br />Bronson fills Eastwood's shoes well, in fact I don't know if Eastwood would have been good for the film, but Harmonica isn't as pivotal as Eastwood's Man With No Name.<br />Sam Raimi poorly ripped the film off in QUICK & THE DEAD, and that's a quick example of the far-reaching influence this film has. John Milius (who does commentary) perhaps best appropriated from this film when he directed CONAN.<br />Too bad Leone never reached this level again, the gangster film that shares much of the same title isn't as sharp and iconic in redesigning the mythos of the ancient West, and the follow-up Western is gem, but an odd and little seen gem. Maybe the unrealized Stalingrad project could have been the rival.

B0000AMRJC|3.0|In 1983, I was 18 and remember being blown away by Brian DePalma's gangster epic Scarface, Twenty years later I'm not so sure what the fuss was about. The story is familiar to just about everyone. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) comes to America as part of the Cuban boat lift with literally nothing. He kills a Communist in Feedom City and becomes friends with Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) Miami's leading cocaine dealer. The film arc at this point follows the story line of the 1932 Howard Hawks film of the same title and Montana rises to be a powerful drug lord. Eventually getting in trouble because of his own need to achieve he is then brutally murdered by the Columbian cartel. Limited support for Pacino's over the top portrayal comes from best fiend Manny (Stephen Bauer) and a very young Michelle Pieffer who plays love interest Elvira.<br />The 20th Anniversary Edition presents the film in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The picture looks great thanks to the late John A. Alonzo's cinematography but I felt that the sound left a little to be desired.<br />The performances have become legendary and Pacino carries the film with his completely over the top portrayal. Supporting players do little more than allow him to show off his acting ability.<br />Is this grat cinema? After 20 years reflection, my answer would be no but it is a good genre film. The problem is that when this movie came out it was completely innovative in terms of violence and language. Today, we have simply seen this before. The 2:50 length also detracts. There are places in the film where it seems to crawl. Overall, the film is good but it simply is not what I remembered from twenty years ago. Perhaps I'm just getting old.<br />The special features comprise an entire disc but offer nothing spectacular. The best  feature is a series of making of type documentaries hosted by producer Martin Bregman with interviews with Oliver Stone, Pacino, Bauer, and film composer Georgio Morodor. This feature discusses thefilm from its origins to actual filming and ratiting difficulties. There is also  a television edits reel that is more funny than enlightening. A twenty minute deleted scenes feature offers little since there is no context in which to view these scenes and no director commentary.<br />Def Jam has added a feature explaining why the film has become a Hip Hop classic and features many performer interviews. This feature is interesting and offers a look inside the rap industry.<br />Overall this would be a good rental if you're not an absolute fan. A piece of cultural history maybe but not what I remembered.
B00008CLOA|3.0|The CD format of music is great, they last longer, they're portable, etc., but there are albums that need to be heard in their original format to fully be appreciated. This is one of them. If you are truly a fan of Pink Floyd, it is money well spent to buy a quality turntable and locate a pristine copy of this in Album format. Original analog recordings just don't sound correct in a digital format.
B00006LI4S|4.0|hi there all, thought it was time i sat down and wrote another review. I got this dvd as a christmas present from my mum and plonked it on the dvd player and watched it over and over. &quot;Shine on&quot; played on an accoustic? could it be pulled off? well folks the answer is yes, David pulls it off brilliantly and to add to the brilliance of it, it is ended with the electric version later in the concert. some songs are a little wishy washy for my tastes, but hey take the good with the bad. <BR>Now any of you who have read any of my reviews, will know comfortably numb is my all time favorite pink floyd song. i have to admit, i dont watch Robert Wyatt singing Rogers lyrics. no no no no no, out of time, no enthusiasm and just ruined it for me <BR>:( however bob geldoff redemms the song at the end of the dvd to an extent, but sorry guys, no one and i mean no one can replace roger on this song. Was a tad disapointing to see gilmour standing there, unshaven, in a tee shirt and really not looking his gretest, the extra footage at the end of the concert looks good with him dressed smartly and at times i wish the whole concert looked like that. but hey i am rambling on about fashion, when i should be rambling about the music. I know pink floyd will never tour again, i am just waiting for roger waters new album and ptoential tour. This is the closest i will get to the rock gods, so i shouldnt moan, i should sit back and enjoy as should you all with this dvd and other pink floyd concerts.<br />Shine on everyone<br />Scotty
B0000B1OFL|5.0|First off you gotta love the cast. Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, and Donald Sutherland. Then you gotta love the mini coopers - the coolest cars around. And beyond that there is a decent storyline - simple - but well done. The chase scenes are exciting and the movie is fun to watch. A group of high-tech, expert thieves loot millions of dollars worth of gold bars from Italy. But they don't quite get away with the spoils. . . The movie gets emotional enough without losing its mostly light-hearted nature. There aren't any major plot twists or any sort of seriously intense drama - this one is mostly about fun. A real pleaser.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I believe with all my film-lover's heart that \\"The Matrix\\" is one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, if not arguably one of the greatest MOVIES ever made. Now, let's talk about \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\", which is, in short, an ENORMOUS disappointment in the context of the potential of the series. \\"Reloaded\\" has one huge problem with it - it takes itself WAY too seriously. The first film wasn't afraid to happily wallow in its hokey dialogue and cheesy plot, but this one simply loses the charm of the first film and actually tries to be something more than it is. Yes, the fight scenes are great (though some commit the sin of overkill - a nearly 15-minute car chase just loses something after 10 minutes), the effects are great, and it stays visually true to the first film, but the movie gets lost in its own philosophy, not to mention indulgence. The huge \\"orgy\\" scene has few rivals when it comes to \\"Most Pointless Scene Of All Time.\\" Sure, the Wachowski's were trying to show that the people were becoming part of a community, but those points could have been made in a more subtle, relevant manner. I do admire at points the times when they do try to add emotional depth to the film, with Morpheus's relationship and the growing bond between Neo and Trinity, but it just doesn't work in the context of the film. Whatever happened to being a good old-fashioned sci-fi movie? I love a comment from a critic at Entertainment Weekly that said, paraphrased, if Neo ordered food from McDonald's, he would (in this film) most likely launch into a deep spiritual battle over whether he was destined to super-size that or not. It totally captures the overdone nature of the film. All in all, the movie just doesn't know when to stop. Sure, they need to keep the plot going, but if it means putting out subpar offerings like \\"Reloaded,\\" maybe they should have just left \\"The Matrix\\" as a movie and not a whole trilogy.
B0000028PL|5.0|When Stain came out in 1993, it was lost in a sea of the new music of grunge and alternative, seemingly meant to be forgotten.  What ended up was a perfect album with the new member of Doug Wimbish who within 30 seconds of his introduction flattens any pre-conceived notions and questions of his ability to replace former talented bassist Muzz Skillings.<br />Stain is an album that has perfect flow, great groove, killer sonic power, and songs that hold your attention one after the other.  The band litteraly plays it's BUT off, and the album is not just mixed with the great talent of rock musicianship, but also of various styles, and with some good industrial sampling to boot.<br />Lyricaly it's also the most provocative, from songs of alienation , guilt and indifference ('Go Away', 'Ignorance is Bliss', 'Leave  It Alone'), humour ('Bi', 'Mind Your Own Business'), political issues ('Auslander', 'This little Pig', 'Wall') and touching moments typified in 'Hemp' and the brilliance of the track 'Nothingness'.<br />The album is in simply one word: flawless.  It was a crying shame that the band called it quits after this album.  The darkness of this album and it's previous album 'Times up' was an oddity compared to it's fun rocking begginings long since past.<br />The album has everything including the kitchen sink.  Gem mint, get it.
B000089CJI|3.0|I was intrigued upon the first listening. The sort of &quot;techno&quot; sound quality coupled with the casual, &quot;average guy&quot;-type vocals and the conversational lyrics were a little unusual. So I bought the CD. The style is maintained throughout but becomes a little tiresome as it goes along. The production is terrific, the composition fairly strong but the vocals seem uninspired and a little too pedestrian. The lyrics are good conversations but are somewhat aimless.<br />To their credit, they have a unique sound that is refreshing but is not one that will stand up over time. Better than most but somewhat below the truly great.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Yet another one of the bands to come out of the garage revolution. All these bands, the Hives, Strokes and White Stripes of this world have been grouped together in one easy to handle package, but truthfully they are very different. Like the above mentioned bands their influences lie in the 60's and 70's era of rock n roll that was the golden age, and wear their influences on their sleeve. They aren't exactly re-inventing the rock n roll wheel but who cares? Really?<br />'Are You Gonna Be My Girl?' may have a passing resemblence to 'Lust For Life', but believe me when I say it's a good thing. This cd is all leather pants, loud guitars and screeching vocals, the kind of stuff mothers hate and we all love. 'Rollover DJ' will have you singing along in no time when he sings 'Now I know that you think you're a star/a pill popping jukebox is all that you are'. 'Last Chance' and 'Take It Or Leave It' will swipe off your head when you turn up the volume, and the brilliant piano work will have you shedding a tear or two in the Wish you were here-ish 'Look what you've done'.<br />Forget about all the stuff you've read about them being nothing new. They aren't anything new. But they rock. Grab a beer, turn up the stereo and enjoy. This is a fine cd.

0140135154|2.0|This book had some insights, but overall, I found myself quite disappointed by it. Dedicated to attacking the viewpoint of the privileged élite creators of high-art standards of correctness with very little basis for such attacks, ways of seeing seems to be filled with implicit assumptions that are neither inherently obvious nor easily divined from the context of the text.<br /> For example, in the first essay, Ways of Seeing attacks art history, quoting pages  of an art history book on Frans Hals, saying that it demonstrates mystification by focusing on technical aspects such as contrast and texture. Yet Berger does not make clear why the privileged perspective of Hals work that focuses more on the nature of the painting itself than the message it conveys is less correct than some other way of interpreting Hals work. While he claims such methods of interpretation and analysis of art are tools of the privileged ruling class to enforce their privilege, this fact does not make such methods of interpretation and analysis less correct than methods that are not used as tools for enforcing ruling class hegemony.<br /> His attacks on the baselessness and vacuousness of art history are especially grating given the glibness of his own analysis of art: in the middle of essay 5, Berger asserts, after handily dismissing mythological paintings as vacuous, that paintings of the poor  &quot;assert two things: that the poor are happy, and that the better off are a source of hope for the world,&quot; based on the evidence that the poor people in painting are smiling.  In the end of essay 5, he says that an early painting by Rembrandt &quot;as a whole remains an advertisement for the sitter's good fortune. (in this case Rembrandt's own.) And like all such advertisements it is heartless.&quot; What more evidence does Berger have in claiming that pictures of the poor are intended to convey the happiness of the poor and the hope supplied by the privileged classes or that Rembrandt intended the painting as an advertisement of his good fortune than Seymour Slive, the author of the Frans Hals work, has in asserting that Hals did not paint his portrait of the governors and governesses of the alms house in a spirit of bitterness? Even assuming that Berger has a superior ability to interpret paintings that makes his statement that Rembrandt's self-portrait was intended as an advertisement of himself more valid than Slive's statement that Hals' portrait wasn't painted in a spirit of bitterness, why is such an advertisement of one's good fortune heartless? John Berger doesn't explain why. If it is because self-advertisement is a tool of the ruling class to maintain dominance, and because such tools to maintain the dominance of the ruling class put function first and artistic merit second, and because art which puts function first and artistic merit second is heartless, then Berger never makes such a connection clear.<br /> Similarly, in the same essay, he discusses originals of works of famous art, calling the religiosity that surrounds art of high market value &quot;bogus.&quot; Once again, one wonders whether he even asked himself, &quot;if people attach great value to the originality of a work of art, what makes the value attached to the originality less valid than the value attached to the image conveyed?&quot; Berger apparently believes that art has some form of objective value independent of the spectator of the art, but he fails to explain what that value is.<br /> I also found the second essay on nudes is also frustrating in its glibness and dogmatism. For example, starting out, Berger asserts that &quot;a man's presence is dependent on the promise of power which he embodies,&quot; whereas &quot;a woman's presence expresses her own attitude to herself.&quot; It is notable that the previous two quotes do not concern the portrayal of men and women in art, but the actual social presence of real life, flesh-and-blood men and women. While Berger couldmake the case that men and women's presences were determined by gender by their power and view of self, respectively, to persuade most people -- who, I would guess, would say that anyone's social presence is determined by a variety of factors, including gender, the circumstances of the situation, power, and view of self -- he must address other, more common ways of looking at social presence, which he does not.<br /> In my view, the element of the book which I found most interesting and plausible was the last essay, that on publicity. This one, I found fairly clearly written, although I did not always agree with it, relative to the others. The last essay is at least coherent and thought provoking.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Rita Hayworth went down in Hollywood history as the Love Goddess.  Her title role in *Gilda* (Columbia Pictures, 1946) leaves no doubt why.  Yet here she is much more than a sex symbol. For one thing, Rita was a seriously talented actress.  For another, she was one of the best dancers in films.  To this day her performance in *Gilda* remains unrivaled as a combo of skill, sensuality, sensitivity, and sheer drop-dead pulchritude.  Columbia's catchy ad-phrase for the film was, \\"There never was a woman like Gilda.\\"  You'd better believe it. Glenn Ford perfectly fills out the character of Johnny Farrel, the young gambler who hates to love femme fatale Gilda.  In return, Gilda loves to hate Johnny.  George MacReady offers an outstanding performance as murderous Ballin Mundson, the man Gilda fears.<br />If you like movies that challenge the viewer to figure out hidden meanings, then *Gilda* is for you.  \\"Maybe that stands for something,\\" Rita-as-Gilda says near the beginning; \\"Maybe that means something,\\" she says near the end.  Halfway through she says, \\"Any psychiatrist would say that means something.\\" The question of interpretation hangs over the entire film, loaded as it is with symbolism and double-entendres.  <br />On the other hand, you can ignore the subtext and enjoy *Gilda* as a noirish romantic mystery-thriller.  It's a beautiful flick to look at in black and white, and it's never boring, even all the decades since it was made.  Some reviewers say the plot is difficult to follow.  I don't agree; the story is both logical and economical.  But that may be because I understand *Gilda* to be a dramatized introduction to the psychological concepts of C.G. Jung.  Never mind.  If you like your movies to be just movies, *Gilda* tastefully blends ingredients from *Casablanca*, *The Maltese Falcon*, *Notorious* and *The Big Sleep*, then stirs in its own original sauce.  In my opinion, it's an improvement upon those classics, as fine as they are by themselves.  <br />I wouldn't call *Gilda* a true film noir, for the reason that at the end the male and female leads are triumphant instead of tormented.  Great films of the 1940s that had real \\"noir\\" (black) denouements are *Criss Cross*, *Detour*, *Double Indemnity*, *Scarlet Street*, *The Killers* and *The Postman Always Rings Twice*.  Still, on their way to a happy ending Johnny and Gilda pass through a landscape that is darker and more suggestive of spiritual abandonment than most '40s film noirs dared explore.  At the same time, because of the intense chemistry between the leads, *Gilda* sizzles hotter than any film of that period I can think of.       <br />Love the music too.  Five stars.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.
0440237688|5.0|Looking at the cover, it does not appear to be entirely too appealing, but the inside is what holds captive a jar of suspense, happiness, sadness, and a lillte bit of everything else that Lois Lowry meticulously inserted on each page of this wonderful book.<br />  The main character is Jonas, a boy at the age of eleven. This book takes place in a future utopian society, where nobody has a worry in the world . . . that is, until Jonas is given his life assignment at age twelve. Together, Jonas and the Giver decide it is time for a big change.<br />  This book includes a little mystery, magic, and everything in between! I know that any readers of The Giver will love it, and it will leave a great influence on your life, as it did mine. Maybe you will realize just how lucky you are right now.
B000089RVR|5.0|I heard Dido on Smallville last night, and after the show, got on the Internet and bought her album on the Rhapsody Network.  In fact I bought both of her albums.  And will buy the next one and the next, etc.<br />The song selection let's the listener enter a world that only music allows, to touch the outer limits, relax, and dream.<br />I hope she gets a video out soon.  Her web site has a few clips.  <br />This young lady only has one way to go.   UP!
B00008EY9G|3.0|I really enjoyed 'Identity.'  Although the movie did borrow from Shirley Jackson and Alfred Hithcock in a BIG way, it came across as more of a nod to those two greats as opposed to just ripping them off.  I'm a big mystery/suspense fan, and this was really one of the better movies in the genre to come along in quite awhile.  Well acted, interesting characters, good dialogue ... there's a lot of positives here.<br />But man oh man, the ending would have been CLASSIC had the writer and the director just trusted themselves and not given away the plot twist halfway through the movie.  <br />A couple of extra snips in the editing room would have detracted from one character (I'm trying not to give away anything), and allowed the audience to identify more with the ten stranded hotel guests, as they should have been, experiencing the same paranoia and confusion they felt.  It's really kind of a shame, they had so much positive momentum going and they just popped the cork on the whole thing WAY too early ...
B00006CXXU|4.0|I really was happy when I bought this CD. Her first one was a little too quiet for me. This CD she shows her vocal cords off big time. I love the jamming songs and kick ass lyrics. She shows who is boss in this CD&gt;
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is the one that started it all.  The Ramones began the punk rock movement with this album.  The album is full of punk classics like &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;, &quot;Beat on the Brat&quot; and every other song here.  Just buy it already!
B00009TB5G|4.0|First of all, I would like to say that whoever said that \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" is too much like \\"Willow\\" should probably condsider what \\"Willow\\" is based off of. There I said it. Anyway, here is my overall thoughts on the movie<br />Pros:<BR>*Incredible acting and special effects.<BR>*Good sound editing.<BR>*Sticks well to the book.<BR>*Very addicting.<BR>Cons (most of the problems that I had with the movie were techinical):<BR>*When Pippin is about to be crushed by the horse, how is it the he has bonds on before and after but not during.<BR>*How did that orc survive? (the one that was chasing Mary and Pippin into Fangorn forrest)<BR>Overall: Very good movie. It did have a few problems with it but what movie doesn't?
B000068OSK|4.0|The White Stripes first CD is okay. I think they could have probably done better with the tunnel, bathroom sound you hear on Jimmy the Exploder, and The Big Three Killed My Baby. It is good for new starters but they had a lot to work to do to make Elephant as good as it is.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Having had the privilege of seeing the actual concert featuring Jeff Lynne, Paul McCartney, Joe Brown, Ringo Starr, Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Dhani Harrison, Billy Preston, Jules Holland acccompanying Sammy Brown in George's last release before his death- a blow-you-away performance of \\"Horse to Water - an unexpected treat, MOnty Python (with Tom Hanks featured), Ravi Shankar and his amazing daughter Anoushka as well as the film, I can tell you that both are uniquely enjoyable. The DVD will give the advantage of providing both, one on each disc.Do see it in the theater if you can, for that big-screen, being-there effect, but try to catch it in a theater with decent sound! I saw it in two theaters, one with surround (sounded fabulously realistic) and one with a sytem pathetically inadequate to the subject. The film and DVD were mastered by muscican/producer extraordinaire Jeff Lynne, who pays great attention to detail to produce perfect sound, so if you saw it in a less-than-wonderful theater, know that the DVD will sound fantastic on a decent system. Also, while the film wonderfully interjects short interviews and scenes from rehearsals, etc., which are quite enjoyable, know that the actual concert is longer and you can see it in its totality on the second disc.<BR>It will surely touch your heart - lots of love projected - and DO stay for the end credits for something you won't want to miss.
B00005B36H|5.0|About 4 months ago, the beginning of my summer before my senior year in high school, i gave lateralus a listen ( i burned the cd ). after listening, i had no idea what the big deal over this band was, and the only song i could stand was the title track, lateralus. me being a huge deftones fan, knew that the music had talent behind it, but i just couldnt get into it. finally one day i read an article a friend of mine had showed me, it was about a theory behind tool's music, known as the &quot;spiral theory&quot;. basically it believes that the drumming on the album lateralus, when written out, and played, forms a spiral. if u dont know much about drumming im not going to go on and explain the theory in detail. but if u listen to this album, u may notice that the drumming on every track sounds almost the same, and this is your reason why. the spiral has always been believed to be a way of focusing ur attention on certain details, so this is my main belief for why the band used this techinque. but back to the album. after hearing about this theory, something kept telling me to buy the album. number 1 this album is a must buy, just the artwork of the booklet alone, is an absolute trip. their is not one mediocre song on this album, every one being brilliant. if u dont like the album at first give it a little time. everything about it is brilliant, especially the ending. the ending is very creepy, and it a REAL phone call, to an alien show in california, in which a man tried to &quot;warn&quot; us over the radio. halfway through the call, when faaip de ooiad ends, the radio sattellite over the entire west coast went out, and the phone call was ended. when the radio station came back on air, an fbi agent called the station, claiming that area 51 is in no way affiliated with any alien research, and that the man who called will not bother the station again. The date was 9-11, 1997. your crazy not to BUY this album, burning it will be the biggest mistake u ever made, and thats coming from someone who has only bought the new deftones album this year, and nothing else except for lateralus<br />if u like lateralus, i high reccomend 13th step, by a perfect circle, absolutely beautiful
B000089RVR|5.0|I wasn't really planning on buying \\"Life for Rent\\" right away. I was going to wait awhile but after hearing the first single \\"White Flag\\" so many times, I started getting antsy about buying it. When I got my pay check today, I saw that I had my yearly bonus so I immediately went straight to the record store to buy \\"Life For Rent\\" after depositing my pay check. I am so glad I bought \\"Life For Rent\\". There are really no words that could do justice to describe the beauty of \\"Life for Rent\\". I was kinda worried about that all too familiar sophomore jinx that often plagues a lot of new artists nowadays (Tony Rich anyone?). No sophomore jinx here. I immediately loved \\"Life for Rent\\" right away. The music is more subtle here and the lyrics more poignant, if not heart-breaking especially in songs like \\"White Flag\\" which I assume is about Dido's broken engagement to her former fiance. As much as I love Dido's debut album \\"No Angel\\", the album was played way too many times no thanks to the defunct \\"Roswell\\" and Eminem with \\"Stan\\" and his sampling of Dido's \\"Thank You\\". I absolutely loved the gentle acoustic guitar melodies on \\"This Land is Mine\\". That song really took my breath away. It really stood out. I love Dido's choice for her first single \\"White Flag\\". The first time I heard the song, I didn't think it was all that great but as I heard it more the more I became attached to the song. There is a bonus track following \\"See the Sun\\". A beautiful acoustic ballad. I'm not really sure of the title but I will call it \\"The Closer You Get\\". All the songs on \\"Life For Rent\\" were amazing. I loved every single one of them. Of course Dido had her older brother Rollo Armstrong (from the techno collective Faithless, another fave of mine) collaborate with her and he does a great job in producing and co-writing Dido's songs. Anyone familliar with Rollo's band Faithless can hear his influence through out Dido's music. Dido's singing is still as lovely as it was when I first heard her sing on \\"Here I Am\\" on CNN's now defunct music program \\"World Beat\\". It just goes to show you that oversinging isn't a good thing. Dido has a soothing, gentle voice mixed with a obvious English accent. After listening to \\"Life for Rent\\", Dido is definitely no one trick pony. She is here to stay. The four years it took Dido to release this album was certainly worth the wait.g on \\"Here I Am\\" on CNN's now defunct music program \\"World Beat\\".

B000002L9W|5.0|People, people, people.  I have been a drummer since the age of five (yes I can verify that) and have been a follower of all types of music for many years (I am 37 now).  I love any composi-<BR>tion that has some form of musical quality to it--good lyrics,<BR>vocals, bass, lead solos, etc.--not just drums.  And I am here to tell you that this album has every bit of anything that a mu-<BR>sician could love (any real deal rock musician anyway).  This album is also just plain good to listen to.  Let's break this down.  Van Halen versus DLR.  Just to set the record straight--<BR>Van Halen was the ONLY band that could take me away from my be-<BR>loved KISS back in the day.  David Lee--Van Halen and DLR.  I give the edge to VH.  That is where Dave cut his teeth and was given his chance.  Billy Sheehan and Michael Anthony--I hate this one because I love them both--listen to Elephant Gun--sorry Michael--even you would admit it on this one.  Alex Van Halen and Greg Bissonette--almost a wash.  All of you &quot;Hot For Teacher&quot;<BR>people should know that the beginning was overdubbed--even though<BR>it was cool.  Alex did some other cool stuff as well--just took<BR>him a whole lot more albums to do it.  Greg--I don't really know how to compare Maynard Ferguson with DLR.  He is technically a solid drummer, though.  And now for the grand finale.  Eddie ver-<BR>sus Steve.  I LOVE THEM BOTH!!!!  But we have to be realistic--<BR>Steve is Eddie cubed.  The bottom line is this.  I saw Dave and crew on tour of the &quot;Eat 'Em and Smile&quot; tour and I have never been to another rock concert since.  When I left the Summit (Hous<BR>ton, Texas) that night, I knew I could never see another show of<BR>excellence like what I had just seen.  And I have Rush and Iron Maiden to compare that to.  It is unfortunate that the public will not be able to relive or see another concert of that magni-<BR>tude, but they can buy this album.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Christmas came early this year and you couldn't ask for a better gift. This album really is that good.  One critic said it's the best thing they have done since Heavy Horses.  I would put it among their top five.  Ian Anderson once said he felt their music gets more sophisticated each album and it is evident here.  Just listen to Martin Barre's acoustic guitar on &quot;Pavane&quot;.  This group of five talented musicians are truly at their peak in creativity and performance.  The reworking of some of their standards sound fresh and alive.  Congratulations to a great band and if only they would stop by St Louis, Mo. to perform a few tunes.
B00003CXB4|4.0|well, this is not the version you saw in the theaters.  It's close.  But many sections have been redrawn--and poorly.  The Crocks have been redrawn and rounded out.  A Mufasa sequence has been redrawn.  Of course, the SEX/SFX sequence was tampered with a long time ago.  There are other short sequences that have been redrawn as well.  Also the color is significantly more saturated on this disc.  If you still have the VHS or better yet the laserdisc, set them up side-by-side, I think you'll be surprised at how many scenes Disney reshot for this version.  My main question, why?  My second, why use inferior animation for the reshooting?  This is not so much a gripe, as a heads up.<br />Enjoy the flick.  The story still holds up very well.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|OK.  First off I LOVE Enigma.  I have since the first day I hear their first CD.  Each album takes you on a journey and has a message.  I can listen to them over and over.  Their last album, Screen Behind the Mirror, was probably my all time favorite from them.  The message, the mixing, the diversity of the music and the drama all came together for a perfect Enigma album.  So now that I have stated this let's talk about Voyageur. In an interview before the CD came out Michael Cretu said that he contemplated not calling it an Enigma album.  Screen Behind the Mirror was to be the last Enigma CD.  After listen to Voyageur I can see why.  Not that it is a bad CD, but it is not what I expect Enigma to be.  Especially after loving Screen so much.  I feel this will appeal to a younger audience, but those of us longtimers are going to be a little disapointed.  It goes into new territory that I am not willing to go right away.  So I continue to listen to Voyageur hoping that one day I will love it.  RIght now I just like it.
B00005JLSE|3.0|First, if you did not see this film during its regular theatrical run, I would politely suggest that you *may* want to RENT this DVD before you buy it. Since ticket prices have gotten so high over the past decade or so, I much prefer to watch almost all films via my DVD player, rather than fork over the outrageous cost that is now required, even for a matinee showing. This allows me to rent a DVD at a reasonable price, watch it at my leisure, and review it several times if I so desire.<br />Which brings me to &quot;Chicago&quot;. On the positive side, I would say that this movie has excellent cinematography, very good costumes, some very catchy song &amp; dance numbers, and several good performances by the cast. If it really *is* true that the leading actors did their own singing (as is claimed during the film's closing credits), then I must say that, overall, I was very impressed with their performances. I'll be very interested to see if Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and John C. Reilly will be singing again in future films, since they all did a more than adequate job of fulfilling the musical requirements of their respective roles. Hopefully, their voices were not overly &quot;enhanced&quot; by any unusual electronic wizardry, and the singing heard on the DVD is very close to what each of them could do during a live, on stage performance.<br />Furthermore, the DVD transfer is very good, with excellent color and sound. On my 36&quot; CRT HDTV &amp; attached stereo system, the film came through loud and clear, and I was impressed with all the unusual &quot;visuals&quot; that are a part of this very slick production. Thus, all things considered, I thought that the film very much succeeded in bringing this particular musical screenplay to life.<br />On the other hand . . . well, I dunno. It's definitely a dark and cynical story, with very little &quot;reason for being&quot;, and no overall depth at all (a very nice exception was John C. Reilly'sexcellent performance of &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;). It has lots of crude, &quot;in your face&quot; sexuality, along with plenty of totally un-necessary profanity. Why in the world so much of Hollywood thinks it's so chic to use the language of an obscene, drunken sailor is beyond me. When I want to listen to that kind of meaningless garbage, I'll buy a ticket for the cheap seats of a second-tier, semi-professional hockey game. Apparently, this must be a requirement for winning an Academy Award these days.<br />So, while there really are several good singing and/or dancing performances in this film, there's really not a lot that can be said for the underlying story. It's just a series of tunes strung together by a paper-thin premise, and that's probably being generous. Am I glad that I rented it? Actually, yes, since I did enjoy seeing and hearing these actors display their considerable musical talents. And the aforementioned performance by John C. Reilly was enough to make the rental price worthwhile. But I definitely will NOT be buying this DVD, unless I decide to pick up one of the many retread &quot;cheapies&quot; that a lot of current DVD owners are offering.<br />Best picture of the year? Hardly! And &quot;Chicago&quot; simply cannot compare to a timeless film musical such as the equally well-done, but much more satisfying, &quot;West Side Story&quot;. But maybe, like so many others, you'll really like it. As for me, watching this film brought back to my mind one of the many classic sayings from the Book of Proverbs :<br />&quot;Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.&quot;<br />In other words, rent first, then buy a &quot;cheapie&quot; if you want to add this one to your DVD collection.

B0000399WI|1.0|I watched this movie after reading several reviews that rated it very highly. Not the usual prison film with violence, riots, etc., they said. Not true! Here is a movie that depicts and accepts severe bullying, both by the prisoners and the guards. The protagonist suffers biweekly beating and sodomy for the first two years; this is trivialized by the narrator as just \\"his routine\\". Perhaps we are to think that this is a movie about the protagonist rising above such humiliation, but the biweekly \\"routine\\" is stopped only by the guards bullying the bully, and the protagonist rises only by becoming a crook. The ending is such a surprise  that we have to be shown some scenes cut from earlier in the story, while the narrator explains what we missed. But most unbelievable of all is the escape. The protagonist's cell is in the middle of a row, yet he somehow manages to tunnel through the wall not into the next cell but out to freedom! Give me a break!
B000062TU1|1.0|first things first... ARGHEEAAA!!! Terrible movie!!! How can the name Harry Potter even go on this DVD???? I loves the books... and even tho the movie was pretty true 2 them... they just weren't interpreted right. I'll just say this out... all the kid actors were terrible. And if u want 2 see a good fantasy film.. thats also tru 2 the books... watch The Lord of the Rings.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. Poet, Philosopher, Political Commentator, Romantic.<br />From the first few bars of the poignant, sweeping, orchestral ballad \\"It's Time To Party\\" you know you're in for a treat. The song is, in fact, a scarily prophetic reference to the recent invasion of Iraq to which Mr. W.K. was strongly opposed. This song serves as a reminder of the horrors of conflict (...) . Rage Against The Machine would have been proud to have created such a powerful political song as this.<br />Perhaps the most famous song off this album is the equally politically charged epic of \\"Party Hard\\". This deals with the issues of running of a political party, and how difficult this actually is. It convinces me that, if Mr W.K. stood for election, I'd trust him with my vote. His knowledge of political systems to world over is astonishing, as this song demonstrates.<br />Other highlights of the album include \\"Ready to Die\\", a plea to Mr. W.K's brother to leave his job as a government hitman. The touching love song \\"She is Beautiful\\", shows off his romantic side and wouldn't go amiss being played at a candlelit dinner when you're trying to woo the ladies (trust me, it works). And \\"I Love NYC\\" is quite possibly the most subtle song of praise for his home town ever made.<br />Throughout the album, he displays a mastery of several different musical styles. Not one song sounds the same as the last, which is a testament to the musical ability of this man. His singing voice is also something to behold, when he hits those high notes you would think you were listening to the voice of an angel. Really an album that you have to give your full attention to appreciate. 5 stars.
B000002H70|5.0|171 reviewers have already said just about everything one could hope to say about this album.  How do you (well, how do I) describe a work like this?  This isn't an 80's album, or a goth album, and it's most definitely not an inconsequential album.  This is a work of genius of a kind we rarely get to experience so directly (and that's not hyperbole); and if you haven't already, you must experience it.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I was trying to think of a redeeming feature for this album. I found three.<br />1. She is the first Colombian I have heard (and the South American rhythms are there for all to hear);<BR>2. The single \\"Wherever, Whenever\\" is catchy;<BR>3. Lester Mendez is in the production team.<br />However, apart from those lightweight reasons mentioned, there is nothing positive to write about here. Shakira sounds like a very poor Jewel (note the Lester M link with both artists), the songs sound all too alike and her voice is incredibly irritating.<br />By the end - and I did hear it all - I was laughing at how bad the album is. It is, simply, quite dreadful!...
038572179X|5.0|What amazed me most about this book was the level of intimacy within each narrator-particularly the voice of the adolescent Briony and her skewed perceptions of adult behavior. Once again Ian McEwan illustrates the human condition with great eloquence and precision.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Having grown up on Black Sabbath, Zeppelin, the Stones, Queen, and all the other bands that can deliver a hell of a punch, Elephant (and the White Stripes) is a mixture of all of the best things about classic rock 'n roll brought up into today's genre - aggressive and beautiful at the same time. This is one of the best albums since Nevermind back in '91. Jack and Meg White are musical geniuses - period. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who likes agressive blues-rock, grunge, garage-rock, or whatever they are calling it these days, punk, etc...
0451457994|4.0|If I were to rely on this book alone, I would say yes! Although some minor details seem dated in the book, the main concepts and the depiction of the planets are detailed without being boring and sound believable (specially if you are not a professional astronomer).<br />The book has great pacing (maybe except for the first part where the monolith tinkers with our ancestors brains) and culminates beautifully with the transformation of Bowman into the star-child.<br />If you have already seen the movie or even read the book previously and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend this paperback edition for the rather lengthy preface by the author. There he describes his partnership with Kubrik, his conversations with Asimov (!) and, among other trivia, tells us that HAL has nothing to do with IBM (can you believe him?).
0140433627|2.0|I read a condensed kiddies version of this when I was 8. I liked it better because it got to the point right away and lacked the increasingly dull indulgence in using zillions of paragraphs to describe things that don't really have anything to do with the story. It comes as a rather large surprise that this book is held in such high literary regard. Perhaps back in 18-something it may have been scary but by modern literary standards I'm afraid to say that Frankenstein is gibberish.<br /><br />Perhaps this stems from the fact that Mary Shelley just wrote this for a laugh. She, Lord Byron and another pal were on Holiday in Switzerland and had a competition on who could write the scariest story. Shelly instantly came up with this, which is probably why it seems so uninspired, unfocused and meandering. Granted, the subtext is interesting enough, even to this day, but that's not what the book is about.<br /><br />Shelley does go on a bit. Far, far too much time is wasted on set-up and over-description (her love of the Swiss countryside is evident in the dozens of pointless paragraphs describing the landscape) when it should really just be getting to the point. And then when the point finally arrives...it's underwritten. It feels like the book is nothing but filler. I mean when the monster/beast/wretch/daemon/creature is being created Shelly hardly writes anything. Where did Frankenstein get the parts? How did he put it all together? How did he actually bring it to life? She doesn't even have a full or half-full description of what the monster looked like. This could have been interesting in a macabre way but it's ignored.<br /><br />And what's the deal with the monster going from not being able to speak or understand language to talking like some sort of Oxford professor within a few months? It's so far-fetched and hard to swallow. Tho there is sympathy to be had for the monster and doubt whenever Frankenstein badmouths him.<br /><br />Another problem is the actual storytelling. The narration shifts 5 times in the course of this book and it becomes most annoying. I suppose this benefits the views of 3 different people but when they conflict in no way or contribute to the story what's the point? Frankenstein should have had tighter editing? For what it is it's a decent tragedy but NOT horror of any kind.the course of this book and it becomes most annoying.

020530902X|5.0|Admittedly I don't have the greatest grammar, but it's getting better each day.  I've heard about the &quot;Elements of Style&quot; and feared it would give me nightmarish flash-backs of elementary school English class.<br />As a management consultant, I deal with abstract terms, jargon, and other things that kill ease of reading.  With &quot;Elements of Style&quot; I'm able to cut through the confusion and better convey key strategies to my clients.<br />While my grammar isn't perfect (yet), at least now I have a handy reference that gives me guidance without getting rapped on the knuckles for not paying attention in class.  This short guidebook is so easy to use, I've read it twice, and references it whenever I write.
B00001W9G0|4.0|I have seen aq lot of Barbra Streisand&quot;s movies, and I can clearly say, this is one of the most touching. I can't believe she didn't win an oscar on this one because no scene has ever touched me as much as the tewlephone scene in this movie. The chemistry between her and Robert Redford is electrifying, and their acting and the music are both flawlewss.<BR>However, this movie gets four stars for three reasons:<BR>1. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WRITERS CONCENTRATED MORE ON THE DIALOGUE AND CHARACTERS RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL PLOT. I MEAN, WE DON'T SEE THAT THEY GET MARRIED UNTIL SHE TELLS HIM,. IT DOES GET A LITTLE AWKWARD IN THE MIDDLE<br />2. IF YOU DO WATCH THE GREAT DOCUMENTARY YOU WILL SEE THERE ARE TWO SCENES WERE EDITTED OUT. ONE OF THOSE HAS KATIE DRIVE BY A SCHOOL AND SEE A GIRL LIKE SHE USED TO BE. IF THAT SCENE HAD NOT BEEN CUT OUT, IT WOULD HAVE MADE MUCH MORE SENSE, AND THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE GONE SMOOTHER<br />3. THE POLITICAL PART OF THE PLOT IS VERY VAGUE, I PERSONALLY COULD NOT FOLLOW IT AT ALL. IF THEY HAD JUST PUT IN ONE OR TWO MORE SCENES EXPLAINING WHY KATIE WAS THE WAY SHE WAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER AND SMOOTHER.<br />In general, an almost perfect movie, with a few small flaws that although a bit important do not mask the great movie that is The Way We Were
055357342X|5.0|Martin is able to breathe life into everyone of his characters. He masters all of them. They each have a distinct voice and personality. They respond realistically to their situations. Because Martin has such depth to all of the forward characters, your favourite character isn't assured a continued life. <br />Martin's writing enthralls me. His plot is so rich that these books honestly suck the reader in. When the reader finishes reading a Storm of Swords they feel like a fish out of water, having to come back to this world. That is how well Martin builds his universe.<br />I encourage you to read the sample page. It will help you get a feel for his style of writing and how wonderfully thick the plot is. <br />It kills me that I have to wait for the rest of the books to be published. This is without a doubt my favourite series.

B00008DDXB|4.0|I really liked the movie(this goes for the first one too), but I like the books better. Even though they cut some parts out, the film was great(and the soundtrack ,too) It's great to entertain your younger siblings with. I recommend this film to anyone who has NOT read the book.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Ditto comments. Scenes tooooo long, Orgy and sex scenes should have been cut (no relevance) and the movie was a yawner all the way to the end where it actually started to get interesting and then...it ends. blech!
B00004Z459|1.0|I have absolutely no idea why everyone seems to adore Linkin Park. The music is banal and monotonous. Each song sounds the same, maybe there is a slight variation but the song structures are technically very similar - singing/rapping chorus followed by screaming, and repeat. As for people who think this is emotional - this ISN'T emotional, this album is basically the sound of the lead singer wallowing in his own misery. Each song is so introspective and the lead singer just sounds so pathetic, i want to slap him and tell him to just get on with life. The lyrics are not deep OR poetic, each song is like the lead singer whining about how he hates his life, bla de bla bla.  If you want emotional music, try Jack Off Jill, Opeth, Poison The Well, Funeral for a Friend. If you want real metal, try Arch Enemy, Pantera, Metallica (early Metallica). Just don't try this unless you want music that is soulless, cynically crafted for radio airplay and totally unchallenging.
B000035Z3K|4.0|I think this is the best Dracula film made in sound, period.  It's certainly more gothic and creepier than newer, more over-the-top violent remakes like Bram Stoker's Dracula -- heck, Christopher Lee's first Dracula movie is really the only other sound version that matches this one in my view.<BR>Lugosi's Dracula has a genuine European gentility only matched by Lee's Dracula.  As much as some have made fun of Lugosi's intonations and accent, I've felt that they actually add quite a bit to the role and in addition to his facial expression have sealed him as the real deal as far as Dracula is concerned.<BR>Fans of older silent German expressionist films will also appreciate the lighting and eeriness in this and other Universal horror films.  Really, in all honesty,I've felt that the lighting effects and atmosphere in many B &amp; W films of the 30s and 40s is BETTER than what's managed today in full color!<BR>That said, WHY are the black and white Universal horror films ALL OUT OF PRINT?  This just doesn't make sense!  Honestly, I managed to snag 4 films before they disappeared and I would have loved to collect the further screen adventures of Karloff, Lugosi, AND Chaney (who I completely missed out on).<BR>It's amazing that Universal let these films go out-of-print.  They're much loved by people, and we should be able to see them on DVD anytime we want and at more times in the year than just Halloween.  Oh, it's nice AMC and TCM are showing the films now, but I'm at the mercy of their scheduling and availability of tapes and DVDs (if they have them) at the local videostore!  Universal is BLOWING it as far as die-hard fan collectors of these films are concerned by limiting their availability.  These should be back in print, ASAP!<BR>I can't for the life of me understand WHY they let the films go out of print and WHY there was no major Disney-like announcement to the fact that Universal let the films' DVD print runs end.
B0000067L4|5.0|It's always amazed me that so few people realize how great this album really is.  Many criticize it for just having &quot;long jams&quot;. That's kind of like criticizing John Coltrane or Miles Davis for playing &quot;long jams&quot;. But this is what made Cream great.  They were the greatest instrumental and improvisational band in the history of rock music with phenomenal guitar solos by Eric Clapton and with amazing interplay between Clapton's guitar and Jack Bruce's great bass playing. Why anyone would prefer their first two studio albums with only one or two choruses of guitar solo to this is beyond me. And on top of it Badge on this album has in my opinion Clapton's most beautiful studio guitar solo ever. Only Wheels of Fire can compete with this album, but in my opinion only Crossroads on that album attains greatness, while all three live tracks on this album do. Just listen to the intro guitar chorus on Sitting on Top of the World. It still sounds unreal today, but I remember hearing it back when this first came out, and it was stupefying. I remember after seeing Cream perform live Steve Miller said about Clapton that he couldn't believe that anyone could be that good. That's the kind of playing that's on this album. My guess is that the people who rate this album poorly see rock music essentially in terms of songs and singing and do not understand great instrumental music.  But most of the world's greatest music is instrumental music, and Cream provided the greatest instrumental music in the history of rock music.
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis: Bold As Love, Hendrix's second album, is often unfairly over-shadowed by the explosive, hit-filled debut \\"Are You Experienced?\\".  This is really unfortunate because its a gem from first to last.  Hendrix focused more on using sonic experimentation to fit the confines of well-crafted rock, funk and ballads on this one, and came out with a masterpiece.  If you are new to Hendrix, you probably won't recognize too many of the songs on here.  But they are all great and among the best he's released.

The real cool thing is that Bruce Lee isn't up against a huge dude who can beat him in one punch. Noone can even compare to Bruce Lee and his fighting. <br />The action is plentiful, some comedy too.

B00004R99J|3.0|Pocahontas Movie Review<br />In the summer of 1995 a Disney director named Roy Disney released an animated movie of a Native American girl named Pocahontas. Pocahontas  belonged to an Indian tribe called the Powhattan tribe who wanted to live peacefully with the English settlers, but the Indians and the settlers continuously fought for land. This movie shows the love between Pocahontas and John Smith. This tells me that Disney didn¡¯t do much research , and therefore did not show a  historically correct motion picture. Disney exaggerated to the extent that they even change her name which was originally Matoka. I personally liked it as a kid, but when I found out the true facts, I felt cheated that Disney could teach kids the opposite of history. In this report  I will show you how Disney could have made Pocahontas a better movie. <br />I now think Disney would have made a better movie by showing people the true facts, for instance in the second movie they showed Pocahontas marrying John Smith¡­now I know this is not true. The movie indicates that John Smith and Pocahontas had a good relationship but in real life Smith took advantage of her fame after her death and they were not friends during her life time. The movie is entitled Pocahontas so it should depict more of her true life rather than that of the perfect life.<br /> Quite honestly more parents would buy into a movies with real facts presented well by Disney. These are some of the reasons why I think Disney should make another motion picture (Pocahontas-THE TRUE STORY!).

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is quite frankly one of the best bands out there on the charts. Not surprising to see the same is true for the album that features their recent hits to also be on of the best albums of the year. It seems Linkin Park have decided not to waste time trying to be the next Korn or Beastie Boys, and instead decided to stay true to themselves. I wouldn't suggest this album for a person into Metal, but someone who likes Rock/rap/sampling type music thats sad. 1. Foreword - Intro Track for Don't Stay.... .. 2.

B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK is my new idol.<br />Here, his beautiful haunting melodies are plainly obvious from the epic \\"Party Hard\\" to the magnificent and groundbreaking \\"Ready to Die.\\"<br />WK has the soul of a poet, and his soaring acoustic melodies leave me wanting to know exactly what makes this deeply complex and intrigueing man tick.<br />The highlight of the album for me though, is the deceptively simple \\"Girls own love,\\" which gets more poignent every time I hear it.<br />5 Stars, I await his next offering with deeply held breath.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Great overall movie, I don't think anyone will disagree with the animation, songs, and overall quality.  It is a definite purchase.  However, I would recommend buying it from Wal-Mart for $14.87.  I believe this price is valid for the first week.  Great bargain.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Last week I finally purchased the last Johnny Cash Album, \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\\"  After listening to it about 200 times, I finally decided to write some thoughts about it.  But first, let me preface that I have always like Johnny Cash, but have never been a fan of \\"country.\\" Cash always hit me as a bit of a hybrid rock/folk/country which somehow appeals to me.<br />This album is an instant classic, IMO. This is by far the best and most authentic collection of songs I have heard in a decade. Every song is a gut-wrenching song that seems to say either<BR>     1. I miss you Rose, (his wife),<BR>     2. I am sorry, son, that I neglected to spend time with you,<BR>     3. I am sorry that I hurt those through my addictions,<BR>     4. I am dying and just want to say, \\"goodbye.\\"<BR>It seems that he died a very lonely and sad man and every song builds upon the sadness of the previous.<br />The most interesting of these songs are \\"The Man Comes Around,\\" \\"Give My love To Rose,\\" \\"Hung My Head,\\" \\"First Time I Ever Saw Your Face,\\" \\"Personal Jesus,\\" and his finale - \\"We'll Meet Again.\\"<br />In \\"The Man Comes Around,\\" the theme is established early. Clear references to the \\"end time\\" parallel the point in his life upon this recording. Serving as a warning to some and as a prelude to the remainder of the album, this song concludes with a bit of spoken scripture: \\"And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hell followed him.\\" To me, this chilling close was an admission of his own mortality and approaching death.<br />\\"Hurt\\" quickly follows the scripture and picks-up where the previous left off. In what seems to be an apology for all those he hurt during his drug-addicted days, this song also speaks of his feelings and abandonment. Alone in the world, Cash uses this song and seems to turn inward, focusing on the hurt he caused others as a way to express his own hurt and grief. While I had heard the song and seen the video, it's placement after \\"The Man Comes Around\\" magnifies the message and builds a wall of sorrow that is not easily ignored.<br />The third song, \\"Give My Love to Rose,\\" continues the album's feeling of sadness by adding his bereavement of Rose Carter Cash to the emotion of the album. As the title suggests, his heart aches from the loneliness and loss of his soul mate.<br />\\"Hung My Head,\\" seemed to revisit his well-publicized addictions and self-destructive behaviors that nearly destroyed his career. In the tale of a boy who accidentally kills a rider, the boy hangs his head at every stage of his life until he is ultimately hung for the crime. At the end, the one whom he killed arrives on a horse to take him to the Promised Land.<br />The mourning over the passing of his wife continues with his cover of \\"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face.\\" While I could explain in depth, the song title explains the concept with adequate clarity. The difference is that Cash's strained voice sounds like a man in pure agony. He sounds like he is about to cry at any moment and I have to admit a lump form in my throat just listening to him.<br />A few songs later, \\"Personal Jesus,\\" a cover of the 1980's Depesche Mode dance song, begins. Using an acoustic guitar, his grizzled voice, and a few backup singers, he turned this song from a song about casual sex and bravado into a song of faith and spirituality. All the while, maintaining the lonely and depressing tone of the compilation.<br />In the end, his finale (for the album and his life) was \\"We'll Meet Again\\". In an apparent attempt to leave his fans on an \\"up note,\\" this cover departed from the rest of the alum and seemed to say goodbye in a way that I believe many would like to replicate. In a speaking tone, he almost seems to say \\"I'm dying and I know it. But I am happy to leave and you should be happy for me. Thank you and farewell.\\" This was a major departure from the use of the song during it's peak when the British used it in tongue and cheek tobroadcast the \\"all clear\\" after Nazi Bombing Raids in WWII. Nevertheless, it was an effective conclusion for a great album and a great artistic career.<br />After I removed the CD after my first listening, I realized that I had not just listened to one of the best American albums of all-time. This was also one of the best self-eulogies I have ever heard and done in an artistic, artful, and tasteful manner.<br />If you have not purchased an album in a while, buy this one and listen to it alone. You will not be sorry.
B000001ZS3|5.0|Wow this music is excellent. I feel a part of the wonderful atmosphere and after watching it on tv the other day, i couldnt find anything better to listen to. I cant find a fault with it and as it has no words, it brings a new meaning to everyone and doesnt restrict youre imagination. <BR>Thank you Jean Micheal
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park is quite frankly one of the best bands out there on the charts. Not surprising to see the same is true for the album that features their recent hits to also be on of the best albums of the year. It seems Linkin Park have decided not to waste time trying to be the next Korn or Beastie Boys, and instead decided to stay true to themselves. I wouldn't suggest this album for a person into Metal, but someone who likes Rock/rap/sampling type music thats sad.   1. Foreword - Intro Track for Don't Stay.... .. 2. Don't Stay - A simple heavier track to start out the album. Not going to be a major hit. ...85%3. Somewhere I Belong - The first radio hit for this album, It's a tad heavy and has quite a bass sound to it. ....95%4. Lying From You - Cool samples in the music, It features Rap vocals on verses with yelling Chorus. It's a good track, but not a radio track. It's for the fans... ..95% 5. Hit The Floor - Simple track with rappy soft verses with yelling chorus. It's an ok song. ...85% 6. Easier To Run - I think this should be a radio hit, it's so deep. It reminds me of softer vocals on &quot;Crawling&quot;. I even dig the rap vocals which is sometimes hard for me since I'm not a fan of rap music. It's my personally favorite. ...100%   7. Faint - Second Radio Hit and the best track on here! I love the samples and the music. Good song all around. You can't help but connect with the lyrics. Everyone has those feelings. Surely the song of the year. ....100% and *plus* 8. Figure.09 - A decent song that has a few new ideas. If anything the guitar was good in this one. ...90%   9. Breaking The Habit - Another good song that s not being played on the radio *yet*. It's not a normal Linkin Park song and it, only has normal singing and a few yells in the bridge. I like the Samples and the lyrics. .. 95% 10. From The Inside - Soft vocals and soft rap vocals for the verses, and sort of louder chorus. It's a good song. ...95%  11. Nobody's Listening - Very cool Samples. The most rappy song on here. But anyone can understand these lyrics. Very good track that wont end up a radio hit, but the fans will dig it. ...95% 12. Session - It's a instrumental that just doesn't work. Perhaps the only track I skip on the album. ....60%13. Numb - The third radio hit. I didn't see this one being a radio song, but it seems to be decent. ...90% (Computer content I am unable to look at)(Dvd) - A ok 30 minute video of the boys showing how they made the album. Includes the making of the artwork for the album, how each member came about doing his part in this album, and also explains how the band named the album &quot;Meteora&quot;. It's decent interesting stuff, and its interesting seeing some of their gear and stuff. Go for this Dvd if your interested in the more musical side of the band, or just love some songs on this album. ...90% If you like this album, you should also check out..: Linkin Park- Hybrid Theory, Staind -14 shades of grey, Evanescence- Fallen, Evergrey- In Search of Truth, Staind - Break the Cycle, and Evergrey - Recreation Day *Limited Edition*
6301955676|3.0|this movie is really gorey and really funny at times. Combs has never been better and he gets inside his character well but theres a lot of things that I really felt that this movie was gonna suck and some of that was true. now with a cut off head with bat's wings and the finale which was really dumb, i'd say Yuzna smashed the cult hit off its throne but he didnt. later in beyond re-animator he does. in this one its cool to watch Abbott being pushed around by Combs and the spark they have is cool. others beware some of the lameness
B000002UJQ|5.0|Upon reading all but one of the reviews on this site, I would first like to say (in a completely objective, uncodescending, and open-minded way) that it seems that a large portion of the reviewers of this album are like lions, taking one side of the kill and running off to devour it themselves.  There is much more to OK COMPUTER and Radiohead than &quot;the best album ever&quot; or an insult to great artists such as Fred Durst and co.  I think with any album, something to keep in mind is what the album means to you.  You being the operative word in that claim.  Yes, Radiohead is great.  Yes, Radiohead is original and revolutionary.  But to put labels such as best and worst on anything is automatically weaking your arguement and turning others away from your opinion.  I feel the best service you, as a consumer of music, can do for a band you love or hate is to say how it makes you feel and hope that maybe it will make another feel something as well.  That's what life is about right?  Taking in your own sensual experiences, internalizing them, and then passing them on to others to share the beauty and joy which you have found from a moment(or several) in your life.  I personally don't care for Fred Durst or Avril Lavigne(or however you spell her name), HOWEVER, I don't waste my time looking them up on Amazon.com to bash on their work.  In the same way, I don't actively put energy into degrading somebody else's opinion or lifestyle for the sake of finding security in my own.<br />Sorry Folks, just had to share that, this is what I think about the album...<BR>This album for me has been a part of my life from the day I first heard it.  Long boy scout trips in the back of a cramped dingy pickup truck seem like such an unholy place in my life at surface level.  In retrospect, being crammed into that uncomfortable seat and being exposed to OK COMPUTER was one of the most memorable days of my life.  From that day forth, OKC has been my personal counselor and brick punching wall.  It has been my guide through social questioning, emotional terror, emotional ecstasy, boredom, and most any other human condition in existance.  I don't think this is the best album ever made, but I surely do place it as my FAVORITE album ever made.  I think it does have a weak point that makes the perfect circle of greatness slightly lopsided and egg-shaped.  That would be that OKC is not an album for everyone.  As proven, it has stirred extreme negative responses from fans of other music types, which is something that in order to become the best, a group would need mass appeal(as goes my defenition of best as I refer to music).  The only band that comes to my mind to come close to this accomplishment would be The Beatles.  This is not to discredit Radiohead, however, for an advantage of an egg-shaped album, is that it brings forth new life, and will be the foundation for a growing genre of original and emotionally stellar music for generations to come.  I personally hope that in the same way that so many generations have embraced Dark Side of the Moon and countless Beatles albums, OK COMPUTER will also be hailed as a pinacle of musical achievement and span the generational gap, ending up in my children's and grandchildren's music players in the future.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was practically the top rock album of the year 2000, and was my FIRST EVER rock CD I've ever owned.  I bought it mainly because of the single &quot;Crawling&quot;, and because my friends told me it was an incredible album, and I needed to check it out.  So I did and for the most part I actually like it.  &quot;Crawling&quot; is still the top song on the album, for me.  The hauntingly weird, yet very well-put together video really got me hooked on this track.  It's like no other rock track I've ever heard of.  Pretty deep, with a little emotion, and Chester stretches his vocal cords WIDE in this one, just as he does in a lot of the other tracks.. he's not afraid to just scream and shout when the time comes, which gets pretty catchy as you listen to the album.  Another MASSIVE hit and stand-out track to me would have to be &quot;In The End&quot;.. I can actually relate to that song ALOT.. It has very deep lyrics, as well as a few nice little raps throughout the track, by Mike of the group.  This song is also a definite highlight for Chester, as well as the group, as a whole.  The song went big, and I can definately see why.. It's an incredible track for them.  Besides those two tracks, I also enjoy &quot;Papercut&quot;, a nice opening cut for the album.. I also like &quot;By Myself&quot;, which is a very nicely-done track, with once again Mike rapping out the verses, and Chester doing a damned good job with the chorus.  My favorite track, however, is &quot;A Place For My Head&quot;.. it has a very original beat to it, and the lyrics are also very original, as once again Mike raps them out, and Chester pours his heart and soul into the chorus.  This is also another song I could relate to at times, and it's definitely one of THE TOP, if not the top, highlights on this album.  &quot;Forgotten&quot; took me a little while to get used to, but it's also one of my favorites now, as it's a hard hitting track, with a very laid-back melodic beat between choruses.  The last track, &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, is also a pure standout on this release.  It's yet another very original track, and a very nice cut, to close out the album.  The album also has a DJ track, where a very nice beat is applied.  After several of different beats, the track fades into one very nice one, that I love.. a nicer, mellow, laid-back, pop-type beat, mixed to a piano.  Eventhough this one isn't an actual song, it's also a definite highlight.  Besides everything I have mentioned, the other tracks are either songs I skip, or songs that are just OKAY, or don't live up to the hype of the other tracks.  But all in all, this is a very nice release, and I'm glad I made my first ROCK experience Linkin Park!  They're a nice band!  You should definitely go buy this CD if you don't already own it.. you will not be dissapointed, especially if you love rock music!
B000002KAT|5.0|This is a perfect album in its own way - there is something special about it. It cannot be duplicated I don't think. It almost seems like it was written in another place and time - it has a surreal type feel to it.
044022165X|5.0|This amazing, \\"hard-to-put-down\\" book portrays the life of a young law student, Rudy Baylor's rather short career as a lawyer in Memphis. Very unpredictable, you will never know what is going to happen next if you do not keep on reading. It is really surprising to see an author that can change the situation of the whole story in few pages and make it sound like a real piece of of literature. John Grisham, with his amazing knowledge of law weaves perfectly the two subjects that don't seem to go together well: Courtroom/law and Suspense. It is really intriguing to see the author give great amount of details about the court that in our normal life would put us into sleep in less than 5 minutes. In this ingenious work of literature, you can experience all kinds of emotion: sadness, happiness, love, fear, hatred...Adding to all the compliments on this novel, this book is frightfully realistic and its story could happen anytime and anywhere around us. In addition, Grisham depicts the corruption of the U.S. Courtroom, the law firms, and harsh reality about insurance companies. This book can be compared to a car with a diesel engine; starts real slow but once it reaches above 100km/h just keeps gaining speed. That means the first 100 pages of The Rainmaker is rather boring but after that 100 pages, the novel becomes a really \\"hard-to-put-down-page-turner\\". <BR>In short, this book is a masterpiece legal suspense novel, probably the best one in the 21st century. There are only two faults about The Rainmaker. It is that the book has a rather deceptive ending and that the book is only about 500 pages...Highly recommended to anyone...Guaranteed.
6304826133|5.0|I like Cop Land because of the ensemble cast of great actors and actresses. you got your Stallone and your DeNiro and your Keitel and your Liotta and your Berg and others that really put this movie to the level it should be. Stallone I think is great in this movie, period. his career got a little down hill when he made Driven and others beyond that but you look back at his other movies like this one and Daylight, Cliffhanger and the Rocky movies and you just remember the good roles. DeNiro is always sparking the screen with his big roles and this is another for his career. Liotta is great also and he's had some fine movies as well like Narc, Unlawful Entry, Turbulence, Identity and a whole lot of others. but anyway, this one is dynamite and it explodes at you. lots of action and mystery really connect the dots and I enjoyed the ride

B00008H2LB|3.0|After my nice listening experiences with Linkin Park's first album, I decided to buy this album, upon listening to the first single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, and it seems like they have changed their style a little bit, since the year of 2000 when they're first album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; first came out.  This CD is a little different, but it is still unique.  &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is definately one of the main standout tracks on this album, eventhough it sounds a little lighter compared to all the material on their first release.  The song, however, is a very nicely done track, and one of their best songs yet.  Other nice songs are &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;, a very [heavy metal-type] of song, and one of my favorites on the album, &quot;Easier To Run&quot;, which is another Linkin Park track I could relate to.  This song is a little more laid-back, which is a big step up for their originality.  It's not your usual Linkin Park track, but it's a very nice one, and it's definately a highlight of the CD.  The second single, &quot;Faint&quot;, is also a nice breath of fresh air, as it resembles a few of the old Linkin Park tracks.  I definately consider this track to be &quot;Classic Linkin Park&quot;, and it's a nice standout.  My favorite track on this one, however, would have to be track #9, &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot;.. a very mellow, and cool track, that sees Chester as the main vocalist, and he pulls it off well, with an amazing track.  This would do an amazing job, if this were to be released as a single and video.  My second favorite on the album would have to be track #10, &quot;From The Inside&quot;, which yet again, is not your usual Linkin Park track.  It has a very original beat, with nice little raps from Mike, all through-out the song, and Chester is showing off his vocal cors, very nicely, unlike their first CD, Hybrid Theory, which had Chester really pouring his heart out into each and every track.. a very rare gem on this album.  This one is a very deep track as well.  The next track, &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;, is a very rare-sounding song to come across, no matter what genre you're speaking about.  This one is also yet another deep song.  And what better way to follow things up, than another DJ track?  Their first CD had an amazing one.. and this time around, Meteora contains an even better one, entitled &quot;Session&quot;. It also has a very pop-like sound to it, with mixings of piano through-out.  The beat on this one is a little more rock-based than the DJ track on &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, which is why it makes for an amazing highlight.  The other tracks I did not mention just weren't up to par, for me, or just wasn't a standout track, and when it comes to that, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was a little better than this one, as it shined ALMOST all the way through, whereas you have to skip around a little bit with this one.<br />Eventhough this album doesn't live up to the hype of their first release, it's still a decent buy.  Like I said, I prefer their &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; album over this one, but this is another gem as well.  If you are a fan of rock music, or Linkin Park, in general, be sure to buy this one and complete your collection with another nice album.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I just listened to &quot;On the Beach&quot; for the first time since the <BR>mid 70s and I must say it holds up very well. I still love the<BR>acoustic introspection of &quot;Motion Pictures&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Blues&quot;<BR>about as well as anything Neil has ever done (including the <BR>great ones of After The Goldrush, Tonights the Night, and Rust<BR>Never Sleeps). The liner notes and original Reprise label on the cd are a great flashback as well.
0345448898|5.0|This book takes you on a wonderful journey through worlds so rich and fantastical that you will wish they really existed. The characters are very developed and they will become your instant friends. There are awesome twists and turns that will keep you up all night reading. I highly and thoroughly recommend these books to anyone with a pulse!
6304118392|1.0|oliver stone mad a mess of himself over this flick. didnt go for me because of its really bad performances by rodney dangerfield, tommy lee jones, tom sizemore and the ever so annoying robert downey jrs reporter guy. downey jr chewed up his scenes. Woody Harrelson was the only one to save this from being a total flop of a gay movie. Juliette Lewis' character is a chick I wouldnt want to have sex with even if the world was about to end and we were the last 2 people on earth. id rather make love to a chimpmunk. they should retitle this thing as  The Natural Born sucks my ass
B000002J03|5.0|Released less than a year after their debut album, Led Zeppelin II is better and more hard-rocking than the first one and possibly their best effort. It also marked the beginning of<BR>heavy metal. Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham sound a lot better than they did on the Zeppelin I and have started to musically mature a little,though they would show bigger musical change throughout their career. The standout tracks include the classics \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\". Also the tracks \\"Thank You\\", \\"What is...\\", and \\"Moby Dick\\", though it sounds much, much better live. The only song I didn't really like was \\"Living Love Maid\\". It's definitley one of Zeppelin's weaker songs (which they rarely do.) Overall, it's a classic album and always shall be. I highly recommended it.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|I have been an Enigma fan for over 10 years. This was the most horrible music I have ever heard. If I wanted to listen to YUCKEY EURO music I'd get it. I will never pay for another CD of theirs unless I have heard it before through someone else.<BR>All the songs were monotonous in the beat with that horrible euro noise in the background. You couldn't even hear the words of the singers properly. The music hurt my brain such that I couldn't even venture to listen to any of it a second time. <BR>What happened to that wonderful sensual music  they had in the first couple of albums. Is there someone else that can create music like that? Cretu has obviously lost his touch.
6301978587|4.0|As an impressionable young guy from Sydney, who was into his &quot;Streisand&quot; phase, I won two tickets to see the premier of Barbra's film &quot;Yentl&quot;. My brother picked myself and my date up in a limousine and drove us right to the red velvet carpet of the Sydney Cinema where we witnessed this cinematic miracle.<BR>Yentl on the big screen was a joy to behold, and quite touching in it's controversial story. For years, I have patiently waited to see this classic once again in widescreen and stereo, but alas, we have never seen this on DVD. Barbra's film is a tour de force of song and story and cinematic excellence, the true ultimate movie going experience.<BR>Set in the turn of the century Europe when the world of study belonged only to men, a young Jewish woman disguises herself as a man in order to learn more of the world around her, and finds the most powerful of lessons, love.<BR> Please, whoever is releasing titles in DVD, PLEASE put Yentl into production, and find the marvelous documentary of it's making, and include it on the end, I still have this on Video<BR> and treaure it. Barbra wandering around with a small movie camera finding just the right locations is priceless, her interview on Australian 60 minutes about editing the film is also worthy of inclusion.
B0000CEB62|5.0|Pay no mind to the previous review, as it appears NOT to be written by an actual DM fan... as any TRUE fan loves the \\"101\\" movie, and has watched it countless times (and will now watch it countless more). The coolest thing athing about this DVD release (in my opinion) is the soundtrack being remixed in 5.1 surround sound! This gives the concert that much more of a \\"live\\" feel to it. I am excited to see the new interviews with 3 of the \\"bus kids\\" as well. Listening to the commentary rocks, as Dave is one of the funniest guys around, and I could listen to him for days, as he tells stories quite well. While it would have been nice to hear Alan's take on the whole event as a bonus feature, he opted not to take part of this DVD release (though they DID ask him to be). As far as not getting the \\"Whole\\" concert as a bonus feature... BIG DEAL! The film \\"101\\" is the reason to watch this release (and includes at least snippets of all the songs performed). If they had decided to only put ONE of the whole songs performed it would have been a nice bonus, let alone getting to watch most of the concert (which is what we get). I think that was a very nice bonus to include on this release, and I can't believe people are complaining that they only get 87% of the whole concert instead of 100% (Hey, they could have given us 0%, you know). Buy this DVD today, and remember your roots!!! :)
6302968100|5.0|I loved this movie because it was a good time. Slater and Arquette worked great together. I liked Gary Oldman's dreadlocked performance and his sorta gangster images and voice. Val Kilmer sorta wasnt seen much in this movie, you could barely see him at all. Brad Pitt was great fun as the druggy. Dennis Hopper seems like a gentle kind of guy in this movie. he seems very calm. Christopher Walken is great as always and Samuel L. Jackson gets killed to quick. true romance is true cool
0790729628|5.0|From the director that brought us Gladiator, here is one of his earlier films that is noteworthy.  This direcor's cut edition gives the real vision of the movie with a much better ending.  Anyone who enjoys Ridley Scott's films should buy this DVD.
0440224764|5.0|This book was so interesting not only as an adolescent, but as a person who wants to be a lawyer. I couldn't put it down. Suspenseful and thrilling!!! I encourage everyone to read it if they get a chance.
0385504209|1.0|This book, doubtless making its author a fortune, is an example of the credulity of even the editorial reviews when making judgments.  I teach religious studies, and have no objection to reading creative reinterpretations or fictional accounts.  But the so-called &quot;historical&quot; basis and &quot;sweep of Western culture&quot; are really erroneous or absent in this book.  Nor did I find it thrilling, which could have made up for its single-minded Catholic conspiracy theory versus real people scenario.  I found the characters wooden and the premise absurd.
B000066C87|5.0|Robert Altman, after doing his last movie Dr. T and the women, has brought us this fine grande awesome british movie called Gosford Park. I liked it on so many levels, one being that Clive Owen and Ryan Phillippe did excellent jobs in this one. I am a big Clive Owen fan, he character was great in this movie and I liked the fact that it was him who stabbed the old guy but you know, that old guy was cool. They couldve done with out all those people and it got confusing to watch them walking and talking about but thats probably part of the plot. hooray for Altman and it shouldve won best picture darnit. it was better than A Beautiful Mind. and another Altman movie I recommend is M.A.S.H., watch it, Dr. T and the women was horrible and  boring.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This DVD is a MUST HAVE!!  I was lucky enough to see this sensational diva in concert here in St Louis on October 4, 2003.  It was truly the best concert I have ever been to in my life!  The DVD truly makes you feel like you are part of the concert!!   The behind the scenes documentary of the show is just too cool and gives one a rare glimpse as to what really makes the show tick.  Having worked in theater myself this really shows how wonderful Cher and her team are!   Although I have not had the privilege of meeting her in person (yet, I hope), you can really tell she loves what she does and loves the people around her.  Her presence is awe inspiring and second to none!<br />Thanks Cher!!  You are the best!!  I Look forward to the other avenues that you choose to express your talent!
B000002BQK|5.0|After years of listening to this album, it is still one of the best in my collection of over 200 CD's.  She has had a few albums since, but none that can reach the quality of this one.  Every song is wonderful in it's own sense.  No two songs sound alike, yet the whole CD flows semlessly from one track to another.  For years, my favorite songs were &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Beautfiul Ones&quot;... then my favorite was &quot;Outside&quot;, now my favorites are &quot;Close my Eyes&quot; and &quot;Babydoll&quot;.  Ultimately, I love each song individually, as they all bring out different emotions in me.  Hopefully Mariah will have another classic album like &quot;Butterfly&quot; someday, but even if she doesn't, this album will still be a classic and will be played for decades to come.
6305971099|5.0|I wont go into the plot coz i'm sure you already know it by now but I do have a message for the people who don't like this film: Get off Halloween 5's back. It is a decent sequel, ok so the teenage characters were annoying, the plot was cluttered and the Myers house had changed but you still have Michael stalking and slashing people and at the end of the day isn't that the whole point of watching the Halloween films?<br />This is the fifth film in the series so it was never going to live up to the original so people should stop comparing this to the first one and just accept it for what it is: a decent sequel.<br />In fact I enjoyed this film more than the original, don't get me wrong, I know 'Halloween' is a classic but personally I think it was less enjoyable than the sequels.<br />Anyway, at least there are true fans of the series out there, like me, and I thank you all for defending Halloween 5 as it is not as bad as most people are saying.<br />Michael rules!!!
B0000A9GLS|3.0|nicely done thriller with a different version of the Agatha Christie novel with 12 strangers stranded at a inn and then they all start to die some how. great suspense and mystery keeps you at bay till the shocking revealing of whats really happening. an all star cast includes the awesome John Cusack and Ray Liotta. The sexy Amanda Peet. Jake Busey, Rebecca DeMornay, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Clea DuVall, William Lee Scott and John C. McGinley are also among the grat cast in work here. but some parts are a little dumb in this movie and could've been done better

B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is a great soundtrack and definitely captures the theme of the movie. It really does make you think of adventure and pirates and the whole deal. It's great fun! I had no idea who Klaus Badelt was until I bought the &quot;Time Machine&quot; soundtrack which is also superb.  The two are written pretty much in identical styles and are identical in orchestration as well.  There is some relation to the Gladiator soundtrack but I disagree that it is &quot;Gladiator on the high seas&quot;.  Time Machine is clearly heard in the Pirates soundtrack.  He uses many of the same rhythms and tricks, powerful horn themes, horn rips, percussion passages, etc.  It's all good stuff. By 'em both!
0385470819|5.0|This book is great so far. I have not read all of it yet but so far I like it. It has a great story line. I usually do not like to read but I want to read this book.
6303566448|5.0|this one is way over the top, with its gorey set pieces and its awesome array of character's. Jeffrey Combs really is excellent as Herbert West, the man who re-animates the people. Bruce Abbott is also good as Dr. Cain. nice beheading of Dr. Hill(David Gale). for any one who has strong stomachs
0812550706|5.0|when i started reading this book i was doing it for a school project. Once i read it i found that this was a really good book. All the twist and turns that happened in this book were always a surprise. I love how the book follows ender from childhood to adulthood. the endeing of the book i never saw coming. It was compleatly from left field. I suggest that this book be cheked out by everyone.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|It should be pointed out that many great composers throughout history recycled material they had written and material other composers had written for that matter. These composers include Bach, Mozart, and Haydn.  It was common to rework themes from previous works and create new compositions. Bach, especially, did it all the time. He had to constantly come up with new material for church services, various performances, and for his students. So he reworked many previous compositions. Film Composers are also pressed for time and must meet deadlines so they have to do the same thing. They have to compose these soundtracks ridiculously fast.<BR>Pirates is a fun soundtrack. Buy it!
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I really, don't know what to say, this is my all-time favorite movie!  Great cast, great storyline, and not so romantic that the man in your life will be able to enjoy it!  A must see for anyone who was, is, or ever has been in love!
0375823360|1.0|I am so sorry i had to give one star to this book. I dont think it deserves it.<br />To begin with we wouldn't have a problem with his atheistic perspective, if it was nicely set, and the philosophical questions expressed in the book were not so completely naive.<br />But the book is a failure, badly written, his author seems immature and so obviously low talented. He simply cannot write. Some of the ideas were pretty good, but poorly developed.<br />The third book, above all, where one would normally expect the stories to come in a nice conclusion, is unacceptable. His ideas remain unfinished, or badly finished, which is almost worse.<br />The beginning was not so bad, but it could be better and we thought it would turn interesting at the end. Lyra was a lovely trump, but she became irritating and indifferent.<br />The author seemed to love her so much, and he thought equally natural that everyone of his heroes would share his feelings. But the devotion of the Texan pilot, or Iorek, or even her mother's at the end, is unjustified. Inexplicable.<br />God, the-bad-guy in the book, is such an idiot. Everybody is preparing to fight the last and greatest war of all, but it's so f***ing easy at the end, the way God, this elderly pathetic man, comes to fall right at Lyra's and Will's feet, so that they can destroy him just like that! A thing that they won't do (they won't do even that!!!) since he seems to die out of age!<br />Metatron is a loser, he falls for Mrs Coulter, believes all her lies, he is betrayed, he is deceived and killed at the end because of Marisa's and Asriel's conspiracy, which he is so blind to detect! Surely an angel of his age and powers should know better than that! Not falling into the abyss, while he could fly, for example!<br />The chapters about the world of the dead were ridiculous. Lyra changed the rules, convincing the Harpies to cooperate with the idiotic alternatives she proposes.<br />The battle was so brief. The Subtle knife, whith which we were promised God would be killed, was used only to open windows, create gosts and peel potatoes. The Aletheometer, a authentically inspired instrument, is not asked as often as it should.<br />We didn't quite understood why Lyra, as Eve, after sleåping with Will, stopped the Dust of slipping away of the Worlds. Mary as the snake was also poorly justified.<br />We cannot understand why this is a children's book, and why it became so successful. It was an adult book, and really bad literature. The author -lector in English Literature- should be better in writing, avoiding all those gaps in the plot (especially in the end, where everything should come together to a logical explanation and conclusion).<br />Pullman lingers here and there, giving us insignificant and useless and boring details, while in other cases where details are absolutely needed, none is given.<br />At last, we are just happy we borrowed it, because if we had also spend money in buying we would feel extremely stupid.<br />Now I am just sorry I lost my time.h which we were promised God would be killed, was used only to open windows, create gosts and peel potatoes.

0142004235|5.0|John Steinbeck does a wonderful job of exploring the age-old theme of good vs. evil.
0804115613|5.0|I greatly recommend this book to young readers because the story is exciting and complicated. The author, Fannie Flagg, uses events to foreshadow what would happen in the story. These foreshadowing make me keep on reading and to have a desire of finding out what would happen to the characters. For instance, when the author describes how the main character, Idgie, changed after her brothers death. Because of her brothers death, she does not wear dress anymore. And she becomes a tomboy who only interested in masculine activities.  This foreshadowing makes me curious about how would Idgies characteristics affect her life in the future. In the middle of the story, the author discloses the secret by describing Idgie becomes a lesbian. The author develops these foreshadowing naturally and inattentively in the story, and they make me to question the story and thus keep on reading to find out the answers. <BR> Although the story is exciting, the author offers humors and relaxations throughout the story. For example, after Leona found out that anger and hate could cause wrinkles (P.35), she always threatens Idgie that she was going to kill her, but kept a smile on her face while she was doing it (P.35). If I picture Leonas face in my mind, it is funny and amusing. A person smiles while he/she yells at other people, and the only reason for the person to do this is for her beauty. Besides adding humor, the author describes food to make readers feel relaxing and comforting and thus, shortly forget the excitements in the story. The author describes the traditional food in the Whistle Stop Cafe in Alabama. The food that the author mentions in the story, such as snap beans, fried catfish, and fried green tomatoes with milky gravy, are special and different. After the author describing how delicious and wonderful the southern styles food is, she provides all the recipes at the back of the book. By providing these recipes, Fannie makes readers to believe the accuracy and the truth of the story. In addition, it is creative and unique. <BR> One thing that makes this book stands out from others is that the book has different settings. The story begins with a modern setting in a nursing home with an old woman called Mrs. Threadgoode talks to Evelyn. Then the setting swifts to a 1980s set in the Whistle Stop Cafe in Alabama. The setting changed from modern to the past, and it is interesting how the author describes these two settings differently but in details. For example, sometimes when Evelyn interrupted Mrs. Threadgoode when Mrs.Threadgoode is telling her story, my mind can quickly re-imagines the modern scene in the nursing home. And then when Mrs. Threadgoode continues her story again, I can go back to the scene in the Whistle Stop Cafe. <BR> As I mentioned before, this story is complicated. In the modern scene, the author writes a story about Evelyns changes in her attitude from hopelessness to hopefulness. At first, Evelyn has no confident in her life because she is fat. However, because of Mrs. Threadgoodes story about the Whistle Stop Cafe, Evelyn gains confidence again. And so Evelyn shows great perseverance to loss her weight. Although this story is not connected to the major story about the Whistle Stop Cafe, it is meaningful and encouraging. In addition, it is more interesting to read a book when the book has more than one main story. <BR>         This book is a great book for young adults to read because the story is interesting and the life of the main character, Idgie, is similar to many of today's teenagers in some ways. Furthermore, the recipes are enjoyable to read even though readers may not try them.
B000001Y79|5.0|In my opinion, No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom is a post grunge classic. Somehow they manged to mix ingredients of ska, rock, pop, and even a little bit of punk onto their album and it worked for them. I honestly can't think of a band that sounds like No Doubt. They were very original and were probably the last great female fronted act before bubblegum music took over. Tragic Kingdom may have some filler, but there are excellent songs that make up for it. 'Just A Girl' is everything riot grrrls stood for in the early '90s and Gwen Stefani took that attitude and brought it into the mainstream. 'Don't Speak' was the biggest hit and captures a certain sort of '80s nostalgia that tears you apart. And when all else fails, No Doubt proves they can really rock out to tunes like 'Excuse Me Mr.' and 'Sixteen'. It's a shame No Doubt took all they had and wasted it on the dreck that was 'Rock Steady'. Hopefully they can pull another great album out before their career ends.
B000023VR6|4.0|This Dre Cd is decent. It is very good at the beginning lyrically and musically......up until song # 12. Then...it still comtinues to be good musically,but the lyricall quality starts to fade. the whole cd starts going downhill after song #12. I still say dont skip this one. Buy it. Its worth your money. Best songs : #2 The Watcher #4 Still D.R.E #7 Whats The Difference #10 Forgot About Dre #11 The Next Episode. Buy It. Its worth the money.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I was at my friends house one day, and we were talking about music. We both liked metal, however he sugggested i try the heavier side of metal. He played some old cradle of filth, which i liked. then he played the title track on this album. <br />It blew me away. The mix of soft and heavy rock was near-perfect, and mikael's voice sent me into shock. All 13:35 minutes of it were godly. Its still my favorite opeth song. It's also the song that got me into the heavier side of metal.
B00008X5J5|4.0|I have a 16 month old son who loves this movie.  He is really into the music.  When the songs start he dances and really lights up.  I have even seen him kiss the TV.  Its a great kids movie.  It seems like all little kids like the movies with the babys in them. Its a great way to catch there attention right at the begining, and then the way it flows with the music and the farries it realy keeps there attention the hole way throug.
6305909326|3.0|This film was perhaps more generally fascinating as a subject and as a theory rather than as a movie. <BR>It builds up with the help of Roman Polanski's unique creation of slicing atmosphere, but never quite climaxes the way you would expect a Polanski film to do.<BR>It seems to have a unique, dark, unpredictable air, but its ending doesn't reflect that and frankly spoils the good work laid down by Johnny Depp. Not one of his best films, it must be said, but a truly awe-inspiring take on the occult, Satanism and the workings of Beelzebub.<BR>You cannot help but be stricken by the clever interpretation of pure evil, the sickening graphic scenes of murder and destruction and Polanski's incredible ability to grasp your attention. It's just a pity that through an intricate, gripping plot comes an inadequate and disappointing end.<BR>fascinating but, ultimately no match for some of Polanski's other films, and other movies of Depp's.

0679601686|5.0|At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.<br />For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.<br />Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions.
B000002UUX|5.0|this album is total masterpiece. every songs are great!<BR>all the riff and solos are truly great. this album is much better then metallica master of puppet or even slayer reign in blood. buy it right now and you wont be disappointed. this album is 10 star
0385504209|2.0|The first few chapters of The Da Vinci Code drew me in to the story.  It was fast paced but still full of details that make a great mystery.  I love how Brown interweaves history in to the story.  What could be better than a modern mystery that involves real historical figures like Da Vinci, Newton and Christ?  Add a legendary mystery like the Holy Grail and I was totally hooked.<br />And then it begins. Christianity is painted as *the* villain and not just a few weirdoes in the extreme Catholic cult, Opus Dei.  Soon Brown's novel begins to sound like an Oliver Stone conspiracy script.  &quot;OK&quot;, I thought, \\"it's part of the novel intended to advance the plot.\\"  But as I continue to read, a new voice begins to intrude into the narrative, distracting me from the story like an annoying buzzing in my ear.  It is not the voice of any character, not even the voice of the narrator.  It's the author, on his soapbox, trying to sell me something.  His anti-Christian rhetoric is no longer a vehicle to advance the story. Sadly, now it is the story that has become a vehicle for bashing Christianity.  Brown ties to be subtle, hoping hide his mesage as Da Vinci's hid Mary Magdalene in his painting of \\"The Last Supper.\\" But, in the end, the book becomes something less than a novel, and more like propaganda.  Try a few Googles and you will find that this novel has fed the fires of Christian bashing.  People are quoting it as a trustworthy source of factual information about Christian history.  But it's just a novel right?  The author can't be blamed if people take a work of fiction and believe it as fact-unless that was the author's intent.<br />Both in the novel and in subsequent interviews Brown makes it clear that he is a true believer concerning this 2000 year Christian conspiracy.  In an interview on New Hampshire Public Radio, Brown said only the characters and the plot involving them were fiction--everything else is historical fact.  Well maybe he's stretching it a little? One small example is that there are 673 panes of glass in the Pyramid at the Louvre, not 666.  Hmmm, I wonder what other \\"facts\\" are wrong?  But hey, in a novel the author should be free to fudge historical facts to color the story--unless the author has a hidden agenda, or an axe to grind. Clearly, promoting the book as historically factual is disingenuous at best.<br />Does Brown have an axe to grind? It's hard to conclude that from a single novel.  But read his earlier book, \\"Angels and Demons\\" and it becomes clear that he has a distaste for Catholic Church.  Perhaps he has good reasons for those feelings.  If so, he is free to speak out against the church.  But I would rather he did it openly rather than putting that message into his mystery novels.<br />To quote Michael Medved (Washington Post), &quot;Yeah, the Da Vinci code is nonsense. Read an analysis of its neo-feminist silliness in that bastion of reactionary Catholicism, the New York Times&quot; (see NY Times Book Reviews, Sunday, August 24, 2003)ittle?

B0000033P2|3.0|\\"...and am a huge prog fan since 1981. I tell you, this is my Number One favorite album of all. And I'm into many, many styles -- from Dylan to Tool to Telemann. TRILOGY is my favorite record.<br /><br />The above is my brief review of the album from about 10 years ago, and back then I gave it five stars. So now here's my...<br />***UPDATE, for the Deluxe Edition. I want to focus on a few specific things that bug me.***<br />1. Original Mix: Has anyone noticed the difference in the beginning strains of \\"Trilogy\\"? The last definitive remaster (Shout! 2007) displayed a very sensible-sounding range of dynamics. But now the quiet \\"strings\\" give way to the tinkling piano with a gradual fade-up, and by the time Keith's ended his first phrase you have a louder sound in a quicker time than I've been used to. I will say, though, that the old Victor Japan release from 2002 does basically the same thing, so maybe what we have is a restoring of the original mix there.<br />2. Original Mix: But what really gets me is the veneer of dullish reverb (or something) that pervades the whole album, despite some more muscular quality that now and then seems fun. The Shout remaster, I think, is truer to the vinyl and tapes and everything that's gone before, i.e., to a crisper timbre and somewhat glassier sound from the keys.<br />3. Orig. Mix: On my computer, the end of \\"Trilogy\\" also came to that crashing halt a split-second early, it seems to me, and I played it three times to be sure.<br />4. New Stereo Mix (from here on out): This time the beginning of the title track keeps a level string theme, NO graduation at all (can't they compromise if they're not sure?) -- and the piano comes in sparkly (not tinkly) and LOUD. A quite sudden and jarring change in dynamic...then it backs down a bit. The first few seconds it sounds like it's coming from across the room, or studio. You might want stereo but, after all, it is from the same keyboard array! I could see Jakko doing some accentuating, but this sounds like a bad, careless choice if it was even a choice. Is this the only way he could get something else done? Well, I dunno what that would be in this instance.<br />5. I for one am not likely to find lasting delight in the now-heard background vocals that appear about twice during \\"The Sheriff.\\" Again, it's like \\"What can we do that's different?\\" Listen to Steven Wilson's remix of Tull's AQUALUNG. He of course saved that album, improving the listening experience even over Steve Hoffman's before him, but the entire impression was one of an intentionally intact, familiar hearing. Not tinkering for the heck of it. And why in the world would you want to almost lose Carl Palmer's \\"S***!\\" (after a supposed misstart)-?<br />6. \\"Living Sin\\": What the hell is with that seemingly extra bar or so midsong? Okay, the vocal thing of Greg's is interesting to hear, but evidently it isn't the way HE thought to mix it back in 1972; therefore, probably, the novel will become irksome in time.<br />7. \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\": Too quick a rise, trying to start every drum hit on a par with all else. Pointless...except for curiosity's sake.<br />8. Finally there's \\"Hoedown.\\" Does anyone notice how it seems sped up?<br /><br />I can't be exhaustive here and now, but these are my definite quarrels with the new AND original+remastered versions in the Deluxe set. I'm sure much of this is also the case on the DVD-A, which I don't have good equipment for yet. My biggest bemusement is that everyone has good or bad to say about the product but these should be obvious things to point out. Bottom line with all the remixes coming out in the prog world -- which I'm for -- is that they should be given a fair shake because they are worth doing so we can continue to play with what is our favorite music. As long as we have definitive versions that stand the test of time. To my ears, the Shout 2007 remaster is the very best TRILOGY to be had.areless choice if it was even a choice.

1400034779|5.0|This was a delightful, refreshing read.  After reading some heavier books, this book was perfect.  You can't help but fall for Mma Ramotswe and her antics.  The author's descriptions of the African country made me feel the heat and smell the dust.  Not every book has to be written for or by a literary genius - this is fun!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Well I have already listened to Long Road Home more from start to finish than I have Silver Side Up! With that said, I'm not sure if this cd is better than that one, but it's sure caught my ear. I think this is an unbelievable hard rock album for 2003: You get what you came for, you get it louder and harder in some spots, it's still melodic, and you get a lot of songs(14). Well worth the money in my opinion. This cd never lets up, it's straight driving hard rocking from beginning to end. Sure some of this has been heard before in spots, but who and what hasn't, the idea is to make it feel new, and Nickelback has done it! A must have for a rock fan in 2003! I know not everyone likes everything, but for my money, this is the best rock album of the year! That is coming from a guy who grew up in the 80's and who's favorite bands are 80's type of hard rock bands. This and the Vonray cd are my favorite 2 new cd's! later rawkheads.
B000089RVR|4.0|It's hard to find someone that loves Dido more than me (saw her 3 times in concert), so I was expecting alot from her 2nd album...satisfied, but could be better.  Then again, No Angel is a hard album to live up to.  Life for Rent is more chill for those of you who's looking for that.  But after seeing her in concert (which I highly recommend) and listening to how she &quot;let's go&quot; of her vocals and the faster/harder live versions of her No Angel songs, I was expecting her to do the same...sing with more emotion and a faster album.  Her voice sounds too reserved, but perhaps that's what the studio wants.  White Flag is a great song and very addictive (sticks in your head the whole day), but for me, my fav song is &quot;Stoned&quot; (track 2)...great great song...nice lyrics and the beat is classic Dido...should be more songs like that on the album.  But for you Dido fans out there, you have no choice but to buy it!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This has to be one of the best new trilogys out there, right up at the top with the LotR series. There is a word of caution that goes with this movie though. This movie is the sequel to the matrix, in the matirx most people got distracted by the action and forgot the VERY philosophical plot. Most people went to go see this movie for the action, it is not a action movie; its a creative \\"thinker\\" movie with some cool action effects. The just of the movie is trying to explain \\"the world isn't real\\" theory from the first movie. Alot of people didn't like this, because they are action simpletons, who don't give a crap about philosophy which is most likely why alot of people thought this movie was bad. People just couldn't take that one part that lasted less than 5 minutes, you know the one part in the white room, where your supposed to listen and try and figure out what that one guy is trying to say. Then there are those people out there that said, \\"he's just like superman flying around\\" hmm where did you get that idea, heres a clu; \\"THEY SAID THAT IN THE MOVIE!\\" duh. And to you people saying the special effects aren't that ground breaking, let me see you do 1 million agent smiths at once, with the exact same face on.<br />Don't see this movie unless, you have a slightly philosophical side. If you don't even think about the world around you at least once in your daily life, then you'll probably not understand this movie.

And Animal House didn't just introduce a new style, it perfected it. With an all-star cast that wouldn't have been the same movie without, to memorable comic gags, this movie will never get old.  This movie could be released in theatres this year and no one would know it was made in 1978. Even if you have never experienced college life (like myself) you will love this movie.  You'll laugh, laugh, and laugh some more.  This movie is that good.
0446530891|4.0|In 1996 Secret Service Agent Sean King guards presidential candidate Clyde Ritter during a rally when his attention is diverted for the longest second of his life.  In that moment a killer assassinates Ritter.  Though King kills the murderer his career died on that day.  He since accepts leg work for a legal firm that pays well, but is quite boring.<br />In 2004 Secret Service Agent Michelle Maxwell protects presidential candidate John Bruno until he heatedly demands she and her entourage give him a moment to pay his respects to the widow of a close friend.  Michelle does but John vanishes.  Michelle's fast track to the White House is now a one way ticket to the out house.  Former agent turned security guru Joan Dillinger is retained to locate the abducted candidate.<br />The cases are similar in many respects.  King and Maxwell reluctantly join forces to find who distracted Sean and who set up Bruno (even as a Buick tracks their progress) as both wants to regain their shattered reputations.  As they follow clues across the country, neither can picture what is going on and if they do they will become victims too.<br />Though quite exciting as expected by a David Baldacci thriller, SPLIT SECOND lacks an acceptable full blooded villain.  Instead the culprit seems more of a caricature than a real challenge to the terrific trio working the case.  The tale is powerful when the good guys interact as sleuths or in a romantic triangle.  Though not quite LAST MAN STANDING, readers will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed tale.<br />Harriet Klausner
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Following a long line of pure excriment that many directors put forth to sadly call sequels to really great films, the matrix II is no diffrent. I have not been more disappointed in a sequel well,ever. The story, plot, drama, and tension have been so far removed, as to give a three hour demonstration of martial arts to put bruce lee movies to shame. The story that is there is so far from being the human tale that is the first matrix, as to put it too abstract to care what happened to the characters, by the end i was cheering the machines. and come on, raves underground, you couldnt find anything more popular, why not just get Britney Spears to fight in the third movie.
B000002I4W|5.0|I am a person who is ambivalent about &quot;free jazz&quot;, but I am not at all ambivalent about this recording. Music politics aside, this record is filled with incredible, emotionally resonant music that will affect just about any listener.<br />Of course, this record is not truly &quot;free&quot;, whatever that means. Nor is this particularly difficult music (although Ornette certainly has that reputation). The tunes are, in fact, quite catchy. As this record has entered &quot;heavy rotation&quot; status, I have found it hard to get this music out of my head.<br />For the audiophiles, don't be concerned about the lack of &quot;remastered&quot; status for this disc. The sound quality is outstanding; the Atlantic vaults have been very kind to the source material, and this is a very good transfer.<br />Certainly this is one of the best Ornette Coleman records out there, and it is an ideal starting point Ornette-neophytes.
B000089RVR|5.0|I had to be at the record shop before it closes to pick up Dido's new album as soon as it came out.  Getting there was tragic.  There were accidents stalling me on the freeway and then another half hour fighting for parking.  Out of my frustrations, I wondered why I was pre determined to get LiFe FoR rEnT in the first place, like movie sequals, everyone knows nothing is better than the original.  Crossed and vexed,  I was thinking that  &quot;this cD better be worth all the fuss!&quot;  Finally I got what I came for, I played it and had a smile on my face after.  Happy to say this album lived up to my expectations.  It's so haunting that you find yourself singing and humming after you've listened to it.  I find the album itself very serious, melancholy, soothing, soulful and heartfelt.  <BR>Dido, it's nice to hear  your voice again, singing new songs with rich and passionate lyrics, there should be more artists like you.
B00000I236|4.0|An entertaining journey down a beautiful whitewater river with an age old theme of good vs evil.  This is a good movie to just sit back and enjoy the ride even though as the plot develops you may feel bit uncomfortable.<br />Meryl Streep is outstanding as usual, however I feel Kevin Bacon is even better as the deceptive, yet charming 'bad guy'. There is also some excellent acting by David Straithairn (who portrays Meryl Streep's husband) even though his character is annoyingly pathetic.<br />The nature cinematography is spectacular and the high intensity musical score only adds excitement to the journey.<br />I highly recommend watching this one on a home theater system with wide screen and DTS sound decoding.
B000002U8I|3.0|Never has a CD been oh so overated.  This is not to deny the talent of Tina Turner.  She has a powerful voice and puts some great energy into her music.<br />However, this Private Dancer record is oh loaded with synthesizer beats and many unatural sounds.  Gosh just listen to I can't Stand The Rain with that squealing noise throughout.  The covers of 1984 and Help just do not work too well with Tina's R &amp; B stylings.  The song structures are altered way too much.  Whereas What's Love Got To Do With It has a couple of decent hooks around the chorus, the song is a bit too basic to enjoy on a constant basis.  1980's FM radio really force fed this mediocre tune down our throats.<br />There are a few good moments.  Like the cover of Lets Stay Together as this tune is very appropriate for Tina's R &amp; B style.  Private Dancer offers some beautfiul piano touches and a more restrained Tina on the verses.  Steel is a good rocker as well.<br />Overall, I do value Tina Turner's guts and determination to make it back in the music world.  However, it merely is a decent recording rather than a reverred classic that pop radio would like to make you believe.
B000002GGU|5.0|This one racks up there with \\"Waking Up The Neighbors\\".  'One Night Love Affair' and The Rolling Stones' influenced (with Lou Gramm on back-up vocals) 'She's Only Happy When She's Dancin' are the best songs to start off this album, IMO.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace is just beauty. Jeff Buckley knew about beauty. Just listen to this. Find your own ways of giving songs meaning. I won't tell you mine. This album is so personal. It's got the songs definately, but that is by far not the best thing about it. The songs &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Lover, you should've come over&quot; are probably the best on it, and really worth a listen. The other songs are equally as good, but it's obvious that the emotion on this album is all real. You can tell when Jeff means it, and that's just about all the time. This is possibly the single most heartfelt and beautiful recording ever to exist. The fact that he died (suicide? not? Listen to &quot;What will you say&quot; off Mystery White Boy and tell me what you think then...) and released nothing else adds to the poignancy. Maybe he felt like he couldn't live up to the amazing album he made before. It certainly seems impossible. Easily one of the most accomplished debut albums ever, and it's just a shame he died before getting more publicly known and spread his talent further afield than what he has done. Incidentally, I think Mary Guibert (Jeff's mother, and producer and marketer and whatever else) is justified in bringing out her sons other songs. Whether they are finished or not, it's important for Jeff's fans to hear more. To know where he was coming from. All he left was songs and if he recorded them, he wanted people to hear them. I'm a musician, so I know what I'm talking about. Mary Guibert is not cashing in on her son's death. It must be painful for her to hear his voice when she allows a CD to be released and she has to listen to it. I for one, want to hear every song Buckley ever did, so maybe I can write songs as good as his in the future. Anyhow, I digress. Just buy it. It's the best album of the nineties and the only ones that come close are bands that know and love Buckley, like Radiohead...buy some radiohead too while you are on the site. I recommendKid A for Buckley-esque beauty.
0316666343|5.0|From the very first page of the book I was captivated until the last.  Some scenes in the book are pretty graphic and you may have to stop reading and put it down for a little bit but I guarantee you that you will come right back to it.  I highly recommend this book to all my friends and I have yet to hear anyone say that they didn't like it.

1400049628|5.0|This definitely is a good book.  I've read a few survival guides that were in the humor section and none were as fun to read as this.  The author uses very dry humor(the best kind)by not being funny at all.  That's what makes this book so fun, as opposed to funNY.  Most zombie stories, good or bad, transport you into the world of zombies, whereas this one kind of brings the zombies out into your world.  After reading this book, I was thinking about making a list of supplies.  That's how realistic this book is.  It's pure fun.  If there were such a thing as zombies, this would be in the reference section.  Very thorough and very entertaining.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|&quot;Oh Mercy&quot; is one of Dylan's best albums, and this SACD reissue is one of the best sounding of the bunch. Daniel Lanois knew exactly what he wanted in each performance, and Dylan delivers in spades.<BR>This reissue really makes this music come to life- the guitars and Lanois omnipresent dobro ring out, the percussion and drumming are crisp, and the atmosphere on this recording is rich.<BR>Practically every track is enhanced by a tremelo drenched electric guitar.<BR>I also noticed how much the closing track, &quot;Shooting Star&quot; appears to be a big nod from Bob to Van Morrison. <BR>Just a quality recording all the way through.
B000059Z8M|5.0|wow! If you or your children enjoy family time watching videos then you should deffinatly,deffinatly watch the set of Toy Story.  Buzz and Woody set very good examples of friendship and the rest of the amazing toys show very good team work.  This video is a video I myself could watch over and over again. This would be a video I would recomend to anyone, of any age, it is GREAT...
B000060OFT|4.0|This was a nice remake of Romeo and Juliet but not as moving as the 1968 version. The 90's time frame wasn't believable. Did Baz not understand what point he wanted made? He tried to have his cake and eat it too and it didn't work. You can't say you don't want Romeo and Juliet to dress like they did in Shakespeare times, then have them spewing Shakespeare's words. Come on this was 1996! Any director with talent could have rewritten the words. If he wasn't going to change the words he shouldn't have touched it. You can't have Romeo driving a Porsche while saying things like: &quot; How thou art? &quot;  It just doesn't work.<br />Okay anyone who's been born in the last two hundred years knows the plot so I won't get into that. I'd rather talk about the character's performances. Leo was wonderful ( as always ). I have respect for him and he brings believeable emotion to anything he does. The Capulet and Montague parents were led by veteran Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino ( fine actors! ). The scene was beautifully done and the costumes ( though didn't appear to be for the 90's ) were breathtaking. What more could anyone ask for? I'll tell you what...another Juliet.<br />Claire Danes is not a good actress and I am tired of people saying she is. She's dry and she has a tendacy to make the dumbest facial expressions during a close-up. Juliet was dainty and beautiful in past remakes. Claire Danes maybe sweet but she has a gawky screen presence and she looked awkward and clumsy throughout the movie. She seemed too uncomfortable and insecure. She was very thin and seemed uncomfortable about her height because she kept stooping over weirdly during her scenes and she began to appear humped back. I don't know if this was for effect or what but it got on my nerves. Many of the other Juliets have been beautiful and brought spark to their characters. Claire Danes looked like a boy with bad hair implants ( it was some sort of bad wig they gave her ) and squeals when she gets loud.Danes was not the best choice for Juliet. Someone more fitting would have been Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Drew Barrymore or Liv Tyler. All eccentric beauties who dive into characters time after time and impressed. Danes is just another one from the 90's teen scene who got her start on television and tried to transfer that onto the screen. Maybe she would have been better in something else ( though I've seen her in three films and she acts the same in all of them ). Juliet wasn't her thing. She wasn't convincing and there wasn't anything that would make Romeo see HER out of thousands of other beautiful girls and fall in love. Especially someone as handsome as Leo DiCaprio.<br />This used to be one of my favorite films but I've tired of it now. I barely watch it. It's a good movie if you can get past the terrible Juliet cast. The others do not disappoint. One good thing was that Danes wasn't shown that much. They could have devoted more air time to John Leguizamo. He's terrific whether he does comedy or serious roles.  Nice movie to add to your collection.
B000022TSW|5.0|I would just like to say that this movie, in the words of Cartman, kicks (censored).  This movie is just as funny as any Tom Green movie.  The kids sneak in to an R-rated movie, and it warps their fragile little minds.  They use several \\"flavorful\\" words (very creative), and the United States declares war on Canada. I won't spoil the end, but I'll tell you that, in Cartman's repetoire, there are references to several early episodes(especially \\"Chicken Lover\\" and \\"Mecha Streisand\\").  ...
B000053V7Q|3.0|This version of course contains great relics, any Presley footage is worth watching. But the original had moments that were special and have been cut. Such as the impersonators so desperately trying to sing tiger man and the cut to a Presley concert where he gives it the one and only signature. But the real mistake is cutting the stage version of &quot;Bridge over Troubled water&quot; probably the best version ever.<BR>All in all it is a decent piece of editing but I need the original.
B00008DDSC|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie in the theater when it came out. We were floored. It was amazing. I've read all 135 reviews posted on this wonderful movie and I was shocked to see how many just hated it. I found the quiet flow and growth of the characters refreshing. As for people saying the setting surreal, obviously have no clue on the flavor of S&amp;M and D/s.<br />While neither of us have the overt issues psychologically that the main characters seem to, we both related to them amazingly close. <br />This movie is about love and personal growth. The other stuff is just the mechanics to allow them both to happen.  We watch this movie together alot...its a wonderful love story with a twist.<br />Don't watch it for the S&amp;M...watch it for the amazing performances of the actors and the really nice story underneath.
0688163173|5.0|Until I read Shutter Island, I thought Mystic River was his best.  But Shutter Island wowed me.  The ending was brilliant, and as someone said earlier, I spent at least an hour re-reading parts of the book to pick up the hints and clues so I could say, \\"Aha\\".  I really have enjoyed all of his books, but Mystic River and Shutter Island have kicked it up several notches.
B0000B1OFN|4.0|Six men team up to pull off a complex heist in Venice, Italy. John (Donald Sutherland) is a veteran thief pulling off one last job. Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) is his protege at the helm of an operation for the first time. Kyle (Seth Green) is their computer guy. Left Ear (Mos Def) does explosives and demolition. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham)  is the wheel man responsible for the getaway. And Steve (Edward Norton)  infiltrates the target building. The object of their desire is a safe containing $35 million in gold bricks. The job goes as planned until Steve betrays his partners, leaves them for dead,  and makes off with the loot. A year later, back in the United States, Charlie has tracked Steve down and reassembled his team to take back the gold and exact revenge for John's murder. John's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), a safe expert who normally works on the right side of the law, joins them with vengence on her mind.<br /><br />Director F. Gary Gray has made an upbeat, funny and action-packed caper film. &#34;The Italian Job&#34; is light entertainment. The characters have just enough depth to bring them within the bounds of credibility and enough idiosyncrasies to make them entertaining. The film revolves around clever, complicated heists and spectacular chase scenes. Three souped up Mini Coopers and one vintage Mini are featured prominently. These little cars steal every scene they are in. &#34;The Italian Job&#34;'s stunts and chase sequences are not digitally enhanced. They were filmed the old fashioned way with lots of fancy driving and smashed cars, which gives them a sense of fun sometimes absent in modern action films. Sometimes I felt that too much time was spent on the antics of the obligatory colorful characters,which creates excessive lulls between substantive scenes. The movie tries desperately to make computer technology look interesting and sexy, which seems to be the (failed) mission of every action film these days. But &#34;The Italian Job&#34; is slick, fun, and energetic. It is only loosely based on the 1969 film of the same name. Recommended for a good time at the movies and to Mini Cooper aficionados everywhere.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a short &#34;making of&#34; documentary with interviews with director F. Gary Gray and  the film's cast (except Edward Norton), interviews with the film's writers, a segment about the driving training that the actors received, a segment about the film's specially designed Mini Coopers, explanations of the film's most spectacular stunts including the unprecedented chase scene in Venice's canals, some deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.

0671045865|3.0|\\"The world has teeth Tom and it can bite anytime it wants to.\\"  This quote is from Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and it is typical because the world is cruel and there is no telling what it might do.  King's purpose in writing this novel is mainly to keep the reader guessing about what will happen next.  King achieves this by using appealing settings, complex characters, suspenseful plots, and different language styles.<br /> This story centers around a nine year old girl named Trisha, who goes on a hiking trip with her mom and brother and gets lost.  She stays in the woods for over a week with little food and water.  Along the way, she encounters many dangerous and scary obstacles.  There is always something watching her in the woods, but what is it?  Will she be saved or will the \\"thing\\" get her?<br /> The main characters in this story are Trisha and Tom Gordon.  King portrays these characters in a very effective way.  Trisha is the girl who gets lost in the woods while on a hiking trail.  \\"I'm going to die in these woods.\\"  Trisha starts to think she actually will die in the woods after being lost in them for a while.  Trisha shows very strong character in this novel and seems more mature than most nine year olds.  Tom Gordon is Trisha's favorite major league baseball player and he plays for the Red Sox.  \\"Tom, look!\\"  \\"Look at the water!\\"  Tom is never really in the woods with Trisha, but his spirit and her faith in him help her get through many struggles.<br /> \\"These woods scare me.\\"  The main setting in this novel is in the woods.  These woods are loaded with swamps, marshes, and wild animals.  \\"If this stream goes into another swamp, I'll kill myself,\\" Trisha said.  Every time Trisha finds a stream of water, it flows into a swamp.  Will she ever find a road or a stream of water that does not lead into a swamp?<br /> The plot of this novel is Trisha being lost in the woods and trying to survive.  \\"Nothing's watching me in these woods.\\"  \\"Oh my God, those are claw-marks,\\" Trisha said.  There is always something watching Trisha's every move in the woods, but what is it?  Read the book to find out what happens to Trisha.<br /> King uses 3rd person point of view in most of this novel.  \\"I'll never talk about this, never,\\" she said.  This novel includes many obscenities and isn't recommended for young readers.  King writes this book in an informal writing style.<br /> This novel is very suspenseful and keeps the reader guessing.  It receives three stars from me because it is an overall good book.  \\"Sooner or later, you'll have to deal with the \\"thing\\" to get it to leave you alone.\\"  So go read this book and find out if Trisha makes it out of the woods alive or not.  Remember, the woods are real and when visiting them on a vacation, bring a compass, good maps, and try to stay on the path.se are claw-marks,\\" Trisha said.

B000059XVS|5.0|It's like that quote from \\"Sunset Boulvard\\".  It's the screen that got smaller.  Really, there is no point in buying this DVD.  You must watch this film in cinema.  So I should perhaps rate the film five-star, but the product no-star.<br />The story, unavoidably, takes some license with the historical facts, but that is not really the point.  You can see from the film that Lean, O'Tool and all others in the production fell in love with the desert.  As Lawrence fought his way in the story, the production was fighting its way through the desert.  When both reached its final destination, Damascus for Lawrence and post-production for the cast and crew, it was hollow homecoming for both.<br />Watch this in cinema and know that when people say \\"They don't make films like they used to.\\" they have this one in mind.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It appears that once again Linkin Park has done it. Creating a awesome CD that we can all love. Mike Shinoda's lyrics in every song he sings in, (whether they be rap or flowing)is sensational, and Chester benningtons screaming choruses compliment them beautifully. The rest of the band's performance, whether it is joseph hahn's DJ work, or rob's drumwork is great. these are the ratings i gave each song based on pure tune, rhythms, lyrics, etc.<br /> foreword: a decent 13 second beat not much to say here. <br /> dont stay: a bit disappointed in this one, i didnt really like the tune here, and the lack of mikes rapping sort of brings this song's rating down. An ok song, but there are better in here. (4.5/10)<br /> somewhere i belong: a great song with just the right mix of mike and chester. The beginning is great and very catchy. (8.5/10)<br /> lying from you: one of my favorites on the album. the chorus is great and the tune is amazing and the lyrics are intense, great work LP!! (9.5/10)<br /> hit the floor: contrary to popular belief, this is actually a really good song, and chester's screaming hook in the chorus works! (8.0/10)<br /> easier to run: another slice of LP magic here, with great vocals by both mike and chester. the chorus is slow, yet tasteful, and the ending cant be beat. (10/10)<br /> faint: very, verrrry good song,the verses are great, and the chorus is fast and furious. i dont know how they do it! (10/10)<br /> figure.09:......not good.....not terribe.....enough said. (5.0/10)<br /> breaking the habit: a good break from the rest of the cd, with no hardcore guitar and chester singing softly. very good, and thats even with the fact that mike doesnt sing! (8.5/10)<br />from the inside: im sort of torn of how to rate this song, i like the first 2 minutes, but the last minute wasnt to my taste. its a good song (7.5/10)<br /> nobodys listening: a really awesome song, the chinese flute may seem of at first, but as you listen to it more, you'll wonder how they ever got along without it. (9.0/10)<br /> session: a very strange song, with eerie sounds and a kooky beat that takes some getting used to, but its a decent song. (7.0/10)<br /> numb: a great song, i dont have a clue why its at the end of the album, and mikes sole line in the song is a very memorable one. (9.0/10)<br />    Overall an awesome CD. If you are a Linkin park fan, even if youre not, and you dont own this, than youre mad!!!

B000067CPX|4.0|its really amazing that that the peepers can still stay fresh and great sounding after over 10 years of existing. even their last album, Californication shows that these peepers still taste good, and By The Way is no exception. Anthony, Flea, Chad, and the other guitarist (i cant remember his name), all give stunning performances in ALMOST every song and as a result this is up their with their best CDs<br /> By The Way: One of their best songs since, Around the world, a rare display of some real rock that made the band famous. I especially like Anthony's rap verse style. (10/10)<br /> Universally Speaking: a good song, with some nice touches and a bouncy beat, mainly let down by the fact that they repeat the same two verses over and over again. (7.5/10)<br /> This Is The Place: one of my favorites on the album, with a dark tune and great lyrics. the only swear word in the album is in this song, and that verse is very fast. Great. (10/10)<br /> Dosed: somewhat of a depressing song that might appeal to teenage girls. pfft, \\"take it away and everything will be okay\\". (3.5/10)<br /> Dont Forget Me: a great pick up after \\"Dosed\\" with a slightly darker tune and Anthony having an echoing voice. Great guitar, great lyrics. 9.5/10<br /> The Zephyr Song: hmmm, a split mark. love the verses and the guitar, but hated the chorus, too sentimental. the ending guitar is really good though. (8.0/10)<br /> Can't Stop: Aaaaahhhh, a really fantastic song, with a bouncy tune, and a great chorus, the ending tune is really catchy. (9.0/10)<br /> I Could Die For You: despite a verrrry slow beat and tune, this is actually a very good song. with sincere and tasteful lyrics, its a decent song. (8.0/10)<br /> Midnight: a really good song....after the beginning, which, with all those stupid kooky sounds, is really annoying.otherwise, you have a great song here. (8.5/10) <br /> Throw Away Your Television: a really cool song with cool sounds and great connecting lyrics. also the chorus is one ofthe best choruses on the CD. hope you enjoy this one, as it starts to go downhill from here. (9.0/10)<br /> Cabron: ick....i knew there would be some spanish here, the verses are annoying, as well as the chorus, which is extremely repetitive. (4.5/10)<br /> Tear: kind of an annoying song, with a weird beat, and sappy lyrics. next. (5.0/10)<br /> On Mercury: More spanish......need i say more? (5.5/10)<br /> Minor Thing: At least they have one decent song after number ten. nice lyrics, good tune and a grrrreat beat. one of the better ones here. (8.0/10)<br /> Warm Tape: Contrary to popular belief, this is NOT a good song, annoying lyrics, and the guitar is average at best. an ok song, but you should be able to find better (6.0/10)<br /> Venice Queen: I'd prefer a more of a harder rock song to close the CD, but this is the song they've chosen, and its ok, i guess. (6.5/10)<br />  A breath of fresh air to re-open the peppers, a great purchase.<br /> why you should by it: songs, \\"this is the place\\", \\"dont forget me\\", and \\"by the way\\". great lyrics, and grat guitar, Anthony at his very best, it doesnt get much better! the first ten songs are great (with the exception of \\"dosed\\"<br /> why you shouldnt by it: five of the last six songs are pretty bad, and some of simulated sounds are pretty annoying. songs \\"cabron\\" and \\"on mercury
B000089RVR|5.0|I too was skeptical that Dido could equal her debut with this release.  How wrong I was.  Life For Rent is terrific.

Everybody has different tastes, but you don't have to go on and on berating others who DO like Dido's music.  To each their own - please don't make a never-ending federal case of it.  Best wishes to ALL.
B000092ZYX|5.0|If I tried my hardest to put into words the emotional impact the album has had in my life, I wouldn't be able to.  From political metaphors to dealing with rejection and fear, this album covers it all.  It derives from the prog rock-ish style from the Bends and Ok Computer, and mixes it with the electronic sounds from Kid A and Amnesiac. To give a taste of a few of my favorites:<br />2+2=5 -  A phenomenal track which gets alot of meaning from the book 1984, and compares our government to a totalitarian government.<br />The Gloaming- I can't put this into words.  This track is remarkable.  It's almost a warning building up to the end of something.<br />I Will-  A somewhat short track, but it says alot.  Comparable to Like Spinning Plates or Pyramid Song. &quot;Meet the real word coming out of my shell&quot;<br />Wolf at the Door-  Lets just call this a sequel to Street Spirit.  This is the climax of the album, and fitting to be the last track. It deals with the fear of rejection, and fear in general.  All the emotion, fear, and sadness that builds up in you during this song seems to be immediately healed at the end when Thom tells you  &quot;I wish you'd get up go over get up go over and turn this tape off&quot;.  Its worth buying the CD just for this one song.<br />Overall this CD is outstanding, and while I can't say its necessarily better than the other Radiohead CDs, because all Radiohead CDs are an experience and not just a CD, it is definetily worth buying and anybody who doesn't buy this CD is missing out on a life changing experience.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|On the allmusic.com website, this album was likened to capturing the sound that &quot;Heroes&quot; through Scary Monsters explored between '77 and 1980; Heathen was apprently the rekindling of music between Hunky Dory and Low.  I really fail to see that connection.  While I understand that Bowie was more melodically-minded on Heathen - I think motivated and anchored by what seemed to be a need to prove himself as an energetic and tight songwriter - and thus may have appealed to a more Ziggy-minded, glammy audience, I think he was aiming to convey a certain peacefulness (or even softness).  His early '70s works, I would argue, don't take that road.  They don't really try.  Reality does, however, speak of the sonic raucous that Bowie was flexing within Heroes (especially tracks 1,2,4,5), parts of Lodger (tracks 3,9), and Scary Monsters (tracks 1,3,6,7,8).  There's a more treble-oriented scraping in the foreground with a lot of tracks on Reality, which at times struck me as a kind of purposeful distraction from some of the smoother undertones.  His singing, while more appealing and adventurous on Heathen, is no less impressive (outstanding on &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;, &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot;, &quot;Reality&quot;, and the highlight &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot;), as he hits dead on all the right notes (and perfectly lands the wrong ones- something I've always admired about his singing).<BR>Absolutely worth buying, this album is good for much exploration on the listener's part.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Rita Hayworth went down in Hollywood history as the Love Goddess.  Her title role in *Gilda* (Columbia Pictures, 1946) leaves no doubt why.  Yet here she is much more than a sex symbol. For one thing, Rita was a seriously talented actress.  For another, she was one of the best dancers in films.  To this day her performance in *Gilda* remains unrivaled as a combo of talent, sensuality, sensitivity, and sheer drop-dead pulchritude.  Columbia's catchy ad-phrase for the film was, &quot;There never was a woman like Gilda.&quot;  You'd better believe it. Glenn Ford perfectly fills out the character of Johnny Farrel, the young gambler who hates to love femme fatale Gilda.  In return, Gilda loves to hate Johnny.  George MacReady offers an outstanding performance as murderous Ballin Mundson, the man Gilda fears.<br />If you like movies that challenge the viewer to figure out hidden meanings, then *Gilda* is for you.  &quot;Maybe that stands for something,&quot; Rita-as-Gilda says near the beginning; &quot;Maybe that means something,&quot; she says near the end.  Halfway through she says, &quot;Any psychiatrist would say that means something.&quot; The question of interpretation hangs over the entire film, loaded as it is with symbolism and double-entendres.<br />On the other hand, you can ignore the subtext and enjoy *Gilda* as a noirish romantic mystery-thriller.  It's a beautiful flick to look at in black and white, and it's never boring, even all the decades since it was made.  Some reviewers say the plot is difficult to follow.  I don't agree; the story is both logical and economical.  But that may be because I understand *Gilda* to be a dramatized introduction to the psychological concepts of C.G. Jung.  Never mind.  If you like your movies to be just movies, *Gilda* tastefully blends ingredients from *Casablanca*, *The Maltese Falcon*, *Notorious* and *The Big Sleep*, then stirs in its own original sauce.  In my opinion, it's an improvement upon those classics, as fine as they are by themselves.<br />I wouldn't call *Gilda* a true film noir, for the reason that at the end the male and female leads are triumphant instead of tormented.  Great films of the 1940s that had real &quot;noir&quot; (black) denouements are *Criss Cross*, *Detour*, *Double Indemnity*, *Scarlet Street*, *The Killers* and *The Postman Always Rings Twice*.  Still, on their way to a happy ending Johnny and Gilda pass through a landscape that is darker and more suggestive of spiritual abandonment than most '40s film noirs dared explore.  At the same time, because of the intense chemistry between the leads, *Gilda* sizzles hotter than any film of that period I can think of.<br />Love the music too.  Five stars.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.ne as they are by themselves.  <br />I wouldn't call *Gilda* a true film noir, for the reason that at the end the male and female leads are triumphant instead of tormented.

B000023VR6|5.0|Once again Dre proved why he is the man. This album is packed with hot tracks top to bottom. Instant classic.
B000084T18|1.0|I never actually bought this cd but i dont need to.  Why don't i need to, because 50 cent sucks.  He can't rap,all he does is mumble,and the only reason people like him is because he was produced by eminem.  Most people who listen to 50 are pre-pubescent girls that the like the songs because of the beats.Why dont people listen to good rappers like King Gordy and Esham.  So in conclusion 50 cent sucks.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is the best rap album ever by far.
0345448898|5.0|This book takes you on a wonderful journey through worlds so rich and fantastical that you will wish they really existed. The characters are very developed and they will become your instant friends. There are awesome twists and turns that will keep you up all night reading. I highly and thoroughly recommend these books to anyone with a pulse!
B00006690G|5.0|Great album. The first two albums are definatly better, but its still one of the best albums ever made. The only track I didn't like was When the Music Stops, that song didnt impress me, other than that, the album is a classic
B000002GK1|5.0|Most people will tell you that 'Superunknown' is the best Soundgarden record.  I can't help but disagree.  While 'Superunknown' was an amazing album, 'Badmotorfinger' eats it alive.  From the punky opener 'Rusty Cage' to the sludgey 'New Damage', 'Badmotorfinger' hits you like a ton of bricks and won't quit.  It's definately not for the weak at heart.  It's nowhere near as poppy as their later offerings, but the transition is there with songs like 'Mind Riot' and 'Room A Thousand Years Wide'.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this album!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. Every single track on this album is amazing. His lyrics are untouchable. I am a hard guy to impress, but this album blew me away.
0694013889|5.0|I purchased this book a few months ago and when my husband read it to our daughter (2yrs. old) for the first time, he asked me what made me purchase a book like this!?  The wording was direct and to the point.  Our daughter thought it was funny.  Well we put it on the shelf for some time and then reintroduced it to my daughter a few months later.  Now, SHE LOVES THIS BOOK!  Every, single, night she begs for the \\"Potty Book!\\" This book has motivated my daughter to go to the potty more often.  She knows this book so well she can finish the sentences herself!
B000084T18|5.0|Great ablum with many hot tracks. His lyrics need some work, but the album is everything I expected and more.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This was a blind buy for me based on all the hype of this cd. I have listened to it about a dozen times from start to finish. It's not like I don't like mellow music, but this cd is painful to listen to. I guess I'll never be *cool* like you guys.
0790730960|4.0|This is my second review for this movie.Orginally,I really hated this movie(read my first review to find out why)but it has really gotten better.I still think it is the weakest of the four but when you look past its flaws,it becomes way more enjoyable.See this if you are a Batman or Tim Burton fan.Ignore my other review for this movie
B000001EUP|3.0|You can really do alright with the greatest hits packages, seeing as how all the strongest tracks (\\"Blackout\\" \\"No One Like You\\" \\"You Give Me All I Need\\") are already on BEST OF ROCKERS n' BALLADS, and \\"China White\\" and \\"Dynamite\\" appear on the double disc DEADLY STING. Then there is the new millenium's VERY BEST OF and by then, you pretty much have the best of this album all available elsewhere.<br />No doubt a good album, but being only a passing Scorps fan, and only really a fan of thier \\"heavy 80s/early 90s, I'll stick to the hits. You may want to as well. Save your money folks, we aren't all rich. I recommend CRAZY WORLD compared to this. <br />As for the music on here, it is the begenning of the Scorps golden metal years, with \\"No One Like You\\" being my ultimate favourite from this CD. \\"When the Smoke is Going Down\\" has some great guitar lines but the song itself just doesn't come across well. Really every song here is good but just misses the mark somehow, coming only close to being a really great tune. \\"Arizona\\" is catchy and sports a heavy groove that fit well together too. <br />Check it out based on your own tastes, everyone is different, and everyone prefers a different time in the Scorps long, long career. 5/9
B000002VCB|2.0|As an avid APP fan, I was rather disappointed with the quality of this album.   The lyrics fit very well in the theme of the album but the music sounds extremely amateurish.   I know at the time that AP had a contract with Arista records to release three albums in a short period of time...and that there was another album &quot;Sicilian Defense&quot; that was so bad that Arista kept it in their vaults and vowed never to release it...and true to their word, that's exactly what they did. Eve was one of those three quick albums, Pyramid and Turn of a Friendly Card,which were fabulous albums, were the other two.  Eve was rushed, the musicianship very amateurish and overall the album left this APP fan very unimpressed.<br />Lucifer was a great instrumental....but outside of that and If I Could Change Your Mind, the music here is not of great quality.   If I were to introduce someone to APP, I would not play this album...in fact, this would be the LAST album I would allow them to hear.
B000069CWE|5.0|I'll have to say that, many people were disapointed with this release. I for one was not, since i knew what i waws expecting. After all it is a REMIX CD! So you shouldn't expect any new tracks. As for Reanimation, a combination of Hybrid Theory &amp; Hybrid Theory LP (the mini album released prior to Hybrid Theory), a few of the remixes acutally kill the originals:<br />Notable Tracks:<BR>-Pts Of Athrty: Probably better than the original<BR>-Enth E Nd: some may argue that it isn't that good<BR>-Frgt 10: An excellent remix; love that tune<BR>-P5hng Me A Wy: just as good as the original, is that chester's voice in the later verse?<BR>-H Vltg3: Another cool track, better than the original.<BR>-Riff Raff: the wordless mix by Mr Hahn is not breathtaking, but not bad either<BR>-Ppr Kut: not as good as the original, but still outstanding<BR>-By_myslf: i like the original version, but this OK.<br />The opening track isn't bad either...
0790731002|2.0|Batman Return was a far better movie than Batman Forever Batman forever was like watching a two hour cartoon show val Kilmer was okay as batman but Jim carrey was good as the riddle but tommy lee jones sucks as two face best part of the movie was The showdown Between Batman, The riddler so rent this okaymovie but Batman Forever is a better movie Than Batman and Robin Batman and Robin sucks i hpoe tthe new Batman movie is going to be good
B00006BTCA|5.0|Yes, this album is worth every one of the 5 stars that I gave it.  It has a dark, moody atmosphere that is introspective and brillant.  This is easily the best album of this genre that I have heard in a long time.  Joy Division references are very evident and if you disagree then you don't know Joy Division very well.  I will sum it up by saying if you like dark early to mid eighties rock you will love this album.  They have a very UK feel to them even though they are from this side of the Atlantic.
B00007E8V4|1.0|I can't even try to take this band seriously, they sound really stupid, and now try to sound like Bill Maher with instruments, If you like cds that suck, buy this. By the way, Boom is the gayest song ever created, instead of stealing this album, burn it to hell with other crappy cds.
B00005JM09|2.0|Its another plottless movie, bad guys chases good guy, they fight and someone wins. Special effcts do rock in this movie.<BR>I hate to say this, but everyone dies at the end. The killer is really Elmo from Seasme Street. He traveled through time to kill everyone so big bird and burt & ernie could run the mob. awesome<BR>special effects.  I would say \\"a must see movie.\\"
B000002GF8|5.0|Sting may have written the hits, but the sound is pure collective Police.  Rarely has an album classified under &quot;punk-rock&quot; shown such pure artistry in lyricism and uniqueness of musical arrangement.<br />The arrangments are actually very simple, with several songs towering in grandeur for their simplicity and energy.<br />What made the Police such a formidable band was the collection of powerful individual forces, who contribute their own indelible signature to the over-all sound.  While this made for a powderkeg of egos, it also made the band very very potent.<br />It's a shame this was the last studio album of the Police.. But then again, part of their immortality is built on the fact that they bowed offstage in the absolute peak of their success.
6303418287|5.0|I was stunned to learn that this film was a box-office failure, and that so many people had panned it. I loved this film.<br />To say it's a departure from the Boris Karloff film is to state an extremely obvious fact.  That film was designed to shock; one can simply not empathize with the Creature. This film, as excellent films always seem to do, operates on several levels.  There is the utter horror of the creation, and the result of defying nature.  But there is also the desire not to let go of someone after death, to keep them, to not loose them, in violation of the natural order of things.<br />There is also the tension that is created by a wife who does not understand the important work of the husband, thinking that trivia transcends matters of life and death.  There is also the scars that utter rejection has on the human pysche...the Creature wants to be accepted as we all do;  when he is rejected and reviled, he goes mad.<br />What's not to like in this film?  I guess if you were expecting shock/schlock, then this intelligent appraisal of the subject would be a disappointment, otherwise, buy and enjoy this film!
B0000C7PSW|4.0|The quality in this music is what is missing in all the Micki-Dee's music we are forced to listen to everyday weather we want to or not.<br />Although this isn't my favorite Rufus album, there is something very special about it. In 20 years when people rediscover him, this will be his defining album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle's first album was a musical masterpiece which stood out among rock albums of it's time with riffs and lyrics spanning music of all ages.  Thirteenth Step took this element, added a darkness to the amazing guitar parts and Keenan's incredible talent for writing songs to make what I personally feel is THE BEST album I have listened to in my life.  Definately worth the price, plus some.
B00006879E|5.0|I absolutely adore Maroon5! I have seen them twice live and both times I have been blown away. I recommend this album to anyone who is longing for great rock music with a special twist,a funky R&amp;B undertone.  Buy this album, support this wonderful band, I swear you will not be disappointed!
B00005JKC3|5.0|I don't know what other movie theater everybody else too, but I had a blast with the Hulk Movie. I admit it's a little slow at the beginning, but once Bruce turned into the Hulk, I was hooked. The special effects are a nice touch and the sound was perfect. By the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat, wanting to see if there was more. I recommend this movie to everyone!
B00005R2M3|2.0|Don't get me wrong, Shakira is a great artist who is a shining example of what the music of Columbia is about.  Like Gloria Estefan is a shining example for Cubans, the late-great Selena for Mexicans, J. Lo for Puerto Ricans, Shakira is definitely a shining representation of Columbia.  However, Shakira is one of those artists who simply does not transcends well into English.  Her weak development in the language clearly shines through when she sings.  Basically, her music sounds forced in English.  I love her Spanish music and &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; and &quot;Ojos Asi,&quot; for example, is a great representation of her Columbian-cross-Lebanese cultures.  To help get her English crossover, the Queen of Latin pop herself, Gloria Estefan, came in to write the lyrics to &quot;Whenever, Wherever,&quot; which was Shakira's only big hit from LAUNDRY SERVICE.  Again, her music is great, but in Spanish.  However, when it comes to English, can you honestly understand what she is saying?  She's like a Latin Macy Gray...someone who shouldn't sing.  Shakira, por favor, stick to your rock en espanol!  Remember, there is only one crossover queen and that is Miss Estefan.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Just saw this on the big screen (on what would have been John Lennon's 63rd birthay), and will be adding it to my collection when the DVD is released.<br />What a heartwarming display of the love George created in his too-short lifetime!  He probably would have been horribly embarrassed had he still been with us in physical form, but for everyone in Albert Hall that night one year on, not to mention the rest of us who can see it now, it was healing celebration of the life that touched countless others with the  beautiful music he gave us.<br />Anyone who loved the BEATLES won't want to miss this one!
0671045865|3.0|\\"The world has teeth Tom and it can bite anytime it wants to.\\"  This quote is from Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and it is typical because the world is cruel and there is no telling what it might do.  King's purpose in writing this novel is mainly to keep the reader guessing about what will happen next.  King achieves this by using appealing settings, complex characters, suspenseful plots, and different language styles.<br /> This story centers around a nine year old girl named Trisha, who goes on a hiking trip with her mom and brother and gets lost.  She stays in the woods for over a week with little food and water.  Along the way, she encounters many dangerous and scary obstacles.  There is always something watching her in the woods, but what is it?  Will she be saved or will the \\"thing\\" get her?<br /> The main characters in this story are Trisha and Tom Gordon.  King portrays these characters in a very effective way.  Trisha is the girl who gets lost in the woods while on a hiking trail.  \\"I'm going to die in these woods.\\"  Trisha starts to think she actually will die in the woods after being lost in them for a while.  Trisha shows very strong character in this novel and seems more mature than most nine year olds.  Tom Gordon is Trisha's favorite major league baseball player and he plays for the Red Sox.  \\"Tom, look!\\"  \\"Look at the water!\\"  Tom is never really in the woods with Trisha, but his spirit and her faith in him help her get through many struggles.<br /> \\"These woods scare me.\\"  The main setting in this novel is in the woods.  These woods are loaded with swamps, marshes, and wild animals.  \\"If this stream goes into another swamp, I'll kill myself,\\" Trisha said.  Every time Trisha finds a stream of water, it flows into a swamp.  Will she ever find a road or a stream of water that does not lead into a swamp?<br /> The plot of this novel is Trisha being lost in the woods and trying to survive.  \\"Nothing's watching me in these woods.\\"  \\"Oh my God, those are claw-marks,\\" Trisha said.  There is always something watching Trisha's every move in the woods, but what is it?  Read the book to find out what happens to Trisha.<br /> King uses 3rd person point of view in most of this novel.  \\"I'll never talk about this, never,\\" she said.  This novel includes many obscenities and isn't recommended for young readers.  King writes this book in an informal writing style.<br /> This novel is very suspenseful and keeps the reader guessing.  It receives three stars from me because it is an overall good book.  \\"Sooner or later, you'll have to deal with the \\"thing\\" to get it to leave you alone.\\"  So go read this book and find out if Trisha makes it out of the woods alive or not.

B00006RCNJ|3.0|Although I enjoyed the DVD, I discovered that Amazons' listing of the songs on this DVD are in error.  None of the selections listed are correct.  Therefore, I was disappointed, as I did not get what I thought I was ordering.
0385504209|1.0|This book had definate potential in the first 10 chapters, which made me all the more frustrated when, by page 325, I realized the ridiulous route it began following by page 225 was not going to change.  I am not a historian, but I enjoy history, and have a personal interest in the Knights Templar.  The historical mistakes the author made concerning the noble Temple Knights were legion- so many serious errors that I cannot help but feel he took real events and twisted them to conform to a contrived plot that served his own literary interests.  With this realization, I began to question his professional integrity, given his claims to accuracy that he made in the opening intro.<br />The many &quot;clues&quot; which guide the characters through a laberynthine maze of intrigue become tedious and never ending, and ultimately one gets the &quot;answers&quot; long after they have stopped caring about the &quot;questions&quot;.  Sometimes, the clues are just ridiculous: &quot;Eros is an anagram for Rose,&quot; points out one character, suggesting a deliberate historical significance in the etymology of the word; except they come from two different languages separated by several centuries.  In one chapter, there is a sample writing that the cryptologists cannot decipher.  One comments that it looked Hebraic.  It looked nothing like Hebrew- and I would expect a linguist to know this.<br />This said, I found the plot ultimately pressing a point that was inconsistent, pushing a feminine goddess agenda while seemingly denying a male god:<br />Jesus was a mere mortal man, his divinity contrived by the political motives of Constantine; but Magdalene, his wife, was a goddess, worshipped and revered by a secret fertility based religion with sex-rituals, which seemed to be portrayed as normal (only abnormal to modern society because an oppressive, patriarchal based faith condemned free sexual expression).  I never understood why Jesus was mortal, but Magdalene was divine.  And I could not help but feel this point, pounded repeatedly, was ridulously represented in the main female character, who seemed to take everything, no matter how ridiculous, at face value, because the main male character said so.ld not help but feel this point, pounded repeatedly, was ridulously represented in the main female character, who seemed to take everything, no matter how ridiculous, at face value, because the main male character said so.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I got hooked into buying this cd because I just fell in love with the little pieces of &quot;Follow Through&quot; that were being played to promote the new Jerry Bruckheimer series, &quot;Skin&quot;.  Even though I am always hesitant of buying a cd for one song, I am ever so glad that I did.  Gavin Degraw is about to explode onto the musical forefront and rightfully so.  This is what I have been missing in the newer John Mayer music.
0780624890|3.0|Based on the Marvel comic character of the same name, Blade is a vampire hunter who himself was born to a mother who was bitten by a vampire.  Blade staves off becoming a bloodsucker himself through home-grown drug injections.  Unlike other Vamps, Blade can travel by day and has all the strengh and speed of other vampires.<br />The plot is bit of drivel about Vampires trying to read and decode some ancient text about taking over the world or some such nonsense.  Filmakers always seem to go a bit overboard needlessly on their plotting...<br />Blade is an exciting movie.  Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as the no nonsense butt-kicking hero, who slices and dices his way through scores of vamps.<br />In particular, the opening moments in the nightclub is fantastic as vampires are dusted at an extraordinary rate.<br />I wasn't crazy about Steven Dorff as the villian however.  He just seem ill-suited to the role.  A little too pretty boy for my tastes.<br />The movie did well enough to spawn a sequel and I hear a third will be made as well.  A fun entertainment piece but not too deep.

Some arguing is okay, but it must be lighthearted.  Neither of them should come across as wounded or broken people.  They should be whole and strong individually, and even better when they are together.<br />\\"French Kiss\\" delivers all of that.  It is one of my very favorite romantic comedies, coming in just behind \\"Roxanne\\" and, at the top of the heap, \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\"  Kate (Meg Ryan) is a whole person who knows what she wants, as is Luc (Kevin Kline).  They share a common problem in that they both misunderstand how to best go about achieving their goals.  They come together into a force to be reckoned with.  Timothy Hutton and Jean Reno round out the cast with spot-on performances.  Laurent Spielvogel as the concierge steals every scene he is in.<br />This movie has many splendid romantic moments.  The first kiss that Kate and Luc share is one of the finest screen kisses I've ever seen filmed.  It just makes you ache to be kissed like that.  \\"French Kiss\\" also provides some wonderful comedic moments.  When Kate describes for Luc a future in which he allows old resentments to fester and spends his days sitting and twitching, it makes me laugh every time.  As with most films, there are some low points.  I don't care much for broad comedy, so the collision with the dessert tray and the \\"lactose intolerance\\" scenes don't do much for me.  But for the most part, this is a fun film well worth watching.<br />I regret that I can give no insights as to the quality of the DVD or the special features included therein (although the description makes it sound like the special features are a little thin).  I enjoyed this film so well that I bought the widescreen edition on laserdisc many years back and have seen it only in that format.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|This is the begining of a new age for Enigma<br />The CD contains teh best electronic music i ever heard.<BR>no more chants, but it is still great. innovation was necessary for Enigma.<BR>the old Enigma is gone, but it is still the Best<br />Enigma Est Mort, Vive Enigma!!!
B000060P79|1.0|I will be the first to admit, I am not a big fan of punk music. I am more interested in rap and classic rock, like Jimi Hendrix or Outkast. But I know that when skater-punk first became big with the help of bands like Blin-182 or Green Day, it did seem quite revolutionary. But then comes Sum-41, Good Charlotte, and now Simple Plan. By now, skater-punk is being way overused. I am tired of the genre, with the same depressed/happy/I must have weed and a girlfriend NOW beats and rhythyms. I have heard enough of the guys getting dumped and scraping their knees on the pavement garbage that skater-punk has become. And Simple Plan is not the only bad rock band out there. Whoever thought that Good Charlotte would be a good band was sadly and seriously very wrong. I've heard enough about Benji and Joel and all their suicidal girl followers. And about Simple Plan and Avril Lavigne, these retards are Canadien?!?! WTF! Are Canadiens becoming like heavy skaters now, because it wasn't really that way a couple of years ago. Whatever the case is. don't buy any more Simple Plan or Good Charlotte or Simple Plan and Good Charlotte followers' albums! It's not worth it, and right about now, I'm off to listen to OutKast, 50 Cent, or Jimi Hendrix, not skater-pop. Trust me on this one!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I just do not understand why are people complaining about this new Cretu project. The album contains no samples but all original work by Cretu and I feel Enigma project is evolving in right direction ever since Enigma 3. The artist evolves, and so should listener with them as well. This is the most original piece of music I have heard lately. I welcome all of the changes in sound and embrace remixes of Voyageur as well. And to all of those who complain I just want to say that Michael Cretu is not traditional new age world fusion artist and I just do not want another copy of Enigma 1 or Enigma 2, like some of past reviews explained; I want new sounds and new direction and something original that only Cretu could come up with, and that is what Voyageur is all about. Album is plain amazing.
0385504209|3.0|For a simple two-day read, Dan Brown can't be beat: his writing is simple and carries the plot along at a good pace, uninterrupted by long tangents or paragraphs you must read over a few times to get the hang of.<br />However, The Da Vinci Code only gets away with this because the writing is mediocre, entirely lacking in description. All of the characters, including the protagonists, are not only stock, but entirely static. Langdon, the run-of-the-mill handsome genius; Sophie, the run-of-the-mill gorgeous genius with, as always, long legs. There is, of course, a secret romance going on that has its silly climax somewhere around the last page. The characters are as flat, maybe even more flat, than those in Tom Clancy novels.<br />The plot is very basic; it's about as linear as a sharp edge. There are no unpredictable twists in the story, as the first sentence describing any suspicious characters were drawn out of the Obviously Sinister Character Box. The plot and its characters are so trite that it's clear that the only reason they're there is as a method of dragging the reader through the superficial character development and car rides and into the only gem of the book: The Priori.<br />Reading any of Brown's books and you will discover that the best parts are in the brain-candy conspiracies (Illuminati in Angels &amp; Demons, NRO in Deception Point, and NSA in Digital Fortress) and developing technologies. All of these elements are researched and described simply and without too much effort for the reader. Nothing may be as intellectually thrilling as discovering the dark and hidden conspiracies that help shape the world. The Priori is no different, and the symbolism brought forth in Da Vinci's works is stunning.<br />If anything, The Da Vinci Code is a quick read with good brain-candy that gets your mind thinking. In the interim, you'll find the characters are cardboard and unchanging, and the plot far too obvious.
B00007G207|5.0|I was able to see the extended version a few years ago. I paid dearly for a VHS copy from Ebay. As much as I loved and enjoyed viewing the original, I wanted to see the extra footage, primarily to find out what happened to Elena. During the end credits of the original version, there were two quick shots of an adult &quot;Toto&quot; and &quot;Elena&quot;. That meant there was more to the film.<br />Having seen the extra scenes, I feel, like many of you, that the story had changed. The original theme or point, which to me always has been, the love of the cinema and movies was now regulated to the background. This change didn't diminish my love for the film, but I feel the sweetness, the innocence, the spirit of the first version was lessened. Like so many have said before me, the extra sex scenes were completely unneccessary, as were the scenes of Toto visiting with his sister's family. But a few others added to the story. The scene where Alfredo mentions having a another wife and child die in childbirth added to his sad state. It only reinforces his quote that he was a slave to the cinema. He probably loved the movies as much as Toto did, but he was not rewarded. He suffered losses, both emotional and physical.<br />The added scenes at the end where Toto finally learns what happened to Elena and that they are able to meet are a good closure to their story, though I did feel the scenes were longer than needed to be. I liked knowing Toto finally finds his Elena again, but I would have been content in seeing that he learn she always loved him and ended it at that. Like another viewer said, it is the soldier and princess story. They were never meant to be together. If should have been enough for Toto to know, Elena loved him so he could move on and not let her loss haunt him anymore.<br />As for the scene where we learn it is Alfredo who asks Elena to let Toto go, I am unsure whether this added to the film or altered it. I will say it does add a bit to the story which isToto's love for the movies. I have read many other viewers comments saying the film is about the love between Toto and Alfredo, or between relations and how they affect your lives. I agree in part, but I feel this film centers on Toto's one true passion, his love for movies.<br />We see it early on before he even starts to develop his unique and special friendship with Alfredo or before Elena enters the picture. Toto's main love affair has always been with movies. The relationships he developed with Alfredo and Elena only added to this. Toto felt strong ties to his family, to Alfredo, to Elena, to the cinema paradiso, and to his little village. But they are only a part of what made him the man he is. The driving force has always been his desire to do what he always loved, making movies. Alfredo knew this, that is why he felt it neccessary to end the relationship between Toto and Elena. His mother knew this, that is why she wished him love and good fortune when he left for Rome, knowing it was right. Elena knew this, that is why she left the cinema before Toto could return. Although leaving the note was her was of saying, &quot;Yes, I do love you.&quot;<br />A curious scene in both versions always stuck with me.  When an adult Toto returns for Alfredo's funeral, there is a scene between him and his mother when he tells her, he feels as though he abandoned her. I felt it was just the opposite, that he was the one who felt abandoned. When he left for Rome as a young man, he found success, but he was alone. He did not have the comfort of his mother's love, of Alfredo's love and guidance near him, nor the sense of belonging, the familiarity of his village. That sense of loss, or abandonment shadowed his life. He still fulfilled his dreams but he wasn't happy. He forgot how much the movies meant to him. He wallowed instead in the loss of Elena and how he never set foot in his childhood home for 30 years. I feel it was Alfredo's parting gift, the film of Kisses, that reminded him how much he truly loved the movies. He just needed someone to remind him.<br />The scene where the Cinema is destroyed is dramatic and poignant in the way that it shows the passing of time in the real world and Toto's life. Keeping away from his old town preserved the place and the people there to the same time as when he left. To him, the town remained as he wanted to remember them. But seeing that it did change, that everyone grew older, and that the Cinema had to go because it had no place in this new day was the cross over into reality which he had not wanted to see in 30 years. He felt abandoned because it all changed without him. But he had Alfredo's gift and it was the way he could remember it. With all the passion each kiss gave, and the power to move him to tears.
B00003CXB4|2.0|The songs in the original movie were NOT included in the &quot;Special Edition&quot; making this a bland shadow of the original.  Shame on you Disney!
B00005B1EX|5.0|This is a fantastic CD!!! It covers Halford's carrer with playing songs from Fight, Halford, and Judas Priest. There isn't a single Two song on here, so I don't know why the editorial review says that he covers his career with Two b/c he doesn't. If anyone thinks I'm wrong, look up Two:Voyeurs, and look at the track list and try to find one song from that CD which is Two's only CD on this CD. Read that carefully and it'll make sense. BUY THIS IF YOU'RE INTO HALFORD!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I've read Tolkien for the past 30 years--I'm a huge fan.  I am incredibly pleased with Peter Jackson's treatment of the material in these amazing films.  This is not only a momentous event in film-making history (shooting three films at once, with that many locations, extras, sets, miniatures, special effects, props, optical effects, etc.), but the majesty and timelessness of the story comes through extremely well.  This is an instant classic--something that generations will talk about.<br />I think I enjoyed this second part even more than the first.  With &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; we are introduced to the world, the characters, the society, and the story--but the character development and interaction which is necessary for us to be deeply involved has not had enough screen time... yet!  The Two Towers continues with this epic tale, cutting back and forth in an editing tour de force which keeps the pace quick and yet keeps the stories and characters and scenes unjumbled and clear.  We meet more charaters and creatures, and also get to know the personalities of the scattered members of the Fellowship as they begin to face greater and greater trials--which test their characters, heart and soul.<br />I saw the film in the theatres numerous times, and was always moved and in awe--of the event depicted and the breath-taking beauty of the New Zealand landscape that makes an appropriate backdrop for a story set when the world was young and great matters of heroism and treachery put the fate of entire civilizations and races in the balance.  So it was well worth it to me to spend money on a copy of the Theatrical version.<br />I will also purchase the Extended version, and eagery await the added wonders it will offer.  In this situation, it is purely win-win!!!
B000089RVX|3.0|I bought this initially because I thought Amy Lee?s face looked beautiful on the cover. Yup, hadn?t heard a single track at that point. This is a departure from my usual preferences, but I did enjoy it overall. I?ll go straight to the packaging and track-by-track review.<br />As I mentioned, Amy?s face gracing the cover was a good thing, and the back shows a rather somber shot of the rest of the band, along with the track-listing. Straightforward group portrait spread over the front and back of the cover in blue/black/white hues. Lyrics included, which is always a plus with me.<br />1.Going Under: Decent, but rather generic. It may be that it?s overshadowed by track two, but I feel that Going Under suffers from unoriginality/banality.<BR>2. Bring Me To Life: Great lead single. This song has many textures and there is definitely passion in the vocal presentation of this lyric. Though, personally, I?m getting tired of the male background singer posturing that muddies this beautiful piece on the ?wake me up?s.? It absolutely adds nothing. However, I still love the song.<BR>3. Everybody?s Fooled: Generic guitar playing, and inconsistent lyrics. I really don?t feel this song was one complete thought. It could just be me, but I really don?t care for this song at all. The breaks between nu-breed guitar licks and soft piano are starting to become a rather boring recipe here. Something new? please!<BR>4. Immortal: Yes! This song is a sonic masterpiece. It is beautiful, soft, and very appealing musically and lyrically. Amy delivers a vocal that conveys vulnerability, tenderness, and sadness. This is my fav. track on the cd, hands down.<BR>5. Haunted: Is it me, or does a great deal of this album remind anyone of a generic version of Lennon Murphy?s debut album (which preceded this release)? Decent guitar solo? Skip!<BR>6. Tourniquet: Distorted vocals at the start, which immediately loses my attention? by the time the song really kicks in, I?ve stopped caring. Next!<BR>7. Imaginary: Nice strings at the intro? Perfectly crafted and very interesting. The heavier guitar arrangements, piano and orchestra seem to be interwoven much more successfully than in other tracks. I think this would make an excellent choice for a second single.<BR>8. Taking Over Me: Somewhat haunting piano? leads to? ANOTHER GENERIC guitar riff? piano? generic guitar riff? etc. The lyrics are pretty boring as well. Instead of feeling sad for the author or feeling much of anything, I just feel inclined to refer her to a shrink. Obsessive personality disorder? combined with a low self-esteem... and it just doesn?t work. Come on, I know how bad love can hurt, but this is unintelligent and uninspired drivel.<BR>9. Hello: Just when I was starting to give up? Haunting piano melody. This is a relatively simple, but fantastic lyric. Crank it up and lose yourself in this short journey into the mind of an isolated, lonely soul. <BR>10. My Last Breath: This one doesn?t do anything for me. It?s just standard fare. Mediocre, but not unbearable.<BR>11. Whisper: This opens up with a cool riff from Ben Moody, and has a fresher edge than a lot of the other heavier offerings on ?Fallen.? I actually would have liked this a little better if it would have stayed in a harder rock vein throughout the song. But it?s still very enjoyable.<br />In summary, it?s a solid effort. If you loved the single, ?Bring Me To Life,? you?re sure to enjoy the disc. If you felt it was alright, but wanted to hear more, it?s very hit or miss. Nothing outright sucks, and there are quite a few shining moments, but it is not going to re-write the book of music. If you like this, check out Lennon?s ?5:30am Saturday Morning.? To me, that album is strides ahead of Evanescence. ?Fallen? seems almost schizo to me. It wants to rock hard, but can?t break the confines of string arrangements and gentle piano. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn?t.
B00005A8GY|3.0|Does anyone else notice or have a problem with about 5-10 seconds cut off the beginning of Hope You Are Feeling Better on the SACD version of this album, on the CD remaster it is fine????
B000000OA6|5.0|At this point, they were matured, and had perfected their sound.  Queen reached their climax right at the end.  I think Freddie's crisis brought on a new wisdom, that brought out the brilliance in the album Innuendo.  From the opener, Innuendo, one can only think that this cd will combine the highest of the 80's highs, with the best of the hard, heavy hitting stripped down rockers of the 70's.  <br />Innuendo is a great opener, with its fanfare-like introduction and its driving guitar throughout.  <br />I'm going slightly mad sounds just like a fun song, dark but great to listen to.  <br />Headlong and I Cant Live With You are two great rockers, heavy and great, nothing bad about them. They have this new blend with the best of the old and new Queen.  <br />Don't try so hard is a slow ballad, Ride the wild wind is somewhat of a faster ballad of sorts, and they come out with their driving parts, with freddie's brilliant vocal ability prominent especially on Don't try so hard.  <br />All god's people is a Queen take on gospel, with a rock interlude in the middle.  A great track.  <br />These are the days of our lives is light and contemporary, but comes out really cool.  It's a great listener and one of my favorites on the cd.  <br />Delilah is poppy, and it's about Freddie's cat, so you can see a huge freddie influence in this one.  It's great nevertheless.  Hitman is heavy and powerful, a real stripped down rocker.  <br />Bijou is a slow, mellow song with brian's heavy guitar soloing for a few minutes.  There is a short lyrical interlude of about 4 lines from freddy, and that makes the song a great one. <BR> <BR>Finally, the brilliant end to Queen.  The show must go on, in my opinion was the greatest farewell to a band i've ever heard.  Yes, it's hard to say this but it topped the beatles the end.  It was just so powerful, and with the go on... go on... go on... at the end, it shows a great and powerful fade to an amazing career.  Real touching song, and great videoof 80's queen clips.  <br />Overall, this cd is pure genius, pure brilliance, and they should be most proud of this cd today.
B00003CXFG|3.0|I'm not a huge Vin Diesel fan, but looking past his one dimensional acting ability. Pitch Black is a good movie.  Not great, but worth owning if you are a fan of this type of movie.  The bleached out look of the movie takes a little getting used to, it kind of detracts from the plot development.  I kept adjusting my t.v. thinking my contrast was out of sync.  The alien creatures are realistic and bloodthirsty, if not particularly cunning.  Well above a B-movie status, but not quite a blockbuster, I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.  Amazon only allows for whole numbers so the 3 stars should actually be 3 1/2.
6302610702|5.0|The Godfather has ensnared generations of moviegoers with its indefinable and spellbinding mystique. Every decade a new generation wonders what all the hullabaloo is about, as it hears tales from its preceding one told with the awe reserved for having witnessed a real-life experience, and seeks to explore, simply out of curiosity. And emerges from that 3-hour experience with the same wistful look in its eye. Of having felt - &quot;This is a different world I've entered, cut-off from the one I left outside the theatre. It works according to its own laws. I'm not sure I want to leave, but I'll always carry it with me.&quot; And thus, we go back, again, and again, and again, to see this film supposedly about mafias and gangs and their rulers and their mighty tiffs. We are ready to see men being strangulated in the back seat of cars, bullets battering a body on a lone highway, a girl being blown up, a blood-stained bath-tub, and the beheaded horse, if only we could get to see one more torturous time, Michael sitting alone on a bench, when all is over in Part 2, staring into the distance. And then to see the credits roll, and hear Nino Rota's mournful score, one more time. Yes this is a world of sordid crime, but to us it is a haven of respite. Yes its protagonist is the warlord of the underworld, but we find his story more bewitching than that of many heroes. Yes do speak softly love, for this is a timeless romance. <BR>What is it about the Godfather that reduces, critics and viewers alike, to mawkish rhapsodies? I think we owe this experience to the staggering technical achievements of this film. We see the Godfather as visual, sonic, dramatic, and musical poetry; it is poetry that is painstakingly crafted. <BR>Every time one sees the movie one discovers new things, a hallmark of a great work. One of the most interesting things is the sound. Not the music; the sound of feet, the screeching wheels and car engines, children playing in the background, the clap of thunder,the jazz playing on the streets, the dialing of a phone, an eagle cawing, the slow measured voices, and also the silences; the sound editing is perfectly executed and significantly heightens the tension of the movie. This is a movie that one could hear, not see, and yet be enthralled. <BR>Coppola makes great use of contrasting sounds and images at the same time. For instance, ominous dialogues are set against backdrop of chatter of children playing and playful jazz music. After Hagen is kidnapped by Solozzo there is a cynical shot of a Santa Claus in a shop window. <BR>There are many subtle symbolisms. There is the scene where when Michael learns that his father has been shot he is agitated and calling home from a public booth. In the background Kay is standing outside the booth, with the glass separating them looking anxiously at him. It is a sign of the rift that will now develop between them. <BR>A notable feature is the transition of one scene to another. After the shot showing the cut off head of Woltz's horse the picture dissolves into a shot of the Godfather, his face impassive, his chin determined. After the bridal scene of Michael and Apollonia, the shot changes to Kay entering the Corleone house. Such transitions speak volumes. <BR>Coppola takes time with his scenes. The scene with Michael and Solozzo in the restaurant is an example. It's builds up very slowly. At one point the camera waits for the waiter to cork open a bottle of wine while Solozzo and Michael eye each other, one with suspicion, and the other with suppressed hostility. Coppola very painstakingly builds the ambience of each scene with his measured progression, so that we are completely drawn into this haunting world. Whether it's the Don holding court, the Woltz mansion, a street, a hospital, a restaurant, Sicily, a graveyard or a church, all the time we are there, in the scene, living it all the way. Though this is a thoroughly romanticized depiction of the gangster world, it all seems real. The director slowly engrosses the viewer into the scene and builds it up to a climax. This approach is carried scene by scene. Each scene ends with a mini-climax and the movie progresses climax by climax to its thundering and numbing end. <BR>The last segment of Part 1 - the baptism, the end of Carlo Rizzi, and the confrontation between Kay and Michael - is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. <BR>There is nothing superfluous in the film, each little detail builds the picture into a whole, heightening the drama, increasing our understanding of characters and adding additional strokes to the large and sprawling canvas on which it is depicted.<BR>Today, three generations on, the Godfather films remain, in addition to being shattering celluloid masterpieces, an educating experience in the art of film-making to movie artisans and a lesson to audiences in the discerning skill of film appreciation.
B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Matthews is one of if not not my favorite bands.  This cd Crash was the first DMB album that I ever had.  The entire cd is increadable from the first song to the last.  The song crash is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  I would recommend this cd to everyone from the president to my parents.

B000002IOW|5.0|after dark and synthetic experiments from eigthies this phenomenal trio recorded a bit simplier,more polished but definitly Rock album.there are no noisy synths,the sound is crystal clear and Geddy's bass and voice are simply irresistible.all song are wonderfull - &quot;Presto&quot;,&quot;Anagram&quot;,&quot;Red tide&quot; and my favourite funky rocker &quot;Hand over fist&quot;.these are the best songs that band wrote since &quot;moving pictures&quot;<BR>get &quot;Presto&quot; out now!
B00006L9ZT|1.0|Maybe Wagner is just not for me. But I have to say that I'm bored dead by this dvd recording. The drama is presented in such a lifeless way that the acts seem to be interminable!<br />The singing also doesn't give much joy and the acting is in most parts rudimentary. This recording certainly won't be of any help to convert me to Wagner.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|I think all the people who are calling this EP whack are listening to it with the wrong expectations.  It's not supposed to be some commercial/radio-friendly album; it's all about the art of creating \\"real\\" music.  I love this album; it's like a Phish/Widespread Panic album for the soul genre.  So much awesome experimentation and forays into different types of music (jazz, hip-hop, old-school soul, new-school beats, electronica, rock, etc.) and Ms. Badu never sounded better.  Her topics are wonderful, with songs for partying and for thinking.  I love \\"Bump It\\", the \\"Love of My Life\\" remix and \\"Back in the Day (Puff)\\" the best.  Don't listen to the haters; go get it if you appreciate \\"real\\" music and people jamming out!

It is vey real as it is read and even when I think about it I can see myself in the middle of the Overlook hotel. Overall this book is way better than I had thought it was going to be. I recommend this book if you are looking for a good book that you will want to read just to keep busy. Trust me, you will only want to put it down when it gets too intense for you to read.
0316666343|5.0|This may be the most satisfying novel I've read in ages. Told from the point of view of Susie, the ghost of young murder and rape victim, we see what has become of her family and relive the highlights of her short and innocent life. There were passages in this book that moved me to tears, yet this is no cheesy page-turner, this is a literary novel -- a beautifully written, wonderfully paced rumination of the brevity -- and sometimes -- unfairness of life. Truly a wonderful, unforgetable book! Also recommended: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B000002HEP|5.0|This is Kyuss' masterpiece, their opus to what heavy metal can and should be (even though the band itself wouldn't want to be labelled as 'metal').Joe Carducci once described their sound as 'heavy qua heavy' and I couldn't agree more.From the sonic blast of the opener 'Gardenia' you know you're onto something awesome here. Their sound is both loose and refined, jumping from brute power to delicate acoustic strumming. The band were at their peak here, revelling in their jam-heavy, proto-psychedelic, metal epic style while ignoring all other trends of the time. The standout track is 'Supa Scoop and Mighty Scoop'. It starts off with a single guitar riffing away while John Garcia bellows non-sensical lyrics over top. The band kicks in and Kyuss' trademark bass-heavy rumbling blurs the dinstinct instruments into one mass of sludge. Songs like '100 Degrees' and 'Conan Troutman' were all about getting bludgeoned with that very sound, while on 'Space Cadet' and the end bit of 'Whitewater' the band shows versatility in their craft and noodles away at their instruments.  'Demon Cleaner' was the hit off the album, with its appropiately spooky accompanying video, and the blues riff on 'N.O.' showed the band to be Black Sabbath's heir apparent. And I dare you to put the instrumental 'Asteroid' on your headphones full blast. The part where the band kicks into the main riff is sure to scare the bejeezus out of you while blowing out your eardrums. Kyuss truly embody everything that is cool about heavy music. They can be loud and menacing and make your innards shake, but they never sacrifice melody or tunefulness. It's never heavy for heavy's sake. Each band member seemed to have a unique personality that contributed to their sound as well:Garcia looked and sang like a typical metalhead;Josh Homme was the resident punk rock geek and looked like an accountant at times;Scott Reeder was like an evil hippie prowling barefoot on stage while thumping his bass and Brant Bjork was the mellow dude who looked like he was an extra in a Cheech and Chong movie, but who became a wild beast behind the drum kit.The band kinda got lost in the grunge shuffle back when this was first released and only became really popular post-humously, especially in Scandinavia, and they are now revered as a massively influental cult band (much like the Velvet Underground and the Stooges before them)with all the newcomers wishing they got to see them when they were still kickin' it live. Their sound diversified with their following album 'And The Circus Leaves Town'(how many bands do you know that put out TWO classic albums in a row?) and former members later mutated into Queens of the Stone Age, but nowhere were they more powerful than on this one sole slab of gargantuan fury.
B0000524CY|3.0|There is an added scene in this version which shows Regan crawling down the stairs backwards. It totally does not fit in with the mood of the film, and I can understand why it was left out of the original version. It is almost comical in its fast motion pace. It is my opinion that it is not even original footage, but a digital creation in order to boost the sales of the DVD, thus being praised as &quot;lost footage&quot;.<br />There are also flashes of demonic faces throughout this new version. While a few carefully placed faces were effective, I think they went overboard and used it too much.<br />Other things to look for:<br />When Regan levitates off the bed, you can see the wires holding her up.<br />When her eyes are pure white, her eyes were actually closed and her eyelids had white makeup on them.<br />The film is beautifully photographed and acted. The mood is chilling and the music effective. The scariest movie ever? That is a matter of opinion. You can sing one song, I can sing another.<br />I just don't see the need for this &quot;new version&quot;. I'll stick to the old.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I don't know why so many people hate on this movie.  Personally I thought it was the greatest movie, the special effects were unbelievable.  Not only that but I thought the story line was great, I think the people who are hating the Matrix Reloaded are the ones who couldn't understand it.  Overall, I recommend this movie for anyone and everyone.
B00008NRI8|2.0|Sandra Bullock tries the old, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; routine for this movie.  This movie was not funny at all.  Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off.  Hugh Grant is wasted in his role.  Overall, this is a dud.
0804106304|5.0|I loved the book! It made me feel so at home with the thought of making mistakes and being the family screw up.It taught me about the old ways of the women back in the 1900's in ancient China. Between the 4 mothers and the 4 daughters there is a great difference in their behaviors and values. Throughout the whole novel Amy Tan brilliantly illustrated the times, the settings and how the events occurred.The mothers were strong willed, highly strict in the old ways of tradition, and held true to their beliefs. The daughters adapted well to the new and modern ways of the Americans, but sadly along the way lossed the meaning in what their families trully represented.The somewhat lossed daughters were eventually saved by their overbarring mothers with the traditions of their ancestors.
0385504209|1.0|I feel violated having read the Da Vinci Code.<br />It was not well written, had glaring historical inaccuracies, and predictable plot twists.<br />The biggest question I have is why did an author attempting to bring attention to the goddess cult make the only female character incredibly stupid?  She is blindly influenced by the male characters in an extremely pathetic manner.
B000089RVR|5.0|I wasn't the biggest fan of Dido's first CD to be honest.  When I heard she was coming out with a second one I wasn't sure what I thought.  Then I heard &quot;Whiteflag&quot; on the radio and instantly fell in love with it.  The day the CD came out I took the chance and bought it.  I did a fast run through when I got home and wasn't sure what I thought about it.  When I finally sat down and really listened to it I was very impressed.  Every song on the CD is excellent.  The lyrics really do get to you.  I just recently went throught a really bad break-up and can relate to all the lyrics.  My favorite song off the CD though is &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; which I'm listening to right now.  I've met someone new and this song really says how I feel about him.  If your reading this and your wondering wheather to buy this CD or not...buy it.  I promise you won't regret it at all.  This CD is honestly the greatest.  This is for sure Dido at her best.  I can't wait to see what she's got for us in the future after this!!!
067144901X|5.0|As an early intervention speech-language pathologist, I find this book irresistible from a language development perspective.  The rhymes are engaging and simple and children delight in the absurdity of Boynton's text.  Animal sounds are often some of the first \\"words\\" children acquire.  I have used this as a clinician and I use it now as the mother of three pre-schoolers.  A must-have for any pre-school library.
B0000042H4|5.0|I own a number of recordings of this work: this one, one conducted by Karajan, and a very bad recording with Flagstad from a live performance from La Scala. This one tops the list all the time. Though I enjoy the Karajan version, there are things he does which I think are completely wrong, even if they are tradition. Wagner wrote certain crudities into the score (like the steerhorns in Gotterdammerung) and hearing them played by the mellow and very musical trombones removes the ruggedness Wagner was looking for. Solti, on the other hand, tried to be faithful to Wagner, even by using the crude and unmusical steerhorns. The result was electrifying. One of the things that make this RING better than most all other version is the fact it was recorded not to make music, but to make drama. Other recordings are faithful to the music, but the real drama is lost. <br />Some critics disapprove of some of the &quot;sound affects&quot; that were used in this recording. True, hitting a piece of railroad track with a hammer to give us the impressive sound of Donner's hammer in Das Rhinegold may be over the top, but it adds super great theatre to the work, and I think it is what Wagner would have approved of, since we were meant to hear that hammer (and after all, it is the hammer of a god, shouldn't it have more of a ring than a mortal blow would?). <br />The sound affects while Siegfried is forging his sword only add to the tension of the scene. We are not just hearing great singing, we are hearing great drama. All the forging sounds are written into the score (Wagner even indicates where large heavy hammers are to hit the anvil, and when small ones are) and for once we actually hear them clearly. In performance, they usually fade into nothing. Then there is the exciting sound of the anvil being cut in half and falling to the ground. One never hears that in performance, nor on any other recordings of the ring. Yet, Wagner wanted us to hear and see it, and he wrote as such in hisscore. <br />Sometimes Solti is accused of being too brash and noisy, well, this is Wagner's noisiest opera (excepting Rienzi, where the entire chorus of soldiers are to be hitting their shields with their swords during one scene, a thing one NEVER sees or hears in performance), and his most exciting work. The RING rushes forward, even though it is very long, pulling us into a very different world from our own. Solti never loses momentum. <br />The little touches, or sound affects, add to the drama before us. We hear Woton strike the rock calling forth Loge on Brunhilde's rock. We hear his spear break. We sense the entire world burning up and being renewed at the end of Brunhilde's immolation scene. <br />All recordings of the RING are fabulous, it is hard to find a bad one, but this one towers over them all because it makes the work a whole. I guess in some ways it is closer to what Wagner hoped with his idea of drama, music, and words getting equal treatment. This recording is musical, it is dramatic, and the words are heard. It is the only one out there that gives us a complete work unifying everything into a wondrous whole. <br />It is expensive but well worth the price.
B000099T2L|1.0|This cd is way too overrated and hyped up by mtv.There is only one good song and the rest is just filler material.Even though the song crazy in love is good,jay z ofcourse has to ruin it at the end.95 percent of the album is bland and boring with average beats.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is just plain good and very well worth owning.Ride the lightning is not as raw or fast as kill em all was,but its heavier and the production is better.It's a step up from their previous album.GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!
B00006CXXU|4.0|I liked her first album knew that she could &quot;blow&quot;, but on this CD she has great lyrics and puts a lot of feeling into it, the dance songs are hot &quot;Dirty&quot; and It's definitely worth adding to your collection. There are so many songs that I like, but hands down &quot;Loving Me For Me&quot; is my favorite.  I really hope this is released as a single and a video is done for it, it' a softer side a Christina, she's not oversinging on it and the music compliments her voice very well.  This CD is a bit long, but it's overall very nice.
B000099T2L|4.0|This cd is like that tracks one through six are my favorites Beyonce  is a real good writer and has proved that on this joint for real but she still has a way to go her voice has changed slightly but not a whole lot also I didnt skip from song to song when i poped the cd in my cd player at all and the pictures in the cd book off the rack they like that this cd is worth the money  &quot;Baby Boi&quot; is my shizt right now i rocked that joint to death when i first heard it on the cd cant wait for another album Bee
B00009V7T2|3.0|I picked up this CD on a whim because it was decently priced and enigmatic enough to spark my interest.  I didn't really know what to expect since I'd never heard of the band before, though I had a bad feeling considering the CD's being pushed on the shelf besides it.<br />I opened up the sleeve notes to find a bunch of poetry, which after listening to the CD a couple of times, seems to be there for some touchy feely reason I can't define; maybe to give us insight as to what inspired the album.  I actually found a lot of the stuff in the notes very provocative, though I have no clue what it has to do with the music.<br />There are some fairly interesting stretches on the disc (the signature changes, for example, in &quot;drunkship of lanterns,&quot; while fairly basic is somewhat interesting).  Overall, the general image the album portrays from it's cover and song titles seemed very misleading; I find little more than a generic rock album concerning the actual music here.  It's definetely not as profound as some of the other more successful mainstream rock acts out there (A Perfect Circle, Dysrhythmia, Coldplay).  I found the overall sound of the CD was a little formulaic with hints of discord; the band was basically dressing plain rock with art-deco in the form of haughty lyrics and pervasive ambient sounds.  While the music itself isn't bad, it doesn't have as much depth as these guys would like you to believe, and consists very basically of guitar, bass, voice and drums in a method that doesn't depart from many other Nu metal bands and doesn't musically do anything too well.  However, they do have a decent sound, and I think with a little more musicianship they could put some of the concepts they're moving towards onto a better interpretive medium for the listener.<br />Abstract imagery and ambiguity is great in art, but it should not stop at pretense.  This album places pretense before substance; and that's annoying.  There's no great revelation or any meaning to dissect in the music, just plain emotion that stems from chaos(contrived or heartfelt), which ends with no moral or fable as to why we've taken this journey and what we've gained from it.  Purpose should have been the focus of the album, not obscurity.<br />A decent buy, make sure you don't judge it too early and don't go into it with any expectations.  Take it for what it is and don't mystify it.  You may like it more than me.to dissect in the music, just plain emotion that stems from chaos(contrived or heartfelt), which ends with no moral or fable as to why we've taken this journey and what we've gained from it.

B0000691U1|5.0|A very elevated and sophisticated project.  We are hearing honor students of Jazz play with the same force and suspense of a big band but trio-simplified.  Ellington, Roach, &amp; Mingus are testifying that music can be classic and cool at the same time.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|What can I say, this EP(for you who think it's an LP and expected more songs do your homework) is the Bomb!!!!! Please listen to the CD from Beginning to end without skipping a song FIRST to get the &quot;Theme&quot; of it, then go from there.  EVERY song has it's own merit and treat! I could break them all down, but that would take to long, just sit back and feel the GROOVE!  This project is a true Jam Session!!! Stop wanting another Mama's Gun or Baduizm, she's already done that!  Her Band is the TRUTH! This EP is for Grown Folks!!!! The 25 and up crowd, who can appreciate some real heat in the midst of all the same old same on the radio!!! THE GUITAR SOLO AT THE END OF &quot;I WANT U&quot; IS WICKED AND THE PIANO AND HORNS ON &quot;DANGER&quot; IS SOOO FUNKY!! A true Gem, ONE TO GROOVE TO!!!
0393057658|5.0|I give Moneyball on the basis that it's reader is either a devout student and fan of the game such as myself, or someone who is big into small-business ownership.  Yes, Lewis does add some &quot;filler&quot;  to his novel by adding life stories and background to Bradford and Hatteberg, but at the same time this builds the psychological models of what exactly it means to be an &quot;Oakland A&quot; in Beane's model.  The only real complaint I have with the novel is wanting more.  A must read for any true baseball fan.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Ive got to take up for the Wachowski brothers.  This movie was not only great but surpassed the orginal.  The special effects were amazing and you actually get to see what life would be like, if you lived outside &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  They did a great job extending the story line into part two from the orginal and it will probably be even better in the last movie.  If you did not find this movie to be a master-piece then you obviously have no artistic conseption.
6300213714|5.0|who are the warriors? well every gang wants to know. the warriors are accused of killing Cyrus, one of the powerful gang lords. they have to make it back to Coney Island in time, hopping on train to train and dodging gangs left and right. the suspense and action never let go and you feel for the warriors when one of them falls. the best scene is when they fight the baseball gang in the park. dont those guys ever quit and theres a lot of other cool scenes involving fighting other gangs. one of the best films of 1979
B00007BHOE|5.0|Slipknot have been my favorite band ever since I heard their demo of &quot;Spit It Out&quot; when they got signed back in '99. As soon as I heard that one, I was instantly hooked. So you can imagine how excited I was when I learned they were to release a live DVD. This was something I had been waiting for years for!!! A few days before X-Mas I saw it and bought it for myself haha since my family for some reason never know what to buy me (music-wise) and since I already knew I was getting either an XBox or a DVD player, I bought it and had to wait 2 DAYS FAR TOO F-CKING LONG to watch this, but let me tell you it was well worth it. Every song performed on this flawless concert is basically all their best. Not to mention all their music videos and the recently unavailabe and awesome track &quot;Purity&quot; on Disc 2. But they could have played more songs (esp. Diluted, Prosthetics, I Am Hated...), but it's Slipknot so it doesn't matter, for whatever they do is godlike to my eyes. Do yourself a favor, if you are a fan of the mighty Slipknot in ANY way, and you don't own this... I pity you. I feel like I'm babbling on like a moron because mere words simply cannot described the greatness on these two discs. Wether you are new to this band or are an old-school hardcore 'Knot fan, you definitely ought to check this out. Plus, it's a damn good price for a 2-disc DVD. Check it out and keep heavy music alive!
0790736039|4.0|my favorite Stephen King book brought to movie besides Dreamcatcher. Tim Curry, who better to play Pennywise the clown then him. he's so awesome in this role. not much of a horror movie then you'd expect, plus its a TV movie. but people who are afraid of clowns beware, Pennywise will scare the pants off you, or not. great cast includes John Ritter(may he rest in peace) as Ben Hanscomb, Annette O'Toole as Beverly Marsh, Tim Reid as Michael Hanlon, Richard Thomas as Billy Boy, Harry Anderson as Richie Tozier, Richard Mauser as Stan, Jonathan Brandis as Young Bill and a everso recognizable Seth Green as Young Richie Tozier. I wanna live in Derry, well where they shot the film anyway. I'd love to live at that place. theres some dry acting in this as well and some stupidparts too, just dont let that ruin the movie for you
B00005U122|5.0|I have written very few &quot;Amazon&quot; reviews, considering the massive number of CDs and music DVD's I've purchased over the years.  But Roger Waters' &quot;In the Flesh&quot; compels me to put my feelings into words.  I am a big fan of early-to-mid '70's &quot;intelligent&quot; rock -- bands like Yes, pre-pop Genesis, ELP, and of course Pink Floyd fill my CD shelves.  Like many other fans, I eagerly (and painfully) await the release of &quot;Pulse&quot; on DVD (will that EVER happen...?).  But, I thought, in its place, let's give &quot;In the Flesh&quot; a try.  I am SO SORRY that I missed this show live when it came to my area.  This is by far the most sublime and masterful rock performance I have ever seen, and the video and audio quality are nothing short of astonishing.  But what really stands out -- as it should -- is the intensity and quality of the music itself.  Waters &amp; Co. play with consummate skill on track after track of classic Floyd material.  But the absolute crowning jewel of this collection is the full-length, album-perfect performance of &quot;Dogs&quot;.  Now, I happen to believe that &quot;Animals&quot; was Floyd's best work, and that &quot;Dogs&quot; was the brightest gem on that astounding album.  The performance of &quot;Dogs&quot; in this DVD brought tears to my eyes at the musicianship, the power of Waters' composition, the dagger-sharp sting of his lyrics, and the skill with which it was all presented.  The theatrical sequence, when Roger sits down to a game of cards with his band-mates (in mid-song...!), is both bizarre and genius, all at once.  Do not hesitate -- BUY this DVD now, and thank me later.
6304106017|4.0|Rodriquez has got the juice. putting action and horror into one. so radical. This movie has a lot of bloodshed and bodyparts flying around the place. sorta like a rip off of Natural Born Killers but with vampires and this movie is better then that movie. The cast is great, including George Clooney as Seth Geiko. nice vampire transformations and the feeling of the intense horror they all had to endure.<br />Seth(Clooney)-&quot; psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I dont give a **ck how crazy they are!!!&quot;
B00003CXB4|5.0|Okay now I preordered this awhile back at a Disney store knowing it would be a great release since I liked &quot;The Lion King&quot; when I first saw it in theaters. Unfortunately I missed the IMAX release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; But I did see the IMAX release of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and own the DVD. Now first off the added musical score &quot;Morning Report&quot; I didn't care for. I liked the non musical version of that scene better, but hey that's me. Now as for the whole DTS confusion that my cousin brought to my attention. Well their isn't exactly a DTS track but the &quot;Disney Home Theater Mix&quot; could definitly pass as a DTS track, it was a great mix. If you do like the original &quot;theatrical release&quot; better than you can watch that instead. This option is contained in the audio options I notioced, when you select the audio track there is two section's one for Special Edition one for Original Theatrical release both have the Disney Home Theater Mix and both have the standard Dobly tracks selection.<br />All in all this was a great DVD and I haven't gotten thru all the special features yet so I can't say anything but everybody whos seen &quot;The Lion King&quot; should definitely get this DVD I think it's a great buy.
B000068MFS|5.0|I enjoyed this picture. very great chemistry by John Cusack(Identity, High Fidelity, Grosse Pointe Blank, Better Off Dead) and Kate Beckinsale( Pearl Harbor, The Last Days Of Disco, Laurel Canyon and Underworld2003). Cusack and Beckinsale have a once in a lifetime oppurtunity and they go their seperate ways. then years later the 2 still think of one another. Cusack is getting married and Beckinsale is engaged to John Corbett(TV's Lucky). plus theres great fun by Jeremy Piven(The Family Man, Old School, Judgment Night and PCU) as Cusack's friend who helps him look for the girl and a funny part by Eugene Levy(American Pie 1,2,3, Like Mike, Armed and Dangerous and Almosy Heroes) as the clerk. funniest scene is when Levy gives Piven a neck rub, Ilaughed my ass off. great fun
B00000DGUY|4.0|Being in my mid-50's, I missed out on the band's hey day.  But after purchasing Mark Knopfler's &quot;The Ragpieker's Dream&quot; and hearing Sultan's of Swing on our local NPR station, I was hooked.<br />&quot;The Best of....is one of my best CD purchases.  My 22 yr old son is now a fan also.  That's what it's all about (in my opinion).
B0000A2ZO1|3.0|I liked this movie. Stewart is commanding as always a jean luc-picard. there are some down falls to this. like Data(Brent Spiner) singing songs and other nitbits. Tom Brady(the evil ... Shinzon) is great. lots of cool scenes with superb action. though we will sorely miss Data and this is directed by Stuart Baird people(director of U.S. Marshals, Executive Decision..etc..etc..) and he directs will ease. <br />favorite line<BR>Shinzon- \\"don't be so vain.\\"
0792165020|5.0|This movie has great a plot, photography, wonderful actors and actresses and is made with  beauty... Jude Law's perform is so wonderful, I think nobody else could make Dickie's character as him, so real, charming and full of life... Matt Damon... I'm sure he made it very well, convincing and disgusting because I can't see him anymore with good eyes (I really hate Ripley)...
B000089RVR|4.0|I like this album very much. It's great! Probably it's the best album of Dido so far.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Weak acting, bad casting and poor storyline are the three nails in this film's coffin.  Affleck doesn't bring anything to his role and did Jennifer Garner just phone her performance in?  Was she heavily medicated?  Or does the woman just have no personality to speak of?  I don't know and this movie didn't make me care, either.<br />Sadly, the most entertaining feature of this film is actually Colin Farrel as Bullseye.  This is sad because the character as presented in the film is utterly preposterous and non-sensical (even for a comic book movie) and Farrel hams it up above and beyond the call of duty.  I guess that's a good thing since Affleck and Garner both provide the most uninteresting superheroes ever put to film.  Even the action in the movie was weak, which is what you get for putting Affleck in a big action role, I guess.  The fight choreography was dull and less inspired than what you're apt to see in a Saturday morning cartoon.  Bad, bad filmmaking.<br />I'm sure this joke has already been made, but this movie left me wishing I was blind too, so I wouldn't have had to watch it.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Everytime someone talks about Muse there's a strange urge in finding some other band to compare them to. Well, let's just say it's helpless.<BR>Muse is a genius of its own. People compared them to Radiohead, Queen, Led Zeppelin or whatever.<BR>They're much more down to earth than Radiohead, much more complicated than Queen and much more substacial than Led Zeppelin.<BR>The Muse sound is actually quite unique. It's a mix of heaven and hell. Listen to Stockholm Syndrome and you'll understand what I mean.<BR>But it's also a mix of musical cultures that surprises you all the time. Listen to the passage between Hysteria and Blackout. No words to describe it.<br />Origin of Symmetry sort of scared me. I kind of despaired that every following work wouldn't have matched its beauty. Well, guess what, I feel totally relieved. This record goes even beyond its predecessor. OoS was an unbelievable collection of awesome tracks but it didn't really have a clear identity of its own.<BR>Absolution is an opera. Simply put, you never feel like activating the shuffle option on your cd player. It's more mature, in a way.<br />Muse will never sell millions of records. It never could in a world dominated by musical clones. They keep on making their music regardless of commercial laws. Geniuses never come to a compromise.<BR>Keep your inspiration, Muse!!!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|To be completely honest, I did not like the first two Godsmack CD's, so when I got this CD as a present from a friend I was not exactly thrilled, but I put on a fake smile and gave a polite &quot;Thanks&quot;. This CD sat on my dresser for 2 or 3 weeks until I finally decided &quot;Oh what the hell&quot; and popped it in my Discman and amazingly I listend through the whole CD and loved every minute of it. I Stand Alone, Faceless and Straight Out of Line are killer songs and the rest of the CD is just as good. This CD is damn good and I've been thanking my friend alot more for giving it to me.<BR>Buy this CD, you will not be dissapointed!
B000002HRE|4.0|This album really grew on me. At first, as with Load, I dismissed their new sound as being dumbed-down \\"country-metal\\" that didn't hold a candle to the 80's albums. Indeed, this is not as good as Master of Puppets or Justice, but it certainly is good in its own right. Reload doesn't possess the same flow that previous albums do - they seem to experiment a lot more on this one. While all 8 tracks on Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning have a general similarity in sound, songs on Reload often sound drastically different from one another. The results are much better than 1996's \\"Load\\", which was tainted (in my humble opinion) by being too country-influenced and uninspired.     1.) Fuel: Fast, heavy, and short. A good song, although I don't care much for the twang on the guitar riff here. The speed and awesome drumming by Lars more than make up for it. Good way to start things off, and it's miles ahead of \\"Ain't My Bitch\\". Really shines when its played live.           2.) The Memory Remains: Pretty mainstream and radio-friendly. While Marianne Faithful's vocals work, her voice just gets irritating after a few listens. Still, one of the better songs of the album.      3.) Devil's Dance: Didn't much care for this. Interesting lyrics can't make up for the plodding pace.                          4.) The Unforgiven II: A heavier version of the original. I liked them both alright, and actually prefer this one. In fact, this could've easily replaced it on the Black album.     5.) Better Than You: Pretty repetitive vocals (\\"better than yoooouuuu!\\" x 20..). On the upside, it is pretty heavy and good for what it is.     6.) Slither: One of the better tracks on the album. The riff is Sandman in reverse - sounds pretty cool. \\"No, there ain't no heroes here\\"     7.) Carpe Diem Baby: Way too slow for my tastes and never really picks up. filler        8.) Bad Seed: Great drumming by Lars and a good guitar solo save it from being mediocre. You might wonder at this point why I gavethe album 4-stars, which brings us to the next track...            9.) Where The Wild Things Are: This one can actually hang with their old stuff. People who cry that this album lacks creativity can eat their words. An eerie introduction leads right into awesome power chords, some very Alice In Chains-influenced vocals and creepy lyrics to go with it. One of my favorite songs Metallica has done, post-Justice era.     10.) Prince Charming: Has speed that previous songs on the album lack. Not very catchy and the lyrics are questionable (\\"Hey ma, look it's me\\"?), but it's worth a listen.      11.) Low Man's Lyric: Slow and plodding. If you liked Nothing Else Matters and Hero of the Day, you'd probably like this. I didn't.     12.) Attitude: Usually skip this one, but it's similar to Prince Charming/Fuel.    13.) Fixxxer: This track alone makes the album worth buying. It's about voodoo - not a bad subject for a heavy metal song! The lead guitar is just awesome here and keeps the tempo. This doesn't sound like normal Metallica (with slower guitar wahs instead of speedy riffs), but for once, it actually WORKS. James's vocals are gritty and heavy, and everyone (especially Kirk) shines. Better than anything off the Black album.                    Be patient and listen to this with an open mind, because it's not the same Metallica from Kill Em' All or Puppets. It's also not the 1980's anymore, and their sound has changed just like everything else has. Reload is hardly a disappointment, with amazing tracks like Fixxxer and Where The Wild Things Are. The fans who grew up with Metallica, who can appreciate the evolution and experimentation of their sound, are also the ones who realize that they haven't \\"lost their touch\\" just yet.
0141439831|2.0|While interesting, I found this to be a laborious read.  The first 135 pages are spent setting the scene and building atmosphere, thereby setting the pace for the whole novel.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity was a smart thriller.  John Cusack usually means the movie will be at least worth watching.  This movie does not break that streak.  The one knock on this movie is that it gets a bit far fetched at times, but then you realize why near the end of the movie.  While many movies follow a simple plot that repeats itself time and time again, this movie goes it's own way.  I was really in the dark as to what was going on until the very end.  The DVD is solid, having an alternate ending and some good commentary.  This is a good rental on a Friday night, but whether you want to add it to your collection is another story.

B0000BYM3K|4.0|First let me say I bought this CD the day it was released. I never write a review without listening to the disc at least 10 times(I am now at about  200 listens, I can't get enough.) When I first listened I was not all that impressed, but after about the fifth listen I relized how awesome this CD really is. It is a bit different from Brave New World, but they are both superb discs. I believe if some of the people who are giving this CD bad reviews would just listen a few more times they just might change their mind. I love the energy in the music and lyrics. These guys are incredible writers,and musicians. My only complaint about this disc is the production. I don't understand why so many releases are coming out in this day and age with such lackluster production,(Rush Vapor Trails Good CD bad production-Moving picture has an awesome sound and that was back in 1980, also Metallica's St. Anger's production is the worst. come on people this is 2003 technology is better than this.) Anyway that is why I am giving this CD 4 stars instaed of 5. Still a must have for any maiden fan, great disc 100 times better than all that new rock the major labels are pushing these days. UP THE IRONS BABY...
B00000IBRI|5.0|Argento's loose again, and he's doing the whole unknown killer knocking off women thing.  But, he must have had some of Inferno and Suspiria clinging to him, coz we have a little bit of that supernatural weirdness mixed in with this film.  It plays out like a merging of his two film styles.  The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly is the lead, but this is no Labyrinth.  She's got some nasty stuff to deal with here.  Aside from being a sleuth with insect pals, she has to deal with being a &quot;freak&quot; at her school, classmates with Bee Gee shirts, dead girls popping up everywhere, a chimpanzee wielding a razor, poison pills, puking, maggot pools, a mutant kid, and a very long telephone cord.  Plus, a film that plays Iron Maiden's &quot;Flash Of The Blade&quot; in almost all of it's entirety can't be all that bad.  Donald Pleasance is here too!  Who doesn't love that guy?  So grab this sucker before it disappears from the shelves.  After all, you're not a communist, are you?
B0000024ZT|1.0|Stunk, BOO!  I'm not even sure what this is supposed to be.  Sounded like the tape got caught in the tape deck.  I can't believe Manfred Mann heard 'Blinded By the Light' and said, &quot;Oh ya...let's cover that tune.&quot;
0743244249|1.0|I don't need 1000 words to express my lack of enthusiasm for this book, my first DeLillo read. For the first 50 pages I took notice of his use of adjectives, quite innovative. The rest of the book, about a heartless, robotic man who &quot;becomes&quot; what he &quot;sees&quot; is nonsensical and cold. I knew what the ending would be, but held back my desire to skip to it and end the torture. Definitely not recommended for anyone who appreciates good literature or is looking for news on the human character or condition.
B000068PQ0|3.0|OK, I only just bought this album, mainly because it was on sale, and also I had heard a lot of good things about it.<BR>At the end of last year, the album was named number one in a year-end countdown by the music reviewers of the NZ Herald. <BR>These same reviewers had named Coldplay's 'Parachutes' the best album the year before (and I enjoyed that) so i thought I'd give it a chance.<br />I do like it. I had been exposed to Track 8 'It's Summertime' for the whole of last summer, as a TV station over here (TV One) used it as it's identification music between programmes.<br />I grew up in the 70's and don't much like the electronic kind of music, but this has some quite nice melodies. My favourite has to be All We Have Is Now, a kind of Lennon-esque modern 'Day In The Life'. One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21 is great as well.<br />Come to think of it, the whole album gives me the same vibe as the album 'Time' by Electric Light Orchestra from 1981. If you liked that album, you'll probably like this one, although the songs aren't quite as good as those on Time. It has the same sci-fi story kind of feel to it though.<br />So, good songs with hip-hop drum beat stuff, and a lot of electronic noises. Actually, the noises themselves are quite interesting to listen to in their own right. More so than the 'bubbling' noises in The High Llama's 'Cold and Bouncy' album.<br />I'm not sure if the alubm will become a 'classic' in my turn table, but give it a try - you might like it.<br />da5id
B0000C7PSW|5.0|In fact I've scarcely heard the whole thing because I can't get enough of the first three tracks.  <br />I do however have a quibble - although the production is in general very good -- lush and full -- I thought that there was some room for improvement in the mastering process.  I felt as if they hadn't listened to it through enough sets of speakers to properly shelf the various instruments.
B0000AKY7O|5.0|This is Santana's fifth album originally released in November 1973. A mixture of fusion and blues, it's also the only studio album to feature jazz artist Leon Thomas on vocals (he sings on three of the tracks). As far as the content ,it's not dissimilar to its predecessor &quot;Caravanserai&quot; in that it's mostly instrumental and has no hit singles. It's the kind of album to be played straight. &quot;Mantra&quot; is bonus track with a great rhythm. The title track was written by John Coltrane. &quot;Flame-Sky&quot; was co-written with John McLaughlin and runs eleven minutes.<br />If you liked &quot;Caravanserai&quot;, you'll have no trouble listening to this album of mystical and spiritual tunes. Why this album had been out of print is beyond me.
B000002GK1|4.0|Badmotorfinger might not be quite as melodic as the&iacute;r following release, the smash hit Superunknown, but it is nevertheless a brilliant grunge album. Tracks like &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, &quot;Outshined&quot;, &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; and especially the psychedelic masterpiece of a song &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; prove that when it came to slightly psychedelic, guitare-driven slow grunge witha an ear for melody, there were none better than Soundgarden.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki has had it rough with American audiences.  The master director has only been glimpsed briefly by American movie-watchers once or twice in the nineties.  However, he did manage to secure a somewhat small stateside followings with the releases of &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; speckled throughout the nineties.  Finally, he has received the ultimate recognition that he has had coming in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;<br /><br />  Now, for those of yout oo lazy to read the back of the DVD here's how the story goes.  Chihiro is a little girl who is at a very odd point in her life; her family is moving to a new town.  On the way, her family decides to take a detour and winds up in a strange land that her father dimisses as an amusement park gone under.  However, night falls and the place comes to life.  Spirits of all shapes and sizes start emerging from the woodwork.  Chihiro is frightened for her life, tires to get away, but can't when she realizes her parents have been turned to pigs.  A benevolent spirit, Haku, helps her out by getting her into the Bath House of the Gods, the property of one evil witch named Yu-Baba.  She gives Chihiro a job, but takes her name as colateral, giving her the suffix &quot;Sen.&quot;  From here she learns about herself in an alien, yet familiar, world populated by gods.<br />  The story is very much similar to the works of Lewis Carrol, but works on a more Eastern way of thinking.  The spirits presented here are mainstays in Shinto folklore.  In this, Miyazaki provides the viewer with a world so far into the imagination yet at the same time, hitting close to home.  It's a sense of creativity in something that has been around for eons that makes them wonderous.  The spirits/gods/kame are infinitely more enjoyable than any deity that has come across Western screens.  From the spider-like Kamaji, to the inky No-Face, and (my personal favorite) the oozing Mud God.<br />  The characters are much like Miyazaki's other movies.  His traditional heroine who grows strong through out the movie, and the wonderous side characters that support her.  Each character is used for all intents and purposes.  Not a single character wastes screen time.  If you've ever seen a Miyazaki film, you know these characters are easy to relate to and fun to love.<br />  The music is everything I would expect from a Ghibli film.  Hisaishi Joe has been conducting for twenty years and shows no sign of losing his touch.  His melodies are a mix of emotions that add onto the action on screen.<br />  The animation is gorgeous.  There is no doubt about that, Miyazaki's films always have an aura of perfection, especially in the art and animation department.  Even his older works like &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; age better than most anime their time period.  The whole world in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; looks like one gigantic, colorful portrait.  Key word; Beautiful.<br />  In the end, I really can't stop praising this film enough.  The fact that it garnered the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature should do more service to the film than I could.  I can finalize this all by saying that &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is the best film you can buy for yourself, your loved one, or your whole family.  With something for everyone this film proves once and for all, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a master of anime.<br />-RWod.<br />  The characters are much like Miyazaki's other movies.

B0000035E7|4.0|It's no wonder Bleach wasn't quite as succesful as Nevermind, but this not to say that what we have here is a brilliant rock album and a msut have for any grunge/alt.rock fans. There is no &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; here, but most of the songs display enough melody to keep taunting you after trhe lsitening experience. For some alt.rock fans Bleach might actaully be more entertaining to listen to compared to Nevermind, since this is not quite as clean-cut or radio-friendly produced as Nevermind.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn's at his swashbuckling best in a breathtakingly restored ROBIN HOOD, the cream of the crop in a Warner Brothers DVD set that also includes a grizzled, paranoid Humphry Bogart in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and a dancing Jimmy Cagney in the patriotic George M. Cohan biopic YANKEE DOODLE DANDY.<br />Robin Hood (1938) was originally directed by Bill Keighley and replaced by Michael Curtiz.  The romantic action adventure of the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest who rob the rich and aid the poor also stars Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian.  She has terrific screen chemistry with Flynn, who  got away with wearing green tights and a feather in his cap while not becoming  a joke.  (Kevin Costner in the inferior remake refused to wear tights and still became a joke.)<br />The two disc set is loaded with extras.  The magnificent score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold (Austria's &quot;second Mozart&quot;) can be enjoyed in isolation. And there's a dense, amusing commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer that alone is worth the price.
B000008LIX|5.0|Therapy? remains as one of the most underrated bands of the past 20 years. They have maintained a high quality in their music throughout thier existance. This is not to say that Troublegum in particular is an underrated piece of music since it is their most succesful album. The point here is that Therapy? has created so much great music in the lasdt 10 yeras that the fact that Troublegum remains as their most appreciated album tells a lot about the quality of this seminal masterpiece.<BR>Every household should own this album. If you own Nevermind, you should also own this one.
B000066NW0|1.0|Why you ask? Because Avril is the most talentless, fake, lying, disgusting being to ever step foot on this planet, and this is not exaggeration. One thing I hate about her, is how she claims and takes all of the credit off of her album, when she didn't take part of any of it, she is only doing it to look &quot;original&quot; so people will buy her albums and support her. I don't actually own this CD, but I downloaded all of the songs to put truth into my statement. Avril doesn't write her songs, she CO-writes them, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, and then she tries to tell people that she wrote &quot;Sk8 Boi&quot; on the piano. ::rolls eyes:: Who would you believe, the lying kunt? Or a legalized document indicating that Avril didn't write her own songs? Avril doesn't know how to read music (and who ever doesn't has NO business in the MUSIC industry), she claims to play the guitar, when the only chord I have seen her play is the G chord, not to mention she posed in shots with a guitar holding it the wrong way, and have you seen the pitiful music sheets? All of the music (that she did not write) is pathetic, and basic, into which anyone can learn how to play in less then two minuets. I also have came to a theory that her producers use technology in the album, videos, and the radio on her voice, any moron can hear the difference between her voice on the album and in live performances (which are so off key, and disgusting, I can't put into words how horrible it is). Avril has NO talent, and probably never will at this rate, since she continues to lie about her talent ability, instead of actually getting off her lazy ass and trying to do something for her career, instead letting her producers try and maintain her very short career as long as possible. It's just disgusting to see someone so talentless getting signed, WHEN I KNOW PEOPLE, who could defeat, and chop off Avril's head at ANYTHING musical, not to mention the other musicians out there who deserve more recognition thenher, who actually have worked for their careers. ::sigh:: I seriously hope this trend will be over, so I we won't have to deal with this ignorant chaunvestic pig anymore.
B000067DNC|5.0|StarGate is still one of my favorite shows. But don't confuse &quot;letterboxed&quot; with &quot;wide-screen&quot;. I've been watching SG-1 since it first started on Showtime. It wasn't produced in wide-screen, so it wasn't &quot;broadcast&quot; in wide-screen. The current letterbox fad is nothing more than that--a bar at the top and a bar at the bottom of a full-screen format, chopping off the top and the bottom of the original picture to make it look like a wide-screen format. You're actually losing original content.  That, however, doesn't change the quality of the show itself; it's still great.  The DVDs are excellent in both picture and sound quality.
B000002UZ1|5.0|My parents bought this collection (on twin cassettes) along with the 1962-1966 collection for me for Christmas when I was 12. <br />Having just watched the Beatles Anthology on DVD, I was inspired to purchase the CDs. Although I have all the songs elsewhere on other compilations or albums, this collection is a great start for youngsters sampling the Beatles for the first time, or for anyone over 30 who has been asleep for the last 33 years since they broke up.
B00005JM02|5.0|Another production from Pixar and they have not disappointed me yet. Animation was wonderful and seamless. The graphics are quite stunning to be fact.<br />The story about clown fishes. One a father called Marlin who has an only son called Nemo, who happens to be some sort fin crippled. The mother and the rest of his Nemo's siblings died when Marlin and her were looking for a place to live from the start of the movie itself.<br />It's the first day of school for Nemo and Marlin has become one over protective father. He walked...err swims Nemo to school, and yet on Nemo's first class, which happens to be also having a trip out into the ocean, gave Marlin a fright of his life and he decided to tail along. Once Nemo realized this, he becomes [upset] with his dad and decided to show him how much he has grown up and swims up to the bottom of a boat and touches it. Marlin, who is very furious, is telling him to come back down to the ocean floor. A human diver came along and takes Nemo with him.<br />So, the adventure starts from here. Will Marlin ever find his son again?
B000089RVX|5.0|I mean this only fully respectfully, but this chick has got a set of PIPES on her!!! What range - she can purr like a kitten, and rage like a lion...WOW!!!<br />The vocals aren't the only attraction here, as the guitars, bass and especially the drums are seriously chunky...the guys in the band have got chops!!!<br />The lyrics tend towards the darker side of things, but the music is a nice mixture of straight ahead of kick-ass rockers, power ballads and ethereal melodies...even the recording engineer did a phenomenal job, as the sound mix is awesome...<br />Not a weak track on the disc!!! It's gonna be TOUGH to beat this one, and Evanescence has their work cut out for 'em - how do you top this????
B0000B1OFN|5.0|Although it bares little resemblance to the original. This was a masterpiece. It has all the makings of what a good movie should be. Great directing,excellent cast,terrific plot. And the wonderful car chase scenes. I haven't seen a movie this good since the remake of Ocean's Eleven. Add this to your DVD library.
B000069AUI|5.0|After their highly successful Parachutes album, Coldplay followed up with an even better album.  Many people liked the slow, mournful alternative music that Coldplay created, and with A Rush of Blood to the Head, they perfected that sound.  <br />It's as if they took the slightly acoustic-sounding guitars and piano and just added clever beats and amped the overall rhythm up tremendously.  The lyrics are perfectly spaced out for the tremendous talent of Chris Martin, and while the songs are somewhat predictable, they are not like anything I've heard before.  Originality is a plus.<br />Some of the songs are true classics, such as &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;In My Place&quot;.  And others are silent, powerful thrillers like &quot;Politik&quot;.  I personally also like the guitar stylings featured on &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|All I will say is that this could be the most exciting rock and roll debut since Definitely Maybe.  Thomping rock of AC/DC and early Rolling Stones, soaring Oasis-like ballads (take some notes Noel) and working class grit of The Faces.  What a solid offering.
1878424319|5.0|Using and applying these four agreements has improved my relationship with myself and others. I highly recommend them to anyone drawn here. The work is powerful yet simple, beautiful in its simplicity, and washes away emotional pain like the ocean sculpts the shoreline. Another book that I recommend is &quot;he never called again.&quot; These two books helped me change my life.
B000002JS6|5.0|Rock broke the mold with this album/CD. I first heard this when it was on vinyl back in 1980. We all knew, deep down in our bones, that were witnessing magic. Twenty-odd years later, it's obvious we were right. Compared to the crap called rock today, this CD is incredible. These guys today playing &quot;heavy&quot; rock are missing the one important thing that matters most-hooks! It's all about the songs, folks. None of AC/DC would win awards for being great musicians. But they perform enertaining music that &quot;sticks to your ribs&quot;. They are The Beatles of hard rock! <BR>Every song here is a winner. Not to endorse drinking, but try not to slam a beer if this CD is playing! If you can, my hat's off to you. Own this piece of history!
B00009L1UP|5.0|In the summer of 1990, when &quot;Last Time in Paris&quot; (a soundtrack song included here as a bonus cut) was released to radio, fans of the group wondered if they could repeat the cult success they had with the concept-record, 'Operation: Mindcrime' (1988).  We were pleasantly suprised a few weeks later when the title track to this commercial breakthrough record hit the airwaves.<br />1. Best I Can.  Although the lyrics are a bit on the pedestrian side (i.e., about a wheelchair bound individual seeking inspiration), this is a musically powerful opening track.<br />2. The Thin Line.  This is one of the best-sounding tracks the band has ever produced as well as one of their strongest love songs.  Why this was not chosen as one of the many singles is beyond me.<br />3. Jet City Woman.  Although this is another love song and one of the two mega-successful singles, it has a narrative quality that was (is) unique for its time.<br />4. Della Brown.  Over a previously uncharacteristic jazz-like jam, Geoff Tate relates a poignant narrative about a homeless woman.<br />5. Another Rainy Night.  Along the same musical/lyrical lines as &quot;Jet City Woman&quot;, this was another semi-successful power ballad.<br />6. Empire.  As with all highlights of the rock genre in general, the title track is a musical juggernaut and a lyrical social indictment, and it has remained a mainstay in the live sets for good reason.<br />7. Resistance.  The opening track on the supporting tour, this is another call-to-arms social commentary rocker, as with &quot;Empire&quot;.<br />8. Silent Lucidity.  If you never heard this highly-orchestrated piece about the lighter side of dreamland (see &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; by Metallica for the darker side), then you have been living under a rock.<br />9. Hand On Heart.<br />10. One and Only.  If there is any filler on this record, it is &quot;Hand on Heart&quot; and &quot;One and Only&quot;, which are inferor takes cut from the mould of (and thus, superfluous to) &quot;Jet City Woman&quot; and &quot;Another Rainy Night&quot;.<br />11. Anybody Listening?  As was correctly noted above, this tune is, thematically speaking, Queensryche's &quot;Limelight&quot;, but instrumentally a much lusher picture than the Rush classic and one of the highpoints on the record.<br />Among the b-sides not already mentioned is a rather (over-)dramatic cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; (actually recorded during the 'Rage for Order' (1986) sessions) and another rather forgettable studio track that has not appeared, &quot;Dirty Lil' Secret&quot;.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I had not seen The Lion King in several years, and then, only on the inferior VHS version...What an amazing improvement!  The sound blew me away!  The color was so beautiful, I couldn't take my eyes away. It really gave me the chills.  My five year old, though, was a little frightened by the sound and the scene at the end where the hyenas attacked Scar.  She kept asking if there were hyenas here and did they eat people.  Of course, she loved Pumba and Timon.  I think it is a beautiful work of art, and this edition displays it brilliantly!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I dont understand how ppl dont/didnt like Reloaded...??  I did'nt say LOVE, i only said Like.  <br />First off, i am willing to pick on anyone's brains willing to tell me what THEY think the MATRIX is..??  What is the matrix?  U think u know it...  think again!  I thought i figured the insides and out of matrix, but i was dead wrong!  Reloaded was perfect sequel....  this generation of movie-goers HAS to move away from watching dead-beat action with no purpose...  Reloaded was perfect, in the sense that it essentially said &quot;relax....  we know that u wanna see action... we know that u know that ANYTHING is possible in action scenes....  lets just enjoy the character and plot development for a bit b4 we dwell into the action&quot;.  I dont even know how deep the rabbit hole goes, or if IT IS even a rabbit hole after seeing the flick.... essentially making this a perfect &quot;glue&quot; between 1 &amp; 3.<br />To guys that didnt like Reloaded, here is my question - will u watch revolutions (part 3)?  If u answered Yes - u essentially are looking for excuse not liking part 2?  B/c i can guarantee u, i never watched ANY sequel beyond part 2 if it didnt tickle my fantasies.  <br />Bottomline - Try to think occasionally when u go to movies, instead of watching mindless action.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie is not given the credit it deserves.  Yes maybe there are problems with the plotlines and some of the character development isn't that good, but overall I think this movie is an amazing visual experience.  I think the Wachowski Brothers propelled action and visual effects to a new level.  The directors were not afraid to push boundaries even if it alienated audiences, which is something I respect.  I also loved the symbolic references to comicbooks and anime.  Even if people were not happy with the movie they should still respect the amount of work that went into it, because all of the action scenes and visual effects put into the movie required alot of elaborate and technical work to pull off.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Reloaded is a continuation of the first movie not a sequel, just like the Godfather part 2 was a continuation of the first.  This is just the middle part of one story so treat it as such.  In this movie things are escalating and while some questions are answered new ones are asked.  And to those of you asking when did neo start doing the superman thing, watch the end of the first one again (then proceed to smack yourself in the forehead and utter DUH!).
B00009V7P8|3.0|Im not saying this record is good or bad but its just not for everybody. Damien Rice is good at what he does- the intimacy of Dylan, the emotion of Jeff Buckley and the sleaziness of Lou Reed all rolled into one sandwich.Maybe I should give this album more than 3 stars but being more of a rock fan i need something more epical and energetic than this. He's got buckets of songwriting and performing potential to be a legend but maybe he should consider plugging in his guitar now and again.
0792833201|5.0|You see I don't understand why people think that the older horror flicks can't be scary anymore. It doesn't make sense considering that most new horror flick stink. The little teenage girls and boys watch psycho and laugh at it, because it's old and there parents said it was scary, and yet they turn around and say movies like They and Feardotcom are scary. No sorry people those flicks aren't scary. Poltergeist is one of those horror gems that seem to be loosing respect. Believe me this is a truly scary movie, but it also tells a story and has spectacular acting, some great humor, and lots of scares and suspense. The film is about a haunted suburban tract home in a development very much like the Arizona one in which Spielberg was raised. Spielberg also cowrote the screenplay, which taps into primal, childlike fears of monsters under the bed, monsters in the closet, sinister clown faces, and all manner of things that go bump in the night. At first, some of the odd happenings in the house are kind of funny and amusing, but they grow gradually creepier until the film climaxes in a terrifying special-effects extravaganza when 5-year-old Carole Anne is kidnapped by the spooks and held hostage in another dimension, and then the psychological horror stuff happens. You feel like these people are like you, and they seem just like your next door neighbors.While it's not nearly as frightening as Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the original Nightmare on Elm Street, Poltergeist is one of the smartest and most entertaining horror pictures of its time, and remains one of the scariest movies ever made. Watch it alone in the dark, and do yourself a favor, take it seriously, I mean what's the point of watching a scary movie if your just gonna make fun of it and laugh at. Try sitting down and doing that with Saving Private Ryan, and you'll see that an event that was horrifying and horrendous can be the funniest experience of a life time. To enjoy a movie you must view it as it was meant to be viewed, this is a horror flick, and it was meant to scare you. Don't expect anything, just watch with an open mind. I love this flick and I want everyone else to enjoy it as much as I did.meant to be viewed, this is a horror flick, and it was meant to scare you. Don't expect anything, just watch with an open mind. I love this flick and I want everyone else to enjoy it as much as I did.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Animation films are incredibly tricky.  Adults(or just mainly uptight people view animated films as kids only.  However kids see them as great pieces of film that they &quot;get&quot;.  For once, Disney gets it right.  This was really a powerhouse film when it came out and held the record for the biggest animated film of all time(until recently when a so-so film about finding a fish called Nemo came out).  <br />Simba is a young lion in the Serengeti(they call it the Pride Lands though) who just can't wait to be king.  However, he's a mischievous little cub who gets into trouble a bit easy.  When a terrible tragedy strikes, Simba exiles himself where he meets a warthog and meerkat and develops a carefree lifestyle.  Now an adult, he returns to the Pride Lands to reclaim the throne from his evil uncle, Scar.<br />Sounds a bit like Hamlet huh? But you won't care.  Many impossibly catchy songs, funny moments and jokes and words that even appeal to adults(do you really think a kid would understand &quot;illustrating the differences in your royal mangerial approaches&quot;? Exactly.)  <br />Voice acting is top notch, animation is absolutely gorgeous, and it's done by hand by the way, none of that Finding Nemo/Toy Story/A Bug's Life CGI stuff.  There's a reason why this is considered the best Disney film but you owe it to yourself to find out why.
B00006ZSAD|3.0|when i heard my favourite female singer had paired with talk talk's paul webb aka mate rustin, mixed by the ole hipster who juggled together the glorious 'spirit of eden', i thought what more to ask for. anyone who's seen beth live will agree this woman shines oh so bright, and paul webb is a true craftsman, but sadly 'out of season' is more than disappointing to my subjective ears. not that i rushed to hear another portishead release, but with beth and 'spirit of eden' in my mind, i expected nothing less than a 21st century soul milestone. why it can't continue as beautifully as the first track, is a 'mystery' to me. it coulda bin a contender..............
B000066NW0|3.0|avril's music isn't that bad, but avril herself is the most annoying POP star not rock star, not punk rocker (well maybe punk rock waannabe) but POP star, existing. her oh i'm so punk airs are ridiculus. the music itself, except for complicated and sk8er boi ( i haven't seen a 18 yr old write like that for a while) is ok. losing grip and unwanted are someut heavy songs ( as far as pop goes) that have some sort of musical quality, too much to ask and naked are almost as good as a vanessa carleton type song, anything but ordinary has a good tune but the lyrics are wut could be called 'poser lyrics'. nobodys fool has a good message but wuts with avril rapping? tomorrow is actually the kind of song i like. its not rock or anything but its somewut touching. <BR>too bad she didn't write all these songs.<BR>oh and she doesn't play the guitar. its just a commercial act.
0676973779|3.0|When I first heard about Life of Pi I couldn't conceive of how the author would work the story out in a believable way ... a young man adrift with a Bengal tiger.  I thought \\"Ha! he'd last about 5 minutes.\\"  The way that Martel works it out seemed completely brilliant, and I loved the book. I would have given it 5 stars without question.<br />Then someone asked me if I had read Moacyr Scliar's book, \\"Max and the Cats.\\"  I got a copy and read it.<br />It's a clever, well told tale and quick read. And now I'd say Yann Martel owes an equal portion of the Man Booker Prize to Moacyr Scliar. The latter provides not only the fruit of an idea, but the very architecture for Martel's story. In a way, I'm disappointed. I was left wondering where inspiration leaves off and plagiarism begins. I thought \\"Life of Pi\\" was a truly original and inspiring story ... now I find that it wasn't.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I am docking one star for this, I'm suprised myself, but for two good reasons. Overall the movie was good, the philosophy blew my mind when I saw it, can't wait to get the DVD to understand abit more of it. As for the plot and such,well here are my two cents about that...<br />First of all the movie overall has a different feel to me, I walked out of it feeling utterly strange, it's long for one, but there have been a few things that changed. It doesn't feel quite like the same to me, but no sequel DOES feel the same does it? It's based four years or so after The Matrix, After Neo joined with Morpheus and Trinity, and now the real fight is starting to heat up with the machines. We learn much more about Zion and about the Matrix world as a whole, it isn't just focused on Neo or The One anymore, now it's showing a slightly bigger challenge, a bigger picture of the way things are outside of the matrix and in.<br />Second of all, as for plot and scenes go, ONE scene made me say \\"Oh my goodness...\\" My friends and I were wanting it to end but instead it went on for ten minutes or so, I was just sitting there in shock. I never thought I'd see a scene such as the 'rave' scene as I call it, with Neo and Trinity getting down right there in The Matrix, I expected if anything happened it would be a bit more tasteful than this. There have been other movies with far shorter scenes than that. This is the main reason I've docked a star. To me, this hasn't any place in the Matrix, if you ask me it was just a cheap shot scene to get people to watch the movie abit more. If this scene had been more tasteful, much shorter and less... strange... I would have given this a full rating.<br />Overall this was a great movie, in terms of plot and scene it could have had a bit better, I hope the third does not disappoint me any more than these slight problems did. Movies do NOT need something dealing with sexual acts EVERY time it's a rated R movie people! This has just proven my theory that most R rated films today do have SOME sexual interaction in them, but this was too much for this genre of film and the subject of the film.<br />If you are a fan of The Matrix saga it's great, if you aren't that big of a fan perhaps rent it first.<br />All for now...
0345446798|5.0|This book is a fairly serious academic work that doesn't act like one - it's funny and interesting, even to non-PhD types.  It is not a training manual but it gives training tips that seem to work almost instantly because you finally understand how to connect with your dog.  It is very well-written and enjoyable to read - I learned so much about dogs, and animal behavior in general.  This is a great book - I highly recommend it.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|\\"Worldwide Underground\\" is a great party album. <BR>It's highly groove-based. I love \\"Back In The<BR>Day\\" the most but all the other are hot too. I<BR>can't wait to take this cd when I drive home for<BR>the holidays.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Well, it is difficult to keep the mistery in the second one when you try to set the stage on the first one. The directors said that. The second one will be all about action and might be disappointed for some of the audience.<br />The problem people ahs some time is not to wait until seeing the third one. A trilogy is good or bad on its whole. If you just think that the Matrix reloaded is one movie, you have to realize that this cannot be. The directors at first wanted to release one movie out of three but the producers said that a 8-hour movie is not acceptable. <br />The \\"chemistry\\" thing is also an easy critics, I think. The matrix is not about emotions, it is about reading abook that is open for you. Who cares about the love story between Reeves and Moss. The point is that they are in love and that is important for the movie but seeing them having sex is really not my cup of tea, I would rather watch other movies for that.<br />As French, I apreciate how the audience react when the guy swore in French.... This is pretty funny.<br />I overall enjoyed the movie and enjoy all movies that are a little bit whaco anyway.<br />Matrix for me is so far a success and can't wait for the third one.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Paul Buchanan, lead singer and songwriter for The Blue Nile, sings like a wounded sparrow. There is such a fragile tensility that you expect him to break apart at any moment, at the same time you know with absolute certainty that he won't. \\"Hats\\" is an album that is in love with its subject and can't escape its own gorgeous abyss of urbane sadness. It is the kind of album that will have you seeing the dampness as it gathers around lonely after-hours street lights, wondering why the unexplained tears are welling just beneath the cool of your eyes and the tremble of your chin.<br />\\"Each time I fall for you, it hurts me a little bit more than I want it to.\\" So Buchanan emotes from the lonely morning of \\"Seven A.M.\\" It helps to listen to \\"Hats\\" with the lights low, to absorb the richness of the sound that surrounds the tortured beauty of The Blue Nile's world. There is the plea of \\"Let's Go Out Tonight,\\" which could be easily sung to a moribund partner just as it could to the desperate soul who knows that the only thing waiting outside for him is more emptiness.<br />It's a perfectly ironic counterpoint that, swelling and building under and around all the songs on \\"Hats\\" is a shimmering sound that so many others have striven to find and so few have ever put to tape. It's the kind of sound that makes the \\"Blue\\" in the band's name so apt, as well as making this a \\"headphones only\\" kind of listening disc. Just don't let that stop you from allowing this river of sound to fill your room. For many of the same reasons I will always have copies of both Roxy Music's \\"Avalon\\" or Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\", The Blue Nile's \\"Hats\\" is on my desert island disc list.
0316666343|2.0|The book starts out as an exciting murder mystery, but ends like a V.C. Andrews book. Sebold is skilled at developing characters, but about half way through the book the plot starts to get out of hand and it is impossible to continue to suspend disbelief. The reader can't help but be conscious of the writing instead of captured by it. For example, the characters in Susie's heaven are barely described at all. However, we're told that Susie's roommate, has nicknamed herself \\"Holly\\" from \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", but we're never told why or what her real name was and we do not know how Holly died. There is no Christmas in heaven and very little joy or peace. When a member of her family dies, Susie isn't given a chance to meet up with this family member because this person is too busy visiting with their favourite dead celebrities. Give me a break - a family member would definitely be more interested in meeting up with their 14-year old murdered relative than Hollywood's dead. Heaven isn't a happy place and seems to be a waiting place -- although what she is waiting for is never touched on. Susie doesn't seem interested in forming any bonds with her friends in heaven. This is unrealistic, as you'd think she would want to make friends and form new bonds and perhaps figure out a little bit more about the meaning of life. Also, Susie's \\"final performance\\" at the end is troubling and very unbelievable. If Susie was given a chance to return to earth, I would think she'd want to confront her murderer or find a way to give her grieving family some comfort instead of what does comes about. While the premise of the book was interesting, I found it to be too syrupy and unrealistic. It goes so so so wrong that I can't even pinpoint what exactly happened that sidetracked the great beginning.  Did Sebold just get carried away? I thought there might be a great ending to make up for the odd way the story develops, but there wasn't.  It just got even more strange to the point of silliness.ess.
0684801558|3.0|My thoughts of: The Beautiful and the Damned<br /> The Beautiful and the Damned, by F.Scott Fitzgerald, is an exciting novel that brings friendship. Love, and confusion of young life all together. \\"here eyes were gleaming ripples in the white lake of her face; the shadows of her hair bordered the brow with a persuasive unintimate dusk.\\" The author clearly tries to describe the joy and sorrow of finding a new love throughout this novel. Fitzgerald shows the ups, downs, confusions, and oddness of how love begins, lingers, and in some cases, ends.<BR> Anthony Patch begins as a young, well educated, and wealthy man. He acts like a regular young man, engaging in drinking, associating with peers, and finding love. He stumbles upon love through a friend, Richard Caramel, an interesting author. Richard's cousin, Gloria, is an attractive young lady who sparks a flame in Anthony's eyes almost instantly. They create what may be love but gradually realize that alcohol and greed soon replaces it all.<BR> The setting of this novel seems perfectly fit for the story. It switches from one impressive city to the next, Boston and New York City. A big city naturally puts these characters into play. The activities they persue, and every young person dreams of, fall snuggly into Boston Massachusetts and New York City. Dancing, dining out, and drinking, done so often they become almost as natural as breathing, all activate their fancy high life. <BR> The characters in this novel bring back the old fashioned yet, somehow, modern ways of the young. The protagonist, Anthony Patch, signifies a highly opinionated person which shows throughout the story as he places himself in deep discussions with Gloria, the antagonist. The deep discussions also occur with Maury and Richard, some of their closest companions. Maury and Richard both get along great, but they characterize very different people. For instance, Richard loves writing. Writing almost addictively, searching for a new character to create always stays on his mind. Maury, a lot like Anthony, stands as an opinionated person who gives the two much to talk about, which only adds more interest to the story. Gloria conversates as well, but mostly about things only appealing to her. Gloria presents what Anthony and Maury call a \\"childish\\" kind of glow. Though she seems childish, this feature actually attracts people to her the most. All the characters play an interesting and important role in this book.<BR> The Beautiful and the Damned, definitely worth reading, shows the realism of everyday life in the 1920's. F.Scott Fitzgerald portrays the life of the young and how easily it might self destruct through greed, material wants, and alcoholism. Fitzgerald proves that the fairytale of married life among the wealthy rarely happens. Money, though abundant, possibly means a lack of love and other ingredients that fuel a healthy life. Money turns into the only reason Gloria stays with Anthony. Though this book may seem fantasy-like at first, it breaks through the candy coated appearance of wealthy life in the early 1920's

0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones reminds me of an &quot;I see dead people. . .&quot; version of something Anne Tyler would write.  Although the subject is disturbing, it is approached gently.  Alice Sebold writes a compelling story with a compassionate take on &quot;what happens after&quot; &amp; alongside.

B000089RVR|4.0|So I've already had 3 friends say, &quot;it sounds just like the first record.&quot; Well I have 5 Sade albums and they all sound like, guess who, Sade. I have 5 Natalie Merchant cd's and they all sound like, guess who, Natalie Merchant. Point taken? That an artist establishes a sound that is recognizable as theirs is not a criticism in my book but a testament to their artistry. LIFE FOR RENT is a stunning and supieror follow up to Dido's debut &quot;No Angel.&quot; The lyrics are more mature and world weary. &quot;See You When You're Forty&quot; is the benchmark by which all other Dido songs will be measured. &quot;Sand in my Shoes&quot; and &quot;Stoned&quot; are ready for remixing and the radio. Dido's voice is pure and she stays in her range like all good pop singers (a la Sade and Tracey Thorn from Every But the Girl).  If you want a risk taker listen to Peaches &quot;Father F**ker's&quot; but if you want something sensational and smooth get &quot;Life for Rent.&quot;
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Finally, Maiden come out with an album that surpasses 7th Sun and takes it's rightful place where Piece of Mind left off 20 years ago. With exception of weaker tracks Dance of Death, Face In The Sand &amp; Journeyman, the listener is left with 8 tracks that match the best of the band's original sound. &quot;Rainmaker&quot; is the springboard of the release, surpassing &quot;Wasted Years&quot; as the band's most sing-along anthem. &quot;New Frontier&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot; revel in their brilliance, even taking the listener back to the Killers/Beast sound with both songs' heavier passages. &quot;No More Lies&quot; has Harris finally getting the reflective look at life and possibility of being reborn lyrics right with a crushing groove, to boot. &quot;Age Of Innocence&quot; and &quot;Montsegur&quot; cement DOD's cannon, which of course begins with the wonderful time-waster &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;<br />After a lackluster, overly-melodic last three studio efforts, Maiden proves they've got the goods 25 years later....
B00005JKC3|3.0|I don't know why everyone hates \\"The Hulk\\" so much. Hulk was a pretty good movie. It was weird but it was pretty good. The story was good, the acting was good and the effects were (forgive the pun) incredible.<br />The Hulk was great to watch because we would all like to do what he does deep down when we are mad. It is a nice fantasy because we would all like to let go and show how we feel the way the Hulk does. The Hulk is a nice metaphor for the animal in all of us and the film is worth seeing since it makes you think of what it would be like to be more open with your feelings even if they may be dark in some way.<br />Nick Nolte is the only downer in this film. He goes too far with his odd performance. His fate is also sort of lame.<br />The Hulk is not the best comic book movie out there but it is worth your time if you like to think about the way that we face our Demons in the end.
B000002L68|5.0|Too often, we music fans are treated today to 70 minute (or more) bloated carcasses of albums that leave us longing for the days of this baby, a forty minute detour through perfection.  True, many artists today make longer albums to give fans more for their money, but I can count on one hand (with fingers to spare) the number of worthy 70 minute albums out there.  Who still doesn't love talking along to Prince's intro to &quot;Let's Go Crazy?&quot;  If you play this song at an 80's high school reunion, the place will go nuts!!  Prince himself has been known to be a little indulgent, but the stars were perfectly aligned when he made this one.  I still remember watching the movie and going right down the street to buy the album.  I don't know if I have done that since 1984!!
B000002JR8|3.0|Wow, this is pretty dissapointing when compared to their album &quot;Vulgar Display Of Power&quot;. I mean for me &quot;Vulgar Display Of Power&quot; was like in my top 5 favourite thrash albums of all time, the lyrics were top notch, the replay value was high, Dimebag Darrel(if thats how you spell it) chucked in great solo's in each song, Phil sang more, the drummer beated his drums with style.<br />But now look at this album, no more of Dimebag Darrels solo's, no more terrific songwriting e.g &quot;this love&quot;, singer basically raps now, drummer just beats the hell out of his drums with no care, low to medium replay value, bad remake of black sabbath song &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;.<br />Although this is Pantera's heaviest album, that certainly doesn't mean it's their best to me its their worst or second worst album. Like Slayer_Dude said which couldn't have been said better the first 4 songs are good however it goes all the way downhill until you reach the last track(planet caravan) which is the worst song on the album and the worst redo ever.<BR>All in all i recomend you get their album &quot;Vulgar Display Of Power&quot; and then get this album last out of all the pantera albums. I don't even know if this deserves 3 stars. Hope this helped.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|Ninja Scroll is among my favorite anime, so I eagerly awaited this release.  I'm pleased with it overall, but there are a few caveats I feel I should share.  First, there's only one disc, with the widescreen version on one side and the pan and scan on the other.  The widescreen version is actually the pan and scan with a bit off the top and bottom cut off.  I guess it's a boon if you have a 16:9 screen, but it kind of sucks to lose any of the picture.  Second, the remastered version isn't significantly better than the original release.  The video's a bit crisper, but nothing on the scale of, say, the most recent Akira DVD release or the Macross Box Sets.  If you just want a copy of Ninja Scroll, then get the older release and save yourself some cash.  If you're a sucker like me, and you have to own the best possible version of any given film, then I guess you'd better go ahead and order this one...
B00005JLZN|4.0|I thought this movie's topic was quite interesting, however at times i thought the acting was a bit stupid though the acting was overall good, though hasn't Kevin Spacey played the same role too many times.<br />David Gale(Kevin Spacey) plays as a death row convict with only 4 days to go until he is executed. David Gale agrees to spend 2 hours a day talking with reporter Bitsy Bloom(Kate Winslet) who is there to find out if he really did rape and murder his Death Watch partner Constance(Laura Linney). Bitsy is very sure David is innocent and she sets off seeking for proof that he did not rape while her cohortn intern reporter Zack(Gabriel Mann) pieces together the clues.<br />I thought the movie was great, the acting was overall well done. Kevin Spacey acted well as a man a ready to be executed and during the flashbacks of before he was convivted he acts well as a sad, depressed man who had just lost his wife, son and job as a philosophy teacher. The only time i thought his acting was silly was the scene were he is stumbling on streets talking to people about philosphy and trying to act drunk which he couldn't do, otherwise his acting was good.<br />I thought Kate Winslets acting as a reporter was silly seeming,she tried to have a good american accent, however failed and she always kept the same facial expression, apart from that her acting was fine or maybe a bit below fine.<br />The topic of the story was interesting, it was on capital punishment a very interesting topic for a film and i really like the twist at the end which raised my rating of 3 stars to 4 stars. The main thing that bothered me about this film is that it was a bit depressing, like i mean it would be pretty depressing to live a life like Kevin Spacey in the film and i found the scene were Kate Winslet and Gabriel Mann watch the tape pretty depressing, and i though it was a bit pointless how before the key flashbacks there would be quick cuts to words on paper in chalk boards(RAPE, REPUTATION, ACCUSATION, MURDER) and then the camera would spin. Pretty annoying bit of editing eh.<br />All in all, excellent topic, good acting, good story, excellent message.
0141180870|4.0|The Beautiful and Damned:<BR>A Look into the Elite <br />&quot;As you first see him he wonders frequently, whether he is not without honor and slightly mad.&quot; This type of confusion is typical when following the characters through their whirlwind lifestyles in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, the Beautiful and Damned. Fitzgerald portrays the rich and shameful through the eyes of one of New England's socialites. Fitzgerald holds nothing back when his characters come in contact with alcohol, nightlife, and women in 1910's New York. Having wealth doesn't always bring the happiness and comfort that every human needs and wants. <BR> The action begins by trailing Anthony Patch and his friends fresh out of Harvard. His social status comes from his grandfather, who was a big reformer back in the late 1850's. Anthony and his friends, Maury Nobel and Richard Caramel maintain a lifestyle of extravagant meals and lavish Broadway plays. Anthony's life suddenly takes a turn when he meets Gloria Gilbert. Soon after meeting her, he falls head over heels in love, then beginning a romantic journey with Gloria.  Anthony and Gloria finalize their love with marriage. The story unfolds through the trials and tribulations of marriage life for the two. <BR> The realistic setting of 1913's New York City and the Boston area is one of the most important elements of the book. The events that occur could only happen in the New York night life. Each character slowly realizes that they would never live anywhere else in world. Through the book, Anthony &quot;found himself thoroughly enjoying New York.&quot; Fitzgerald drew from his own experiences in New York, one of the most influential cities of the 1920's and 1930's. Some other major U.S. cities came into play for the happy couple on their honeymoon. They travel to places like &quot;Chicago, Hot Springs and the West.&quot; Without the setting the story would never work out the same. <BR> The protagonist, Anthony Patch is a tall and thin, 25 year old, meek and simple man, who aspires to be an aesthete. He also looks for love in the big city. Sure enough he finds it with Gloria Gilbert. After the honeymoon, he soon realizes that his new wife becomes dependent on material things. Anthony soon finds his life falling into a financial downward spiral. Gilbert, the antagonist, is a 22 year old free spirit coming from the mid-west. After marriage her true colors bleed through, making Anthony realize that she is not the woman he thought. Gloria realizes that he becomes boring to her and she doesn't love him, but she stays for the financial security. Maury Nobel and Richard Caramel are long time friends of Anthony. Richard, a best-selling author, feels much older than the others. He is a short, bald man. Maury, tall and thin, nervous man, meets his best friend at Harvard.<BR> The pace of the plot starts out slow, but then picks up. All the elements of the book come together very well. Fitzgerald takes the reader to 1913's New York to the life of Anthony Patch. His fast pace lifestyle reflects into his marriage, which is run by greed and alcohol. The plot moves smoothly and is simple to understand, which makes it easier to have fun reading this book. Fitzgerald's rendition of a new couple in a big city relates too much of the population. <BR> The type of language Fitzgerald use is sophisticated yet casual English. The diction shows the readers that both Fitzgerald and the characters of the novel have high levels of education. The language explains one of the most important factors in the book: money. &quot;A classic is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation,&quot; this quote is classic for some of the conversations between Maury and Anthony. The chance of higher education gives the characters multiple opportunities for a better life. <BR> The Beautiful and Damned depicts the stereotypical views of the wealthy not having problems when in fact they have many of the same problems as everyday, ordinary people.  When all the events of the book join together, it becomes a wonderful piece of literature. Some of other Fitzgerald's novels in include The Great Gatsby and This Side of Paradise. This book is beautifully written and very entertaining to read.
B000089RVR|4.0|Well, the sparse arrangements and great wordplay continue from the last release, even better in some spots.  Without an obvious radio-friendly release, it seems freer and yet still more introspective.  It's reminiscent of Norah Jones in a way, without sounding as lounge-y.
0440224764|5.0|In the book The Partner, the author John Grisham writes \\" Another scream filled the cabin.\\" This shows the horror and the pain the main character went through. The author's purpose in writing this novel is to grab the reader's attention and keep them in suspense. He does this by giving details on the setting, plot, characters, and language.<br /> This novel is about a lawyer, Patrick Lanigan, who fakes his death so he can steal his firms money. He steals ninety million dollars, he takes the money and runs to Brazil for four years. A bunch of people the firm hired to look for him are trying to catch him. The people final catch Patrick. They take him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere so they can torture him. When the FBI finally get him from the people the firm hired to catch him they keep him in a Puerto Rican military base.<br /> It all starts in Brazil. When the people the firm hired to catch him do, they take him to a cabin where there is no one around for miles. Eventually the feds catch him and take him to military base in Puerto Rico.<br /> There were a variety of characters in the book. All kinds from sneaky characters, Patrick Lanigan, to scared characters, Trudy Lanigan.<br /> The plot is explained by Grisham when Lanigan takes the money from the firm and runs off. He runs to Brazil and tells a lady to take the money and hide it and not to tell him where she has it hidden. When the antagonist finds him they torture him almost to death. The FBI trick the kidnappers into giving them Lanigan, and they torture him.<br /> The language Grisham uses is easy to follow and easy to understand. He uses figurative language and imagery. He writes using a mixture of all kinds of alliterations and allusions. He flows smoothly. He changes scenes in every chapter and sometimes every paragraph.<br />All these aspect of the novel and author make this fiction novel a great book to read. Grisham keeps the suspense going throughout the book. He keeps his audience on the edge of their seats and forces them to think. This is a great novel it will keep the reader wanting never to put it down.ats and forces them to think. This is a great novel it will keep the reader wanting never to put it down.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I don't often shower all the 5 stars in my reviews here at Amazon, but this precious film deserves 6!<br />An amazing star cast, a theme that will have you guessing until the end how all the entertaining but diverse vignettes are connected, some very mature and intelligent humour, and above all some enchantingly memorable and sincere dialog about life, relationships, love.<br />Mind you, none of the characters is in a simple straightforward predicament. Angelina Jolie especially pitches in an absolutely stunning performance, although everyone is convincing and memorable in their role.<br />What a cleverly crafted movie. You know the satisfaction you feel when you've just had a complete meal, that's what I'll bet you'll feel.<br />Highly recommended absorbing film, for *owning*, not just for seeing once. It's one of those.
B000001F45|5.0|This album is one of the all time greats. Uriah Heep are a much underrated band, mainly remembered in the US for one or two hits (ie Stealin' and Easy Livin') and for being one of the apparent main inspirations for Spinal Tap. But during the early 70's, they were one of the finest bands around. David Byron was one of the best rock vocalists EVER, second only to Freddie Mercury, while Mick Box cranked riffs and technically simply but effective solos. Ken Hensley played keyboards, played some of the more impressive guitar parts and also contributed a great deal of excellent songwriting to the band's repetoire. And Gary Thain and Lee Kerslake were one of the most solid rhythm sections around, combining Thain's melodic bass playing with Kerslake's workmanlike drumming. Oh, and everyone sang back up vocals (lest you should wonder where the great vocal harmonies on the record came from). <br />Every song on this record is a winner, from the opener Sunrise to the 10 minute title track finale. In between, a diverse array of tunes are encountered, from the hard rockin' boogie of Sweet Lorraine to the ballad Rain. Even the cover artwork (by the legendary Roger Dean, who had built up a reputation for doing artwork for many bands in England over the preceding few years, and was on the verge of beginning his decades long association with progressive rock giants Yes) is brilliant. <br />Unfortunately, it couldn't last. Gary Thain developed a serious drug problem, which led to him nearly being electrocuted onstage a few years later. He was kicked out of the band, and died of an overdose in 77. David Byron last two more albums, but was also booted from the group, for drinking too much. He went onto release a couple solo albums before dying in 1984. In 1980, Hensley left on his own accord, after disputes with John Sloman, the singer who had replaced John Lawton (who himself had replaced Byron). Without Byron's voice, Thain's bass, or Hensley's songwriting (and admittedly, Hensley seemed to run out of quality material a cuople albums before he left) Heep was never the same. Rest assured, we still have the classic early 70's albums. <br />My only caveat is that you get the mid 90's remaster (on Essential/Castle Recordings), which has two bonus tracks. One is a vocal track that never got finished, so it's presented as a rather dull karoake-style instrumental. The other bonus track, Crystal Ball, which is the only song credited solely to Gary Thain as a songwriter. It's a rough recording, with apparently just a guide vocal, but it's a good song, one worth hearing, especially in light of Gary's tragic demise. <br />Oh yeah, and the infamous Melissa Mills quote actually was &quot;If this band makes it, I'll have to commit suicide&quot;.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Yes, this is in fact a &quot;rock album&quot;.  Something that seems to have been often forgotten as of late by the jaded music industry that keeps heaping tablespoons full of sugary britney-pop on all of us.<br />Thirteenth step has 12 elaborate tracks that are tied together by a common theme, weaving this into a truly excellent rock album.<br />Favorites include Blue, Outsider and Gravity.  Even the weaker tracks on the album are great to listen to.<br />Put on a good set of headphones, cue this thing up and experience musical nirvana.
6305949980|5.0|And its success! This movie is a film for all ages! Its amazing animation style and wacky charichters really bring out Tim Burtons true Genious. The man is amazing and the fild really shows it. This film is great for kids and Adults alike. As for the person who wrote in their review &quot;jack is selfish throughout the movie and it gives the wrong message&quot; you need to really get a life. Kids today are way too soft, people like you are really knocking children into a corner. When i was a kid id sit down and watch Garfield tell me that whoever invented somthing that made him mad should be drug out into the street and shot id laugh. I wasnt about to go and get a gun. ITs just an expression. And i was raised to know that and to know better. If your kid is 100% influenced by tv then its your fault! Nightmare before X-mas is the Best movie that was ever created! Bar None!. Buy this film Now!, what are you waiting for, click order!.. Now!.. your still reading this..just order it!  cmon, you know you want to!  :P
B000084T18|1.0|Good god, this stammering monkey disgusts me. His image is pitiful and artificial- thug, hahaha, right, his voice is funny and monotonous, his songs less than average, his lyrics- a drunken bum could write something better. And yet, somehow, he makes millions of off his garbage-worthy cds. An oxi-Moron is what he is. A stammering monkey relying on sex and &quot;thug&quot; appeal to push his songs and records through. How does anyone even dare compare this imbecil to Tupac? Tupac is light years ahead of 50 cent in music. I just hope that 50 cent will stop coming out with this worthless albums soon, before my ears start bleeding from his idiocy. If he is the future of hip-hop, hip-hop sadly is doomed.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm don't usually purchase rock music but this CD sticks in my player (4 out of 5 I buy are country). Amy Lee has great vocals in every song. Going Under, Bring Me to Life, My Immortal &amp; Tourniquet are my favorites but there isn't a bad song on this CD. Reminds me of some of Annie Lennox from Eurythmics because I don't know Linkin' Park.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man, the Marvel Comics hero, has been adapted and changed for the big screen.  Peter Parker is an unassuming student who is smart, shy, and loves the girl next door (Mary Jane).  But a trip to Columbia University's science department changes his life.  There he is bitten by a genetically designed super spider.<br />The bite causes genetic changes in Peter and he becomes part spider.  At first he wants to use his new abilities to make money so he can impress Mary Jane.  But when his own spiteful inaction leads to the death of his uncle, peter decides to fight crime.<br />The movie does a nice job of setting the stage of the series while still brining in a super-villain.  In this film, the villain is The Green Goblin and his movie incarnation is nowhere near as silly as his comic book version.<br />Casting was well done for most of the cast.  Dunst manages to give some excellent Mary Jane smirks, the Osbornes actually look like they could be father and son and J. Jonah Jameson looks like he stepped right off the comic page.  But is they worked so hard on Jameson's look, why were there no widow's peaks for the Osbornes?<br />There have been changes to the character and story of Spider-Man.  Most notably, he actually generates webs (from his hands no less) so there will be no classic empty web-shooter plot twists.  Mary Jane is not killed off on the bridge as she was in the comics (an issue of What If showed just how horrible the world would become is Spider-Man succeeded in rescuing her).  We see how Peter's fingers can cling to the wall but, like in the comics, we still don't know how his shoes do it.<br />This is a fun film and if you can get past the fact that it is not the comic book you should enjoy it.  The only real flaws I saw were a few inconsistencies in scale during some of the CGI scenes (that and the total lack of concern on the part of the University when it is pointed out that there is a super-spider missing).
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I have always been a devout fan of Enigma as I tend to favor music styles such as ambient, new age, world, and music of the avant-guarde.  Enigma seems to be able to straddle both the edge of music while still allowing itself to be accessed by random listerners looking for something fresh and new.<br />So about VOYAGEUR, there are many mixed reactions so I decided to let the album grow on me for a week or so before writing anything.  Here are my thoughts:<br />Enigma has grown and moved away from silky ambient sampled themes and is marching toward a world beat mixed with an edgier rhythm and more diverse vocals.  A fantastic leap into something new for such an established project like Enigma.<br />The album opens up with a warm muted piano laced under soft sounds rushing suddenly with an urgent beat.  &quot;From East to West&quot;, the intro, may be the announcement that Enigma is about to move forward into the future.  Then in &quot;Voyageur&quot; a guitar plays while a strange meloncholy baseline meaders from nowhere.  Quivering sampled voices bring an eerie feel to the song.<br />&quot;Incognito&quot; comes on with a looped vocal with a steady beat and a far off male voice singing.  Next is an ode to a tarot card in &quot;The Page of Cups&quot; with sounds of birds and perhaps a far off boombox which is drowned away by slow beats of trance music.<br />&quot;Boum-Boum&quot; is most likely to be a single.  A sorta Euro-dance/outer space boogie with a female voice singing about longing so much her heart goes &quot;boum&quot;!  Suddenly a male voice responds and the beat is carried deeper.  A great track!  This song is begging to be remixed!!<br />&quot;Total Eclipse of the Moon&quot; brings some synth strings and classical tones and a beautiful song.  If you like Peter Gabriel, you will like this song!  A muted grinding rhythm finds itself a voice &quot;In the Shadow, In the Light&quot;.  Very understated...perfect!<br />The muted piano returns for an ambient dance sonata in &quot;The Piano&quot;.  Then the album finds fruition with &quot;Following the Sun&quot; a sweet musical number with both male and female vocals taking the album from start to finish...from east to west...following the sun...following the future.<br />Remember listening to the first Enigma CD and thinking &quot;this music is so on the edge and new&quot;?  Well listen to this with an open mind and you will be hearing again music that is new!<br />Enjoy this CD!nce sonata in &quot;The Piano&quot;.

B000002IZ4|5.0|What can I say about this CD that hasn't already been said? This CD is a must-have for any rock fan. And if you aren't a fan of rock, listen to this CD and you will be. STP is an amazing band and this is an amazing CD. If you don't have this CD (along with all their others!) get it. See them when you can in concert, as often as you can. They are one of the absolute best rock bands in history and always will be, period. LONG LIVE STP!!
B00008J2DQ|1.0|Godsmack represent everything that is wrong with the Rock scene today. What's scary is that this band is completely leeching their identity and musical direction from Alice In Chains and NO ONE is complaining. It is time for those that have a clue to call all the radio stations and tell the dj's to stop playing this uninspired, unimaginative, boring, and stunningly LAME music. Oh yeah...Godsmack wasn't obvioius enough to have album called &quot;Faceless&quot; so now they are going to fool all you suckers with an acoustic album in the vein of Jar of Flies.  In fact, the singer even praises himself for having written songs that are similar to Jerry Cantrell's. PLEASE....let us rise against this vacant band.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album haunts me.  How much more could I put it.  Gone are the slick productions and somewhat belting guitars of the previous album.  What comes forth is a very stripped down emotionaly charged piece of work, that sends the listener into places you fear to tread.<br />THe album seems to be somewhat conceptual about the madness of addiction and then finding redemption in the end.  There aren't a lot of songs to crank, but the most powerful and best work on the album is incredibly airy, atmospheric, and electricaly charged.<br />A haunting piece of work best put forth in tracks such as 'The Noose', 'Vanishing', 'A Stranger',  and 'Gravity'.
B0000640VO|1.0|That's what I kept thinking, almost from the beginning, of this weird movie.  It's not the subtitles--I loved &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;  There was something slightly depressing about the scenery and the dysfunctional people.  (I do think that Audrey Tautou is pretty adorable, however.)  I know it's supposed to be &quot;arty,&quot; but I just found it too difficult to follow--I was confused the entire movie.  Maybe I need to watch it again, but I just can't put myself through that.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of art work.  Thought provoking and incredibly more mature than their previous release, Thirteenth Step solidifies A Perfect Circle's position as one of the greatest bands of current times.  Many of the songs are much more mellow, but just as passionate as the work in Mer De Noms.  Maynard's vocals are just as haunting as ever.  Be sure to check out this amazing album.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Yeah i was harsh when i completely had a big go about these guys, they obviously have talent, it's just that i never really got into Nirvana, or any of that kind of vocal performance, so yeah it's gotta be 3 stars, cos i don't actually see it bein much more than an average album... once again you have to hear it to know if you like it, if this is your kind of music (RATM crossed with Sound Garden vocalist fused to make a commendable effort at a new sound) then by all means i advise you to perhaps give it a listen...
0822216310|3.0|I bought this compilation because after purchasing &quot;Strangers With Candy&quot; Season One on DVD, this kept showing up in my Amazon recommendations every day for over a month. I read the reviews, and decided it couldn't be that bad. It wasn't. It just wasn't that super, either. Sure, there are funny parts, and sure I could envision some of this on the stage, but the truth is that David Sedaris' storytelling is good but somewhat short of other NPR geniuses like Garrison Keillor. <br />I'll keep reading him, in search of the comedy stroke that so many others seem to have found, but I guarantee no milk was coming out of my nose while choking out laughter during this read. It kind of seems like the sort of writing a high school kid might do on a sitcom (the character Warren P. Chestwick from NBC's &quot;Ed&quot; comes to mind) to blossom his stage career, but it just doesn't hold up well on its own. Call me uncultured if you want, but I just don't think he's worth the salt of some of the other NPR favorites. But like I said, I'll keep reading.
B000050HTO|4.0|Yes the title says it all... i guess it's mainly for the people who like oldies, classic style music, it's alot lighter than anything these days, the man and his guitar take the stage. Not the most perfect vocalist we ever had, but a mind that scholars and critics alike still fumble to analyse, a good collection of this legend's best songs. If you're someone who gives music a chance really then get it, but if you're not and you just listen to something once and make your feelings known about how poor it is, then why bother? Everyone knows he's a legend, but you have to give everything a chance....
B00005U18E|5.0|_Bridget Jones's Diary_ was a very funny book and it makes a very funny movie. Renee Zellweger has been making movies for a decade but only recently has she begun to hit the Big Time. She certainly hits the mark here as a lovable, loopy Londoner in her thirties (same age as the actress) who is trying to deal with the prospect of spinsterhood. Whatever comes into her mind is likely to come right out her mouth without traveling by way of her brain, and Zellweger comic sense makes the most of the opportunities. She has a real sense of visual comedy, mugging without quite seeming to and performing pratfalls that seem almost unstudied. Though a Houston native, she also manages a respectable Brit accent. Hugh Grant plays a somewhat slimy &quot;Hugh Grant&quot; character with his usual disreputable charm, and Colin Firth plays a stiff, haughty barrister who is drawn to Bridget against his better judgment. Gemma Jones, of whom I have long been a fan, is terrific as Bridget's dissatisfied Mum who leaves her husband for the Shopping Channel. The whole film is a hoot and a half.
B000066NW0|2.0|I think this is something that females like more than males, the collection of catchy tunes and softer songs, doesn't really appeal to us that much, but i can say it gets at least 2 stars, which isn't saying it's bad, i just don't plan on giving 5 stars to an album unless i believe it's going to be around and stick from now on (ignore any previous 5 star reviews that was me going a bit overboard)... lol she's still worth a listen as is all music... you don't know if you like it until you hear it more than once i do believe... :D
B00005JKZV|3.0|Until I saw the preview for the Special Extended Edition.  These things that were added almost make the way that Merry and Pippin &quot;trick&quot; the Ents forgivable.  There seemed to be a missing quality here in this movie, like we weren't seeing what it really was.  It just moved too fast with too little tie-in material, and from the looks of the longer edition, they've finally put together the movie that should have hit theaters.  I hope that they run the extended editions in the theaters prior to the release of &quot;Return of the King&quot; instead of the original theatrical releases.  With the extra material from these, it makes the movies tie together better and doesn't give it the jumbled, hurried pace that it seems to have.
B000094DUP|3.0|Middle of the road, some good songs, some annoying ones, i can't listen to this whole album all at once, but it's ok, there's a large bunch of piano vocalist artists coming through, she's ok, not the best i've heard though, also though give her a listen if you're into piano powered pop ballads...
B00005GL0K|5.0|This, of course, is the Beatles' first album.  What a debut!  Eight great original songs and six fantastic covers.  From Paul's &quot;1, 2, 3, 4!&quot; countoff, to the closing guitar chords, there is never a dull moment.  I could say more, but so much has already been written about the Beatles.  Just buy it already!
B00008J4P5|4.0|I think we've been missing classic rock for a while, Jack and Meg try to bring it back, whereas i don't think this album will stick a long time, it is their best work, laden with tributes to Led Zeppelin and the like... classic rock coming back through... if you like that genre... you'll like this
B00009APK1|5.0|The fullscreen version of The Two Towers is poorly edited.  At one point Frodo and Sam look off to Mordor and all your see is half of a cape and empty landscape.  Do yourself a favor and get the Widescreen/Letterbox version.  My TV is only 15&quot; but I won't settle for less than best.
B0000B3FCX|3.0|Whereas it's better than the previous effort, Silver Side Up, it still lacks the ability to keep you hook from start to finish, too long? maybe, not enough really good songs, also maybe, it's ok but not brilliant, but i may be wrong and you can give it a listen because i still think it's good just might take a while to get used to...
B000002VMD|5.0|Exceptional singing but Whitney already has a nice voice to go with it . These songs are very nice and very well picked so I would truly reccommend anyone who likes whitney to buy this album !!!! Whitney really delivers on this album!!!!!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|The genius of Nickelback's latest disc is the skillful way that they have combined hard-hitting riffs with melodic brilliance.<BR>This is the kind of rock the world has been missing.<BR>Strong and thoughtful lyrics, attitude, real musical credibility and a dose of what I call, &quot;YEAH&quot;.<BR>If you liked &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, this one is even more enjoyable.<BR>My favorite tracks are: <BR>LEARN THE HARD WAY (can't get enough of this one.)<BR>BELIEVE IT OR NOT<BR>YANKING OUT MY...<BR>SEE YOU AT THE SHOW<BR>FEELIN' WAY TOO DAMN GOOD<BR>SOMEDAY.<BR>Check this one out.

B0000028VT|5.0|I hadn't been too keen on the &quot;Emotions&quot; single and had prematurely written &quot;sophomore slump&quot; on her forehead.  With Music Box being on power play at the retail store I worked, I was not only quick to erase those words from her forehead but found myself offering to shine her shoes as well.  If her debut was a delicious chocolate truffle, Music Box was a truffle with extra maple syrup and a drop of brandy that brings the heart to a nice and sizzling warmth.<br />The first single and #1 hit &quot;Dreamlover&quot; from opening keyboards, high-pitched note, and dreamy vocals accompanied by drum-machines and synths make this more lush than &quot;Someday&quot; from her debut.  She speaks for millions when she sings &quot;Dreamlover come and rescue me.&quot;/...take me anywhere you want to baby now.&quot;<br />Three Mariah ballads in a row, especially by her and Walter Afanasieff, is like taking a bath in warm latte.  Ooh, that feels soooo good!  I don't know if Mariah read any Joseph Campbell before doing &quot;Hero&quot;, but the opening words &quot;There's a hero/if you look inside your heart&quot; belies that inner journey.  Yet I get so enveloped with this song, I keep thinking she's the one to rescue some poor slob.<br />&quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; has shades of &quot;All Alone In Love&quot; from her debut, but it's enhanced by her usual gospelish backing chorus that includes Kelly Price.  Her voice has very strong R&amp;B stylings here.  After hearing this I thought, Whitney who?<br />The title track begins with keys that sound like an actual music box, and is a more quieter and tender affair.  Key lyrics:  &quot;You take me through the loneliness and the emptiness/And I feel alright 'cause you're by my side.&quot;<br />Clivilles and Cole of the C&amp;C Music Factory get Mariah boogeying down with &quot;Now That I Know&quot; with the skippy percussion.  It's the kind of song Taylor Dayne would've torn her hair to get--but she doesn't have the range.  There's some old disco-style synths here.  The other song they do for her, &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; is the same skippy 80's Paula Abdul-style dance floor pop.<br />Another three ballads in a row?  Stop!  Oh, this is sheer bliss!<br />Mariah and Babyface did the music, lyrics, and backing vocals for &quot;Never Forget You&quot; is one of those &quot;I'll remember you&quot; kind of songs for a departed lover.

While she admirably does this, I find myself siding with Heart's rendition of it on Magazine.  &quot;Just To Hold You Once Again&quot; with its resonant organ synth and gospel choir is another &quot;Whitney who?&quot; song.  &quot;Even though you're not my lover/even though you're not my friend/I would give my all/to have you ehre/just to hold you once again&quot; goes the chorus.  I would give my all?  But that's two albums away.<br />&quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; which follows the second C&amp;C song, is my favourite ballad here, as it's one loving embrace of a song, hair softly brushing against ear, cheek to cheek, slow-dancing,... it's so wonderful I can't listen to it time after time without melting.<br />Music Box, with its seven(!) ballads, is one of the three diamonds in the Mariah tiara (hey, that kinda rhymes).

B0000542D2|2.0|I am glad I kept the original MPI DVD with the Stereo remixed versions of the songs. The music sounds flat and muddy. The only advatage to this version is that is widescreen. The bonus features are not all that great. I figured when this movie got released for a second time on DVD it would be far superior. My mistake! If you are lucky enough to find the original DVD, I recommend that over this. It's a shame seeing how well \\"Yellow Submarine was done and the Anthology DVD set. I wasn't even happy with the packaging. When I saw the DVD I though \\"This is it?\\". Very bland like the audio and the bonus features. Why didn't Apple give this their superior treatment? Boo for Miramax!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This deluxe edition is wonderful. The sound and color of the remastered movie are breathtaking. And the extras on Disc 2 are as good the movie. It was very poignant to listen to the artists and moviemakers reminisce so lovingly - after 14 years, they still get choked up about it! The only curious gap was the lack of interviews with the voice talents. Granted, they are all busy busy busy, but I would have loved to hear Matthew, Moira, Nathan, Ernie, James, Whoopi and Jeremy talk about the experience and what they think about it now.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This is a classic and a must own for any Whitney Houston fan if you only buy one Whitney Houston album in your lifetime buy this one this album delivers so well the singing, the style, and the pitch of her voice so nice and graceful this is a great classic album to own I love this album just about every track on this album is wonderful and is a classic I love this whole album!!!! This is Whitney's first album so therefore it is her debut album and a very nice one!!!!!

B0000AM6K2|5.0|Josh Rouse is a talented artist who has been flying beneath the radar for a few years.  He is an exceptional songwriter and arranger whose past work has been consistanley strong, especially last years UNDER THE COLD BLUE STARS.<br />1972 finds Rouse coming into his own and finding his true voice.  This is an album of contrasts between sunny sounding music, informed by early to mid 70's AM pop, and darker lyrics more worldly lyrics.  For the uninitiated, his work falls between Wilco of Summerteeth and Freedy Johnston's first couple albums.<br />This definatley rates as one of the top releases of the year.  As a bonus, there is a DVD documentary about Rouse, which contains several great live performances.  Though not vital or earthshaking in content, it provides an interesting angle into Rouse's musical journey.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has a long history of being one of the more popular DJ acts on the club scene.  His ability to mix all manner of sounds to create some of the most diverse electronica music earned him an ardent, albeit small, cult following.  The electronica/techno genre doesn't generally lend itself to widespread, mainstream acceptance.  In an attempt to attract a much larger audience, Moby executed a unique strategy for promoting his multi-platinum breakout album &quot;Play&quot;.  As most of the tracks on &quot;Play&quot; aren't necessarily what the typical radio program director would consider to be 'radio-friendly', Moby got a large number of &quot;Play&quot;'s tracks to be attached to television commercials.  TV commercials are a medium that does not need to conform to any specific musical format.  As a result, these songs were made accessible to the general public, which developed a fervent interest in the songs and the artist.  This ingenious marketing campaign led to &quot;Play&quot; selling a ridiculously high number of albums.  One of the most notable commercials was for Tiger Woods and Nike Golf where Tiger is playing golf all across downtown Manhattan to tune &quot;Find My Baby&quot;, track #2 on &quot;Play&quot;.  <BR><BR>Inventive marketing aside, &quot;Play&quot; still would not have found such a mass popularity if it weren't for the fact that is was a fabulous album.  &quot;Find My Baby&quot; is actually one of the lesser tracks on the album, in my estimation.  Moby mixes every kind of beat and mood in his song.  He creates the slow and haunting meditative sounds of &quot;Porcelain&quot; while creating a body-moving, beat-thumping, dance club favorite in &quot;Bodyrock&quot; (I might add that this is a very good tune to listen to when working out).  He mixes a cross of blues and techno with &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot; and plays soaring, heavenly sounds on &quot;Natural Blues&quot;, arguably the two best tracks on &quot;Play&quot;, respectively.Moby even manages to produce a 'radio-friendly' song that achieved mass appeal with &quot;South Side&quot;.  Initially just Moby with a non-descript female backup singer, &quot;South Side&quot; morphed into something much more when he remade it with No Doubt's Gwen Stefani as a powerful, opposing female voice on this song.  The genius of this album cannot be understated.  &quot;Play&quot; provides hours of satisfying repeated listenings.  Moby has definitely 'arrived' with this album.
B00008EY9G|3.0|Most of what can be said (and shouldn't be said because it spoils the movie) has been said in other reviews. Overall, the film is well done in terms of acting and building suspense. But it loses a lot when the mystery is revealed. The revelation I feel really takes away from the movie because it is such a cheap answer to the questions in the viewers mind. In spite of that I would have given it 4 stars if it were not for the very cheesy, cliche last scene.<br />I think the movie is worth seeing even though it is disappointing.

B000002KDZ|5.0|This great album marks a turning point in music history.This recordng goes to show that Latin people, and our music was here to stay.Santana proved that,and Malo did it again.Up until that point there were not a lot of latin sounds in rock,Malo of course changed all that-creating a melodic blend of danceable latin rhythms and rock guitar playing paired with a great latin horn section and piano/organ.The original version of \\"Cafe\\" on this album is not on the best of Malo.\\"Just say goodbye\\" is a great all most instrumental featuring Richard Bean on vocals,who later went on to start his own band \\"Sapo\\".\\"Suavecito\\" has always been a classic out here. \\"Nena\\" is a total latin percussion and rhythm orgy.This is an essential purchase!! ...
6303402348|5.0|About once a year, I watch this unique and heartwarming film to experience the sorrow and joy and beauty of life.  And each year, Forrest Gump proves itself abundantly deserving of both its Academy Award for Best Picture and its status as an amazon.com Essential Video.<br />The film chronicles, from boyhood on, the life and times of a mentally slow but good-hearted and physically gifted Southerner.  In doing so, it recreates vibrantly and poignantly the most turbulent decades of change (the 60s and 70s) in twentieth century America.  It is thus the story of a man who remains innocent in the midst of a nation rapidly losing its innocence and, because of his difference, makes a difference.  Ultimately, it is a love story that, both throughout and in its sublime conclusion, dares to address the issue of free will versus predestination.  (And does so more successfully than any film--and perhaps any popular work of art.)<br />Tom Hanks enters an amazing, tour de force performance, actually becoming the slow-witted but faithful Gump.  The tenderly stunning Robin Wright Penn and the perfectly-cast Gary Sinise shine in memorable supporting roles.  The soundtrack--a remarkable combination of original music, period-evoking songs, and haunting silence--is one of the best in recent memory.  And the screenplay--which goes far above and beyond the earthier, lesser book on which the film is 'based'--is simply inspired, a work of magic.<br />I've seen this film several times now, and each time I can only cry at its evocation of life's essence, even as I smile thereafter.  Highly recommended and very much worth owning and sharing.  Five shining stars.
0131103628|5.0|If you intend to do any real world programming, you will need to know C.  Whether writing in C, or just maintaining someone else's C code. Even if you're doing C++, It's still based on C.  <br />If you want to be able to use C, you should have this book. Contrary to what others have reported, it is possible to learn C from this book.  It just isn't spoonfed to you.  You have to look at things, and apply concepts rather than copy and modify code.<br />I got my first copy of this book about 7 years ago, and I still carry it in my laptop bag, which goes pretty much wherever I do.<br />One thing however. If you're expecting to learn how to program from this book, you WILL be disappointed.  You should already know something of structured programming languages.  For that matter, if you are new to programming, C itself isn't your best choice.  Python seems to be the modern beginner language of choice.  Others choose Visual Basic, however that has it's own problems.<br />Overall however this is the best C programming book out there, if you're willing to make the effort to understand it.
0060977493|1.0|Where to start ... Arundhati Roy's writing style is highly derivative and heavily indebted to magical realism and Isabella Allende in particular. It lacks originality in style and content. It employs the over-used device of a character returning home and engaging in a series of flashbacks that eventually lead to the present ... and worst of all, buys into the falsehood of children being wise beyond their years (gag!). It's hard to feel any sympathy for a book populated with bourgeois characters that are each conveniently equipped with uncanny eccentricities. I fault the editor who seems to have locked her read pen in her desk when she should have been doing her job. This work should be edited down to a nice ten page short story.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|i just got the cd of t.a.t.u in its great there vocies are great the songs in lyrics plus the beats are great this cd is a must get cd its unlike anything out there ( SO WHY YA READING THIS FOR GET YA ASS UP IN GO BUY THE CD NOW ) trust me this cd is a money's worth cd its the best this cd will keep you wanting more so go buy it
B0000507R2|5.0|This album was made for DVD by an artist that not only did the format justice, but wrote some amazing songs.  I had this on CD, but the DVD-A was another experience.  Many of the songs that were not released are enveloping and pull you into the mind of the writer.  Don't pass up the opportunity to enjoy her talent and how this format puts you &quot;into the studio&quot;.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|first of all, i'm an avid neil young fan. and i was listening through the good and the bad. his 70's stuff is unbelievable, his 90's is just as good. his 80's....not so good. and this decade wasn't looking too good either, based on the flop,     are you passionate. but then came greendale.<BR>    the music specs: neil is gaining an old man singing way, but i like it. this album is full of cynicysm and humor, but you have to listen to the rich and deep lyrics. crazy horse is actually in this album for more then one song(goin home was the only one featuring CH on are you passionate), and they are really into it. this album has the spirit of crazy horse that ragged glory did. i feared they had lost it, but it only seems to have gotten stronger. the only dissapointment is the mysterious abscence of frank &quot;poncho&quot; sampedro. oh well.<BR>    this album is a concept album, meaning all the songs are linked by a plot: same chars., same place, same story. this is neil's first time doing this sort of thing, and he did an amazing job despite that. i got really into the characters. i found myself listening to it, not for the music, but for the story. even the sense of the music is apparent, as the music seems darker towards the end.<BR>   Songs: devil's sidewalk is a nice gem. grandpa's interview is probably the best story song. bringing down dinner has an organ in it, a nice touch. then there's be the rain.<BR>   be the rain is one of neil's greatest rocking songs of all time, right next to like a like a hurricane, keep on rocking in the free world, and im the ocean. that song is pure emotion, with music and words on the side.<BR>   add all that together with a dvd of his solo show in dublin, in which he plays acoustic and tells the whole plot of greendale. a great acoustic listen. <BR>  Keep on rocking, neil
B000002H97|2.0|Okay, so many old school Metallica fans probably hate, its natural.  BUt I think none of them got to the seventh track, Through the Never!  That is a great song, sure, nowhere near their best, but its a good song.  This album has 3 good songs.  The majorly overrated Enter Sandman, Holier Than Though (gotta love that riff), and Through the Never (a good metal track).  Wherever I May Roam has one good riff, but thats it.  Kirk has some terrible solos on this one as well.  I'd reccomend passing over this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is what I call a \\"realistic sci-fi\\" about a spaceship crew who make thier living by any means necessary.  These are space mercenaries who travel the galaxy... battling injustice... and committing criminal acts... the finest in Anti-Heroes!!!  The writing was phenomenal, the characters were no where near Mr/Miss Perfect, thier ship was held together with spit and twine... and I loved the \\"Space Cowboy\\" theme that the show portrayed.  I still don't get what everyone is saying when they start talking in Mandarin... but who cares... it gives the show a unique flavor and makes the watcher wonder about the development path of mankind that led to making this part of everyday society.  As I said... it's a GREAT SHOW!!!    When I first saw the previews for this show before it aired, I thought it looked cool.  Well... I was working that Friday evening, so I taped it.  Awesome foresight on my part, because I taped the show from then on!  Since it's cancellation, I have probably re-watched this series about 12 times (plus I lent the tapes out a few times)... but the tapes are starting to degrade a little.  So...    THANK YOU for releasing this series to DVD so quickly!!!  (This Brown Coat is doing his happy Snoopy dance!)
B000089RVX|1.0|Well, if it isn't &quot;Without Temptation&quot;.  These guys are a rip-off of the great stuff that has been perfected in Europe for the past 7 years at least.  I think I've heard of this style before, who do they &quot;sort-of-but-not-exactly&quot; sound like, oh yeah, The Gathering.  Say, Anneke called and said &quot;Quit biting off of us!!!&quot;  I do NOT like this album.  I don't mind music with Christian undertones (I listen to blatantly Christian bands like Living Sacrifice and Mortification), but this truly is an insult.  To call this metal, or even goth, is an insult to the ones that listen to metal and/or goth.  This makes King Diamond a &quot;must-listen&quot;, and I HATE KING DIAMOND!!!<br />Try some Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, Tristania, The Sins Of Thy Beloved, Nine Inch Nails, Amorphis, Lake Of Tears, Moonspell, Paradise Lost (the &quot;pop song&quot; One Second), Flowing Tears (even though their English sucks), Dark Tranquility, In Flames (okay, not the same style, but I had to plug them in), Drain STH (STH meaning Stockholm, as in Sweden, the airport), again, The Gathering, Theatre Of Tragedy (the Aegis album and back), and Philadelphia's own Tapping The Vein (&quot;The Damage&quot;, quite possibly the most depressing album I owned, so depressing I had to give it away, NO JOKE).  I don't care if the bands I mentioned also took a bite off of King Diamond and I DON'T CARE!!!  And to hell with Abigail (don't laugh, I'm serious).<br />Avoid Evanessence and try the above listing.  If you want a tougher selection of agressive metal (borderline Death Metal in a Slayer kind of way), then write me, and I'll let you have a list.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I actually seen Gaven Degraw at House of Blues open for SIster Hazel and it was by far the best show i have ever been to. He is definitley a rising star as we speak. If you watch &amp;quot;WB&amp;quot; at all his song opens the new hit show &amp;quot;one tree hill&amp;quot;. Definitely a great great group and fun to go and see.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Okay, as said, this is a two disk album.  The first disk is 5 songs, averaging about 10 minutes a piece, and the 2nd disk is a &quot;mini-concept&quot; album, lasting 42 minutes.  The music on the 2nd disk is fantastic, as it always is.  But the concept is extremely weak for DT standards, and I find the 2nd disk a little pointless.<BR>Disk 1, in my opinion, is probably DT's best work to date, and I like all the other CD's.  But this disk, these five songs, seem to be their most concentrated writing ever.   &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; is not for the nu-metal or Celine Dion fans.  It is complex, progressive metal, in the vein of Pantera or Metallica.  Great music, but mediocre lyrics.  The drummer, Mike Portnoy, really needs to leave the lyrics to the rest of the band.  <BR>Blind Faith, the 2nd song, is amazing.  Not nearly as heavy as alot of their stuff, but it rocks really hard and the lyrics are some of DT's best.<BR>3rd Misunderstood, this song could've been huge for radio, if edited down that is.  How many times can you listen to Stained, sitting around, spewing the same old lines of depression over and over?  This song takes the isolation and loneliness thing to a new level.  Great words and brooding music.<BR>4th  The Great Debate, possibly, one of their best songs ever.  It's all about Stem Cell research and whether or not it should be legal.  It doesn't take either side through all 13 minutes, but instead shows both points of view so you get a full description of the publics deillema.  Great words, great music in the vein of Rush and Tool.<BR>5th  Disappear, one of their shorter songs, 6mins, and probably the most touching part of the album.  James Labries vocals float over the dank, dark, music.  It's all about loss, and having to move on.  Breathtaking.<BR>I'd call this DT's best work, closely followed by Scenes, Images and Words, Awake, Falling Into Infinity, and When Day &amp; Dream Unite.  If you like amazing, complex music with heart and soul, DT is for you.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|If you like honest and authentic rock, buy this, i was there and the last hour was the better i've ever seen. Springsteen is the best live performer in the world. i've been watching U2 and The Rolling and they can not compete with Springsteen anyway. If this DVD contains the same strength that this concert got,then you will be watching god singing, (that was what people was screaming when the last song ended). Don't miss \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Ramrod\\", and look at the audience, it was incredible.In the States, you like Eminen and all those pathetic rappers, but in Europe we laught at them, we prefer good and intelligent music.
0140177396|5.0|A classic, terrific story, I would recommend it to anyone!
B000001F5F|5.0|This album marks the end of that era, a time when U2 were still hungry, awe-inspiring little punks. Yeah, for the first time since about 1969, a little band named from Ireland made it possible to be cool and political at the same time.  After &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky,&quot; people realized that it was getting pretty late into the '80's, and it was about darn time to stop caring about much of anything.  <BR>But there's still hope left in this album, and U2 don't let that hope and their cool little epoch go down without a fight.  If you've ever seen the video, you can my point in about a thousand sweaty kids thinking in unison, &quot;This is the best night of my life.&quot;  If you haven't, then the music should prove it just the same: side 1 songs like &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;I Will Follow&quot; set you free, running wild, dancing as much like Molly Ringwald as you can manage; side 2 songs like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;40&quot; grip you at the smallest, most tender places of your heart.  Bono is just earnest, the Edge just rocks, and the sound just soars.  It's as desperate and sweet as teenage love, so don't let U2 today fool you; once upon time they were as this albums sounds.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show has excellent stories, great characters, and a great cast of actors portraying them. I'm really not that big a fan of Joss Wheadon's other shows, but this one was something special. I would be very surprised if someone bought this series and did not enjoy it.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah's evolution, this became the first album of Mariah to be purely R&amp;B and Pop, with great results!, sadly it was lost by the time &quot;Rainbow&quot; came, all the tracks are nicely produced, &quot;Honey&quot; produced by Puff Daddy and many others, this has great lyrics and music!, &quot;Butterfly&quot; amazing ballad, great message, awful video, &quot;My All&quot; great guitars!, great message, and lyrics, &quot;The Roof&quot; nicely sweetly voice, &quot;Fourth Of July&quot; little bit anoying!, &quot;Breakdown&quot; favorite!, great lyrics!, great joint!, &quot;Babydoll&quot; wow, sadly this is not as good as I thought, because if Missy produced it, it was good, but NOT, this is boring and a big big filler!, &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; should have been a single, great song, what about the voice, is sounds like angels!, &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; classic Mariah sound, &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; written by Prince, slow sexy joint. &quot;Outside&quot; great closer! amazing song.  This album is a great mixture of ballad and R&amp;B, Butterfly guided fans to a new Mariah that could direct her career in a more fun way, far away from the Whitney esque. Will be a great addition to your collection.
B000000WZ4|4.0|While this CD doesn't quite live up to its hype-ish name, &quot;Ultra&quot; does have its highlights, like the opening single, &quot;Barrel of a Gun,&quot; as well as &quot;It's No Good&quot; (#4) and &quot;Useless&quot; (#6)--just three that I like, off the top of my head. It's the slower songs that didn't quite do it for me (which is saying a lot since the majority of songs on here are pretty slow), e.g., &quot;The Love Thieves&quot; (#2), with its James Bond-ish guitar solo near the end (though it does have a great beginning--same goes for &quot;Sister of Night&quot; (#7). A lot of the tracks on &quot;Ultra&quot; feel more like ambient lounge fillers than songs, namely &quot;Uselink&quot; (#5), &quot;Jazz Thieves&quot; (#8), and &quot;Junior Painkiller&quot; (#12)--though, I have to say, I enjoyed some of them more than a few of the vocal tunes.<br />It's taken awhile for this CD to grow on me--and I'm still trying to break it in, even though it's been years since I bought it. It's not as dance/pop-ish as some of Depeche Mode's older stuff; in fact, it's more &quot;mature,&quot; as some reviewers have put it, though I think that's just code for mellow and boring--which this CD does suffer from in spots. I wouldn't consider &quot;Ultra&quot; essential listening, but loyal DM fans should like it fairly well.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage against the machine is one of the most amazing bands ever. Not just ever, but forever. Evidence of this is shown on this cd with songs like &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Mic Check&quot;, and &quot;Ashes in the fall&quot;. I find it quite amazing that every sound on this cd is made by guitar, drums, bass, or vocals. Everyone in this band is very talented, Zack rapping/singing clever anti-society statements, Tom going nuts on the guitar, Tim playing great bass, and Brad pounding on the drums, like in the chorus of Ashes in the Fall. Overall this is a great cd if you like rocking hard and hip-hop (kind of Red Hot Chili Peppers with harder vocals). I strongly suggest this cd to anyon
0385509456|2.0|..but I didn't like it at all.  I only finished this book because it was so short.  The robot-like personalities of autistic people translate well on screen, but not in print.  The story was boring and wooden and I felt no attachment at all to any of the characters.  So many times I read a book, love it, and then see that someone gave it a terrible review.  &quot;How could they?&quot;, I think to myself.  Now I know.
0140277447|5.0|Taking a quick look at previous reviews pertaining to this book, Rape of Nanking, it became all too evident at how Japanese are still so reluctant to admitting their horrendous action.  The purpose of the book was far from finger pointing or an attempt to induce guilt into the modern Japanese' collective conscious.  It was an analytical book of the psychological state of man that has enabled such an act to surface, especially from a \\"Japanese\\" society where honour codes are deeply rooted at the core of its structure.  Step out of your personal wheltannschauung and take a look at it from an outsider's viewpoint.  If the Japanese desire compensation from the atrocities that they themselves had to encounter in North America due to WW2, what makes them think that others will not desire the same?  Chances are, if you like or dislike certain behaviours directed against you, others would feel the same.
1577312082|5.0|I listened to the audio CDs of this book and it has changed my &quot;life.&quot;  Tolle's message is incredible, revolutionary, yet seemingly something I already knew (but just didn't realize it).  His words are the truest I have ever heard and the book has completely given me new perspective and brought me in touch with who I am really.  It has also helped me to make sense of a multitude of spiritual encounters and life experiences that I could never before understand, ones that certainly no conventional religious organization or church congregation ever spoke to.  I am humbly practicing living in the power of the now and am amazed at the peace and serenity - and joy of living - that I feel when I remain present.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for an end to suffering, and end to pain (i.e. - everyone).

0140277447|4.0|Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang is a brave attempt at exposing the Holocaust of Asia. It is indeed a very provocative book and no doubt,would enrage Japanese. Although some of her sources are far from perfect, it tugs at the core of humanity. Furthermore, it provides the readers with the information that had been hidden for too long. The purpose of the book was far from finger pointing or an attempt to induce guilt into the modern Japanese' collective conscious.  It was an analytical book of the psychological state of man that has enabled such an act to surface, especially from a \\"Japanese\\" society where honour codes are deeply rooted at the core of its structure.  Stepping out of one's personal wheltannschauung and taking a good look at it from an outsider's viewpoint may serve to be quite useful.  If the Japanese desire compensation from the atrocities that they themselves had to encounter in North America due to WW2, what makes them think that others will not desire the same?  Chances are, if you like or dislike certain behaviours directed against you, others would feel the same. Taking a quick look at previous reviews pertaining to this book, Rape of Nanking, it became all too evident at how Japanese are still so reluctant to admitting their horrendous action. The white-washing of historical text books by the Japanese Educational Ministry is all but too true. Their on going attempts to remove such material is indeed causing more friction, frustration, and anger for those who have survived the ordeal.
B000003S2O|5.0|One of my favorite recordings of all time, and one that holds so many special memories. It's amazing the way a recording can change your mood and help you to think clearly, and with a different perspective. This album literally alters your mood. If you've ever played this album at low-ish volume on a lazy, cloudy day and taken a nap with it on - talk about Freudian dreams! This recording is a total masterpiece.<br />I had a friend that I bought this for years ago... telling him that it was one of my favorite recordings and it was genius and that I hoped he got as much out of it as I had. He called me back the next day after playing it at home and told me he thought it was really &quot;scary&quot; sounding... and it freaked him out and he didn't like it at all. Years pass... one day in conversation he unexpectedly tells me that &quot;...that weird Brian Eno CD I got him... the one with all the grumbles and hums and distant  animal sounds...&quot; has ever so slowly been pulled out of hiding and has now turned into one of his favorite CDs. He says it initially scared him... but there was something about it that made him keep thinking of it and going back to it again and again. He now listens to it almost every day while working because it clears his mind and inspires him. He says &quot;...it sounds like something God would record.&quot;<br />I would love to see this CD re-released by Eno one day, perhaps with extra recordings that never made it onto the final album... or longer versions of each track (they all fade out at the end). THAT would be a revelation!!!

I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" Alice Sebold draws the reader into the book right in the first sentence. Action packed, The Lovely Bones will bring tear and laughter upon each new page from the beginning to end. This book to all ages should come as a reality check in teaching that not everyone can be trusted. The language in this book is very easy to read and good for younger teens while at the same time not too easy for more mature readers. The book involves so many different settings with a lot of imagery to attract and fulfill any one. The characters are all completely different and exciting. The characters age differs from Buckley at five to Grandma Lynn in her nineties which brings wonderful diversity to the book. The suspenseful plot throughout the whole book makes the story terrific. One the first sentence has been read, eyes seem to stayed glued to Susie's adventure. Alice Sebold starts off The Lovely Bones with the murder of the protagonist Susie Salmon. George Harvey, the man next door, is Susie's killer. George Harvey is able to keep his serial killer instinct hidden throughout the story. From the time she's killed to the end we learn more about the fourteen-year-old and sit with her in heaven as she watches her loved one's tribulation's on earth. For the most part the reader becomes Susie and shares her hopes and fears. Her father, mother, sister and closest friends each cope with her death differently. George Harvey, the antagonist also watches the family also with no guilt at all. The suspense never goes down a level and by the end of the book strong emotions are created toward each character. The most important part of the story to make it so effective would be the imagery. The amazing details make the book feel more like a movie. Since it's talking about a young girl, it's easy to bring back very fond childhood memories. \\"But on December 6, 1973, it was snowing, and I took a shortcut through the cornfield back from the junior high. It was dark out because the days were shorter in the winter, and I remember now the broken cornstalks made my walk more difficult.\\" This is something everyone can so easily imagine. Coming down off the climax, the book started to drag out and gain too much wordiness. A non-perfect rating was given to the book for this reason. The paragraphs begin to get incredibly long. This section doesn't involve a real setting; it's really Susie talking and brings all the irony and events into place. Although some of the information given in this section is important, it could have been done without and could have been shortened. The plot in The Lovely Bones is very well thought out. After the first sentence what the story is about is revealed. Alice Sebold enters with a fascinating beginning and tells so much in such little pages. Tears are able to form in such little time and from then on out the book stays on your mind. The pace is a very good speed in the beginning.  It contains a lot of flashback in the whole story. There is a complete chapter called snapshots dedicated to flashbacks. There is also some great foreshadowing in which ends the story. The characterization is wonderful, and makes for either total love or hate toward each person in the book. The protagonist, Susie Salmon and the antagonist, George Harvey have many internal conflicts throughout the book. Susie watches her father, mother, sister, sisters boyfriend, brother, grandmother, friend, and boyfriend from heaven along with many others. Each character is different and very independent. At the beginning Buckley is at the age of five and by the end he's a mature teenager and not to mention an uncle. Seeing how each character deals with the death in different ways, so there is always someone in the story for comparison. Most characters are completely round and this shows how much of her heart and time Alice Sebold put into this story. The book is sucha nail biting thriller. The astounding people and heartfelt story make for an unforgettable past time. Falling in love with this book is not hard to do. Comparing real life to The Lovely Bones is so easy and makes for an understanding on what is real and what people want out of life. Hopes, dreams, and fears lie within everyone and in this little girl so many of those are created and wished for. Like Mrs. Fason said, \\"I won't be happy till every girl has read this book.\\" Now, more than ever, I agree wholeheartedly.
0767903862|2.0|Billy Bryson is a talented writer. He just needs to get out of his car more.<br />I just finished this book, and although the writer's patter could make acupuncture interesting, the lack of effort in this one is staggering.<br />Billy prefers to write about huge walks in safe city suburbs, visiting bookshops and coffee shops, oh and museums.<br />Maybe all those things are impossible in the US..<br />Maybe it is all those dangerous critters that kept him on the narrow path..<br />I really don't think he needs to travel to write at this level. It seems he could do this without treading outside of his study.<br />Most of this book is paraphrased from other books ( a large bibliography is tell tale), and the personal content is stuff not worthy of print.<br />In A Sunburnt Country he barely steps out of his car, except for when he doesn't have a car and is walking the streets. <br />I do not recommend this to anyone. It is a lazy effort.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|JET is the band I've been searching for...they rock.  Not only do they play great music, but they seem to really mean it.  I caught them live a couple months ago and that's what turned me on.  The only flaw with this album is that I think some of the new mixes of songs arent as good as the older versions.  I personally like the mixes of &quot;Cold Hard B**ch&quot; and &quot;Move On&quot; much better on their old EP, &quot;Dirty Sweet&quot;.  No matter what, this CD is worth your ten bucks.  JET is hyped for a reason...THEYLL ROCK YOUR PANTS OFF!!!
038572179X|5.0|Unforgiven Atonement<br /> Atonement \e-ton-ment\: To do something to make up for a wrong done. Ian McEwan's Atonement is a wonderful novel of childhood and adulthood, guilt and forgiveness, love and war.  He ties all of this together in an extraordinarily ambitious way. He grabs the reader's attention and keeps it throughout the novel with imagery that is luminously real. With brilliant imagery, McEwan depicts life during WW11 to the closing of the twentieth century.<br />          This novel is true to its title. It's about actual Atonement.  The main character, Briony Tallis, sees a crime as a youthful girl.  Her overactive imagination and longing to mature leads her to make up a story, instead of telling what she really saw.  This crime brings about chaos in her life, as well as the lives of the family and friends surrounding her.  This crime lives on in the hearts and minds of everyone.  This one incident splits the family down the middle. As Briony ages, she spends the rest of her life trying to atone her crime.<br />          The novel opens up in \\"another beautiful day in London\\" of 1935. McEwan starts out describing the mansion where the Tallis family lives. Briony's thoughts on the house are very detailed. \\"Their room was a pitiful mess of clothes, wet towels, orange peel, torn-up pieces of a comic arranged around a sheet of paper, upended chairs partly covered by blankets and the mattress at a slew.\\"  With this gratifying depiction McEwan leads the reader to believe they are in the very room.  In the second part of the novel, the setting changes to the heat of WW11.  Here, the author depicts the horror of war.  \\"When they reached the level crossing, after a 3-mile walk, along a narrow road, he saw the path he was looking for meandering off to the right, then dipping and rising toward a copse that covered a low hill to the northwest.\\"  Vigorous detail like this makes the novel interesting, and somewhat moving.  At the closing of the tale, the story jumps forward into the end of the twentieth century, where the story comes to a close.<br />          The characters in the story are unbelievably life like.  The reader gets insight on each of the characters inner thoughts and struggles.  All of the characters have flaws, some more obvious than others, yet they're all still present.  Briony wants passionately to grow up, and be considered an adult long before she is actually ready for the responsibility, making her very confident.  \\"She had no doubt.  She could describe him.  There was nothing she could not describe.\\"  Lola, Briony's cousin was the one whom the crime was committed against.  Lola is a strangely interesting character.  \\"Nothing much was ever required of Lola after that, for she was able to retreat behind an air of wounded confusion, and as a treasured patient, recovering victim, lost chilled, let herself be bathed in the concern and guilt of the adults in her life.\\"  She hid behind a wall, not wanting to express herself, not letting anything out, just bottling it all up inside of her.  Yet, she does not stay this way, nor does Briony.  In the second part of the novel, during WW11, Briony is a young nurse.  She has matured greatly, and she's ready to atone her crime.  \\"Did she really think she could hide behind some borrowed notions of modern writing, and drown her guilt in a stream of consciousness?\\"  As the novel progresses, Briony's maturity and longing to be free from this lifetime of guilt also progresses.  \\"How could that constitute an ending?  I'm too old, too frightened, too much in love with the shred of life I have remaining.  I face an incoming tide of forgetting, and then oblivion.\\"  Briony is a very dynamic character. She has so many different moods and thoughts, all complicated and each intricate making the story believable.<br />          The diction used throughout the novel is extraordinary. The use of extensive vocabulary makes this book an adventure.  His use of metaphors and similes makesthe book peculiar and textured.  \\"The agreeable nullity of Leon's life was a polished artifact, its ease deceptive, its limitations achieved by invisible hard work and the accidents of character, none of which she could hope to rival.\\"  The imagery in this book paints a perfectly detailed word picture in the readers mind.  \\"The island temple, built in the style of Nicholas Revett in the late 1780s, was intended as a point of interest, and eye-catching feature to enhance the pastoral ideal, and had of course no religious purpose at all.  It was near enough to the water's edge, raised upon a projecting bank, to cast an interesting reflection in the lake, and from most perspective the row of pillars and the pediment above them were charmingly half obscured bye the elms and oaks that had grown up around.  Closer to, the temple had a sorrier look: moisture rising through a damaged damp course had caused chunks of stucco to fall away. Sometime in the late nineteenth century clumsy repairs were made with unpainted cement which had turned brown and gave the building a mottled, diseased appearance.\\"  With only words, McEwan has the ability to strongly persuade opinion. <br />          Ian McEwan's style is precarious.  He manages to take a story without much plot and make it riveting.  The movement of the story is not in the plot; it's in the characters and the way McEwan jumps between the characters and their inner thoughts. The characters themselves reflect his style. Briony changes many times throughout the novel. At one point she works as a nurse, taking long shifts, making her delusional.  This makes her narrative unreliable. Most of the characters have an inner conflict, external conflict, or both, making their narrative partial.  The book consists of much imagery, with a very subtle, devious plot.  The imagery foreshadows the plot, but not the first time the book is read.  <br />          The book is very interesting, but definitely not for everyone.  The author's extensive knowledge of vocabulary makes the novel difficult to read.  The story takes surprising twists and turns, keeping the reader attached, and on edge.  The book is hard to follow, but when everything comes together, the story becomes intense.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|this is a wonderful movie,in these days of worthless junk siberling and spielberg have created a classic for our times,this is not supposed to be shakespeare or a literary high drama.. its a movie about a gentle and caring soul and very well done. they managed to capture casper as i rememmber from the sixtes, like how they got \\"superman the movie\\" and the recent \\"spider man\\" they caught on film what i rememmber perfectly from the comic books from so long ago. casper is beautifully done movie with great visuals ( i thought the sequence where casper says to  kat \\" can i keep you \\" was remarkable with absolutly beautifull music by james horner to perfectly augment the scene, and the scene with bill pullman saying goobye to his long lost wife could not have been done better if more movies were made like this our world be all the better for it , again an absolutly beautifully done wonderous movie for our time and we all should be gratefull for it
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Here come the flamers. The people who proclaim any new cd by any band that they hate sucks and is their worst release ever!  It must be nice to have the money to buy tons of cd's that you know you'll despise, just to write hate reviews.  Truth is, they never buy the cd, never listen to it, just hop online and criticize away.  <BR>This cd rocks.  Trust me. Trust Maiden.  Spend the money, you will not regret it.  <BR>To hell with the flamers who have probably moved on to flame the new Metallica or Rush cd that they've just downloaded for free.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is often toted as the best rock album ever. Although no albumdeserves that title in my opinion, this is still one of the best album ever. ALmost all the tracks are memmorable and the diversity of the music makes it a continually entertaining album. I'm going to do a track by track review but since there's 30 tracks my revies will be short.<br />Disc 1<BR>Back In The U.S.S.R. - Great start for a c.d. One of the most widely known songs from this album. Great Beach Boys feeling,great vocals,Great Guitar Solo. An excellent song 11/10<br />Dear Prudence - A slower song,with nice piano and nicely sung. Another loved classicalthough I feel it's a bit too long. 8/10<br />Glass Onion - A great rock song with great sarcasm in the lyrics and a lot of references to other Beatles' song. One of my favorites 10/10<br />Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da. - Everyone knows this song. The song is great but the lyrics are silly 8/10<br />Wild Honey Pie - 50 secs of nonsense, skip this one 0/10<br />The continuing story of Bungalow Bill - A song that sticks in your head. Great chorus and a nice critic of subarban hunters. 10/10<br />While my guitar gently weeps - My favorite George Harrison song. Everything in this song is great.Especially the lyrics and the guitar solo by Eric Clapton. You just want to hear this one over and over 11/10<br />Happiness is a warm gun - One of my favorite Beatles song.John really puts his heart in singing this one. It has a lot of changes in its melody but it somehow all fits together. Excellent lyrics. 11/10<br />Martha my dear - Another good ballad. Nice piano melody and horn section. 8/10<br />I'm so tired - The best ballad on the first disc after while my guitar gently weeps, although this one eventually rocks more. 9/10<br />Blackbird - Nice folk song with a nice chorus but nothing special about it. 7/10<br />Piggies - Weird song by Harrison. Great social critique and keyboard melody. This song is defenitely great although everyone might not like it. 10/10<br />Rocky Racoon - An excellent story-song. Great irony and good harmonica. Great piano bridge. 10/10<br />Don't pass me by - O.k. song. It has a country feel to it. One of the lesser songs on this album. 5/10<br />Why don't we do it in the road - This is a silly song but it has a great beat and is sung with verve. 7/10<br />I Will - Yet another ballad, nothing bad, nothing amazing 6/10<br />Julia - Another ballad, again quite plain. 6/10<br />Disc2<BR>Birthday - Another rocking song. Sung with passion. A really cool birthday song. 10/10<br />Yer Blues - I never thought the Beatles could write such a great blues song. Very depressing song (yes I'm lonely, wanna die)Greatly sung by John. One of my favorites. 11/10<br />Mother Nature's Son - Another soft song, i like this one due to its music and pastoral feel. 8/10<br />Everybody's got something to hide... - Another silly track, although I prefer this one. Very rocking and fun song. 8/10<br />Sexy Sadie - A great ballad. Everything is good in this one, I love the harmonies. 9/10<br />Helter Skelter - his is the heaviest Bertles song ever. Amazing in its ferocity, sounds almost metal. Greatly sung. A favorite 11/10<br />Long Long Long - Another soft song, it has a nice feel to it. 8/10<br />Revolution 1 - One of the greatest political songs ever.Love the choo-be-doo part. Another Favorite 10/10<br />Honey Pie - Great song, it has a nice oldies feel to it. 8/10<br />Savoy Truffle - Another good song by Harrison. Can't really define the style of this one. Love the horns and guitar solo. 8/10<br />Cry Baby - Good song with great piano and chorus. 7/10<br />Revolution 9 - 8:13 of musique concrèete. Frank Zappa did this kind of thing infinitely better. 1 point for sheer guts. 1/10<br />Good Night - An o.k. song, the chords make it sound like a Disney song. Good choice for an album closer. 6/10<br />As you can see it has a lot of amazing songs anfd a few o.k. ones. But the good ones are so good, the o.k. stuff can be forgiven.If you're a fan of rock you need this album.
0385512104|5.0|I found this book the best insight into how my son thinks.  Parents - particularly fathers - may also find helpful Daniel Mont's book, &quot;A Different Kind of Boy: A Father's Memoir About Raising a Gifted Child with Autism.&quot;
B000089RVR|4.0|I want to rate &quot;Life for Rent&quot; for 5 stars, but some songs don't really worth it. <BR>When I listened to her song: &quot;Stoned&quot; and &quot;White Flag&quot;, I knew this album would be great, so I just brought it. So, If this is the first time to listen to Dido's song, try to get this one and You'll think Dido is so good at singing slow songs!<br />Good, More than good, but not great..
B00003CXB4|5.0|I know many people have seen this so I will not write a movie review for it.<br />I will like to state that in the DVD, there are two versions of the movie, the Special Edition and the Theaterical edition.  Personally the only difference between the two is that there is an extra song in the special edition, that's it!<br />As for the way the movie looks, it is clear and colorful.  This edition fully utilizes the DVD experiences.  The music and songs are heard in full force if you have surround sound.  This DVD should be added to your disney platinum collection.<br />The next platinum edition Disney DVD is Aladdin in OCT 2004.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido has always been a magnificent artist.  With this album, she proves she's got staying power.  Her debut had so much intensity and passion, many thought it couldn't be beat.  But Dido has managed to surpass all expectations and give us an album that's not only as deep and intense as &quot;No Angel&quot;, but perhaps a little more emotional.  Staying away from harsher styles and lyrics (i.e. &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; and &quot;Slide&quot;), Dido has taken the subdued route this time.  With mellow tunes and a more optimistic attitude, she refrains from desperation (i.e. &quot;Here With Me&quot; and &quot;Honestly OK&quot;) and seems more content in her songs.  <br />&quot;White Flag&quot; which is the first single, is warm and inviting, growing slowly from sweet to strong.  While not as loud as &quot;Here With Me&quot;, this song has it's own charm.  She longs for love but she's content with it.  That's a rare quality to find in a song, and something only Dido could pull off.  The flowing strings give it the final touch. (10/10)  <br />&quot;Stoned&quot;, the second track and one of my personal favorites, is a bit more contemporary but just as beautiful as you'd expect anything from Dido to be.  With a long drum and bass introduction, it takes you into the mood for the whole song.  The highlight of this piece is the chorus, which has some of the most wonderful chord arrangements ever.  Also the bridge has some fun synth sounds. (10/10)  <br />The title track, &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, is the third song on the album, and extremely mellow.  Again, Dido mixes lots of live instruments with synthesizers; something she is very talented at doing.  This song is thick with music and includes a catchy drum loop which starts in the second chorus. (9/10)  <br />&quot;Mary's In India&quot; is the fourth track, and for this song Dido uses the bare minimum: a guitar, a very soft drum kit and not much else.  There's a few whispy synth effects throughout, which give this songa fantasy feel.  A very cute song. (8/10)  <br />&quot;See You When You're 40&quot; is an elegant piece.  It fades in from nothing, sounding like wind in the forest at night.  A simple drum loop joins, but somehow this song maintains it's spooky feeling.  A very captivating song, it's got some romantic guitar and moody synthesizer effects.  At one point, Dido sings a cappella for a few seconds, sounding haunted but content. (10/10)  <br />The sixth song is arguably one of the best on this album, and is called &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;.  It opens simply, with acoustic guitar and a simple echo.  But once the chorus begins, the strings join and the bass is kicked up a notch.  This is another song where Dido has successfully mixed many contrasting sounds together to make a piece that pops.  It includes some very moving chord progressions, and it's also one of the few songs where Dido sings with a stronger voice. (10/10)  <br />&quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; - when this song begins, you immediately know it's going to be a mysterious one.  It takes a while to build to it's full potential, but the suspense is chilling.  It's got a wonderful bassline that sets the tone and as Dido sings the first chorus with a whispy voice, you get the feeling she's sad.  But by the end of the song, she's strong and commanding.  Creeping strings join her jazzy vocals halfway through, and when the song ends abrubtly, it leaves you wanting more. (10/10)  <br />The next song is the most upbeat, with quicker vocal arrangements and a perfect relationship between the music and lyrics.  It's called &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;.  There's sounds of the blowing breeze on a beach in the first verse, and right away you want to join Dido in her dream.  This song has a wonderful mix of many different sounds, including a 'sparkling' electric piano in the chorus.  You could easily drive on the coast listening to this song.  It's peppy but sweet and laid back at the same time. (10/10)  <br />The ninth track, &quot;Do You Have A Little Time&quot; makes a huge impression.  At first listen, it's not much more than the same chord arrangement over and over again.  But the more you listen to it, the better it gets.  The title is perfect, considering it takes a little time to love this song.  It's got haunting strings and a xylophone-sounding arpeggio in the second verse.  Repetitive, but gorgeous. (10/10)  <br />&quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; has a wonderful message, and despite the fact that is has more instruments than &quot;Mary's In India&quot;, it's probably the simplest song on the album.  With acoustic guitar and piano, it's got almost no synthesizer instruments, except for the bass rhythm in the bridge section.  However, this seems the be the most enchanting piece in all it's simplistic glory. (9/10)  <br />The 'last' track, &quot;See The Sun&quot;, even sounds sunny.  And with lush chords in the chorus, it sounds like the clouds lifting to reveal a brighter day.  This song is perfect for getting over someone, or anything for that matter. (10/10)  <br />The true last song on the album is &quot;Closer&quot;, and it's a hidden track.  It's another song stripped bare of most everything except a guitar and light piano.  But Dido proves to be an excellent artist when it comes to simple tunes.  She really shows her passion through her lyrics when she sings this song.  But then, she does that in every song anyway. (9/10) <br />When an artist can paint a picture and take you there, you know they're truly a musician.  And with Dido, she sometimes leaves the conclusion of a song to our imagination by suddenly ending it; but somehow with her that's okay.  She sings softly but with as much emotion as Celine Dion or Whitney Houston.  This album is a gem, and a wonderful album to relax to.  And even if you like more intense music, I promise you won't be disappointed.  I truly believe this collection of songs is Grammy worthy, and it will be a collection you listen to for years.Don't rob your ears of a beautiful sound any longer - buy &quot;Life For Rent&quot;.
B00005A1PR|3.0|Video is the onyl good song on this album,and then it all goes downhill from there,which is not too good since Video is song #2. Not very catchy melodies,not too good lyrics,overall good effort but still. Out of 15 songs,only one was &quot;repeatable&quot; and that was &quot;Video&quot;. All the other ones were of the same subject matter and got a little boring after a while. So get this if you want,i guess, but if you have a choice between this and another cd,get the other one. I can almost assure you itll be better.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|First of all, don't even try to compare THIRTEENTH STEP to MER DE NOMS. They are two completely different pieces. I've listened to TS almost 30 times now, and I can't find one song that I can compare to the sound of MDN. I love MDN... but that doesn't mean I was expecting A Perfect Circle to release MDN 2 with their new album, and surely enough they've gone and done something completely amazing. For some listeners this album may need several listens to grow on you, and to take it all in. But once it does, you will be glad you bought this cd. I honestly have to say this is one of my all time favourites up there with NIN's The Downward Spiral, Radiohead's Kid A, and Pink Floyd's The Wall. Thirteenth Step, like the aforementioned, may be considered a concept album by some. I personally consider it a journey about discovering the darker side of the human psyche. Themes are touched upon time and time again during the course of the 50 minutes of TS; those of greed, fear, regret, denial, despair, lonliness, loathing, addiction, delusion, love, security, insanity, and a glimpse of hope with the record's closing lines &quot;I choose to live&quot;.<br />Whether you liked MDN or not, if you're an APC or not, Thirteenth Step is a MUST HAVE for anyone who appreciates and loves music. From the angst driven lyrics of &quot;The Package&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot;, to the soft melodic chords of &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;A Stranger&quot;, the catchy rythems of &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, the hysterical yet beautiful &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;, the rocking rythems of &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;, and the eerieness of &quot;Vanishing&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot;.... TS is sure to take you through a roller-coaster of emotions.<br />A MUST HAVE. If I could give it a billion stars I would.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I rank this right behind \\"Chicago\\" for movies of 2003. I loved it. I went back for a second viewing and it was sold out!! Great music. Great performances. Paul doing \\"All Things Must Pass\\". Preston adding his soulful voice to \\"My Sweet Lord\\". Lynne doing \\"The Inner Light\\" with Shankar's daughter on sitar. I took a bathroom break when the Indian musicians came on and almost missed  a great accoustic performance by Clapton. The last song is fabulous. This movie outranks all the Hollywood blockbusters by miles in entertainment value. I wanted my money BACK after Matrix and the Hulk. I'd pay to see this again and again. A shame it didn't get a wider release.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I went to see it twice in the movies, it was great and very true to the early comics of the Hulk, I liked it so much that I hope they make it a trilogy.
006097625X|5.0|Understanding Comics is about so much more than just understanding comics. It is an excellent work on Symbolism in many forms. I have been a fan of comics for years and I think this made me even more so. However, I wanted to know if a non-comic reader would get as much enjoyment out of this as I did. I got my father to read it by telling him about some of the fantastic things inside and left it lying on the table. The next day I found him reading it and he loved it too. We discussed it at great length and I think it left him with a lot more respect for Comics as Art. Everyone should read this book.
0316666343|4.0|I work at a library and was constantly seeing this checked out. I then saw that it made the New York Times best sellers list, now I don't put much stock into this since my tastes differ greatly from what they say is &quot;good&quot;. But I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. It was a captivating story of girl who was rapped and murdered. The beginning was wonderful and kept me turning the pages. The only flaw was that in my opinion there was not a lot of heart wrenching that goes along with such circumstances. Also I found things happened way too smoothly. Still it held my attention and I have to give it that, and it would have still gotten 5 stars from me if it hadn't been for the ending. The ending is what knocked it down; I just ended up scanning over the last few pages for the most part. It seems that it got a little far fetched. Though I do recommend it I would not go so far as to guarantee satisfaction in this read.
0060545658|3.0|Todo lo que escribe me gusta pero aunque es buena no es una de sus mejores novelas. En algunos capitulos me aburri, al principio la encontre un poco lenta.
1400034779|5.0|Loved this book! Didn't want it to end. It's a quick read. I was enjoying the book so much that about 1/3 of the way through it I went out and bought the other three in the series. (they all read as independent books, though - you don't need to have read one to read the others). Loaned this to my mom - she was clamoring for the other three books by about halfway through the first one. Big big thumbs up!
