B0076DCT2G|5.0|Before I bought this, I read many of the reviews and was surprised by all of the negative comments but I trusted the author and got it anyway. Boy am I glad I did!  What a timely topic and there was so many twists and turns that I did not anticipate in getting to the expected outcome.  John Corey's quick wit and snide remarks had me laughing out loud. I feel this is one of his best. I look forward to the next installment.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Great show, the product was exactly what I expected and more.  Unaired scenes were included in this copy and were great to watch.
B000002LAB|2.0|It's truly a waste of money. I will probably never listen to it again. One of those things an artist does simply for money. There's nothing of Miles genius in this. Boring.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I received the item as ordered. The only negative was the inability to track the status of the order.  ok
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a great series - lots of nice twists that pull from stories we knew as children. Wish it would've been available when my boys were younger!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|One of the best TV series I have ever watched. Fantastic acting, loved the characters, very interesting storyline. Am waiting for the last season to be added to Amazon Prime Instant Video to finish watching it all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This s a good solitaire game, fun to play. Easy to play, can choose the a new back ground which is nice.

B004JHYRAE|5.0|I had heard of this book from a friend and have been using it to explore my poly nature successfully. This edition has been updated quite a few times since it was first published a great while ago. I think anyone that has unanswered questions about themselves will find it a good read.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I can not imagine anyone not liking this movie. Base on a true story. Very inspirational. There are still good people out there.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The graphics are beautiful! I have just started the game and it is all I hoped it would be. I love hidden object and puzzle games of which this has both. It is working well on my kindle fire. Enjoy!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|This movie is great for all ages. We loved it. Our youngest is 2 and our oldest is 15 and everyone enjoyed watching it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Always s good read with just enough humor added to a serious story which was believable. Thank you Nelson DeMille!!!

B002ZG976U|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again. I never get tired of it. Cher has always been my all time fav.
B006OEPITO|5.0|I originally read this book in high school over ten years ago. I read it very quickly, actually too quickly. However, the message of this book has always resonated with me on deeper levels. I recently am drawn to this book again, and reading it again I feel that I am reading it for the first time. The amount of wisdom contained in this novel is wonderous. I know many may say its just a fictional story, but the story of Siddhartha (and Govinda) is the story of most (if not all) of human kind. We are all on the search for something. Many think they have the answer, but there in lies the problem. We only need to listen. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|i would have bought this movie. i liked it a lot. but it doesnt have a \\"digital copy\\", so i wont buy it, or any other that doesnt have \\"digital copy\\" that isnt \\"ultraviolet\\". no they arent the same. stop trying to convince me otherwise.<br /><br />i use itunes. im only interested in using itunes. i will not download an app to watch movies with. i will not use a separate system for using, downloading, or watching movies.<br /><br />if you cant stick with what im used to, and with what I want, as a show of appreciation for customers, i will NOT buy your movies.<br /><br />either work with itunes, and allow me to use the system im used to, or lose money that i would have otherwise gladly given to you.<br /><br />this goes for every other movie that doesnt include a \\"digital copy\\" that works with itunes.
1451695195|5.0|I read the book in the span of a few days. I was drawn to it by the newsweek article published a few months ago. The book was shorter than I expected, but its insight was no less beautiful. I appreciate Dr. Alexander sharing his experience and although there will be many who doubt the validity of his experience, I see no reason to. His story was fascinating and I have the deepest gratitude for him making such a recovery and coming back to us to relate his story.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|We have a 6 week old newborn and this wipes case has been perfect for our use. The slim design makes this easy to store in our diaper bag and it holds plenty of wipes for our needs.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Omg I loophole interest it is so cool and fun to show the things u like and is awesomer than Facebook or instances not to mention Twitter
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This music is still great to this day. The songs are really addicting, and I've been listening to it nonstop.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|We really enjoyed Hope Springs. It's a great movie to watch with your mate. My husband and I watched it on a &#34;date night.&#34; The streaming was wonderful.
B0000C1733|5.0|Great music at a great price. I just wish it had &#34;can't stop&#34;, but overall a worthy buy. I would recommend this to any fan of music.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|JUST WOW! Just finished this amazing book, and JUST WOW! I need time to process it all. Beautiful, romantic, heart wrenching......read it!<br /><br />I think I am ready......<br /><br />This is one of if not the most beautiful love stories I have ever read. This is also one of the most real raw emotional reads I have ever read. It made my heart ache in the worst of ways and in the most beautiful ways it made it full of hope. Sky and Holder will stay with you long after the story is over. I just can't seem to find the words that will do this book justice......
0061928356|5.0|Beautiful, compelling and memorable. Just the sort of book you want around in this freezing weather, cause you can't put it down.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I missed 2 episodes in a season and couldn't find them anywhere.  I didn't know this service was available from Amazon.  It was great!  For less than $6 I'm up-to-date and ready for the next season.  Thanks!
0451520750|4.0|They sent me the wrong book but they were quick to contact me and offer to refund my money AND told me not to worry about sending the book back so that I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle. Wrong item, Good service.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Even after 6 seasons Supernatural continues to excite.  Spooky, funny, sad, heartfelt it's all there.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll see Leviathans, you'll see Dean shirtless (worth the price alone)...<br /><br />Season 7 puts you right inside the everyday inferno life of monster hunters Sam and Dean and, to its credit, never turns down the heat.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I think the book was well written. I wasn't, however, much impressed with the content. I am now convinced that Marilyn Manson was not joking when he stated that it was a good thing he became a famous rock star or he might have become a serial killer - I am pretty positive he was serious (especially if he had some friends to participate). The book was full of disgusting and depressing things, and I felt he was ignorantly pretty proud of them. I can sympathize with him over his anger towards Christianity. On a more extreme note, he seemed pretty proud of wanting to kill others who annoyed him (and not having guilt about it), and about doing so many drugs, and he seemed very proud of his relationship with Trent Reznor. I understand he had a difficult life, to a degree (don't we all in one way or another), but I got a real sense of him being a narcissistic sociopath - except for his apparent deep feelings for Trent Reznor. There were some good points to his story, but for the most part - yuck. I don't see him as a mix between the extremes of Marilyn and Charles - I see him atleast 90%leaning towards the Manson side, so his name, to me, doesn't represent him well. As far as \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" goes, I don't see that he ever made it out of his hell by the end of the book? Anyway, I give it a 4 because I am glad I read it & do feel it was well-written. However, if I rated him as a person, it'd be much less. As much as I do like many of Manson's songs I will probably now break the cds ... I will not look at him the same as I once did. I'm glad I know he is not the impressive artist I once considered him to be.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it, great book, cannot wait to see the movie, easy and quick lighthearted read, a little bit of a thriller.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|this animation is really good one from dc im going to watch part 2 soon that would nice too .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book. A must read book. Once u start it it is hard to put down.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B009B50QOU|1.0|Green Day is no longer the band that my parents wouldn't let me listen to when I was 9 years old. Dookie and Insomniac remain two of my favorite records of all time. Nimrod had some awesome songs, and I even appreciated much of Warning. American Idiot was confusing, but I still liked it because Green Day was back. 21st Century Breakdown was...bad. These three new records confirm that the band that my parents wouldn't let me listen to when I was 9 years old is gone, and gone for good. Some band grow and evolve and somehow remain engaging after long periods of time. Some bands, on the other hand, seem to give up, grow tired and boring. Green Day falls into the latter category. It's not that I'm resistant to change. This music just sucks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome best game ever been created for kindle fire hd<br /><br />IF I GAIVE IT A 1 or 100 I would give a 10000000
076115678X|3.0|The book is well written and arrived in excellent condition, but the CD-rom that was supposed to come with it is missing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I just started playing it and am addicted already! Feels like I have my very own horse. The graphics are great and I find myself continuously playing!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I did not like Jillian before purchasing The Shred. Now, I'm a Jillian addict. The way she sets her workouts are amazing. I saw results within a few days.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I only read this book in three days! It so wonderfully written. I love how the author wrote both girl and boy parts and still captured that love between them. Fantastic.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|While it has Bourne in the title and throws numerous references to Jason Bourne and has many of the same cast it falls far short of the Bourne Trilogy.  The movie starts out exciting and fast paced, but eventually somewhere along the way it just falls flat.  it has a horrible ending and the plot of the movie made little to no sense at all.  If you're familiar with Anime just imagine Dragonball Z with villains that just keep getting more ridiculously powerful it is absurd what they come up with at times.  That is how I felt about this movie as halfway through they basically release a Wolverine type clone from the X-men movies to chase down Jeremy Renner's character.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Awesome tales.  Lots of fun!!!  Great reading too.  Love it, love it, love it!!! Recommend it highly to every person.!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris has put his heart and soul into this book. I've only just begun to prepare the recipes, but his approach to teaching and learning gives me hope for the future of education. Learning becomes more about buildings and less about students every year. Ferris has studied what makes people give up trying to learn to cook and addressed the issues. Even a guy like me who has tried and failed to develop comfort with food preparation can be impressive with his approach. It is a joy to read and use.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Best show, wish it would continue. great picture quality. Hope the have gossip girl 2 coming out for a long running show.
B00846REIS|5.0|I could not put this book down. I absolutely loved it.  It was a well written book.  I wasn't in it for the erotic scenes or anything, I loved it for the story.  I couldn't wait to read the sequel.  You can read my full review on my blog! [...]
B009AMAMF2|4.0|Indeed, it _is_ a confusing film if you watch it without either reading the novel or the synopsis on Wikipedia, first. Purist will say that a film should be able to stand on its own without having to read up on it, first--which I tend to agree with--but sometimes to enjoy a story, especially one _this_ \\"scopy\\", you need to know the background, first.<br /><br />I would vote this one a keeper, but not a must-have movie. (That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.) If nothing else, buy the soundtrack--now _that's_ a must-have!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I fell completely in Love with Travis.  The story line kept me not wanting to put the book down.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|'Dredd' has more in common with prime 1970s product such as 'The Taking Of Pelham 123' and 'Dog Day Afternoon' than the much-reviled 1995 Stallone adaptation.<br /><br />Every place on the web that talks about it is talking about an amazingly sharp and entertaining movie whose indifferent box-office reception is baffling. Well it isn't baffling - just the result of a poor (and possibly under-funded) marketing campaign.<br /><br />Dredd newbies will find themselves swept quickly into the action with minimal preface; Dredd comic fans will recognise their hero immediately. And to those complaining that Mega City 1 isn't rendered with all the painstaking expense of the Stallone movie - remember that this is exactly why 'Dredd' has the room to be breathtakingly violent and memorable; there's no way the producers could have brought us something this gritty and particular with $150m worth of producers breathing down their necks.<br /><br />That said, the urban CGI is amongst the most flawless I've ever seen of its type; and that's typical of this movie, which knows its limits but is determined to max out within them.<br /><br />'Dredd' is lean, mean and moody, just like its hero. Karl Urban captures all of the minimalism of the classic comic character, and the script mercifully keeps our favourite future-cop away from either saving the world or being redeemed from his semi-fascist roots. The only fault one can find with this movie is that it almost echoes the central character's talent for understatement - when 'Yeah' becomes a classic line, it's as if a young Dirty Harry is back in a new movie (and Harry Callahan was the inspiration for Judge Dredd in the 1970s).<br /><br />This film has a welcome excess of attitude and atmosphere to back up its frank violence and narrative sparsity. It's a simple tale, expertly told, and well-deserving of a (sadly unlikely) sequel.<br /><br />The pleasantest surprise of 2012, and very highly recommended.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie and the blu-ray resolution is amazing! Great deal compared to many other stores!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was introduced to this series during my vacation. I watched seasons one and two within a three day period, and quickly looked for season three. The story and characters so far have the same intrigue as the previous episodes. Well done, Masterpiece Theater!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|good action and a nice dystopian twist on the original. If you are looking for brain-doritos, a crispy snack with not a whole lot of intrinsic value, this is a good filler.
B00181JGI2|1.0|I was at the Red Roof Inn and the wifi system is so weak that I wasn't able to stream the movie on my Kindle Fire. My $2.99 was wasted.
B009HELT3C|2.0|The story had a good idea, but it didn't follow through. I think it has the same problem as Terminator 3,4,5,etc... It is a new movie, but nothing new is really happening...save the world from the evil bad guy. I just thought the characters(good/evil)  weren't set up to make you root for or against them.
B000N8LWHE|5.0|A classic beautiful scenery I'm thinking the background was not real oh!!! But it was breathtaking someplace you would like to call home
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The size of this mouse is perfect for my hand and the weight of it feels just right in my hand. All the buttons on it are easy reachable without having to make any awkward hand movements and its really easy to bind keys to the buttons on the mouse through the use of the driver software that comes with the mouse once you connect it into your computer and laptop. only con i have with it is that the colors don't change through out the whole mouse as it only effects the logo. while this is a minor cosmetic flaw i feel the product would have a better value if the whole mouse changed color as the logo gets covered by your hand when in use and the point of changing colors is lost in my opinion. to me that con doesn't effect how great this mouse is as to me it feels like a 5 star product
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading 8  books I was searching for another one to read and stumbled across this one in the Kindle store. Once I started reading it I couldn't put  it down! I love  the way it kept me glued to every page! Definitely plan on reading another on  of her books!
B009RH9HDS|4.0|The case checks all the blocks. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the mechanism to rotate the case is a little tight. Maybe it will loosen up over time. The outside leather is very smooth. The case fits the Kindle perfectly. I love the bright orange color. The product is also priced right. I strongly recommend this product.
B000W10AEI|1.0|The Blu-ray DVD seems to be only the special features, and there are a lot of them, but I could not find the movies themselves on either disk, and had to go out and buy one, just to watch the actual films.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|5 star because of the witty jokes and I liked it very much.<br />Best book yet another example of the author is definitely the Percy Jackson series which I loved so very much.<br />People who give the book a minus probably have not read this book fully and as others have said \\"It takes at least 5 chapters to actually get into the book.<br /><br />Rick Riordan has been working hard on this book and it actually shows in the way he goes into so much depth.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ book if you are a Rick Riordan fan.<br /><br />5 star from me!! Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This product is a great upgrade for your flashlight.  It is simple to install, easy to set up, and works well the first time.
B001KZVQJI|3.0|The movie works great and all and I love it...however, when I received the Blu Ray, the bottom corner of the case was completely chipped off. This should not have happened... it makes me weary of purchasing any more Blu Rays from here.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game. Easy to use and understand. I like that you can change the settings to personalize your game. The only thing I don't like is all the ad's. I know they have to be there or it wouldn't be free.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|EDge of my seat exciting & disturbing at the same time....will continue to read this author. I loved this book!
B00AYL7OAY|1.0|my credit card got charged when I have credit Amazon tells me I need to use.  also when I clicked to download the app needed to download the song it said I have to many windows open. next time I'll just stare at the sky for an hour and listen to the radio.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very good story and it kept me guessing until the end. Was surprised at the ending but there really could be no other. Hde is an excellent writer!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a great book on Lincoln...especially regarding his political and people prowess.  The author does a great job of bringing to life all the diary entries and letters weaving a complete picture of the feelings, tension, emotions, highs, lows, expectations, relations and attitudes of the times.  Highly recommend!
6300268985|5.0|I love this film! Great irreverent production from the 70s. Only problem is I can't find out what is the screen aspect ratio. I'd prefer the VHS as probably it's less \\"remastered\\" than the DVD but sure don't want to buy a P/S version.
B001ILFUD2|1.0|When I was young I watched this movie for the first time and it scared the krap outta me and I never watched it again I don't know about everybody else but I would never show a young child this movie unless of course he wants to see a dog get attacked by two dobermans so unless you want your child to have nightmares skip this movie.
B0049J3QF4|3.0|We haven't exposed our 2 1/2 year old to too many movies, but thought Cars would be a good one due to its rating and &#34;topic.&#34;. We were pretty disappointed.  We didn't expect a 'G' rated movie to have the language and attitudes that were presented in the movie.  When I say language, I mean words that he doesn't need to be using at 2.5 years....idiot, moron, stupid,etc.  We are fairly certain that at his young age, these words probably did not resonate with him, but that doesn't make it okay for a 'G' rated movie to have that in it.  As far as the car part of the movie, he loved it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Happy customer. As described. Genuine Apple product. No problems, would buy from again. Thumbs up from me. Nuff said. x
B000FC0V3E|4.0|As someone who had not loved the only other 2 Hemingway' s I've read, I was happy  to find this engaging and provocative. Though I doubt I will ever be a great lover of Hemingway' s prose, from this book I've learned to appreciate his ability to craft deep characters and subtly provide insights into their psyches
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This a great story of a teenage girl dealing with cancer in a very teenage way. A real page-turner, I couldn't put it down!
1594135851|5.0|good book, I would buy from this seller again, the book was in good condition when it arrived and it came quickly.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hated this app. It wasnt worth a flip and when I downloaded it,  it didnt even do anything. I would not waste the space.
159413586X|5.0|book was in excellent condition when it arrived. I would recommend this seller again. book also arrived quickly in the mail.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the best Bible Applications in the kindle marketplace. Of all the bible apps I downloaded this is the best. You can change your bible preferences and even hit audio and it will read it to you. I put in my headphones at work. And I have peace listening to the verses I choose.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I can't wait to read all her other books. This book is so emotional. It made me cry... a lot. I absolutely love this book.
B0013FBS20|5.0|One of Will Smith's best so far! If you looking for a thrill/scifi action then you must buy this one, by far is definitely a must to collect in your SciFi collections!! The blu ray quality is awesome!!!!
B00402FGE4|5.0|Bought it for hubby's Christmas present.  A real hit!  He was thrilled.  Hard to find in stores, but glad Amazon had it.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Russ Crowe is great in this movie. The bluray quality is excellent! The sound on this bluray movie is clarity at its best. A must own for those of you looking for drama/action as Crowe does it at his best!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was very relatable for anyone looking back on their time in high school.  I thought it was very clever to make the whole book letters to an anonymous recipient.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|This book was extremely well threaded together.  It was a little predictable, but it was a great and easy read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book, if I had to sum it up in one word... breathless! This book made me laugh and most definitely made me cry. It spawned thoughts in my head and heart. It left me wanting more; more tears, more laughter... I caught myself give off a huge sigh on the last page. Breathless, I felt I held my breath through the entire story. Hats off to you Colleen Hoover I enjoyed this book very much.
0743201140|5.0|I loved this book, especially how it ask you questions and make you think about your own positive strengths.  And how you get to write it down, stand back and look at it, and learn some new stuff about your own self.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I thought the first book was better, but I am looking forward to the third book of the trilogy where I hope he rounds out the character of Carla.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Ok...great book for defining words.....what more can I say...good dictionary...great for looking up unknown words...good book lots of words lol
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Well done...both entertaining and somewhate educational...provides good insite to what it was like to live in England during the early 1900's...
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love it!  Our kids love it.<br />Will Ferrell is great.<br />Best scene is topping the tree...<br />Nothing bad to say about the movie at all.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|This DVD reminds me somewhat of &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; - a more modern version, but equally classy and envolving. Very good.<br /><br />MH
B001706I5I|5.0|Our son begs to watch this every year at the holidays (and sometimes in the summer too).  Carey's personality, voice and animated features makes the Grinch come to life for us all.
0446581356|3.0|This book gives you basics and I do think that anyone interested in the field of makeup artistry should know the basics but I would liked to have seen more information for those that are a little more advanced. Industry insider tips would have also been amazing. This book is like Makeup 101. I read the first half of the book then became bored and decided that those were things I already knew.Still a great book though.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|We really liked the concept of the movie.  Not an average screen play.  JT was good in it and would recommend it to a friend to rent.
0316069434|5.0|An annual treat is reading Connelly's book.  I think this stands as one of his better efforts.  Harry remains a fascinating character.  There is greater focus on his life as a father.  The story is ordinary but a pleasure to read.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|We enjoyed watching the movie as much as our 7 year old!  Mr. Brolin surprised us!  It was really enjoyable!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once you start this book it compels you to keep reading as the plot thickens and you realize things are not what they seem to be. After the final chapter, I kept thinking about the ending for a very long time.<br />Kitty Girl
B007JRU2UK|5.0|This movie was fantastic in so many ways.  The story was interesting.  The characters were completely believable, and George was brilliant in it.  Flaws and all...One of the best movies I've seen.
6305428387|5.0|Automatic five stars because the DVD showed me Cool Runnings when I put it in my DVD player.  I wish there were some cool extra features, but even without them, you're still getting Cool Runnings, and that should be good enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is well written. Although it tackles a tough subject matter, Hoover does a great job of writing two teen characters who are able to be very vulnerable and real with each other precisely because of their difficult circumstances, but who still very much seem like teens who are having to make life altering decisions rather than adults being labeled as teens. Way to go Hoover! My heart broke for all of the characters in the book. I cried. I loved it!
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids like it they really do enjoy playing the game no complaints recommed it to other parents diffently keeps them busy when your out.
B009329Y30|4.0|It gets to your heart. The performance of the Main actor could have being more realistic but the story kicks ass.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All three of my daughters even the little one likes to play this game it's alot of fun according to them.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|great movie, but i wish they would have included ALL of the songs.  There is only the acapella once on here.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I really enjoy this album.  Brandi Carlile can really belt it out.  She imbues the emotionality into her amazing vocals.  Two thumbs up.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written story with believable characters. The plot freshly in right from the start. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy mystery, historical fiction, and WWII era pieces. Thank you Kate Morton for the great experience!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He enjoyed it & he use to watch the cartoons as a kid & enjoyed this as a reminder.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|The USA channel has produced many really great shows over the years and Suits turned out to be one of those.  I really enjoy the characters.  Looking forward to more seasons.<br />The DVD's were in great condition and arrived on time.
B004G600A4|5.0|Now, I'm only picking up bits and pieces here, of course. Overprotective mother, forbidden road trip. I mean, this is serious stuff. But let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure, that's good. Healthy, even.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This app is awesome if yu want a way to make notes, highlight, make notes, and folders on a pdf.  It is an awesome app for students.  This does work with Kindle HD.  I am a full time MLT student and I use my kindle HD in class.  After converting my powerpoints into a pdf file I import into my kindle.  I can then make notes, highlight, etc using this app.  I highly recommend for students.  My only complaint is that the version that is available on the kindle website does not allow you to download directly from google docs.

0756686970|5.0|Super product Star Wars, nice book, low price (9,88 $ not too much) , fast shipping !<br />Decorative Bookshelf<br /><br />Thanks
0425263916|5.0|The book arrived 3 days after it was published, which was 7 days earlier than the expected delivery date, thanks Amazon! I love this series 10x more than the 50 Shades of Grey series, much less kinky gross stuff that made me a bit uncomfortable. This is a love story about 2 people who come together after both suffering horrible tragedies as young kids, so cute, I loved it. Can't wait for the 3rd book!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I'm a first-time K-240 user and I was totally blown away by the sound effect of this studio monitor. It produces accurate, crystal clear mids and highs, and its bass is powerful yet non-distorted. The headphones wear really comfortable and the workmanship is great. The only drawback would be the less desire to wear them outdoors due to their considerable size.
B001AW156U|5.0|Since I got these in combo with the Super Grip Premium Silicone Skin, and Grip-iT Analog Stick Covers it has turned my racing around. If your into racing this is a must have when seconds count.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Read the guide still cant open cabinet in office its locked so cant get last piece of clown soooooo frustrated...but fun game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is very similar to the computer version! This game is awesome and has great graphics. My sister and I play this game all the time!!! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|couldn't put it down, read all night until it was done.  Heavy subject matter mixed with humor and love story.
8866130907|5.0|I ordered this one thinking I was ordering the larger size.  This one was too small for me, but Amazon refunded my money and let me keep it.  Since I wasn't going to use it, I gave it to my Sister-In-Law, and she said it's working great for her. It fits right in her purse.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is amazing. I will always read anything she writes. I was looking forward to the release of this book and I was not disappointed.  What a beautiful story.  Made me cry and laugh.
8866130923|5.0|I've always gotten wire boundplanners, but this one is so much more elegant look.  It has a lot of features that my other planners haven't had, such as space to write notes for every week.  My other planners had beautiful pictures, but I'm finding that I don't miss them at all.<br /><br />I would say the only think I'm concerned about is that the elastic that keeps it close will stretche out.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Its amazing how much writing has evolved since the time this book was written.  The plot is simple, the characters are simple but I'm also going to read the follow-on Hucklebury Finn just for grins.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This was one hell of a movie, a gorrie shot em up, cut em up, suppense and alot of action. I kept my covering my eyes and uncovering my eyes and moving alot in my chair. It was hard to believe what one guy went thru just to die of pneumonia in the end. This guy must have been part cat.
B00633W614|5.0|I bought this and the other book in the series together, couldn't set them down until I read both.  Wonderful story, as always.  This author is an amazing story teller.  You won't be disappointed, this book has it all, suspense, romance, danger and adventure.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Another excellent movie, any kid who goes to watch this movie just might think Abe Lincoln had an alter ego. This is one movie I could watch again and again. Loved it even though it had its viloent parts.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I received this as a gift for Christmas after dropping some hints and it has lived up to expectations. Prior to owning this I have gone through the Grado SR-60i, Thinksound MS-01, Akg K271 MkII and the thing they all have in common is that the sound stage isn't very large. The sound quality on all of these are phenomenal but I have always wondered what this soundstage is that people keep mentioning in their reviews across various audio forums. I understand the concept of it and after having all these headphones I just wasn't satisfied since I felt I was missing something in the sound. After finally getting these, I noticed that these are a lot thinner than the K271. The headband suspenders still make them look a bit goofy to wear as a portable but I do so on really cold days since they double nicely as earmuffs. Now getting back to the soundstage, listening to music on this even without a DAC I didn't notice new details that I didn't get from the other headphones but what I really like is how wide the music comes across. I'd almost use the word 3D to describe it since some instruments seem to come from behind you. This is the soundstage everyone has been raving about and I would say these are my favorite pair of headphones to listen to out of the 4 I own. People say that the Grado is better for rock and while I find no flaws with the Grado, I actually find myself enjoying classic rock on these headphones more since it feels like you are listening to music in a large auditorium vs a small room. It doesn't have the nice velour pads or the coiled cable like the K271 but the parts are interchangeable thankfully. I did stick with the leather earpads and find those just as comfortable. I thought with the Semi-Open design, not as much sound would leak out but these leak about as much as the Grados, but like the Grados, I still use these in the library regardless. People would have to be sitting right next to you to have it really be bothersome.<br /><br />-Michael
B00932A6G4|2.0|The movie was stupid, good effects but I just dont care for digitally enhanced movies. It make is to cartoonie like.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Such a great app to allow me to carry my Kindle collection on my new smartphone..so I can download my books on a 3g connection when I'm out of range for my Kindle FireLove it.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|If you watch the show Once upon a time, you will like this movie. Its kind of a love story with some violence. I would watch this again
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was a replacement for a 1 year old charger for a Kindle Fire. The old one had stopped fully charging, but Amazon quickly sent out this high quality replacement at no charge. Now I can fully enjoy my Kindle Fire like it was new.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was recommended by a friend.  - Twist and turns at every few pages.  You wonder what can happen next?  Surprize ending.

B0029F2F6G|5.0|Although I have not read this edition, D.H. Lawrence is one of my favorite authors so I must give it 5 stars. Glad to have this collection in my Kindle library.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Didn't like this one as much.  Don't like the idea of her being betrayed as weak so often in the book.  It was a good read however I liked the twist in the plot and hope the movie can do justice.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|the hard thing is, the book is about 50% about the character's thoughts...which is really hard to portray in a movie. so they did a good job with what they had to work with.  but a vast majority of the story was lost
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very informative. Good read.  I enjoy reading about our history. This gave insight to our executive branch and the personalities of the subjects.
0618001905|5.0|I really liked the book. Got what i expected and at the time I needed it. I definitely recommend it!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|It was a wonderful story. Looking forward to the last book of the trilogy. I gave this book only 3 stars because it would have been better with at least 100 less pages. The book has so many characters it was difficult to keep track of who as who even with the list of characters and who they were in the back of the book. All the details weren't necessary. A good story got lost in the details.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I'm not a big Rod Stewart fan but bought it because it was a good deal and found that I like it very much!  I actually burned some copies and gave them to the females at the family Christmas party. The variety of music and the duets with other artists makes it appealing to all.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great little no-frills app on my Kindle. Others have complained about the video ads - just hit the back button when they start to run, and they're gone! No big deal!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A standard app with a couple bells on it, but it functions and I enjoy the enlarged numbers. I would say I love it, but it's a calculator and I'm not all that fond of math.
B000V698JM|5.0|The album was truly a &#34;turning point&#34; in modern blues. Mayall moved away from classic electric Guitar (Chicago style) blues, adding elements of jazz, including acoustic guitar, sax & flute.  Very fine listening.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I was excited to receive this DVD set, as I just started watching the show....when it arrived, I was saddened by the first episode that skipped, angered by the second episode that did not play at all, and now completely disappointed that each disc has at LEAST one episode that does not play, and/or skips most of the episode.  Very disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Has complete text, but in my device, Pandigital Novel (white), it's very hard to jump to where you want to go.  No search either.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is an extraordinarily well-written and acted film.  It has a child-likeness to it that is very appealing.  It reminds you of ways that you might have imagined you would like to express yourself.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|this was the best Wes Anderson movie I've seen since Rushmore. yay. i liked the benjamin britten soundtrack. And noah's flood.
B007S3S8HO|5.0|I know, it's Angry Birds. However, add the KNEX aspect and you have hands on, engineering based learning. My kids found out about Angry Birds by playing it on Kindle, but when I saw this I really wanted to see if the physics of the game stood up to real life testing. And, for the younger sect the answer is \\"yes\\". This game is actually more about the \\"building\\" than \\"destroying\\". It takes effort to build the structures, you have to really think about where you want the pieces to go. Then, it takes strategy to figure out how and when to aim to get the knock down that you desire.<br />I would say any kids that can play with Legos (not Duplo blocks) would be a good fit. Like most KNEX products, the product is sturdy and well built. I would call this perfect for the 5 - 10 age range. And older child would probably need to be an Angry Bird or KNEX fanatic to really enjoy it. But, the 5 - 10 group can have fun while learning a lot about structures. Has really good replay value and can be combined with other KNEX kits for some really fun building possibilities.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Downloads were very easy and quick. I have Att e-mail but use yahoo to get my mail. 3 more words.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Nice too relax  to.  Just try not too send too much timme on it  Take breaks  Keep postings  nice  and lite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Sky and Holder were such great characters. I want a Holder in my life.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Mostly your typical farming style game.  It does have IAPs so be aware.  Otherwise I love the dragons... the quests are mostly worth the effort... and you do not need $ to advance in this game, just patience.  Plus you have an opportunity to gain the gold three at a time each day... sooo much better than some of these other games where you only gain gold by purchasing it with your real, hard earned money.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Robert Preston of course, defines Professor Harold Hill. i have not had toe pleasure of seeing the Matt Broderick version, but can't imagine he could outperform Mr. Preston. The entire cast is stellar. My boyfriend, who's not familiar with musicals, fell in love with this one.<br /><br />Love the Buffalo  Bills! Good Night Ladies/Pick A Little, Talk a Little is tops!
B009G3T01M|5.0|I just think his message is so needed for today.  It's fresh and positive.  He's not afraid to talk about REAL issues that our society faces.  I have so much respect for him and I hope he continues to inspire and challenge all while sounding AMAZING!
B00005JKHN|5.0|This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations.  No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I usually read only just before bedtime and then have back up a page or two to remember events.  This book was so interesting I was thinking about it during the day.  No nightly review necessary.  I bought the next book of the series primarily because I was not ready to say goodbye to the characters.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations.  No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|It was an interesting literary science fiction romp. The stuff about Google was fabulous. The characters were really fun. I enjoyed it.
057540261X|5.0|This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations.  No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really like this series.  Story lines are well thought out, characters are well acted.  I love shows and movies set in the past.
B00185EENU|5.0|An uncomfortable era, a police state, a man with a career within the internal security arm runs into something he is not prepared for-- his own conscience.  The lead actor was an actor under that police state, and brings truth and reality to the story, making it an honest telling of the times.<br /><br />Worth watching for the taste it leaves in your mouth, and how it lets you see what leads to what, and how things go when everyone is afraid.<br /><br />Not a nice, easy movie, this one has real meat in the story.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is one of the best versions of Les Miserables I've ever heard.  I am thrilled with it, highly recommend!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|A pretty predictable story line. The real action occurs later in the book, and is suspenseful. The surprise at the end is worth the read.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Falling Skies is an amazing series. The setting of post-invasion lets you see the characters if Earth lost, but was still fighting. Great over-arching plot as well as great writing and characterization make this series well worth it. The cast is excellent and really comes together to flesh out their characters and their world. I can't wait for the next season to be available to see what happens next.
B00A8LRIEW|5.0|Its incredibly sad its taken nearly 7 years for this album to be released and that for the past year and a half it was shelved in legal limbo.<br /><br />If you love \\"True Faith\\" or the singles from Technique like \\"Run\\" or \\"Round & Round\\", simply listen to the first three tracks of this release and see how they are similar in both lasting impressions and greatness.<br /><br />\\"I'll Stay With You\\", \\"Sugarcane\\" and \\"Recoil\\" could just easily be released as \\"new\\" singles in 2013 and none would give a second thought.<br /><br />I only hope and pray that the band overcomes their bitterness and re-group - The World really needs great artists capable of creating music that will stand the test of time. They should be seen in the same league as U2, The Rolling Stones, and Depeche Mode.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never has a show captured my attention and, actually kept me on the edge of my seat, as this one has.  I feel as though I know the characters personally and mourn their losses and setbacks.  I know this show will never make me laugh, nor is it supposed to,  but I do know it will keep me riveted to the TV.  Very much looking forward to Season 3 part 2.
0316069434|5.0|Fast paced, a few surprises, overall the Connelly style still remains fun to read, nothing deep here, but sometimes that is what you want.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I love the Bourne series.  And Jeremy Renner usually does a great job.  However, the change of cast (which does fit the story) took away from what I really liked about the Bourne series.  For me I think it was too much of a change in the dialogue ... there was just too much of it and not enough &#34;Bourne.&#34;  Overall, it was good.  It's just not what I loved before.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good solid Grisham read.  Would have liked a little more at the end.  Took a while to figure out  .......oops.  won't say any more.  Easy read in Grisham style.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've tried a lot of different office apps for my Android smartphone but this is the only one I would recommend to others. It is great for working with Excel spreadsheets.
B000NY12LO|5.0|...and, maybe every age appropriate child should read this, too. In the light of the Sandy Hook School shootings, and the ever increasing problems regarding gun control and school bullying, this book is a must read. I read it before, when it first came out, but found it just, if not more relevant today, than upon my 1st reading.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|i am an adult and it was a game for younger people..the game just annoyed me..i enjoy adult games that was more for my grandchildren.
B003O86FMW|4.0|For stars is my review for the Hunger games second book Catching Fire. Although it doesn't quite measure up to the Hunger Games it was enjoyable
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Good album all around. Got it tor the song ho. Hey I Was pleased that the rest of the album
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Please read this book!  It is not a romance but is so much a book about love.  It will be a very long time before you forget the characters and their story.......
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time. I had to get this on blue ray. I loan to get the other seasons ss well.
B000ZN8036|5.0|I am still amazed by this story after all these years.  I read many years ago and now own the book and feel like they did a great job making the movie.  It is fun to see a movie be made by a director(Sean Penn) and many actors that truly cared about the story being told the right way.
B002VKB0M4|3.0|I like Juliette Binoche in almost any movie and it's always a pleasure to catch glimpses of Paris other than the standard touristy ones.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I love the West Wing, but the duplication of these discs is terrible.  Many of the discs have scratches and skips.  It is so frustrating to pay good money for this wonderful show, but then have to miss sections of the show because the disc is garbled.
B00871C09S|4.0|I like it mainly because it's like comfort food -- it can be revisited again and again and it doesn't disappoint.
B00AOB3FES|5.0|One of Disney's best. From the songs to the characters to the animation this is an excellent cartoon feature for all ages.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The book is a very interesting take on dystopian writing that will leave you wanting more. Lois Lowry has expertly crafted interesting characters and a solid plot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She managed to tell the story of the destruction of every great society in world history. The similaries with modern day politics in American today is uncanny. The fact that this book is aimed at a younger audience is truely remarkable. With hope she my help to create a more liberal progressive world.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app works just fine, despite what you may hear. So far I've been able to download music videos with ease and it has never messed up for me. Sometimes it downloads the thumbnail as we'll as the video but it takes one second to delete! So my opinion, get this app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|She weaves a tale, worthy of Steinbeck, she builds a story which requires you to reread book number 1. I couldn't put it down
0399213015|2.0|thought this book was regular size!! not sure i will buy online again when i can purchase at a book store
B004J64QSI|4.0|this was a good gift.  it was well received.  it was a good price.  we like it.  that is all
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Looking forward to enjoying more of their novel's.<br />I have read several of Preston and Child books and I have several yet to be enjoyed.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Bought this to go on my new Britax B-Agile stroller (which I purchased in Red and also LOVE) and it works perfectly.  The only thing that I am no so fond of is the drink holder and getting my hot beveredge in and out of it as it is a bit ackward and always afraid I might spill it.  Good for water and drink bottles though.  If you want a holder for hot beveredges, I suggest getting a separate cup holder.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was not quite love a first sight or at least she is not sure it was.  But remember to give life and love a chance.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding monsters is the best game ever! Idk why anyone would would put a bad review. A must have app!
B0063IH60K|3.0|I use solitaire as a way to pass time.  This is pretty much a no brainer game to play.  Movement of the cards is not real fast, but it works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|7 year old is loving taking care of her horse. She is so excited to purchase a new horse. I would like to see more apps like this one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book has gotten so much hype it hardly needs my review, but I feel the need to say that it is, for once, a book deserving of the hype.  Few biographers have gotten such intimate and unfettered access to their subject, especially during his final illness, and the picture that emerges is complex and complete, a giant-warts-and-all view of an exceptional, one-of-a-kind human being.  It's unusual to find a biography that you simply can't put down, but that's what this is.  You don't have to be a techie to enjoy this highly readable account of a man who, to this day, remains an enigma to nearly all of us who ever met him.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Truthfully, I was really excited about this book because I was such a Harry Potter fan. But this book got a little creepy at times and I'm still not quite sure what the message was. Rowling does a good job with her descriptors and painting a picture of who her characters are, I just didn't feel an underlying message. Worth a read though - certainly a different side to our Harry Potter author.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book is very interesting and a very nice read.  And it is really a series of short stories about the relationships between modern Presidents starting with Harry Truman.  A lot of historical books get too much into trying to psychoanalyze the historical figures.  This book is simply well researched historical detail and it pieces together the recent history of the Presidents Club.  It doesn't try to over sensationalize aspects of these figures that are at times pretty sensational.  And it is really interesting to see the human side of these very successful but also very flawed people.<br /><br />I find that with a lot of historical books, for as much as I like reading them, I start them and because they are not always well written, I put them down for a while.  And then when I drum up the courage to take them on, I plunge through until I finish them.  This book grabs your interest from the first page.  And because they are like short stories, it is easy to put them down at points and pick them up again without losing the thread.<br /><br />I have learned a great deal I didn't know but should have.  I would highly recommend to anyone interested in any of the modern Presidents from Truman on
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is one of my favorite bands. They're one of the classics. This album has the most songs that I enjoy listening to of theirs.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|It has been approximately 26 years since I stayed up all night reading the graphic novel, unable to put it down.  It is excellent.  It's all I hoped for.  If you like Batman stories at all, this is the one.
0425252868|4.0|Beginning from the middle of the story,  Makos transports us back to one side of the incredible event, then sends us back to the others' point of view. A fabulous walk through the air war of World War II. From how these two aviators were raised and got into flying through their emotional &#34;reunion&#34; well after WWII's end, the reader will be kept on a high interest level.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|First off, this book would have gotten at least a 4 star rating from me, had it not been for the last 2-3 pages of the book.<br />If someone had told me the book would have included spirits and ghosts,<br />I definitely would not have read this book as I am sensitive to spiritistic stories,<br />no matter how lovey dovey the story is.<br />The story ends with Katie finding out that her new best friend and next door \\"neighbor\\", Jo, is actually a spirit (or ghost) of Alex's dead wife.<br />How creepy and distasteful.<br />I had nightmares last night and returned the book for a refund.<br />This was my first (and last) Sparks novel, as I will not be reading another one of his books.<br />Other than the creepy factor (spiritistic) this was a really easy and fast read, nice love story between Alex and Katie with some excitement with Katie's alcoholic husband.<br />If spiritistic books do not bother you then you might want to give this book a try, but if you are sensitive like me, then I do not recommend this book at all..
B005WUHAX8|1.0|When I bought this case I was super excited and happy I was getting it for a cheaper price, buts wish I would of just bought it through life proof! Don't buy it from here. Worst decision I made trust me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game soo much<br />It is so FUN!!!<br />U can buy characters and a bunch of other stuff.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|This book is worth checking out. Especially if are interested in psychology at all. Worth the price. First half is a great account of the terrible life of camp
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game.  I like to see how fast it take me to win and see if I can beat my top score.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought two of these, one for work and one for home.  It has a very long cord and seems very sturdy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is great. I love that it give you the verse of the day. I also like that you can share your daily verse on facebook.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|If I were you, I'd download it now.<br /><br />Listen to Missing You, X-Kid, Drama Queen, Amanda. You can't escape how memorable and transcendent they have been; while keeping the songs catchy as hell ... 25 years later. My only gripe? &#34;The Forgotten&#34; sounds too much of Beatles song ... but it's not the first time that Green Day has nodded an homage to other great bands.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I didn't care for &#34;Safe Haven&#34; as much as the rest of Nicholas Sparks' books. I understand that many psychopaths use the Bible as a basis for their behavior, I just felt this was a little over the top. I feel Mr. Sparks took the easy way out to explain the character. I would have preferred a deeper level of explanation.  I also didn't like the ending of &#34;Jo&#34; being an angel, or imagination.The story had too much of a &#34;Sixth Sense&#34; feel.<br />  As usual, I enjoyed the setting of this book, and the story itself. I only read it because I saw the preview for the movie. Now that I have read the book, I'm not sure I will go to the movie. I'm sorry I can't give this book a higher rating. I usually enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books!
B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon is one of my all-time favorites.  The old movies had such class.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone.  Love it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not much of a reader, but this book was so interesting that I couldn't help but read it in a week or so.
B0053KWDES|5.0|The E11 rocks!!! I got it for my Iphone and it made the quality my monster headphones sound significantly better.  It feels like I have a new set of headphones.  I dont know why I didn't get one sooner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ive always loved since one of my best friends had a birthday party and went horse back riding for the first time I love horses now
0525478817|2.0|It seems like a remake of the Nick Sparks book &#34;A walk to remember&#34;.  The names have changed to protect the innocent, some *very minor* story arcs added, and events change order, but all in all the same book.  If you don't like Nick Sparks, you won't like JG.  I'm going to try reading some of his other works to see if there's an original story out there, but this book is a potential lawsuit waiting to happen.
0743289684|4.0|Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  The book  is in very good condition, making it an enjoyable hard cover read.  Thank you.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I thought it was a great movie.  Funny, witty, and definitely hits on *some* issues that gives a seriousness/teachable moment.  I would love to rent this one again - and pay for it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Well worth the money. It is hard to find good games like this to play anymore. You will not be disappointed.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I'm impressed again and thoroughly horrified with the \\"nut house!\\" The writing is brilliant and although it seems like a whole different show, it's starting to tie back to the first season wearing a very clever disguise! Amazing!!
0345803507|5.0|Have always been pleased with books from Amazon.  The prices are usually the best of any provider.  This series was hard to find, but Amazon came through
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have this on my FireHD.<br />At first I wasn't sure if this would be worth it. After several car trips though, I have been convinced. The trips even seemed to go much faster than usual.<br />If you've ever played those bridge building games and enjoyed them, this is very similar.<br />The music, sounds, graphics, and gameplay are all very good.<br />It's very easy to spend too much time playing this, so be careful!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app amazing so many games in one so great gotta get this app way worth free would buy for A dollar great app get
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Originally I only bought this for Radioactive and It's Time, but after listening to the entire CD start to finish, I was pleasantly rewarded with a great CD experience. While the two are still my favorites, the rest of the CD is still great to listen to.<br />I am happy to have this album in my collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing yet heartbreaking read. I cried several times with what the characters go through. I was amazed in the detail and thought of connection between the characters and actual life. Completely mesmerized.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Waited forever for this...First movie rented on Amazon and very happy...Great Streaming!!! Of course who doesn't love the super heroes!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have used it on my desktop for years...wouldn't be with out it! Have used it on my desktop for years...wouldn't be with out it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's just plain fun and entertaining. It makes it easy to locate posting and provides me with a method to which I can reply.<br /><br />I'm excited about it as this has completely changed the way I use my phone. And some of the information is compelling and important to our lives. There are posting that may very well save our lives.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|A little slow to get going, but the pace soon picks up (excuse the pun), and it turns into a thrilling yet very informative read.
B00122BETG|4.0|I have only listened to this album once -- actually found out about it when sampling some new stereo equipment -- the salesman used this album for the sample music and I was instantly hooked. Great lyrics and the usual high quality production that we have come to expect from Donald Fagen since his Steely Dan days. If you are a Fagen/Becker/Steely D fan, you will not be disappointed.
B004123CO4|5.0|I have been doing digital photography for along time but I never read any book on it. The book help me to look more closely about the lighting, the ISO, the flash and the power packs and many more thing that I never look at. I am still reading and it is very informative. I am reading and practicing at the same time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an addictive game that you will not want to stop playing.  You will find yourself rooting for the end of humanity.  It is a game that makes you think.  I highly recommend this game for everyone.
B00A6F9YFQ|4.0|\\"Elysium\\" has definitely grown on me (but still have a hard time getting through \\"Winner\\" and \\"Hold On\\"), but this single contains three bonus tracks that are as good as or better than many of the \\"Elysium\\" tracks.  The weird thing is that for the first time I can remember (I'm old and have been collecting PSB vinyl and CD's since they started) there are some horrible technical problems with the audio on this release - at least one is unintentional and the other two I'm not sure about.<br /><br />Stuart Price's single remix of \\"Memory...\\" begins as if the intro had been carelessly edited by simply cutting off the prior part of the track.  Sounds like someone dropping the needle on a record part way through - sonically inexcusable and careless.  Too bad as the mix is well conceived.  I listened to the digital file and viewed the video, both of which suffer from the same problem.  I can't believe Neil and Chris let this one out before \\"proofing\\" the track - can't recall a major technical flaw like that on any previous PSB recording.<br /><br />\\"Listening\\" is sonically and lyrically perfect (though the synths sound a little one-dimensional - perhaps because this was worked on while on tour?) and one of their best songs period - everything you wish \\"Winner\\" could have been.<br /><br />Then comes \\"One Night\\" - another great song, but marred by vinyl-like noise (pops and clicks) that are especially apparent at the beginning - leading me to believe this was not done intentionally - either way, it detracts from the great production and lyrics. And artificial vinyl noise is sooo five minutes ago...<br /><br />I'm afraid the last annoying glitch may have been intentional - actually \\"glitch\\" sounds are (or were) trendy, and I do know how the Boys like to acknowledge whatever is the latest sonic or dance music trend.  There is a horrible squelchy feedback noise in \\"Inside\\" that jars you out of what begins as a slow, poignant song ala \\"Your Funny Uncle.\\"  I thought it was a flawin the CD or something wrong with my Bluetooth connection, but no...it repeats (at various sound levels) with other off-kilter blips at fairly regular intervals - completely ruining the song.  Could it be a literal interpretation of the song's theme about how the outside doesn't matter (\\"because you're beautiful inside\\")?  If that is the case, they have intentionally made something ugly on the outside for no reason.  Wish I could find a version without the \\"glitches\\" as the song and sentiment are beautiful and would also make for a nice remix.<br /><br />Even if the last two tracks were \\"flawed\\" intentionally, there is no acceptable reason for the sloppy editing of the intro to \\"Memory...\\"  I personally think Andrew Dawson was a poor choice as a producer of PSB and think \\"Elysium\\" is therefore missing their trademark lushness and more subtle production touches, but the bonus tracks were produced by the Boys - guess I will have to look at the latest copy of their fan club magazine for some possible explanation.  Too bad, as the songs included could have made for a perfect CD single.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This is one of those collections that you will read and re-read and re-read.  I first read these books when I was 16 and I have read them again and again.  It is cuddling up with your warmest PJ's and a comfy couch and just reading those familiar pages and falling in love again with Louis, Lestat, and Armand.  It is remembering Baby Jinks and Claudia.  The books in this collection are friends that you don't remember you missed till you see them again.  The vampires are very human and very real in Anne Rice's world.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A very different kind of romance novel but very quickly paced and fun I enjoyed this book very much big thanks to the author
B002COTI64|5.0|Love this album, has some great tracks and I can definitely listen to this one on repeat at the beach or at the pool, any fan of Regina must have this album!
B003F5NSTW|1.0|Couldn't finish this book. The leading lady is completely unlikeable. The prose is annoy and self indulgent and as much as I understand her attitude, I got sick of reading about how much she hates everything.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Love the entire album, have it on repeat right now b/c I just can't get enough.  My favorites are Blue jeans, Video Games, Radio and This Is What Makes Us Girls, overall a great album, highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|just as title says I can not get it to work on the fire.  not sure the problem.  After the second time I downloaded it, it did work right away.  But since then it has not worked at all.  Finally got it on the Ipod and there are no problems.  On the ipod it is fun but would be better on larger screen.
B00005BGV2|2.0|Lateralus is my favorite rock/metal album of all-time. I thought it was about time to get a vinyl version. However, I was extremely disappointed with the sound of this album in picture-disc format. There is an extreme amount of surface noise on the record which includes a constant background hiss and way too many pops and clicks for a new record. In addition, the more complex passages of the album (heavier, louder and layered) sound distorted.<br /><br />It was only after I listened to the record that I really started to research picture discs. In general they are thought to be sub-par sounding and only meant for display. I would agree with this assessment.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go with traditional vinyl whenever possible.
1592402690|2.0|Here, There and Everywhere had the potential to be a great book because of who is writing it.  One would think the guy who engineered some of the most renown music put out by The Beatles would have a great story to tell.  As it is, it is merely an interesting read at times with nothing that would rank it very high amongst the mountain of books written about The Beatles.<br /><br /> As other reviewers have mentioned, it seems this book was written with little or no editing.  Even though a writer was used by Mr. Emerick to assist in writing the book the writing is still very poor.  The biggest mistake in my eyes is the prologue that looks at his first day on the job as recording engineer on Revolver.  In a few paragraphs Mr. Emerick manages to pigeonhole Lennon, Harrison and Starr in rather insulting ways that left me, and I would imagine many others, shaking my head at how shallow and snippy the descriptions of these three are.  The book would have been better without that unnecessary prologue.  Throughout the book are meaningless asides, snippy remarks about John, George and Ringo and even George Martin.  There men were his bread and butter and provided the reason anyone cares about Geof Emerick today.  Much of what he has to say may be true, but it's the way he says it that seems off the mark and unprofessional.<br /><br /> The other issue I have with this book is the complete misrepresentation of the first sessions The Beatles had at EMI.  According to Mr. Emerick Ringo's first session with the band at EMI involved recording How Do You Do It and then the band introducing the song Love Me Do to George Martin for consideration.  The fact is Love Me Do had already been introduced to and recorded by George Martin in a previous session with Pete Best on drums.  (The recording is on the Anthology 1 CD.)  The book indicates George Martin then brings in Andy White, a sessions drummer, because G.M. is not happy with Ringo's drumming on Love Me Do.  The fact is Andy White was at Ringo's first session because G.M. did not like Pete Best's drumming.  The song introduced after recording How Do You Do It was Please Please Me. The is basic Beatle 101 stuff and it bothers me tremendously that someone who claims to have been there gets it wrong, and no one in the process of publishing this book noticed the error. It's almost as though a rough draft was knocked out and the publisher simply printed the rough draft without bothering to look at it.<br /><br /> I'm not going to say avoid this book, there is interesting info in it, but beware that it is factually wrong in places and really needed some serious editing.  Go to your local library if you want to read this.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Super fast shipping got here before the date it was said to be here on. My case is in GREAT condition my dvd is in practical perfect condition no scratches or anything & plays like a gem! love my item and am very pleased with this transaction.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Since 1999, when the original movie was released at the theaters I have been a fan of all things Matrix. My wife, knowing this, bought me the Ultimate Edition on DVD when it came available. I have been devouring it for several years. I thought my appitite for all things matrix was satisfied. So when I heard that The Matrix was being released in BluRay, I really wasn't that excited.  Even though I knew the difference in visual quality was better on BluRay I figured the content was the same. I figured that The Ultimate Collection on BluRay would be just an indulgance.  I, of course, was wrong. I have watched all three BluRay versions of the Matrix Trilogy.  And....WOW. Night and Day.  I am very satisfied with this edition of The Matrix Trilogy.  I haven't really gotten into the rest of the content but I suspect that there will be some surprises there too.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Once when I wasn't near my WiFi connection at home and I was using this app it stopped working and it also never even opened when. I was at my home menu . And this was on my kindle
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Since the Kindle Fire HD can not play flash this is one of the only ways to view some of these things. I use this in conjunction with Dolphin and can view much more than I could before.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I think this book is ok because they don't have many jokes in this book I will tell my friends Cristina
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|awesome movie and a great soundtrack, would recommend it to anyone. great buy! was very pleased with my purchase, thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommended this book for every body over 8-9 a little graphic for some people but I mean really it a great read for every one . It makes you want to keep reading I never wanted it to end  I mean you feel the character. Awesome book
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I luv it so many games in 1 app they are easy to. One of the best apps I have its just wonderful great for littler kids who cant play like that other harder games out there and its not like buy 10 apps you just need 1 for it all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is easy to use but challenging.  I like the unlimited undo feature as it makes it easy to try different strategies.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|freezes every once and a while,but still great app. my daugther play together all the time. we like chaseing the animals down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good and intriguing- anything but a hopeless read.  I thought the characters were nicely portrayed and the book excellent.
B000ITF86E|1.0|McLintock was such a disappointing film.  I watched the film because I thought it would be a great John Wayne western, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot is developed into something that could be good, but it never gets there. If you are looking for a classic western, this is not it. There is really none of the action one comes to expect in the John Wayne movies. The most fighting is a mildly humorous fight in a mudpit and Wayne chasing his wife through town. It could have been good, but it is not. There is a reason this film is in the public domain and free on Youtube. I would never watch this film again. It is a waste of the two hours that you spend viewing it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so amazing. I don't read much, by the sample defiantly got my attention and I read the whole book. I'll be reading the other two books by Colleen Hoover as well! :)
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|This is probably a good book for college sophomores who have never been in very poor countries. But for anyone else it is,well, sophomoric. The authors argue their thesis thoroughly - perhaps too thoroughly - but the make the matter almost simplistic. Yes, agreed, political and economic institutions are critical, but geography can matter. Certain cultural social constructs do have impact.  Most difficult for an informed reader is that the book is just too wordy. I wanted to shout 'I get it, I get it!'
B000YDG5W0|5.0|Great shoe, great way of shopping. i got it even early. thank alot. It was a great experience doing business with you.
B0000AQS6U|3.0|The set met my needs I was hoping it would have a slipcover so that I can keep it in its case but I ended up having to split it up into the original cases that I already had because it had no slip cover
B0096DZKZC|5.0|The graphics are better than episode I. I like the additional button that allows you to team up with tails in different ways. As a lifelong sonic player I was very satisfied with this game :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can't beat the value of this free game.  Challenging at the higher levels, and very addicting.  I would highly recommend!
B007VTVG4C|5.0|I was listening to the listeners's top choices podcast on NPR and this album place very high,  It was noted, however, that it has not sold wildly well.  I have now listened to the whole album and I can understand that if someone has never listened to experiments done in music that this might turn them away. For example, she uses dissonance, atonality, nontraditional instruments, a voice on key that is neverthless moving all over the musical spectrum.  Plus it is wildly emotional. If one only listens to melodious music played and sung the way it has been  for decades, this can be quite jarring.  She even hits tribal music although it sounds like it emanated from the very early Irish instead of Africa.  I think it is a great musical undertaking.  Even the cover art is wonderful.  Apple puts new meaning in the phrase \\"musical artist.\\"  I highly recommend this album.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Fantastic book! A must read! Once I started reading this book I could not put it down.  I have recommended it to all my friends!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It's a good entertainment, fun movie.. a good one time watch.. the movie goes pretty fast and with some good entertainment...this movie is similar to &#34;The Raid: Redemption&#34;..
B007M45PMU|5.0|One the best albums I've heard in awhile. Can't wait for a second album. Will purchase and listen from first song until last
B003RV43X4|5.0|Very well done!! i enjoyed this movie and didn't actually watch them until my husband sat me down and made me.  I glad he did beccause they are pretty awesome!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch novels, I am anxiously awaiting the next one!  Michael Connelly always leaves me wanting more.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Very well done!! i enjoyed this movie and didn't actually watch them until my husband sat me down and made me.  I glad he did beccause they are pretty awesome!
B002MJM8B6|5.0|I didn't know it  was an edited version but perhaps I didn't read the small print. it is still a good purchase.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This i and awsome version of the avengers!! i liked the cast they had really good rapport and that makes the movie even better!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I didn't think I'd be into a series about zombies but this series is excellent. I watched season 1 in a week and immediately ordered season 2. I care about the characters and want them all to be okay and remain safe.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|I'm a little old to be watching these movies but i don't care. this movie was cute and if you have seen the other Ice Age's then this will just continue the series for you.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my grand children and it was very well received.  So I will take their word for it.  I love shopping with amazon so I don't have to go to the stores.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I expected a little more from it, it is definitly a B rated movie.  The plot was a little loose and there really is that much &#34;man dancing&#34;.  but even so it was a bareable movie.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|similar to the rebus format but found the ending could have been better worked. It seemed Ian got bored stiff
B000RUAR5G|5.0|one of the best movies that the 90s spit out!! i stll remember watching this as a kid. great movie!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I have yet to read this story. my wife has read it and enjoyed it , but found the first few chapters a bit tedious. we are off to see the movie on 3d today taking no 5 grandson who is 9. so i doubt if i will read the book later. follow up at 7 p.m. n.z.time. the movie of life of pi was very enjoyable, my wife anne says it was very true to the book. apart from the opening and closing sequences our grandson was enthralled with the story. our older children new the story from thier english literature classes at high school. so my recommendation would be to read the book and after a break see the movie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!
B00A31UXLW|3.0|same predictable format. harry needs to jazz up his life. get abit more action like Harry Hole. needs more lovelife
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this series and i hope that they continue.  It is so different than what is on tv these days, i like that!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book pulls you in from the get-go.  You feel deeply connected to the main character and strongly hope she finds the inner strength needed to move on and establish new relationships in her life.  The fear of her demons from the past rearing their ugly heads keep you at the edge of your seat.  A poignant and perfectly written drama.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I downloaded this on my kindle to read before the movies came out and i loved it! why didn't i read these sooner?!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|A very well written book on head injury's.  On why some people make it and others  don;t<br /> . Good reading
B009NPKTN6|2.0|I though this movie could have been better.  I don't know why i expected so much from it but, i did and now im disapointed.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I really liked the Belkin Classic Case with one exception;  it leave a slight mark on the screen from the hand strap.  It is very well made.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!
B0091LS07E|5.0|I pre-ordered this album and received it on the day it came out. When I put it on my stereo I was floored, Alicia Keys is one artist that continues to shine brightly in her own right. She always seemed to be the type of artist that had an old soul but always ahead of her time,she created her own lane that no one can mimic nor follow. She is has one extraordinary catalog of GREAT music. I have to say that songs like Brand New Me, 101,One Thing,and That's When I Knew are beautiful ballads I can relate them and her pain and emotion in her voice is exquisite. I love how in One Thing and 101 it just feels like it touches you to the soul. It feels as if she is singing to you and you can vision everything she is singing about.One of my favorite songs on Girl On Fire is Listen to Your Heart that song describes pretty much everything I'm going through. Its all about listen to your heart what do you say what does your heart say and follow your heart. I love the message the whole album is great really enjoy it listen to it everyday.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't say enough about this series!! If you love time pieces then sit your booty down in front of your tv and give this series a shot, you won't regret it!!  I'm only to episode 4 and i can't wait for the rest of the season!
B0054EU0H0|5.0|I was very meticulous about cleaning the screen before applying the product and the final appearance is excellent.  A precise match to the screen geometry makes the protective cover hardly noticeable.  I'm most concerned about scratches so this product is just what I need - it appears thick and durable, yet clean and unobtrusive.<br /><br />A note about installation: when orienting the cover on the camera, be sure not to install upside down.  The radii in the upper corners are smaller, so the backing should be removed left to right.  Double check before getting started and it shouldn't be a problem.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Tommy lee jones still has it!! This one is a great one because you get a blast to the past and see agent K & J 's past stories.  This i rate as a must see!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Certainly not as good as the PC version, but is very fun to try anyways. Worth the $7! Being improved every day! Still can't wait for the next update.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|My husband loves this movie.  I liked it more than the others because of the bane story.  Overall this is a must See!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I believe i do not need to talk about how amazing this trilogy is. It's simply godlike. Gotta love everything that came with it too, including the little book and all the special features! I guess it's a little disappointing that i have to wait until summer to have it on my laptop, but until then, I'll stick with the TV (duh).<br /><br />Apart from being a great product, the entire trilogy gives me more and more reasons to have my own demons of vigilantinism
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this series and i hope that they continue.  It is so different than what is on tv these days, i like that!!
B002DJSBL6|4.0|Enjoyable and insightful. The ending was a bit puzzling and left small something to be desired. Yet overall I enjoyed and recommend this as a great to see movie
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love this series and i hope that they continue.  It is so different than what is on tv these days, i like that!!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I hate waiting for people to draw back. Also, i hate how you cant delete a game from the games youre playing.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|i don't subscribe to HBO... but i wish i did because this is torture!! the new season has already aired and i could have already seen the new season, but instead im waiting for Amazon to make it a Amazon Instant watch.  It needs to be a part of the Prime program!! come on amazon talk to HBO, Game of throne fans who are also prime members would be tickled pink!!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|My husband is the one who likes playing video games along with my grandson's....I prefer to read books instead.  I know that this is a great game to play but I am not fond of the sights and sounds of the game.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie, i downloaded the books on my kindle before i went and saw this and i must say they stuck pretty close to the books.
B001FB563E|1.0|After receiving two of these Blue-ray discs back to back and both defective, I won't be buying any videos from Amazon again. It's happened to me before and I know it can happen regardless of where you buy them but it's not the worth the headache you have to go through dealing with Amazon. They where cool with the replacing the original and finally giving me a refund after the second one pulled up lame but I'm still out $2 because I had to buy packaging to ship the original back to Amazon. That's a net loss of 20% overall. On top of that, I came across the same disc in a local &#34;big box' discount retailer for less. In the long run I guess it doesn't pay to make these low cost purchases from Amazon.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I love adult versions of childhood classics!! They are a but more grown up and darker whick makes me fee less dumb for still loving the story of snow white!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this series of books, they have constant suspense and I don't want to stop reading them.  Kudo's to the auther, keep up the good work!
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|this most recent ice age, fits right in with the series and is just as adorable as the first. and is a great movie to watch with the kids!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series of books, they have constant suspense and I don't want to stop reading them.  Kudo's to the auther, keep up the good work!
B00846TTDG|3.0|I took my husband to see this and he really liked it, it stayed pretty true to real life, but because they got real people playing the roles and not actors the acting seems a little off, but what do you expect these people are great at protecting our country not crying on cue!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game, could play for hours and do just that when I have the time, playing against friends and family is fun!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a cute movie, i can't stay away from disney! i'm in my mid twenties and i can't help getting a little pumped to see some of these cutesy movies.  I thought this was a great show and i will watch it again!
1878424939|5.0|The was a great product. Super service. Very fast. Shipping was great. Will use this service again.thank you very much
1609613937|5.0|I have been a vegan for about 3 years now, following the Mcdougall plan. The new book and recipes really add tastier and easier choices, plus more to date solutions. I love the testimonials, brings you back to reality and shows true results that this really isnt a diet but a new way of thinking about your health and well being.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This finely crafted movie transports you to a different era when &#34;the dark arts still hold sway.&#34; The tightly woven plot is intriguing and filled with many things that are not as they seem.  This is my annual &#34;winter&#34; films that's like reading a favorite novel again and again. Terrific acting throughout.
B0086700CM|5.0|i lovehow the longer u go, it speeds up. i recomend this to all of my frends if yhey havnt already downloaded it.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Zepto Labs has created some really enjoyable puzzle games on handheld devices over the past few years.  They went from Cut the Rope's mixture of physics and timing puzzles to Pudding Monsters HD, a game based around simple logic and planning puzzles without a time-based score.<br /><br />I've played a fair amount of CTR in my pursuit to perfect each and every level. While this game doesn't have the same level of challenge from continually improving your time, the varied solutions and simple scoring system encourage gamers of all ages and prior experience to play.  The puzzles are simple, fun, and the animations are very nice.  I highly recommend this game for younger puzzle fans, but it is still very enjoyable for more experienced puzzle aficionados.  There are also a nice variety of levels as there are 24 per world with a total of 4 [incorrectly said 5 in original review] worlds currently I believe. Even if you don't count the easier tutorial levels, that still leaves over 100 puzzles to try.<br /><br />Technical aspects: game has very minimal loading times, looks very nice on HD devices (I play on a Samsung Galaxy S3), controls very fluidly, has easy to understand tutorials and goals, and I have only run into one glitch so far. The glitch I ran into involved an endless loop of attempting to take me to an optional payment area for paid help/cheats.  I had to force close, but once I knew to avoid that link the game has run incredibly smoothly.<br /><br />Demerits: paid help/cheats are a bit unfortunate and could cause issues with children playing, endless loop when accessing that menu, and a bit short if you don't pursue crowns (earn all possible star results in a level).<br /><br />Overall- it's a 4/5 down from my original 5/5.  Still a decent game, but there are some potential issues to keep in mind.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this movie!  I think that this is the best version of this movie. What girl does not want to marry Mr. Darcy!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|This was a near perfect thriller.  Loved every minute of it. And, as someone in the computer security field, let me say that it is a very realistic portrayal of a cyber threat.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This one was ok. The movie will keep you entertained but it is not something you will be talking about with your' buddies. All in all I found it entertaining enough and worth the $3.99 I paid. If I had gone to the movies and paid those RIDICULOUS PRICES, I would not be so kind :)
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I love the Bible.  I just didn't find this one as easy to navigate as I would have liked.  The Bible I really wanted is the King James Version that has put God's name back in where the Tetragrammaton originally appeared.  I think it is appalling that translators have allowed themselves to be guided by a superstition about pronouncing the Divine Name and have instead substituted LORD for the Father's personal name.  How many of us would like it if future generations totally obliterated our name from birth, marriage, census and social security records, not to mention any accomplishments that had been recorded?  It would not give a family historian a true picture of his genealogy.  Taking God's name, Jehovah or Yahweh, from the Bible doesn't give us a complete picture either and leads to misinterpretation and misunderstanding.
0345803493|5.0|Mercy.  You can't help but get heated when you read this series.  I was surprised at how much I didn't know about intimate relationships.  But the characters are ones you'll like to get to know.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I am giving a 4stars because it is a good book! I can´t stop reading it! It has some phrases that touch your nerves! Enjoy!
B0096BIENY|3.0|I like this group but the voices seem to be aging more than I thought.  Nonetheless, I enjoy listening to it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game the only issue I had with it was when I got stuck in the managers office trying to get into the locked cabinet (judging from the reviews i wasnt alone )  the hint button kept sending me in and out of the safe and the guide never said anything about where to get the key (which is in the book on the managers desk on the second page by the way...) luckily someone had left a review explaining where to find it otherwise I was about ready to give up. Once I got passed that glitch the rest of the game was great.
0345803507|5.0|Mercy.  You can't help but get heated when you read this series.  I was surprised at how much I didn't know about intimate relationships.  But the characters are ones you'll like to get to know.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Enjoyed it! Glad it's in my iPad, don't have to share...sometimes people don't return loaned books. Had a hard time putting it Dow.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|It's been said before, this album is great.  Just buy it and support good music or else you will continue to be a sad person who hates everything.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|This game is amazing. It improved everything from the first 2 games. First, the graphics are a giant leap from the older games. The sound is a bit better, but it's still a little above average. There are 72 levels in the game. The levels are more varied, other objects in the background and new obstacles really add some depth to the game. The controls are a bit more sensitive, but overall, great. Some of the new features besides the new obstacles, is that you can buy clothes for your character. It does not change the game in any way, but it makes completing a level feel rewarding. Being able to see the records other people have in a level also makes you want to try to beat a level faster. You can also change bike colors and get better bikes. The jump button is still there, but at least it isn't necessary in every level. Another great change is the checkpoints. They used to respawn you in some weird way, but now it's been fixed and you respawn like you would in this kind of game. It froze on the loading screen once, but no other bugs or glitches to be seen. Definitely worth your money.
0671027344|3.0|They made this into a movie?<br />So it's told in journal entry form and about a whiny high school kid who feels guilty for the death of his aunt which apparently has made him social awkward. He makes some friends and parties, cries a lot and gets into Rocky Horror. That's it.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My daughter had trouble with this game we have for the DS and was not the same, I thought she would enjoy this too but she did not. Hard to understand.
B009B1EOZ6|5.0|Red Vinyl is really the selling point here, something to scare the kids with.<br />The live concert is good!<br />Song selection from the tour is solid while the production sounds very good.<br />IF you like live albums and AC/DC this is a must have.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Who doesn't love this game I download and so much fun glad I can take it with me were ever I go!
B0028ER4QY|4.0|The deal is it's the same as the old original release in the 60's but on a vinyl of a different weight. It sounds great and has classics like, &#34;Hello, I Love You&#34; on it.<br />You even get &#34;The Celebration of The Lizard&#34; printed on the jacket.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|All I know is that my kids love these birds the kindle version is great and mobile love this and suggest for all families.
1401235417|5.0|Who are the owls? Gotham's unseen rulers. Good action and creepiness abound in the first part of this Graphic novel selection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was told so well that I did but at the same time did not see the ending coming! Was an easy read and i enjoyed it a lot!
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|Classic Beatles re released. If you are buying Beatles Vinyl for the first time or Beatles for the first time this is a great choice for the collection. If you're not familiar with the album  here;s a great place to start.<br />28IF
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Every now and again, a movie is beautifully written, acted, directed, set and costumed. This was exquisite. I'm grateful to have seen this one.
B0041KVYIW|5.0|Revolver has a lot of familiar songs on such as Taxman,Elenor Rigby, Yellow Submarine, Good Day Sunshine and my favorite the psychedelic closing track, Tomorrow Never Knows.<br />The sound is great for this classic Beatles album. If you are buying Beatles Vinyl for the first time or Beatles for the first time this is a great choice for the collection.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! I todally recommend  it. The only thing that I don't like about it is that when someone does a drawing for me, my kindle wont notify me!
B0041KVZ18|5.0|The sound is great for this classic Beatles album. If you are buying Beatles Vinyl for the first time or Beatles for the first time this is a great choice for the collection.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|What a great ap ! Great for kids and adults who just want an easy silly laugh ! Recommend highly.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I thought when I started these that the pieces already in place would make it too simple, but they are fun and very different. Very Mosaic Jigsaw. The sounds  the different media make as their pieces move adds a lot to the experience.<br /> Also, I originally thought that the puzzles in stone, paper, etc were the same. they aren't and are very well designed for each medium.<br />More than addictive. I will have to do them all over again when I finish, but considering how many total puzzles there are, this will not be a hardship.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Easily one of the best -- actually it's probably the best romance book to have ever existed. Do your self a favor and buy it. Right. Now.
0345495004|1.0|Don't waste your time with this one. The novel peaks early a third of the way through and then just drags on without a real point. I couldn't even bring myself to finish reading it. I thought it would be really interesting since Frank Lloyd Wright was such a 'ladies man'. It's well known that the Folks in Spring Green (only about 2 hours from where I live) did not care for Wright & his ways or his women, but especially his debt-leaving ways. I've been through the current Taliesen & you see shoddy work. Yes, Wright brought forth a whole new era in architecture, but he left alot of broken people and pocketbooks along the way. This novel almost tries to excuse that because of his brilliance. Remember this is a NOVEL, a romanticized ideal, not fact.
0312427999|5.0|This book really makes you take a hard look at the agenda driven politics in this country. Well worth the price.
B00A6X6V4K|5.0|girl of all time. All her songs are upbeat and infectious. Her voice is amazing. She's a sweet, wonderful person. What else can you ask for? Buy this. Lots of great songs on it that will keep your ears humming all day.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is great story. It is an easy read......for those of us who love flowers and their meaning.
B0086213XW|4.0|I had not heard of this movie, but overall it was good. It was a bit depressing and I am not a Michelle Williams fan.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A beautifully told tale of a mythical age. I look forward to reading the next one with eager anticipation. Book Two awaits.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Very funny. I am a big fan of this show and I am glad I can purchase these from Amazon and watch on my unbox. Love that Unbox !!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very easy read. The storyline was interesting and you wanted to keep reading. My first purchase on the kindle- it was very easy to use.
B000LX00RY|5.0|I am a big fan of this show and I am glad I can purchase these from Amazon and watch on my unbox. Love that Unbox !!!!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I've been listening to these guys for more than forty years and must say that this is one of their better efforts.  ZZ  Top records always sound like ZZ Top but some seem to &#34;have it&#34; and some don't.  This album feels more like it &#34;has it&#34; than not, both in the songwriting and performance departments.  Besides, it has been so long since there has been new ZZT anybody who basically likes this band will like this in a big way.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I really like the game. Many different types. The mini games can be a challenge because most do not tell you what to do.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Guess I am too old to appreciate this book!! If one enjoys reading about dominance/ submission and someone just having sex all the time then this book is for you!  Might give some men some instruction on how to have more exciting sex.  Otherwise, a waste of my time.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is fun to play and there is a huge variety of different games.  Grandkids love it!  I enjoy it also.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so much fun! I really suggest getting this app cause you can do ANYTHING you want! The only downside is that your world's are not unlimited cause I have played MINECRAFT for PC and there is a HUGE difference! But the best part is that it requires no internet at all for single player and multiplayer! I SUGGEST GETTING THIS FREAKEN AWESOME APP!
B0091REZMW|1.0|I tried this for a week and I am going to delete it.  I just don't care for it.  ooo
030758836X|5.0|Great read and I passed it on to my daughter to read.<br />It was an intriquing trip back and forth.  Couldn't wait to get to the end to find out if he killed her or not.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I like the regular angry birds better than the space one.  At least you know where you are aiming the birds.
0307592731|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time.  What a journey Cheryl took me on.<br />I am a hiker so really appreciated what she did.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I downloaded this but have decided to delete it.  Just not interested in having to take up time of others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am not a huge horse fan but absolutley love this game! Would definatley reccomend to horse lover's or anyone!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like this game.  It is fun to do and to see how fast you can complete it.  ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
B000001FBR|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that this casette is an original &#34;Casablanca Records&#34; tape (dated from 1977)<br />I honestly think someone bought this tape in the seventies and maybe played it once or twice and put it away!<br />Even the little dust pad inside the casette is still white proving the tape was only played once or twice from new.<br />I got my moneys worth and then some. Rock On!
B0064T6LV8|2.0|This game is ok.  ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oooo ooo oo
B0088UG8AU|5.0|Finally got around to reading this classic. Enjoyed it very much.  The movie studio did a great<br />job in casting Gregory Peck.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Chose it as it would work with my Nikon D5100 camera and its ability for bounce lighting indoors.  Nice small design that will ont overwhelm the camera.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A supremely acted, well-written and produced show that appeals to one's intelligence, with a good serving of drama and intrigue.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it!  Def did not predict how this was going to play out.  Could not put it down. The only negative is it starts out a little slow but dont give up
B003FSTN52|5.0|Love this show and will be ordering the second and third Season.  What more can I say.  I will enjoy this, as will my daughters.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Worked great at first. But then when I left it and came back it won't start . Have to unenstall.<br />Shame.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|I saw this movie at the theaters and already had a copy. I wanted the two disc edition, because of updated sigments on DVD
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I read it years ago, and decided to re-read before seeing the film. Second time was better! It is an absorbing story with a powerful message, and a great book to discuss. Chapter 21 is the crux. Loved the insights into animal behaviour, religious philosophy, and the weird and humorous elements like the meerkats and the Japanese interviewers. Can't see anybody not enjoying this book.
B00003CXAE|5.0|His this movie on VHS. Had to get rid of VHS player. Wanted a copy on DVD. A very fun movie.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was an exciting and interesting book but very typical. Good love story to work on a marriage. I felt like I knew what was going to happen.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|i like this movie, Had a copy on VHS. Had to get rid of VHS player. Wanted a DVD copy.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|So easy!  The searchbar usually brings up more than just what I was looking for, but that's a good thing!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have watched the mini series and loved it. The book is so much better it  goes into more detail of what each main character is thinking. Loved it so much I didn't want to stop reading.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|This is definitely my favorite album of 2012. Every time I listen to it I hear a new favorite track.
B000WCDBKM|3.0|It was a good movie up until they just decided to end it.  I was left wondering what happened and was that really the ending?  If they had an alternative ending, they should have used it because this ending made no sense.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I was so excited to be able to watch the one episode I missed!  Season 3 didn't let me down!  Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on TV!
B009VB97EY|3.0|I'm glad I rented it because of all the hullabaloo I had heard about it.  There was no plot just guys stripping and having simulated sex on stage.  It was one long bachelorette party.  Yawn.
0312427999|5.0|Please use the comments to demonstrate your own ignorance, unfamiliarity with empirical data, ability to repeat discredited memes, and lack of respect for scientific knowledge. Also, be sure to create straw men and argue against things she neither said nor even implied. Any irrelevancies you can mention will also be appreciated. Lastly, kindly forgo all civility in your discourse . . . you are, after all, anonymous...<br /><br />I have been noticing a trend in Amazon reviews, and those for this brilliant volume are a perfect example.<br /><br />I like to read the one star reviews for most books AFTER, I've read them, so I can make even more sense of an issue, and the public's discourse.<br /><br />From my reading, Ms Klein does NOT attack capitalism generally, nor private enterprise, but rather the religious zealots of a particular ideological stripe.<br /><br />So the fallacious assertions regarding her book, actually do the best job of supporting her thesis.<br /><br />The only real appeal of Friedman's system, outside of a tiny economic elite, is it's elegance, which is why it sells so well to the semi-literate TV nation; to sell it to any one else, one is going to have to depend on falsehood, logical fallacy and a bit of cognitive disconnect.<br /><br />And that is precisely what you will find in the negative reviews of this brilliant book.<br /><br />\\"Abuse of words has been the great instrument of sophistry and chicanery, of party, faction, and division of society.\\"<br />-John Adams<br /><br />\\"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\\"<br />-John Adams<br /><br />\\"All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise, not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.\\"<br />-John Adams<br /><br />\\"I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\\"<br />-Thomas Jefferson<br /><br /> \\"Merchants have no country. The mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains.\\"<br />-Thomas Jefferson<br /><br /> It was the rise of the nation-state, and then the rise of the democratic nation-state, that finally put a stake through the heart of feudalism. Now, in a world where international banks attack vulnerable democracies with austerity plans in the name of protecting the fabulously wealthy from taxation, and industries chase all over the globe in search of the most thoroughly exploitable labour and resources, perhaps it's time to consider rebooting this system.<br /><br />\\"Leave no authority existing not responsible to the people.\\"<br />-Thomas Jefferson<br /><br /> Now, raise your hand if you voted for your WTO delegate... As I thought. The time has long passed for the false dichotomy of unfettered trade versus isolationism. While it's true, Patriotism, like religion, ideology and national security, has been used as a tool to keep armed peasants humping themselves and their gear toward the front lines on behalf of aristocracies of every description, perhaps a modicum of nationalism is precisely what we need. The road to this fresh new hell is paved with \\"good\\" intentions... (end)
1451696191|5.0|This book was very interesting and kept me wanting to read it at all times. It is a coming-of-age story about a young boy Charlie. Charlie is not the most popular kid in school and finds adjusting to high school difficult for him. He achieves this obstacle by having really good friends who help him fit in and have a group to hang out with. The structure of the book was set up good. It was letters written by Charlie to an anonymous receiver, using fake names for all of the characters so there identities remain hidden. The book overall was very powerful and you get to see into Charlie's mind throughout it. I recommend this book for all high school students. It is a very good book and I give it two thumbs up.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|My 3 year old belly laughs at these as do I.  As there is no speech in these shows, it's great for language building opportunities with your child or for just good ol' laughing great time for the whole family.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Huge Jackman is so hot and amazing in this movie.  I love the whold Wolverine storyline and can't wait for the new movie to come out!

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD and every single song on it.  Bruno Mars is a GENIUS!  I will be getting all of his other CD's as well now!
B001CISHU4|5.0|This is by far the best and most interesting Amon Amarth release for me. Amazing riffs, great songwriting, crushing heavy production (as usual) just all around awesome. As soon as the CD is over you just want to start it over again! Amon Amarth seems to be the Ac/Dc of extreme metal, constantly releasing good material, not too different from what they've released before but always quality and catchy.
B000001EHS|5.0|I absolutely love Def Leppard and have loved them since I was a teenager.  This CD is a must have for all Def Leppard fans!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|This was much more interesting than I thought it would be.  I would highly recommend the series and loved the time frame.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I got this for my niece for her Birthday and she loves it.  What an adorable movie.  Brings back alot of childhood memories for me too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG! This app is so fun! My cousin showed me this and I loved it at first sight! She said that it was fun so I said ok and I tried it and it was so fun I had to get it. It is so much better that temple run. Get it NOW!!!!

Ending up with I have to watch it on my PC and this is not optinal. How to get in contact with you???<br />Best regards<br />Ole Blichfeldt
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My five year old daughter loves this game. Needs an adult to read the instructions&hellip;but that doesn't. slow her down a bit. This is her new favorite game.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game it is amazing it's a Facebook game for your kindle or whatever you get it for defiantly suggest it
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I use it to read downloaded like recipes and patterns...fantastic buy for the small price I paid. I definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is amazing. You get get to compete with other people as well.<br /> You get to feed and name your horse.
0812973992|5.0|I received the product exactly as advertised, and in a very timely manner. Overall, I was very pleased with this purchase.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Sometimes the game stops so you can't do the actual missions all you can do is the random events. It gets boring after a little while just doing the random events so you have to start the game over again.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series of fifty shades is incredible. You dont want to put it down because it gets  better and better as  it goes on. I would  recommend this to anyone of the mature age. I'm pretty upset that it's over. I would enjoy more books to this series and possible movies to go along to such a great read!
B008EKOO46|3.0|This book is for sure entertaining, but it does not reach the jaw-dropping fascination of Jared Diamond's other books.  Quite a lot of the book reads like an intro anthropology survey.  Pick a topic (child-rearing or care of the elderly, perhaps) and then discuss what different cultures do with the topic.<br /><br />The premise of the book is that we can find things in primitive societies that we can adapt for advanced societies.  The discussion then is that some primitive practices are worth emulating and others are not.  This is a very un-surprising conclusion.<br /><br />The sections on warfare in primitive societies were fascinating.  I was also entertained by Diamond's New Guinea escapades as adventure stories.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The entire series was great. I couldn't stop reading and wish there was more. But they ended well and didn't leave me disappointed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What a fabulous set of books!  They are quick reading and soooo interesting.  I wish I had read all these books first, before I saw the series but I am glad to read them now anyway.  I am hopuing to finish the third book before the third season begins.  I love the characters, the plot and the way the author moves from one character to the next to tell each one's story.  And what a price for 4000 pages worth of great reading!!!  All in all, a tremendous value!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I am a book lover: I love to read them, but I also love the feel of a book in my hands.  I even like the smell of the paper!  However, I have back problems and commute to school, so I often have to carry many books in my backpack, which is painful for me.  I received a Kindle Fire from my husband for Christmas, and I immediately began looking for the perfect case for my Kindle.  I wanted to keep it safe from my backpack and my kids, but I also wanted it to look nice.  I knew this was the case for me the moment I saw it.  When the case arrived I knew I'd made the right decision.  Despite the practicality of owning a Kindle, I felt like a bit of a sell out.  With this case, I feel less like I'm being &#34;unfaithful&#34; to my beloved books.  It looks lovely, it feels comfortable in my hands any way I hold it, and it protects my Kindle nicely.  As other reviewers have said, the front cover does not lay flat INITIALLY, but after laying it face down when not in use, I found that this problem disappeared in a few days.  Now I can easily flip the front cover all the way around to use the hand pocket, flip the cover back around, close it, and the cover lays flat.  I've received several compliments from fellow book lovers on how nice this case looks.  The silicone backed elastic bands hold my Kindle very well.  Sometimes there is a slow &#34;creep&#34; of a band towards a corner, but I simply nudge it back before it gets too close.  The material looks high quality, and the imperfections of the gold detailing only makes it look even more authentic.  I highly recommend this product!

0756666937|4.0|My grandson loved the two lego books I got him!!  He had them on his &#34;wish list&#34;!<br />Very nice books, he should have them for his children someday.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What a lovely book!  A man who has spent most of his life trying not to be noticed walks to the nearest mailbox to post a letter to an old co-worker who is dying.  And he keeps on walking, going on an impromptu pilgrimage.<br /><br />The story is simple.  The writing is clean and clear and wonderful.  The very English Harold and his wife, the emotionally distant Maureen, are stuck in a loveless relationship, and are oh so human.  How can you not cheer for them both to find some happiness?  Queenie and David - what are their stories and what happened so many years ago?<br /><br />Simplicity, great heart, unforgettable characters, and a gentle telling of the story all add up to a terrific literary journey.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book started off with a bang.  This is book is one you can't put down.  I think I read the whole series in one week.  A must read.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So fun!  Laughed out loud :)<br />Great for a night in and fun for the family or group of friends.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I too read more books a year than I can count.  Hands down, this is on the top of my \\"A\\" list, if not the very top.  I just could not put this one down once started.  I quickly snapped up the first and second shift and anxiously await the last book, though I hope there are more books to come in this series.  Characters are very well developed, profound existential issues are raised and well thought out plots.  This series should be on the New York Times best seller list.  I understand there will be a movie make of this story.  I hope the screenplay and quality of the movie is up to the same standard as the books.
1567184855|5.0|Michael Newtons book Journey of Souls, was recommended to me from two friends who were trying to give me comfort on the loss of my daughter. I have a belief of reincarnation or a afterlife. I never knew how that would work, over and over I had goosebumps and the feeling I knew a lot of what his case studies revealed about the spiritual journey. It has given me comfort that she is well and perhaps we will meet again if even it's just for closure.<br />Thank You to Michael Newton I look forward to reading more from him<br />Sincerely Judith
B00AREIAI8|5.0|At first i didn't want to buy this, but i looked at other reviews and though what the heck its free. in the end, it was addicting and i love it!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie is not what it was hyped up to be. Not as funny as people mentioned and it was a long movie that just continued to drag on and on. Save yourself time and money and skip on this.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is probably good for ages 10-12. If your kid wants to read a book full of funny catch phrases and adventure this book is good and if you like it you can get the son of Neptune and the mark of the Athena.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Well done and timely. You get involved in a hurry. Characters are again fleshed out as real people in an unsettling world
B00992CF6W|5.0|you need this app it is way better than all of those dumb rip off this or i recomend the PC if you have $27.
B00368PSN2|5.0|watched it & liked it bought it to watch again has a good story line & all the quality's we like in a movie please dont ask me to review all the purchases I make over & over again Thank you
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The movie was wonderful. It was sweet and sad all at the same time. I would watch this movie over and over.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|Liked it so I bought it to watch again that all I have to say about it ok for now
B00973DDN2|3.0|I know Brandon likes to experiment with sound. However, after listening to this new album off and on for nearly a month, I will have to rate it at the very bottom of all The Killers works. Every song is its own style or genre of music but at the same time, it's all very, vey cliche and not becoming of this talented group of artists.  It's almost as if Mr. flowers popped in some old tapes of Springsteen and Phil Collins and made songs.  Ill look forward to the next CD.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I've enjoyed watching the original crew of the USS Enterprise for years.  I figured if there is a series of movies to upgrade from DVD than this should be one of them.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Got this for my daughter who is 11. She loved it.She even was able to bring it to school for a movie day.All the kids thought it was good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love playing this game.  It's like Temple Run, but with more layers and color.  Plus it's FREE, which makes it even better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome app!!! so fun!!! I love this app. It is very fun! I strongly suggest that you buy this app.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game never gets boring.  A fun, colorful game what makes you solves the problems of the cute creature Om Num: How do I get the candy into his mouth?  Challenging and loads of fun!
B001E45XT4|3.0|I do not like the feel of it  on my ears since its got like a cotton fabric on it and after long time of using your ear feels hot... ones you get used to them it bothers less. If you have a big head this may not be for you since they do not stretch much. Sound is good.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater with my family I couldn't stop smiling and singing.  This movie is a joy to watch and the songs are great.  It may be the best Muppet movie yet.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this app. It is so fun. I literally play with it every day. doodle god and doodle devil are my 2 favorite apps
B009O07NDY|5.0|Listening to Howard Shore's score is like coming home again.  New themes and old are a joy to listen to.  Personal favorites are Old Friends, The Adventure Begins, Over Hill and A Good Omen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. I had a hard time putting it down. Hope the movie is just as good.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book definitely rivals the movie. It's sad, beautiful and alluring all in one. It truly reminds you what it's like to be in high school and all the issues a teenager has to deal with.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush has been my favorite band for 30yrs+ and my favorite era is the prog `70's early `80's. I am also one of those \\"desert island\\" list guys that actually likes great albums as a whole listen not as random songs on shuffle. There were seven Rush albums on that list but there are now eight. CWA is a complete Rush album experience that gets better with repeated listens (7 months in). The songs are thoughtfully crafted to propel the theme of the story but stand on their own. The story also has a lot of metaphors for the three members of Rush, especially Neil. The Gtr/Bass/Drum interplay is true power trio and Alex's sound is thick on the heavy stuff and ethereal on the clean. Geddy's bass lines are melodic and up front and his singing is the best it has ever been. Neil has a lot of energy and power but still intricate. All that is great but we are really talking about a Rush concept album that has dynamics, a cinematic flow and enough odd time/drop beats carefully placed to keep you guessing. It has elements and Easter eggs that look back on prior phases of Rush. But even if you are not a hardcore Rush fan, CWA is an amazing, complete album with ebbs and flows and is incredibly produced. No track by track review but I never saw the title track and The Garden coming. Oh yeah.....CWA is great on shuffle too. DESERT ISLAND LIST!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun. it features a horse which you will care for and you get to mix the food up.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I would recommend this CD to ALL country music lovers and even to those that are not country fans.  I purchased this CD because I love the song \\"If I Dye Young\\"....love the whole thing!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|very addictive with great video don't like that I have to buy but it is really good and then you have to rate it to get the next leavels I hope.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|This was a great suspensful movie.  This was my first time using Prime to rent a movie....very easy and quick.
B003L77GGK|5.0|My favorite show!!!  Now I can watch the episodes over and over and over and over and over and over....
B00181JGI2|5.0|The Dude is the best!<br />Its just a movie that will make anyone laugh.<br />Make sure not to miss a minute
B002JVWRAO|5.0|My favorite show!!!  Now I can watch the episodes over and over and over and over and over and over....
B00A6L78TY|5.0|It is very rare that you come across a brand new band in today's age that doesn't just sound like some other rip off of some other latest trend in the industry ear rape extravaganza....  THIS, on the other hand, is NOT that kind of record!  This album is an art-form in itself.  Much like a book to unfold, there is a message in the music.  There lies within the lyrics a secret to unravel.  The freshness of the smell of this vinyl record is rivaled ONLY with the freshness of the sounds it produces!<br /><br />You can hear echoes of The Velvet Underground, The Violent Femmes, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and I even though I could hear a touch of Red Hot Chili Pepper influence, if not just for a moment.  I could go on and on about what each individual song sounded like, but why do that when you could just go listen to the full album streaming for free online.  Just google [Pitchfork Foxygen] and its the 3rd link that pops up.<br /><br />Just be forewarned, you will suddenly have a spontaneous urge to buy this album upon hearing it!<br /><br />Also:  If you buy the vinyl you are in for a treat!  Not only does it come with a free download code, but I would swear up and down that the speed of the album is just slightly faster than what I heard streaming on that website I mentioned above...
B004HW7JH4|2.0|I have experienced skipped screens at twice during the show.  It affected my understanding about the plot, had to do some guessing work.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A bit better than the previous Prendergast novels. There are several quite interesting story lines apart from the primary \\"Boys from Brazil\\" remake, but as always well written and entertaining.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner was a great read and very compelling -- I couldn't put it down. James Dashner is simply amazing! The characters were brilliant and the writing style was unique. Loved it!
B000FCKIFU|2.0|Too LONG.  The plot was slow and confusing .  One of the most boring Baldacci books I have read.  Extremely disappointed.....a waste of money.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Detailed and intense account of life in the Navy Seals and firsthand description of mission objective. A real page turner
B0071K5KWU|5.0|Tony Banks did not disappoint with his latest orchestral work. His success as a writer already speaks for itself with Genesis.  It's too bad his earlier solo work was not as commercially successful. In 'Six Pieces for Orchestra', you can hear how he has flourished as a writer of orchestral music.  One piece in particular ('Blade') keeps getting better with each listen. Such beauty and passion! This is music that will outlive this generation.  It doesn't wear out quickly like 99.99% of pop music. Highly recommended!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I loved this book as a child and just read it for the first time to my son and I hope he grows to love it as much as I did!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|First off Game of Thrones is amazing. Also It's really cool how I can watch it on my tv, computer, and iPhone with the amazon instant video. I highly recommend this service and show.
1451695195|2.0|NO!! Any dream about heaven should be about the Lord Jesus Christ and the resurrection from the dead!!! That is that amen!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Can not wait for the 3rd book!  This book is one you can not put down. I loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book<br />I can't wait for the fourth  book to come out. This this the best book ever.
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book is a real page-turner with mind-blowing sexual scenarios. With that being said, this quickly turns into old hat by the middle of book two. I'm struggling to find inspiration to finish the third book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It just gets better and better it opens up a WHOLE new meaning to war and pain and loss and it seams like your there and your at the eage of your seat to see what happens next. I give this 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Escape from Camp 14 - Very moving and revealing.  If you like non-fiction and don't demand that everything comes out roses you may like this.  I couldn't put it down.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|It was a good book I love this book make more books please love u Justin best book ever love u
0345803507|5.0|not for kids for sure...but are great reading..porn for the housewife...i recommend the entire set! and at a great price!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really loved this book, but what i especially liked is the ending. it almost made me cry and that is just embarrassing.
B004UID2LC|1.0|thought this was a no brainer app, turns out some things really are worth what you pay for them....this is worthless!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down - it's not what one would expect.  The ending was sad, but not as sad as one would think.  Thought provoking to say the least.
B003MXGNX0|1.0|used to be able to stream HD rentals and now they make you stream from other devices if you want HD. Worst idea ever.
B004ADB17Y|5.0|My 6 and 4 year old watched this movie with us and they loved it.  They keep asking us if they can watch it again.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|For someone who likes to sit down and pour myself into a book, the format of this one threw me off.  It's not written in a narrative, chapter by chapter format.  Instead it's more of a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34;.  Once I got past that I liked it.  The format actually makes it much easier to go back and re-read sections or use them for reference when you want to try one of the concepts.  I've done the workouts... loved them!  I've done the diet... worked quite well, especially in combo with the workouts.  Still lots more to try!<br />The way the author writes is hilarious and occasionally I found myself laughing out loud!  I will certainly keep this one on my virtual shelf and go back to it from time to time.
B004CEUEWE|2.0|The plot has a lot of potential but it falls apart by the end. It entertains much less than Spider Man and falls into oblivion soon after it is over. 94% on rotten tomatoes??? Maybe I don't know much about movies... you tell me. :)
B0049VZ222|5.0|This show is one of the most exciting, intense, suspenseful and well-written shows I have ever watched.  From the first episode I was hooked.  There are some mistakes, sure.  Every show has them.  But those mistakes are so easy to over look because you remain enthralled and entertained throughout the entire show.<br />The situations that occur have caused lots of debate and commentary in our house.  The characters in the show are far from perfect, they don't do everything right, which is how life really is.  Fascinating.<br />I wouldn't recommend this show to children as it is very graphic.  I'm a horror fan from way back and I'm pretty grossed out by the realism of dead bodies and killing.  But, another reason why this show is the coolest show on tv.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I wish it was longer. The puzzles are hard enough to keep your interest but not frustrating like some other puzzle games.
1881273156|4.0|I am listening to the book now, on the advice of my pastor because of difficulties I have with my mother. I am 48. I am not married. I had an observation when listening recently. I am about 1/2 of the way through the audiobook. My observation is that I do not believe that people have one love language. What I mean is this. If a woman, like the woman Dr. Chapman is talking about now in the book where I am in it has as her love language quality time, and her husband, like the husband of her in this instance, has as his love language physical touch, I do not believe this means that the woman doesn't like sex at all, and the man doesn't like quality time at all. I think, as with most things in life, there is a spectrum, a continuum. I would hate to be married to a woman who was a 0 on the continuum of physical touch, or of quality time, for example. This is not mentioned in the book. Maybe it will be mentioned later, but there is no hint of it yet, and it doesn't seem like it will be mentioned. Perhaps to a lot of people this should be obvious, but I do not think so. A lot of things are just assumed in life. This brings a lot of problems in life too. I think that it ought to be explained that people are on a continuum regarding all of these love languages, and that there could be lots more types of languages too. No disrespect to Dr. Chapman, but I don't want to limit the thought of the types of love languages to what he has come up with. Some of this has to do with how thoughts are put into words and what an individual calls a love language. Dr. Chapman does talk of different dialects, but that doesn't really get into concrete examples. That's ok, because he does mention specific things regarding the couples he talks about. But I am sure it could be elaborated upon. Because people are on a continuum regarding at least these languages, in order for people to be clear in their thinking about them and their communication about them, they ought to recognize this. Without this acknowledgement, people become two dimensional. Life is nuanced. Life is textured. This may seem obvious to people, but I am sure to some people it is not, and it should be voiced. Perhaps the term primary love language is getting at this, and I think Dr. Chapman uses this term. But this is not enough. Also, it may be noted that the only love language that is 100 on the spectrum is the love language of God to the individual. In this case, no matter what human love language a person prefers, it pales in comparison with the ultimate love language, which is God's love. People are nuanced and complex. I submit these ideas for a more comprehensive treatment of the subject.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I do love the game.....my only complaint is with the social aspects not working....and the lack of support from game loft. That is why it is 4 star instead of 5.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So nice to have The Holy Bible to read no matter where I am. Clear and easy to read on my Kindle HD!
B00001W9G0|5.0|You just can't beat this movie on a bad day (weather).  I love this movie and would recommend it for anyone who hasn't seen it or just likes a good movie
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I read this for book club.  I was sure that it would be a typical Sparks book where you know the ending within a few pages.  Yes, that was the case.  However, I spent 15 years in Oriental,NC.  I was totally in to the novel based on my knowledge of the community.  He was accurate with most of the places he brought into the book.  I could not put the book down due to that fact.  If you are a fan of NIcholas Sparks, or of Oriental, NC, you need to read this book.  And if you have never gone to Oriental, you need to take a trip there.  It is a wonderful community.

B003RRY60S|5.0|I loved this author's style of writing.  I've read many doctor who books, but none captured The Doctor and Rose's personalities so perfectly.  This felt to me like I missed an episode of the show, but found it in a book.  I cannot give enough praise for this one.  Will definitely look for others by this author.  I haven't looked yet, but I'm really hoping there are more to enjoy from Jacqueline Rayner.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Her books are always outstanding.  Like others I have read, I hate it when the books end.  Can't wait for her next book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved reading this series.  Saw the movie and knew the books would be better (I wasn't disappointed).  I kept expecting the end to be different, but wasn't unhappy with the way it did turn out.  I just hope the remaining movies can do the books some justice.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I really couldn't get into the book.  Took me a long time to read it.  Glad when I finished.  It was hard to follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie, then decided to read the book.  I was hooked and read the entire trilogy and wasn't disappointed in the least.  Even for a 'kids' series, I truly enjoyed it as an adult.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a must read!! Once I started reading it I couldnt put it down. I fell in love with the characters and can't wait until the movie comes out
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is blocked at work, so I use the mobile app to check in during the day.  It works for what it is.  Not perfect, but functional.  Can't argue since it's free.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Yeah, I know this is a 'kids' series, but I've read all the Harry Potters as well.  This was a great series.  Couldn't put it down.  Once finished, I got the final book and read it in 2 days as well.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun I like how I can play with the horse on this game.<br />And it is cool how I can see the horse compete.
B00846REIS|4.0|I did enjoy the story line.  The book is well written, with a little steam!  Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|The case alone is of a very nice quality, and has a nice feel to it. I do also like the orange color, its more of a muted orange and not as bright as the photo on my computer screen.  It was very easy to attach the kindle to the case and your ready to go... I like the elastic strap to keep the case closed, and that closing the case puts the kindle to sleep.  The hand strap is also VERY useful, I use it all of the time. The only drawback and my reason for only four stars is that this hand strap over time has actually irritated the skin on my hands. I do tend to have sensitive skin, so that may be the issue and not the strap itself.  Also, if you need to switch hands, just rotate the kindle and use the strap on the other hand, brilliant!  There are also three 'steps' (for lack of a better word) to stand the kindle on for easy viewing of movies, web surfing, etc. Very nice product!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app tells you haw much your battery percentage is and when the last time you used it and you can make the battery color your own colour tells you how much voltage it is giving off and it tells you the temperature around you u should totally get it!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I have read recently... Great story, excellent character development and beautiful writing. I highly recommend it!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is everything that I'd hoped it would be. Great singing from the actors. The best bit is that the songs are sung in the moment - as they were feeling in the roll. Excellent!
B00APUQJLO|2.0|Some situations were bizarre, which I usually find funny, but these just weren't. It seemed like Cronenberg was saying &#34;people will watch anything I put out there.&#34; I did discover that Robert Pattinson looks a lot like Quenton Tarantino, especially when getting a prostate exam.
0425252868|5.0|I recommend this book with a box of tissues due to the impeccable story of Franz Stigler & Charlie Brown.  Both authors have demonstrated there is great chivalry in the war-torn skies and answered that &#34;good men can be found on both sides of a bad war&#34;. I'm happy to hear that these men got an opportunity for their story to be told.<br /><br />I'm a first time reader in this literature of WWII, but both authors have enticed me to learn more to future readings about Veterans of Wars. Thank you! Look forward to reading more!!!
B00947N6UG|5.0|2012 was a great year for movies. But one of the great injustices at the box office this year, was the performance of Rise of the Guardians. This movie barely made over 100 million domestically and that is just sad. The trailers had me hooked from the beginning with a great concept. Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and Jack Frost all team up to take on the Boogy Man. It's basically an animated version of the Avengers, with childhood heroes instead.  And the movie worked. 2012 has been a really good year for animation, Pirates: A Band of Misfits, Brave, Hotel Transylvania, Madagascar 3, and of course Wreck it Ralph, were all very entertaining animated films this year. I believe Rise of the Guardians is up there with Wreck it Ralph as the best of the lot. Hopefully the movie catches on  on Blu Ray and DVD because this will be a Blu Ray we will watch quite frequently in our house. This is going to be a great Easter present for my 7 year old daughter.  If you like your movies without cynicism and plenty of action/adventure, give this movie a try. I hope it becomes a favorite of your family, like it has become of mine.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Enjoy playing these type of games. This one is nice because you can pick your level of play. Keep them coming.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|DVD was great.  Received product quickly.  Very happy with transaction and would highly recommend others to view this.  The actors are great!
B0025KW29U|5.0|I sing all the songs from this show on a daily basis. Having it on Blu-Ray made my day! Thank you!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This really is a good book. I'm ashamed to say I found it later in life, though I'm almost glad I didn't read it when I was younger. I'd have been inspired to be an evil genius! The treatment of the characters, that the children are really little people, the remorse the adults have controlling them, is all very real and fantastic.<br /><br />The only real problem is the ending. It's like the author ran out of paper. I don't want to spoil it, but all subplots end (vaguely), two wars end, and they make a religion, in what amounts to about 20 pages. It seemed awfully rushed. Characterizations seem to fall apart too, though this may be a choice by the author I disagree with. Overall, a great read, and I'd like to see more from the series. PS, the end has a preview of some fantasy book that seems kind of lame.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I can't say enough words about how much I love this movie! Seeing it at this deal was a great day for me!!  :)
B007M45PMU|5.0|Drawn in by the new song...Ho Hey and have really enjoyed the whole CD.....I Love discovering new music by accident!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I ordered the Marware Vibe case for the Kindle Fire I received for Christmas and I LOVE IT!  It not only looks good, but protects my Kindle.  I read all the reviews before buying and so far I cannot find anything about it I don't like.  My granddaughter plans to buy a Kindle Fire once she saves up enough money and I plan to buy her the same case.  I highly recommend it!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great graphics and good puzzles hope it stays free for the rest of game but I'm not holding my breath
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Couldn't find instructions on how to play.  Maybe I miss them, but I don't know how to play the game.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Movies came on time in a perfect condition; the cover, the DVD's, everything. I highly recommend the seller.<br />Thank you very much.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|easy to read, strikes up great conversations, includes exercises to apply to yourself, great for a women's book club as there is a separate version for men
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|Cute game but animation is too long for adults in my opinion. Little kids will love to see the mouse run after the cheese over and over again...
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book quite surprised me since I purchased it for my 14 year old son to read.  He set the Kindle down & I picked it up because of sheer boredom.  I couldn't believe how quickly I got immersed into the story.  At times I found myself holding a hand up to my mouth trying to keep my jaw from hitting the floor.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves anything to do with Zombies.  Very worth it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not just another steamy romance. It's incredibly sexual and descriptive, but the dominating/submissive relationship was different from other romance novels that I have read. I. Can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is really fun and addicting. If you are considering getting this app get it now!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband & I love this game. The more you play the more challenging it gets! This is a must have mind challenge. Thanks Pat
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Book gives good insight into the mindset of a modern day warrior. Lots of great accounts of past missions and objectives.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Another one of those challenging games. The more you play the harder it gets. You're going to like this one too. Thanks Pat
8866130885|4.0|This is the perfect size for an agenda to carry with you all the time. A little over priced but haven't found cheaper alternatives.
B009O2XY12|3.0|wish it could be played on airplane mode and away to get more energy.why do i need 6 more words when i told you the problem in my words.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Non-stop excitement plus diverse Nd interesting characters equals a quick read wanting more at the end. You can't put it down.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is great the only problem is need more ways to get diamonds then buy.i would recomend it to others.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My kids love playing this game.  I use it as a reward when they finish their homework and finish their chores.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a Great Read;  things dont always go the way people plan and not  right way everyday. Love this idea.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very addicting.  You need to be quick so you can chop the fruit before it dissappears and make sure you don't slice a bomb.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|These two are great together! I love how reserved Zac Efron is in this movie, they have both been broken but she seems to fix his while he waits for her to come to him and then he is right there for her! Trying to fix all of her problems the same way she did his. And the grandma, I love her in everything! Also while I haven't seen Taylor in anything I'm sure she will go far in the movie industry. While this and 17 Again are my favorites for Zac. My question is when did he go from High School Musical to being a man?lol
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|If you have read the books that this movie was based on you know that the \\"real\\" Jack Reacher, is 6'5, 250 lbs, blond, and tough.  All things that Tom Cruise isn't.  To be fair, that's all I'm basing my review on, but it's fairly important.  I would feel like I couldn't take this movie seriously, and from now on every time I read one of those books, I'll be picturing Tom Cruise doing whatever is going on.  Thanks Tom.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like the game and how it challenges you on different obsticles. I like the monkeys and the idea of the game.
B009HEN7LY|3.0|Usually, I like these kinds of movies, but this one was a little hard to understand the scheme of it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|No chemistry. No plot. Funny moments but overall just lame.I am pretty disappointed because the previews made it look hilarious.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this app is fairly fun, I like the option of crowning a level, it makes it a little challenging. I want more levels, I'm at 217/219, getting close, give us more levels!
B008Y6Y1RA|4.0|Great movie with great actors. Love Emma Stone!! And Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson are hilarious as her parents. Two thumbs up!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I GAVE IT 5 STARS , IT MET MY STANDARD OF WHAT I LIKE TO WATCH.NOT OVER THE TOP, CRAZY STUFF. I LIKE THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. THE ACTORS WERE ALL GREAT. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS MOVIE
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book was just ok. I was interested while reading, but it didn't really capture me in a way I had hoped it would. I didn't like how the main character often thought in a child-like manner. Maybe it was over-hyped because of the movie, but this book just didn't meet my high hopes.
034553154X|5.0|I expected this calendar to be good, but it turned out to be fantastic! I was blown away by the beauty and detail of the drawings.  I highly recommend this for anyone who's read the ASOIAF series. For fans of the TV series who haven't read the books, warning: spoilers! :)
B000NY12CI|5.0|Before I read this book I knew who Ayaan Hirsi Ali was and what she stood for. After reading this book I have nothing but the utmost respect for her. While reading this book, I forgot that we live in a big world with many different cultures than our own.<br /><br />Reading about Miss Ali's upbringing and transition from a practicing Muslim to an atheist was amazing. I really like how she went into detail about the things that happened to her whether it was good or bad. This book had me almost at tears some moments, smiling at times, and just simply astonished(positively and negatively).<br /><br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali is without a doubt, a very strong and courageous woman.  I'm sure some could argue that she's very aggressive towards Muslims, but when you read about her upbringing, you may have an idea why. That's something that the reader should determine on their own. This book was both inspiring and educational.  Bottom line, this was an excellent and well written book.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|excellent movie, heartwarming.<br />Fast delivery.<br />Looked all over to try and find in stores, found it on Amazon.  Thank  you.
B001FQMOCA|5.0|I loved this movie because I remember Johnny Cash and I admired how he was able to kick a drug addict and rebuild his life and have a successful marriage.<br /><br />Both of the stars were exceptional in this film.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Goodness I have always loved the alien movies. And the BR does not disappoint. For those of you that get wet from extra features. The ones in this are sexy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters are great, LOVE Maggie Smith!  The ability of the writers and the cast to deliver all the facets of being human makes it heart warming and endearing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really liked this book. It's been a long time since I read his books and he did not disappoint me.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Make your day watch The Big Bang Theory - all the seasons are great!  If you could use a laugh you can find it here!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Dis boook iss veary infermative hawever tha plootline ish herd too destinguish. I hily recomend iit eef yoo haf nootheeng beter two doo.
B007NUP6CM|5.0|It was so perfect.<br /><br />I love Madonna and the cd was so brand new and on perfect condition.<br /><br />I recommed.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This is a good game but its sad that it was designed only to get you to purchase packs of cash during gameplay which are expensive to enjoy it. I have been playing for two weeks and level 35 but I have yet to receive any free cash. Your energy runs out quick and after 10 minutes you have to wait another 2 hours or so to replenish. You cant do a thing without energy. Settlers get injured and you cant cure them in time or have to buy more cash. The quests are a joke and dont award you with cash just a few hundred coins that wont buy anything. You can only prospect once a day unless you use cash. If you run out of lumber or food you have to spend cash or wait hours for energy to replenish. What a rip off game. Thats why its free. Dont waste your time or money.
B00899F0G8|4.0|I still have a few left to watch but I love the series. I read most of the books and they do veer off as they always seem to do on books made into series but in a way thats good here because I have no idea what the heck is going to happen next. so if you watch this don't expect it to stay true to the books. the only one that did was the very 1st show and it was very close. I also wish they had made the girls look like they did in the books but oh well, still a good show to watch though.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I watched &#34;Brave&#34; with my three and a half year-old when she had the flu last week. It was a bit too violent for her age, even with the kooky sound effects meant to lighten the mood, and I'm fairly sure the symbolism of the bond that needed mending went straight over her head despite my explanation. The characters are appealing and the animation top notch. &#34;Brave&#34; is no &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; and certainly doesn't have the adult appeal of &#34;Aladdin,&#34; but I liked seeing a girl making her own decisions and an adolescent struggling to balance her desire for independence against responsibility to her family and community.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game! I play this on my tablet and love to play it for long periods.Hope others enjoy it. Great Game!
B008F9E306|5.0|This album was amazing from start to finish. I did not skip one track on this album. From the beats to the other features artist this album definitely delivered.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book, I could not put it down and can't wait to see the movie in a few weeks!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a fun game but it goes slow n ur not doing as much as u can in other games when it comes to ur horse.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very intriguing, started off slow but picked up and I couldn't put it down. Gillian Flynn has a way to write twisted and dark stories!
B005UWGRIC|5.0|I love live musical performances more than anything in the world.  I have seen 100s of them in my lifetime, (Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Elton John, Rod Stewart to only name a few), but I honestly have never seen a show to top this one.  I would have given anything to have been able to see it live.  I was not a big fan of Take That or Robbie Williams in the 90's, because living in the US, I didn't know that much about them.  However, I discovered Robbie Williams a few years back and in doing a little research on him, found that I absolutely LOVE him and Take That.  I am now a massive fan and a fan for life.  Bucket List = See Robbie Williams and Take That perform live.  Progress Live - BEST CONCERT EVER!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I have played a lot of adventure games and never written a review. This one deserves one. It is well put together. The maps are helpful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love the way this product monitors and allows me to know exactly how much reserve power my Kindle Fire has. I listen to audio books and there is nothing worse than listening to a good chapter when the power goes out.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Okay, so where do I begin? I saw the movie then decided to go for the books. So far, I've read the first, Killing Floor, and this one. Killing Floor was great- I gave it 5 stars. This one is different.<br /><br />First off, it hardly feels like a Reacher novel. It takes about 3/4 of the way through the book for Reacher to do..well, anything. The rest of the book is very boring in regards to his character. No Reacher deduction skills like we saw him use on Finlay in Killing Floor. No deep thought process. Nothing that says \\"that's Jack Reacher for you.\\" I say that Child could have written this book as NOT a Jack Reacher novel, and no one would have noticed. It's not true, of course, though.<br /><br />Reacher has a bit of a background. They talk about his sniping abilities and stuff like that. It takes a while for this to build up, like I said, and a lot of time he is just a character. But, like I also said, there is no deep thought process or deduction. He is just a big strong guy and basically the first 3/4 of the novel the most he does is break out of handcuffs or break a chair. Lame.<br /><br />What's going on during this part of the novel? Well, too much. Reacher is stuck in a trunk of a van and heading across country. A cool idea, I admit, but boring in execution. Mix it into the fact that Reacher is hardly being Reacher, and you're intrigued, but bored. Child is building suspense here, between a room being built by a shady employer, a few FBI agents, the girl who Reacher is captured with's father, and occasionally these guys split up or get together or whatever. It switches between these characters so fast that I never can get a sense of setting or character development. Paragraph here, paragraph there. Was I supposed to care about these characters?<br /><br />Not spoiling too much here, but the plotline is very stupid. Not necessarily boring throughout, but stupid. The \\"evil plot\\" that you are listening to the enemies develop sounds like something that a six-year-old comes up with while playing with his friends and some toy guns. Seriously, I could never get into it at all. Not to mention the plot holes, such as Reacher's ability to know some things which he hasn't been told. Not a big deal, but weird. There are also a few chapters where Child feels like introducing politics into the book, which in the end has no real effect on anything and just makes the book longer.<br /><br />And again, not spoiling anything here, but there is a mole. The concept of a mole is someone who is working for one team but actually providing intel to the other team. Okay. I get that this is a 1999 novel, before the last decade of TV where I have seen this endlessly, but still I'm tired of the concept. Most importantly, when the mole is revealed, I didn't care. I didn't care to find out who it was, either, because the characters just were not there. They were names and there were too many of them. Killing Floor was different. I can name all of those character still and picture them. In Die Trying, I just can't care about any of them or sometimes even remember who the hell this useless person is.<br /><br />As for writing style, I do like Lee Child's. I'm now used to his short sentences (although they appear to have been lengthened more in this novel than Killing Floor, if at least a little bit). I'm also used to his description of ammo and guns. I'm not enjoying his over-thought-out ideas, though. I mean he presents a character with a problem. Then he goes into detail about how the character CAN'T do one thing, and CAN'T do another thing. Then finally says the character couldn't think of an answer. Talk about a waste of pages. About 50 pages from the end, a character is running in the woods. He takes about two pages to describe how he jumps over one log or how the ground is soggy. Waste of time.<br /><br />Then there are the things that are just stupid (besides the central plot). Reacher asks someone to go into a building and grab him a Barrett sniper rifle. He says \\"make it quick.\\" Then the guy comes back with the gun, and Reacher says he wants one with a certain serial number because he knows it works well. Okay, Reacher. You told him to be quick and neglected to tell him you needed a certain one. Reacher is supposedly incredibly smart, that is not.<br />There's also a big \\"twist\\" or whatever you want to call it when they talk about who Holly (the kidnapped girl) is. Big Twist: she's a goddaughter of the president! {NOTE: Not really a spoiler, I read it in several summaries before I read the book.} Big twist, right?<br /><br />So, generally, I did not like this book. But I do fall victim to Child's storytelling and find myself continuing on even when something stupid happens. I like Reacher as a character and the end was good because it brought that character back. No more faceless Reacher of most of the book. I also am looking forward to later novels in the series, because I hear they improve as you go along. I'm going to stick with the series, and even though I didn't like this one as much as I did the first, I didn't hate it, despite many complaints.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good story but slow thought provoking ending. I was not expecting that finish. Amy should be in jail. The end.
0786948523|5.0|I just started a Dungeons and Dragon club at my library and this has been the perfect guide for me to help teens understand how monsters work in this role-playing game. I can't compare it to other editions, since I'm new at this myself, but our dungeonmaster likes the more vivid nature of the pictures and how the information is displayed. Based off of feedback, I would recommend this to D&D players interested in acquiring the latest version of this game.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It's a challenge and fun to play.  It take a little stratagy to bounce it off the sides and so on.  I like playing it but a little more action would be nice.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Some cheese - but engaging dialogue. Much is Biblically inaccurate, but who cares: fun to watch & contemplate nonetheless. Great muscle cars too!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is fun to play and a challenge.  The only problem I have about this game is what's on the squares.  I wish they were something different.  The patterns are kinda dumb.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I looooooove this game you should get it I love it soooooo much get it you should get it nothing is bad about it as I said.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horses are realistic and it is fun to mix the food and take care of the horse. I don't like to wait for energy though.
141659521X|5.0|I like this writers style abd have purchsed most of the Mitch Rap series on line. Good books at a great price.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks of being a wallflower is the best book I ever read I say there should be a tenth star it's weird and wonderful at the same time it tackles the bullying and pressure of high school students life it's the best I've ever read of my life
0765348276|4.0|Overall, I liked the book. The writing a little on the basic side and I was a getting a little bored between 1/2 to 3/4 of the way of the way through the book, but then toward the end, it really got good. That last part really made the book for me. It ended in a way that was satisfying, not feeling like a sequel was necessary, but left open the possibility for more.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|AMAZING yet suspenseful, best of Agatha Christies wonderful books. Great for ages 15+. I have to type 7 more words so ya
B007N5YY2K|5.0|This was not the first time we watched this and each time I catch something different. The animation in really quite amazing and the story is fun and keeps you in suspense.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the first shows that my husband and I can enjoy together. The acting is wonderful and we both have our favorites.  Also, it's nice to know what everyone is talking about at parties, etc.
0812993292|5.0|I think this book would make a good selection for a discussion group! The characters and emotions are colorful. Fun reading--could hardly put the book down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I liked the tie in to the past and the strength of the characters.  That kept it from being too predictable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one on of the best Grisham books that I have read! I was getting bored with the same type of predictable book that he was producing for a while but this book is definitely different from his usual. It gets you hooked right away and keeps you in suspense. The characters are well thought out and the plot is as well!
B000H4JGZY|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of JT, nor do I buy CD's but when I heard a few of these songs on the radio I HAD to have this CD, worth every penny!
B001AXKXBW|5.0|I have all the Dream Theater CDs and this one is one of my favorites even after only a few plays. I recommend.....
B002VWNID6|5.0|I received this in a timely manner and it's in great condition. I did however find this as a boxed set (with extras) at Walmart for $3 right after I ordered this! No matter, I gave it away, after all who wouldn't want this movie? :)
B0063IH60K|1.0|It never downloaded to my tablet.  I'm glad it was free, but I don't plan on paying for any apps from Amazon.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Just right. Delivered intact and worked. Better price than at local Wal Mart. Needed to replace original cable for Kindle,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is like the best game ever!!!!! It's like taking care of my horse even when I am not at the barn!!!!!:):):):):):)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Either you like twisted gothic or you don't and if you do you're gonna love this.
B00081912E|5.0|My girlfriend loved it as a gift its her favorite movie and mine and so happy we got it on DVD now
0307887960|5.0|Excellent content.  It's a marathon, not a sprint.  I'm, losing weight steadily and realize it will be a slow but steady process.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|U like books! I like books!<br />This book made me happy, it made me sad, but also happy! Yep happy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great and I love it a lot my horses name is nikki and she is nice I love horses and now i have one
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I LOVE Ken Follett.  His best book is Pillars of the Earth, so read that before any of his others, but if you are looking for another Follett book besides Pillars, then this is a good read.  The characters are rich and the story flows really well.  It is very predictable, however.  Not surprised they made a movie out of it because it reads like a movie in some parts.  Fun and interesting read, if you like Nazis, spies and WWII though.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoyed this book and many times did not want to put it down.<br />I have always likes David Baldacci and enjoy his new lead character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my cousin has this game and i lived it so much i screemed of oy when i found out i could get it!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has become the &#34;highlight&#34; of my day-I look forward to a good cup of coffee and watching this wonderful series-it is so well written and acted that my own thoughts throughout the day now have their accent and speech patterns---
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I don't know why but as you need to keep the kindle plugged in and the app on, of course, to utilize the alarm function, my kindle fire hd heats up by morning. I tried it a couple of times and then decided I would like not to damage the kindle so will not use it again. Pehaps someone more technical can explain this to customers. . Still I gave it a 2 star as the idea is good. I just don't want to chance it.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Once you understand how to use it it's great. They give you tutorial s to help you find out how to use everything.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The ads do not bother me. But of course it is always nice not to be bothered at all for some. So as little as the app costs each can make their own decision. The free app is a great way to get started to see if you really will enjoy the game. So far I go back to it and keep trying to reach new levels of play. There is something very elemental about being able to blow things up, knock things down,and tip things over after a long frustrating day at work. Of course without really hurting anyone or anything. The birds are the hero's and the pigs wear the black hats, and the simple laughs and or geers are enough of an incentive to keep you hanging in there. Very simple game. Expect your kids to outshine you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!  It is a must do for any animal lover out there.  It is pretty realistic and as fun as it looked!  I heard about it from a friend and really wanted it.  It was not on amazon app store yet.  As soon as I found out about it, I got it.  I am not disappointed!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I like the graphics, the sound effects, and the various levels. Its sorta simular to playing poker with wild cards, yet sometimes that wild card makes you actually change your hand and you wind up with another persons hand. Its not the card game I remember that was simple and stright forward. I have to admit that this one is a lot more fun and unpredictable.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is the only show I watch and it never fails to make me laugh out loud. I love the sophisticated humor and the off-beat characters. It truly is the best comedy series ever. Love it!
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game keeps my interest only for very short periods of time. I think about ten minutes is my record of staying power. It does present challanges. Just not my kind of game. Others may find it more interesting.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|While Renner does a good job in this installment, the concept is wearing thin and story is a bit stale.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I only knew this story from what I heard on the news but her actual story was very inspirational she went through soooo much but yet she never let it define her she moved passed it
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|the synopsis of the movie was very good however there are so many unnecessary and grotesque sexual scenes. Not a movie I would expect from Matthew McConaughey. Extremely disappointed.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I love the story and the animation. Of course I'm an animal lover so that made it easy for me to really enjoy the story. It was cute.
B009LYQE2E|5.0|The item is an Amazing for One Piece Fan. It's a Limited time figure from the Film Z. The Item is amazing. Great Order , Fast Shipping and Secure Item.
B004M8S2X8|4.0|I was intrigued from the beginning and couldn't put it down til the end.<br />Good coming of age story, ending was a little over done. Overall good read!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game was excellent. I couldn't put it down..way to go guys...one of the best I have played in a while; great story line. thanks
B00APUYN0I|4.0|It was much funnier than expected, and the singing was very entertaining. There were several laugh out loud moments, overall enjoyed it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Movie was much funnier than anticipated. Though it is a lot like family guy (peter Griffin's voice etc), it was still hilarious.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like the concise, amazing amount of information on one page. The wind rose gives me the information I need living in a sometimes very windy area.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Well I honestly didn't like this book because it was quite boring and the only reason I had read it because I had to four school
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie!!! Eagerly awaiting part 2...i would deff recomend this movie.my kids love the  movie as well...lol...got this for my daughters kindle fire.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This is again one of the best works she has so far.  I am not one to listen to one CD by one artist in my music library but this is a great CD.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What began in the first chapter as interesting quickly become tiresome. Initial excitement soon wore off,  The story is in no way believable, Each chapter is a rehash of the previous one.  WHOA...OH MY...said my INNER GODDESS. I am not alone in my feelings.  I have yet to discuss this with ANYONE ( shouty capitals !) who thought the book had any merit
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I like this angry birds because you have to figure out the planet pull or the best way you should shoot. It is a fun one to play.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Easy to follow. fun challenges and nice graphics. good game for all ages to enjoy. works well on the kindle.
031606792X|5.0|This is another great book. I could not put it down. Easy to read and very enjoyable characters.<br />The movies for this book are terrible but the book is awesome
0547848412|3.0|Spoilers herein<br /><br />Now, if one was to observe the sheer number of reviews, it would seem likely this is a book which is, for the most part, polarizing in a positive way.  I was drawn to it after watching the very good film that was based on the book.  It is much easier to empathize with the character in the film, who retains some more of his puritanical essence, whilst in the book he does spiral off into the nether regions of sensory deprivation, starvation, and delirium. It becomes more of a psychological construct of someone in the throes of despair. It does indeed question the vailidity of believing in a benevolent power overseeing the details of creation... If one was to surmise from this book that there is an all-powerful being in this Universe, it would be a perhaps logical conclusion that this being is not terribly sympathetic of what was engendered. I think that it is counter-intuitive to maintain a cool narrative style in the face of one's descent into pure animal nature. Identification with the tiger and incorporating its persona may have served as a split-off lycanthropic dissociation which allowed for poor Pi to engage in carnivorous endeavors. This was what was needed, in effect, to betray the prohibitive superego from echoing too loudly in his ears... after all, the superego had physically drowned in the ocean (at least its paternal component), but remained crystalized in his inchoate psyche. As the tiger persona, all the aggressive and primitive elements of Pi can come to the forefront without fear of reproach. It is also clear that Pi fears this part of himself, and has a tremendously difficult time reconciling its existence with that of his docile human phenotype. That remains the battle. Though the parallel narrative suggests that, despite this clear split between man and beast aboard the lifeboat, in the end nature does surreptitiously take over, even without Pi's conscious awareness, as he becomes quite adept at disemboweling \\"innocent\\" animals for his own needs. People have looked at this book as a testament of human endurance and a validation that a world with God is better than one without one. This seems somewhat reductionistic and hopeful. If God is parallel to the tiger in scope, then it becomes clear that God represents a dissociated element of our psyche, one that becomes necessary to control our own anxiety-inducing schema. It becomes a being we do not understand, yet one we need and revere, one we need to keep alive (Pi admits he absolutely could not let Richard Parker die), lest we meet our own demise... Within the symbolic structure, it is a being that has the potential to destroy us as well as to sustain us, in a paradoxical and pathological balance... To quote the movie Alien, \\"the Creature is keeping him alive.\\"  Without a borrowed societal structure around us, we are forced to look into our more primeval dwellings and make sense of what lies inside. It is no surprise that RP just left without looking back after they reached land... Pi had repressed his existence his whole life, and in truth the tiger was a part of him that he could not bare to face once the firm ground of the world was once again underneath his feet. For to do that would bring about too threatening a reality, one in which aggression is unleashed, and God can be seen in all His glory.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really loved the first book in the Hunger games trilogy.  The second book I did not like and the third book I really did not like.  I loved the movie that is why I got the books but I don't think I would be interested in seeing the other two books in movies.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|this series is great to watch. i was addicted from start to finish of all the discs. this is a great series. not a documentary.
B004T340QY|5.0|Great movie. Good characters and story line. Good music. Nice pacing.  If you like the good hearted misfits on a treasure hunt meeting up with oddballs and adventures then this is for you. Great casting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just..Wow. this book was very good. It had twists that I didn't expect. I didn't want to stop reading it. My heart hurt for Sky and I hate what she had to go through. Holder is such an amazing person and I wish he was real so I could know him personally. I laughed and cried while reading this book..I'm so glad I purchased it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I don't like this version of the game, I play solitaire on another app and it is easier to use.
B0063IH60K|5.0|New to Kindle and really like this game.  Easy to play and great card movement.  Haven't had a disruptive advertisement either. Highly recommend.

B00ATSBIIG|1.0|Wouldn't download on my kindle fire.  This seems to happening a lot lately.  If Amazon can't get the compatibilities right, they need to give it up.
B004L79VUI|5.0|This is such an excellent cd. If you love Robbie's first solo cd, i can guarantee you will like this as much, if not more. I keep listening to tracks 1,3,5 & 7, then listen to the whole cd & wonder what i was thinking. It is entirely excellent, if you are a RR fan. Gotta love that smokey, silky voice and the guitar work by both Robbie and Eric will make your heart sing. Trust me.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|Cute mindless flick that certainly would resonate in some way with all of us who have ever worked and have had to deal with the frustrations of the workplace!!
B005LAII80|5.0|This was one awesome movie.  I originally saw it in the theaters and had very low expectations, came out thinking: Man I should have paid the extra to see it in 3D.  One of few movies that I just had to buy the Blu-ray version when it comes out.  A choice I heard echoed when I have played the movie to others on my big screen.  It's fun and fast Karl Urban makes an incredible Dredd, makes we wish they would make a sequel.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Movie wouldn't download  can't find an easy way to get refunded.  I'll probably use Netflix going forward.  Too bad because I like Amazon's site better.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|This is finely told horror story, set in last century's rural English countryside.  Daniel Redcliff plays a young attorney Arthur, a widower for several years after his wife dies giving birth to their first child Joseph.  His love for his wife was so strong that even time does not seem to be able to erase his memory of her.  It is as if the more time passes by, the more he misses her.  It is the young boy that keeps him going.<br /><br />Arthur's employer is loosing patience with Arthur's melancholy mood that shows so well on screen with Redcliffe's dark hair and his pale, pale skin.  It is as if young attorney's sorrow is bad for business and only if young Arthur can close sale on the house of the recently deceased client, he can resurrect his career.  So the story begins.  Arthur finds himself in a remote village where everyone seems less than thrilled to see him.  With his arrival to the village, children die mysteriously in the most gruesome deaths unbecoming of their innocent lives.  Arthur is deeply affected with the experiences since he has a child himself.  So the story turns the ghost story of horror of sort.  A deceased mother separted from her child who also died (but without a proper burial) is reliesing her vengeance.  But what striked me in this film is the way she expressed her gratitude to Arthur once Arthur reunites her with her dead son.  The end of the movie made me cry.  I was both happy and sad and I just broke down.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Many surprises in story. It is a very thought out story. It takes a lot of thinking to figure out what is going on.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Everyone must read this book!! It will change your life and allow you to live in love and not in fear. The world needs this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't want to give anything away so I will just say that this is my new favorite book!!! Must read NOW!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I believe &#34;addictive&#34; is the best word I can find to describe the 50-Shades Trilogy... You quickly find yourself racing from one chapter to another without even realizing until a couple of hours have gone by.<br /><br />Of course it's a book for women... I don't believe any men would get trapped in Christian and Anastasia's story as much as we do. It appeals to every woman's fantasies: from the classic Cinderella story that underlies in the plot to the extremely detailed descriptions that make us feel what she feels and transport it to our real lives...<br /><br />I highly recommend it, specially if you have been in a relationship for quite a long time or if you want to awaken some part of you that feels sort of numb...
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was amazing. I have not had such a good read in a long time. The story is interesting. The characters have great development and the ending was absolutely out of this world. The action packed scenes have you flipping pages faster than you can actually read. I finished this book in two days and that was during my busy season (accountant). Pick this book up, you will not be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book deals with subjects very relevant to the climate in today's schools, as evidenced by the Sandy Hook horror and other places around the world.<br /><br />Bullying, the easy availability of weapons (not just guns) and parents involvement in acknowledging their children's problems before they get to the stage of siege as in Connecticut.<br /><br />It gave our book club hours of discussion.
0760703329|5.0|It's all of Shakespeare's works. The genius of The Bard is not up for debate. This book, however, is not exactly what is pictured. The copy I got isn't as ornate or colorful. There isn't even a picture of William on the front.<br />I would have also liked if the stanzas were numbered like they are in other copies I've read. That would have helped me when I was using this at school.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I did not like this app.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to use it - and couldn't ever figure it out.  I uninstalled.
B00846REIS|1.0|Needing something to fill the void of completing  all the Fifty shade books I began to read this.<br /><br />The cover of this book should have been a warning sign of what was to come from the story line.<br />Only ten chapters in I am appalled of the similarities this book has to fifty. Perhaps not even similarities but a blatant copy of the original.<br /><br />The plot is so far fetched it ruins it completely. The reader wants to be encapsulated by a novel not put off by it's lack of realism.<br /><br />The names are distasteful and so is the way Cross tries to seduce Eva within the first week. It's totally unrealistic.<br /><br />If you ask me this book is a total knock off, perhaps written better but fails to reach the standards that fifty offered.<br /><br />Why anyone would waste their time rewriting someone else's masterpiece is beyond me.<br /><br />This author deserves no credit for this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved the book. Made me have hope and look at things differently. Can't wait to see the movie. Must read
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Will Smith is a true professional and FUNNY also. Tommy Lee.... makes me laugh with that serious face ... what a cut up!  We all really enjoyed this movie and hope there are more to  come soon.  Keep up the Good Work guys :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well written book but ZANE is a much better writer. This book honestly is for the Black Woman. If you really think this was good check out any book by author ZANE she will get you hot & steamy for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I heard a lot about minecraft from my friends at school and thought I would try it. but it was very expensive so I asked if I could try it on my kindle and my parents said yes! I have been addicted to it ever since I got it! I think the kindle is the right size to play it on because its not so big and cluncky and its not so small that its hard to control. so to sum it up: I LOVE IT!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I stayed up way past bedtime to finish. It was a bit slow to catch my interest. I almost put it down. Plot was good I enjoyed Bannister
0880796863|4.0|These are the first deck of tarot cards I have owned. So my review is as a first time buyer.<br /><br />I liked the size. It was a good size for me personally as I like the ability to see clearly all that is laid out in the cards. All the cards came with a basic description and reading so even the beginner can have a basic idea. The cards size made it a bit more than I was used to to shuffle and to use.<br /><br />The colors in the scheme seemed a bit off. There was bad contrast issues along with some bleeding and pixel issues. I think for the price the cards could have been a bit better colored IMO. I did not notice a lot of issues with the cards. For the coloring it seems a bit under standard but nothing too crazy.<br /><br />I liked the book for what it provided. The book was a brief overview of the cards and their meanings and in no way should be the only resource you have when deciphering the meanings to each card. The book was a little dry and the small print didn't make it a joy to read but it was a nice inclusion in the set as a basic reference.<br /><br />Overall I would say 3.75/5 not too bad for a beginner but I can see why someone who truly appreciates Tarot would be a bit upset. I noticed the logo on the side and then read here in the reviews about it as well. It upset me it was there, but all I have to say is at least they did not print it in the corner of the picture. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking into Tarot, especially first timers who are curious.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|People often dismiss Holy Motors as absurdist nonsense, which is in a way true, but also far from accurate. The film is many things, absurd is one of them. But mainly it is a surreal journey through the director's (Leos Carax's) life. It is his way of looking back on his life through the films he's made and the experiences he has had. It's also about the loss of his wife, which is prominent in the first scene where Carax himself wakes up in a room with an empty bed next to him. Holy Motors is also a way of looking back on the history of cinema itself through a series of stories. Holy Motors is led by Denis Lavant, who gives the best performance I have ever seen, portraying upwards of ten characters in one movie. If you're frightened that you might not like it because it's stereotyped as a weird French arthouse film then I urge you to rent this movie and judge for yourself, while it is weird, French, and close to being arthouse, it is still incredibly fun and definitely leaves you feeling like you had an experience like no other.
141659521X|5.0|My favorite Rapp book so far.Vince Flynn keeps on getting better and better. I cannot wait for the next Mitch Rapp book.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|Transition is an excellent effort from a great talent! Steve Lukather has surpassed all his previous solo efforts, and that's saying plenty. There's not a bad song in the set. I can't pick a favorite...rockers, ballads, instrumentals...kick-ass guitar work, as usual, and great vocals. \\"Creep Motel\\" & \\"Do I Stand Alone\\" have some great lyrics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it it's very fun
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story was amazing!  Great character development, good pacing, and enough nail biting to make me slightly addicted!<br /><br />Highly recommended !
B009CPJHY4|4.0|You can't go wrong with actors such as Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judy Dench and Tom Wilkinson. Quirky, funny and controversial characters stranded in a dilapidated hotel that was supposed to be grand place to retire. Their struggles to adjust to a foreign cultural and their own identities is funny and captivating to watch.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Seeing I want to start writing books for Kindle. I found this book extremely informative, and easy to understand. Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!!the graphics are so realistic and the horses are beautiful. My favorite horse is the purple unicorn!!!!BEAUTIFUL
B0094BB4TW|3.0|the app is easy to navigate but you can only see about 10 posts at a time, you're better off to use the mobile version through the browser
B004Y042N8|5.0|The Glow Puzzle app is something I came across accidentally while looking for something else. I really enjoy this app, I spend a few minutes with kt every day. I actually use it more than some of the \\"brain strengthening\\" apps I have previously downloaded.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like my OfficeSuite Professional 6 and am getting to know it's numerous features.  I am very glad that I bought it.
B001NFTZPM|4.0|Pros: The packaging is phenomenal! Its black and has Batman Ears. The movie quality is excellent.<br /><br />Con:  It had far too much violence for timid me. I have yet to watch Disc 2. But I look forward to seeing how the movie was made and the other extra features.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like my YouVersion of the Bible.  I use it for my daily quiet time and especially like the audio feature, because it helps me to learn how to pronounce difficult names.  Although, I am having trouble with it always returning to one particular chapter that I read a month ago and I don't know how to fix this annoying accurance. That particular chapter is not bookmark, so I don't know how to fix it.  Oh, well, I like all of the other features.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another great Harry Bosch novel.  I've read the entire series and love them all.  I recommend reading from the beginning.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is fun, but I warn you it can become addictive.  My four year old grandson is even hooked on it.  It is a good hand - eye co-ordination therapy for him, especially at his young age.
0786956291|1.0|This is NOT where you should start if you have never played D&D before. The box doesn't contain enough information on the game to play with others, or even get past level 1.<br /><br />I was VERY confused with this, even with the help of three other people. Eventually I had to find help from someone who had already played.<br /><br />If you are looking to start, start with someone who has been playing for a while. Try a comic book store or a library. If you must buy a book, look for the player's handbook.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I love all Disney movies..  My grandkids really love it too.  The Lion King is the best of all the movies.
B000FC0O7M|4.0|Amazed at the amount of detail Mr. Kranz put into his memoir.<br />Once I got a good handle on his writing style, I speed read through the technical explanations.<br />Nevertheless, this was a fascinating read and insight into the inner working of what was accomplished in those early days of space travel.<br />I was a teenager in 1963 and am in awe of how brave our astronauts truly were.<br />And Mr. Kranz is right up there in my mind.  Leadership, courage, quick-thinking.  A real American Hero himself.
B000FC12SM|4.0|I'm not the typical self-help book purchaser.  I purchased this book upon recomendation from a friend.  I am glad that I did, because as I read it, some things were really dead-on, though I don't think that everything in the book applies to every person.<br />Here are the things that didn't work for me:<br />Characterizations of &#34;what women hear to make them angry&#34; and &#34;what women want to hear&#34; were really off from my perspective.  When I read the parts about invalidation of feelings by a man, I did not feel that way at all and if my boyfriend were to ever read this book, I would hope that he would not change his style of answer or style of listening.  I do need to be calmed with a &#34;well the waitress is probably new, the food will get here eventually&#34; instead of feeding my fire with &#34;Yeah, the incompetence at this restaurant really gets to me too!&#34; kind of thing.  Please do not agree with me just to &#34;be on my side&#34; - sometimes &#34;my side&#34; is wrong and a little upset, and I need to be reminded that I'm a bit too warmed up - especially on the small stuff.  I do need to be offered &#34;solutions&#34;, such as &#34;if you do not like your job, then quit&#34; - for me, that sparked the idea that I should actually... &#34;quit&#34;!  I did find another, better one first.  Explanations as to why a person is late is enough to me.  With an explanation, I no longer need a long drawn out &#34;I'm very sorry, it is inconsiderate of me to be late&#34;.  How can it be inconsiderate of a man to be late if his boss kept him in a meeting?  Besides, I'm guilty of that, too -- I'd be in trouble all the time if that were the case.  So, maybe there is a little role reversal on my side for those parts of the book due to my career in a traditionally male dominated work environment.  Perhaps I've adapted to see that that style of conversation means &#34;I Care&#34;, not &#34;Your feelings don't matter&#34; - and when I talk, I am really soliciting actual advice here - and I am not commiserating, as it postulates in the book.  Otherwise, maybe I'm just telling a funny/interesting story about my day that requires no input, but is an invitation to tell about his day too - so we can both laugh.<br /><br />Here are the parts that worked for me:<br />&#34;The Cave&#34;<br />Uhh, I understand that now.  Don't poke the bear.<br /><br />Just saying thank you.  Got it.<br /><br />Appreciating.  I need to make a point to appreciate.  Nobody likes to be taken for granted.  Guilty.<br /><br />Giving more opportunity for him to do things for me, but not being needy.  Tricky, but I'm practicing.<br /><br />When he grumbles, not taking it personally.  This was very helpful.<br /><br />What repels, what attracts.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Love the Mitch Rapp character.  The story was good, but the ending left me a bit cold, wanting some kind of additional information..<br />I felt like there needed to be one more chapter at the end of the book.<br />But I still recommend it.
B0000508U6|3.0|From an average point, of view...it was alright. but could of been more positive...with more depth ! It wasn't full of the magnetism, that I was looking forward to hear.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|First of all theres something I need to get off my chest, It's been a long time since I did a review so first I wanna say I simply cannot stand and I hate the entire past living michael kiske parasite fan club who spent their entire lives trying to put down andi deris while praising michael kiske. I give a great big ****you and my middle finger to all the  michael kiske widows out there who are still today trying to say deris sucks and has no talent and This album and others is proof that the man has more talent than they ever think. Andi deris has been with helloween for over 2 decades now and theres nothing they can say or do about him. PERIOD!<br /><br />Now onto my review<br /><br />This album just blew me away, It has nice melodic power metal tunes with some modern heavy riffing and great solos with some nice wicked keyboarding for some songs and they are all outstanding. Some songs were a little repetetive when you listen to their riffing but I give em credit because it's in a very good way.<br /><br /> My Tracklist Rating would be...<br /><br />1. \\"Nabataea\\" Andi Deris 7:03 100/10 (love it! especially their stratovarious style guitar solos!)<br />2. \\"World of War\\" Sascha Gerstner 4:56 9/10<br />3. \\"Live Now!\\" Andi Deris/Sascha Gerstner 3:10 8/10<br />4. \\"Far From the Stars\\" Markus Grosskopf 4:41 10/10<br />5. \\"Burning Sun\\" Michael Weikath 5:33 10/10<br />6. \\"Waiting for the Thunder\\" Andi Deris 3:53 10/10<br />7. \\"Hold Me in Your Arms\\" Sascha Gerstner 5:10 8.5/10 (slow ballad calm song very great)<br />8. \\"Wanna Be God\\" Andi Deris 2:02 9/10 (in my opinion this should have been the first opening track)<br />9. \\"Straight Out of Hell\\" Markus Grosskopf 4:33 9/10<br />10. \\"A hole\\" Sascha Gerstner 4:09 10/10 (first time I heard andi say the F word interesting)<br />11. \\"Years\\" Michael Weikath 4:22 9/10<br />12. \\"Make Fire Catch the Fly\\" Andi Deris 4:22 10/10<br />13. \\"Church Breaks Down\\" Sascha Gerstner 6:06 8/10 (chourus's are too repetitive in this one)<br />14.  Another Shot of life 9/10<br />15.  Burning Sun ((Hammond version - dedicated to Jon Lord)) 9/10 ( same song with slight difference from the keyboards but very well done)<br /><br />Over All I give Their 14th studio album straight out of hell A 9.5 out of 10!

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|For the price, awesome game. Took one star off only because I easily completed the game in a few hours. Great story, with enough variation in gaming tasks to keep you intrigued to play until the end. Between hidden objects, mini puzzles, navigating between areas and following the story, it`s difficult to walk away before getting to the end.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|the first movie was excellet the second I`m sure will be great. batman this chapter is one of the best.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Interesting songs and rather ecclectic sound.  Saw the group on SNL which is why I downloaded the songs to hear them all.
B0073U2F2Q|5.0|very bad movie I did not like the plot and the way in which he developed the story really expect much more than a shame desecpionado pay for the disk
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I found this trilogy much deeper than I originally thought.  I experienced wide range of emotions while reading this triology from wanting to throw my Kindle across the room to crying happy, crying sad and crying angry.<br /><br />I particulary like the way the main character Ana stays true to herself while she is growing and trying to cope with many new roles and issues at once.  A huge balancing act.  And then you have Christian, who shows us that people can change and are worthy of being loved.  I enjoyed seeing him grow.<br /><br />On the surface EL James has got the 'hot-passion beginning-relationship thing' pretty well covered but reading about how well and regularly satisfied the heroine is gets a bit much.<br /><br />I particularly love the line from Christian 'God I love him but it's great when he's asleep'.<br /><br />Overall, good story, great development of characters and like all good love stories 'a happy ending'.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I loved how the movie managed to resemble the comic much excellent background music. and spectacular end to wait for the second
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I Love this show and can't get enough of it!  The Brits really know how to create quality programs and act.
B009JBZH54|5.0|excellent product of very good quality and content of valuable extras disc.<br />I recommend the purchase of this product. the book is great
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good storyline intriguing and keeps your interest. Interesting twist in the end. Totally unexpected. A must read can't wait to see the movie.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is just another busy click this to get this facebook style game. has good graphics, but u will spend hours doing the same thing over and over. prob good for a young child that really loves horses. lots of busy work to keep them busy. but berg repetitive. only 3 stars from my point of view, prov 4 or 5 stars for a horse loving child's point of view.
B00004WX4X|5.0|great condition great shipping great sound this is a must have vynil and is so kool to have hanging in your room
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is one of my favourite books and has an interesting and sad end. I would recommend this book for people who like a good book but don't go crazy when someone dies.
B003M5P9BU|5.0|love this record this record in my fovorite record ever i wish big l could be where today. dont buy this record because i want them all
B003IHW0GE|5.0|i really loved the story . the style,morals, and the unquiness of the characters and what they bring to the story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Imaginative and extremely suspenseful. loved it! Have read and read over and over again without getting bored.rest of the series is great too.
141659521X|3.0|This was not one of the author's better efforts. To be frank, the story line is a combination repeat of some of his earlier books. I will give a pass on this effort due to Vince's illness, but I am hopeful that he can bounce back with a more creative effort with his next novel.
0060005696|4.0|the author gives some great points. it seems like many options is better but too many  options backfires.  we dont really know it at the time. there are some chapters that arent important but the overall premise is great.
1594487154|4.0|The premise of this book is that, like it or not, we are all in sales either directly or in non-sales selling. Pink goes on to discuss that sales is not what it used to be because of the availability of information and that a new approach to moving others (his term for all types of sales) is needed.<br /><br />The approach encompasses three common sense qualities contained in the author's ABC's. They are as follows:<br /><br />Attunement - The capacity to take someone else's perspective and adjust your words and actions to their point of view.<br /><br />Buoyancy - the ability to staff afloat in an ocean of rejection.<br /><br />Clarity - Making sense of murky situations, to refine information instead of merely accessing it and to move from problem-solving to problem-finding.<br /><br />The abilities that are most critical in moving others are:<br /><br />Pitch - the skill of breaking down your message to its basics and doing it so that it engages another person deeply enough to begin a conversation. The author recommends using the question \\"Where are you from?\\" as the opening line as it provides a multitude of answers.<br /><br />Improvise - the skill of moving off script to adapt to unforeseen resistance and objections.<br /><br />Serve - the skill of transforming your interactions from transactions to transcendence by making them personal and purposeful.<br /><br />Pink provides lots of examples, exercises and references throughout the book along with detailed notes at the end to more fully develop each of these concepts.<br /><br />This book provides a guide on how to move others successfully in today's world in an engaging and ethical way. I strongly recommend the book for those who are looking at improving their ability to sell regardless if it is themselves, a product, an idea or an organization.
B00701897I|5.0|Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson working on a movie together, what could possibly go wrong. Its like Sherlock Holmes meets Indiana Jones, plenty of adventure and mystery to be had.
0525478817|2.0|I had high hopes for this book given the media praise and the Amazon reviews. The story line had me instantly hooked. Then came the pretentious dialogue, which would have been cloyingly obnoxious in adults. But in adolescents (I have two) it completely distracted me from an otherwise great premise. The two protagonists seemed to constantly want to one-up each other with their clever witticisms, literary allusions and world insights. It got so bad I quit reading. Really too bad given the importance of the topic and the track record of the author.
B0030LYL88|5.0|These guys really are bards. Their songs tell an epic story from beginning to end. And might I say that \\"The Birth of Evil\\" is the most upbeat sounding end of the word song ever! If you are into metal ballads or celtic faires you will definitely love this band.
1936891026|5.0|Having taken about eight years to write my first book, which is listed on Amazon.com, I was complaining to a friend about my lack of writing discipline. I have another two books in me, and had just started to write the second of a trilogy. She suggested I read The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield, as it is so well done and addresses many of my complaints. His name sounded very familiar, and it came to me that I had already read four of his books and that he is one of my favorite authors! I read this book over the holidays and was just floored by it. I felt he had written it just for me, and all those darts were hitting me right in the chest. It has helped very much to get me to the computer now, when formerly I would be so easily distracted by such inconsequential things. I am far ahead of the pace of the first book, thanks to this commonsense approach to doing what is important in your life. Thank you so much for your insight and dedication, I will make good use of it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing the movie poster at my local cinema, and I absolutely loved it! I was sucked in and didn't want to put it down. I am so anxious for the movie to come out!
B009GEOLM4|4.0|Great movie. Well worth the rental fee. If you are in anyway a fan of the excellent DC feature length cartoons, give this one a watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app ever I have always wanted a horse and a digital horse and this is the best horse game I have.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|It is The Avengers, what else is there to say. Amazing movie and Amazon VOD delivers yet another great experience.
B009P13RQY|5.0|One of the most solid bands out there. By far the best riffs I have ever heard. Even someone who knows nothing about The Sword would love this album. I think this style of metal has been greatly underappreciated. It has such a mass appeal that could pull some fans of classic or southern rock. This should be the next big thing. These guys are true musicians who aren't in it for the money. Just an overall powerhouse of an album by a band destined for greatness. I look forward to the next offering.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I was hoping this app and the cloud drive might be a suitable replacement or alternative for Dropbox -- my current method of cloud/phone/desktop picture organizer, but it is not.  Dropbox desktop app uses a lot of memory and probably the phone (Android) app does too although I haven't monitored it.  I wanted to see if the AmzCloudDrive apps are more lightweight.  They sure are, but too much so!<br /><br />Phone app issues (Android) :<br />  (1) I did not want it to upload ALL the pictures currently on my phone when I installed it.  I just want it to auto-save NEW pictures that I take with the camera.  It can't do that. It seems to be all or nothing.  So I have to manually upload each new picture taken.  The auto-upload concept is key, but if I can't turn off uploading ALL pre-existing photos, I'm not going to use it.  Is this Amazon's way to get us to use more storage - ha ha!<br /><br />  (2) to view existing Device pictures on the phone was terribly slow.  I store several large albums and it was painful to load them and slide through them.  (Here I am comparing to the speed of QuickPic app).  As an example, I have one album with about 100 pics and it took a good 30 seconds to load the thumbnail grid view.  Should take no more than 2-3 seconds.<br /><br />  (3) Need some viewing options too, like by filename, by date, etc.  Also, need a slideshow option with customizable # of seconds.<br /><br />  (4) the documentation says you can take pictures right from the app. I am not particularly interested in that, but I couldn't find such an option.<br /><br />  (5) I would have liked to create a folder in my Cloud Drive such as \\"Camera Uploads\\" and tell the app to put uploads to that location, but there was no such option.  Uploaded pics land in Pictures\my-phones-name\100MEDIA (which was automatically created).<br /><br />  (6) I did like the grid viewing of albums.  Good thumbnail size (dropbox's is too tiny to be useful).<br /><br />  (7) No de-select or select-all of pictures.  That's a must-have.<br /><br />  (8) No ability to \\"share\\" a pic to standard list of all share-able objects. The only per-picture options are delete or upload/download.<br /><br />  (9) While in the middle of viewing an album for this review, I hit my phone's back-arrow to exit the app and phone did a soft restart.  :-(<br /><br />Desktop app issues (Windows 7):<br /><br />  (1) I could not set the Download folder as desired.  I set it to  W:\AmazonCloudDrive folder, but downloads still occurred in PC's default Download location (just like any web file download).<br /><br />  (2) I expected automatic synchronization with contents of my Cloud Drive and my E:\AmazonCloudDrive,  folder, but nothing happening.  Maybe related to problem in #1 above.<br /><br />  (3) Without #2, I at least expected to right click on any jpg file in windows explorer and get a context menu item to Upload to Amazon Cloud Drive.  No such thing.<br /><br />  (4) Without #2 and #3, I'm not sure what the point is for the desktop app.  It just seems to be a few shortcuts that don't do much. I can upload files from the cloud drive website without this desktop app.  drag and drop not such a big deal, if that's the main purpose.<br /><br />Kindle Fire:  I didn't bother trying this out at this time.<br /><br />Cloud Drive:<br />  I already had the drive set up, but have not yet had much reason to use it so far.<br /><br />  Just a small comment... it would be nice if the FAVICON was a cloud icon like the one in the System Tray.  Seeing the standard Amazon favicon doesn't differentiate it from other Amazon tabs I may have open.<br /><br />Conclusion: These apps are not for me, but I can see it would be helpful for someone who is vested in Amazon Cloud Drive storage already.

B009G45M4A|5.0|This band never disappoints. Every album just grows into a heavyweight classic. This is the real deal. This is hardcore.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I thought Bruce Willis did a great job (as well as the male lead who played Bruce Willis) but I found myself looking for plot inconsistencies later in the film which is an indicator that I am losing interest in the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is amazing. The wireless delivery was carefree and spot-on! I watched all of Season 1 on Netflix, but I had to purchase Season 2 so I could get  &#34;caught up&#34; to where we are now with Season 3 being broadcast in the US. Thanks, Amazon!
B007T99ENE|5.0|Like all other McEwans' books Sweet Tooth is strictly constructed in a wonderful language. He knows how to create characters so that you are quite certain you habve already somebody like them before, and he is able to construct a plot with a tenseness and distingtiveness, so that I experience the same feeling as when I take a piece of dark chocolate. His description of London at that time is exactly as I remember it. So thank you, Ian McEwan
B009JCL58G|5.0|Listening to this music adds a new dimension to the Cloud Atlas experience (the book and movie). I am obsessed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got ky horse because my sister reccomended it, and i think it was a great defision. It's a very fun app that teaches you things you need if you want a real horse.
1932256555|1.0|I ordered this book for my son and it came with no cartridge and I can't play it in the machine.  It is not worth anything and since I'd not bought them before I didn&#34;t know what to buy.  Not very pleased with that.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave<br />This movie was very inspiring and a lesson for parents as well as children.  For parents we should not force our children to be what WE want them to be we should listen to them and give support in their decision.  Children should listen to their parents without feeling as though parents are prying into their lives.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|Fell in love with the movie and can't get enough of the action and character choices! Great for the fiction adventurer!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, especially the musical dance scenes, but no surprises. OK for younger tweens to watch.<br />Not much of a story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my nephew really love to play this game, he plays it all the time when I see him keeps him quiet
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I have always liked Return to Forever.  It has been a while since their last release.  When I found out that this CD/DVD set was coming out I was excited.  I have always been a Jean-Luc Ponty fan ever since he played with Elton John in the early 1970's.  This CD was recorded live.  I listen to it in the car, on my ipod, on my laptop and at work.  The package contains two music CD's and one DVD.  If you like &#34;Jazz Rock&#34; then this package is definitely for you.  We listen to all different genres of music at work and I usually stick to pop/rock/r&b staples.  I downloaded a couple songs from this CD to our system and everyone seems to like it.  &#34;School Days&#34; is one of my favorite songs and the version on this live CD is awesome!  Stanley Clarke can play any kind of music and he really shines here.  Great group!  Great Music! Great package!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The hook for &#34;The Kitchen House&#34; sounded great, so we chose it for our recent book club monthly pick. Parts of the book really were. In the end, however, it seemed too much like several others including &#34;The Help&#34; to be worthwhile as a unique reading choice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lovely, articulate, and profound. Great for young adults but as an adult I appreciated the nostalgia it made me feel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It has really good graphics and remains entertaining with all the I interactive activities despite the fact it has time based coin gathering and activities I am pretty happy with it
B003D5FFY0|4.0|Well, this album took me back - WAY back!<br /><br />I love a lot of the songs, but some of them seem to have been stuck in there as filler - certainly not &#34;best&#34;. Not enough to ruin the album, though. Highly Recommended!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie continues to create smiles.  Even though it is kinda old, we all watch it every Christmas.  The one liners are just too good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book warmed my heart and broke it at the same time. This book felt so real. Best book I've read in a long time.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It was one of the best Bond's ever.  I liked the action and Craig does a great job of selling Bond.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I've never been so astonished by a book. It ripped and tore at my heart like nothing before. I would recommend this book to ANYBODY. I've never written a review before so that should tell you that it's well worth it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|yes I know she's made a fortune writing these 3 books, but I had a difficult time with her limited vocabulary...now they are making a movie out of it...hope they get a good script writer.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Love Love LOVE this CD.  Christina Aguilera has such a strong, husky voice with such a fabulous range that carries a song to it's perfection.  Each and every song on this CD is simply perfect and the upbeat choices are just so darn fun to listen to.  Cher is, of course, phenomenal with her vocals...singing with such emotion.  Loved the movie too and when I heard the songs chosen for the movie...well, of course I had to have the CD.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I have had no problems with server disconnect. Fun, quick solo games. Have yet to try pvp.  Wish there was more content you could level up to instead of buy.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Really love playing this game, great amount of gameplay especially with all classes, multiple dungeon levels, and of course character levels. Micro transactions don't even break the bank.
B001VFTYWI|4.0|Cornwell at her best you finally have a chance to see inside Kay Scarpetta not just her logical and brillant mind
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I thought that the book was absolutely amazing in every way it was a little long but reading it on the KINDLE was a breeze!<br />This book definitely earned 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Fast play, challenging and great fun. Always updating the game which changes the locations so you don't get bored.
0385536828|5.0|Ian McEwan's novels (I've read 11) are usually completely involving. They feature narrative brilliance, perfectly rendered descriptions of mood and place, and sharp-edged interactions between well-drawn characters. Even so, their endings sometimes seem a trifle forced and a notch below the level of McEwan's great writing, which deftly carries an often strange story.<br /><br />Well, in SWEET TOOTH, McEwan turns this formula upside down. In this novel, the first-person narrator is 23-year old Serena Frome, a recent and undistinguished Cambridge graduate who is desperate for a relationship and whose observations can be melodramatic or sentimental. At the same time, Serena's voice doesn't quite ring true. Why this is so, I can't precisely say. But she has a pre women's-lib mindset, which seems both too passive and too fraught. There seems to be, in other words, a want of McEwan's usual precision, insight, and believability for much of SWEET TOOTH. In contrast to his other novels, this seems to show the great Ian settling for an easier and looser narrative.<br /><br />But what about the novel's conclusion? Well, I don't want to give anything away. But let it be said that any doubts this reader had about SWEET TOOTH are blown away by the clever ending, where McEwan identifies and explains the misgivings this reader had about the book. In the end, McEwan made my humble opinions both fully right and fully wrong. Makes a reader feel both sharp and humble...<br /><br />SWEET TOOTH is not a perfect book. Sometimes, I grew bored with Serena's sensibility, which is romantically manic. As a result, I took more than 10 days--forever--to finish a not-hard 300-page book. Moreover, the novel contains lots of arch criticism of literary clich&eacute;s and the literary establishment. This is all well-and-good but for the fact that the reader has to push through several mediocre short-stories, written by the character and apprentice writer Tom Haley, so that McEwan can make his literary points.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a gratifying read with a terrific ending. And I round up to five stars to show my appreciation for the excellent Ian's wonderful oeuvre.s.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a gratifying read with a terrific ending.

B000FC2KL0|3.0|although this book shows how horrible drug use can be, it also shows that anthony was REALLY lucky to have become famous and stayed alive through his drug use. i gave it a 3 because i dont want teens to think that doing crazy amount of drugs like anthony did, will turn out ok because it usually does not. anthonys story is the exception.
0439023521|5.0|read it in three days and I rarely read books. Vivid description and the movie followed the book well. A story of how central governments actually function where the citizens are held hostage by fear all to serve the politicians needs to remain in power at any cost.
1451695195|4.0|A very heartfelt experience and told through the words of someone we are groomed to trust..our doctors.If you are not a believer I don't think the telling of this experience will make you into one.But if you are as I am a true beleiver in God and what journey lies at the end of this one I think this book will solidify your trust and faith.I was a bit disappointed when I came to the end of the book and was given a website for continuing information and realized that to become a member there was a fee (which was quite pricey).<br />Some latter parts of the book got a bit technical and hard to follow.The overall writing was mostly compelling and beautifully descriptive. I finished the book and was overwhelmed as always by the glory and wonder of what is to come when our journey here comes to an end.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I always sample books before I read them, either in a bookstore or through my kindle. I didn't want to put this book down once Is tarted it. Rigg's masterfully weaves together the present and the past with a genius combination of fantasy and reality. Following Jacobs journey in discovering who his grandfather truly was was enthralling, and watching him learn about himself and what he can do. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves a solid story with an interesting array of characters that appear to be simple, but are extremely complex.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started playing this with my ( very intelligent :) 3 yr old. We are both enjoying it so far. I really like that it's interactive,  but not only can my daughter feed,  pet, &amp; groom the horse,  I can help her play the little games, training and competition. You don't HAVE to use real moola if you don't want to (but I'm sure it helps to progress further faster) but for myself &amp; my daughter this is just fine.  Oh and there's options to buy unicorns which is awesome! Overall we dig it so far :)
B00755646W|5.0|Classic Madonna! This documentary is a landmark behind the scenes inside the Queen's Blonde Ambition Tour. She set the bar then and continues to do so to this day! The picture has NEVER looked better and the SOUND is PHENOMENAL! Madonna will always be underrated to the masses but is a TRUE ICON in every way and record breaker (most successful female artist of all time). Say what you want about her (and she wants you too) the numbers and longevity speak for itself. There's only one Queen and that's Madonna!! They don't make them like that anymore!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite writers. For me, he delivers every time. Not only are his plots exciting, but he keeps me laughing throughout the book. In The Panther he does it again. His views about Yemen are incisive as well as funny. If I have any criticism at all, it's that the ending was clearly meant to string us along for the next book. But who cares?  I can't wait until the next Nelson DeMille is printed. After all, I've read The Gold Coast twice. And I'm always making sure I haven't missed any of his books.<br /><br />He's a ten in my book.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Love the easy access on my phone to check on the those bids.  Sometimes I have problems looking for how many days are left and moving back to a previous screen.  But I think that may be operator error.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Book is outstanding. Would recommend it to anyone interested in a great read.<br />Better than the movie or play, which I've seen.
B00932A6G4|1.0|I only realized this movie was rated \\"R\\" after all the GD's and SOB's and \\"what the Hell's\\" started coming out. I mean I was told that this was a \\"cartoon\\" type movie and had rented it for my 7yr. old to see. We stopped watching this after the first 10 min. I'm not a prude but I guess this was \\"my bad\\" for not realizing everything is rated \\"R\\" now a days.
B001BANK32|3.0|Definitely gets in to the heads of the characters better than the Kubrick film. Though I say they're about equally as good as each other. Worth a read.
B0093OGBL6|4.0|It was good read but a lot of info repeated too many times.  It reveals a very complicated life and proves that you can be lonely in a crowd. How sad.
B009CGKW10|1.0|Jurassic Park is a great movie - by far the best of the trilogy.  Unfortunately, there was a formatting issue with this digital movie & my Samsung LED HD TV.  The movie would play HD video only, with no audio soundtrack.  I repurchased the digital version twice but it never worked.  It played fine (both HD video & audio) on my Kindle Fire HD, however. Amazon support was very helpful in trying to solve the problem, but we were never able to make it work.

B00005JOA0|5.0|If this novel were published for the first time today, it would be hailed as a landmark: a more powerful, more feminist, and more unflinching portrayal of cruelty, love, morality, hope, and commitment than 90% of 21st century novels by women.  This film adaptation bowls me over.  Beside it, Tarantino and Scorsese are weak.  Somehow Tara Fitzgerald is able to 'grow' on screen from a blamelessly silly young woman to a bitterly experienced adult, and survives with no easy sudden solutions or evasions.  This must be her greatest role. Just one of the brief early scenes that had me rooted to my seat is when she challenges the bullying churchman, to his face, eye to eye, her voice not held back. This was 1848 for heaven's sake, and Anne Bronte had the guts to write it! The unrelenting strain between personal happiness, cruel marital suffering, and deep morality is so well directed.  Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntington is one of the most authentic psychopaths in film, and his \\"enabling\\" friends make one nauseous, because we know them today.  Supporting actors are terrific; I loved Paloma Baeza as Gilbert's witty sister, and the brutal Reverend Millward of Kenneth Cranham. For a 21st century audience it is awesome to follow Helen's committed and enduring care of her vile dying husband who is, as she insists, her husband.  Tara Fitzgerald superbly hits all the right notes, is convincing throughout, and like all great actors, says it with her face as much as with the script.  Two and a half hours; what a journey.  Unreservedly 5 stars.

B0086700CM|2.0|Well personally I love this game  I have it on my dad's phone and on the iPad ( which for some reason got.deleted) I just down loaded this on my Kindle Fire. So I was going through the instructions of how to play . When it came to the part ware you tilt to go side to side. I can't do that with my Kindle I HAVE TO DRAG THE GUY OVER INSTEAD. And each time I mean each time I Die running into the walls!! So upsetting!! Before I gave up I probably played for an H.O.U.R. if only you could just slid like your supposed to I would be happy. But, I ended up deleting it.. if you have a kindle don't buy this game.

B000ID37RM|5.0|Atticus teaches his children values & morals that many in today's world seem to have forgotten. The children are also taught to value other's lives no matter their race or social standing in life. They are also taught to think for themselves and to learn. An entertaining piece that leaves a person with something to think about.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Good plot and fun to swing and climb and jump. Fighting the bad people is cool because  you can buy combos with your XP points. Hope you like it
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie! Spoke to the heart. Judy Dench and Maggie Smith are amazing. The film inspired me, saddened me, and touched my heart.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun to play if you are looking forward to buy this than buy it now it's so fun!!!!!!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|The book is interesting.  This is my first Kindle book.  It is easy to see the words.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be more knowledgeable about the story behind the play/movie.  This is the first eBook that I downloaded on my Kindle.  I read it because I wanted a better understanding of the play/movie.  It took me about 2 years to read because of thing such as taking 3 or 4 chapters to describe the sewer system beneath the streets of Paris.  The story is amazing and I understand the play much better.  I gave the book 4 stars mostly because of the difficulty of the book to read.  I highly recommend the book for anyone who is interested in history and full story of the play/movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it is a REALLY good and funny and I really got some laughs out of this good book
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My Husband LOVES this movie and finally we watched it with some friends (who did the sing-alongs)<br /><br />It was great. The best of disney with a great feminist story of being brave and being yourself :) Brilliant for all ages.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Loved the book. Best one yet. Finished the book in three days. I will read this book several times before I get bored of it.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|The vinyl edition of the collection of the Beatles remastered versions fills a missing gap. The issue has been taken care of and I personally liked it.<br />However, it is still more of the same. The Beatles catalog is what it is and I think only fans can appreciate these developments.<br />Unfortunately the vinyl was dropped by the record and consequently stopped making turntables. The under 20 years or do not know or see it as museum pieces.<br />The book that accompanies the collection is impressive with rare photos and very elaborate.<br />In short I think the fans will be happy to have this issue.<br /><br />Deshacer cambios

B008VBYN80|4.0|My son and I both play this game. It is extremely fun and highly addicting! Although the additional items cost money.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Dredd...not a bad rent.  Having seen the cheesy Stallone version I was going to avoid this movie like the plague.  But seeing all the reviews plus being a Karl Urban fan I decided to rent it.  Wow, this is nothing like the Stallone movie except that its a judge making decisions.  Gritty, grimey, action type just better then a B movie...I loved it!<br /><br />Worth the $5 rent.  Sure it could have been better in several areas but why knock it.  I guess they didn't pay Karl enough to take off his helmet...no wry smile this time.  Dredd 2 you bet!  This is what the Stallone movie should have been.  Maybe a Stallone and Urban...nahhhh!!<br /><br />So sit back, pop some corn, and yell obscenities at the screen as Dredd gets some justice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|great writing and excellent character development. The author really channeled the voice of a 17 year old girl, which I thought was amazing
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Given as a gift. They like it a lot and especially enjoy having all of Robert Johnson's hits on two convenient discs.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What a great read!  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  The whole time I felt I was right along side of the author, step by step on her journey to finding out what she stands for.  Excellent!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|This was obtained by my my grandsons . They seem to be enjoying it very much. Nice entertainment for them and others.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I was a Star Wars fan my whole childhood. Great to see it continue with Angry Birds. Just as fun as the original, but with lightsabers!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a nice weather app. It is easy to use. It seems to be fairly accurate. I am pleased with it.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Tom Clancy is the GREATEST!  Hope he keeps writing Jack Ryan novels.  THREAT VECTOR was terrific....didn't want it to end.
B00499QUK2|5.0|So clever, great acting... Surprises around every corner, and I can't wait for the third season! Love both seasons we've seen. They are just too darn short!
B002PLALCO|5.0|Great show by a great artist! I love the short bonus clip on how to &#34;Shred the GNAR&#34;! Totally Hilarious!!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I purchased this case before being deployed to Afghanistan. I simply strapped down my xbox 360 and stuffed the accessories into the bags, closed it up and tossed it into a rucksack. During the trip overseas, this bag got tossed around, had other soldiers' gear piled on top of it (in excess of 100lbs) and was left outside for several days in freezing cold weather. Once I made it to my destination, I plugged everything in and it worked beautifully.<br />This case is durable and will protect your system. The way I set my system up, I ziptied cables and taped them to the sides so when I need to close the case up, its just a matter of unplugging the HDMI cable and the power cables. I cut a hole in one side of an accessory sleeve so I can keep my powerbrick inside the case at all times. Packing up is really simple with a few modifications.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about the case is with the tabs that secure the case shut. The holes are too small to attach any good locks, and even if you do attach locks, the tabs can be popped open easily with a knife. If the case had some type of latch with a lock, this case would be perfect.

B004SP017A|5.0|To me, the book is excellent. It's not the high water mark that The Power of Now was, but none the less, it's powerful! I love the expounding of all Religious thought and wish he would take the Christian faith further apart in light of this wisdom.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season of Downtown Abbey is just as great as the first 2. Lots of storylines moving very fast so you won't want to miss an episode. It gives a very interesting look into the \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\"  manners of the day. And the fashions are magnificent! Tv at it's finest.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love the category options in this app. Not only by style but by decade. And it streams so smoothly both on wifi and on 4G on my Galaxy3. Its a must have!

B00005JN0T|5.0|Saw this at the theater long time ago-- still a great movie! Asimov readers/fans may have a few issues with it, but otherwise, a good time!
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|The story is well written and has many twists and turns. The book made me think about life after death in a new way and expanded my previous thoughts on the subject. I understand the book will be made into a movie. I'm interested to see if Hollywood can represent the book in a decent manner.
B000ASATYO|5.0|This is one of our Families favorite &#34;Family night&#34; Movies (our kids are all over 17)<br />We used to have it on VHS- but haven't seen it in YEARS, and never had the Directors cut!  The additional scenes add cohesiveness to the storyline... and there were a few really funny one-liners cut from the origonal. I really recommend this to people who like dark, ghostly comedy!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very cool.  Perfectly functional.  No issues.  All in one alarm clock.  Even shows local weather conditions!  Very satisfied with this app.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Got this for Hubby for a late Christmas present...<br />Saw it YEARS ago at the theater- have the album and CD... also the VHS version- but no longer have a vhs player...<br />He is one happy camper!<br />NOT for kids- but a great Grown-up &#34;Party Flick&#34; for Floyd fans and fans of Adult animation!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am enjoying this game. the only down side is that it is a bit slow when loading. I love all of the cute horses.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It took a while to figure the plot line out but once you did it was very interesting to see how he was going to bring it all together
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I can't complain about the app, it's  the design of the camera in the  Kindle that drives me crazy. I mean seriously, you can't view what you are shooting...
0385737955|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was a book that can be read through in one sitting. Throughout the book, there were many questions that I had that made me read on without putting the book down. After reading the book, there seemed to be a lot of undeveloped characters. I wish the author took more time to really describe the characters more. Other than that, I really had fun reading this book and can't wait to read the Scorch Trails. I have a feeling I will be hooked onto it as much as I was with this book. I would recommend the Maze Runner to those who like to read about fictional societies that have a twist to them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is pretty amazing considering that its free. All girls will be guranteed to love this game.I hope people get on here who love horses
B009POCG2C|4.0|I liked this movie - I had read a number of reviews after purchasing it but before watching it which made me think it would be a disappointment but it was good.  My husband and I both watched from beginning to end without distraction.  Clint Eastwood still has it
B000002UZU|5.0|Some of the best electric blues sessions I've ever heard.  You just have to shake your head at how in sync Hook and the Heat are, step for step, rocking this way, jumping that, wailing along.  When JLH is moving up in a groove and hooks left, they're right there; when he hooks right, they're right there.  Alan Wilson's harmonica is *such* a factor in how things hang together, whether he's in the background, shadowing Hook, or steppin' up solo.  Be careful driving while listening to this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i was a little nervous to get this game but I am glad I did.my friends love it I love we are all very pleased
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written and acted...musical score is great also.  Will continue to watch all season now that we've caught up here.
0446677450|4.0|Definitely a god read. I would like some passive and redidual income just need the right product or company to invest in
0547564651|5.0|This book is a must-read for parents.  It will change the way you think about education and how to foster your child's success in life.  I only wish it was around before my daughter started school.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again, i could not put this book down! if you are looking for an edgy love story this is the one for you, he does go into some detail about a husband beating his wife and can be graphic as well as heartfelt at times, but still an amazing story!
B00402FGE4|5.0|I would have loved to see just what the next season could have happen. Left to glide into the empty space between galaxies and not know if the last pod was fixed or not-- bad way to end.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|This book came highly recommended by a friend, so I purchased it.  When I first started to read it, I found it odd as far as the format.  But once I got started I really liked it!  So if anyone has doubts about it at first, keep reading!!!!!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I already has the first half of season one, but buying the complete season was less expensive than getting 1.5.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We all love it. It has become a family night. Keep it up Brits! It's like the potato chips of TV...can't watch just one.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton's style of writing is beautifully descriptive...  I look forward to reading each and every one of her books!
1849163863|5.0|Well plotted;  the characters and setting are strongly drawn and authentic. The story has a brooding sense of place. Please publish and provide more of his works in paperback on this side of the Atlantic!
B009POCG2C|5.0|I just loved this movie, little did I know how hard baseball scouts work!  This is not a glamorous job.  Before I saw this movie I thought Scouting for pro baseball players was a day at the park and a night on the town.  It's a day at a hot, dusty, park with tasty yet unhealthy and limited items on the lunch or dinner menu,while trying to &#34;out scout&#34; your opponent scouts.  On the phone trying to reason with the GM or others to go after a kid . Clint Eastwood always at his finest, but was so convincing in this movie as a very skillful scout.  The scene in which a high schooler was a typical jackass demanding a bag of peanuts from a vendor, and expected the peanuts to be free because of this batter's self imposed &#34;status&#34;.  The route taken for this peaut vendor to become a walk on pitcher at this tryout  is priceless.  I don't want to spoil the plot, but rest assured this is a great film,  with stellar actors.  Don't miss it.  Take your Little Leaguers so they can see what is expected of them after their tenure during their Little League years, it's good step in the right direction and a great movie that will show them the way!
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Nothing electrical....good!  Sturdy.......better!!  A year after receiving this great truck he STILL plays with it.  Key is to make some &#34;clean&#34; garbage to go with it and maybe buy the extra pack of toters.  Sets up a Route in his play area and runs it for hours!  All hand operated is what makes it ....Best !!!
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|It would be difficult to recommend this as a &quot;free&quot; game as you can not move forward unless you unlock.  Unless you want to pay to unlock and finish the game, skip this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love this show so much. i dont usually like British shows as I cant understand the accent....But i realized after watching this, that you get used to them and good thing, because this is great!!! I love how good hearted &#34;most of them&#34; are to each other and how the owners and staff are one big family.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|This is one of the most eclectic CD's Paul Gilbert has made. I would agree with one reviewer that several of the songs have a \\"Zappaesque\\" sound and feel to them which I think must be deliberate. Some jazz standards that are handled in a straight forward way and some live covers that are excellent. The production and performances are great all the way through and Gilbert really lets the other musicians shine while still showing that he is the band leader. His wife Emi gets a lot of time and deserves it, changing styles as easily as Paul does. The other musicians get chances to take the center as well. I think the people that are disappointed in it are because they want a \\"shred\\" and mostly instrumental record, but there are plenty of people that can do that. Versatility is the key with Paul Gilbert and he really delivers it here. I will be listening to this again and again.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|really great movie its really cute and my 2 year old loves all the singing and colorful-ness (lol) . .
0946535256|5.0|I haven't played in almost 30 years and recently got a student cornet mostly to improve my lungs now that I have asthma. This book is very complete and goes from almost absolute beginner to some fairly complex material by the end. It is a fairly thick book too so there is a lot of material. The CD to play along with is excellent as well and makes it more interesting also helps your timing, rather than just tapping your foot. It even goes into complex time signature like 6/8 and covers the scales and has a fingering chart at the end. Some of the later tunes even have sections to improvise and gives you the scales you can use over the changes. It also explains chords and chord changes, which a lot of trumpet books neglect because it is not a polyphonic instrument. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004G600A4|5.0|this was a really cute movie we watch it alot since my daughter recieved it as a christmas gift this year
B0064MGU98|5.0|This season got me hooked on the show and I purchased all the other ones. It is terrific and takes you to a fun and exciting place.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|having lots of fun playing.  it can be addictive and time consuming. but if you love puzzles it is a lot of fun.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've always liked John Grisham. Some of his books are better than the others, but that's the way with most authors. This book was very interesting and I would recommend it to John Grisham fans, as well as first time readers. You will enjoy it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Keeps you guessing the whole way through!!! Another hit in this very intriguing trilogy. Can't wait to start the next one!

B007TKT2SK|5.0|What can I say, I just got the app and I haven't really used it yet it's all ready my favorite!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I just felt like I was part of the story. I forgot I was watching a movie.  Good, clean - no violence just wonderful story line with a happy ending!  All actors did a superb job!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|The tiles are so small, it is impossible to use.. A smaller surface board with fewer tiles would possibly solve this problem.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I heard this story was incredible.  I tried to read the book but had trouble with the dialect, so when I had the chance to see the movie I jumped on it.  It is the story of some very brave ladies, black and white and life as it once was in the confederate south.  The story is told with characters who appear very real and true to their time.  With dignity, humor and emotion it chronicles the lives of black maids &#34;The Help&#34; who have raised the female children of Mississippi's white families.  These children are now grown with families of their own and continue to &#34;employ&#34;, although it seems more like owning these maids.  One young woman who is not married and continues to live at home wants to become a journalist and decides to interview The Help writing a book about what it is like for them to raise the children of white families while others raise their children.  Very poignant and full of issues to bring out strong feelings, this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  There are plenty of characters to hate and many to love.  It is a very deep story with one of the best revenge plots ever!  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well written movie with a cast of wonderful actors.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|thought it was like the other movies but its a cartoon.  it was ok but it could of been better if you use real people like the other movies
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is really great! No money needed (of course you can purchase if needed) but you upgrade by the stars you collect along the way. There are quests to complete also for an extra challenge along with seeing how far you can go. Really entertaining for a great price.
0792844890|5.0|its a mel brooks movie what els is there to say.  very funny movie  u want a good laugh watch this
B008M721MS|5.0|quede sorprendo cuando pude hablar con mi esposa desde el primer momento que lo usa, es magnifico. Creo que los amantes del tablet deberian probarlo
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Didn't want to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Grisham's other novels.  Keeps you guessing
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think there are times when you all need to feel infinite. I can relate with a lot of this story line but more than that I feel that I learned about myself.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Great. The quality was awesome. I really miss this kind of movies these days. Thanks again.<br />For Matrix and For Keanu Reeves
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Was disappointed after seeing one of the trailers for it several months in advance. I thought it was going to be more than just another si fi outer space movie.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Awesome follow-up to this series. Can't wait for the last installment to see what's next for Lisbeth and savior. Especially now that they are even.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband even likes this game. He says it's great for mind strategy because you have to figure out which way to make each color path go so they don't cross each other
B009HSPODE|5.0|I have not read Alice Munro for a long time. I will now be looking at what I have been missing. The writing is fabulous. The story about the old woman going into an old folks home scary and heart breaking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 9 year old twins play this game all the time .They love trying to collect coins and then get the mystery boxes to buy new characters and accessories.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My daughter loves Barbies! She wanted a Barbie house for Christmas and so we purchased the 2 storyBeach House off Amazon. She was sooo excited when she recieved it. She does play with it often and seems to like it. Just wouldn't recommend if you have young children because there are small parts they can choke on.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I'm a mom and I even like this game! It really makes you use your brain to try to figure out where to cut the rope to get the candy to fall in his mouth. It's great for kids to help them learn angles and which way things will fall.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|This Blue-Ray version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has marvelous graphics and my son loved this ultimate edition because of all of the extras including special features.  He especially likes the deleted scenes in the extended cut.
0525953728|5.0|Well written on accounts of his life in the SEALS and Operations without giving classified information.  Nothing that wasn't already put out on local media, just a true account of what happen.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What can I say...I am not a fast reader and finished it within a week....now go read it<br />You will be glad you did.
B0042FZOFU|3.0|I ordered this as reviews stated that it was the DVD/Bluray combo pack, which IT IS NOT.  I mean, the movies are fantastic, and I'm sure the quality is great, but this set ONLY includes the Bluray.  No DVD, no digital copy.  I will be returning and ordering the combo pack.  If you look closely, there IS an option for the combo pack listed below under \\"other options and formats.\\"  Other than that, order which set you want, and enjoy.  I suppose I assumed that product reviews get linked to the appropriate products, but that does not appear to be the case here.
B000TGJ8A8|5.0|SITTING BACK VIEWING THIS MOVIE (NEXT) ON A SAMSUNG 65&#34; WITH 240MHz & 960 CMR<br />USING MONSTER CABLING W/17.8Gbps PLUS USING THE 7.1 SOUND SYSTEM (OMG)  OFF THE CHAIN<br /><br />LOVE THE MOVIE<br />MY FRIENDS ALSO
B006LSZECO|2.0|Author kept me interested enough to read thru to the end, but I was very uncomfortable while doing so. Two very sick characters. Too dysfunctional for my tastes.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My kid tore through the Wimpy Kid books and now we are working our way through the DVDs. This one was really funny. Much funnier than the original movie. This one had me laughing. There is one scene at church which was hillarious. There is not swearing or anything bad,so our four year old watched it with us. I really don't like Rodrick, but the movie is about siblings coming together to get along. I think all in all it's well cast, I love mom and dad. I think it's funny to see the kid from Jessie, a lot younger, in these movies. A really funny cute movie.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Miracle on 34th street is in color with this special edition which I am used to watching tv. This edition also comes with both blu ray an DVD. Great deal for the price.
B004O0TKWG|5.0|City to City and Night Owl are two fantastic albums by Gerry Rafferty.  These two belong together, as they were released a year apart and contain similar songs and many of the same musicians.  A real one-two punch that assured Rafferty's place among the best singer/songwriters in popular music.  The sound quality on the CD's I received is first rate.  They sound great on inexpensive computer speakers, and even better on a higher end sound system. The package arrived a day earlier than scheduled and in perfect shape.  The lack of any real booklets or album information is a negative, but for the price you simply can't beat the value. Highly recommended!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Good. Now I repeat myself so I can submit this review of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, book 5. Very very good.
B000002H38|5.0|Fabulous!!!!! if you don't have it, get it. It's timeless. In my opinion she a genius. You won't be disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thank goodness we get to have another American character, casting is top notch for the series. Ms McLane is the perfect mother in law!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Couldn't stop playing and the story line was great!  Can't wait until a sequel comes out. I will definitely purchase it.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I love the story and will continue to watch it on PBS.  The second DVD of this three piece set was so pixelated that we could not watch it.  Big disappointment.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I actually enjoyed this book. Christian's past is just so intriguing to me because it's apparently shaped the kind of person that he is. I like Ana and how she isn't completely submissive and has a mind of her own despite. Good read past all the sex scenes an  whatnot. Eager to continue the trilogy.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I Was never able to download this product. I would like to have it however there was an interruption in my service during the download. Kindly credit my account if there was a charge. Thank You
B005NFJAMG|4.0|I won't get into a summary of the plot, my opinions on the acting or a comparison to the original movie. Suffice it to say that this film is a fun and tense popcorn movie and draws you in. I only review the quality of the Blu Ray disc itself. I have the Standard Def version but bought the Blu Ray at a great bargain price so I didn't have much to lose.<br /><br />When I first inserted the Blu Ray I thought I was in trouble.  The menu was the same single picture that had been on the Standard Def version.  There are no extras of any kind on this Blu Ray other than a trailer.<br />Fortunately, the transfer to blu ray is really quite good with excellent color tones and minimal grain.  The whites of the credits had to be just below 100 IRE and they pop on the screen.  I saw no artifacting or ghosting or aliasing in any of the film.  I really did not expect the video transfer to be as good as it is for such an older movies.<br /><br />The audio defaults to DTS HD MA 5.1 and the lesserf audio compression really paid off.  It is clear as a bell with no uneven jumps up or down in volume.  The audio does make nice use of your home audio system with good and appropriate panning across the front sound stage and also from the front to the rear.  The use of discreet channels is present but not overly.  The military sound track had nice separation across the front sound stage. The audio is the star of this Blu Ray transfer.<br /><br />I have read that some scenes were cut slightly for the Blu Ray version.  I have not watched the SD version in a long time but the holder listed the film at 133 minutes. The Blu Ray also ran for the same amount of time so I did not notice any cuts at all.  This doesn't mean that they weren't done but this is the version I recall seeing in the theaters.<br /><br />Overall, for the $7.00 I paid for it, this macho popcorn movie on BluRay is well worth it.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />ThanksluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0053O89RY|5.0|Anyone who has watched Modern Family knows it is a top rated comedy. Season 3 was purchased as a gift and well received.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Totally unexpected.  Keeps you interest from beginning to end with many twists in between.<br />Would recommend for any age group.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in years but was intrigued by the subject of 11/22/63. The idea of time travel to save the life of President Kennedy was very interesting. This book was well written and kept my interest throughout.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a good Sherlock in the present interpertation and I enjoyed the season though not many are at least a hour and half long while working through a challenging case that takes a little while to figure out. the Episodes are filled with both drama and humor between John and Sherlock
B00144VBBS|5.0|I really enjoy this CD I play it all the time in my car.  It is one of the best CD's that I own
B001LM1456|5.0|I watched this mostly to know what had happened before the avengers as<br />I have watched all the other movies this Hulk movie is good one of the best and not dramatically mushy but i still do not understand why the end in the mountains was happening
B00433SVME|5.0|I find this book extremely interesting on two levels - firstly, it was written by a person almost 2000 years ago and it still reads fresh (which is mostly due to the excellent translation). I find it fascinating - even though the culture and technology have progressed so much, the essential things which make us people remained the same. Same problems, same thoughts. Secondly, the advice it gives is really good. Basically it's a philosophy of staying away from excesses and just being a good person in the foremost, and all other things will follow.<br /><br />Would recommend it to anyone in their twenties or anyone still searching about what life means to them.
0425166805|5.0|This book really has you thinking the whole time your reading. I enjoyed it so much it lead me into reading more by this author. If you like unsolved mysteries of the past then don't miss reading this book!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Don`t start this game if you have to go to work cause it`s so addictive that you`ll call in sick to stay home just to continue playing!!  Get the free Kindle version, which offers single player game style tournament or multiplayer online plays with many variarions.  Believe me ... it`s addictive!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am not a big fan of games with hidden object puzzles. But this one had just the right amount and blended well with the story. I will be looking for another G5 game soon.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|I grew up watching these guys and I really enjoyed the movie. Great action movie and it had a lot of funny parts too.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|anyone who is a fan of the tuskeege airmen and have the HBO movie as well i reccomend this movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter's were playing this all the time.  Finally found it on my Kindle.  Lots of fun - always different and challenging.  Play it every night when winding down.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Hopefully anyone who reads this book will come away with a deeper understanding of the human condition as it is now after all the changes that have taken place since the ending of slavery.  Perhaps a little more sympathy towards African-Americans who are still hurting and a little more appreciation of those  people who have been able to move way forward in spite to their race.  The book looks into the motivation, heart and soul of slave owners and slaves and the struggle and triumphs of both.  Like any good book the reader becomes engrossed inn the tale and invested in the outcome.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I downloaded on my kindle HD and it locked up, I am not techy so it was really irratating. I really liked the graphics but it would never let me stop playing.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Very easy to use! Kindle pops in with ease and it has several different standing positions. Great for reading in bed! Now I have to buy 2 more in other colors for my kids because they keep trying to take mine!
B005LAII08|3.0|I expected a movie with a very broad and sweeping cinematic scope to it. And also some fierce troll or ogre battling coming of age tale. Instead two of the main characters are piggy-backing one another throughout the whole film. They do not take a journey to a far off land to find the crystal sword that will push the protagonist to discover some profound meaning to life and become protector of her land. Instead the main scenes mostly take place in the castle and the nearby wood. Then again it is a PIXAR film which means by proxy it is a family oriented production company, so far, so I should have known what I was getting into when purchasing this film. It has it's moments...
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Timely and awesome.  I was surprised how quick this arrived and in perfect condition.  I would be sure to buy again
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The title grabbed me and I had a hard time putting it down once I started to read.  The photographs were unexpected and really added to the story.  The author did a great job marrying a teen from modern times with the past.  Highly recommended!
0800141849|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my Daughter. She saw this movie about a year ago on cable and had it recorded on her DVR. When we moved, the DVR deleted all of her recordings, and she was FURIOUS!!!! I bought this DVD as a Christmas &#34;surprise gift&#34; and she really was!!! Excellent used condition.
B0013ARLRQ|5.0|Love 7 days in June - My fav song!!! This song always makes me smile ( big cheesy) smile. I love Tullah - my all time fav Jam song!! You will end up repeating this track over and over!!  This is one of his best albums. I never get sick of this CD
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I almost paid $59 for this DVD at Best Buy!?!? But when I searched on Amazon and got it for $9 and free shipping! It was a deal I could not resist! Amazon is the best place to go and find those hard to get movies, at super low prices.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Purchased this for my husband.  I was annoyed when I got o BestBuy to purchase the new release that they make you purchase the BlueRay version with 3 movies total-all the same-one is for your computer- the reg version & the BlueRay version.  What a waste, he will never use 2 of them.  This set gives you all 3 different movies in BlueRay for $5 more than they tried to charge me for only the new release.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|This was a gift for my Daughter. I paid only a fraction of the cost of a new DVD, and received the entire set! My Daughter was so happy with this gift! She has had &#34;Karate Kid Day&#34; at least 3 times since she got them...
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was purchased for a friend and it was a big hit for a friend who is so very young @ heart...
B00002SSKI|5.0|We purchased a used copy through Amazon, as it is difficult to find this movie anywhere. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my Daughter, who screamed with delight!!! Thank you Amazon.
1451696191|3.0|First, I just want to say, what happened with this cover? I'm not sure I like it. What were the designers thinking when they made it? Now, that that has been said, I want to continue saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The melodrama of this young adult novel about angst, substance abuse, and definitely a quest for first time experiences definitely left me hanging onto every page.<br /><br />I'm not sure I like the book plot as much as I liked the style of the layout for the book. The fact that it was written in the first person made it beautifully person. And it wasn't just that it was in the first person, it had a level of fragmentation that made it organic. Life doesn't happen linearly, it happens sporadically but purposefully linked moment to moment, just how the way was written.<br /><br />The personal account was so honestly brilliant YOU WANT to keep turning the pages and find out what else Charlie thinks, experiences, or encounters. The book holds definite pains that are balanced out by hope and faith at every corner of the book. There is a quote in particular is worth documenting here in this quote because it represents exactly the final conclusion you can draw from the whole novel.<br /><br />'It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe be mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what i want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite.'<br /><br />Charlies is just one of us. His writing isn't anything sofisticated, it's simply an expression of who he is. And that's all that really counts, it's what matters. It matters we hear his voice. It's important his story gets told. His voice matters because it is a voice. Furthermore, this voice says something immensely profound.<br /><br />I felt touched by this book, and I really didn't expect it. One because it is a young adult novel geered towards a young audience who can relate. I didn't relate, and it still didn't matter. I gained enough knowledge even so. This is a quick read, and well worth your while. I would recommend it to anyone.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Ove the series, saw the first one, ehjoyed the second, this one, looking forward to the next one.  Good reading!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|In the tradition of PBS' Upstairs Downstairs great acting and great period costumes. Life in a class system that was changing in the dawn of the 20th century.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good Clancy!  Enjoyed the plot, makes you think of some of the current stuff going on in the world.  Seems to plausible!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! Way more fun than others like it. Fun for all ages/genders :) Great game especially considering it's free.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|love it! its beautiful stained glass and relaxing music makes it great before bed! no ads and nothing extra to buy! good game!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I loved the story of this movie! Judge Dredd gets locked in a mega-building; Let the Judging commence. They have a little character development with Dredd and a lot more with his recruit. You truly feel as if you are in this terrible society and really shows you how relative good/evil end up being when you change perspective. It does have some flaws, hence the 4 stars, but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Con: I don't enjoy CGI blood and guts. It ends up being far to real for me. Now, this is true to the comic since the artist would draw some nasty stuff. Drawn images are not as bad. I just don't care for it when computers make super realistic brains spill out onto concrete, people exploding, etc.<br /><br />Like I said above, the movie has some flaws. If you can just overlook some of the plot problems and the guts, than it becomes so much more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is just like it is if you had a real horse go ahead get it it is amazing
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This movie acts as a bit of a sequel to the original, but basically tells the same story. It hits on all of the same plot points the old one had and both stories (is it real or not) could potentially be taking place. I am not fond of the actors in the movie, but they even did a good job with this one. The CGI is amazing and the society created was very immersive.<br /><br />Fans of the old one might actually enjoy the new story.
B008966SIU|5.0|This album is definitely worth a listen. In my opinion this is easily one of the best records of 2012!
B005OIAFQC|5.0|Magnificent! They have outdone themselves! Some of it is a bit more mellow than I'm used to, but tracks like Nova are soul shattering in their brilliance. I don't think any other band could actually take vibrations and translate them into a musical score the way they do.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|IT A SHAME THAT ERNIST HAD TO BE A BAD GUY IN THIS MOVIE, I KNOW WITH HIS ACSENT AND LOOKS THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT THATS THE WAY IT GOES.
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this series for 20 years, and it's definitely had its high and low points.<br /><br />Even Jordan's most loyal fans, such as myself, know that he had a tendency to go on, and on, and on, about the everyday happenings of the smallest communities in the massive world he created.<br /><br />In Memory of Light, Brandon Sanderson does a valiant job of closing all of the loose ends that Jordan left, and does it in a way that's quite satisfying.<br /><br />This book is an action-filled, fast-paced (relative to the rest of the series, anyway), very satisfying piece of closure.<br /><br />Well done Brandon, well done.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|UNLIKE MOST MURDER MYSTERYS, YOU KNOW WHO DID IT PRETY FROM THE START, THE QUESTION IS HOW IS COLUMBO GOING TO CHECH THEM UP?  AND HE DOES IT IN SOME PRETY COOL WAYS.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|MACGYVER IS THE MASTER OF MAKEING IT ON THE RUN! HE PROVED YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING FROM ANYTHING, AT ANYTIME.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|COPPOLA DID A GREAT JOB POTRATING THE MOB IN THIS THREE PART MOVIE. FOLLOWING THIS ONE CHARITER THRU HIS WHOLE ADULT LIFE REALY DOESE IT.
0061351342|5.0|this is the most beautiful edition of this book that i had ever seen, its pretty and seems to be antique, the back is detailed and the sheets are little beige like an old book, its beauty.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson and I played this game before and after Christmas.  It was so much fun watching him to see him play the game and the face of 'wonderment' when the action occured to his getting the puzzle done.  And counting the days in the windows was good practice for learning.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is the cutest little app.  I like the way it shows you how to play.  Even though I play the piano already.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|...in arrogance of game developers. the graphics are beautiful the story is good and game plays fine so they justify charging money BUT IT TOO DAMN BIG. you are not going to be the only game on my device and you are not worth paying money.
B009X01C64|4.0|This is a great little case.  So many options.  Great for viewing movies.  A tough little case.  Although it is difficult getting it out of the case.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|This movie was great, if a little twisted concerning the interpersonal relationships, until the ending...really, rewind the climatic sequence and start it over again? At that point it became something on par with 'Smokin Aces'...junk...and this movie once again proved that Taylor Kitsch should have stuck to modelling!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Not enough to the story.  A lot of special effects but I was not emotionally engaged.  Was not charged by the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stop what you're doing and read this book.<br /><br />Holder is the coolest boy ever! He's the perfect mix of trouble, romantic and wait for it....(drum roll please) broken. This is NOT an easy read. It's a troubled novel but this isn't clear until well into the book. It's heartbreaking and you will cry...if you have a heart that is. It's sad and tragic but a beautiful love story...one that will captivate your heart and leave you wanting more (or a boyfriend like Holder for that matter).
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Of course the action in this film was great, but very little to the story.  I was not emotionally attached to the characters.  Sometimes Hoolywood doesn't get it.  Give us a good story and then fill it with action.  We are not hybrid droids sitting in a chair staring at your product.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I know I would need something to protect my new Kindle Fire HD, therefore I ordered this Marware Vibe Standing Case. It works Amazing and it isn't big and bulky like some cases can be.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|As I read the story ,I began to see a thinly masked commentary on our own society and its troubles. The author never let it become in your face, but it was difficult to ignore its presence. Overall it was an interesting story line that moved quite quickly.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|He writes such wonderful stories, just wish they were longer.  I hate to see them end.  Stories could have really happened.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a hard book to stop reading. The thought of time travel and potential consequences is very interesting and he does a great job of taking you back in time and also showing repercussions for minute changes.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|Would be glad to write a review. Getting worried as I haven't received it yet. Maybe someone could ck this out for me.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|WE Love this movie.  it's Not the typical princess for Disney.  cute characters and fun!  good family movie night choice!
B000002G89|3.0|I just can't warm to Clapton.  The man is obviously a great guitarist, but his music isn't interesting.  Partly it's the voice -- a workmanlike, serviceable sound, but nothing to write home about.  And the sound on this disc is good, but there seems to be such an underplaying of the virtuosity that the overall effect is bland, almost to an \\"easy listenin'\\" degree.  I liked \\"Riding with the King,\\" his album with BB King -- that had some fire to it, but this seems low-energy.  What energy there is is in \\"Motherless Children\\" and \\"mainline Florida.\\"  \\"Steady Rollin' Man\\" gestures to the blues, and \\"I Can't Hold Out\\" works well.  Otherwise I can take it or leave it -- even \\"I Shot The Sheriff,\\" which is tame compared to Bob Marley's.  What am I missing??
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great!  Can't wait to see more episodes. Instant video ordering and download process is easy and fast.  Can watch anytime.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love Jonny Lee Miller's nuanced performance. He is mesmerizing to watch.  Much less manic than Benedict Cumberbach's portrayal in Sherlock which I find totally distracting.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love this show. I refused to watch it for years and then I was stuck in a hotel room with nothing but mentalist marathons on, now I'm hooked. One of my favorite shows, watch it!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Started out well, then got too sad and dramatic.  It was written from a dog's point of view and somehow I don't see dog being such a drama queen (and this was written by a man?)  Has is good points though, guess I expected too much  having raised dog's my whole life and being a veterinarian assistant, but who knows perhaps I'm the wrong one.  I do enjoy a good dog book!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Very much enjoyed this album from the first listen. Great lyrics as usual and continues the form of the past couple of albums with a more laid back, sort of country, feel. Good album. Recommended if you like Dylan's last few albums. If you are looking for the Dylan of Tambourine Man etc, he is gone forever I suspect. Still a  must have for any Dylan fan though.
B002SR3T10|5.0|This is not only the most unusual Christmas album I have ever heard, it is also the most beautiful.  We did not purchase it until after Christmas when we were sick to death of Christmas carols, but this is very different, and even now at the end of January we are still playing it every day.
B007PVHBHC|3.0|It takes a while but it grows on you. Worth a listen, my wife hates it, but I like it, Patti is that kind of singer I guess. It's a bit mournful but the band is terrific.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app and any other horse lover would too.<br /><br />the only down fall to the app is that its hard to get coins and Jems.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Good solid album from one of the best songwriters of the age. Smooth brass as usual. Nice, comfortable listening. I like it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I don't have a lot of music.  This is free for the amount of storage I need.  Streaming over cellular broadband is almost always flawless, even when riding in the car through the country.  Probably my most used application on my Android phone (Galaxy S3 on US Cellular).
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is a great album, not good, great! The harmonies are outstanding, the lyrics thought provoking, the banjo is insane and the band are so tight. An absolute must have album for my money. I have both albums and if they bring out another soon I would buy it without trialling it they are so good.
0765325950|5.0|It has all been building to this.  There are virtually no slow parts here as there were in previous editions.  No braid-tugging or sturdy Two Rivers wool.  Hard to catch your breath at times, but I can't put it down.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This is a timeless sweet movie. The acting is great.Love it Great cast and music is good too. Love Ducky
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you are familiar with this show I absolutel recommend getting this set. This is and epic show and the quality of this set is great!
B005LAIISA|3.0|I personally think ALL the previous Ice Age movies were better than this one, ESP in the comedy area.  It was good, just not gut-busting like the others!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app if your on the go and u dont want to bring your bible or if you just didnt fit your daily reading into your hectac day! I absolutley recommend thus app!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not the typical King read.  Really got me thinking about the what ifs and the I wonders. The things you do or might do for love.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Finished up all the games in the series in less than an hour.  Have to pay to get more.  would be nice to have a scoring system.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I didn't stop playing until my trial was over. I wish I had the money to unlock the game,but I'll just need to wait.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This has to be my favorite of all the Tinkerbell movies.It is a very good family movie and my little 2 year old girl actually sat and watched it with us!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It has so many options for you to draw!  It lets you redraw your Stick man, it gives you hints, it's just drawing heaven! At the the beginning, it will have you draw your Stick man, then it will say, it's kind of lonely in here, how about you give your Stick man a friend? Then you draw your friend, and then your friend gets stolen! That is when your journey begins! At one point, you will have to fight a really big monster! Hint: draw some fire on his belly when you get close to him, he will stand up. I recommend you get this app, it is really fun and challenging. Hoped this helps!  _Reviews and Likes

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Dan's book comes at the right time for CPAs, business professionals, and just about everybody. In today's rapidly changing and increasingly complex world we all find oursleves in the \\"moving business\\". That is persuading, convincing, influencing, teaching others to adopt new ideas, innovate, and constantly improve things, or as Dan says, \\"moving people to part with resources - whether something tangible like cash or intangible like effort or attention - so that we both get what we want.\\" he even backs it up with research. Although one in ten of us are in \\"sales\\", the other nine of us spend 40% of our time or 24 minutes per hour in what he calls non-sales selling. This book is the guide to why, what and how of non-sales selling and I highly recommend this book for everyone in business today.<br /><br />He talks about the new A-B-Cs of selling as Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity and I love how he connects the latest research from the Positive Psychology Movement to non-sales selling. His book is full of resources, stories, research, and useful examples of how to apply his ideas to almost every situation (from e-mail subject lines to signage to pitches).<br /><br />In a \\"...world of flat organizations and tumultuous conditions - and that's our world\\" fixed skills will be punished and elastic and flexible skills will be prized according to Pink (and I agree). In that world of increasing change, the one common skill will be the ability to move others or to be adept at non-sales selling.<br /><br />As a CEO of a non-profit professional association (Maryland Association of CPAs), I realized that we (and I) have been in the moving business since 1901. Moving the CPA Profession and our members forward, moving the market to CPAs and their services, and moving legislative and regulatory proposals on behalf of our members by moving legislators. Today we find ourselves moving our members faster in response to changing technology, new generations and expectations, new ways of learning and particpating. We are in the moving business and this book is a wonderful resource.<br /><br />After reading this book, I think I am changing my title from CEO to CMO, Chief Movement Officer.arning and particpating.

B005M2A4DE|5.0|You're either in the target audience for this, or you're not - but this set includes things not on Netflix.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is worth eight bucks at least. Couldn't put it down, was laughing and groaning and exclaiming all the way thru. Would make a great movie.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I absolutely loved season 1 of AHS and had to buy this! Not only was it cheaper than anywhere else but it's perfect. It got here fast and it fantastic shape. Not a dent or ding on the box.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|A lame attempt to convey the complexities of the mother daughter relationship. Boring for kids and not entertaining for adults.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|My 4 year old son love this game he can get through to the next level with a small amount of effort.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I bought the album because of Drive By and 50 Ways to Say Goodbye. The rest of the CD is entirely different but I have become addicted to the whole thing. This is the first \\"album\\" I have ever bought that I don't skip a track.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Man this game is addicting!  I chose it for my 2 year old to fiddle with and I can't hardly put it down!
B001Q7JD3Q|4.0|I'm a huge effects movie fan.....love the eye candy.  I felt this was a faithful tribute to the original movie.
