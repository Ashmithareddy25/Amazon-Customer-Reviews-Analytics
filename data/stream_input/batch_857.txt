B001GKJ2E8|3.0|What I liked about the movie was that not since The Matrix have I seen bullet time used to such a great effect.  If you're a fan of bullet time then you'll like this movies use of it.  It doesnt feel like a Matrix clone or a cheap parody.  It's used as part of the plot itself, so it becomes more relevant than just a special effect. Nonstop action scenes start after a very short character delvelopment period, and I do mean nonstop. The action is fast and furious throughout every scene.  The budget on this film must have been phenomenal, or else they found some cheap CGI labor.  That's what I liked about it, what I didn't like about it is that it was poorly written.  By the time the twist in the movie is revealed, it will be obvious to the viewer what it is.  They used too much forshadowing. One event that happened was forshadowed three times, and blatantly at that.  I'd rather be kept guessing until a twist occurs, to me that's not even a twist.  The dialog was mediocre at best.  Even the stellar cast couldn't save that. All in all I liked it.  I'd recommend it as a rental for sure.  As a purchase I believe it'd be one you'd watch once and then put away in your collection.  Of course, if you are an uber fan of Jolie or Freeman, it's a must own.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|I am in no way comparing Damian Marley to Bob Marley. Bob Marley is a legend, and I dont think anyone would ever be able to do what he did or even get close to the level that he was.      Damian Marley's CD is excellent.  Great songs that really get you in the mood to dance.  There are also tracks like \\"pimpa's paradise\\" and, of course, \\"welcome to jamrock\\" which deal with very heavy issues.  All in all, wonderful CD and definitely recommend it to anyone who loves reggae/dancehall music :)
0061289809|2.0|The book itself is wonderful. However, it did not come to me in good shape. It was a hard cover and new, but the corner of it was damaged. I didn't have time to exchange it because I needed to ship it to my neice for her birthday, but I was embarassed that I had to send something in that condition. I would have hoped that there was some kind of quality control at Amazon, but apparently not too stringent in that category.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|This is a very good albumn. Megadeth is back! Dave is great with his vocal's especialy track 8. I like the political tone in these times, they have not backed off of what we as a country are doing! Megadeth is my all time favorite band! This albumn is a must have.....
0007189885|3.0|This book was well written and I enjoyed reading it.  I did not LOVE it though.  Good enough to keep me reading but not good enough to keep me up late.  Sadly, the main character's lives are realistic.
B000TGZPOQ|5.0|This by far is Megadeth's best albumn. All the songs are classic. Dave Mustaine rips on vocal's and prove Megadeth is the leader in top metal bands. In my opinion this put them over Metallica. Although they have not achieved the level of this albumn since, United Abomonations is close. If you can only buy 1 Megadeth albumn this is it! I listened to this one thousands of time on tape! I still have the tape!

Good acting on both parts.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire is a modern-ish rags-to-riches story. This epic is a combonation of action, romance, and suspense. Slumdog (I'm just going to refer to it as simply \\"Slumdog\\" is the story of Jamal, a teen from the slums of Mumbai and how he became a winning contestant of India's version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\\" . . . The movie consists of flashback after flashback that reveals Jamal's lifestory along with revealing how Jamal knew the answers to the questions asked.<br /><br />The Movie was rated R and it was rated R for a reason . . Here's why:<br />1) Language . . .There's a considerable amount of cussing<br />2) Violence . . . While at times the violence was almost distasteful, it was vital to the plot . . Boyle (the Director) took a almost political stand point in showing the corruptness the roamed the streets of India (namely Mumbai [previously known as Bombay]) . . .There were gang affairs, murderous acts, disfiguration (of a child nonetheless!), a massacre, and sexual abuse [and abuse in general] (if any of those topics bother you intensely I wouldn't see this movie, but remember it's just a movie . . It's NOT real)<br />3) Prostitution is an issue that's also covered in Slumdog<br /><br />H'okay I like Slumdog and rated it as 4 stars because:<br /><br />1) The acting was excellent . . . I never heard of any of these actors before and I think that's what makes it all the more special . . . In my opinion it makes you less biased if you don't know who the actors/actresses are because you can't automatically like a movie because it has whatshisface in or or automatically dislike the movie because whathisface is in it . . . It's weird how some people get really emotionally involved with their most/least favorite actors/actresses . .<br /><br />2)It has a message unlike all those stupid teen movies (which sometime can be entertaining but not in an artistic sense . . . I see Slumdog as a piece of art). Sure the main message is sort of corny: Love conquers all yada-yada . . .but be sure to note the other messages (some political) as well . . .<br /><br />3) The Music - I'm such a sucker for M.I.A.'s \\"Paper Planes\\" and the more traditional Indian music was good too<br /><br />Things that I didn't like Slumdog (aka why I took off a star):<br /><br />1) It ruined my image of India . . sort of .  .

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie was wonderful and funny when it was just for the internet but now that it's on DVD it's even better!  All the bonus features and hidden Easter eggs are great and add so much to the movie.  I highly recommend this to anyone!  Excellent buy!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The first 20 episodes of this 22 episode season keeps with the spirit of the first 6 seasons. However, the last 2 episodes were completely off, most specifically when Rory tells Logan she doesn't want to marry him. I mean. Come on. The season needs to end with a feel-good sense, and if Rory had said yes when Logan proposed, the series finale would have been exquisite. Only, it wasn't. In fact, I personally felt angry and bitter towards both Lorelai and Rory, especially Lorelai. I mean. She is a bit selfish in a way that she wants Rory for herself. Plus, she can't make up her mind when it comes to her own male relationships mostly because she fails to understand that love is a two-way street.   So, in other words, if you are a serious Gilmore Girls fan and don't want to spoil the essence of this series, then don't watch the last two episodes. The other 20 episodes, on the other hand, are perfectly fine to watch.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|this is the best one of my albums.    5th Gear's songs is rhythmic so that it's very good.    but, when i receive it, it was plastic cd case with crack.  (i live in overseas. i think... that's why it did.)

B000005J56|5.0|Imagine that a tropical island lies less than 100 miles from the coast of Florida.  Imagine that on this island live the Spanish equivalents of Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Berry.  Imagine that 40 years ago this island nation was taken over by a militant dictator and that these musicians were not heard outside of their island for decades.<br /><br />You don't have to imagine since it all happened.<br /><br />Besides being a great guitarist, Ry Cooder is perhaps as valuable to the world as an arranger, producer and discoverer of fertile musical ground. Invited on a trip (through Mexico) to Havana, he was amazed to discover that many of the legendary performers of the old Buena Vista Social Club were still alive and performing vibrant music.  With the weight of Mr. Cooder these Cuban All-Stars gathered for an historic six day recording session.  The velvety-voiced Ibrahim Ferrer is joined by 70-ish \\"Fiancee of Feeling\\" Omara Portuondo and fiery Compay Segundo.  The group is anchored by bass virtuoso Orlando \\"Cachaito\\" Lopez. The sound is built around the expert piano work of Ruben Gonzalez, blending his classical training with the seductive rhythms of Havana.<br /><br />Many of these brilliant musicians have passed since this 1997 recording, but as a result most were able to tour the world, bringing their musical diplomacy to Carnegie Hall, Amsterdam, Spain, France, Reykjavik...<br /><br />We are indebted to these musicians, and to Ry Cooder for finding these lost treasures.
0525950079|5.0|I never thought that another book could be as good as Pillars of the Earth, but I was wrong.  World without End comes in a close second.  The story is intriguing and holds the reader's attention page after page.  I found this book very hard to put down (just as its predecessor) and read it in record time.  Whether Mr. Follett can do it again remains to be seen, but I hope that there is a sequel.  I would love to see what happens in the next 200 years.
B000001E7L|3.0|3 1/2    Standing a certain test of time despite several seemingly bland elements, Cranberries warm brand of rock proves how earnestness, and a fantastic vocalist of course (the second-to-last singing of the album's title phrase in the closing track is simply stunning), transcend some of the bland familiarities often seen in similar setups.
0312330537|1.0|I didn't like this book.  I bought it because I love stories about India.  It's more my fault than the author.  Very well written, but the story left me empty.
0634049011|4.0|This is a worbook, it requires you to work through examples with the intention of learning how to recognize and recreate them yourself.  Examples include: major/rel. minor scale patterns, pentatonic scale patterns, arpeggio patterns, triad patterns, interval patterns and chord patterns.  There are also note patterns.  you are responsible for learning or memorizing these.  Please note that that author does not show you how to use these, he doesn't give you the context.  they are for learning purposes.  I would suggest his chord tone soloing book for context.      Also, you don't need to know how to read music to use this book.  I think he has a seperate book that covers that aspect.  It is a very useful skill if you do.      Overall this is an excellent workbook for the aspiring guitarist.  It will help open the fretboard to the diligent.
1932100660|5.0|It points out correct nutrition or diet can really cure a lot of major diseses instead of depending on chemical medication only. According to the book, whole grain foods, vegetables and no meat seems to be a better choice for the long-term health. It also points out many dark sides in the modern science or diet or medicine because it was controlled by too many greedy businessmen.
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|I was anxiously waiting for this movie after seeing the play and listening to Abba's music often.  When I saw the movie in the theater it was good, the large screen with the dark theater made you feel like you were on a Greek Island witnessing this event.  Then I ordered the DVD and watched the movie at home - what a difference!  I thought to myself, \\"This is a dumb movie\\".      Everyone agrees, the music makes the movie.  The plot is thin and it is a silly premise.  It works on stage, because in the theater you can use your imagination.  It doesn't work in the movie.  Unfortunately, I do not think I will ever watch the DVD again; I can listen to the CD and enjoy the music without feeling like I am wasting my time.    Meryl Streep is good, she can do anything.  She displays many emotions, and does it well.  She looks like she had fun making the movie; I hope she was actually enjoying the Greek experience rather than being on a set in Hollywood.
B001AIRUOU|4.0|We watched this with our 5-year-old and she wasn't scared of it at all. In fact, it's her new favorite DVD. Maybe it depends on your child, but to me this is a DVD that really is for the whole family. Good characters, inventive storytelling! Also liked the packaging.
B00003CWPR|1.0|Totally agree with another reviewer that said Tom Cruise was miscast as a doctor - totally unbelievable. I thought both he and Nicole Kidman's acting in this film was laughable. And since when does a doctor go around flipping open his I.D. card like a cop? Over and over again, AND people complying with whatever he wants because \\"HE'S A DOCTOR!\\". And what was the point of Nicole Kidman's gratitious nudity? - enough already. That and her rant about her doctor husband squeezing patient's \\"titties\\" - just sickening. Maybe this film would have succeded with better acting . . .

B0000009UG|4.0|As far as Bowie's 80's catalogue goes, this is pretty much the only album in really positive light.<br /><br />This album, to me, seems like a missing link, hybred from the art rock of Berlin and Bowie's glam rock saga, leaning more towards the sound and ideals of Aladdin Sane.  While AS and Berling comprise some of my all-time favorite Bowie releases, this particular album is not quite as I expected.<br /><br />The first 5 songs, including the second part of 'It's No Game' are to me the only real reasons I really like this album.  The other 4 tracks, sort of in the structure of 'Let's Dance' sound like filler, where aside from singles and some standout tracks these two albums just don't focus strongly on the other songs presented.  'Because You're Young' is good, not great, but the other 3 songs are to me fillers, which really causes this album to die out after Fashion, only to be picked up a little in the end.<br /><br />But after the great run of music from '76 to '79 I just feel that Bowie lost something artistically until getting his edge back with Tin Machine.<br /><br />The bonus material, however, is not to be missed.  Sure, this older CD release may not be remastered as best, but if you're like me and would rather obtain some hard to find recordings over only slightly better sound (providing you can even hear a difference) this is by far the better buy.

B000JMKRKC|3.0|I read all these great reviews and found out the book did not live up to the hype.  The story about a bookish, surviving twin woman in her 20's, living with her folks and working in a book store, feels like the 18th century.  Out of the blue, she gets the opportunity to bio a BIG NAME British writer and takes off for the moors.  Well, is this 21st century Britain?  Are folks still running around with pencils and paper writing books?  The story takes off with the dying BIG NAME claiming to being ready to confess it all.  Well, the story turns into incest, insanity, and mystery.  The tale is intellectually interesting, but the characters remained emotionally distant to me.  Of course there is the surprise ending, so you can think back, wow, should have seen it coming.  Similar to Edgar Sawtelle, a modern update of an old tale.  Entertaining, but not romantic, despite all the allusions to the Bronte sisters.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I missed the series on TV but was delighted to see the actors winning kudos for their protrayals.  It inspired me to buy the series and I was very glad I did.  It was a bit of history that I didn't remember from my high school days and I was very pleased to see it.  The costumes and acting were first rate.  I think both Paul Giamoti and Laura Linney are underrated as actors and I am glad to see them finally getting their due.  Great series.  Thx, Nancy

B0002JJBZY|5.0|I hate it when \\"They\\" muck up a good thing.<br /><br />Why cant well enough be left alone? Why does everything have to be redone, to be made shiny and new?<br /><br />Star Trek is a TV Classic. It was a child of it's time, cheezy special effects and all. It's as if the Borg Collective reached back into the Paramount offices, and took over, saying, \\"You must upgrade... you must conform...We will assimalate you\\".<br /><br />Star Trek does not need to be assimilated, updated, remastered, or fooled with. Fans of the show love it for what it is, an OLD TV show and the warts be dammned. The TOS of Star Trek IS TV history.<br /><br />So please, Paramount/CBS: Reissue this set, and allow new fans to see TOS as it originally aired. Don't be like the Borg, and bury a true slice of American TV history for the new and shiny.
B001G9LV9S|5.0|By the 1970 release of TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN, Cat Stevens had been an active performer in his native England for more than four years. He had his first UK hit (\\"I Love My Dog\\") in 1966, and had developed a reputation as a major songwriter. [P.P. Arnold had a UK hit with \\"The First Cut Is the Deepest\\" in 1967 (as would Rod Stewart ten years later), and the Tremeloes first U.S. hit was \\"Here Comes My Baby.\\"] Following a bout with tuberculosis in the late sixties, Cat Stevens left behind the  pop-oriented sound of his early work and emerged with this collection of more sensitive and introspective material.<br /><br />Longtime fans of Cat Stevens already know the magic of these songs' simple arrangements. Stevens is backed by Alun Davies on second guitar, John Ryan on bass, Harvey Burns on drums, and John Rostein (occasionally) on violin.<br /><br />This Deluxe Edition offers a second disc of live and demo recordings--some previously unreleased. [Previously released tracks are noted.]<br /><br />\\"Wild World\\" is a stunning solo demo version that in some ways is even more powerful than the studio version.<br /><br />\\"Longer Boats\\" and \\"Into White\\" were both recorded live at the Troubadour in 1970. Alun Davies provides guitar and backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"Miles from Nowehere\\" is another 1969 solo demo with Stevens playing guitar on piano.<br /><br />\\"Hard Headed Woman,\\" \\"Where Do the Children Play?\\" and \\"Sad Lisa\\" are all live performances from 1976 with a full band; the first from Japan, the others from the Majikat Earth Tour. [\\"Where Do the Children Play?\\" and \\"Sad Lisa\\" previously released.]<br /><br />\\"On the Road to Find Out\\" is live at KCET-TV in Los Angeles in 1971. Stevens is backed by Alun Davies (guitar) and Larry Steele (bass). [Previously released.]<br /><br />\\"Father and Son\\" and \\"Wild World\\" are 2006 live recordings from Usuf's Cafe. Amond the band members is Alun Davies on guitar and backing vocals. Thirty-six years after they were first recorded, these songs retain their impact in these new performances. [Previously released.]<br /><br />\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" is from a 1970 BBC Radio 1 transmission.<br /><br />While this Deluxe Edition is a bit pricey (I got mine for $10 from a record club), serious fans will want this just for the bonus material.

0316113077|5.0|This is the most wonderful book for any new, and experienced, cake decorator. You get basic recipes (which I have tried them all, and can say they are amazing! I do have a better chocolate cake recipe, but it was a very good one) and the details are thorough enough so you feel she is there helping you. As for one reviewer who said they would have liked to see more cakes than cookies, etc.: if you are that experienced that you wanted to see more cakes, then you shouldn't have bought this book. I'm pretty sure this was written for beginners, and it does say on the cover cupcakes, cookies and minicakes, not just cakes. I haven't yet attempted to actually cover a cake with the fondant, but I've just messed around sculpting it. I'll be brave enough one day... Definitely worth your money!

0743270754|3.0|I cannot reconcile the Lincoln in Doris Kearns Goodwin's book with the Lincoln in Joshua Wolf Shenk's book, \\"Lincoln's Melancholy.\\" In Goodwin's book, Lincoln emerges as the great president everybody agrees he was. Goodwin's emphasis on Lincoln's magnanimity is unforgettable and inspiring, as page after page, we see a blueprint of his generous and forgiving spirit. This aspect of Lincoln, more than any other perhaps, is what binds this tome of a book together. But according to Goodwin, Lincoln also had a sanguine, often even a buoyant spirit, as he went about telling his humorous stories to appreciative audiences. There is no mention, in Goodwin's book, of Lincoln's anguished and tormenting marriage, and, furthermore, no mention of Lincoln's chronic depression which Shenk talks about in his book. According to Shenk, humor helped Lincoln overcome his depression, which more than once led him to the verge of suicide. As Shenk notes, \\"After his melancholy emerged in his mid-twenties, and took a deeper hold in his thirties, Lincoln turned to humor for help\\" (116). Indeed, Goodwin mentions one episode of depression in Lincoln's youth, but she avoids any reference to the chronic depression Shenk writes about.  But why hide it? Lincoln's greatness is that much more tangible and admirable if he had to overcome the persistent onslaughts of melancholy (witnessed by many in his time).  As Shenk eloquently describes it, \\"It's not that his moods turned in a cycle, as day gives way to night, but that he lived in the night and made a strong effort to bring the sun in\\"(117). One of the reviewers remarked that Goodwin sees too much good in the people she admires, and I tend to agree, but I don't think it is a compliment in this context. Persistently, Goodwin seems to avoid complex psychological aspects in the leader she likes, and this is just a shame because the truth is more important.   One more thing: Goodwin's writing style is monotonous and tiring. She repeats the same vague adjectives and adverbs (i.e., \\"pleasing,\\" \\"lavish,\\" \\"cheerful,\\" \\"unpleasant,\\" \\"impeccable,\\" \\"unsurprisingly\\") over and over again, as if there were no other words in the language. Hers is seviceable prose--unbecoming of such a noble and arching enterprise. She should take lessons from the writings of the 19th century reporters she, fortunately, quotes so often. They knew their craft!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Bravo has been showing West Wing re-runs each morning, allowing my wife and I to catch about two-thirds of each episode before commuting to work. Frustrated, we bought each other the complete set and now watch 1-2 uninterrupted episodes every other evening or so.  Aaron Sorkin's intelligent, timely, quick-paced and humor-laced dialogue and the ensemble's precise execution make The West Wing better than ANYTHING on TV today.  Certainly closer to reality than anything billed as \\"reality\\" television.  The fact my wife and I both like it speaks to its appeal across gender and political loyalty.  Beyond its superb content, the complete set is artfully packaged and well documented.  (With proper caution there is no problem removing and replacing the DVDs to avoid scratching, complaints notwithstanding.)<br /><br />Understanding the parameters of TV entertainment, Wing Nuts appreciate how the series' suggest the conscience, complexity and discourse inherent in the inner workings of government.  It is, in this context, good education.  But for those seeking the lighter side, the dynamics of the characters, the dialogue and, yes, the humor are in themselves entertaining.  By the time one views the 154 episodes and background commentaries, you'll be ready to begin the series again.  (And, on more than one occasion, we've wondered if we could just elect the Bartlet Administration and put them in office!  Somehow, I can see myself trusting these guys.)

B000F8DB4O|5.0|When I first listened to the album, I frankly did not enjoy it much, particularly compared to the great releases in the 80s.  However, I got a chance to relisten to the album on the drive to a Metheny concert (he's unbelievable live, btw) and I was hooked.      This album is smooth as silk--whether or not it is acid jazz it is just an addicting album.  I loved the way many of the tracks build in intensity, particularly \\"To The End Of The World\\" and \\"Something To Remind You.\\"  This is another great winner for one of the best artists of our era!
B00005LOUQ|5.0|This film took the story of Grinch and stretched it by having Jim Carrey act the leading comedy role. Expertly filmed and directed, most people will find the Grinch very funny, that is, if you like Jim Carrey's style of comedy. If you are a dedicated fan of Dr. Seuss, you may find that this rendition takes too many liberties with the original story. However, our family watches Grinch at least twice a year, especially near Christmas, and continue to laugh and laugh. Kids will love it.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|The CD arrived quickly.  It was well packaged.  Love almost the entire CD.  My only complaint is that there is a little static before one of the songs. Luckily, this is only in one spot and does not deter from listening to the rest of the CD.  I would recommend this seller and would buy from them again.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Let me first say that \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull \\"is not a perfect film. It's not the genre defining film \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was back in 1981. But, simply put... it doesn't have to be. I've rarely seen a more fun and exciting film that has been criticized for such petty things. It's been called by some an over-the-top and impossible film. You know what...They're absolutely right! And that's exactly what makes it so great to watch. For 27 years, the Indiana Jones series has always been pushing the limits of what an adventure movie can be. So, if you're someone who's not a fan of cliffhanging adventure with highly improbable set-pieces and doses of the supernatural, then this film is not for you. But if being highly entertained for two hours by watching everyone's favorite archeologist get himself in and out of every mess conceivable, sounds like fun, then this film is right up your alley. There's little need to recap the plot. We have Indy and co. chasing and protecting the mystical Crystal Skull of Akator while dodging numerous bad guys along the way. Set pieces abound throughout in classic Indy fashion all framed by the one and only Steven Spielberg who, despite reports to the contrary, deeply cares about this film, and as much as anyone wanted to make it work. And work it does. There's terrific chases through warehouses, college campuses and dense Amazonian jungles. All set to a rousing score by the master, John Williams. And in the end, it's Harrison Ford, who even at 65, manages to get around better than most 30 year olds.     Also, please keep in mind, that the film is set in the 1950s, and Lucas specifically wanted the film to reflect the sci-fi flavor of the era, so things do get a  bit more fantastical than in previous films. But it's nice to know that after all these years, everyone involved still wants to go for broke. And I love that. So if you can set aside years of expectations and simply watch the film as it was intended, then I know you'll have a great time. And in the end that's all this film was ever created to do.    Unfortunately, it does seem true that more and more audience members today want realism, grittiness and logic and cannot seem to just let that go and simply have fun. Kind of a shame.    Just my opinion of course.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is an elemental expression of humanity.   It is art.  So full of pathos, so full of joy.  It will last 100 years.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|How this movie escaped public acclaim in theater release is mysterious. Cute, intelligently romantic comedies usually find an audience before they are released to DVD. Although $53 million is a decent box office  gross (Notting Hill did twice that) almost no one ever saw this gem until it hit HBO. Experiencing it in 1080i made me convinced that 1080p would be spectacular and I was not disappointed.     The Irish scenes in particular, with their fields of wildflowers and greening meadows, are almost dreamlike. Such  cinematographic romanticism as a set for a tale of true love and discovery, makes PS I Love You a necessary buy for any decent Blu-ray library.
B00005O3VC|5.0|What can I say, I'm a Monty Python fan and this is their all time best!
B0013N4AT0|4.0|I think \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" was a better album then this but it cannot be denied that Still Life showcases some amazing muscianship by everyone in the band. Opeth are without a doubt some of the best musicians in metal these days and almost every song on this album highlights this arguable fact. The stand out tracks for me are \\"The Moor\\", \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" and \\"White Cluster\\" and the only track I really don't like is \\"Benighted\\" but that is only because the singer is fairly weak when it comes to the clear vocals thing and the whole song is clear.           This is an atmospheric album without a doubt and it is worthy of picking up whether you are into metal or not. If non metal fans can get over the growls  and the seriously weak clear vocal style they might be pleasantly surprised by the awesome musical gifts these guys have in creating soundscapes that take you right into the songs and the stories they tell.
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|As a musical it was good.  I thought the plot rather sophomoric.  Good scenery, good acting.
B000005HO0|5.0|The first BM track I ever heard was the \\"Funeral Fog\\" recording from this album and it blew me away. This was raw and real black metal with zero gimmicks. It's underproduced, the band isn't on top of their game but this is black metal and it's black metal with it's most famous line up, this excuses the trashy sound in my view. Funeral Fog, The Freezing Moon and Deathcrush are all classics and I guess I never liked Mayhem beyond this. There is something sinister and evil in this production and Dead's growling that makes this one of the defining moments in black metal recording history. If you're an old schooler like me this is a no brainer but if you're just getting into black metal step outside the new Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir keyboard goth pop and step back in time with some of the true purveyors of black metal. Back before the black metal scene exploded and the scene got turned into something on the fringe of the mainstream there was this, and this is as good as it gets.
0385339682|4.0|i was very pleased with this purchase.  it came exactly as the seller described and in the same time frame as advertised.  i would definitely order from this vendor again.
B000305ZS4|5.0|Emperor created a winner with this opus of black metal majesty. They created a sound and an atmosphere entirely their own and managed to use keyboard melodies without sounding cheesy throughout the entire album. This alone is worth mention since many bands go the keyboard route and it goes from evil to goth pop hilarity in a heartbeat.     Emperor create a dark and wild pagan soundscape and do it in such a way that the music sucks you in from the intro to the end of the album. Despite the poor production this is the most sweeping and epic Black Metal album ever recorded and captures the essence of what the scene was trying to communicate to people. It speaks of desolate Northern forests, wolves, moonscapes, evil and the vast emptiness and wildness of nature and does it in a truly majestic way. Even after all these years I can listen to this and get sucked into the music. Anyone who says there is no musical talent in metal hasn't heard this, and if you can't get beyond the production you probably shouldn't be listening to black metal anyway. The production adds to the atmosphere in ways that have to be heard to be believed. If you're new to black metal this is a mandatory album to listen to. As good as it ever got, end of story.
B001EO748M|1.0|The product was suppose to be delivered betewwn January 22 and Feb 6 2009.  I emailed the seller three times asking for status and never received an anser.  I order via the internet all the time and seldom have I come across this type of seller.  Buyers should avoid this seller.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Started watching this half way through the 1st season. Became a fan immediately. I even bought 5 more DVDs for my friends and family as Christmas gifts and now they are hooked too. The writing is smart and fun. I catch something new every time I watch it, whether it is a prop, clothing or dialogue. Makes me have a good laugh every time. I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out on DVD even though I have watched all the episodes so far. I know I have missed things in each episode
0446615625|5.0|Wish I would have read this one earlier so that some of the later books involving the \\"Camel Club\\" would have made better sense. I'm glad I read it now.  Baldacci is excellent as always.  It's fun to try and figure out the real evil doer before the end.
B00000612G|5.0|\\"Falling from Graceland\\" on \\"Undiscovered Soul,\\" is one of the most healing songs I have ever heard. The cd itselef is a variety of styles, some Americana, some R&B, some blues, ballads, love songs and more. A real montage of feeling. Sambora is much more than a handsome man, much more than what he looks like, much more than the guitarist for Bon Jovi, much more than one of the greatest guitarists in music history. He is an excellent vocalist. He is an excellent songwriter. Richie Sambora, will I hope, get the real credit he deserves one day.
034537410X|5.0|Lucid dreaming is one of the most unusual and interesting things I've ever learned about. This book teaches you everything you need to know and more about how to have them. To give you an example of how powerful the methods are, think about this: It has been over a year since I have actively practiced the techniques I learned in this book, and I still have lucid dreams several times a week. This is a well written and fascinating book, I highly recommend it.
0446618306|5.0|You can always tell you're reading a great book when you find yourself skipping ahead into the final chapters to see how things will be resolved, even though you've vowed you wouldn't. Love doesn't always have a happy ending (especially when it comes to a Nicholas Sparks novel) and this is a wonderful (albeit quick) tear-jerking romance with a lesson given on sacrifice before love or happiness.<br /><br />Our hero John grew up with a silent, meticulously organized father that he didn't understand. In his teens he began to rebel, hanging out, playing pool and drinking. This continues for a number of years with John working menial jobs, getting several tattoos and going nowhere fast. Eventually John decides its time to grow up and he joins the army. In fact it's during 2 weeks leave that he first meets Savannah, diving into the ocean to rescue her sinking purse. Savannah is your stereotypical good-girl; raised in a stable family she's kind, pretty and hopes to save the world. It's also love at first sight for our couple despite the warnings from her tattoo phobic college friends. Together the pair plans a future together, counting down the days until John's discharge as Savannah helps him understand his father and he in turn feels contentment for the first time in his life.<br /><br />On Sept 11 everything changes as John in a moment of patriotic loyalty chooses to re-up in the army, putting a hold on their marriage plans while he enters the war in Iraq. The  two try to maintain a long distance relationship but the war changes John and the years apart put a strain on their deep love. When John's father grows ill he returns home but will he be too late to save both his relationship with his father and the love of his life?<br /><br />I fell in love with John's character and surprisingly his father too. Each is well written and they felt like real people. I also enjoyed reading about John's military career and the reasons that take men into a war. Savannah as the heroine was a little too perfect for me but their heartbreaking love story and the regret that they both share will keep you up into the wee hours, and leave you wondering about John long after you've finished reading its bittersweet ending.<br /><br />Another great read from Nicholas Sparks that I would definitely recommend. Oh, and John if you're out there, I'm single...rfect for me but their heartbreaking love story and the regret that they both share will keep you up into the wee hours, and leave you wondering about John long after you've finished reading its bittersweet ending.    Another great read from Nicholas Sparks that I would definitely recommend. Oh, and John if you're out there, I'm single...
B00127RAJY|4.0|First off, let me say I am a indoor cycling instructor. I consider myself to be in fairly good CARDIO shape although i rarely do weights of any kind. I found this tape to be a nice way for me to get an upper body workout on my \\"days off\\" cycling. I have done level 1 an level 2 with not many probems but i do think some of the basic exercises she does may not be good for anyone with back or hip problems. I have been so sore the next day (mostly in my shoulders and back muscles) that i've never been able to do this tape 2 days in a row. Hopefully I'll get there. The moves are simple but it is fast paced and you DO NOT rest for 20+mins. Of all videos i've done i do like the fact that this one is only 20-25 mins because any longer and you would be bored (or die of exhaustion)

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost Season 4 continues one of the best series I think ever put on television to date.  All your favorite characters are back, with new hurdles and challenges to keep you on the edge of your seat.  As always, some new characters have come on board - adding to the depth and mystery of the island.  In previous seasons, the episodes focused on alternating between life on the island and flashbacks by the characters.  In Season 4, you get all the flashbacks that you love and also get what can only be called flashforwards!  Certain survivors end up making it off the island and the show's writers have woven interesting plot twists into the usual fare.  This is a must have in order to not get \\"lost\\" with Lost.  Only negative thing at all about this season on DVD is that the number of episodes was only 12.  Pretty short for an entire season, hopefully in the current season 5 they will give us more episodes like we have grown accustomed to from the previous seasons.  If you haven't yet watched this series - get on board and see what you have been missing!!
0765342294|5.0|This book is well executed, brilliant and revolutionary. However unrealistic it may be- it still shows great evolution of the character and his attributes and fulfills a primitive need for warfare and the birth of an epiphany after you read it. A great book almost all-around; it also lacks Card's religious outlook which shows his massive strength as a writer.
0385474547|4.0|I am glad i didn't have to read this book in high school. i probably wouldn't have liked it back then. but now i did enjoy it. it is easy to read and understand. i liked to read about the tribal life and i think Okonokwo is a great character. he has so many faults and yet with time one grows to like him.

0064407667|5.0|Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, orphaned after a terrible fire, are sent (or sentenced) to live with Count Olaf, who is supposedly a relative but whom the children have never met.  As it turns out, their instincts are correct -- the Count is determined to get his creepy, long-nailed hands on the substantial Baudelaire fortune, no matter the cost.  The first of a thirteen-book series, The Bad Beginning kicks things off with a unique, classically charming, and delightfully grisly story.    What stands out the most in this quick, page-turning read is Snicket's inimitable voice.  The narration is clever, engaging, and never-before-seen in a completely indescribable way.  Snicket strays from traditional story-telling and acts as the bearer of bad tidings, frequently warning us of horrible events to come and humorously pausing to define potentially confusing phrases for our benefit.    The story is tightly-knit and clean, and thus is enjoyable for all ages.  The character of Count Olaf is wrapped in cliche, but he takes on his own style and leaves other greedy schemers in the dust.  The children are commendable heroes, all likeable and with distinctive traits particular to each.    All in all, this beginning is anything but bad.  Writing like that of Lemony Snicket is a rarity, and not one that should be passed up.  I heartily recommend this book (and its successors) to anyone and everyone old enough to read.
B000002L9J|5.0|Wow..fellow fags will like the songs on here and straight alike..\\"The Queen Is Dead\\" is a prescence..lyrics to some of these songs meaningful like you've never heard: \\"Oh mother I can feel the soil falling over my head..I know it's over though I cling I don't know where else I can go..loutish lover treat her kindly though she needs you more than she loves you..\\" \\"The boy with the thorn in his side..behind the hatred there lies a murderous desire for love..\\" from \\"The Boy With A Thorn In His Side.\\" \\"No I never had no one ever..\\" from yes \\"Never Had No One Ever\\"..\\"Now I'm outside your house,I'm alone.I hate to intrude..\\"\\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" is probably the  best song musically of a lot of their songs.The best album is ([[ASIN:B000024971 Strangeways, Here We Come]])I think.Croon along with \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" from ([[ASIN:B000002L7J Meat Is Murder]])..for the heck of it too.Never identify more with a song: \\"AT the car by the side of the road  you should know time's tide may smother you,and I will too.When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely their only desire is to die,well I'm afraid<br />it doesn't make me smile.I wish I could laugh..but that joke isn't funny anymore..It's too close to home and it's too near the bone more than you'll ever know..I've seen this happen in other peoples lives and now it's happening in mine..\\"
0452286751|4.0|I read the Fountainhead for the first time 20 years ago after graduating from College.  It was the most memorable and thought-provoking literary experience of my life and had a profound impact on my views of the world at the time.  Within weeks of finishing The Fountainhead, I read Atlas Shrugged and was further captivated by the Randian philosophies of objectivism and individualism.      For the past 20 years, I have retained much of what I learned from those books, but have also acquired 20 years of real-world adulthood and experience.  With that backdrop, I recently decided that it was time to go back and reread the Fountainhead.  I was curious whether the messages conveyed to a 21 year old graduate would still carry the same impact and resonance.      I picked up the book 5 days ago and finished it last night.  I was once again enraptured by the story and simply couldn't put the book down to go to sleep any night this week.  The characters and dialog were still fascinating and entertaining and I was pleased that certain tenets of the Randian philosophy stayed true with me after all these years.  That being said, with an adult's perspective, I also found the characters to be completely implausible and their relationships with each other to be borderline silly.  While the dialogs were captivating, they weren't real.  Whether it was Rourke and Wynand expounding on the yacht or Toohey spending 3 pages in a long-winded diatribe with Keating toward the end of the novel, there were simply too many instances where Rand unabashedly uses conversation to spout her philosophy with total disregard for how people actually converse with each other.  Thus I had more of a sense this time around that The Fountainhead was a philosophy textbook disguised as a novel.    The main thing that struck me this time around was that Rand can't seem to find a middle-ground with her characters . . . and this again makes them unreal.  When I was 21, I misguidedly believed that adults could actually be as Rand describes.  What did I know?  Now I view these characters as unnaturally extreme, rigid and one and two dimensional.  They are nothing more than cardboard representations of certain ideals, caricatured to the nth degree.  Roark and Toohey are not real men . . . they are Randian fantasy creatures.  For entertainment purposes, I enjoyed being reacquainted with them, but I have no illusions that they are based on actual human beings.  Dominique.  Puh-lease.  Her storyline is so absurd that I could only laugh my way through it.  Wynand . . . I'm still not sure what to make of him and I still don't really understand what Roark would see in a friendship with Wynand.  Whatever.    Long story short, with a grain of salt and a suspension of disbelief, this is still an entertaining and educational novel.  Despite the extremes, there is much to be learned and applied from the Randian ideals: strive to achieve and excel, think for yourself, exist for yourself not for others or for some imaginary higher power, don't be dependent upon others, hold sacred and don't compromise your integrity, stick to your convictions.

B00004XPPK|4.0|This is one of those films I never think is all that good, but I keep going back to it every four or five years. Perhaps it's just to get another look at Rita Hayworth while she was still THE glamor woman of the period (1940 to about 1948). At times, she is just jaw-dropping stunning.    Glenn Ford provides some narration and does his normally-competent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more. He is really good as the rich husband, just fascinating to watch.    This film would have been so much better had it been cut about 20 minutes. It bogs down a little over halfway through (but recovers). The dialog is what makes this story interesting for the most part, particularly in the first half of the film which is far better than the second half, and that includes the cinematography. The second half is a lot more melodrama than film noir.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called \\"Cream.\\" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.    Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.    Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, \\"Spoonful,\\" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.    Highly recommended.
B000059XUO|5.0|Just watched it for the first time today (Collector's Series) and it was great! First off, yes I am a Bruce Lee fan but I knew this film would not be like one of his. Brandon was perfect for this role especially after watching the interview with the creator of the book/comic that it's based on. The film has a dark, muggy, and redemption feel to it through out the movie. The fighting scenes were great because they weren't over the top but yet enough to keep the mood right and show another side to Brandon's acting. The movie moved at a great pace, not too fast and not too long. You just have to watch it to experience what Brandon was capable of. R.I.P. Bruce and Brandon.

Whatever the reason, despite friends and family there are people who are painfully lonely, watching couples around them with an aching jealousy like that of a starving person watching others eat. Holidays can amplify that feeling of being alone as the world around you seems focused on reminding you that you have no one to share your life with.  [[ASIN:0811868419 This Is for You]] is a beautiful, poignant, interestingly and artistically presented story that gives hope that there is a heart out there that beats with yours. You are not alone. You can have hope.    A friend gave me this book today as a Valentines Day gift and there are no words in the English language to describe how deeply it has touched my heart.
B000VR824S|4.0|This is an amazing showcase of guitarist and the excitement generated by the unsurpassed talent of musicians who performed.  This DVD gets multiple plays during outdoor BBQ parties in my back yard.  It sounds and looks great.    The reason I'm giving only four stars is the editing/decision to limit this showcase to only 2 discs.  It could have easily been 3 or 4 discs to include more of the Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks sets.  It was obvious that the appearance Jeff Beck took the show to another level yet there were only two songs on the disc (his set was actually 12 songs).  I keep looking for a Volume 2 of this show but I doubt that will ever come.  Hopefully future \\"Crossroads\\" concerts will not be so heavily edited.  In the meantime this is all there is so enjoy it.

This book honestly seemed like an attempt to meet the requirements of a contract, rather than a real exploration of a story.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|This movie is a bit vaginal.  Girl power.  I don't like that.  I liek heroism untainted by curses or woman demons having the upper hand.  A bit depressing.  I love the work of Robert E Howard.  Such uncluttered fun.  This movie was better than expected because I had heard it was horrendous.  I will read the story now to see if it is accurate or if they juiced up the pussy power.  Zemekis seems a weasil and he kinda is. If only John Milius was given this script.
0757302661|5.0|When I read this book I was about 5.5 months along.  I immediately switched over all my prenatal care at 6 months to a midwife and did a home birth.  This book helped educate me on the process our bodies go through and how to labor, which most women neglect to research.  They go in with the mindset to just \\"go with the flow\\"...which is hard if you don't know what to expect in that flow!  I had an amazing birth experince, all at home, no complications.  Bought the rainbow CD and had it on repeat the entire time.  I can't wait to have another baby (and labor!) to experince that high again.  I also wanted to say that this is the one of the first times I have ever written a review on anything...and am happy to do so to spread the word!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|This is a great movie and a great DVD release.  Just to make clear to the reviewer below.  To access the extended director's cut, you must press play first and then comes the option between the theatrical version or the extended one.  Ok?
B00005JJX8|5.0|What can I say about an Alfred Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, set in the south of France, that hasn't been said before?  Marvelous, it's one of my favorite films of all times, great comedy- Jessie Royce Landis as Grace Kelly's nouveau rich, great-hearted mother is funny and fabulous!- The stars are superb and the background, both the Cote d'Azur as background to the story and the real-life background of Grace Kelly's meeting Prince Rainier during filming, make it all the more enjoyable. If you have never seen it, you should!
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|The transfer looks great and the 5.1 sound is vivid with a nice spectrum.      This is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen.  Beautifully edited, with a terrific performances (Gary Oldman is so eerie as Oswald, you'd think they had resurrected the lone assassin), this is definitely Oliver Stone's masterpiece in a canon of interesting films.    The scope of the film is epic, and although he gives you a hodgepodge of theories, the beauty of this picture is that you, the audience, can walk away with your own theory.  But most importantly, Stone's message is that we the people must take a stance and interest in our government and hold those who break the law accountable.  We need to question those around us.  And above all, we must demand PEACE from our leaders and for the world.    When I saw this film in 1991, is was overwhelmed by it's sheer power and unforgettable imagery.    Definitely worth the price.  And the gorgeous John Williams score has never sounded more majestic and American than in True HD.
B001P3SA94|3.0|Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. SASS biopic of Leonard Chess, co-founder of Chess Records, played by Adrian Brody<br />2. Quick look at Chicago in the time of segregation<br />3. Stirring portrayal of Muddy Waters by Jeffrey Wright<br />4. Short history of Little Walter, played by Columbus Short<br />5. Quick peek at Chuck Berry, portrayed by Mos Def<br />6. Quick leer at Etta James, portrayed by Beyonce<br />7. Passing glimpses of Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer)<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it doesn't go deep enough into anything, skimming the historical and background stuff to focus instead on cars, cigarettes, alcohol and assorted misbehavior.  The main thing you'll learn here is not what made these legends tick, but that they really, really liked Cadillacs.<br /><br />A good cast, great music and a story that could have been a lot better than this.  The stories of these Rock and Roll Hall of Famers deserve more than this superficial skim.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 14, 2009
B000002H2H|5.0|As mentioned in the title of this review, RTL was the first metal album I ever purchased back in 1996 at the tender age of 12, and I still listen to it to this day. It has always been one of my personal favorites, and it stands up as one of the best thrash metal albums of all time. It's the album that truly got me into metal and I feel it's the best Metallica record. MOP comes close, but not quite. Metallica perfected their incredible talent, and worked out the kinks from their thrash happy, raw first album Kill Em All, with this gem of a sophomore effort. Now, on to the review.    1. Fight Fire With Fire - The first song of the 8 track onslaught sets the tone well, as it begins quietly with acoustic guitar, and then it changes with a heavy thrash explosion like a punch in the face. It plays fast and furious throughout, until it comes to a stop with an explosion to end the metal assault. Very good opening song, something Metallica has always done well. 4/5  2. Ride The Lightning - The title track of the album dosen't dissappoint. It has a very solid, heavy riff, and Kirk Hammett busts out arguably his best solo on the album. Great vocals in this one too, especially in the chorus of the song. 5/5  3. For Whom The Bell Tolls - Perhaps the most popular song on the album with most people. It starts out with two gongs of a bell, and then continues with a great melodic sounding guitar riff. One of the best intros to any song they've done. Sounds very cool with the bell going throughout the song, and makes for a great dramatic effect. 5/5  4. Fade To Black - My personal favorite Metallica song not only on this album, but I would venture to say of all time. It really has everything you could ask for in a great song. It begins with a beautiful acoustic pattern and some lead guitar mixed in as well. Once the first few lines are sung, it builds into a heavy riff that grabs you and dosen't let go. Kirk Hammett rounds out the song with an absolutely incredible solo that will have you headbanging for sure! I think that it's the best written song on the record and the guitars mesh so well and sound better than any other song on the album. A HUGE 5/5!!  5. Trapped Under Ice - A very heavy, speed metal tune that includes a galloping, in-your-face riff that will make you want to start throwing things!!Not in my top 5 favorites on the album, but still very strong. 3/5  6. Escape - The weakest song from this offering in my opinion. Still not bad, but it's just softer and packs less punch than the others. For this to be the weakest song is saying alot though, because it's still heavy and I certainly wouldn't say it's one of Metallica's worst songs. 2/5  7. Creeping Death - Here we go, now it's time to rock!! This one comes close as my favorite, second only to Fade to Black. The riffs in it are so tight and Hammett is at the top of his game with his solo work. It rocks so hard from start to finish, and the lyrics are creative and creepy at the same time. This song IS thrash!! 5/5  8. The Call Of Ktulu - This is my favorite Metallica instumental-hands down. It starts with a nice string arrangement, and then builds up to a thundering guitar assault. Great lead work by Hammett in this one, as he really shows why he's one of the greatest thrash lead guitarists of all time. It's the longest track at 8:53, but worth every minute. 4/5    Well, there you have it. My review of Ride The Lightning. Hope this helps in your decision to buy the album. I highly recommend it to anyone who is into thrash/speed metal music. If you're new to Metallica and looking for the best album to start with, look no further than this album. You won't regret it.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) heads off Down Under to find out what her hubby is really doing when he says he's mustering cattle.<br />2. Kidman's performance is her best since Far and Away, and the cattle ranch Down Under is named Faraway Downs - coincidence or lingering sentiment?<br />3. Super hot Aussie all-rounder and hoofer Hugh Jackman heats up the screen as Drover, the Crocodile Dundee-type chappy who rounds up the cattle on the hoof.<br />4. Turns out that Lady Sarah ends up in the middle of a cattle war with the reigning King Carney (Bryan Brown) and his slimy sidekick Neil Fletcher (David Wenham)<br />5. Some of the story is narrated by Nullah (Brandon Walters) a young half-caste boy who sends Lady Sarah's heart over the rainbow<br />6. No prizes for guessing who else sets her heart aflutter<br />7. When droving cattle towards a billabong, never say Never Never<br />8. Still about two hours to go for this epic romance/adventure/drama that highlights the fate of half-Aboriginal children known as the Stolen Generations with the backdrop of the Japanese bombing of Darwin during WWII<br />9. You won't notice how long you've been sitting there<br /><br />After watching this movie you'll want to know why it hasn't been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. (It's up for Costume Design) You'll find that it's both a heart-breaking and heart-warming memorable epic movie with big sets, gorgeous scenery, award-worthy costumes, magic and mysticism, humor, and yes, great acting.<br /><br />Caution: Watching this movie may give one the urge to:<br /><br />1. Load up a tucker-bag and head off on a walkabout<br />2. Throw another shrimp on the barbie<br />3. Tie a kangaroo down, Sport<br />4. Watch Judy Garland movies<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 14, 2009
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I haven't read the book by Roald Dahl, but I intend to do it soon. However, I've watched the two movie versions of this story. Frankly, I preferred the first one, where Willy Wonka was played by Gene Wilder who, in my opinion, presented his characer as dark, (of course) tender, humorous and it was a movie which I watched when I was the same age as the main charater, Charlie Bucket. The new version has many innovative technical methods and beautiful and colourful scenes and an enigmatic Johnny Depp. This is the story of five children who finding out the golden ticked inside a chocolate bar, have the right to visit the famous and weird factory accompanied by one of their parents. Four children are mean and one has a good heart. Who will be the winner to the special prize promised by Willy Wonka? Their behaviour will be their destiny... I give four stars, as the movie is very well made and I love Johnny Depp as an actor. But it lacks more comedy and tenderness,as it also exists inside Mr. Wonka's heart.
0061649708|5.0|This was the greatest book I've read in a very long time.  When you read the first few pages, you think it's a very childish story, but within minutes, you're feeling chills as Neil Gaiman describes Coraline's journey in the Other World in squirming, button-eye-tapping detail.  You're sure to be more than a bit creeped out when the Other Mother presents Coraline with a memorable gift that will make you hands fly to cover your eyes.  It's a brief but memorable journey that will haunt your dreams.  I highly recommend taking the plunge and going through that door.
B00005K9LM|5.0|I have always owned a copy of this album since it was released in 1984. I think it is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. If your a teenager who is tired of todays metal- then give this one a  listen. It don't get any better than this. I was disapointed with the Priests follow up \\"Turbo\\". They went in a total different direction with that one.You can get this one new for around $11.
B001E75QGG|1.0|This movie took everything that made the other films great and threw them out the window.  There is a reason this movie was named Worst Movie of the Year by film critics.    It is to the Raiders Legacy what jar Jar and Episode I  is to Star Wars.  Painful to watch.
B001DHXT20|3.0|I had very low expectations for another \\"Hulk\\" movie, after the Ang Lee disaster, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\". I was surprised that this wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Edward Norton is not bad as the weakling bruce banner and Liv Tyler is actually pretty good actress in this. There were even a few times when I was scared. The main problem I think is that the Tim Roth bad guy hideous character was too contrived to keep the story believable, but whatever it's a comic book so who gives a damn.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The Disney version of Beauty and the Beast is quite a mission to get hold of in South Africa, and remains a all time classic. Quality of the DVD was in a great condition. Can't believe it's a used product.

B001K61O6C|4.0|I don't yet have a SACD player, but I've been buying hybrids since I can enjoy the remastered CD layers now, and be building a SACD collection for that day in the future.  With few exceptions, hybrid CD layers are superior to the regular issues, although I've been burned a couple of times when it was obvious that they simply put the old CD version on it instead of using DSD and down-converting to 16 bit PCM.<br /><br />Interestingly, this CD layer is not much of an improvement over the 2002 remaster except that things hold up much better when the mix gets crowded and many instruments kick in and get loud. At this point, the 2002 remaster gets thin while the MFSL version hangs in there. This alone might be enough reason for an audiophile to pick this up.
B0018M6J90|5.0|When Miss Pettigrew (Frances MacDormand) is bounced from another nanny position for being a bit of a free spirit in London on the cusp of World War Two, she is rescued and in turn rescues an even wilder child (played by \\"Enchanted's\\" Amy Adams) who may or may not give up the screwball vida comedica she lives for True Love (Lee Pace of the much-missed \\"Pushing Daisies\\"). As the women navigate the Art Deco world of entertainers, producers, rich kids and fashion mavens, both learn about when to hold them and when to fold them. What does this mean? See the movie and, between the laughs, be prepared to fall in love with two very different women at once.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I discovered E.G's N&S by browsing for more period drama/ literary adaptations to watch/ own, having exhausted all the Jane Austen/ Bronte sisters fare from BBC/ A&E. I have to say I was a little dubious at first: the DVD is a little expensive, but ultimately very worth it! All the praise is true: this film adaptation is beautifully acted and filmed. I dropped everything and watched the whole thing in one sitting. Certainly on par with my all time favorite A&E P&P adaptation w/ C.Firth and J.Ehle. Margaret is a  strong, beautiful, independent but believable heroine and Mr. Thorton is just smoldering! Five stars! Buy it!
B00012QM8G|1.0|I previously owned the movie on VHS, but wanted the more compact DVD.  The first DVD started skipping around 50 minutes, then froze.  My newer DVD player spit it out at that point and said it was unplayable.  I took it back to the store I bought it (not amazon) and received a new copy.  The look of the DVD was different so I was hoping the problem was fixed.  This time I got 1 hour and 15 minutes in again and the same thing happened.  I looked at this DVD and it has a large scratch on it.  Now I have to trudge back to the store a third time to see if I can actually get a copy that will allow me to watch the entire movie.  Good thing I have seen it before.
B0000C5RQF|4.0|I wish Amazon would allow us to give fractions of stars - this should be 4.8 stars. The negative (apart from the mysogyny endemic in the opera) is the Sarastro, who is a total waste of time. A real pity, because the rest of the cast is stellar!    Dorothea Roschman is an excellent Pamina. She sings and acts well, and despite being less than slim, is light on her feet and a delight to watch and hear most of the time.    Diana Damrau will take your breath away. Her acting is not that good, but the sheer power of her voice will rock you. Her looks, even through the grotesque make-up, adds to the general pleasure of watching her. The costumes of the Queeen of the night and of her three ladies is just perfect!    The best person on stage is Simon Keenlyside, who has taken the character of Papageno to heart, or perhaps has become the heart of Papageno. I have never seen the part so well acted and sung. The DVD is worth it for this alone. His exit scene with Papagena is so cleverly staged, you wonder why no one ever thought of it before.    A special mention must be made of the singer who takes on the role of the older of the two priests. He is an excellent actor and the interactions with Papageno are some of the best theatre on the disc.    There are things to quibble about, but who cares, this is a magnificent performance of an exquisite piece of vocal theatre
B00004RF9B|4.0|Forbidden Planet is a great movie, if you really understand it. I would seriously not reccomend this to children under 10 since they will get bored and not understand this at all. Also, some of the kids today might not find this entertaining and instead old-fashioned. As fun as this movie is, this is the sad truth and kids nowadays are impressed by video games and other stuff. (Remember when those red and blue 3D glasses were cool.) Sometimes, however, you'll find a few kids who enjoy this! This particular edition should never be put in a decent DVD upconverter. You will see so many specks and dirt on the picture. All in all, this is a good movie, but you need to be the kind to enjoy it.
141690977X|3.0|Well here's my problem with the book; often times a man doesn't know he's into you until he tests the waters a bit. I think that's for many men. I personally 'psychologically size up' (I admit I do this more than most men) the women I consider going out with for potential problems i.e. clinginess, obsessiveness, time consumption, craziness, ego-centrism etc. This usually occurs within the first 2 months if I consider a woman to date. If I don't feel she is a good fit I won't pursue her as I think that is better for the both of us.   This book claims that a man would almost do anything in his pursuit of a woman, but honestly is that necessarily a positive trait? He may be ignoring his own health, not pursuing financial interests, being too involved in your life which, which overall, is not healthy for a couple. And honestly, if women think that is a positive trait, I don't think a man would want to date a woman like that. That just means she's selfish!  My personal belief is that both parties contribute to make it work. Sometimes a woman has to treat a man well before he reciprocates and vice-versa. If women believe that it is the man's responsibility, then I think its already set for failure.

B0013XS8A2|5.0|Mike Oldfield has had a great music career, but his latest work \\"Music of the Spheres\\" is a departure from the more electronic syhthenthised sounds of the past to a more classical style piece with Mr. Oldfield's mixing of voice, guitar and piano intertwined.  The music is actually one powerfull work from end to end completely circular.  If you haven't heard this music you are missing the most romantic and powerfull works, that has been recently created.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|Kudos for having both theatrical and directors cut on the same blu-ray.  The quality is stunning and the sound is chimed to perfection.  This is an unusual film.  It is a noir science fiction.  Think Bogart meets the Borg from Star Trek.  Not for the casual film fan.

B0013D8LKO|4.0|This 2 disk version contains the orgy scenes without the computer generated graphics that occur in the American release. The differences are of short duration, but they make an interesting comparison.
B001F0VHEM|2.0|I love Pink, but this isn't her best work.  There's only 3 decent songs on the album.....not worth it to buy.
B001KL3GY0|3.0|In preparation for \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" I listened to the bands first two cds. 2004's \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" and 2005's \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\".<br /><br />Although \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" offers up some keyboard textures and some instrumental experimentation (e.g. \\"Send Him Away\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\"), it is still very much a Franz Ferdinand recording.<br /><br />This has it's merits and drawbacks. The merits being catchy, hook driven melodic rock. Quirky lyrics. Indefatigable engergy. This is apparent all the way through the disc.<br /><br />On the other hand, the drawbacks, though few, heavily impede full enjoyment. My main issue with Franz Ferdinand is that all three of their cds sound almost identical. The band has not really changed much. It's arguable that they are quite repetitive. I can hear the attempts at change throughout \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" but it was not fully realized.<br /><br />\\"Ulysses\\" starts things of good enough, and this is followed by one of the best songs on the disc, \\"Turn It On\\" and \\"No You Girls\\". Things take a unique turn with \\"Send Him Away\\". It's this song where you can hear the band attempting something else, and it's good, but not quite the creative leap hoped for. \\"Twilight Omens\\" is probably the weakest track on the first half of the disc, followed by another solid track, \\"Bite Hard\\".<br /><br />\\"What She Came For\\" is rather irritating, followed by a cleverly written \\"Live Alone\\". \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\" is forgettable, and then comes the interesting eight minute experimentation that you will either love or hate. I actually liked it. The first half of \\"Lucid Dreams\\" is straightforward and then the second half is an instrumental passage that's trippy and hypnotic. This is followed by what appears to be a coda \\"Dream Again\\" or maybe a continuation of sorts. It's not as good as \\"Lucid Dreams\\". Then there's the Plain White T's ending \\"Katherine Kiss Me\\" with its amusing lyrics and acoustic guitar strumming.<br /><br />\\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" is a disc I wanted to like more than it actually turned out to be. Maybe next time the band will take greater artistic risks--I mean you can hear the band struggling here to really try something, but it just doesn't materialize, and instead you are give another round of the same old Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />Here's my comparison chart:<br /><br />2004 Franz Ferdinand: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 You Could Have It So Much Better: Three and a Half Stars<br />2009 Tonight: Franz Ferdinand: Three and a Half StarsTonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" is a disc I wanted to like more than it actually turned out to be.

Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.

After completing my first 20 minute workout I was completely whipped. Of curse it becomes a little easier the more you do it. I think that I will be ready to progress to level 2 by next week.  I already notice diffence in the way my clothes fit and the way I feel. This DVD is the real deal. Thanks Jillian!

B001L5SXQG|4.0|Springsteen has evolved into a commericial success (Super bowl) just as it seems most of the old rockers appear to do in the wanning of their career.  I may not have the true genius of Bruce in his early years of the everlasting \\"Born to Run\\" era, but what I see now is a recording wanting to be heard because of Bruce's seemingly \\"I think I have something to contribute but I'm not sure\\" attitude.  Bruce is still the \\"Boss\\" to me and I bought his album.  What more can I say?
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' voice is incredible.  I love this album.  The songs are lovely and calming, but just varied enough to be a fun treat to listen to.  I highly recommend this CD.  It is so pleasant and uplifting, and the voice is just amazing.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|I expected more more edginess from this recording.  It is certainly fairly good to listen to, but this is an American Idol formula; safe, predictable, non-radical attempt.  I am hopefull that Cook's next recording will have more originality and a real rocker edge to it.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This is an important work, and is defintely worth watching. Like \\"The Wire,\\" this miniseries demands attention and intelligence from the viewer to get the most out of it. It takes a couple of episodes to get to know the many characters, but it really pays off later on. It's unbelievable to me that so few films have been made about the Iraq War, but I'm glad that this is one of them.
B0017APPSE|4.0|The Other Boleyn Girl is not an accurate historical lesson.  It should not be viewed as fact.  It is, however, entertaining.  It has two beautiful women, an attractive man for them to fight over, and intrigue, manipulation, and power to spare.<br /><br />This movie is romantic and fanciful, and knowing what most people do about Henry VIII, it seems plausible.  It tells the story of Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fight over the love of Henry VIII, and although much of it is obviously fictionalized, it's trashy soap opera-y fun.<br /><br />It's a perfect Valentine's Day movie for couples to enjoy together!

1594200823|5.0|If you are what you eat, and you are, wouldn't you like to KNOW what you are made of and WHY? Spend a little time with Michael. You might want to know more; you might decide you don't want to know but I guarantee it'll be harder to blindly waddle into the sunset with the rest of America.
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|After \\"marinating\\" in this album for a week or so, I'd say that I feel this is his best album yet. It's quite a spiritual and emotional experience, and words cannot describe how much I'm loving this album right now!! If you're a fan of John and his music, BUY THIS ALBUM!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Great picture. Ordered one and the case was busted. Got a replacement shipped for free, but one of the discs didn't play at all. Shipping methods are substandard.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Great sound. Mixture of the old sound of the Bee Gees with a hint of a new direction they want to go. This album reveals their multiple talent in song writing. It's more acoustic than I want to hear but music wise, it's pure Bee Gees satisfaction.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|This movie is the best of the Bourne trilogy (which says a lot, since they're all great), and on HD-DVD it's even better. I have it on both DVD and HD-DVD, and the difference is huge on my 46\\" TV. This is one of the best action movies of the past 10 years without question.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This was suggested to us after the purchase of White Christmas. The story lines are a little similar, but definitely distinct enough. My wife actually likes it better than White Christmas, which has been the family favorite for years. DVD quality, packaging and picture were first rate. Highly recommended to expand your Christmas holiday collection.
B000P0J05G|5.0|This movie is amazing. The best not-horror movie of all time. And, since it's cheaper on HD-DVD than it is on DVD, it's a sweet deal. It looks a little better than the DVD version, but only if you have a big TV, but again, it's the same price. Can't go wrong.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|My reveiw of this movie is that if you love movies, especially science fiction, then definately buy this one.  Why?<br />  I know many people have probably written this about this movie, but it's true! 'Metropolis'  is a precurser for all the other great sci-fi movies that came after.  It has everything! A hero; a bad guy, romance, damsel in distress, and alot more.<br />  Yes, this is a silent movie, made in 1927, but this doesn't subtract from the mood or the message of the movie.  Also, the special effects for this movie was WAY before it's time.  Although this movie may not appeal to everyone, the serious movie buff will want to have this one in their library!
B000002GW5|5.0|Jackson Browne's Grammy-nominated life-on-tour documentary album,  [[ASIN:B0000262U9 Running on Empty]] (1977), is a unique and entertaining collection of previously unreleased songs that were recorded live on stage, backstage, on the tour bus and in hotel rooms during a concert tour in America. Everything is perfectly engineered and produced so that none of the recordings sound cheap or homemade. The onstage performances are lively and professional, and the offstage acoustic jams are engaging and authentic. You do get a documentary feel here of what it was like to tour with Jackson Browne in 1977.<br /><br />The title song, which was a hit single (#11), opens the album from the Merriweather Post Pavillion stage in Columbia, MD. It's an autobiographical rocker that chronicles Jackson's time on the road and how it has been a factor in his life. It's an energetic beginning, and the song perfectly sets the tone for [[ASIN:B0000262U9 Running on Empty]].<br /><br />Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels<br />I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels<br />I look around for the friends that I used to turn to, to pull me through<br />Looking into their eyes I see them running, too<br /><br />Other songs on [[ASIN:B0000262U9 Running on Empty]] also follow the album's life-on-the-road theme. The Road, Rosie, Shaky Town and The Load-Out are all about the touring life. There's a lonely sadness and uncertain regret in some of these songs, too, and sometimes it seems that even Jackson himself isn't really sure if he's living his dream or living in a dream. The first part of The Road was recorded in Room 301 at the Cross Keys Inn in Baltimore, MD and the second part onstage at the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ. Jackson sings:<br /><br />Blues in old motel rooms<br />Girls in daddy's car<br />You sing about the nights<br />You laugh about the scars<br /><br />It's an almost cruel irony that [[ASIN:B0000262U9 Running on Empty]] is Jackson Browne's best selling album. He is mostly famous for his outstanding songwriting talent, but on this album he only wrote two songs alone (Running On Empty, You Love The Thunder), and just contributed to five others. That really doesn't matter much because all of the songs here have the same world-weary and lovelorn tone that any Jackson Browne song might have, and they're a natural fit for him. On Love Needs A Heart, which he wrote with Valerie Carter and Lowell George, Browne sings:<br /><br />Love won't come near me, she don't even hear me<br />She walks past my vacancy sign<br />Love needs a heart, trusting and blind<br />I wish that heart was mine<br /><br />In the end, [[ASIN:B0000262U9 Running on Empty]] comes full circle and closes with another performance on the Merriweather Post Pavillion stage in Columbia, MD. This time it's the album's other hit single (#20), The Load-Out/Stay medley. It's over nine minutes long and features vocal performances by Browne, Rosemary Butler and David Lindley. Jackson sits alone at his piano and sings a tribute to the roadies, the audience and to life on the road during the Load-Out.<br /><br />But when that last guitar's been packed away<br />You know that I still want to play<br />So just make sure you got it all set to go<br />Before you come for my piano...ng songwriting talent, but on this album he only wrote two songs alone (Running On Empty, You Love The Thunder), and just contributed to five others.

B00005JLR2|4.0|Treasure Planet was a a movie I took with a grain of salt. It's not one of Disney's better known features, so I didn't expect much. At first, I thought the movie was going to live up to that idea, but once you get past its first half hour of awkward character introductions, it proves to be a fine entry to the Disney library. Beautiful animation and strong story prove to be one of Disney's better final attempts at classic animation.
0307341550|2.0|Unless you're interested in reading yet another book about a \\"damaged\\" heroine.  Someone who's tragic and scarred and traumatized by emotional/sexual hurts from childhood that dictate that she can't possibly live a halfway functional adult life.  I wanted so much to like Camille but her behavior (acting out in her 30s) ticked me off as did the attitudes of just about everyone in this quaint, little Missouri town.  What a toxic place!  No wonder the heroine is such a train wreck between the seething malice of everyone she encounters and her nut-job family (i.e. a thoroughly unbelievable, highly sexualized/manipulative 13-year old sister and a hateful, one-dimensional mother)!  Anyway, I did finish this book because I so wanted this novel to move past the abject hopelessness.  But, unfortunately, that never really happened.  I truly wanted Camille to have some redeeming qualities, but, ultimately, I couldn't connect with a grown woman who characterized a little girl as \\"the piggy middle child, who now waddled dazedly into the room, [who] was destined for needy sex and snack-cake bingeing.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've been hearing off and on over the years that Firefly is one of the best scifi shows ever. I'm always skeptical of the words \\"the best\\" but I figured I'll one day give it a shot. I saw Firefly on sale on Amazon for 20 bucks and decided I had nothing to lose, except for 20 some odd bucks for s&h. I hurt myself for not getting this show sooner.    Firefly consist of fourteen episodes, three of which were never aired on television. It's about Mal, and his crew of eight who takes on odd jobs. Each crew member is unique, however, and the show focuses on all nine characters at some point and time.    Here are the fourteen episodes that you get to see, and my thoughts on them:    Serenity Pilot - from my understanding, this was supposed to be the \\"pilot\\" episode of the series, but instead Tran Job got the pilot due to some management issues. Serenity is not to be confused with the movie, though. This is the only two hours episode you get in the whole Firefly series.    The Train Job - the actual pilot that was shown to people back when the show was on television. The episode features some interesting things about Simon and River, two of the interesting characters in the series.     Bushwhacked - I believe this is the first time you hear about Reavers which are really space pirates with a twist - they're insane, psychotic people who do some weird stuff to the people they capture.     Shindig - a pretty funny episode. I think this episode really shows off the \\"western\\" feel of the series because it features swordplay and so fort which is interesting to watch.    Safe - good episode depending on how you look at it. River and Simon got kidnapped by villagers and near the end, the village declares River as a witch and wants to burn her.    Our Mrs Reynolds - features Saffron who is Mal's nemesis in a later episode. Mal gets married, which the crew find funny, but the woman isn't exactly who she say she is. Features a fairly funny moment with Jayne and him trying to trade hisfavorite weapon for a wife, which he thinks is a fair and honest trade.    Jaynestown - there is a character named Jayne who is the crew's muscle. He's tough as nails, but he isn't exactly the brightest. Jayne comes to planet only to find that they think of him like some sort of urban legend. This episode I think highlights the series focus on multiple characters, and how detailed the creator makes each of them.    Out Of Gas - Definitely want to watch this sometime after seeing Serenity. This episode features some interesting back stories to how Mal got his crew together.    Ariel - another interesting Simon and River episode in that the crew attempts to \\"cure\\" River and her illness.    War Stories - this is one of my favorites. To understand this episode fully, you'd probably want to watch Train Job first. Although the ending of this episode got sort of rushed, I think it went pretty well for the 43 minutes.    Trash - You'd want to watch Our Mrs Reynolds first before watching this. I watched this episode before Our Mrs Reynolds and was a bit confused at first. However, you'll find this episode funnier if you watch the said episode first.    The Message - this is a strange episode. It's hated by many fans of the show because of its semi-weak story, however, interestingly it also explains a bit of back story between Mal and Zoe when they fought in a war for Independence, the losing side.    Heart Of Gold - throughout the series Mal and Inara have a sort of love-hate relationship. This episode sort of features a pretty cool link between the two.    Objects In Space - the last of the episodes, but interesting in that it again features Simon and River as the main story.    Those are all the episodes. That's it. It doesn't sound like much, but believe me, after watching all 14 episodes, you will probably fall in love with this show and probably want more. The first thought that came to mind was, \\"How did they decide to cancel this awesome show?\\" It's quite amazing andI'm quite baffled at how someone at a tv network could just drop this show.  After watching this, you'll no doubt want more. Well you don't have to worry. You'll find that there is a movie titled Serenity which is just as awesome as the show. On top of that there are comic books that explains the story before the movie Serenity.     Overall, the series is much loved by many people. I think any scifi fan should have Firefly in his or her collection. The show is simply awesome. There are many devoted fan sites as well, and the funny thing is that many fans are willing to donate cash so that they can create more episodes. The funnier thing is that I would be willing to pay into this fund if it means that there will be more episodes, that's how seriously you will become a fan if you see this show.
0060578793|5.0|This is without doubt the best investment i have ever made.  This book has everything a person would need to survive.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am an exercise junkie that usually relies on running and cycling to get my workout in. I googled Jillian Michaels to see if I can get any workout tips to liven up my usual routine and add some more muscle to my arms and abs and came across the 30 day shred dvd. I really never thought of cardio before but I took a chance and ordered the dvd since it was on sale. I am soooo glad I did. I exercise 5 days a week so I think of myself as pretty athletic. This dvd, on level 1, kicked my butt!  This is one of the best workouts and I couldn't believe how sore I was after day 1. If you're looking for a great workout, that's easy to follow but challenges you, pick this up NOW! You won't regret it. I am 3 workouts in and I can tell you this has given me greater endurance that I'm noticing during my cycling and running workouts.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I remember when this came out.  Bill was on \\"GMA\\" & did the weather.    Funny, original film.  You wish comedies were ALL like this.     Bill did a great job as Phil.  All the things he did in the film as February 2 kept repeating.    Harold in his bit part as the doctor.  Another cameo by Willie Garson  (Stanford from Sex & the City, There's Something About Mary).     Decent extras on the DVD.    BUT, an anniversary edition?  Needed more.  Like.........   NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM.  The film was a hit & this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?    I did NOT care for the artwork on the front.
141690977X|5.0|Just like my title says, this is the book that every house with a female inside must have. I have bought it, for me, and for my best friend. And after reading it, our opinion about this book was: \\"this is the first thing that my daughter will hear or read in her life\\". I only wish that this book came to my life sooner, than I would spend less time about thinking why or how come, and more time having fun and meeting guys that are actually So into me :)
0316017922|3.0|I enjoyed Gladwell's first two books, & enjoyed \\"Outliers\\" as well -- he has a clear & easy-to-read writing style & an ability to find & describe interesting human interest type stories, as well as scientific research. By \\"Outliers\\" Gladwell means people who have been abnormally successful. This book is meant to be literally inspirational -- Gladwell wants the book to inspire people to create the circumstances in which people, especially young people, have opportunities to become unusually successful. An important theme is K. Anders Ericsson's \\"10,000 Hour Rule\\" -- which states that most fields of endeavor require about 10,000 hours of \\"deliberate practice\\" to master. Parents, educators, & others are encouraged to set up conditions under which young, motivated people will be able to practice this much. So far so good but there are serious problems.    In order to inspire people to nurture talent, Gladwell unscientifically exaggerates the role of nurture, and downplays that of nature. He acknowledges that analytical intelligence (\\"intelligence\\") -- the type of intelligence measured by IQ tests -- has a significantly hereditary component. This is not inspiring, and Gladwell correctly states that a certain level of intelligence (often an IQ of about 120) may be necessary for many types of success but it is not sufficient. He then erroneously states, suggests and implies that the necessary personality characteristics, unlike IQ, do NOT have a significant hereditary component. And this is the main problem with the book.    In the Trouble With Geniuses chapter, Gladwell describes Chris Langan, an IQ genius who failed to graduate from college or publish his life-work book, & worked for much of his life as a nightclub bouncer. Gladwell concludes:    \\"IQ is a measure, to some degree, of innate ability. (Most estimates put the heritability of IQ at roughly 50 percent.) But social savvy is KNOWLEDGE. It's a set of skills that have to be learned. It has to come from somewhere,and the place where we seem to get these kinds of attitude and skills is from our families.\\"    Yet Langan's failure in the academic world, as described by Gladwell, was largely due to his lack of two qualities -- \\"agreeability\\" & \\"conscientiousness\\" -- that, just like IQ, appear to be significantly hereditary. The same studies (on twins, adoptees, etc) that show that IQ is significantly heritable, show that these other traits are as well, yet Gladwell accepts the former and acts as if he's never heard of the latter.    And he does this over & over again. As Judith Rich Harris has repeatedly pointed out (and, ironically, Gladwell prominently promoted Harris's work), conscientious (etc) parents will try to teach their biological children to act in conscientious (etc) ways but this fact does NOT tell you whether the teaching or the biology caused the quality to be passed on to their children. To untangle nature & nurture you have to compare adopted children w/ their biological vs adoptive parents. And when you do this, biological children resemble their biological parents, not their adoptive parents (though adoptive parents can damage children through overt abuse).    Later in the book, Gladwell's twist on the theme is \\"culture.\\" For example, white people in the US South have different biochemical reactions to insults. Gladwell suggests that this is due to their having inherited the culture of their northern Britain herding ancestors. But, of course, white southerners also inherited their ancestors' genes. Which caused the behavioral & biochemical differences? Gladwell says it's not the genes, again, without providing any evidence.    Still, well-written & thought-provoking.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film.  At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that.  It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.  Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story.  If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well.
0131103628|5.0|I started to read about this famous K&R after I already have some programming experience. Beginner programmers often get lost in the syntax and language details. In the eyes of a more experienced programmer, what really matters is what the authors think about what programming is. This lovely volume does not simply teaches the language at the syntax level. It shows what the language is like in the hands of the true masters. Time and again when I pick up this book, it never fails to make me smile.    In the application programming realm, where absolute performance is not critical and design and clarity is king, writing up a good piece of program is like writing an enjoyable article--it is all about expressing one's self and well, so that it is simple, clear and very much elegant.  This small book is a good example to that end.    I truly believe that programmers at all levels should continue to read a lot about programming itself. And at one point, you are able to distinguish very good writings to the average ones and are able to point out what you do not like about what the authors are preaching, you are now, in my opinion, in the next level.
B001K98MFU|4.0|Great movie if you're a fan of the genre. The blu-ray doesn't disappoint. Great sound and picture. The over-dub is excellent for those of you who get sick of reading subtitles, since the ghost in the shell series talk about a lot of information in a quick manner. Good movie.

0345495004|5.0|This book has so many different facets that have kept me thinking about it every day since I finished reading it. On one level is the topic of architecture.  I have never had any particular interest in that other than to appreciate looking at beautiful buildings; I have lived within an hour of Spring Green, Wisconsin, for 28 years, have been there many times, and have never visited Taliesen. Now I can't wait to go there, and to also seek out other buildings that were designed by Wright.  I feel that the author was able to communicate the architect's reasons for designing structures the way he did, as well as his passion for his art. I was also shocked to learn that I had never known about the history regarding the events that took place at Taliesen over the years. Even more shocking, none of my \\"native Wisconsin\\" friends knew of these events, either.    On a completely different level are the moral and philosophical issues that are raised by the actions of the various characters.  Definitely food for thought and reflection, and certainly fodder for many a discussion among fellow readers of the novel.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Our current education system has evidently not required the current batch of Troy watchers to have actually read Homer, but if they had, I am sure they would have agreed that this is some Hollywood writers wet dream - and I mean that in the worst possible sense.    While the photography, scenes and imagery are pretty good, the plot is absolutely criminal.    What an accurate reflection of our total lack of an educational system in the U.S.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|It's not that this is a bad or even mediocre movie. It's actually a pretty good movie in a lot of ways. It's beautifully shot, nicely written and directed. There are some good performances. But it's also  Woody Allen at his most cynical. As he did nearly three decades ago with \\"Interiors,\\" Allen gives us a world in which happiness is impossible and love is a cruel little joke played on the upper crust. Every character here, you see, is some combination of beautiful, wealthy, educated, artistically gifted and entitled. The fact that they have lifestyles and assets we only dream about does make them a bit annoying when they wallow in their discontent. Honestly, it's just hard to work up much sympathy for someone who looks like Scarlett Johansson and gets to spend her summers vacationing in Barcelona when the sum of her problems seems to be, well, she doesn't quite know what she wants in a boyfriend. In this movie, not only do money and beauty not buy love, but love is unreal anyway. So, yes, it's a good movie in a sense. But, as with the characters themselves, it just ain't all that likable.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Absolutely besotted by this second album and its lush impact. If the initial outing deservedly gained wide recognition of a prodigious and eclectic talent, this work will gain even greater afflatus.

More please!
B000UX6THK|3.0|When \\"Twin Peaks\\" was originally aired, I had no idea who David Lynch was, and assumed that the serial was just another boring US detective or cop serial.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />I watched episode 9, saw the giant, and was hooked. Naturally!<br /><br />When one of the Swedish cable channels re-run the series, they did it (perhaps on purpose) one hour pass midnight. I was sitting in the dark, with the television on a low volume, and watched the bizarre episodes. It was almost a spiritual experience. The music was very much part of it, too. Of course, I was disappointed by the incomprehensible last episode. Poor Leo.<br /><br />I remember that my brother really hated Dr. Jacoby and his red-green Hawaiian specs. I also remember that his girlfriend wore an FBI jacket, just as Agent Cooper! Also, some joker in our neighbourhood spray-painted the following spoiler on the local junior high school: \\"LAURA'S FATHER DID IT\\". My father didn't get the occult aspect, and steadfastly maintained that Leland was the killer, and that Bob was a fictitious entity. Most Swedes stopped watching the series long before the murderer was revealed. It was just too strange.<br /><br />Finally, I remember speculating about David Lynch's in-house jokes. Sherilyn Fenn (Audrey Horne) stars in both \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"Wild at Heart\\". In \\"Wild at Heart\\", she has crashed a red corvette. In \\"Twin Peaks\\", Leo owns a red corvette. Sherilyn Fenn was rumoured to be the girlfriend of the singer Prince, who has recorded a song called \\"Little Red Corvette\\". Also, Fenn and her new boyfriend Johnny Depp supposedly owned a red corvette. Bingo! And what about Kyle MacLachlan, who stars an FBI agent from Seattle in both \\"Twin Peaks\\" and \\"The Hidden\\"? In both productions, he chases a supernatural killer! Hmmm...<br /><br />In hindsight, I must admit that I'm less pleased with \\"Twin Peaks\\". Much of the bizarre stuff which struck me as great fun as a young adult, isn't so funny any more. Often, \\"Twin Peaks\\" comes across as a comic show. But what's so funny about the sadistic rape and murder of a teenage girl, anyway? Or about child abuse or brothels? It's the contrast between the grizzly realities and the comic aspect that I can't really stand any more. Perhaps I'm more mature...<br /><br />But no, I don't want to ban the show or anything like that. Besides, there are even worse forms of entertainment than watching \\"Twin Peaks\\". If you like strange plot developments, constant references to the occult, and have a really weird sense of humour, you will probably like the series. Personally, I will stick to \\"Lost\\" for the time being!o funny about the sadistic rape and murder of a teenage girl, anyway? Or about child abuse or brothels?

0385340990|4.0|Like most of Amazon readers who thoroughly enjoyed this book, I read it in one sitting and could not put it down.  At first I wasn't sure I could get into the epistolary writing style, as well as the silly title.  Then I found it strange that our protagonist, Juliet, was striking up such a friendly correspondance with strangers.  Also, I wasn't sure I would enjoy the WWII theme.  But I was wrong about all of that, and became hypnotized by the development of characters living on the island of Guernsey who had formed a reading group as a way of coping with the Nazi occupation: Juliet's gay literary agent, the young girl who adopts herself into Juliet's home, the romantic and the anti-romantic, and the farmer who becomes a love interest. The epistolary style actually works so well in this novel because the characters come through in such a true way...I had no trouble keeping track of who was who.
B001R3ZA4U|1.0|I've loved/hated Smallville for years.  It's the one show that's always had me locked in on hope alone, never because they delivered the goods.  Such potential, always squandered.  This season, I thought it'd be different.  And, up to the \\"Legion\\" episode, it was.  Literally, a fanboy's dream season.  But, \\"Power\\" is the SINGLE WORST EPISODE OF ANY SHOW EVER FILMED ON ANY NETWORK OR PUBLIC ACCESS CHANNEL.  HTF did this get greenlighted?  I wanted to cancel my season pass after watching this!  I wanted to smash my laptop against the wall to exact vengeance for this...mindrape of a tv show!  This episode is disgusting, to say the least.  It's convinced me of one thing that 7 years of mediocrity couldn't: this show must end this season.  No more chances.  End it, before you make me hate Superman forever.
0670020478|2.0|While it was a good read, I was disappointed that it talks mainly about how wonderful it is to find out what your own element is (being in the zone)but offers little in how to go about finding what the element is for each individual. I finished this book wanting more information. It seemed the author wasn't quite finished when the book ended.
B001PS7JH8|5.0|MAY BE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED:  \\"Legion\\" is written by Geoff Johns, easily one of the best Superman writers ever.  The proof is here.  Shortly, Johns does in one episode what few writers manage to do in entire story arcs: prove Superman/Clark right.  Clark doesn't just refuse to kill.  He FINDS ANOTHER WAY.  That's the essence of Superman. Dumb luck doesn't present him a way out--he USES HIS BRAIN!  I didn't know from previous seasons that Clark even had one! For the first time in this series, there's some indication that Clark may not actually be super-retarded. With all the power at his disposal to easily eliminate any and all enemies, his refusal to kill sets him apart from so many others.  He devises the method with which they defeat Brainiac.  This is the same guy who has risked destroying the entire world because he didn't listen to his remarkably unfather-like father (who actively seemed to hate him), when he tried to tell him, \\"If you don't do what I say, the world's gonna die!\\"  Well, watch the episode.  Buy it.  It's worth the price of the season in my book.
B001AMVN3U|3.0|When I first heard the opener, my expectations skyrocketed. I suppose I should have known better (The Offspring have good opening tracks on every one of their albums -- excluding Splinter). Since my issue with this album (and frankly with this band) is misappropriated expectations, it's applicable. It's a matter of consistency and a matter of misrepresentation.     I grew up listening to The Offspring, and I always loved the way they have remained more-or-less genre-less (while understandably punk-centered) -- even if their acceptance into the mainstream has removed the more appealing blends. The sound that I loved then and love now is an edgy, punk verse leading to a powerful yet melodic chorus (with oozin ah's emerging from beneath the surface). Bad Religion comes to mind. The first five tracks of this album follow this pattern very well. As hinted, Half-Truism is one of the best new-wave punk songs I've heard in a while (Dexter almost croons). What follows is a great song with a great chorus (sounds very similar to Smash's title track). You're Gonna Go Far, Kid definitely grew on me, as did Hammerhead, and Takes Me Nowhere sounds enough like Trust in You to garner my support. But, as other reviewers have come close to expressing, this album climbs and climbs, and then drops. To use an expression used by the penultimate song, it hits rock-bottom.     As a listener, I am confused because I hear great and awful music coming from the same source. If The Offspring are capable of writing songs like Trust in You, why are they writing songs like Rise and Fall and Fix You? As a band, they are fickle with their \\"sound\\". (And while people may feel closed-minded for admitting it, every band needs a consistent sound. Musicians that break musical barriers still follow somewhat consistent musical patterns.)    To sum it up, it redeems the band of Splinter and a lot of Conspiracy of One, an album which I would probably give a critique similar to the one I'm giving here; but it'snot groundbreaking or amazing in general. I find myself ignoring the last half, and that doesn't sit right with me.
B001RTIHPS|1.0|Two in a row.  Two of the worst Smallville--no, two of the worst episodes of any show (and I watched G vs E, as well as Forever Knight) written by high school graduates.  I've been a Superman fan since I was 3 and my father took me to my first movie (Superman, of course).  Smallville has always teased me and other fanboys with its potential, but never delivered. Horrible acting, writing, overall plot execution, terrible continuity, and general disdain for its fans with I.Q.'s above 75.  This season was so different.  The first 11 episodes were the best of the entire series.  A fanboy's dream come true.  In 2 episodes, they've taken me from passive disappointment to active hatred.  The only way I'll support a season 9 is if they \\"Newhart\\" these 2 episodes.  Clark wakes up in the next episode, and says \\"What a horrible dream!  Man, I'd have to be on kryptonite crack to write something that bad!\\" Later...Oliver: \\"What happened to Lana?\\" Clark: \\"Who?\\"  OLIVER: \\"Lana?  Your girlfriend...sorta?  You know, the one who has retarded superpowers and is now running around the world doing...probably nothing more important than whining and manipulating men into doing things for her because she's either too lazy or selfish to do it herself? Hopefully, her powers played out in the desert, and she never found her way out, cause I was really sick of having her around; but, I digress...Oh, by the way, I killed Lex's stand-in.  I think.\\" CLARK:\\"No, really, Oliver, I have no idea wtf you're talking about.  Have you been hitting the pipe?\\" Yeah.  Then I'd watch a season 9.  Maybe even buy the pass.
0810970686|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is the third book in the Wimpy Kid series. If you are unaware, the series is told from the point of view of middle schooler Greg Heffley. He begins keeping a diary after his mom buys him a blank one, and the book is written in this format, with text that looks like handwriting and doodled illustrations. The plot consists of Greg getting himself into stupid situations, then trying to take the easy way out, usually getting him into more trouble.    Last Straw begins with a new year. Greg starts thinking about resolutions, but comes to the conclusion that he is the best person he knows and therefore doesn't need to make any resolutions. Instead, he makes them for the other members of his family. One example of this is that he decides that his mom needs to make less noise when she chews her potato chips.    The book continues with other hilarious endeavors. For example, Greg tries playing soccer, with disastrous results. Later in the book, Greg's dad sees what military school has done to a teenage former nemesis of his, and decides that it would be great for Greg, so Greg has to work to thwart this plan. Other things that made me laugh out loud (without giving away too much) involve a well-known children's author and a bingo game full of old ladies.    Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw was highly enjoyable to read, and is also enjoyable for kids. The humor is much more sophisticated that books like Captain Underpants because while Greg's situations are often ridiculous, they are also grounded in reality and do not just rely on toilet humor. The simple stick figure like drawings also add a lot to the story. This book is another success in the series, and I anticipate Wimpy Kid #4.
0446401307|5.0|I've read all of Michael Connelly's novels and to me he just gets better each time out. If I could go back and re-rate all my previous reviews I'd give them all 5 stars. I've realized all his books are highly enjoyable and that all the other authors I've been exposed to who write this kind of crime-fiction don't come close. There's many I can't finish.<br /><br />In the \\"Overlook\\" I really did feel I knew who the killer was early on, and it didn't bother me I was right at the end. I wonder if Connelly wanted it that way?<br /><br />I keep wondering who should play Harry in a movie??? Maybe Tommy Lee Jones. Linda Fiorentino as Rachel Walling. C'mon Hollywood!
0439023483|4.0|If you enjoyed the Twilight and Harry Potter series, you'll love this book. Suzanne Collins has a great imagination and she ran with it. I want Cinna, who is Katniss' stylist for the Games, to do my makeup and costume for my next New Year's Party. Having made that shallow statement, I'll add that besides letting you enjoy the fun of fantasy, she also makes you think about the impacts of war on our world and our young people.  Can't wait for the sequel.....and a movie!
B001EO748M|5.0|Hot Series - Tudors season 2 (like season 1) is loaded with good sets, greats costumes and superb acting by the players.  A little less hot/steamy than season 1, but non the less a good ride and story follow through.  The Tudors 1 and 2 are a must see!
B00007KWHG|5.0|Purchased this CD after seeing Jersey Boys and decided to get the \\"real thing\\" rather than the musical sound track.  ALL the hits are here and it is hard not to start singing along with all the tracks!  Great value and great sound.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|In a post Twilight 2008, a movie I didn't see because I have my pride, Låt den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In) became available to me. I didn't know much about this movie, I knew the book, but I never expected anything great. But wow, there is now waay to explain how you feel after you see this movie. The day after I saw it I woke up still thinking about it. The romance, friendship, and anger in every scene is palpable. If you haven't seen this, buy it! If you have, than that's why you're here. It's not a vampire movie, it's human nature at it's cruelest and most flawed, which is as perfect as it gets.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|I don't consider myself a hardcore fan, but I've been listening to them since my days in college over a decade ago. This album has a different twist, less hard angst, and less politics. That said, I still like this album a lot. I've been listening from beginning to end and I am amazed that I like some of the slower songs like Kristy, are you doing okay and fix you. Maybe I can related 'cuz I've grown up and so has the band. Other songs that I like include Stuff is messed up, Half-Truism and Let's hear it for rock bottom.
1592402690|5.0|HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE is an insider's account of the recording of many of the Beatles' albums. The book is 387 pages. It contains no photographs, aside from a black and white photo of the Fab Four on the front cover, a two very tiny photos of the author. The book encompasses events taking place from 1966 until the early 1970s, where the author worked with Paul McCartney's band, Wings. Towards the end of the book, there is some information on events in the 1990s and the early 2000s.     FACTS ABOUT SPECIFIC SONGS     We learn that \\"I buried Paul,\\" as found at the end of Strawberry Fields, is actually John Lennon saying, \\"cranberry sauce\\" (page 141). We learn that, for Paperback Writer, the microphone used for recording the bass guitar was actually a loudspeaker (page 115), we learn about Ringo's straining to stay on pitch (page 118), we learn that Paul (not George Harrison) played the lead guitar on Good Morning and on Taxman (pages 127, 177), we learn about Ringo's squeaking shoe at the very of Day in the Life (page 161) (I confirmed this, you can hear Ringo shifting weight and his squeaking shoe), we learn that the brass band on Yellow Submarine was actually from a spliced tape of pre-existing recordings of a brass band--cut up, randomized, and spliced back. And we learn that the instrumentation on Mr.Kite was glockenspiel, organ, bass harmonica, and calliope.     NOVEL MUSICAL TERMS.     We learn about novel musical terms, terms not found in classical music. When I'm 64 was described as \\"rootie-tootie\\" (page 137). The strings of Eleanor Rigby are described as \\"biting\\" (page 127). Strawberry Fields is described as needing to sound \\"heavier\\" (page 138). The singing in Day in the Life is described as, \\"he wanted his voice to sound all muzzy\\" (page 152). A piano kept out of tune is described as honky-tonky (page 161).\\" These terms bring to mind a similar term used by the Grateful Dead for describing one of their early albums, namely, a multi-tracked sound characterized as \\"thick air.\\"     TECHNICAL ASPECTS     We learn of many technical aspects used in making the Beatles' recordings. We learn about staggering overdubs (page 160), running the vocal through a Leslie (page 111), click tracks (page 142), recording each instrument individually rather than as an ensemble, to achieve an \\"American sound\\" (page 142), extremely close miking (page 127), limiters (pages 128, 178), varispeed (pages 188, 139), EQ adjustments (pages 176, 170, 191), Automatic Double Tracking (pages 170, 177, 178), bifurcate, splange, and loop (page 188), multi-track reductions (pages 143, 191), Mellotron (135, 136), cutting 2 tapes at a very shallow angle and splicing them together (page 140), pronouncing d's and t's to trigger tape echo (page 147), Direct Inject (DI box) (pages 115, 151). We learn about removing the erase head of a tape recorder to make multiple tracks (page 111). And we read about tape loops (pages 111-113). The occasional commentary on these technical aspects goes a long way to make the narrative more interesting and substantial. Obviously, the book is not pop-star fluff.     BRITISH EXPRESSIONS     The book is made more interesting by the author's use of various British expressions. For example, we learn about a food called, \\"crisps\\" (page 121), we learn \\"off to have a cuppa\\" means off to have a cup of tea (page 116), we read that \\"the drums sound a bit naff\\" (page 175), we read the term \\"sod,\\" as in \\"sod the cost\\" (page 154), we read, \\"I'm knackered\\" meaning that I'm tired (pages 182, 186), we read that John Lennon had a \\"bee in his bonnet\\" (page 177), and we learn that somebody was \\"quite chuffed\\" (page 187). These occasional British expressions make the book more interesting, and convince us that the book was not written by some American interested in earning a quick buck by tossing together a book about the Fab Four.     CONCLUSION. The book is well-written and can be completed in three sittings. The author refrains from delving into historical events that can be found in newspapers. The author refrains from delving into pop-sociology fluff, and does not decorate the writing with literary excesses. The author does not distract the reader with extensive commentary on the pop-culture at the time. The book sticks to the topic of issues relating to the recording process. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any person kept a detailed daily diary of conversations as they occurred. It is unlikely that any person on earth had realized that the Beatles would still be the world's most important rock'n'roll band some 50 years after the fact, or even that this would likely be the case some 500 years after the fact. Hence, the book is not as detailed as one might wish. FIVE STARS.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|My title pretty much says it all. I love the design of keypad despite its awkward appearance. The keys were surprisingly easy to reach although very stiff.    The joystick is just a poorly designed mess. First of all, its overly sensitive. In alot of games, I tend to overrotate. In addition, the software currently has only 4 directs to the joystick, so if you play a game where you program a strafe diagonally, forget it.    Lastly, the two side buttons adjacent to the joystick, feels awkward because of the joystick. On the Nostromo, you can quickly tap the tab button and instantaneously go back to the joystick without missing a beat. Not so with the G13. Because the head of the joystick is so small, I spent alot of time fumbling to get my thumb back to the joystick head.      Overall, its a good device, keys are nicely set up, built well but its just not made for games where you need fast reaction time. In that regards, I switch to my N52TE.

0732257441|5.0|I'm a huge fantasy/science fiction novel fan and I must say, this book is the most imaginative I've come across.  Everything little detail in this book was so original.  I have no bad comments for this book other than to say that it was too short.  I feel that the protagonist's journey should be longer, maybe make it into a series. The characters are likable and complex, the storyline is simple, the villain is purely evil. The first time I read this book was when I was 15, and read it again now that I'm in college and I still think this is a great read.  I definetly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be taken away into a world so different from ours but don't have the cliche of dragons, knights, or wizards.
B000O76TA4|4.0|this is not a chick-flick. although the women do enjoy brad pitt in this movie. overall this is a cool movie, it makes you wonder if this could happen to you. fight club is a movie i think should be in your dvd collection.

076535618X|4.0|I've just finished reading `The Last Colony` by John Scalzi and although it's very early in the year I can honestly say this is going to be one of the best reads of 2009. John Perry, the hero of John Scalzi's Hugo-nominated debut novel, Old Man's War, has found peace in a violent universe. When him and his wife, Jane, are asked to lead a new colony world, he jumps at the chance to explore the universe. Him and his new colony are pawns in an interstellar game of diplomacy and war between humanity's Colonial Union and a new, seemingly unstoppable alien alliance that has ordered an end to all human colonization.<br /><br />This is a great read. Scalzi characters are believable, his plots are adventurous and engaging without running the risk of being primarily action-driven.  What Scalzi also achieves to make the world of Roanoke, the last colony in the novel, truly shine is the level of detail. He presents the planet as a microcosm in a larger geo-political empire.  Scalzi's novel reads simple on the surface but what you take away from the novel is something more complex. What he also achieves is showing the reader the grand scale of galactic empires without reading like some of the daunting space opera epics (i.e. Alaistar Reynolds, Ian M. Banks).  If you're a seasoned science fiction aficionado or just want an enjoyable read.  This is the book for you!<br /><br />[...]
B001L5SXQG|1.0|I have almost 10K worth of hif and this album is a dog, so much so you cannot listen to it, so muddy and lifeless, Bruce needs to let someone else produce as there are really some nice tunes deep within the mud just waiting to get out from the \\"wall of sound\\"?

B001KVZ6NY|5.0|I am really glad I bought this book.  I am a Marine that has a lot of different responsibilities.  It is short and to the point.  I gave it a five because I read it daily in Afghan.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I was thrilled to see that a complete DVD series came out for my favorite Star Trek series. At a reasonable price considering the cost of seasons and series sets, I of course bought it. I do have a few complaints with it though. The packaging is terrible and I ended up moving all 49 discs to a different container. The giant bulky green cube comes in three parts but you have to take the whole thing out and then flip through each section. Plus the container is made of what seems to be thin and brittle plastic so I was always afraid of breaking it.   When you put the DVD in, the menu screens are cute and Star Trek TNG themed but somewhat confusing and I've run into issues with certain DVDs not working, Luckily nothing permanent, just a few glitches here and there. Plus I find they're numbered oddly...Beyond that this is a fabulous series and the value of a relatively affordable collection of it plus commentary should not be overlooked. I've never seen any other comprehensive series sets like this in person so I can't say whether they'd be a marked improvement over this collection. In short, buy it for the DVDs not the whole package.
B00005O084|2.0|Robert Downey Jr. earned an Oscar nomination for his brilliantly detailed incarnation of Sir Charles Chaplin (1889-1977). Unfortunately, \\"Chaplin\\" (1993) comes off as a horribly clich&eacute;d Hollywood biopic. Director Richard Attenborough utilizes a clumsy script that emphasizes the tabloid aspects of Chaplin's personal life rather than his cinematic achievements. The film's historical inaccuracies and omissions are cringeworthy. Among the bloopers: Charlie's dinner-party snub of J. Edgar Hoover leads to a long-running FBI investigation; a few audience members yell \\"Communist!\\" during the final speech in \\"The Great Dictator\\"; and the controversial \\"Monsieur Verdoux\\" simply does not exist. Worse still, Attenborough makes the disastrous error of incorporating a fictitious biographer (played by Anthony Hopkins) to justify the contrived flashback structure - then admits this deceit in the closing credits. On a positive note, Geraldine Chaplin delivers a moving portrayal as her own grandmother while Sven Nykvist's cinematography captures the nostalgic glow of Early Hollywood. \\"Chaplin\\" is worth a look for Downey's remarkable performance, which stands in stark contrast to Attenborough's misguided approach.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent Series. The hi-def graphic images of the films just take the breath away. A must see for any nature or earth lover.
0575081406|5.0|If you enjoy well-written and creative fantasy writing, this is the book for you. Don't be intimidated by its size (at over 600 pages, this book is no light weight) because this book will take you for a ride. The hallmark of a good book is your inability to put it down, and this book didn't leave my hands for very long. Patrick Rothfuss introduces rich characters and creative fantasy world, which I enjoyed tremendously. It is a debut that stands out for its quality and originality. I look forward to the remaining two books in the trilogy.
B001DHXT2A|5.0|We are 100% satisfied with this purchase.  We have watched the film several times.  Item was shipped timely, without damage.  We recommend purchase for your collection.
B0012Z361C|5.0|Beautiful location in his home area, lots of high quality talent for support - excellent piano solo by Lang Lang, competition between Andrea and Chris Botti to see who could carry last note of song the longest (I'll let you watch it to see who won, but it took a while to see), Sarah Brightman doing wonderful duet with him of \\"Canto Della Terra\\", it really made me wish I was there! Best concert yet I have seen of Andrea Bocelli!
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and all of the Twilight series books. I so can't wait to see the movies now!! This collection will reside next to another one of my very special book collections, the Harry Potter book series. I will enjoy rereading the Twilight series of books for years to come!
B001MW0J2O|3.0|I've liked Animal Collective for maybe 5 years or so, and I see a lot of people are digging this new album. It's very well put together, and definitely it is strong in the melody department. I don't know how long this album will last on me though. I'm already kind of sick of My Girls in a certain way, although part of me still likes how repetative and simple it is. I think this album is produced and mixed well, perhaps a little sugary/glossy though. The keyboard/drum/bass sounds on this album are not all that unique, but the way they use them so interestingly and tastefully in the songs is a development in creative pop music, to me anyway. Sometimes the singing, whether it be panda bear or avey tear, kinda gets old to me, though. I think they are extremely talented and creative, i guess it's just a taste thing. People do over hype things in my view, but I understand why young people do like this album so much. It seems fresh, genuine, and well made. I have mixed feelings about Animal Collective. Feels is probably my favorite album of theirs. Perhaps I'm just in a different phase of life or something, but I prefer the deeper aspects of pop albums like Bjork's Vespertine, or Flaming Lips' Soft Bulletin.
0143038419|4.0|Ms. Gilbert's book was a wonderful, funny adventure.  Even though I didn't always identify with the author I always found her to be sincere -- I drooled over the Italian part, yoga was okay...only the love affair part seemed to be handled with a too-light touch.  Still, its a great read.  In its tone it reminded me of Love from Both Sides, by Stephanie Risely which gives a far, far more detailed, complex and moving love story.  If you like \\"Eat\\" you'll like Love From Both Sides even more.
B001QD7SF0|1.0|Nothing I would listen to. He is getting very old. Last two albums have been very disappointing. May be time for him to retire! But I was never a big fan anyway.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|On rare occasions, I watch movies like these. Since I got this for my mom for her Valentine's Day present, I watched it with her. It does have a good storyline, awesome actors, and very funny moments, like driving around town trying to find a drug store that has condoms. Sarah is divorced and lonely, so is Jake. They meet at the dog park because Sarah's sister, Carol put an ad on PerfectMatch.com for her. The ad says that you 'must love dogs' During the film, they fall in love. I love when they show Sarah's disastrous dates, including Lenny who is always crying. I love that you can see HALLOWEEN decorations, and much more. I highly recommend MUST LOVE DOGS!!!
B001GCUNVW|4.0|Randy \\"the Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a wrestler who has continued to soldier on well past his prime, suffers a heart attack.  His doctor tells him he must retire, so this lonely man, who has burned all his bridges and lives a marginal existence, must put together some kind of life outside the ring.    Rourke's amazing performance is the main draw in a film that is otherwise slightly overrated.  Another strong aspect is the gritty, closely observed backstage milieu of the second string wrestling circuit where fading stars and rising rookies battle it out in seedy gyms and American Legion halls before small audiences.  Although the competition is fake, the activity is real and the athletes take a tremendous beating.  Rourke is absolutely believable both inside and outside the ring.      The female supporting roles don't fare as well.  Marisa Tomei is a wonderful performer, but the stripper with a heart of gold is a bit cliché.  In her scenes as Randy's estranged daughter, Evan Rachel Wood fails to add depth to a shallowly conceived character, coming across as shrill and irritable.  Nevertheless, Randy the Ram and the world he inhabits stayed with me long after the film was over.
0735619670|5.0|Buy a stack of these books and put them on your desk to give away like candy to any software developers who wander in. It's the best thing you could do for your company and its products. In my opinion, this is simply the best book ever written for software developers. If you write software, no matter where your skill or experience level is at using the gems gleamed from this book will make you a better programmer. I have read this book, cover-to-cover a total of 3 times since it was originally published and each time I get something more/different from it. While most of tips seem obvious in retrospect, most things in there seem to escape the practice of most programmers. The style of the writing and layout of the graphical icons in the margins of book make it fun to read and all the hard data helps to drive each point/tip home....No professional programmer should be without this book!
B000XUUQQK|1.0|First off, it is best to note that this movie is not a continuation of the original Boogeyman.  In fact, the only thing the two movies share in common is the title.    The best way to describe the film is: dress a man up in a boogeyman costume, mix it with any of the Saw films, and viola, Boogeyman 2.    Hope this helps in your decision.
B000ZN802W|4.0|I very mcuh enjoyed this film! Follow the wonderful adventure of an idealistic young man as he grapples with the truth behind modern life and unversal values.    An original thinker he rejects the tradtional mould to make up his own mind about the meaning of existence. Either bravely or foolishly wandering America.    Allows us each to make our own value judgements about important issues which touch all our lives such as we follow his travels. Ultimately comming to conclusions about the value of people and relationships in our lives. A great film for the adolescent.    Tragic and moving. Great acting. Excellently filmed and delicately handled by the filmaker.This work both believable and inspiring..    Best regards.

0060254920|5.0|This is one of my fav books.  I remember reading it as a child and just bought it for my sons 2nd birthday!  He likes it!  Its a timeless story!
B0000TB050|5.0|I had my doubts about buying this DVD one day and expecting it to be delivered the next, as requested, but, it happened.  We could not have been happier with the service and the product that we received.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is a great Christmas \\"must have\\" movie,along with the regulars like Bells of St. Mary's, Miracle on 34th Street, Holiday Inn,and It's a Wonderful Life. These are movies we watch every year, starting on Thanksgiving Day.We also include March of The Wooden Soldiers. Christmas wouldn't be the same without all of these in our house.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Animal Collective - Merriweather Post Pavillion (2009)<br /><br />This album is so trippy! You can totally wig out on it. The kind of thing you can practically get high on without the drugs. I've heard some pretty interesting songs from these guys but this album is better than anything else I've heard from them. If yer into \\"psych rock\\" or whatever you wanna label it, this is some of the best I've heard in a while. Truthfully, I'm not much of a Beach Boys fan and you can definitely hear that band's influence in this music, but Animal Collective take those dreamy melodies to much cooler places (IMHO).
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is my favorite drama series of all time. Not only is it entertaining, but also informatative as it shows you a little about how the executive office of our government works.
0345479092|4.0|Great book.it really helped me understand my baby's cues and loved the fact that its principles are common sense.Also it saves you from guessing what your baby needs with all the detailed descriptions of baby's signals.  I definitely recommend it. It's an eye-opener even for a second-time mom like me
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Righteous Kill is an excellent movie.  It was a action and drama all in one.  Any one who enjoys these two combinations, would really enjoy this movie.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This is a strange movie that blends sci-fi with Salvador Dali atmoshere.  It draws the viewer in as it builds to it's strange climax.  Seeing it in Blu-Ray DVD recorded in 7.1 surround sound is a trip.  The detail and audio experience together on our 50\\" Samsung plasma 1080p HDTV run through our Onkyo HT-S7100 7.1 surround sound system is totally immersive into a surreal world.  Bizarre but throughly enjoyable.
0321544080|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I read a lot of reviews that said that the formulas for the pictures were incomplete, well they were.  Think about your profession: could you make a person equal to you at that task in one book.  This guy has been doing this 10 hours a day for years. Look at the pictures read the tips and go out and shoot.  Have fun!! But you probably won't do it like Joe Mcnally.
B000MRAAJW|2.0|I think I got a bad batch. Disc 2 in my set isn't recognized by my HDDVD player although all the others are. This was a brand new set, but something must have gone wrong when the disc was formatted.  I love the video, but I'm bummed about a lemon set.
1594201927|5.0|This is a very readable and well-informed history of finance, its readability due in part, no doubt, to the fact that it is \\"the book of the movie\\", being written as an accompaniment to the TV series of the same name, which was aired on both sides of the Atlantic in late 2008.  One of its principal strengths is also due to its TV origins - excellent descriptions of documented examples of key episodes in the evolution of modern finance - the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan crisis, the sub-prime mortgage debacle.  In spite of this populist writing approach, the book is authoritative and thorough.  Several hundred footnote references to other writers and an exceptionally lengthy list of acknowledgments of experts consulted, certify to its seriousness. Ferguson is a formidably learned academic with past and present academic achievements including professorships at Oxford, Harvard, NYU and Harvard Business School.  He has written extensively on modern history, his preferred fields being finance, economic history and colonialism.  He quite often argues unconventional views, a notable example being his view in \\"The War of the World\\" that it would have been better for Europe if Germany had won the First World War.  \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is however a straightforward history, organised by themes (Currency, Stocks, Credit, etc.) which are very well developed and illustrated by a multitude of fascinating examples and quotations. Inevitably for a book which takes its story up to May 2008, the reader will focus on the continuing story of the housing boom, the derivative explosion and the credit crisis. .  Equally inevitably, as the reader watches the crisis unfold further, he will wish the book were more fully up-to-date.  But Ferguson argues that the crisis is attributable to factors that do not require awaiting its conclusion to understand its causes - the inevitability of overshoot in the financial world, Darwinian creative destruction, greed,the innate human swings from euphoric confidence to distrust and despair. If, as in the past, others find his conclusions too controversial or perhaps simplistic, one can only reflect that events, opinions and decisions concerning the credit crisis which have emerged since May 2008 have added very little in the way of convincing explanations or courses of action.  \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is a very worthwhile read in very troubling times.    Vincent O'Doherty  February 15th 2009
B0018QOIXU|5.0|My husband gave this Adele 19 CD for Valentines.  I love it.  My favorite is the \\"pavement\\" song and the Garth Brooks song \\"Make you feel my love\\".  I have only listen thru the CD twice but I am sure this will be one of my favortes.  Looking forward to her next album.
B000JVT1U0|2.0|I never saw this film growing up and I can say I was very disappointed after viewing this slow moving and predictable horror tale. Aside from some gratuitous nudity and trippy camera shots, this film is quite strange and has an ending you can see coming from miles away! I know this film has a big cult following, but I just can't see why anyone would love this film!? Many of my Amazon friends like it and to each their own, but if you are not familiar with this film, keep your expectations in check. It may have had a bigger impact back in the day, but it seems dated now.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST TOUCHING TRUE STORY MOVIES I'VE SEEN.  A MAN WHO NEVER GIVES UP IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF HIS SON.  HOMELESS TO SUCCESSFUL
031606792X|5.0|Had to buy the hardcover version!  My husband and I both really liked the whole series.
B00064AM6C|5.0|There have already been plenty of reviews on this one, so I'm just point out a few things. Jack and Meg perform at their very best, and \\"man\\" are they GOOD!!! This concert DVD Rocks!!! They do some blues classics such as Lead Belly's \\"Take a Whiff on Me\\", and they do the Dolly Parson classic of \\"Jolene\\". I have never heard these classics performed so good.<br />This is a \\"Classic\\" concert DVD and will stand the test of time in my opinion. It's a must-have for any White Stripes fan.
1582406723|5.0|I typically do not like zombie movies, and comics but this is simply great. The writing and drawing is great! I wanted to read more immediately after reading this graphic novel. I have already ordered vol. 2 and vol. 3. I will start collecting the comics now, also.
074356619X|1.0|When this book became popular I jumped on the van wagon just as everyone else.  My best friend told me from the beginning she had a bad feeling about the Secret and warned me to stay away from it.  I found the idea of positive thinking fantastic and after a few months of exploring the idea I bought the book.  I read the entire book in a matter of a few hours.  First of all simply opening the book gave me goose bumps and by the end of the book a dark presence was felt in my room.  It was almost even hard to breathe, there was like this heaviness the air.  I called my neighbor and I told her what was happening after I read the book.  She told me to open my Bible and read the Psalms.  When I finished reading the Psalm my friend recommended a gush of wind left my room.  I jumped off my bed, ran out to my neighbors and through the book in the garbage on my way out.  I spent the night at my friend's and we prayed all night until we fell asleep.  Never again will I be curious about stuff like that.  So to everyone out there please, please, please stay away from that book and DVD.  If you already have throw it out.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|One of the best documentaries ever. You do not need a narrator for this movie. Classic cinematography.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|The main reason I like her music is because of the very clever and witty lyrics.  It's not recycled predictable radio material.  My ears want to burn listening to some of the crap produced by 'artists' these days whose songs are half text message and repeating the same crude line over and over.    Anyone who can dress political commentary in whimsical rhymes deserves points.
B0000033OT|1.0|SORRY! I expected more from Donny Hathaway. Two good songs and the rest I didn't like. Save your money and get the Greatest hits.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This album is very addicting; I listen to it often. I listened to it three times the day I got it from Amazon.com, from beginning to end.  I had never heard of Jason Mraz before, but I heard \\"I'm Yours\\" on a T.V. commercial promoting the album and felt it to be very unique.  Then I listened to the other songs on Amazon.com and loved them all!!!  Aside from the amazing musicianship, incredible audio production, and insightful lyrics by Jason Mraz, you can feel his joyful energy and happiness being expressed through his beautiful music and with the other artists on this album.  I find it difficult to describe such an incredible artist!  This is art, and there is so much depth to it that I recommend this album to you all.
1416562605|5.0|Book doesn't paint a very flattering view of Indian society but it is a wonderful read.  You feel like you have crawled inside the main character.  Suspenseful even though you know how it's going to end from the start.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This movie is excelent! The DVD isn't perfect because it doesn't come with all the extra features compared with a double-disc. However, the price make it my choice, since I don't pay attention to interviews and those other features they add in the extra DVD.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I wasn't interested in having the soundtrack, but after seeing the movie, I liked a couple of songs I heard and just decided to get it and I'm pretty happy with my decision. I love the first song \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" it just gets me pumped when I hear it and reminds me of the fun baseball scene, my favorite in the movie!! I like the the two Paramore songs, especially \\"Decode\\". My other favorite is the Iron & Wine song that is played while they are dancing at Prom...it is honestly the reason I decided to get the CD...its just very mellow and romantic. I'm sure the other songs will grow on me, I've only had the CD for about 2 days!!
B0000256VK|5.0|Can't agree any more with other raving 5-star reviews here about the timeless, lush, ethereal sounds evoked on this masterpiece. I find myself going back to this CD with increasing regularity. Great ambience and mood; true adult contemporary sophistication at it's zenith.
B001FB55LW|5.0|I just saw this movie at the theater yesterday not having high expectations for it, but I enjoyed the movie and thought it was a BLAST! It is the funniest movie I seen since Four Christmases and White Chicks in 2004 (there have been a few others but I currently can't recall at the top of my head).<br /><br />The funniest scene in the movie without spoiling the plot is where Jim Carrey's character runs from the hospital in his gown to see Zooey Daschael's character and almost gets himself killed riding his friend's out of this world heavy motorcycle (frankly it is a miracle he didn't get hit by another car or truck)! Another funny part of the movie was the part where Carrey's character clicks \\"yes\\" to the enlargement spam email on his work computer and later meets and Iranian woman. There are several other funny scenes throughout the movie with those two being my favorite.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth seeing at the theater (it is playing for $1.50 in the Blue-Ridge Cinemas in Raleigh) and with friends on DVD. You will be laughing every few minutes and chanting \\"Yes, Yes, Yes\\" for Carrey's character while you watch!
B000002L9J|5.0|Meat Is Murder was my first close encounter with the boys from Manchester and this MIM got me on my knees. I had to know more about this next big thing. Not too long The Smiths fell into my hands and whispered in my ears they were sort of skipping stages, like jumping from a Please Please Me to A Hard Day's Night and then to a Rubber Soul and then god only knows to what next. Too soon a rumor of an even better than the real thing spread in my neighborhood on the grounds that it was an imported, hard to find and priceless Hatful of Hollow. And I paid the price which turned out to be an anticipated and expensive invitation to a big party celebrating the long awaited death of the blue blood queen of Camelot. The party's treats and traits included only caviar and vintage wine and lasted for a whole week, like in those wedding parties in the old days of Cana in Palestine of the first century of the common era. An inside out dressed guest at this Dead Queen party approached whom he thought to be the bridegroom and said to him: Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now. I think that guest was that Amazon Dot Com bloke who wrote a review of this album stating that The Smiths are essentially a singles band. He was drunken but I think he was right. After all, every Smiths album is great and made of hit singles only or, as other blokes here commented a pop masterpiece that works as a collection of singles as well as a unified album, an instant classic with zero filler in sight. If you like good wine like that one served at Cana 2,000 years ago, I recommend you to start with The Smiths, Meat is Murder, Hatful of Hollow, Louder Than Bombs and Strangeways, Here We Come. Save this Dead Queen Label for a very special date, like your own funeral, for instances! Long live Morrissey and Marrs! Melody and lyrics highlights: 1. The Queen Is Dead = Starting me up ferociously = Prince Charles dressed in his mother's bridal veil? , 2. Frankly, Mr. Shankly = Catchy at its best = He is a flatulent pain the arse. 3. I Know It's Over = depressing and 'emo' contagiously ballad = If you're so funny, if you're so clever, If you're so very entertaining, If you're so very good-looking, why do you sleep alone tonight? 4. Never Had No One Ever = not arguably the weakest track, or almost a sequel to the previous song as some say, but I agree it is a kind of relief from the thunderous three opening tracks, memorably gorgeous though = I had a really bad dream, it lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days. 5. Cemetry Gates = perfectly pop, folk-rockish, head sticking song  = Wilde in on Moressey's side, Keats and Yeats are on somebody else side (but on mine are Austen, Lessing and Woolf, while Wilde, Keats and Yeats are on theirs, as I wrote in my 'Spectral Mornings'), 6. Bigmouth Strikes Again = terrific, powerful, it is the pinball wizard of the album = Joan of Arc has a roman nose. 7. The Boy With the Thorn in His Side = the most enchanting, irresistible catchiness = Behind the hatred there lies a murderous desire for love.  8. Vicar in a Tutu = ok, it is really just like ringo singing maxwell's silver hammer on the white album, or any Keith Moon's contribution to a who album, lazy but not bad, not even a filler = Rose counts the money in the canister as natural as rain he dances again; 9. There Is a Light That Never Goes Out =  hypnotic, lovely sick and gorgeously sad =To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die 10. Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others = some blokes here dare to say it is the weakest, my god, how can one make people realize what classics are like? = As Anthony said to Cleopatra, as he opened a crate of ale.
031606792X|1.0|First off, the only really great character of the series, Jacob, gets the short shrift.  Not only does he become a toddler's puppy, but the author leaves the opening for him NOT to ever have his story end up happy, and EVERYONE else gets the most unrealistic happy ending ever, to the point of ridiculousness.  A great fight was built, with absolutely no climax.  And the fact that the most self depricating, whiny, annoying young woman known to man is both exceedingly powerful AND tempered is just a laugh.  The writing is poor, but, on the *bright* side, it is such an easy read it's over with quickly.  My daughter expressed interest in this series so I pre read it.  If she really wants to, I will get them for her, but I will do my best to discourage her from the WORST female role model in literary history (INCLUDING Catherine of WH).
B001C08RHA|4.0|This movie is one of the best movies of super-hero I have ever seen. The DVD works pretty well. It is missing some extra features that should come in the double-disc version.  But the price made this version my choice.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|If it were merely a precautionary tale about a society lulled into totalitarian rule, I could recommend this movie as a well made, fun bit of eye candy.  There are certainly a lot of elements here to like. Specifically, the story telling is extremely effective, and the visual effects are stunning.  Despite all this, \\"V For Vendetta\\" is wrecked by it's absolutley relentless ranting against nationalism, conservatism, and to a lesser extent Christianity.  In particular it is a soup-to-nuts diatribe against the United States war on terror, and is intended to inform us that supposed Islamic acts of terror were actually manufactured by conservatives in order to enslave the nation and exterminate homosexuals and artists.    I won't bother to enumerate the twisted parallels between the movie plot and the war on Islamic terrorism.  I'm sure they have been identified and argued to death already.  I would like to point out however, that as of the date I am writing this review, the world is now safe from George W. Bush, who has quietly ridden off into the sunset, just like all previous U.S. presidents.    A side note: The 1934 movie adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas novel \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is referenced multiple times through out \\"V For Vendetta\\".  The 2002 movie adaptation is excellent and highly recommended.    Let me leave you with a question to ponder.  Do you think Hollywood will ever produce a movie about a left-of-center government that manufactures a global economic meltdown in order to usher in unprecedented socialist policies, and supress conservative political speach?
B0015OKWL2|2.0|After teaming with Al Pacino in \\"88 Minutes,\\" one of the dumbest and most ridiculous movies of the decade, Avnet follows up with \\"Righteous Kill,\\" which is not nearly as bad, but  leaves a lot to be desired. The movie leads you along a certain path, only to reveal at the end an unexpected turn. Yes, it's unexpected. It's also kind of ridiculous. One and a half stars.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Paul's for over 40 years...  I have every release that he's ever put out.  Unfortunately, he's been in steady decline musically over the last several years.  This latest work is no exception.  \\"Memory almost full\\" was a more recent work before this debacle...  Try, \\"Memory almost fried\\"?!?  I don't mean to be blunt, but it's really time to \\"hang em up\\"!  Just tour singing the old standards!!!  Please Paul, nothing new!  I love your stuff, but someone has to be honest in critiquing your last few offerings.  They're misdirected, disjointed and have little if any flow to them.  Reading all of the reviews is certainly fans paying homage to your entire career.  I'm sorry, but you need to call it one.
0345495004|2.0|I live in a city with a FLW masterpiece - Grady Gammage Auditorium. Its a lovely place to see a show, but otherwise I have never been interested in the architect.  Someone in my book group suggested this one and I thought it would be a good way of learning about this man, very famous in our state. Well, I suspect there are better ways, because this one wasn't it.<br /><br />At the beginning, when the two first met and fell in love, I was quite entralled with the book.  When she made her decision to go to Germany, I didn't approve but this is after all history and I went along for the ride. But after that it just fell apart. Between her angst at the reaction her scandal brought (which she should have known would happen), her needing to find herself, and her angst about how she hurt her children (but still stayed in Europe) put me off.  I got very little of what sparked this love affair and what kept it going; what was it about FLW that made her leave her life and children, and to stay away even tho she pined so much for them? There was nothing in the book that showed anything about FLW except as an egotistical, lying genius who spent money he didn't have.  I would have loved to have seen another side of him, to find out what drove him, but again there was nothing in the text to answer the questions. The narration became repetitive and rather boring. The ending was quite a shock, and I felt badly of course for her.  But that didn't help me have much sympathy or respect for the woman.<br /><br />There is a new book out by TC Boyle called The Women, about FLW's three wives, and Mamah. I started it and it already feels like the book I am looking
006135323X|5.0|I enjoyed the book. Very well written, with a lot of knew knowledge. Easy to understand. Well documented, from the scientific point of view. I recomend this book.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|I watched these movies 20+ years ago and now my 13 year old loves them! Not as good as the first one, but still plenty of laughs!
6305754969|5.0|This movie is the best movie from the Duke that we have yet to watch. We probably have found over 40 of his movies so far, and continue to look for them. Our 2 favorites are Rio Bravo and El Dorado.  The story lines are similar in some ways, but we like to watch them both. Robert Mitchum puts on one of his best acting performances. If you like the Duke, you gotta see this movie.
0375842209|4.0|First of all, yeah, I did cry with this book, more than once. I also laughed at points. The writing style is good; I don't think I'm spoiling it for anyone if I mention that Death itself is the narrator. Extravagant as Death is, the words flow in an extravagant way, yet easy to read.    However, in terms of storyline, more than a few times it feels formulaic, almost as a cliche. I didn't feel I was getting newer or more interesting insights about the horrors brought about by the Nazis. It's all things we have already seen in the movies and read elsewhere. I'm not saying that we should forget; I'm saying that our understanding of the events should be getting deeper and more sophisticated by now. It's important because it's the understanding of human nature, after all.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Excellent Song Track. Highly recommend this track for those who love danancing, especially if you were around during the'50's.
0446530573|5.0|This is a very well written Italian cookbook, full of hearty comfort food.  Refreshingly traditional southern Italian cooking without the fuss of nouveau cuisine. Being a fan of the show, I  relished all the history that was included
6305076995|5.0|This Dvd It's totaly acceptable, the quality i'ts fine and the sound its good, I'm not a great fan of YES but I really want to know more about this band, so I select this DVD and when I saw this Concert I really understand the perfect style from this band and This DVD show a great acoustic guitar player, so enjoy this DVD!!! GREAT YES!!!!
B000O599WG|5.0|One of the best from the Duke. This was the first movie that actually shows Dean Martin acting abilities. These 2 and Walter Brennen make a great trio. You'll love this movie.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I just have to say that this album is a work of genius. Probably the best one released by 'alternative' rockers in the last couple of years. I regret I never downloaded it when it was available for free.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|Sadly buried in the archives for commercial reasons (giving priority to Solti's studio recording), the first stereo recording of the Ring made by Decca live in Bayreuth with a glorious cast(with one singer to each role) and a musical and intense conducting,a wise middle way between Kna and Böhm. The recorded sound is slightly dated in comparison with the modern standards, but extraordinary in consideration of its time (1955),much better than any historical recording,dynamic,well focused, carefully balanced and with that special touch of magic typical of Wagner's temple.
0307454894|5.0|\\"Why does what was beautiful suddenly shatter in hindsight because it concealed dark truths?\\"  This is the essential question of Bernhard Schlink's provocative, morally complex novel, \\"The Reader.\\"  The book was published in Germany in 1995 and translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway in 1997, but it has gained a new following due to the 2008 award-winning film directed by Stephen Daldry and starring Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet.  While the film focuses on the difficulties subsequent generations have had coming to terms with the holocaust, the novel is also about the past in general, the way it haunts and shapes the present.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the new film, mostly because I read the novel first and I feel the film fails to capture the honesty, guilt and uncertainty with which the protagonist, Michael Berg, narrates.  The story begins in West Germany in the 50's when Michael is fifteen and suffering from hepatitis.  One day he finds himself weak, exhausted and retching outside an apartment building, and suddenly an attractive woman is escorting him up to her apartment:  \\"When rescue came, it was almost an assault.  The woman seized my arm and pulled me through the dark entryway into the courtyard.\\"<br /><br />The woman is Hanna Schmitz, a thirty-six year old tram conductress with whom he begins sleeping with after she catches him watching her get dressed.  Over the next few months, they develop a routine of bathing, having sex and reading, Michael reading aloud to Hanna the classics of German literature.<br /><br />As the older Michael struggles to make sense of his memories, especially in terms of what he finds out about Hanna later on, he becomes reflective and questioning, seeking an understanding that continues to elude him: \\"But we were happy!  Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily.  Because happiness is only real if it lasts forever? Because things always end painfully if they contained pain, conscious or unconscious, all along?  But what is unconscious, unrecognized pain?\\"<br /><br />In other words, can past joy remain in tact, given present, darker truths?  What if the one you loved committed a great crime you found out many years later?  Does that destroy your initial love?  How is memory shaped by present knowledge and circumstances?<br /><br />This is truly an unforgettable story of love, terror and forgiveness, one that is directly and lyrically told and anything but easy to forget.?  But what is unconscious, unrecognized pain?\\"    In other words, can past joy remain in tact, given present, darker truths?  What if the one you loved committed a great crime you found out many years later?  Does that destroy your initial love?  How is memory shaped by present knowledge and circumstances?    This is truly an unforgettable story of love, terror and forgiveness, one that is directly and lyrically told and anything but easy to forget.
0784011710|4.0|this was such an incredible heart wrenching film that is hard to bear and one wonders why this concept was greenlighted, the secret that not only Jews were persecuted, that a mother had to make a choice about their childrens death in line, that any choice she made was so defensible and no judgement would be incurred by anyone who never experienced such horror???... and to ajudicate an audience's heartstrings became the nouveaux film genre for Oscar wins...I keep thinking that Terms of Endearment followed these footsteps to copy this formula and it makes me insane to think how manipulative producers are to garnish another notch in the knife to the heart...oh well, unbelievable performances by Streep, and Kline was amazing....being a parent I can never disrespect the atrocities of this era but to milk it, esp with the endscene, JEEZ LOUISE!!!  I can barely handle I am Sam, let alone this screamplay, I can only cry for so long for my losses, and never feel good enough to earn my sympathy...if I am wrong, my deepest apologies to those whose intent to enlighten us was sincere.

B00004CY6E|1.0|Hello,  Be sure to check the format of a DVD before buying. I spent $50 for a 2 disk DVD that will not work on my USA DVD player. The format is in PAL for European DVD players. Caveat emptor!
140120841X|5.0|and the movie was great!  What makes the graphic novel better is the depth of the characters.  The Leader is not the snarling sociopath as portrayed by John Hurt in the movie.  Instead, he is an intelligent, thoughtful man who really believes he is doing the best for his country.  There are whole characters and storylines that didn't make it into the movie.  I don't blame the moviemakers--they had to edit somewhere--but their addition makes the book richer and more complex.  Enjoy the movie by all means, but do read the book for a greater understanding of both V and the world he is trying to change.  I will say that the two most affecting parts of the movie--the story of Valerie and the confession of the doctor--are taken almost verbatim from the book.  So read the book AND see the movie.  They are both well worth your time.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|There's a solid James Bond film here...but you don't get to see it.<br /><br />I loved CASINO ROYALE and it instantly rocketed up to my top three favorite Bond films (FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE are the other two).<br /><br />But QUANTUM OF SOLACE was a disappointment.  Where was Martin Campbell, the director of Pierce Brosnan's only excellent Bond film, GOLDENEYE, and Daniel Craig's debut?  The direction here was sloppy with touches of arty scene intros, the editing was dizzying to the point of confusion during the action scenes.  The cuts were so fast in the opening sequence that I wasn't so sure which car was which.  The same could be said for the foot chase just after the main titles--was that Bond or the other guy in some fleeting glimpses?<br /><br />Director Marc Foster was brought on to bring a human element to a Bond film, something he did with films like MONSTER'S BALL and FINDING NEVERLAND.  But he never takes more than two seconds and a couple of lines to try and do that.  It felt like the filmmakers had no confidence in the material and decided to keep spinning this merry-go-round faster and faster.  The movie runs short.  Take a minute or two.  Develop something.  Look at what CASINO ROYALE did.<br /><br />Bond drags Mathis back into his world but doesn't say much about how disastrous that turns out.  Bond treats the main Bond girl with kid gloves (I guess because she has burn scars on her spine) but doesn't mind seducing the one woman on his own team (again, resulting in disastrous results for her).  There are glimpses that he's doing this to avenge Vesper Lynde from CASINO ROYALE, and there's a nice little scene at the end that felt like another lost opportunity to get closer to this new, tougher Bond...but it didn't happen.  Did we have to cut away so soon for this confrontation?  Couldn't we at least find out WHAT he said/did to that guy?<br /><br />Did I want to see Bond emote?  Cry?  No.  But M knows precisely why he's doing what he's doing and she hardly calls him on it.  In fact, everyone knows why he's doing what he's doing...yet he remains stoically aloof.<br /><br />And, please, get a director who doesn't have to learn how to make a James Bond movie while he's making a James Bond movie.  Bring back Martin Campbell.  He's directed the two best Bond films in the past 20 years.<br /><br />The 007 films are my favorites and I eagerly look forward to each and every one of them.  Dollar for dollar, they always provide the best entertainment bang for the buck.<br /><br />But QUANTUM OF SOLACE doesn't make the top five.  The direction is too chaotic, the script isn't quite refined enough to rise to the level of the best Bonds, the relationships of 007 with the girls feel rushed and obligatory.  (The main title song has grown on me though).<br /><br />I love Daniel Craig as Bond.  I was rooting for him before CASINO ROYALE when the fans and the press were being so horrible to him and he knocked the ball right out of the park the first time out.  I hope he can do it in the next film.calls him on it.  In fact, everyone knows why he's doing what he's doing...yet he remains stoically aloof.

B001676320|5.0|I have this concert video on regular dvd and when I saw it at Amazon for a low price for the blu-ray version I just had to give it a try.  The quality of the video on blu-ray is so much better than regular dvd that it's worth buying it.  This is a two disc regular dvd set, but on blu-ray since it holds more information, it's all on a single disc.  If you like Earth, Wind & Fire and Chicago this was a great concert, BUY IT.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|If you like the Beatles music, and if you're particularly fond of George Harrison, this is simply a wonderful musical.  Clapton is a superb mc, we now all know why Billy Preston was considered \\"the 5th Beatle\\", and the performances, all my George's friends, are superb.  Every once in a great while, something gets put together that simply gets it all right.  Have a good time - it doesn't get any better than this.
0375842209|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read.  It was an interesting viewpoint of Germans during WWII who hated Hitler but were stifled by the impending threat of not supporting him. Anyone who is at all interested in WWII should read this from high school age and up!
B00004W4UB|5.0|Mary Reiley, masterfully played by Julia Roberts and Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde brilliantly performed by John Malkovich is a suspenseful recreation of the split personality of a man who has an inner evil twin who takes the lives of others as he experiences rage and the desire to control.    If you know the background of the original work by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, you know that it is about split personalities, surfacing the fact that within each of us there is the possibility of good and evil and that every human being, if all virtue is removed [kindness, compassion, love, hope, charity, faith] is capable of committing atrocities and go back to animal instincts.     The duality we find in ourselves, if not dealt with in an effort to understand our faults, may create personalities that project evil onto others, surfacing anger, rage, depression and lack of self esteem. Humans that do not deal with their inner demons end displaying an outward respectability that is nothing but social hypocrisy that masks a tendency for inner sins, whether these be lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy or pride.     The movie is set in London and the plot for the most part, takes place in the mansion, with an intuitive and inquisitive Mary Reiley providing her interpretation of the conflict experienced by Dr. Jekyll. Mary Reiley suffered greatly as a child in the hands of an abusive father and as such, she understands the evil within others and how harmful it was to her, therefore, how harmful it is to those that Mr. Hyde encounters during the night.     The plot scenes are set in dark places, Mary Reiley is asked to visit houses of ill repute, where Glenn Close plays the part of the \\"madam\\" who will permit Dr. Jekyll to engage in all sorts of evil acts as long as he pays a good price.    We get the feeling that Mary Reiley ends loving her kind employer, the first man to ever protect and confide in her, and that through this love and acceptance of his good and evil, sheinspires the evil side to put an end to all suffering. If you like mystery, suspense, horror and dark romance, this is a movie for you! While not our favorite type movie, we were thrilled by the performances. Don't miss it!
B000002868|5.0|Ok, Here I am sitting in front of this machine ater 54 years on this planet writing my first music review. I am not going to get into a song by song evaluation of this album...oops(showing my age) nor am I going to try to say anything more or different than those who have already done a worthy job of reviewing this music. But, I will say that in 1971 being 17 years young and having just moved to a small town in South Carolina, where there were only two types of accepted music; country and western finding albums of this type to say the least was a major undertaking. Suffice to say, having moved there from a more progressive venue I was the harbinger of change and subversion to this small country town and what I brought was this album and a few more like it. I had been listening to Miles Davis and others up to this point and though the release dates are 6 months separated I had actually heard Mahavishnu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame before I heard this album. When my Buds and I lit that bud and put this album on the turntable the first time we were transported to a new musical landscape John Mclauglin (another Miles musician) notwithstanding. I think, all that need be said is put it on take a listen or 20 and if this music doesn't move you in some way or blow your mind (especially taking the time of its release) then all I can say is maybe fusion is just not your cup of tea!! One of the great fusion albums of the time!!!

B001DHXT6G|3.0|1. The Episode names are NOT listed on any disk and should be.  Each of the 3 boxes with the disks has a series of cards that tells the Episode name per disk, this is wrong.  I had to number each disk and ceate a Word document that has the disk number and the Episode Titles.  I have never bought disks that did not have the names listed.    2.  Each of the 3 seasons comes in a plastic box with the Star Trek Emblem.  Inside each box is a paper box.  The outer plastic box is not needed and they can lower the price if they stop using this.      3.  The Color/Quality per Episode is AMAZING.    This is a Must Have for any Star Trek fan if you can live with the Episodes not labeled per disk.

045122499X|5.0|Ken Follett is a master craftman at telling stories.  I loved Pillars of the Earth, and World Without End does not disappoint.  It takes place in the same town as Pillars, but 200 years later.  It's not necessary to have read Pillars to enjoy World Without End.  Mr. Follett has apparently done his homework in terms of the details of life in the 1300s.  The novel contains much engineering, crafting, legal, political, and religious historical information that illustrates how this town functioned and how the characters relate to each other.  But there are also plenty of typical Middle Ages novel elements--romance, knights and damsels in distress, inquisition-like trials, plot twists galore.  I read it in 4 days!
B000FS9MV0|2.0|Renee, child, what were you thinking?Don't you have PEOPLE? Like others, I've been waiting for years for your follow-up, and those silly people ran ramshod over the making of this CD! Why did they suffocate you with this smarmy stuff, and the production is piss-poor...You and Mr. Foster put one on us with your epilogue cut, \\"nothing but the blame\\", by far the best selection. We got sucker-punched, and you, little pretty one with the captivating voice and monster potential, got robbed!
B000002WEW|5.0|This is one of the recordings that I have always had around. I bought my first copy from the RCA record club when I was about 12. It was this LP that first introduced me to Southern Gospel. J.D. Sumner and the stamps Quartet lifted this style of music to the stars with their hard driving harmony.<br />The crowning moment of this concert was \\"American Trilogy.\\" I really don't think there are any pop singers around these days that would have the back bone to perform this kind of music in public: religous music mixed with a good measure of southern folk music thrown in! Purely controversial...LOL
0743454537|5.0|I read this book in one day.  Ms. Picoult knows how to tell a story.  This plot line is a ripped-from-the-headlines issue, that of whether it's right to engineer a baby to save a sibling, and once this baby grows and develops her own mind, how much decision-making power she has over medical decisions to save her ill sister.  But she tells the human side of it and the parents' conflicted feelings on it, as well as from the points of view of the children, the lawyer, and the guardian at litem.  Highly recommended.
B0001I561E|5.0|DVD arrived in like new condition and our little one has been enjoying it since!
B00000583F|4.0|This is the North California stoner trio's 2nd CD. Unless I'm mistaken, I believe I saw them on this very tour when they were support band for Nik Turner on his state side 'Prophets Of Time' trek. Tunes I liked best here include \\"The Druid\\", the brief snippet \\"Some Grass\\", \\"Holy Mountain\\", the heavily Sabbath-influenced - ten minute epic \\"From Beyond\\" and the thumping \\"Rain's Baptism\\". Line-up: Matt Pike (now, of High On Fire)-guitar, Al Cisneros-bass & vocals and Chris Hakius-drums. Should appeal to fans of Fu Manchu, Trouble, early Sabbath, Monster Magnet, Boris, Saint Vitus, Sons Of Otis, the list goes on.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I purchased this item while in England because Amazon.com was the party fulfilling the DVD order.  That used to give me confidence, but not any more.  The DVD was NOT as new, it was scratched beyond being payable.  I had to pay someone to professionally clean the disk so it would be usable.  The most irratating part was that I was expected to pay international shipping to get the disk back to them.  Grrrrrrrrrrr, because it was cheaper to have the disk repaired than to mail it back to the States.  No compensation has been offered.  Grrrrrrr again!
0440241030|5.0|This is the first Lee Child novel about Jack Reacher that I have read, and I really enjoyed it. Unlike other novels I have read lately, this was a real page-turner and I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />The hero of the book is the loner Jack Reacher, ex US Army CID (Criminal Investigation Command). At the start of the book, he happens to have observed a man crossing the street and getting in to a car. This turns out to be a kidnapper picking up the ransom payment, and Jack Reacher gets involved in the case.<br /><br />The story is pretty action-packed, and more and more is revealed about the kidnapping. There is (of course) more to the kidnapping than first meets the eye, and I particularly liked how Jack Reacher on many occasions was using clues that had been presented to the reader to get closer to the solution. In this way, this book was similar to a typical crime novel, where clever reasoning and keen observations lead the investigator further.<br /><br />At the same time, there was enough action and suspense to qualify this as a real thriller. The final shoot-out is particularly pulse-raising, but there were several other good passages in the book that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The cast of characters is good to, with a valiant hero and suitably nasty bad guys.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good, fast, action-packed thriller, I can recommend this one. I will definitely read more of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels.
0321543726|5.0|Well, since other reviewers have done a great job of explaining exactly why this book is great, I will just add a \\"me too\\".    I am a professional C++ programmer, but have always enjoyed Bjarne's writings. He always gives you something new and for an experienced programmer it is interesting to get insight into his style and methods.    Another point is that this is the only C++ tutorial I know of that supports both Windows and Unix/Linux, so it would be a great introduction to multi platform programming.    I also got so if someone asks be on a good book to learn C++ I have one that I have read and can recommend.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Every year for Christmas at my brother's we spend the day playing board games together verses opening hundreds of presents we couldn't afford in the first place. When he brought this one out I thought it looked simple and boring. I quickly found it to be anything but. I, in fact, found myself asking to play again...over and over again. I appreciate the strategy and brain power that goes into finding a way to make all of my pieces fit (a puzzle of sorts). Quickly tried to order one for myself.
0061706620|5.0|To say the least. Most books like this are a great idea but fall utterly flat in execution. This was absolutely NOT the case here. While I would have liked more lore and some tidbits or hints of creatures to come (it would/will be weird to see an ep where the show references something in the Journal that isn't in this book) but aside from that this book is a great read and a must for any die hard fan of the series.    It takes you from John's first bewildered days as a novice hunter up until his death. To say it sheds more light on the pivotal but not well understood character is to put it mildly. How he agonized over the way he was raising his sons, worried about the men they would become, felt guilt about depriving Dean of the opportunity to have a family of his own... it just adds more depth and passion to the series as it stands.     I highly recommend this to any fan of the show.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I begged my husband for this DVD and it was the best Valentine's gift I ever got!  I grew up in the '60s and '70s but was forbidden to listen to rock music and missed out on hearing Zep (with the exception of at my senior prom where my soul came alive to 'Stairway to Heaven').  I recall being in total awe and that feeling has only grown throughout the years.  I have every Led Zeppelin song loaded into my ipod and each and every day as I exercise it is the mighty Led Zep that has kept my figure nice & tight all these years...lol.  I never got to rock out in my younger days but I am making up for it now.  This is music that never ages!  I can listen to every song over and over and it never gets stale.  And my workouts would not be so effective if I didn't have Achilles Last Stand, When the Levee Breaks, Kashmir or Trampled Underfoot getting my adrenalin flowing.      This DVD is absolutely awesome and fills me in on what I missed in my younger years.  It makes me crave to go back in time, to be a teenager again and to live in those moments.  What I wouldn't give to have a time machine and be in those crowds where I SHOULD have been, watching and screaming in sheer amazement at the magic before me.  It is all so bittersweet now, seeing and hearing these Gods of Rock and wondering how my parents could have been so cruel as to keep me from the experience!   The wonderful thing is that my teenage daughter not only likes Zep, but it is almost mandatory in her high school to be a fan!  It blows my mind that the same band that I was forbidden from hearing is still as popular today as it was then.  There has never been anyone like them and there never will be, and their work is timeless.    I love the entire DVD set, but what blew me away was John Bonham performing 'Moby Dick'.  I have always been a huge fan of his drumming (he is my favorite of the group because of that) but to see him live and up close left me in total awe.  It also made me feel so sad and empty at knowinghe is gone, because he truly was the greatest drummer that has ever lived, in my humble opinion.      I gave this DVD 5-stars but really, I would give it more if I could.  This is the closest thing to a time-machine, and I know I will be watching it again and again.

B000UNYJXQ|3.0|Personally, I value the documentary work Michael Moore has done over his career thus far.  He takes interesting and hard looks at social topics that are often muddled via that media, talking heads and politicos.<br /><br />Sicko addresses a topic that I personally follow the news about extensively and watch folks I kinow struggle with all the time: the US health care system.<br /><br />While I think this piece of work is helpful to open the general American's eyes to the irony and failure of many of our current health care issues, I was quite disappointed in his overall presentation of the topic.<br /><br />One niggling point, early on in the film he showed a document that listed the US as 37 on a ranked list of countries by health care -- just below Slovenia.  Yet just below the US was Cuba, which later is exemplified as a superior system.<br /><br />There are other discrepancies and a fair bit of simply leaving out the whole 'truth' of the matter, particularly with regard to the socialized health care in France and England.  In fact NPR did a much more thorough job of looking at and comparing these health care systems to the US's in the run up to the 2008 presidential election.<br /><br />Bottom line, Moore's work does reach a broader audience and provides considerable food for thought that may go a long way in galvanizing people to press their elected representatives to improve the US health care system.  It is 'sick' that the wealthiest nation on earth should have a system that allows people to unnecessarily die for basic ailments or bankrupt people who actually HAVE health care insurance.<br /><br />There is a fundamental flaw here that should be addressed and for that I think Sicko is at least a worthwhile film to watch.
0060899220|5.0|It starts off a bit slow with his childhood in France and his \\"stoner\\" teenage years, but once it kicks into the nitty gritty, behind the scene operations (and lack there of) in running a restaurant, it becomes a true page-turner.  His straight-forward delivery of his experiences is entertaining, yet clearly lays out the ridiculous amount of time and dedication required to excel in this line of work.   I particularly enjoyed how the book was not all just about him.  He spends many chapters focused on his co-workers, from the dishwasher to his sous-chef to the restaurant owners, etc.  It should be required reading for any \\"wannabe\\" chef.  It is a real eye-opener for the rest of us who take \\"eating out\\" for granted.    My favorite advice from the book:  Never Order the Fish outside of Friday or Saturday; and if the bathroom is a mess, imagine what the kitchen looks like...leave immediately!  Good stuff.
0887306667|3.0|Like Marketing, times and preferences change. Very little of this book addresses the fast paced changes that have occured.  This book is the equivalent to an ancient text from which you can pull some lasting principles but for modern marketing in action you would need to look elsewhere.

B000005KQT|5.0|As one of the fathers of the postwar Chicago urban blues harmonica style, Little Walter remains one of the greatest players of that instrument.<br />His classic \\"Juke\\" is an exciting instrumental that is the first \\"serious\\" showpiece for many emerging blues harpists.<br /><br />In fact, every leading blues harmonica player who followed Little Walter-and even most of his contemporaries-studied him closely, and can be heard playing his songs and licks. His playing influenced George Smith, Walter Horton, James Cotton, Charlie Musselwhite, Paul Butterfield, John Mayall, and many others too numerous to mention here.<br /><br />Walter Jacobs was also a fine blues singer, closely involved with the lyric, using a minimum of vocal ornamentation. He was not a \\"power\\" singer like Elmore James, but one whose vocal style embodied studied restraint. Walter sang all the typical blues motifs capably, from the down-and-out lovesick blues numbers (\\"Mean Old World\\") to the blues-shuffle storytelling songs (\\"Key to the Highway\\") to the uptempo, optimistic tunes (\\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\\") that provide contrast to the sad blues themes.<br /><br />This is the real deal. The musicians on this recording grew up during hard times, many of them in the country in Mississippi; playing the blues was their outlet for expression and relaxation. No \\"arts funding\\" was needed for their learning.<br /><br />It's a superb collection of classic blues songs, and an amazing bargain at the offered price. Highly recommended to all blues lovers, aspiring blues musicians, and listeners who are just beginning to explore blues music. Can't say enough good things about this fine collection.

Joss made the point about the cowboy thang and in those 2, it was a little overdone... the rest of the shows were balanced as far as the theme goes, and made sense in an orderly fashion, liked all that were aired and hoped to expand on themes, such as persons and personalities, there were too many questions about them and the mix, the only 2 clear relationships were Mal and Zoe.<br /><br />The firefly class ship is not scientifically feasible,among other oxygen and physics problems, I think solving those problems would had added life / longevity, to the series

1402210795|5.0|After years of hearing the praises of author Georgette Heyer, I could no longer resist the temptation and dove in head first on the recommendation of Heyer enthusiast Vic (Ms. Place) of Jane Austen's World, selecting the author's favorite book Friday's Child. Since Heyer published 56 books over 53 years, she had a few to choose from and I was confident that this neophyte would have one of the better novels to begin my indoctrination. I now see what all the fuss is about. Georgette Heyer is a treasure.<br /><br />Spendthrift Anthony Verelst, Viscount Sheringham doesn't give a fig about his finances until his creditors do. Selfish, impetuous and deeply in debt, he is unable to access his inheritance until he reaches 25 or marries and sets out to acquire a wife proposing to his neighbor and lifelong friend Isabella Milborne, an `Incomparable', whose beauty and elegance are renown. She doesn't think much of the idea or of Lord Sheringham's dissipated lifestyle and rebuffs the offer. Indignant, he swears to marry the next girl he sees who happens to be seventeen year old Hero Wantage, the neighborhood orphan Cinderella living with cousins who want to farm her out to be a governess. By no means a scholar, Hero is miffed by the work plan just wanting to have a bit of fun and enjoy the charms of society in London. Seizing the opportunity, Hero accepts Sherry's proposal and they run away to London to be married. It is here we are introduced to the real heart of the story, Sherry's three male friends: his two cousins steady Gilbert (Gil) Ringwood and the foppish Hon. Ferdinand (Ferdy) Fakenham, and his hot headed friend George, Lord Wrotham who form sort of a bumbling bachelors club of Regency society dandies. Their influence drives the story as they help Hero (nicknamed Kitten) unschooled in the nuances of social etiquette and a bit lacking in common sense out of all sorts of scrapes that threaten her reputation and infuriate her husband who in turn is as equally clueless about his own responsibilities as a newly married man.<br /><br />Heyer gives us a delightful view of Regency era London with its social outlets for the rich: fashion, dancing, parties, gambling, romantic intrigues, and the gambit of other frivolous extravagances that entertain the high society 'ton' world. Her characters are each distinctive in personality and well drawn out. The three bachelor friends were especially enjoyable as their priceless dialogue humorously captures that uniquely British drawing room chatter of \\"I dare says\\" and \\"dash it alls\\" that at times from other authors seems trite, but in this case just lifted the colloquial credibility and ambience. Even though this novel was written over sixty years ago, it is surprisingly superior in style and creativity to many being produced today. Friday's Child reads like an expertly paced stage play, and I felt the influence of Heyer's contemporaries in playwrights Noel Coward and George Bernard Shaw in the satirical social commentary and humorous biting dialogues. There were a few holes in the plot such as Sherry's concerns over his uncle's abuse of the trusteeship of his estate not materializing or Hero's continual naïvet&eacute; among others, but they were very minor and did not spoil my enjoyment. The gradual maturity and transition by both protagonists gave for a rewarding end. It is easy to see why so many Jane Austen fans adore Georgette Heyer as they share in the sisterhood of the `Gentle Reprove Society' of comedic social satire. Friday's Child matched it's namesake from the old nursery rhyme as loving and giving, and critics marginalizing Heyer's works as mere romances take heed. Like Austen's novels, this is so much more than Chicklit.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenproseown responsibilities as a newly married man.

B00005JPCF|3.0|Happy Feet is set in Antartica in society of penguins who attract mates through song. However, Happy FEET is the story of a penguin who can't sing very well and instead dances (hence the title of the movie).However, the young penguin, Mumble, is laughed at and ostracized by his fellow penguins for not only his horrible singing, but his dancing too. However, after running into a groupe of \\"hispanic\\" penguins, a series of incidents occur and an adventure of epic proportions begins . . .<br /><br />Now personally, I did NOT like Happy Feet. Maybe it was the singing in dancing? Maybe it was the cliche message? I don't know. However, no longer being a kid, I'm trying to take a more objective look at Happy Feet. I'm going to start with why I liked the movie and then why I didn't like the mnvie.<br /><br />Reasons I liked (to a certain extent) Happy Feet:<br /><br />1) Robin Williams was hilarious as Lovelace and the little munchkin penguins . . . Though some maybe be insulted by little stereotypical (to a certain extent) penguins (though I doubt the kids would be offended so it's more the adults to look out for . .  .I suppose)<br /><br />2) The environmentalist message .  . . Kids gotta learn that their actions (littering being one of them) has impacts (sometimes devestating)on the environment and those living in the environment (such as the penguins)<br /><br />Reasons I didn't like Happy Feet . . .:<br /><br />1)The singing . . . I don't recall if there was a single orginal song in this movie . .  . .I don't know . . Maybe Warner Bros. movies just don't do original songs . . . .<br /><br />2) The other, more misguided message . . .Yes . .we should all learn to appreciate those who are different, but I don't think we should wait until he or she saves our lives first . . .After a person (or penguin in this case) saves a life, then one might say the person is now a hero/heroine rather than someone \\"different\\" who simply should be respected and appreciated for who they are rather then what they become (which in the case of this movie would be a \\"hero\\") . . .but maybe I'm just overthinking this . ..s movie would be a \\"hero\\") . . .but maybe I'm just overthinking this . ..
B00005QIPH|4.0|I'm looking back at this album a good while after it came out, long past their hype as \\"The Saviors of Rock and Roll.\\" They certainly weren't and this album definitely doesn't deserve all the accolades it received. However, when you look at this album without the hype and build up that surrounded its original release, it is a pretty solid album, and definitely an enjoyable listen. Almost every song is a catchy toe-tapper. Julian Casablancas' vocal delivery is wonderful. The music is nothing complex, usually very simple drum beats under repetitive riffs or straight sixteenth notes, but their energy makes it work. The only real problem with this is that there is nothing on this album that hasn't been done better by bands like Television, The Stooges and The Velvet Underground. If you can get past the hype and the lack of originality, this is a very solid album, certainly the best of their three releases to date.

Even with this knowledge, I was still not prepared for the gritty and plain spoken story that Marcus Luttrell presents.  The first hand account both of his training and of his horrifying battle will shake the best of us.  It is amazing to me that he survived.    I would encourage anyone to read this story to fully understand what is occurring today.  He tells it from the warrior's viewpoint and what more relevant position is there?    Thank you, Marcus, for sharing your story, your courage and most of all, for defending our nation.

As an actor, I can appreciate the humor and the characters within the show, all overdone (which is how most musicals are)  As a musician I am slightly disappointed only because these actors are not necessarily singers.

B001RTIHPS|1.0|I thought the acting was particularly flat. I don't know what's going on with Lana only that perhaps her contract requries her to still be on the show. Why is lex out of the picture - is he pregnant or something? I've not been this dissapointed in what was a solid creative show than now. Please tell me this is a guest director, or some sort of spoof that will be somehow undone by a time machine or something much more plausable than the action in the past two episodes.    It hurts, like watching your child fail only you can't be there in any way to make it better other than resign and go watch Friends reruns.

Le Carre's prose is sublime. A yarn spun about terrorism and its witting and unwitting subjects. I loved it and then it was suddenly over, in a kind of shaggy dog fashion...I wanted it to go on but alas Le Carre' put down his pen and sent it off to his publisher. A very good read that pulls up short at the end ,but still worthwhile. Next Book Club selection; Rabbit Run.

B00125WAWS|5.0|Although there is some confusion, if not controversy, surrounding the facts on which this commercial film \\"The Great Debaters\\" is based it is nevertheless a well-done piece of cinema. When one says the name Denzel Washington, who starred in and directed the film, and adds the imprimatur of Ophrah Winfrey as producer then those factors alone usually insure a well thought out presentation. Add in a slice of pre-1960's civil rights movement Southern Jim Crow black history surrounding the extraordinary abilities of the debate team at Wiley College, a small black Texas college, and the headline of this entry - \\"A Case Of Black Pride\\"- tells the tale.     The subject matter of this film: the trials and tribulations of a debate team as it tries to make its mark in the intellectual world would not, on the face it, seem to be a natural subject for a two hour film. Nor would the fact that this debate team was composed of and led by the black \\"talented tenth\\" of the 1930's, including James Farmer, Jr. who would later will fame as a main stream \\"establishment\\" civil rights leader (and the scorn of younger black militants in the 1960's). However it does. The glue here is the performance of Denzel Washington as the somewhat mysterious hard-driving Northern black intellectual (and friend of Langston Hughes whose work in Spain in the 1930's I have explored elsewhere in this space). Professor Tolson, however, is more than some eccentric college don because he has enlisted in the struggle (or was sent, probably by the Communist or Socialist Party who were both organizing this strata of the agrarian working class in the South at the time) to organize the desperately poor black and white Texas sharecroppers. That story is also a subject worthy of separate discussion at a later time.      As the story unfolds we get a glimpse at black college life in the 1930's with its marching bands, its social life and its pecking orders. What that part of the film looked like was the universality ofthe college experience, except here everyone was black. The mere fact of being in college in the 1930's, at the height of the Great Depression meant that these student were training to be part of the black elite. Along the way, however, a different reality intrudes, as we are also exposed to black life in the South- Jim Crow style, even for W.E.B. Dubois' \\"talented tenth\\".  Two of the most dramatic scenes in the movie are when Reverend James Farmer, Sr., by all accounts an extremely learned man if somewhat distant father, is humbled by some local \\"white trash\\"-for merely driving while black and the seemingly obligatory gratuitous lynching of a black man that the debate team witnessed in its travels. Powerful stuff.      The controversy surrounding the facts, if that is the case, is the question of whether the centerpiece of the 1935-36 debating season, a debate with the august Harvard University team actually occurred and whether the subject matter of this seminal debate was on the virtues and vices of civil disobedience. This would hardly be the first, and will probably not be the last, commercial film to \\"juice up\\" the story in order to create better dramatic tension. In short, to make it a \\"feel good\\" movie for the black and progressive audiences that I assume it was intended to reach. That should not take away from the achievements of this debate team, the courage of Professor Tolson in organizing Southern sharecroppers or the hard reality of \\"lynch law\\" in the Jim Crow South of the 1930's. Well acted, well thought out and well-intended it deserves a careful watching. Do so.

B0012GMWCU|4.0|Muddy Waters. Check. Howlin' Wolf. Check. Koko Taylor. Check. Etta James. Check. And on and on. What do they all have in common? Well, they have all covered the music created by the subject of this review, Willie Dixon. Now Mr. Dixon does not spring to mind when one is discussing the classic blues artists that I have filled this space with over the past year or so. In some senses that is right. But there is always the question, and it is posed most sharply here, about the roots of any musical genre, how it was put together and who did that leg work. Now we are in Mr. Dixon's territory. In reviewing a series of DVDs on the \\"American Folk Blues Concerts\\" that were performed in Europe in the early 1960's I mentioned his name in passing. I have also mentioned his name as the writer in connection with Howlin' Wolf's classic rendition of \\"The Little Red Rooster\\" (later covered by The Rolling Stones) that was my first conscious exposure to electric blues. Here, old Willie is front and center.    Okay, so lets' sum up. Willie wrote great songs, he played a mean bass, and he produced for Chicago's Chess Records some of the most memorable blues recordings of all times. And never got his full recognition or full compensation for that fact. However the treatment of musical artists, and especially blues artists is a subject for another time. Yet, there is no denying his claim as the 'godfather of the blues'. But how does he stand up as a performer in his own right? Well, frankly so-so. On this CD he has a very good back up house band but his vocals fail to carry the effect of his great songs that others have been able to cover so memorably. This is one of those cases where the cover artist is better than the song writer. Still it is nice to see his interpretation of the songs that have been hits for so many others. \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"Spoonful\\", I'm Your Hoochie Goochie Man\\" and the above-mentioned \\"The Little Red Rooster\\". I can hear Muddy and Wolf now. Ya, but Willie, stand tall; you ARE 'the godfather of the electric blues'. Kudos.

0440241413|3.0|Knowing how hugely popular this series of books are and seeing the trailer for the movie, I was really excited to dive into this story. However, I began to cringe after the first couple of chapters. I was unable to connect to the main character, Rebecca. I don't understand that whole shopping thing, and I don't know the difference between Versace and LouisVitton. I kept thinking to myself, \\"How is it possible for someone to be so naive and out of control?\\" I forced myself to finish the book, and I have to say that it does get better after the climax of all her problems. The chemistry between her and her intended through the novel is also intriguing, but it left me really wanting more. Although it bothers me immensely, I will not be reading other books from the Shopaholic series.

B00000G3Q4|4.0|One of the first two dozen DVDs that I purchased was Sam Raimi's \\"The Evil Dead\\"(1983),which was one of my favorite films during my Junior High/Early High School life.    The film is a splatter classic that tells the simple story of a group of five college students who go to an old cabin in the woods and unleash an ancient evil which kills and takes them over,leaving only one survivor...and than something happens....    Raimi brings so much exuberance to the production with a constantly mobile camera,some wild concepts and bizarre special effects that it would be difficult for it not to have become an instant cult hit.The film's gore was so extreme that it featured the most buckets of blood in a film for over a decade until Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive\\"(1990).    In recent years the film has taken on a larger following,which seems more inspired by it's comic third film,\\"Army of Darkness\\",and the original has become overrated.  What keeps the film from being a TRUE genre classic is the fact that the acting and characters are pretty amateurish and the film dosen't exactly have the best plot and will be remade more effectively by Raimi in 1987 as \\"Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn\\".    Still,this is a must see Horror film for fans of the genre and a Grindhouse must have.    This DVD edition features loads of features including two audio commentaries with Director and Producer,Sam Raimia nd Rod Tapert and one with star and B-Movie legend,Bruce Campbell.There are also still galleries,behind the scenes footage and trailers.  The print is pretty good and is offered in full frame,but being this was a low budget film and not a major studio release,that's acceptable.    Still a good DVD release if you can track it down.
B000FGGE68|1.0|Every now and then the critics get one right. Ultraviolet is not a movie, but merely an excuse for a lot of CGI effects. What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it. If you want to watch Milla Jovovich rent The Fifth Element or The Messenger.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I loved this movie, and the underlying dichotomy of honesty and hatred/ lying and love.<br /><br />\\"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off.\\" This statement made by the character Alyce seems a fair film thesis; the characters all lose when they bare their real feelings or 'selves.'<br /><br />It is much easier to be true under a pseudonym. In the film, this philosophy applies to personal relationships as well as on a stripper stage or Internet forum.<br /><br />Truth hurts and here it's used as a weapon or sadomasochism tool.<br /><br />My opinion is that the film offers a refreshing view of raw human nature.

B000HM2NS8|5.0|This is a book explaining that aliens had came here along time ago due to the mass ammount of \\"evidence\\" of extra terrestrial beings, the evidence is bible storys, cave paintings, ancient technology, ancient pyramids, ancient mathematics, the epic of gilgamesh, etc. it is a very exciting book and the documentary is also very good and entertaining, people often challenge the works of this author and claim it is psuedo-archeology and psuedo-astronomy which is true I guess.    But if you are wondering why the title is Chariots of the gods? it is because there is a biblical story where the prophet named Elija and is son Elisha are crossing a river but all of a sudden a chariot of horses comes down from the sky and the sky is full of fire and the chariot takes Elija away from his son Elisha and Elisha begins to cry. this story is related to recent claims of alien abductions and it brings cause for concern..  what is more shocking though, is that chariots of horses that are flying in the sky are mentioned numerous times in ancient texts and also mentioned many more times in the bible...    the bible also talks about giants in the days of their time.. this is true if you read the works of zacharia sitchin claiming that he can read ancient sumerian texts, and they talk abut aliens coming from space and creating humans..
B000BL39GA|5.0|This album is one of my personal favorites from Tupac Shakur, because besides \\"Me Against The World\\" this is Tupacs most personal album. By this time he has released 5 albums and this is his 2nd album in a 'one year' span. This was 2pac's (Makavelis) last album before he died and it was critically acclaimed. The albums lyrics and production is rather dark and one example is the song \\"Hail Mary\\" which is probably the most personal and deepest song on the album. He addresses his city \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" and criticizes society with \\"White Man's World\\" and also deals with his own problems with the song \\"Krazy\\". With all those songs, this album can also be looked as a battle record with songs \\"Bomb First\\",\\"Toss It Up\\" & \\"Life of An Outlaw\\". This is one of 2pac's most balanced albums but the fact that 2Pac managed to create this masterpeice in just one week (hence the 7 Day theory) is just truly amazing. 2Pac's rap career was a blessing to the Hip Hop community, with all of his troubles and personal issues he truly managed to create such a monumental album. Every Hip Hop fan needs to get this album, non of dat mainstream bulls***.

This is a little terse for some, but if you liked HMS Unseen, you'll love this.  It's pretty gut wrenching from almost beginning to end, and nearly non-stop action.<br /><br />If the Afghani's are anything like the Arabs, then I'd say he's pegged them pretty close.  The rite of hospitality is pretty sacred...when you're their friend, then you're their friend...but when you're their enemy....heaven help you.  I think he gave a fair representation of the struggle between the forces of the good, the evil and the misled within the same culture.<br /><br />Obviously all the liberal media types will not enjoy this book, but then again nobody likes a mirror held to their own misdeeds.

1567184855|5.0|I happened to come across Micheal Newton's youtube videos and what he had to say I could not ignore.  This occurred a couple of months after going through the Oprah webcast on Echkart Tolle's book. I knew I had to get the book and read it.  As I read it, there were three passages in the book that when I read them it hit me as such a truth to my soul that in that moment I felt what was like a surge of electrical energy vibrate through my whole being.  This had never occurred to me while reading a book.  Much less three times. I am not saying that the cases in the book and Michael Newton's research are the \\"be all\\" and \\"end all\\" because I have not doubt there is much more insight and re-awakenings to be made, but his work and cases are not to be dismissed.     I have noticed that people are comparing his work with others.  Instead of compare why not have it be an adjunct and a piece of a \\"greater\\" overall work.  It does not stand alone nor does it need to dispute other works.  It has its own inherent value and benefits to each \\"earthly\\" sojourner.     This book took me on a journey to have my first past life regression and then a soul life regression.  I have not been the same since then.  The freedom that my spirit has experience from \\"earthly\\" types of worries, frustrations and confusion is invaluable.  My intuition and growth are increasing exponentially as time goes by.     We are all at different evolutions of our growth (some are still at kinder level, others at a high school level, and then you have the Master level). We need all types of works and teachers. It is ALL good.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It took me a long time to watch this movie after I bought it. Not so much because I don't believe in Global Warming, but because I wasn't in the mood to watch a depressing film about how we are all headed for disaster. I finally got around to watching it last night. Not only is it an engaging, convincing and powerful film, it also didn't leave me in dispair - it left me with hope. Gore not only shows to us laymen irrefutable proof for Climate Change, he shows us that we can still stop this looming catastrophe, this collective crime against humanity and our earth. Time is ticking though. When the ice over the arctic tundras of Canada and later Russia melt, huge amounts of carbon dioxide will be released and Global Warming will basically be put on 'Auto-Pilot'. The time is NOW.    P.S. Why on earth did I see the word 'arguably' in the first sentence of the official Amazon review? As in 'the fate of our planet is arguably hanging in the balance'. Isn't the time for dithering, half-measures and soft words over?

0143105566|4.0|I'm not a fan of spy novels.  \\"Our Man in Havana\\" and a couple by Le Carr&eacute; and you're already at the bottom of the list.  Still, as a tersely-written thriller read on an interminable airplane flight, THE HUMAN FACTOR stands out.  The characters Castle, Davis, Daintry, Percival, Hargreaves, and `Boris' are very well-drawn, their all-too-human motives revealed one by one as are their reactions to events.  Sarah, the African wife of double agent Castle, remains something of a stick figure.  Everything in the setting seems so very English, but it's hard for an American to say if it rings true.  Seedy motives, seedy characters, a very limited life enveloped in secrecy and endless lies--how far from James Bond can you get ?  The Cold War maneuverings all seem so pass&eacute; now, but the tightly-written text will take you past it.<br /><br />Castle has worked in South Africa, fallen in love with an agent (Sarah), but cannot be with her due to the Race Laws of the apartheid regime in the 1970s.  A kindly Communist smuggles the woman into Mozambique where Castle marries her, thus ensuring his transfer back to the UK.  They return with a child, but it isn't Castle's.  In return for saving his wife, Castle agrees to become a KGB agent on the Africa desk in the British intelligence network.  A mole is suspected, but the wrong man is bumped off surreptitiously by an agency doctor who wants to try out a new method of assassination by chemical.  What ultimately happens to Castle is the stuff of the last part of the novel.  It's a page turner for those of you surfers who dig spy fiction: top drawer style.  No sex, no graphic violence, no settings of great luxury.  You get whiskey and smoked trout, a bit of port, and walking the dog on a cold day in the London suburbs.  Greene presents his usual sad view of human nature, but despite my wish to believe otherwise, maybe it's accurate.

0525951113|5.0|When Michael Crichton passed away in 2008, it was with great sadness that this prolific and entertaining writer would not be sharing his tales any longer. The man who rekindled the phrase, \\"Once upon a time...\\", with books like Rising Sun, Prey, State of Fear, Sphere, and the unforgettable Jurassic Park books, single-handedly rewrote the techno-thriller genre.<br /><br />With Daniel Suarez, we have someone who fills Mr. Crichton's literary shoes quite nicely. With the depth and breadth and understanding of what makes a good story tick, Suarez tackles the byzantine world of hackers, the Internet, and cyber-security. He makes everything understandable to the layperson, keeps the momentum moving, and all this in his first novel! (Which is pronounced Day*mon when used as a computer term).<br /><br />The plot crackles along, the dialog is snappy and never sounds contrived, and the characters are fleshed out in a believable manner. As I read the story, I couldn't help but think how much I missed this Crichton-esque storytelling. It's no easy task to write a white-knuckle thriller, but Suarez has accomplished it with apparent ease.<br /><br />If you don't like techno-thrillers, don't let the subject matter frighten you away. He makes it as understandable as Crichton did explaining how to reconstitute dinosaurs from amber-encased mosquitoes. In fact, I would classify this novel as an old-fashioned seat-of-your-pants page-turner.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to his next novel, and the one after that, for it would seem that like Crichton, and Dan Brown after that, we have a new author who will give us years of entertainment.

B0006PV5VC|5.0|Legend has it that conductor Fritz Reiner had a very foul temperament. I'm sure there must be some truth to this, because what we have here is one of the best performances of \\"Scheherazade\\" I've ever heard. Like all great conductors, Reiner was had magnificent control over his orchestra. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra plays with a lot of passion and anyone with ears can hear this in this performance.<br /><br />This is a beautiful performance and should be essential listening to anyone interested in classical music. There is also a great version of Stravinsky's \\"Song of the Nightingale\\" that is noteworthy.<br /><br />I would wager that Reiner's \\"Scheherazade\\" is one of the finest I've heard so far. Highly recommended.

I have tried just about every cupcake recipe in this book! My personal favorites are the green tea cupcakes and the pistachio rosewater cupcakes. People always ask, \\"what do you eat?\\" when they learn that I am vegan. I tell them \\"I make the best cupcakes\\" and to make it even better, I take cupcakes with me to just about every event I go to. I even won over a cattle rancher once with the green tea cupcakes! These are just amazing. Don't be intimidated by some of the fancy cupcake terminology (i.e. fancy frosting and decorating) it will all make sense in time. These lovely vegan chefs give you even the most basic cupcake recipes to start with then you will become a cupcake maniac like me! Next stop ... weight watchers :-)
B0000793Z9|5.0|Popularly, Simple Minds is inextricably linked to the '80s, what with their hit, \\"Don't You Forget (About Me),\\" born from one of the very most iconic films of the era, \\"The Breakfast Club.\\" But those in the know who appreciated the brooding sound of that single understand that they'd laid it all down in perhaps unsurpassable form in the nine tracks of which New Gold Dream is comprised.     Free of the teenage angst of said single, NGD is a cohesive series of Jim Kerr's at times soaringly-poetic meditations and laments woven into a very well-crafted musical dreamscape tapestry courtesy of the core members and guests, including Herbie Hancock on \\"Hunter and the Hunted.\\" And while the album did spawn a couple of UK singles hits (\\"Promised You a Miracle\\" and \\"Glittering Prize\\"), these are mature-sounding songs that fit in well with their less danceable album mates.    In short, this is an album with the goods (I believe I'm echoing another reviewer, here) to haunt lovers of the shoegazer, dreampop, new wave, goth, psychedelica, ethereal, and ambient genres. I listened to NGD endlessly when I first got it, circa '84/'85, and still love every track two decades later. I consider it one of the very finest of my 300+ album collection.    So far as the remastered version goes, the result is differences that by and large I appreciate. The tracks now have a crisper sound, both in high-end detail and low-end punch. I'v always found the layering of the original recording to be of excellent quality, and am not sure there is much room for improvement, here. I do differ with one other reviewer here regarding whether Kerr's vocals should have been brought more forward into the mix than was opted for; I find the vocal presentation to be true to original sound and, I'm sure, intent. Purists (such as myself) may find the tweaking done with the surreal, anthemic title song - including the lopping off of a minute of it(!) - an act of heresy, so be forewarned. Overall, though, I find the update of this stellar recording to be worthy of the purchase price.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Magical!    This is truly a work of genius. Like The Wizard of Oz, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (the book, at least), and the song, Puff the Magic Dragon, it takes us into another world, strange and frightening, yet oddly familiar. And when we leave it, we are a little sad and eager to return.      The film is full of mysteries (Thank you, Tsuyoshi, for helping with some of them) and difficult to understand, and that is perhaps part of its appeal. Fundamentally it is, I think, a coming-of-age story, with Chihiro forced to meet great challenges without the support of her parents for the first time.     Indeed, Chihiro's parents have in a sense abandoned her by indulging themselves to excess. Therein lies one of the film's lessons: ultimately we must rely on ourselves. Her parents illustrate another theme of the film: Attempts to classify people as good or evil are bound to fail. Everyone, however good,  is capable of vile things (the mindless gluttony of her parents, the violence of Haku), and those who seem irredeemably evil (the dangerous No Face and the cruel Yubaba) are quite capable of good. This is much closer to reality than the cookie cutter figures of so many more traditional films, including those intended solely for adults, and of so many  politicians and talk show hosts who define and dismiss our enemies as \\"evil doers.\\"     A related message is illustrated by the stinking river god: We are as we are chiefly because of our environment, which includes how we are treated by others. When the  abuses  of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq came to light, many people excused the actions of our troops by saying, \\"There are a few rotten apples in every barrel.\\" The eminent social psychologist Philip Zimbardo replied, \\"It isn't the apples that are rotten, it's the barrel.\\" It is no coincidence that it is the gentle, respectful Chihiro, not the powerful and violent Yubaba, who tames No Face.     Some parts of the film may frighten the youngest children. I remembera nephew who at age ten always closed his eyes when the Wicked Witch of the West appeared in Oz. But we cannot forever close our eyes to the things that frighten us, and films such as Spirited Away help us, children and adult alike, open our eyes. That's  partly why we call them magical.

0930289234|5.0|I never was really interested in comics and graphic novels until I took a class on them. The first graphic novel we read was Watchmen. I have always been a fan of Batman, but I never had heard of Watchmen. It was a great story, and now ranks up there with Batman, for me. It's not too fantastic to believe, yet it still has elements of super-hero comics. I found the novel extremely thrilling and suspenseful. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you have not read any comics or graphic novels. It offers another thrilling super-hero type story in addition to the classic Batman, Superman, and Spider-man.

My only complaint is the release schedule on these books - I just can's wait!
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|A tough choice whether to give this 2 or 3 stars. It really is a very poor movie. Yet, as other reviewers have said it is a guilty pleasure so in the end I just gave it the benefit of the doubt. The plus points are mainly Morgan Freeman who gives typically understated performance that enhances the film enormously.<br /><br />Jolie and McAvoy aren't bad either, but where the film is let down is the soundtrack. A deadly serious score which really doesn't work for a film based on a comic. If you suspend believe completely some of the action sequences are quite well done. As for bending bullits around objects by swinging your arm... well I'm not convinced.<br /><br />Really this should be so much better than say The Transporter films. But it isn't because those films don't take themselves seriously. Still for a mindless hour and 3/4 there are worse films out there.

While all musicians deliver a stunning performance, special mention must go to Sharon den Adel who produces a tour de force for over two hours.

0743454537|4.0|\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a heart-wrenching novel about a family of five struggling as sixteen-year old Kate fights kidney cancer. The plot revolves around Kate's disease and the extreme actions her parents take in an attempt to keep her alive. Kate's parents have a third child, Anna, in an attempt to solve Kate's need for a rare blood type. After continually giving blood, Anna was further used as Kate's bone marrow donor, followed by her parent's requesting she donate a kidney.     This story offers a look into people's lives as they deal with an ongoing life threatening tragedy. I also presents complex themes that are likely to be increasingly common as medical technology offers more options for humans.     Here are what I found to be  important and interesting themes presented in \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\" How difficult parenting can be, especially with a child who has a life- threatening disease. How legal and moral decisions are not always consistent. How far should a person be pushed and their life compromised in an effort to help another person. How people can sometimes place a higher value on life than on quality of life    A prospective reader should consider that \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" has an overall sad tone. There tends to be one challenge and troublesome event or decision followed by another. Reader's looking for an up-lifting, cheerful book should pass on reading this book.  Though I found the book to originally present important and thought provoking themes, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" did not briefly take over my life. It never became a book I was addicted to reading continuously.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a representation of the life of John Adams on a grand scale.  HBO has produced some other ambitious projects that were well done, and this production will take its place beside their previous endeavors.  Paul Giamatti BECOMES one of our founding fathers, and the rest of the casting is outstanding as well - including Laura Linney as the stalwart Abigal Adams.<br /><br />While the series is in seven parts, it still glosses over Adam's life, sticking to the most salient aspects.  Indeed, each one of the seven sections could have been sub-divided into seven sections by themselves as the miniseries covers so many crucial aspects of the early days of this country - including the lead-up to the Revolutionary war.  Episode 1 picks up on the infamous evening of the Boston massacre, and the rest of the sections carry through until the end of Adams' life.<br /><br />While I knew in a generic sense a lot of what was presented in this series, the DVDs did a terrific job of elucidating many of the subtle details which I was unaware of.  It is a big budget production and I actually felt like one of the colonists who existed some 200yrs ago.<br /><br />This DVD set is highly recommended for history buffs & non-history buffs alike.  It is the story of the first vice president & the 2nd president of the United States.  As such, it's important to all the denizens of the U.S.  I can't think of a better way to spend President's Day than to view this one!
B001DE29SS|5.0|Those of you who may be a fan of Robert Downey, Jr. from Iron Man and/or Tropic Thunder should see him in his greatest role as Charlie Chaplin.  Chaplin is a wonderfully nuanced portrayal of one of the true geniuses of cinema with an all-star cast which included Anthony Hopkins, Dan Aykroyd, Diane Lane, James Woods, Geraldine Chaplin (playing her actual grandmother), Marisa Tomei, a very young David Duchovny, and Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  But since he is at the center of essentially every frame, the movie's success rides on Downey's performance of perhaps the greatest movie icon ever, and Downey succeeds brilliantly.  Whether emulating Chaplin's physical pratfalls or showing his underlying passion and commitment to his art, to his compassion for humanity, to the real life pathos of his love life, Downey's performance is one for the ages.  The movie's memorable ending shows Chaplin's triumphant return to America in 1972 and being awarded an honorary Academy Award while showing Peter Bogdanovich's homage to the real Chaplin.

0061537934|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is the story of the life of Enzo, a lab mix with the mind of a philosopher and the heart of a human.  The story is written from Enzo's point of view, and through his eyes we watch as his owner Denny, lives his life.  Enzo, Denny's faithful companion, is present when Denny falls in love with Eve, and watches as they get married and start a family.  We feel Enzo's joy when Zoe is born, and we feel his love and protectiveness as he lives each day with his family.  Seeing through Enzo's eyes, we witness scenes and gain insight that others in the story do not have -- who worries about what they do or say in front of a dog? -- but we also experience his limitations; Enzo can not grasp things, turn doorknobs, or, no matter how much he wants to, speak.  We also watch, feeling Enzo's helplessness, as Eve becomes ill then unexpectedly dies, plunging Denny into a three-year custody battle over Zoe with Eve's parents.<br /><br />Stein does an excellent job of crafting the narration and description to reflect not only Enzo's intelligence and soul, but also his inherent \\"dogness\\".  Stein's work is quite original in this regard, and his prose has a fullness of development and fluidity that gives Enzo a necessary, believable realism.  Enzo's character is very well developed and three dimensional, which contrasts with the flatness of the other characters.  However, the flatness is appropriate, given the relationship between Enzo and everyone else.  The flatness reflects the mostly one-way relationship between Enzo and others. It reflects the limitations of what Enzo can see and know about them.<br /><br />There are strong themes of loyalty, determination, and hope despite seemingly overwhelming odds running throughout the book.  And the details and discussion about racing and how the principles of racing can give insight into a way to live one's life is a nice counterpoint to the main thrust of the plot.  The book also suggests interesting possibilities about the intelligence of dogs.  It will make you take a second look at your dog and wonder just how much he or she does understand about your life.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful read. If you have a dog, or even if you don't, I recommend that you read this book. It is inspiring.elligence of dogs.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|....aren't supposed to sing this repertoire this well. Well...there's Jane Monheit, but, great as Jane is, Renee is the new head of the list. (Diana Krall is a pretty white girl, but not young; Madeleine Peyroux is young and white). This record took too long to make, but I forgive whoever slowed it up...it is FABULOUS. Yes, I like gorgeous redheads, but that's irrelevant with singing this good.....<br /><br />As to specifics...13 tracks...4 original compositions, of which I liked \\"Midnight in Austin, Texas\\" the best...9 old standards, that every girl and her sister has done before (some more than others, naturally). Well...it's like hearing them for the first time. \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\"...\\"When I Fall in Love\\"...\\"Ain't We Got Fun\\"...Renee makes them her own. With Jazz, that's OK...in fact, it's the idea. (If Anna Netrebko did that in \\"Lucia\\", it would be a different matter). The Hoagy Carmichael/Johnny Mercer standard \\"Skylark\\", the title cut, has been done over and over, but NEVER better (the late Eileen Farrell did it for Reference Recordings ~20 years ago, but she was of an entirely different order of magnitude). Ray Charles recorded \\"Hit The Road Jack\\" at least 45 years ago; it's written for a man, but Renee did fine, and was smart enough not to mess with the lyrics.<br /><br />If you get the idea that I believe this to be a REALLY special album, you're right. In a couple of tracks, including \\"Stars Fell...\\", the sound mimicked a 1930s broadcast...that's OK, it wasn't overdone. I do see the earlier reviewer's caveat about the engineering; my sub-woofer got a work-out. That aside, this is one of the greatest Jazz albums I've ever heard. (Yes, Diana, I still love you). The little girl from her self-titled recording is growing up very nicely. Don't fail to grab this....ten stars, at least.
0765318741|4.0|In fact the book was out before the movie, by some 60 years!  I am Legend is a short story of classic horror from the 50's.  So short in fact to say much of the story will give away lots of the novella.<br /><br />The current cover showing Will Smith from the movie I am Legend does this book a disservice.  The two stories are not the same beyond the basic survivalist premise, and the movie ending is nothing like the book ending - I love the book's ending MUCH more, such a great hook.<br /><br />The novella is well worth the reading if you want a little horror thrill from the 50's and can be read in a single sitting.  Also when you pick this book up you are actually getting two stories; so when I say short, I am Legend is short, make no mistake.
1591396190|4.0|The book arrived in a timely manner. There were quite a few pages that were dog-eared, but other than that, it was in good condition. I would use this supplier again.
B001CB2A1I|4.0|This story consists of three major plots and unless you pay close attention, you will get lost.<br /><br />It is a brilliant love/horror story though, and who would expect anything less from Stephen King.<br /><br />Through Lisey's eyes, we are taken back to her relationship with her husband, who has passed away.  While cleaning out her husband's office and going through papers, Lisey finds herself being stalked which leads to dangerous encounters.<br /><br />We also find out about Lisey taking care of her mentally ill sister, Amanda.  Amanda helps her and hangs around while Lisey cleans out her husbands office.<br /><br />As Lisey remembers her husband by clues left from Scott - her husband, this embarks Lisey on a journey of fantasy and complete horror.
0385335989|5.0|This is book 4 in the series and is excellent.  A long read and very meaty so don't expect to finish quickly but it's worth the effort.  I loved book 1 and 2.  Book 3 (Voyager) wasn't my favorite but I am back in thrall with this one. Claire and Jamie are such rich characters and now we've added daughter, Brianna and the man in her life, Roger.  These latest time travelers, Brianna and Roger, introduce an exciting new dimension and add new perceptions of the 1700's as seen through the eyes of a throughly modern and well-educated couple.  If you like history, if you like rich characters, if you like love stories that aren't all mush but have ups and downs just like real life, then you will love this book!

B00129H7VS|5.0|I got BOB from Amazon on Blu-Ray. Bottom line: If you are even reading this page, you MUST buy it. It is simply stunning. On Blu-Ray, the gritty, realistic feel of the camera, along with filters and colors that are used to film BOB just pop out at you. This isn't going to be crystal clear in the sense that Wall-E or some other animated movies are clear in Blu-Ray. This is clear in the sense that you really feel what the director was trying to achieve with the shots.    The sound IS something from out of this world. Watching it in DTS Master Audio (lossless) was a serious treat. If nothing else, buy this to show off your home theater by turning on the Battle of the Bulge episode.     As far as the quality of the show, nothing competes. You get attached to the characters, you feel their joys and their pains. You feel like a member of Easy Company.     This is a must own for anyone who even considers themselves fans of some sort of media.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|a influential horror classic. while the acting is atrocious, this is one of the most visually surreal films i have ever seen. the colors, sets and camera work all combine with a dizzying effect of unease and sheer \\"creepiness\\"- there isnt another word for it. this film is just plain creepy, and so good!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The acting by Heath Ledger was great. I was skeptical about him winning an Oscar based on sentimentality but he deserves it. It seemed he took Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and raised to a new level. Definitely a don't miss movie.
B000KRNG5E|2.0|total non-sense. my least favorite of the three mothers triolgy because it really makes no sense at all. there is no main character and just one weird situation after the next. visually its great and it has the classic Argento sensibility, but its in no way a rewarding film.

0783114893|5.0|If you loved Hitchcock's Psycho then this is a must see for you. Many movies of this caliber tend to be too theatrical and become scenes of blood and gore. This movie has more than one 'shower scene.' While many people are murdered in this movie and you know it wasn't pleasant, you don't get to see the blood and gore.  You are never quite sure what took place, it is in your mind and perhaps that is what makes this so scary.  I know there has been a remake of this movie but it doesn't even come close to this one - from what I heard and read. I didn't see the new movie myself. If you want a real challenge, try to watch this movie alone, on a dark rainy night and see what happens. If you don't think you can cut it then get some friends together who enjoy psychological thrillers and prepare to be thrilled in ways you never expected.  Leadie Jo Flowers
B001FW2R5I|5.0|I've enjoyed listening to music shared by Keane because it somehow seemed to create a certain nostalgia in an unexplainable way. Whether it was due to a nod toward the best of the 70's, 80's, and today I couldn't say, but Keane certainly has a knack for writing intriguing lyrics and music.<br /><br />While my favorite album is still the album titled \\"Hopes and Fears\\", with \\"Under the Iron Sea\\" coming in a close second, this still has a great feel to it.<br /><br />They somehow seem to have proven that they can embrace different, yet somewhat recent musical eras, while creating a sense of reminiscence. With slow rifts, engaging guitars, and pianos smoothing in with other instruments and vocals, they certainly seem to have a natural talent for music and lyrics that are pensive in nature. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did.
0385340990|5.0|A delightful combination of laugh-out-loud humor but with a sobering, thought-provoking, and informative slant on an unfamiliar part of the world.  It is a post war look at how Guernsey was impacted by WWII and a gripping story of its effect on lives that are beautifully and compassionately presented.  One of the best and most entertaining books I have found in a long time.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is SO enjoyable to listen to!  The \\"energy\\" is contageous!  I'm so impressed with all the actors' singing (especially Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep).  There are cruel reviews re:  Pierce Brosnan going from \\"James Bond\\" to this.  His songs were fine (and just as enjoyable as the others).  Whatever happened to \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\".  I applaud Pierce for having the \\"guts\\" to put himself \\"out there\\" to do something different!

B001M5UDGS|4.0|I thought this was one of the campiest \\"movies\\" I've seen in a long time, and I loved it. Nathan Fillion and Neil Patrick Harris worked well as \\"hero\\" and \\"villan\\" and Felicia Day was an excellent \\"love interest\\". Hated the ending, but that's Joss Whedon for you! Either way, you gotta see this!

B0000024WN|5.0|Pearl is one of those albums that deserves to linger on for generations to come. My mother had it on LP back in the day, and I have it myself on LP and CD. Every track is worth listening to. This title was released in February, 1971, a mere few months after Janis Joplin passed away from an accidental heroin overdose in October, 1970. Her vocals are excellent, and they will help to brighten your day. The album starts off with Move Over, then moves to Cry Baby (two of Janis' trademark tunes). Next comes A Woman Left Lonely, which has a dramatic sadness to it. Track 4, which is Half Moon, is a great soulful rocker, and another one of my favorite titles on this album. Buried Alive in the Blues is another great song, even though it is an instrumental. Several sources have stated that Janis died on the day that she was scheduled to supply her vocals to this song. Whatever lyrics she had in mind, or whatever soulful wails or shouts she was going to add to this song is something Janis herself would only know about and remains a mystery to fans of this lady's work and this album. Buried Alive.... is a great tune worth listening to. My Baby is another great tune. Me and Bobby McGee is another one of Janis' signature songs as well. It was stated that she had recorded this song just before she left us. A memorable tune that will never be forgotten. Next comes Mercedes Benz. This one has Janis singing, but no instruments. It was stated that this song was a first take, but the producers felt that it was worth adding to this album. Before singing, she says: \\"I'd like to do a song of great social and political import. It goes like this.\\" and she slaps something to accompany her singing. When she's finished, she says, \\"That's it,\\" and laughs. That is wonderful. Trust Me is soulful, as well as Get It While You Can. An album worth having. God has Janis Joplin in heaven now, but thanks to her enormous talent, her music and voice will always be here with us. Someone said that this albumwill forever remain unfinished, but since its release in early '71, it is a finished album. God bless you Janis!
B000ESST6U|5.0|I love Mozartoperas. And I love Haendeloperas. In general productions of those early-history operas are old fashioned, stiff, characters are slow moving, the librettos do not make matters better.  Now this production is different and really outstanding. Although again the story is complicated and Kindergarten-style there is big action on stage with fighting scenes, erotic sparkling and even a quite intense half-rape scene between a bass and an alto voice (!). The singers are outstanding, Haendel for sure listened from cloud 13 and made it rain over Glyndebourne (tears). The really strange thing: after having seen the whole thing a few times its not just one singer that stands over the whole production, everyone gave his best. And the MUSIC!
0545128285|5.0|Great book for anyone into the Harry Potter series.  Also a good bedtime story book for kids even too young for the other books.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway & John Huston star in \\"Chinatown,\\" a movie filled with intrigue, suspense and drama. All these ingredients make for great cinema and \\"Chinatown\\" delivers on all cylinders. Huston's role is really more of a cameo, but he acquits himself well as always. Classic film. Ironically, Nicholson's character says a line which would be said to him  by Lieutenant Daniel Kafee (Tom Cruise) in \\"A Few Good Men\\": \\"I want the truth!\\" This film SHOULD NOT have been rated R, but PG. It only has mild language, some violence and brief nudity. Minor note: Look out for Roman Polanski in a cameo.

1416562605|4.0|You know what to expect from a novel about India, right?  The saffron scented air; the orange and pink silks; the jangling stacks of gold bangles; the mystical mists rising off mountains; the hair-raising squalor juxtaposed against unbelievable architectural spendor . . . .  Well, you'll find little of that here, in this fast-moving, highly cynical tale of an opportunistic self-made man who rises from the muck of a small Indian village to the entrepeneurial paradise of Banglalore with very few regrets along the way.    The depictions of poverty and filth are familiar from other novels about India; you can be sure that any mention of a stream, river, lake or washpan will lead directly into a lingering description of the water's fecal content.  It's the descriptions of the rich that surprise; rather than living out a Raj-era fantasy of the Indian good life, the rich in Adiga's Delhi live in high rise apartments furnished with rented white couches, consume pizza and counterfeit English booze, and listen to Sting and Eminen on the CD player.  In a hilariously ironic detail, even their New Age music is imported; the chill-out music of choice is not Ravi Shankar, but Enya.    The book is a highly entertaining page turner, and the narrator's voice is witty and distinctive.  In the end, however, I found the book to be lacking in depth.  Rather than fully fleshed out characters, the book relies on caricatures, and the political critique is totally lacking in nuance.  It's good in the way a Carl Hiaasson novel is good; it's a fun caper novel with colorful characters in a highly distinctive setting.  But Booker worthy?  Not to me.

B000F3UAFC|5.0|Helen Hunt plays the role of Mrs. Erlynne, who lives off of other women's husbands. The movie opens in New York City during the 30's and we see this gorgeous and self assured femme fatale no longer welcomed by society because of the danger she represents. The credit she once had, provided by the rich and famous is no longer available but she wants to move to new territory and is forced to sell her jewelry to have enough money to buy passage to travel to the Amalfi Coast, the region of Italy's coastline located south of Naples.     The beautiful settings of Amalfi, Positano and Ravello make this movie a cinematographic wonder. The shots of this world renowned stretch of mountainous coastline are breathtaking and we could not help but want to visit the picturesque villages, the beautiful villas that cling to the cliffs as if designed to become part of a portrait.    We get to walk with the actors through the streets of these fishing villages and we join them as they purchase their lunch from the fresh catch of the day. Mrs. Eflynne has apparently set her sight on a newly married Robert Windermere, played by Mark Umbers.    Meg Windermere, played by Scarlett Johansson is portrayed as naïve, completely in love with her husband and incapable of doing anything to jeopardize her marriage. But when her husband starts to visit Mrs. Eflynne at her villa the local gossips become convinced that they are involved in a torrid affair and they become the talk of the town.    John Standing delivers an outstanding performance as Dumby, the high society wealthy Lord Darlington, twice-divorced and reluctant to ever marry again, and yet, he is so smitten by Mrs. Eflynne that he proposes matrimony to the \\"American\\" woman that every woman despises and every man admires.     This is one of those few movies that took us by surprise as the plot twists and turns, and rather than revealing it to you, we simply recommend seeing it. If you have ever traveled through Italy, this movie will remind you of the great natural beauty of Amalfi, Ravello, Sorrento and Rome. Gorgeous attire, elegant settings, delightful performances and delicious give and take by the men... Don't miss it!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is a beautiful film. It uses the program 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' as a metaphor to tell the life of an Indian boy born into the shantytowns of Mumbai.    The film does a good job in portraying the poverty of these places, although some who know of this poverty may say it does not go far enough. However, even in this poverty the film provides a moment of emotional power where you are horrified, shocked but also hilariously amused when the boy meets his Bollywood actor idol.    There are also disturbing scenes where the boy, his brother and their friend are duped by a 'professional begging outfit'. If you ever see street children/adults in the Indian subcontinent again, you will never look on them in the same light.     The film also provides a wider critique of how these people are looked upon by the richer/more powerful classes. It also provides a powerful critique of 'modern India' which the trio inevitably get swept up in. Modern India seems to be more about superficial appearances rather than true development.    The film looks at India's class prejudices, communal violence, poverty and alleged modernisation. Some Indians, who are very patriotic, despise this film because of it. This is a shame because the film could be used as a springboard for the discussion of these issues. The film is not patronising to India, nor does it preach and it certainly does not practise escapism.    For me, the childhood actors really were the stars of the film. They did a fantastic job of maintaining their childhood exuberance despite all that was going on around them.    Ultimately, the film has a happy ending, but you may feel this happiness is tainted by what has gone on prior to that point.        p.s. I hope the child actors in this film are given a real opportunity to escape the poverty that they have come from, or otherwise the film makers are just as bad as those they portray in the film. From what I have read, they have not really made an attempt to bring the children out of poverty. I encourage people to write to the makers to register their opinions on this.
B001O6W9QC|1.0|a brutally not funny movie about a not funny subject, lame, a disappointing effort by Stiller
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Some of the people watching this film will (hopefully) be very keen to discern the scientific basis and evidence behind man-made global warming. However, this film only contains about two minutes of science and the rest is a hagiographic account of Al Gore plus some Apple product placement.    The two minutes of science is 'Hi my name is Troy McClure-esque'. In fact, you could even argue that it is insulting to the viewer. It is then assumed from this piffle that you will accept man made global warming as scientific fact and the film continues with Al Gore's lecture.    I watched the rebuttal of this film ('The Great Global Warming Swindle') prior to this and whilst I am aware of the fact that some of the contributors claimed they had been quoted out of context (possibly due to fear of a backlash) this film mentions actual scientific points which were never mentioned in Gore's film, although presumably many of these issues did exist when his film was made.    The bottom line is that even if you believe global warming is man made that this film makes an incredibly poor attempt in proving this.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I was totally taken by surprise when watching this movie.  A friend gave it to me about two years ago and I refused to watch it because I wasn't interested in another low budget gay movie about a drag queen. Well, I must say that I am rather sad that I waited so long to finally watch it.  The reason I finally watched it is because I was wondering what other movies the fabulous Michael Pitt had done.  Though Pitt does a fine job, it was John Cameron Mitchell that kept me glued to the screen.  The songs were not only entertaining, but down right electrifying.  The story itself was even different, which I loved.  I have since found out that this was originally an off-Broadway play.  I wish I had seen it.  This movie was quite the surprise and I am glad I finally watched it.  I will definitely watch it again.
0385339089|4.0|What more can I say about this book that hasn't been wrote in some of the other reviews?  I want to echo the incredible way that John is able to build characters that you have a relationship with.  I felt the pain and somehow related to his story and why he had to seek safety in his lawyer.<br /><br />This story kept you wondering what was around the next corner and how it would end.  John does not let you down with a sad ending, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Near the end I thought he was going to let the Mafia have its day and make for a real twist and ending that you would not expect (in fact I was rooting for the bad guy for some reason).  Anyway, the family fly's off save and sound; as safe as the FBI can keep you.<br /><br />Hope I did not give too much away.  You will enjoy the quick and easy read that just may keep you up at night.  Save some time, because you will want to quickly finish this book and see what happens.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|Amazing. One of the most fun movies I've seen in a long time. Characters you love to hate, great monsters keep things moving at just the right pace. Another one of my favorite movies done yet again by Frank Darabont. The black and white version really does make a difference.

This was an absolutely delightful book. A must-read for every teenage diva and young woman who hasn't yet learned the basics of money management (and those of us who have grown up and remember what it was like to be young and stupid). I haven't seen the movie yet, but I'm sure I'll be disappointed. It will be next to impossible to capture this adorable heroine. This is what reading for pleasure is all about. Loved it!

B001DHXT6G|3.0|I have been waiting for a long time to purchase the original Star Trek on DVD. I've been watching and waiting for the price to drop, and finally I was able to find it at a reasonable price. I'm absolutely thrilled to be watching this show again after so many pleasant childhood memories. The remastered editions with the added special effects make it even better. This show triggers many happy memories growing up, and I don't regret the purchase at all.    However, the packaging for this set leaves alot to be desired. Upon first glance, the sets look great. Then I picked it up and began opening it only to find tiny shards of plastic rattling around inside. Luckily this was only for the first season, 2 and 3 seem intact for the most part. The outer casing just seems way to brittle for the price we are paying. Inside the clam shell case, the discs are in individual thin plastic sleeves that are hinged together. This hinged device rests inside a cardboard holder. The discs themselves do not have episode titles on them, so you have to refer to these little cards that come with the set to find the episode you want to watch. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the packaging...I would have been satisfied if they'd packaged it in the thin pack boxes like most other t.v. shows do nowadays. These sets look great on the shelf, they just needed to be alot sturdier.    At the end of the day, I'm glad I bought this set, as it will most likely be the last time it's released on standard DVD format. I'm just not ready to spend the large amount of money it will take to upgrade my extensive DVD collection to Blu-Ray just yet. I'll wait 2-3 more years until the prices are more manageable. It's just a pleasure to revisit this show again, it's like an old friend you haven't seen in years.     I recommend this set for the show and the new special effects only, not for the packaging.

It can be applied to both work and home b/c your strengths are your strengths no matter where you are or who you interact with. The quiz/test is different in structure than others I've taken, but yields more accurate results. And the way the book itself is put together, it makes it easy to familiarize yourself with your strengths and why, as well as others around you. I would highly suggest this book/test to colleagues, members of work groups - people that find themselves needing to relate to others around them more efficiently.

1594489505|4.0|Very well written, but sad tale of life in Afghanistan.  The word pictures are wonderful.  You can believe that you are part of the life in this war-torn land.  There is love, sacrifice, anger, and tragedy depicted in the lives of women.  This is a fitting complement to the author's first novel, \\"Kite Runner.\\"
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Wanted is grittier than the Matrix, but you get the feeling that you've seen it all before.  Office drone is plucked from his cubical cell life by a hot chick who drives almost as well as she shoots.  African-American leader speaks in riddles and sends our reluctant hero into battle.  Lots of killing without consequence. Lots of violent eye candy.  Awakenings, betrayals, redemption.  And wire work in place of a plot.  It will entertain you if you have the stomach for it, just don't expect anything new.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|While some may think of this movie as humorous entertainment or a bizarre horror flick, it is really not so different from the state of some youth today. If you carefully examine the news, you can see that ultraviolence is no longer just the subject of fiction, it is real.    Note, this DVD had an important scene removed, in which the pretty girl murders an older rapist.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|1. Candy Shop-7/10- Not a very good way to kick off the album... an under-produced track that still sounds like a demo, with a crappy ending from Pharrell, who appears WAY TOO MUCH on this album. Althought the lyrics are kinda fun and it was a cool performance on the tour, this one is just OK to me.  2. 4 Minutes(Feat. Justin Timberlake and Timbaland)-8/10- Released as the lead single, this song is fun and has a fantastic video. Good for the clubs and will keep you on your feet. Only big problem is that you hear more of J.T. and Timb. than Madonna, so it kinda sounds like she's the guest on her own song!  3. Give It 2 Me-10/10- Here's where the album starts getting really good... this one is very club-friendly and is full of sexy lyrics set to a fantastic beat. Madonna delivers the classic line \\"if it's against the law, arrest me- if you can handle it, undress me\\" while Pharrell actually gives a pretty good little interlude \\"get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop\\" which will put anyone who loves dance in a trance!  4. Heartbeat-10/10- The fun continues with another club-friendly track that will have anyone jumping... not only is this the perfect dance song, the way Madonna sings is great and the \\"see my booty get down\\" part actually comes off to be really nice!  5. Miles Away-10/10- Beautiuful, gorgeous, amazing! Very personal lyrics by Madonna about her long distance relationship with her now ex-husband Guy Ritchie. A big highlight on the album!  6. She's Not Me-9/10- Great, '80's sounding breakup track with catchy lyrics! AWESOME on the S&S Tour! Could have used a little more substance, but oh well...  7. Incredible- 9/10- One of those songs that you either love or hate... personally, I love it. I think it's awesome how it constantly changes throughout it's very long run... like, it starts off as a raggae-sounding jam, then starts with a more rockier edge, and ends with a techno-ish breakdown with Madge and Pharrell singing about a party back and forth toeach other. I think this is one of those really good kinda hidden tracks that everyone always forgets about. It's a good bit repetitive, but when you're listening to the song you just mostly overlook that error.  8. Beat Goes On(Feat. Kanye West)-10/10- My personal fav on the album... at first, I didn't think Madonna+Kanye would work, but hell, it did! VERY dance-heavy and fun, and amazing to hear live. Even Kanye's rap is brilliance! REALLY needs to be a single!  9. Dance 2night- 7/10- I don't really have a comment on this one... it's OK and kinda fun for some people, but overall it's just too ordinary- like, anyone could have came along and done this song...  10. Spanish Lesson- 2/10- The worst song on here... she's not even saying those Spanish words correctly! It's ridiculous! The beat is fun but other than that this song sucks... why she did it on the tour, I'll never know...  11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You- 10/10- BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING, HAUNTING, PERFECT!!! I love this song sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!! It was gorgeous live and just... wow, this song is incredible!  12. Voices- 8/10- This is a good way to end the album with the bells chiming, but overall this one is just OK- I only listen to it every now and then.  So yeh, HC isn't as good as COTDF, but it's definitely pleasing!

0066620996|5.0|This book by Jim Collins results of a study of several companies which made a sustained quantitative and qualitative jump over a period of at least 15 years. The framework it describes covers six core common principles of these companies: Level 5 Leadership; First Who... Then What; Confront The Brutal Facts; The Hedgehog Concept; A Culture of Discipline; and Technology Accelerators. It's interesting to notice how some the referred companies have developed since the time the book was written, such as : Gillete (bought by Procter & Gamble); Fannie Mae (hit by the subprime) and Circuit City (filed for bankruptcy). Nevertheless, while I don't believe that companies can be forever great, I do believe that the principles outline in this book are timeless. Highly recommended - together with Built to Last from the same author.<br /><br />30/Jul/2009 Update: One can not read this book in the right context and perspective without reading [[ASIN:0743291263 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]] - so far the best business book I've ever read!

0375704027|3.0|I read this book with much anticipation because of hearing that this is the book that put Murakami on the map, so to speak. I found it a tad disappointing but still very interesting.    This book focuses on many philosophical topics such as life and death, insanity and normalcy, love and being in love, etc. The whole book is a flashback to the narrator's youth and how he dealt with the various loves and losses as a college-age person.    Overall, the story is energetic with a general melancholy perfused throughout the book. Unlike other Murakami books I've read previously, Norwegian Wood lacks the supernatural component that I've become accustomed to with Murakami's works, although there are some surreal moments in the book. Despite the absence of the supernatural, I found this book to be the strangest and least understandable of all his books that I've read to date.    Usually, I couldn't put Murakami books down but with this book, it was difficult for me to finish it. I'm not sure if it was because of the general melancholy of the story or if I found this to be un-Murakami-like, but this is definitely NOT my favorite Murakami and I doubt that I will read this again.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you have a decent sound system and TV this CD is almost as good as being at the original concert! But you can watch it over and over!  The concert was very well recorded and filmed and the CD produced. The songs were as close to the studio recordings as you could ever get! Too often a live concert recording is not as good as the studio version when the music is as intricate as Pink Floyd and the audience applause will drown out the performers, NOT on this CD.  The laser/light show is fantastic and so well coordinated to the music.  If you truly enjoy the classic Pink Floyd songs this is a must have CD.
B00000K2W1|5.0|If you want to hear Janis at her very best on all the songs you remember from her hits in the 60's this is the collection for you.  I never get tired of listening to all the cuts and her versatility as a vocal artist is well represented.  It also has a thorough mini-bio in the front that is very interesting to read.
B000K7VHPU|4.0|this movie was a bit slow but very interesting, with twists and turns. i enjoyed it.
B001PPLIFU|3.0|There are several things to hate about this movie.    (1) The schizophrenic relationship between M (Judi Dench) and Bond.    Bond uncovers a sinister organization called Quantum, which has \\"people everywhere.\\"  Dench says, \\"When a man says he has people everywhere, you don't expect them to have an agent in the room.\\"    At that point, M should have gotten the message.  Find out what Quantum is doing with all these terrorists.  Admit that some British officials have gotten a bit greedy and need to be indicted.  Instead, she cuts off Bond's credit cards and sends some troops to bring him in?  Ridiculous.  That's the Three Stooges version of Britih Intelligence.  M should have been leading the charge. Instead, she acted like she was afraid her husband was a senior member of Quantum.    (2) The missing end scene.  A senior member of Quantum was supposed to be a close friend of the Prime Minister.  The original script ended with him being interrogated by Bond.      (3) The villain's plot?  To increate the amount that poor people had to pay for water in Bolivia?  Nobody could come up with anything better?    (4) The opening chase... if Bond has a 600 hp Aston Martin, let's see him use it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I'm a fan of Pink and I've liked every album she has produced, but this one is wonderful. She manages to once again twist her sound around and avoid being easily placed into a single genre. With dance-able songs and soulful songs, Pink delivers a good album from first song to last - the hidden track is great!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I recently purchased this Blue Ray and I must say that it is worth buying if you have a blue ray player.  I bought a PS3 for the games because I was not sold on the whole Blue ray craze, but when i got this, it was only about a $10 difference between blue ray and regular DVD, i was absolutely amazed.  My favorite episodes are the ocean episodes and it feels like you are looking into an aquarium.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a blue ray player.
0375826726|5.0|Book 3 in Christopher Paolini's 'Inheritance Cycle', BRISINGR is a 'must' for any library seeing the popularity of its predecessors: it continues the saga begun in Eragon and continued in Eldest, which have sold 15.5 million copies worldwide, and continues the story of Eragon, here chafing under restrictions of his powers. Eragon's oath to rescue his cousin and his divided loyalties to others lead to choices that may involve unforgivable sacrifices in this riveting fantasy, a pick for both advanced teen fantasy readers in upper grades and adults who find complex settings and fast paces irresistible.
B00000JRTX|4.0|I had teen girls in my house during the 90's and they loved this one.  Hugh Grant's best role this side of an LA alley, I hate it when I'm snide like that. Anyhow, Grant fears he will never find the one, the lightning bolt one. Each wedding, his entourage of single friends, old school chums and a vagrant mop head dutifully attend, always late, always a little worse for wear. Every funny disaster at these loaded affairs are reviewed, Grant stutters through the pratfalls. He continues this technique through Notting Hill and Love Actually. The man is now very rich.    Yes, Andie McDowell literally glows like a cosmetics company ad. Never met anyone quite as luminescent at any wedding except, er my lovely wife.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I had high hopes for this DVD, but unfortunately they weren't met.  I read the reviews before purchasing this one, and felt that I was prepared for the worst, but was still expecting the best.  The worst being:  an annoying instructor who never shuts up and likes to use a bit of cursing.  The best being:  you're going to get results with this video.    At first Jillian's constant babble didn't bother me, but after 2 weeks I really wanted to chuck my shoes at her through the screen.  I hated the fact that she cusses in the video, but the absolute worst part for me was the fact that she doesn't even do the whole workout with you!!  At least half the time she's just standing by her two \\"best buds\\" telling you how you should do what they're doing.  Where's the motivation in that?    So the worst was confirmed and it was even worse than I thought it would be, but what about the best part, the loosing weight part?    I did loose a little weight, but I truthfully have no idea if it was because of this video or from another one I started doing at the same time. ([[ASIN:B000SM6FK4 Women's Health: Total Workout in Ten!]])  I would do the 30 Day Shred in the morning, and the Total Workout in Ten at night.      So 30 day's later I've completely quit with this video because the instructor is so bloody irritating and completely unmotivating.  I still use the Total Workout in Ten everyday, and I absolutely *love* that one.  The instructor, Amy Dixon, is encouraging and motivating. (as in she actually does the *entire* workout with you and doesn't just point to someone else and say \\"do what they're doing\\")      All-in-all, I have to give this one a 2 stars.  It is an okay workout, but I just couldn't get past the instructor to get anything out of the video as a whole.
0399213015|1.0|I bought this as an extra book for my son since this is one of his favorite stories. I had no idea the book would be smaller than a dollar bill. It is a great story, but you need to buy a bigger book than this one.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Received product exactly as advertised.  Have a large collection of vinyl I want to digitize and the turntable works perfectly.
0679745653|4.0|I have never truly forgiven Capote for his caustic remarks about Kerouac's &#34;On The Road&#34; - &#34;it's typing, not writing&#34;.  I can remember the first time I read that quote and my response was something to the effect of 'where did that girlish, haughty, little gnome get off on ripping apart a classic like that?!'  Nothing I had ever read about Capote and the way he has been portrayed on the big screen has ever really drawn me to him as a person or as a writer.  But being a huge Audrey Hepburn fan and liking the cutesy film a lot (except for Mickey Rooney's role), I decided, what the hell, the novella isn't very long and I can't really judge the man as an artist until I actually read some of his work.  And while I definitely have &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; on my list of must-reads, I thought I would give this one a stab before diving into the more weighty stuff.<br /><br />&#34;It's better to look at the sky than to live there.  Such an empty place; so vague. Just a country where the thunder goes, and things disappear.&#34;<br />  Truman C.  &#34;Breakfast @ Tiffs&#34;<br /><br />Definitely a novel that is much different than the film, to call it loosely based, is an understatement.  The main protagonist, Holly Golightly, is not the same Golightly girl that sweet Aubrey played in the film.  Not even close.  And since old Tru had no problemo selling his soul...err screenplay to Paramount, only furthers to affirm just how different of an artist Capote was from Mr. Kerouac.  That's capitalism after all, so who can blame him.  Bottom line, don't expect it to be like the movie.  Speaking of the movie though, as great as Aubrey was in it, the only other person I could even possibly imagine in that role is Marilyn Monroe.  So Tru (who wanted Monroe for the part) and I are definitely on the same page there.<br /><br />This novelette is for the most part a character study of a rather bleak existence.  Holly is a sexy little siren w/ the street smarts of a pimp and the wit and acumen of a seasoned huckster.  Yet despite her gifts, she is a young woman who has been seriously wounded by the past, leaving those unenviable scars that no amount of make-up or fancy dresses can ever conceal.  Truman never lets us in to her past, maybe because Holly has none.  In fact, the only thing that really keeps Holly just a wee bit anchored is the only thing that links her to the past - her beloved brother Fred.  It is also the only person or thing in this world she truly loves, the only person she has an attachment to.  But make no mistake about it folks, as independent and free as she strives to be, deep down inside she's hungering for love and connection.  And that is the real tragedy.<br /><br />Perhaps I was expecting this to be much better than it was for me.  There are a lot of good things about this book, and why I would still recommend it to others.  After all, if you end up disliking it, at least it's not &#34;War & Peace&#34;, for it will probably take you less than a day (some people less than a couple of hours) to finish it.  I do dig for the most part Capote's simple, yet compassionate and gentle prose.  I thought it would be more ornate and elegant, so I was actually quite surpised by his terse, fluent flow of storytelling.  I also really enjoyed Holly, she is by far and away the best thing about this story.  For me, none of the other minor characters were memorable at all.  We have all known gals like Holly in our day.  People who flew into our lives like a tornado and left the same way, only to be long forgotten...  Because no matter how fun and flamboyant and furtive and fervent they were, no matter how much we all enjoyed the enigma at the time, there was nothing really sincere and sustaining about their soul to make us really miss them.  But remember them we shall!  And always with smiles on our faces while scratching our heads in wonderment...<br /><br />I expected more overall.  Capote didn't unearth enough of his oblique creation (Holly) for me personally.  It left me hungering for way more than I was given.  If she is so damn complex, tell me more?!  But then again, perhaps that was his intent - to have us all scratching our heads thinking about her, trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together even though many of the pieces were missing or didn't seem to fit.  Who knows?  And in that sense, art truly does imitate life.<br /><br />I forgive you now Tru, well, almost.  Again, overall, I would have to recommend this short, easy to read story about a very complex woman.  I didn't dislike it by a long shot; it just wasn't as good as I hoped.  And in my humble opinion, I'll still take Kerouac any day.  Then again, I can't judge a man by one novella, and a pretty decent one at that.  So the juries still out until I read &#34;In Cold Blood&#34;.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this, I hope it helps. Again, just one simple man's simple opinion...ation (Holly) for me personally.  It left me hungering for way more than I was given.  If she is so damn complex, tell me more?!

B001ANYDAO|5.0|As always, Malcolm Gladwell has presented a new perspective on looking at our social environment. Assumptions and lore are rebutted by practical observation and objectivity.     An easy layman's read with great ideas and whether the evidence can be disputed or not it opens one's pre-conceptions and can alter once believed tenants that used to explain how we get along, succeed, and thrive in the world of civilization.
B001HN6972|3.0|Poor writing weakens the effect of this movie significantly. The Winslet character, betrayed in a lawcourt by the lies of her former SS group, nevertheless goes on to accept the role of fall guy and the harshest possible sentence for a reason that will probably strike most reasonable moviegoers, upon reflection, as frivolous at best. Coupled with this specious action is the unexplained reticence of her former lover, who posseses information that would serve to get her a markedly reduced sentence, one equal to that of the others of her group. Being of the postwar generation, is this young man not forthcoming in order to show off his disgust at the role she played in the infamous German past, or is he just ticked off at her sudden disappearance years earlier from his life? Rather than emerging as a richly secretive figure with ambiguous motives, he, like Winslet, is finally just an outline David Hare for whatever reason, chose not to fill in.     Unlike some reviewers, I have no objection to the decision to present the members of the former SS group as having individual differences, or to show the Winslet character as both sinning and finally - to an infinitely smaller degree - sinned against. But the absence of any rich interiority in her character renders this just a strategy of an author's mind and not a source finally for any intellectual or emotional wallop. Hence the film's peculiar tediousness. Like a number of other reviewers, I think with finer writing this could have been a much better film.
B000056HE9|5.0|One of the best Holiday Movies made in the 20th century. This is a sleeper of a  movie made in 1947 with an all-star cast. Every actor gives a great performance. This is one of those movies that gives you hope for mankind and angels alike. Pay close attention to the scene (later in the movie) where the angel (Cary Grant) tells the story about the gold coin. Christmas in our household is not complete without viewing this movie.<br />Amazon had the best price and shipping (they always do).

0790729725|4.0|The movie was directed by Martin Scorsese and released in 1990.  I was not really interested in seeing it until a friend mentioned \\"it is a classic - a must see, even if it if violent and graphic - it is based on a true story.\\"<br /><br />After seeing it I realized this was the story the  popular TV Series, The Sopranos,  is based on. Mundane tasks of everyday life with family and friends are framed next to the violence of mob life.  The stark contrasting brings the mob in focus. It follows the life of Henry Hill; the movie is narrated by him throughout and later by both him and his wife Karen.<br /><br />The first line in the movie is \\"As far back as I can remember, I've always wanted to be a gangster.\\"  This is from a young pre-teen named Henry Hill in 1955.  He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn with an abusive father,  an overwhelmed mother and four siblings.  He did not care about being President, he worshiped gangsters and wanted to be one with every fiber of his being.  He saw shady transactions at a cab company across from his building.  He knew blackmail, kickback's, gambling was going on - this was his escape from boredom.  He wanted excitement and idolized the mob.  Somehow he got a part-time job parking their Cadillacs and waiting on them hand and foot.  He was paid well and made more money than the kids in his school, plus had \\"respect.\\"<br /><br />Once the movie started, it engrossed as well as shocked.  The brutality and killing was \\"part of the job\\" .  Even though the mobsters acted tough and cool - you could feel the stress of the job was with them.  Scenes showing how the secrets were kept, how limits on communication, avoiding \\"witnesses\\", and the irrational \\"blowups\\" over nothing ended innocent people's lives.  It relieved their stress for a short period of time, but caused more stress hiding bodies.  Mobsters liked the excitement of what they did, but watched constantly over their shoulders for a snitch, as well as paid high fees for \\"protection.\\"  The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.  Lorraine Brocco, who played Karen Hill was great.  (She looked so familiar - then I realized she also plays the psychiatrist on the TV Series of the Soparanos.)<br /><br />Martin Scorsese did a brilliant job with the directing and camera work.  The rock and roll music from the 60's was a good \\"place setter of time.\\"  The script moved well and the characters were well developed, believable and real.  It was a great mob movie.  Ray Liotta was fantastic as well as Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro - all a \\"cut above.\\"  I understand why this film was recommended as a \\"must see\\" -if you can stand the violence.ting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were accurate.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this video.  You can get a good workout in 20 minutes, which is usually pretty hard to do.  It is great for someone like me who has a busy schedule and getting a good workout in gets pushed to the back burner.  I also like how you can increase intensity by moving to the next level at your own pace.  It doesn't move to fast and you don't have time to get bored.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|I want to see this movie again. So I liked it a lot. For me it's one of those movies that stays with you after leaving the theater. Mickey Rourke was perfect for the role and that's because the part was created for him. Director Darren Aronofsky wanted to come down to earth after THE FOUNTAIN and he sure did. THE WRESTLER like his other films deals heavily with pain and loss. Don't expect light at the end of a tunnel. It just shows how life is a tunnel. Few people have the strength to change.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed Gran Torino from beginning to end.  The movie has a little bit of everything in it from comedy to emotional drama.  We're definitely going to get it when it is released on DVD.

B000VWE5OY|4.0|I'm so tired of watching people post reviews of the shows, especially before the DVD is out, that this review focuses on this DVD set that you can buy at Amazon.com.<br /><br />In seven disc you get quit a bit.  All 13 episodes of the show unedited as you might have seen on the BBC America Channel as I did.  Now, most of what was cut out is development of character and plots, sorry they didn't really cut out additional sex folks, but I thought most of it was useful.<br /><br />Many of the disc contain what are called \\"deleted\\" scenes and these vary from what appear to be last minute cuts to first level editing where the full sound and music is missing.  What I would have really liked (part of the one star reduction in rating) is for these deleted scenes to have been available closer to the actually episode they were cut from.  It would have been very cool to have the option to add them back in and watch the show.<br /><br />The sound was odd with a lot of softness in the introductions on most of the episodes but this sound problem did not continue in the episode itself.  Nothing new as far as I could tell in terms of sound.<br /><br />Probably just as many hours spent on these \\"featurettes\\" about filming and the actors if you are interested in that sort of thing.  Personally I'd prefer these things removed and the price dropped about $10 or so myself.  This is damned expensive for what in America would be a half season of shows.<br /><br />Given that if you are a real fan you may want to invest in these. If not, borrow them from the library or a friend and check them out.

After finishing the book I'm less inclined to believe that he is \\"putting it on\\" for TV and I actually think that he doesn't really give a damm what other people think and that he is fanatically driven by what he does.  I'm not sure he's someone that I would want to have a beer with - but I'm not the hater that I was either.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have to say I love this movie.  The characters created through the original Firefly series have always been some of my favorites.  The challenge that I have is that there are times when it seems the movie does not fit exactly into the series, but I still absolutely love the movie.
B001M4YZ90|2.0|Guy Ritchie's entire reputation is built on one incredible film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Then he did a pretty fair knock off (read: weaker imitation) of that movie, Snatch. Then he married Madonna. Then he produced nothing but crap for years and years. Now, Madonna-less, he has returned to his roots for yet another stab at the testosterone driven gangster flick. Unfortunately, as a stab, it is merely a flesh wound.   I don't care what you read in the other reviews, at least give this one some consideration. It seems that some poor folks, desperate for another ride on the lightning, have deluded themselves into squeezing this square peg into that round hole. Tricking themselves into thinking that this film is good because they want it so badly to be. And there are some flashes of old Ritchie here, but mostly it feels like kinder, gentler, recycled Ritchie. The characters are not interesting or engaging. The dialogue is barely clever in it's best parts. Aside from a pair of very persistent Russian killers, the movie has little to no humor at all. The violence is mild. The plot is a watered down rehashing of the \\"coincidence\\" crimes of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The ending is sloppy, unsatisfying and held up only by the promise of a sequel. \\"Oh, but there is lots of cursing and some people get shot, it MUST be good.\\"  Who knows, maybe Ritchie has mellowed with age. Or maybe he just couldn't be bothered. Because, whereas his first movie was tighter than tight, this flick just seemed lazy. Cashing in on a rep while delivering a deeply cut product.   And while we are on the subject of laziness (and crime), maybe Mr. Ritchie doesn't realize how widely viewed and well remembered Quentin Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" movie is here in the states or he may not have borrowed so heavily from it. Come on, the central plot device of RockNRolla is a painting that the film never reveals but is so impressive that everybody desires it and mayhem and destruction follows it. Maybe it is a painting of Marcellus Wallace's soul. Just start with that main \\"homage\\" and look for other plot devices and scenarios that were gently lifted from PF (including a modified \\"gimp\\" scene). It isn't sampling if the actors have accents.   Right?
031606792X|4.0|This was the only book in the Twilight saga that I had to take a break from (albeit a one day break)--the others I read in 2 days or less.  I thought it was unnecessarily drawn out in parts.  That said, it was still a good story and a good conclusion to the saga.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I first saw this movie at a friend's house and knew right away I had to have a copy.  This is about the cutest movie that I've seen in a long time.  You'll really feel for Wall-e as he persues the love of his life in a sweet, clumsy way that is actually believable.  Top notch animation, and some really funny moments make this movie a winner.

1577314808|5.0|[...] the first in a series of spiritually-themed novels, I am always on the outlook for spiritual books that help broaden my perspective. This book was recommended to me and I am delighted that I took up the suggestion.    This is a book that will speak to any spiritual searcher regardless of their religious background. Mr. Tolle provides the tools that will empower you to transform your life. Practicing awareness of the present moment allows one to appreciate each passing moment as well as providing a means for letting go of thoughts and emotions that do not serve one's sense of joy. By staying present to the moment one can also reduce anxiety connected to future concerns.    I always keep the book on hand when I'm traveling in order to reflect upon it whenever I have a spare moment. I am currently reading the book for the second time and I continue to gain new insights from the book and from my life as a result of reading it and practicing its principles.     Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\"
0060557818|4.0|I like the way Gaiman writes with a little humor all throughout the book.  It keeps the boring parts interesting and makes everything more realistic when you read it.  At first a little slow but the story picks up quick and there is plenty of action throughout.  I definitely recommend.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I rented this movie from Netflix because James McAvoy was in it. I loved him in Chronicles of Narnia, and then saw him in Becoming Jane and I was hooked!<br />I liked this movie Penelope. It was not too complicated, but just a twist on a fairytale.<br />It really worked. Reminded me of Beauty and the Beast reversed because this time the Beauty was a man James McAvoy and the Beast was a cute pignosed damsel.<br />What fun it is. Just the sets alone brought the whole idea to life and the story was ingenious. High Five to Reese Witherspoon for this film that thoroughly entertained me. And keeps on entertaining me, because I purchased the film. Always fun to watch.<br />James McAvoy is great in the part of the only man who does not find Penelope ugly.<br />Love wins out. As I said before I like this movie very much. I believe you will too.<br />Get out the popcorn and sit down prepared to laugh and enjoy the film. Light romantic comedy.

0061537934|5.0|There have been few good talking dog stories. Paul Aster's novel Timbuktu comes to mind as a notable exception. At a writing workshop I was once warned to never write a talking dog story. I didn't listen. If Garth Stein ever received similar advice, I'm glad he didn't either.<br /><br />This talking, or rather, anthropomorphically thinking dog story finds a near-perfect pitch. We experience the book's world through the eyes of a dog living as a human-in-training. The first-person canine narrator describes things as he sees them, interpreting things his way, while the reader interprets the same events from a human perspective. For me, it was the tension between these two points of view that created the real tension. I spent half the story seeing the dog Enzo's master as perfect, and half realizing that a dog's perspective may not be the most reliable.<br /><br />The human protagonist turns out to be, if not perfect (as any dog would see his master) at least a nice guy. I gave this book to two friends, one male and one female. The male friend and I both enjoyed it more than the female, who put it down for several weeks in the middle. The male friend did make an interesting comment, wondering if the male human protagonist would have remained so likeable if the author had been a woman. The question seems rhetorical.<br /><br />The female friend found the middle, long years when the protagonist is denied custody of his child, too long and too sad and too frustrating. The ever-present car racing metaphor, where people drive for hours-on-end to win or lose by seconds, didn't seem sufficient compensation for the emotional stress she was asked to endure.<br /><br />I liked the book very much. Even the storybook ending seemed the only appropriate reward for the loyalty, sometimes blind loyalty, of a really good dog.
1439136653|5.0|I saw the movie first.  After reading several reviews on here that the book was different from the movie I decided to buy it.  This book is just as fantastic as the movie.  It's the same basic concept.  He wins a billion rupees on a game show and is accused of cheating.  He then has to explain why he knows all the answers.  Only a few stories are similar but still different enough to entertain.  All the stories are cleverly written.  I found that I couldn't wait to get to the question to see how it related to the story he just told.  Buy this book and see the movie!! It doesn't matter in what order.
B000053GTF|5.0|This DVD has excellent sound quality. The picture is appealing. It also has English subtitles. That's what I like the most. It's because it enables me to sing along.

0307455874|4.0|I'm a big Obama fan and \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" audio book read by Mr. Obama has made me a bigger fan. Of course this book was written around 2005, and the more relevant story is being written in today's headlines and on CNN. Still you might find this a compelling read because I don't think he had any sense that he'd be in The White House 3 years later. He gives his views on life, marriage, kids, faith and politics in a clear comforting \\"Obama\\" kind of way. I can understand  why his grassroot supporters all over the country jumped on board  after reading this book when it came out in 2006. Good luck and Godspeed Mr. President!!!

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I will keep it short and simple. The movie was beautiful in its good acting and cinematogrophy, but the book is better by a longshot. Save your time for something better, SKIP THE MOVIE AND READ THE BOOK! The book is amazing.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield was an immense disappointment for me.  It lacked the campy, almost naive goofiness of the Japanese Godzilla/monster movies that made them so fun, but lacked the intelligence to serve as a metaphor for the potential and actual disaster that face a modern society (could we through in any more allusions to 9/11 in 1 film?!).    This film is told from the first person perspective (by showing the story through the lens of a handheld camera).  Unfortunately, this narrative technique greatly reduces the scope of the film to a small slice of a gigantic event.  It's like being served a pepperoni instead of the pizza.  I think War of the Worlds, to a certain degree, also suffered many of the same problems that Cloverfield suffers.  What is the point of a monster movie, except to see mayhem on a massive scale: gigantic monsters; loving shots of modern weapondry in action; large crowds of people squished underfoot.  Instead, we get a jittery, limited view of some potential coolness, and get left with the feeling that ridiculous New York film school technique prevailed over giving the audience what they want.    The appealingness of focusing only on a few people in a Godzilla style movie rests solely on how interesting those few people are.  What do we get?  Four or five annoying twenty/thirty somethings who we already learn to hate after having to watch them whine, bitch, and connive about their lame personal lives for twenty minutes.  I forget the name of the character who holds the camera throughout most of the movie, but I actually clapped and cheered when the monster eats him at the end because he was so impossibly annoying.  With buildings blowing up and collapsing, breaking news casts, and people covered in soot and dust, Cloverfield clumsily tries to equate the situation of these 5 losers to New Yorkers during the 9/11 attacks.  I won't launch into a long diatrab about it - suffice it to say that this attempt to evoke the terror and confused of 9/11 utterly fails for a varity of reasons.    There are a few things that are good about Cloverfield.  Special effects are done well (though the design of the monster is absolutely pathetic in my opinion), and there is some decent scenes of destruction and mayhem.  Other then that, the only reason to watch this movie is to cheer when the camera man gets eaten at the end.
0439023483|4.0|The world in \\"Hunger Games\\" is anything but perfect.  At least this is true for the denizens of the twelve districts that surround the Capital.<br /><br />Those in the districts struggle by day to day to get enough food to survive, while life in the capital seems to be pretty good.  70-some years ago, the districts and the Capital went to war.  The Capital, with its highly advanced technology and well defended cities, won, and as punishment both obliterated the 13th district and imposed the Hunger Games.  Every year, each district will supply a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in the Ultimate Game of survivor.  Viewing of the Games is mandatory, as the districts are forced to watch the 24 teenagers enter the vast outdoor arena.  Only one of them will leave it alive.  If they do well, the people outside might spring for some extra supplies to be sent to you, providing an extra edge.  Victory means a life of comfort for you and your family, as well extra food for your district for the year.  Defeat means you get sent home in a box.  It's \\"Survivor\\" meets \\"Gladiator.\\"<br /><br />Does that sound interesting to you?  Because that premise is really probably all you need to know.<br /><br />In sharing the idea of this book with my students and peers, there have generally been two reactions:  \\"Hey! That sounds cool!\\" and \\"Ummm, no thanks.\\"  If you feel more of the latter, then I think you can safely pass on this one, and look on to other things.  But if your interest is piqued at all, then this is a book you should make an effort to pick up.<br /><br />The book is exceptionally well written.  Katniss is a strong, believable main character, whose skills and determination lend themselves well to the Games, and will be popular with both boys (for her ability to survive and fight -- my favorite involves her creative use of genetically altered bees) as well as girls (for the lovey-dovey stuff).  The narrative moves at just the right pace.  There is action, there's sadness, and even humor.  Yes humor, woven into the story in all of the right places, mostly through Katniss' observations of the world's ironies.<br /><br />Fair warning, however: the book does end on a cliffhanger.  \\"Hunger Games\\" is what appears to be the first of what will become a series, and the choices last surviving players of the game make towards the end of the games have consequences that we have yet to see play out.  For my part, I'll be picking up book two the day it comes out.<br /><br />But really, in the end, this is \\"Survivor\\" meets \\"Gladiator\\" done very, very, very well.  And really, for better or ill, that's all you need to know.or.  Yes humor, woven into the story in all of the right places, mostly through Katniss' observations of the world's ironies.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|When I first went into the store to get this CD, I basicly had no idea what I was buying. I had heard the song Body snatchers from the album and then I decided to buy the album. I hadn't read reviews, listened to anything else on the CD, I hardly even knew who radiohead was. Now that I have listened to the cd several times, I am astonished by it. This entire album is incredible, and I can't think of anything else to say. After this CD, I decided to look at some of their other albums, and after having listened to those, I can see that Radiohead has been trying to find their true image as a band musically. I believe with this album, they've made it their, or are pretty damn close
630529142X|5.0|The comedy was retarded or was it? Looking deeper in on this modern comedy we see that this movie has something special. I saw it recently for the second time and watched the whole thing all the way through. So, it has the ability to go through time and still be a classic. The dialogue is Freudian in context and parts of movie use surreal sequences in creative juxtaposition. Thumbs up to a movie that at first glance seem throw away worthy, but it ain't easy.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After seeing the movie I decide to buy the CD, the music is original (written not just for the show but for the soul), not that commercial like the dozens of CD you might found on market.    Anyway, I recommend this CD to everyone. Don't waste your money for stupid things, instead buy aloe vera for your soul :o)
B000EHQ57Q|5.0|Okay-Nothing wrong here with the base-it sounds awesome through my Lifestyle 12 Series 2 System What does, and always has plagued this masterful recording is the inherent distortion riding throughout. I think what is happening is the closer we get to hearing the master tapes, the closer we get to the distortion, and it is now obvious (Listen to tortoise and the hare). As far as the 5.1 \\"Quad\\" mix-I have mixed emotions-some songs are better served by it than others, for the best try Melancholy Man-it is terrific, which leads me to another curiosity.<br />My system plays the center channel, with vocals, which is a contradiction of what others are saying. Of the bonus tracks, only two Question, and Dawning hold much interest, and show much difference to my ears-both are significantly different, and don't seem to be bothered by the distortion problem of the crossfaded tracks.Mike's # 1 is pleasant, but probably forgettable as well. I wonder if any one has ever considered releasing all the tracks non crossfaded-interesting possibility!  All in all I would rate this version B+. I don't hear much difference in the standard CD layer. I have just heard better 5.1 mixes for comparisons outside of the Moodies catalogue try The Elton John mixes, particularly Madman or Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. As far as the packaging and artwork, I feel it is spectacular, and to the one reviewer that said it looked cheap, you must have a different version than me.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|Mick Jagger earns a few honest dollars as a clerk in The Bank Job. This is just one interesting detail in a movie that overwhelms you with details. The acting is sound, the direction is excellent, and the plot keeps your interest. There are several bizarre twists and turns. It's filmmaking at its best.     It's based on a true story, the robbing of a London bank in 1971. Director Roger Donaldson pointed out in the DVD commentary that he researched court transcripts and visited actual locations. The robbers tunneled under the bank, broke into the vault, and looted scores of safe-deposit boxes. They grabbed a fortune in cash and other valuables, much of which was never claimed because it was dirty.    But it turns out that the boxes also contained incriminating photos involving the Royal Family and a ledger that documented massive police corruption. So, it was not the \\"simple\\" heist that the thieves had planned. They are pursued by powerful and vicious people.    The robbers are a motley crew of petty criminals who were tricked into the heist by Martine Love (Saffron Burrows). She made a deal with the government in order to escape prosecution for a drug bust. If she can get those nasty photos she will walk. So, she recruits Terry Leather (Jason Statham), a former lover who runs a shady used car operation that is deeply in debt to a loan shark. The tough and resourceful Leather puts together a band of hoods who are oddly innocent and loyal to each other. Leather and a couple of the others come off as rather solid family men. They seem to be \\"blokes\\" who want a big score to escape tedious lives.    There's some of that distinctively droll British humor. It's made clear that the British mind-set differs markedly from our Wild West mentality here in the colonies. And the film leaves you contemplating a titillating question that has never been answered. Was that Princess Margaret friskily frolicking in the Caribbean?

B001ACH4DS|3.0|I need to start by saying it's probably not fair for me to rate this CD because I like mainstream hard rock, and this CD isn't that. But I bought it because I enjoyed David Cook on Idol last season and some of the producers/input came from the rock world. (Why a hard rocker likes Idol is another topic). Back to Cook, with the exception of track 6, Bar-Ba-Sol, my criticism is the music is too over processed, not edgy enough and too \\"smooth\\" (part of what I liked about Cook was his rawness). His vocals seem underplayed at times against the music and backup singers. But it comes down to this - it's just not my style, plain and simple. Looks like everyone else just loves it and good for him. I wish him success in whatever genre works for him, this one just doesn't work for me. And if you consider yourself a rocker, it probably won't work for you either.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My wife and I rarely agree on movies, however we both gave Death at a Funeral 2 thumbs up.  This movies has it all from a midget, to poop, a naked stoned fiance and that is just for starters.  There are about 10 sub plots going on during the movie and each one is clever and well thought out.  To go into more detail is to give away the plot.  Lets just say that the movie plays out like a well written book that you can not wait to turn the page.<br /><br />This movies is funny, well done and very enjoyable.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.  I have already loaned out my dvd to a friend and will continue to recommend Death at a Funeral to everyone I know.
B00003XAVA|2.0|Well, I dusted this one off after many years, on an impulse, and it doesn't sound any better now than it did then. It's an album of extremes, between brilliance and utter mediocrity. Unfortunately, the mediocrity tends to sour the pleasure of listening even to the brilliant songs. Surely \\"To the Last Whale\\" is a breathtaking composition even if you're not moved by the subject theme. It remains a feather in the cap of Nash, who is sometimes too sing-a-long pop. But too many songs are just uninspired, and the routine country of \\"Cowboy of Dreams\\" is one of those numbers whre you scratch your head and wonder \\"why?\\" Whatever the deeper meaning of its lyrical content, it's simply not a worthy song: it's hardly even a song, it's more of a basic pattern shared  by absolutely countless equally rote country songs.  Perhaps I would have given the album a third star on the strength of its better songs, but I feel that, should you be a potential customer, in this era of downloading you deserve better than to buy a whole album for the few good songs: download the superb ones and save a few bucks. Of course, what is superb will vary from opinion to opinion, which is why one can listen to generous samples, if not on this site, then elsewhere.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I have watched every Star Wars made, purposely avoiding this one. I am not a fan of the Saga, but it has a few good moments and of the newer ones, I liked Revenge of the Sith the best-both in regards to actual plot and acting improvements.     Finally after being utterly bored at home and this on at a convenient time, I decided to just watch it, just to watch it. Well, I am actually surprised I sat through the whole thing. Attack of the Clones was pretty darn cheesy, from beginning to end, but Phantom Menace no doubt takes the cake in that department.     I actually thought watching Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor on screen together would be far more interesting than it was. Well, Mcgregor was underutilized and Neeson was a bore. The awful dialogue didn't help matters. Neither did the special effects. I nearly fell of the couch upon seeing Yoda in this.     I just don't get it. You get these brilliant actors-outside of the Star Wars arena-and they're great. You put them in front of a green screen and they're so unbearably wooden it's weird. And this didn't even have the excuse of Hayden Christensen.  But Natalie Portman was just odd and stoney in this one, as in the rest of the trilogy. Of course normally, she's a pretty good actress. Same goes for just about every actor in this. And I'm not even going to get started with that Jar Jar character.    The editing was all over the place-just way too jumpy. Music was pretty cool-at least that stayed consistant. The costumes were just beautiful, no question there. Everything else-a mess. It just all came off a bit childish. Darth Maul would have been a really cool character-if he were in the film for more than five minutes.     I thought Attack of the Clones was the worst Star Wars film, but after finally watching The Phantom Menace, there is no doubt in my mind that the positions have changed.

B00139B39E|5.0|never heard of this band before. after reading reviews, i bought this cd. i really like this cd, great music    'The Dark Side'  CD1,  presents the darker side of Dream Theater, and once you're past the hit, then you're off into an intensive listening experience, taking in some heavy slabs of music like 'Peruvian Skies', 'Endless Sacrifice' and 'The Root Of All Evil', which demonstrate how you can move through different gears, and still remain heavy.     'The Light Side',CD2  presents the more melodic side to Dream Theater. There are some really wonderful moments on this CD  as Dream Theater display a warmth sometimes missing on 'The Dark Side', where they're busy showing their chops off a bit more. It also has 'Hollow Years', as well as truly stunning songs like 'The Spirit Carries On' and ' I Walk Beside You'.
B0002FQAZM|4.0|overall this very best off is fairly complete. however i have two good things to say and two bad things. the good things are 1) the three previously unreleased tracks are good \\"up for breakfast being a great future classic van halen song\\" (too bad sammy is not there anymore and they did not have time to siung this song in concerts or else it would have been a classic. 2) the way the cd is laid out. first on david lee roth tune then one sammy hagar tune. this is nice. the two bad things are 1) the way the track finish what you started ends in a terrible and abrupt way. the first time i heard it i thought my cd player was on the brink. 2) the three live songs at the end of disc to are totally useless. these three songs is what made me give a four star review instead of a five. why so? because who ever made this greatest hits list left out one crucial song from the balance album called \\"don't tell me what love can do\\" probably one of sammy hagar era's best songs. and plus they could have put a few more tracks from david lee roth era which are worth thier weight in this list.
B000N6TX1S|2.0|While Children of Men begins with an interesting premise and is visually tantalizing, the logical gaps here are wider than Blart's Britches.  For one thing, though systemic repression of an influx of Third World  immigrants is a genuine and frightening scenario, it makes sense only in a world of explosive growth. The declining population of an infertile world would cap the pump of refugees created by competition for scarce resources. In a world running out of people, immigrants are a prized commodity.  Secondly, making sure the only fertile human on the planet got safely into the hands of experts who could study and perhaps replicate her biological gift is literally a world-saving decision. Clive Owen's character is neither an ideologue nor a potted plant, so it's incomprehensible why he would agree to a quixotic quest for some legendary \\"sanctuary.\\" Finally, that the MOST VALUABLE BEING on the planet could simply walk past a battalion of soldiers WITHOUT BEING DETAINED squeezes the last smidgeon of sustainable disbelief out of a credibility-parched script.    The writers do deserve props for being the last humans on earth who remember \\"In the Court of the Crimson King,\\" but even that can't compensate for Michael Caine's hokey philosophy or the one-mike-per-hectare approach to dialogue recording. A much more enjoyable annihilation scenario would involve these hippie anarchists of Children of Men meeting up with the fascist slackers from Fight Club.

B001HY3BFE|5.0|Saxon continues to improve on decades of heavy metal excellence.  Biff Byford and bandmates are true living legends who could easily rest on their contribution to rock history.  But enough is never enough with this band - they just keep making great records.  \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" is powerful and sounds huge - great production.  The songs easily hold up to the classics and some bluesy grooves round out the material nicely.  Metal fans are truly blessed to have Saxon still pumping out great records like this.  Long live Saxon!
0553062182|3.0|When I first read this book several years ago I found it quite intriguing.  So why do I rate it 3 stars?  In a nutshell, I believe the author treats socio-cultural phenomena as epiphenoma (not central to the genesis of sensitivity-related problems if you will), and that the creation of a HSP phenotype (or race of human if you wish)could be a reification, to a greater or lesser extent. The author does address how our contemporary culture is not a welcoming or healthy environment for HSPs in general, and has written about what HSPs can do to protect themselves....but, I find myself asking a nagging question as I read this thesis: is the author possibly reifying the concept of a HSP? and if so, she could well be minimizing a much more evil force afoot in our contemporary society--the cultural toxicity that destroys self-esteem from a very young age and enslaves people to various psychological problems as they age--anxiety disorders, drug addiction, eating disorders, etc. If you went to middle school and high school in US (or probably anywhere) you know what I'm talking about.     Indeed, as a practicing psychiatrist for the past 6 years, I could give any of my anxiety disorder patients this book and it is my belief that many would conclude that they are HSP.  But is this accurate?   There is no doubt children are born with different biological temperaments, and that there probably exists a cohort of children that are more sensitive to stimuli(and I would not be surprised if these children were at greater risk for certain psychological problems later in life).  And according to the book, these children grow up to be HSPs, victimized by a society unaware of their unique properties and needs.  But what if the real genesis of a person's anxiety/sensitivity  (or whatever psychological problem...if it is a problem) was caused by toxic cultural processes in the first place (usually occurring in the first decade of life) and this is the real source of suffering--a self image severely beaten down by a toxic culture! I do not know the answer to this question, but the few people I have witnessed significantly reduce their difficulties with anxiety don't seem to be HSP anymore. Which brings up another risk...could accepting the label of HSP make a person say, \\"well this is just the way it is?\\"  which would be fine if it IS truly a biological phenomena impervious to change...but what if itisnt? what if it's a deep-rooted psychological problem that could be changed?    Paul Nicholas, MD, MPH   email: stealthy_armadillo@yahoo.com    In sum, the book is intriguing, but is it guilty of reification?  I don't know, but this is my suspicion....the author doesnt address it.
B0017R5UAA|2.0|Firstly, I must admit to only listening to this CD once. And it was hard enough getting all the way through. I really don't get why so many people are saying this is a masterpiece when there are so many albums out there so much better, check out Marah or Jackie Greene to name just two. It's extremely slow all the way through and quite frankly alot of the songs are very hard to understand. It will probably be the last time I buy a CD based on so many rave reviews!
B00005JNTX|5.0|What is to be said of Sin City? It is by far one of the greatest graphic novel collections of all time and now, it is available in DVD form. This DVD will rock anyone's socks off, whether you are wearing white socks, black socks, grey socks, or argyle socks.     This is a great movie! If you are a fan of the comics (which I am) you will be happy to know that Sin City the movie stays closer to the comics than any other movie based off a graphic novel. Enjoy, kids!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had seen bits and pieces of the Planet Earth series when the Discovery channel ran it and was tempted to buy the series at the time.  However, I decided to wait until the High Definition \\"war\\" ended and then bought a BluRay Player.  I then began checking for the best price on a BluRay DVD and found Amazon had the BBC release on for a great price.  I can only say that this set of DVDs is far and away my favorite collection.  The pure video quality of BluRay is stunning and that in conjunction with the incredible range of information cprovided in the four DVDs makes for an enthralling and faxcinating viewing experience.

B00004TJTS|5.0|Our family enjoyed this movie but our 6 year old did cry in a few spots, but she got over it pretty quickly and really enjoyed the movie.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Like a movie iPod, \\"Donnie Darko\\" cycles through several familiar tropes: there's the Rift in the Space Time Continuum, not in deep space or the future, but in the Seemingly Ordinary Town Where Nothing is As it Seems, also surreally exemplary of the Hypocrisy of American Suburbia. There we meet the Troubled, Misunderstood Loner who occupies both a Waking Dream and the Painful Gravitas of Adolescence, and walks the Tightrope Between Genius and Madness... you get the idea. There's not one, but two Deus Ex Machinas bookending the movie: the first a literal god-machine falling out of the sky (we even see it suspended from a crane, just like in one of Euripides' plays); the second an \\"It Was all a Dream\\" sequence. Each turn the chief cliché about deus ex machina... that it's an escape hatch for an unskilled storyteller who's run out of ideas... on its head by making it the basis of this bravely entropic, mesmerizing story instead of a clumsy copout.     These themes have been explored so many times, and so often badly, that the threat of cliché should be overwhelming and constant. But neither we nor Donnie are ever explicitly told this is a sci-fi movie. Since a parallel universe would look just like our own, how could he (or we) know? Everybody \\"knows\\" that an alternate universe is highly unstable and threatens to collapse the real one, but who can really say why? Such understanding is seemingly embedded in the hive mind of human DNA; it was probably there before such a story was ever told. \\"Donnie Darko\\" exploits these profound, resonant themes with a poignant touch. By setting the End of the World in 1988, the movie humanizes its futuristic plot with the elegiac, selective patina of memory.    We learn in the Director's Cut commentary that writer-director Richard Kelly began his script as a stream of consciousness and worked backwards. He tries to reach an internal circle of logic that he never quite figures out how to close, and we're all the richer for this slightfailing. Kelly claims that each of the characters are subconsciously helping Donnie fulfill his mission, for instance... which he never adequately conveys on screen. But such \\"shortcomings\\" make \\"Donnie Darko\\" play like a classic rock album side, or a poem excerpted from a Thomas Pynchon novel. Even in this slightly more explicit Director's Cut, \\"Donnie Darko\\" re-casts that most plot-bound of genres, science fiction, as lyric.     Kelly's plot dumps any pat exposition of time travel's well-known logic in favor of broad, painterly strokes.  \\"Donnie Darko's\\" many moods... reverie, thriller, ghost story, drama, satire...  probably wouldn't flow with the same engrossing continuity had Kelly ever found a way to close those nagging gaps in plausibility. Each genre, instead of jarring the viewer out of the story, becomes a deeper fold in the maze of the minotaur's lair. Intentionally or accidentally, the film strikes the perfect balance between authenticity and mystique... with most of the former carried by Kelly's quirky, perfectly cast portrait (especially Jake Gyllenhaal) of a dynamic, intelligent and caring family who at once exemplify and transcend the typical foibles of the upper middle class.     The film's other anchor in plausibility is visual; its concrete geography (the wealthy American suburbs) and distinct, recently lived cultural history (the 1980's) are filmed with a documentarian's eye. It's a clever extension of the historical-fiction, the-personal-is-political conceit: a time-travel story about the fate of the universe that's uniquely timebound and never leaves the hero's neighborhood, keeping our attention on its characters' hearts and minds. Because the film never resorts to a facile description of its own logic (a sometimes annoying \\"shortcoming\\" of life itself), the well-worn clichés of time travel are restored as a vessel (a portal, if you will) to \\"Donnie Darko's\\" deeply human, profound themes.     Only after Donnie fulfills his heroic mission dothe lives he's saved get a fleeting, disembodied glimpse of his sacrifice. Even the audience isn't quite sure what Donnie's accomplished. We wake, with the whole town, from the film's dream logic to its final, tragic consequence. We only know, from Donnie's laughter and the peaceful (return to) sleep he faces his fate with, that his victory has brought him a happiness and comfort no earthly existence ever could.    \\"Donnie Darko\\" isn't a puzzle you solve. Because we're never comforted with a solution, our empathy stays squarely with Donnie, as we join his struggle to understand man's place and purpose in a universe where Everyone Dies Alone. And because these, like the movie itself, are insoluble riddles, we watch again and again.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen was pure glam rock. Freddie Mercury was 1 in a million, his voice was the best in rock (Robert Plant's is second). He was incredibly flamboyant, and operatic and Queen definitely gave the greatest live shows of our time. They sounded like no other band with four hit songwriters who wrote many songs that would later become sports anthems or movie themes such as the amazing Flash, Who Wants To Live Forever, One Vision, We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions and Another One Bites The Dust. The 1st Disc is 70's glam rock Queen and the second disc is 80's pop rock Queen. I prefer this collection over the 2 previous Hollywood releases of 'Classic Queen' and 'Greatest Hits' because this version has one of my favorite Queen songs, \\"Innuendo,\\" and the song \\"Flash\\" that was on the original greatest hits album from 1981. The song order is also better. The only flaw on the second disc is the recording of \\"Under Pressure.\\" This version sounds different than the one on `Classic Queen.' The base is much softer and the vocals don't flow as well.  A reminder: Disc Three is not a greatest hits cd. It's a cd of mostly solo works, songs from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, and songs from the album `Made In Heaven,' an album that came out after Freddie died. The third disc does not do the band any justice and should be re-released with actual hits or songs from Queen during their prime years. Hopefully, Queen's Brian May will someday release a true best-of collection with classic songs that did not make the hit chart but were true masterpieces. I'm talking about the songs: Spread Your Wings, You Take My Breath Away, Love of My Life, Melancholy Blues, Teo Torriatte, Death On Two Legs, The Prophet Song, 39', and Seaside Rendezvous. Songs on 'Queen II' like Procession, White Queen, The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke, Nevermore and March Of The Black Queen should also not be ignored.   If you want a great introduction to Queen with their most popular hits, this is it. But, if you want more on the best of Queen, I recommend you pick up 'Queen II', 'A Night At The Opera,' and `A Day At The Races.' These are Queen's three best albums and Queen during their prime.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|I enjoyed watching The Final Riot DVD, it felt like I was there (I only wish I could have been). The documentary footage was also a blast to watch, it gave the band a chance to explain themselves to the fans as well as showing what they go through while being on tour. I even love the CD so much that I listen to it almost everyday!

B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I was worried about the new companion.  Having only seen the Doctors companions pine over him in one way or another, I wondered if I would still be as taken in by the storyline if the companion was simply a friend, without any romantic undertones.  Silly of me to worry, as I think there are moments of greatness in series 4 of Doctor Who.  Catherine Tate does a wonderful job bringing the 'everymans' or in this case, 'everywomans' type character of Donna Noble to life with humor and spunk.  It was nice seeing a companion who was quite all right yelling at the doctor when he was doing something foolish.  Her growth throughout series 4 is done so intricately and woven so well into the story that when all is revealed about Donna, you'll be thinking back to catch all the moments it was hinted at.<br /><br />David Tennant is perfect, as always and works very well with Catherine Tate.<br /><br />Overall, this series shares the same 'magnetic pull' as the others and if you're like me, you won't be able to stop thinking about this series for a good week after finishing it!  For those fans of the spin-offs, we see the Torchwood gang (spoilers in these episodes if you have not finished Series 2 of  Torchwood!  Beware!) and the Sara Jane Chronicles crew in the final few episodes of the series, which was quite fun to watch.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend using this series as a jumpstart into the Doctor Who world, b/c certain storylines from as early as series 1 are tied up and you'd be pretty confused and probably wouldn't truly understand the emotions behind that if you were to jump into series 4 off the bat.  Others have posted episode guides, so I will pass on that, but will leave you with this one last bit,  watch this series if you've seen the past three and thought, 'wow, this is good tv'.
0743290119|3.0|It was funny and entertaining although it took too long to get the story started. It would have been better without some of the first pages of the book.

1400063515|1.0|It is obviously a difficult exercise to write a popular book about (applied) Science without turning into a populist pamphlet, especially for an upper class intellectual, and it is almost inevitable to end up oversimplifing one's discourse by emphasizing a few examples over others and making theories out of those examples, but I think the book overdoes it! By a fair margin. Worse, by attacking modelling tools like the Gaussian, models and modelers (as a conglomerate of \\"charlatans\\"), the Black Swan contributes to the anti-Scientist discourse that is unfortunately so prevalent today. Being a skeptic is commendable and scientists should never cease questioning their models, but throwing all models to the winds and using only \\"facts\\" to drive one's decisions is not very helpful. As put by George Box (or by someone else before him), \\"all models are wrong, but some models are useful\\" and statisticians can devise tools to assess how wrong and how useful without falling into the \\"statistical regress argument\\" (p.310). Encouraging a total mistrust of anything scientific or academic is not helping in solving issues, but most surely pushes people in the arms of charlatans with ready answers.
0670020745|5.0|I can honestly say I have not enjoyed a book this good in a long while. This book is not only informative but it is entertaining, you will not be able to set it down. It's a book everyone should read.
0743277708|5.0|How could anyone not love this book? If you honor creative genius, this is the book for you. Admittedly, I first loved this book because I had a huge crush on my English teacher, but I've read it so many times since high school, I think the worth of the book stands on its own merit. If great writing stands on creativity and character (which I hope to always believe, pardon the split infinitive), then this book deserves pride of place in any well-read person's library. It is one of my desert island indispensibles, and after many years of great reads, it remains a favorite. Lovers of the written word, read this book!

0452289963|5.0|I love this book. It gives me something more every time I read it. But it's not for everyone. No book is. Why should it be? Even Tolle says if this book doesn't speak to you, great, go on down the road.        There is no doubt that many of the ideas in Tolle's book have been said before by others.  It's a shame people feel this is some sort of crime.  We're all different and resonate with different things.  The whole value of having different presentations of the same ideas is that they speak to different people.  There's only one author/book allowed per idea?  Who made this rule?  Why are there so many books written about the Bible then?  Who needs any after the Book itself?  Why are there multiple textbooks published for math?  Isn't one presentation enough?      Here's a plan. If you're afraid you won't like the book, get it from the library.  Read the first few pages and see if it resonates with you. If it does and you really like it, then buy it.  With this plan, your ego won't need to feel `cheated' or `victimized' because if you don't like it, you can just return it and go on down the road.

1439102813|4.0|Still Alice is a very engaging novel, while at the same time being a very frightful novel. I am the same age as the lead character, and the thought of getting Alzheimer's disease is very frightening. Alice shows a lot of courage in the book, first getting a diagnosis and second by staying close to those she loves. She realizes that a time will come when she won't recognize those people. She has to sacrifice a lot giving up her prestigious job, and being ignored by all those who used to look up to her. I applaud Alice for being an example to all of us.

B0015ABRE2|3.0|... which is great. Season 1 and 2 were 24 of the very best hours on television ever, no doubt about that.     But the third season is different. The story in itself is clever, well done and actually everything you could ask for after the mindblowing revelations in season 1, and the chilling struggle between Dexter & Doakes in season 2.     But then there is the pacing: whereas the first 2 seasons gained momentum throughout the first two, maybe three episodes and then kicked it up a notch by burying the viewer in an avalanche of great acting, suspense and brutal horror, season 3 doesn't really start until episode 5 or so. Read: most of ep 1-5 drag without anything stunning happening.     On the other hand, the 3 final episodes are crammed full of action and lightspeed storytelling. The season's two plot strands exist side by side and don't really connect until the very end, which makes for an awkward  story-telling.    The end itself feels rushed and strangely anemic, the tie-up feels a bit forced a doesn't deliver the satisfaction of the previous season finals.     It's great to see Dexter acting out of character, but certain moments conjure up scenarios usually to be found in daytime soap operas. The seasons comes across a bit too cheesy at times (in my opinion).    Also, the season suffered from a lack of David Zayas and could have used some more James Remar, but that's just me.    Still, Dexter is an outstanding drama series:  Michael C. Hall's acting is flawless, and guest star Jimmi Smits is perfect as the emotional, short-tempered counterpart to deadhearted, calculating Dexter.    Good season, yes ... but season 1 & 2 were absolutely brilliant, so ... 3 is somewhat of a letdown (but still a great show)    I hope for a better 4th season
B001F290E4|4.0|I HEARD A PREVIEW OF SOUL ON THE STEVE HARVEY MORNING SHOW AND KNEW I HAD TO ORDER THE CD FOR MY COLLECTION. HE HAS A REALLY UNIQUE VOICE.  RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THE CLASSIC SOUL MUSIC. EVEN MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SON LIKES IT TOO
0307277453|4.0|Neil Shubin was well-qualified to write this very easy-to-read and fascinating book on comparative anatomy. It contains eleven chapters, many references (but not numbered, but gathered by chapter at the end) just ahead of extensive acknowledgements and a good index.     The relations of body parts from hands to eyes to ears and other parts over geologic time is well presented with good drawings. How these parts evolved from fish or earlier into birds, reptiles, mammals and humans is presented well. Shubin was co-discoverer of a fossil fish he helped to name Tiktaalik, which is a perfect bridge between typical fish and reptiles. This is a great piece of evidence for evolution, a word conspicuous by its absence.     The details and discomforts of paleontology are well-presented. The evidence from bones and teeth is explained very well. While genes and DNA are mentioned frequently, there is no formula for either, nothing on why the key pair of base pairs bonds together, no pictures of DNA bands from a chromatogram or gel assay. Later molecular signaling between cells is described well verbally, but not a single signal molecule or its matching receptor are shown. The chemistry of odors is described without a single example of any chemical structure. At least, this could have been done in Appendices to avoid scaring the chemophobic. So even though 20th century DNA and findings are presented, this book is essentially a 19th century treatment of its topics, albeit a good one.     Up to about p130 I saw nothing to complain about, but after this point, some problems turned up. On p135 a mysterious \\"Heron\\" of Alexandria was said to have invented the steam turbine, which was regarded as a toy. In fact, it was a toy or gadget that illustrated the pushing power of steam in a fire-heated sphere with jets on opposite sides with bends so that the steam was leaving the vessel in opposite directions. Everyone else spells the name as \\"Hero\\".     On p150 the light-sensitive cells in the retina of our eyes are described without the usual shape identifiers: rods and cones. The preponderance of the low-light sensitive cells vs. the less sensitive cells that detect color is supposed to tell whether an animal will be nocturnal. \\"In humans these cells make up about 70% of all the sensory cells in our body.\\" No idea which type is meant. And why compare with the whole body? That would include odor sensing cells as mentioned above.     On p174 the conventional fraud on HIV causing AIDS is accepted. See better science at:  [...] p101; [...] pp116,121; [...] p34.     On p185, a simile is based on the hypothetical futility of making an original VW Beetle run at 150 mph by modification. Today, with turbocharging or a Porsche engine, that might be approached. But by 1970 or so, the Porsche 911, which shared unit construction, and a rear-mounted, opposed, air-cooled engine could do it routinely. Not a great simile. But not important, I admit.     On p186, there is a paleontological exhortation to exercise. But it is based on false claims that primates are vegetarians, and that reptiles and all mammals usually are active. You know that both reptiles and lions spend as much time as they can just lying around. And that athletes do not live the longest. More sedentary professors and orchestra conductors do.     On p187 \\"rich foods\\", which I looked up to mean fatty foods, are blamed for diabetes, among other conditions, in complete opposition to the overwhelming findings that digestible carbohydrates in excess are what is responsible. See: Jeff S. Volek et al., Carbohydrate Restriction has a More Favorable Impact on the Metabolic Syndrome than a Low Fat Diet, Lipids 12 Dec 08, DOI: 10.1007/s11745-008-3274-2.  Eric C Westman et al., The effect of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-glycemic index diet on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Nutrition & Metabolism 2008, 5:36 doi:10.1186/1743-7075-5-36.     On p188 the generation of hemorrhoidsis blamed on long sitting on something soft, as for truck drivers. Three of the most famous cases of hemorrhoids I know of were those of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Battle of Waterloo, Admiral of the Grand Fleet John Jellicoe during World War I, and General Omar Bradley during the D-day invasion of World War II. To me this means that the cause is stress, as was my own case beginning around 1992, which was cured with the hormone DHEA. No amount of sitting since has brought the case back.     So when author Shubin strays from his areas of expertise, he falls for dogma or mythology.

0486450066|5.0|If you are looking for an excellent example of science writing, this book is one of the best.<br /><br />Darwin's reasoning and evidence are put forward in a careful and structured way, always in plain yet descriptive English, and with a respectful humility that has never been shown by his detractors.<br /><br />Darwin knew that his ideas would cause dissent, and took great pains to anticipate every objection. Almost reluctantly, he comes to the only conclusion he can, and puts truth above the tired superstitions derived from too literal an interpretation of Holy Writ.<br /><br />Even the Catholic Church has come to find peace with him, after a mere 150 years (half the time it took for them to forgive Galileo). Among modern nations, only America seems to have a significant number of people who still think Darwin's ideas are \\"controversial\\". Hopefully the new president will be able to improve education and science literacy.<br /><br />And that is another good reason to own the book. Many of the anti-Darwin arguments are against claims that he never actually made.
0451209338|5.0|In this stellar intro to the Gabriel Allon series, we meet our hero - a former Israeli assassin - reluctantly re-entering the game for one last assignment: to hunt down a Palestinian terrorist with whom he has a tiny bit of personal history...a history which just happens to include murder.  Additionally, Allon partners with a beautiful (sometime) spy with whom he once worked a fateful operation.  The dynamics of this relationship make for a wonderfully fun read that is far more sophisticated than this amateur reviewer can convey.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I made the mistake of commencing the `Allon' novels out of order.  However, the back story which was revealed in `The Kill Artist' still proved interesting and new and, surprising, to say the least.  It's a smooth read with great suspense and plots on top of plots, which, due to the skills the author brings to the fore, remain easy to track and effortlessly enjoy.  I look forward to completing this series and hope for more great Allon novels out of Messir Silva in the future.  I cannot recommend this book - or series- highly enough and hope you enjoy the adventure!
0671027344|5.0|Don't let the fact that it's an \\"MTV Book\\" throw you off - Chbosky's \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is one hell of a book. The story itself is made up of letters that the main character, Charlie, writes to an anonymous person, telling of his life over the course of his freshman year of high school, a year that is a roller coaster ride of ups and downs. It's a beautiful coming-of-age story that captivated me when I first read it five years ago in seventh grade, and it still managed to mesmerize me when I re-read it a week ago.    This book is fantastic for a number of reasons. To begin with, the writing style and the flow of the letters are great; you get the feel that this is a kid writing these letters, yet it's not full of ridiculous, cliche phrases or slang or even a bunch of swear words. It just flows smoothly and sounds very natural, and you really feel like it's Charlie himself who's writing the words.    The book also encompasses many events and scenes that seem real-to-life; this is one of those books that you can picture yourself in, because the characters are so realistic. You can literally picture everything going on and see the events in the book really transpiring in real-life, because the characters are just that convincing and true-to-life. Many of the characters reminded me of myself or people I know, and that seems to be true for most of the people I know that have read this book. The book is so enjoyable, because it's so relatable; you can just see these things happening to yourself or people you know or go to school with. It's just fantastic.    Another thing that makes it so relatable and so true-to-life are the emotions. This book is full to the brim with so many different emotions, and they're all executed beautifully. One page, you'll be laughing hysterically at something that happened, the next you'll be gushing, \\"Awwwwwwww!!\\" and the one after that you'll be sniffing and trying to hold back tears. There is so much raw emotion in this book, and it's a joy being able to experience all of it for yourself as you're reading it.    I truly love this book, and it seems to get better every time I re-read it. It's been in my top five or ten favorite books for the last few years, and I'm guessing it'll remain there. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is a gorgeously written coming-of-age story that every teen (and adult) should experience for themselves at least once in there life. Like Charlie, it makes one feel \\"infinite.\\"

0143038419|5.0|I was originally put off by both the title and the premise of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir, but she reeled me in long before the end of the Eat section. I was so enamored of this book that I taped her Oprah segment and attended her lecture locally. To say that she has a few fans is an understatement. My biggest difficulty in reading this book was in putting aside my envy and replacing it with admiration for her spunk. This book is way more than your standard tale of a spiritual journey; it offers a chance to be enriched by the experiences of someone who traveled where most of us will never go--emotionally, spiritually, or geographically. Gilbert knows how to tell a story, especially about the people she met and the wisdom they shared with her, and now her readers. You can't make this stuff up.

Only the extreme right, with their uneducated masses of hate- and fear-mongering morons, most of whom have no health care themselves, but still blindly pledge allegiance to a fanatic and Zionistic Republican party, would claim this is \\"propaganda.\\"  The only propaganda here comes from the insurance companies and their lobbyists who own the Republican congress.
0393324818|5.0|This book was a good read.  I am a sports management major, and I found it very helpful and insightful on how the business work.  Billy Beane did wonders for the Oakland Athletics, however is that system actually enough to win a World Series.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a cool flick; in fact, it's bitterly cold. Clever and scary in all the right ways, you're sure to find it unlike any vampire movie you've ever seen.<br /><br />Most horror films are set in haunted houses or spooky castles on rainy nights, but this one takes place in modern Swedish highrises, all of their surfaces white and smooth and sterile -- until they're splashed with blood. These buildings are surrounded by drifts of snow and illuminated by the alternately harsh and gloomy light of a Scandinavian winter.<br /><br />The impassive Nordic faces of the movie's characters conceal terrible loneliness and brutality, and their predicaments are revealed at a slow, deliberate pace, punctuated by shocking violence. That most of this violence is perpetrated by children and that the children are driven by forces both moral and amoral further deepens the film's complexity.<br /><br />If the viewer is patient, he or she is rewarded with a fascinating, unsettling, and memorable experience.
B001KMB6X2|1.0|Wow, and I mean WOW is this a terrible movie.  I am convinced that the idea for this movie was written on a cocktail napkin and they went right to filming.  Should be called Babble On A.D.D. for the simple reasons that    A) It rambles ALL over the place   B) It is completely incoherent  C) I STILL have no clue what it was about but cannot bear the pain to watch it again to figure it out.  D) The movie starts where it ends and ends where it starts and that does not make a bit of difference  E) Perfect movie if you have ADD as you can pay attention and then stop and then start paying attention over and over and it would not matter    Not even worth a rental. MAN this was horrible.
B000002VMD|5.0|I used to own this CD many years old, then lent it to a friend and never got it back. Buying this CD again is a re-visit of Whitney Houston's powerful and beautiful voice that used to touch so many people's hearts around the world. This soundtrack was recorded and produced by the musical legend David Foster, a milestone for Whitney and Kevin's successful career. Whitney had gone out of scene for many years due to her personal issues and surprisingly shown up at the 2009 Grammy Award. Hope to see her new songs and albums in the future. Love it, true masterpiece by David Foster.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I really don't understand why everyone likes this album so much - there are a few good songs but overall it is just a repeat of a style of music that has been so overdone.  I really am not into this CD at all.
B0018CVQFM|5.0|Graham Nash is unique in that he first appeared with a well known British singles band, The Hollies, then formed C,S & N with Americans Stephen Stills and David Crosby.  Their debut album and appearance at Woodstock won them a grammy and stardom.  The addition of Neil Young, a Canadian, led to the release of \\"Deja Vu\\" one of the finest albums of the early 1970s.  At the same time Nash was releasing solo material, and showing his political leanings with his debut album \\"Songs For Beginners\\" which included the classic medley \\"Chicago/We Can Change The World.\\"  This 3 disc set does a great job of distilling Nash's work with The Hollies, C,S&N, C,S,N&Y, C&N, as well as his solo work.  Nash's songs are full of political commentary and hope, the latter being something we could use a lot of today.  The high definition mastering is excellent and the annotations by Nash himself make this a gotta have companion to the 3 disc David Crosby box set Nash produced in 2008.  Don't miss out or you'll be sorry.

B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is hilarious. It might be the funniest show since Friends. Really, there are interesting shows out there, but this is one of those few that you actually develop a relationship with the characters. Two thumbs up for the Big Bang Theory! :)

B001KZI7FO|3.0|This is such a wonderful book.  We have watched the movie probably 20 times, but just recently thought about getting the book.  We are still reading the book each night, even though it is February!  Was a little disappointed in the package, as I thought the CD and tape were of the songs, not a narration of the book
B001DSNG36|5.0|George Benson, one of the greatest guitar players, vocalists and entertainer of our time....now you say those three things together with every one else...there are lot of good misicians , good vocalists and godd entertainers ...but all three...? when was the last time that a house full of people just sat there and listen to a JAZZ GUITR SOLO...? I'm not talking about SMOOT JAZZ SOLOS...I'm talkning the real thing...    yes Mr. Benson is the REAL DEAL...don't pay attention to others reviews not liking the crowd dancing...this is a live concert..and it realy has that live energy feel...    And Benson is playing his heart out....    Great concert with great sound....get it...
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Not the most powerful model, but light in weight, quick to charge and simple to use.  Works for most home/party scenes and for fill on some outdoor.  Bounce works surprisingly well.  I am very happy with it and would buy it again.  Doesn't have all of those fancy features that I wouldn't use anyway if I even bothered to read the manual.....I use it on my D50.
0143036556|5.0|In this fascinating, surprising study, Pulitzer Prize winner Jared Diamond examines how and why some societies fail while others thrive. Diamond makes this history of failed societies into a page-turner, while resisting the urge to oversimplify. He unflinchingly examines cannibalism and mass murder in the hellish downfalls of Easter Island and Rwanda. Yet, he also outlines hope-inspiring successes in New Guinea, Japan and the Dominican Republic. This fat tome is quite engrossing, though in spots Diamond shows an academic's weakness for repetition and caveats. Even so, this compelling classic deservedly has spent a long time on the bestseller lists. getAbstract recommends it to anyone who hopes to understand how human societies have gone wrong - and right.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Granted that Eva Marton and Placido Domingo are the ultimate VISUAL performance of Turandot, Sutherland/Pavarotti may be the ultimate vocal performance, particularly the last scene of ACT III.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|As many people already know, the Bourne Trilogy has been one of the most successful spy movies of our time. With this great bluray release, it not only quenches my hunger for the blu ray bourne movies, but the many special feature packed inside. What i feel is one of the best parts of the set is the creative design with the packaging. The set has a magnatized \\"lock\\" that shows Jason Bourne on it. When looking on the back side of the magnet, it depicts several scenes from all three of the spy movies. I recomend this to all who want to see the greatest spy trilogy around on Blu Ray!!  P.S. The bond movies are great also!!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The real trigger attachments are an excellent investment for any gamer these little guys make using the l2 and r2 buttons have a much more natural feel.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the 30 day shred DVD! Jillian and her two best girls do a great job by reaching out to individuals on various levels of fitness.  The best part of the system is the intensity replaces hours of \\"phoning it in at the gym\\" as Jillian say's and that is a huge benefit for people like myself that have little free time.  No joke the workouts are HARD, but do exactly what she say's they will do! My only suggestions to people starting out trying to lose weight and get fit is first, have a secondary tape or exercise you like doing to use as a fillin on the 6th or 7th days as the 3-2-1 system of working out can get monotonous and break your motivation or determination.  I use Leslie Sansome walk and firm 2 or 3 mile tapes and Bob Harpers Yoga from the biggest loser collection.  I also like to hike, bike and swim when I can.  I really firmly believe you have to mix it up a bit.  Secondly, don't be afraid to modify within the program. Once you learn level 1, 2 and 3, you can relieve an injured muscle by susbtituting say skaters for but kicks etc.  I have had a pulled muscle, shin splint and a knee problem, which I worked around by doing this and the results were still the same.  If you couple the regime with a 1200 to 1400 cal diet you can get shredded in no time!  I am 7 weeks into it down 22lbs with 27 more to go.  I think the 30 day shred has been the best key to weight loss success I have ever tried and would highly recommend this to anyone serious about losing weight and getting fit! Good luck :)

B001AQO3WY|2.0|This was a long way down from the wire. It became too long, boring and repetitive. It did reflect the stupidity of the Iraq war. Mildly entertaining if snappy jargon is your thing. Gags are over used..such as the commander calling himself \\"godfather\\" in the third person. Egos running wild.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|So like many people (thanks to Fox simply not marketing this show) I saw the moview in the Theatre's before I ever knew there was a show. The movie itself did not have much marketing, probably why it did not do so hot there. However after the movie, I wanted more right away. The story in this movie is so original, and yet something we can all relate to. A body of people, who for \\"our own good\\" create a society, where as long as we think and act as one, everyone will be fine.   I have watched this movie (and the very brief series) countless times, I feel a major need for a sequel, i know bringing it back to the small screen is unlikely, especially with Fillion's new show starting soon (Castle) but, a return to either the big screen or a direct to DVD movie would be very welsome.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I enjoyed taking this journey with Elizabeth Gilbert and experiencing what it might be like to be immersed in other cultures for the sole purpose of self-indulgence.  Gilbert tells her story honestly, with humor, and with colorful descriptions of her experiences in Italy, India, and Indonesia.  I am not one to enjoy emotional, finding-your-inner-peace stories, but because this was specifically about Gilbert's personal life, without trying to teach or preach, it was more like reading about one of my girl friend's travel journals than the self-help story I expected.<br /><br />Post-divorce, Gilbert sets off to Italy, India, and Indonesia in search of various forms of healing.  In each country, Gilbert finds vibrant, memorable characters who let her momentarily indulge in her misery, then share their wisdom and techniques for a full, happy life.  There are a few whiny spots and I had to skim through some of the mushy tree-hugging spiritual discoveries during her time in India, but for the most part, I was engaged in Gilbert's adventures until the end.<br /><br />I liked the journey, but question what Gilbert truly heeded from this multi-cultural lesson.  In the end, her newly developed self-awareness and independence seemed to fly away with a tropical breeze.  But personal transformation or not, Gilbert's adventures and personal reflection, combined with her witty and succinct storytelling, make for an enjoyable read.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I think the other reviewers have summed up the album pretty well so i won't try to add any more repetition to the mix. I would just like to say I've been listening to this album since it was released and I still can't get enough of it. Renee Olstead, remember that name! Other favorite musicians are Michael Buble and Diana Krall.
B00005JPS8|5.0|The strongest entries into the new superhero movie genre.  Brilliant casting, slick effects, and an excellent plot. Downey is charming, intense and magnetic. Watched these 3 times the first week. I'd couple it with [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]
B000UBMWG4|4.0|Obviously the move is great but I would have rated this a 5 if the case would have been a bit more durable... A real pain to open and close.. All the dvds arrived loose when I opened the package

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Buy this if you want to see the most amazing nature footage in HD. Well worth 60 dollars and has great rewatchability. You will not be disappointed with this purchase, and I reccomend the Attenburough over the S. Weaver edition no offense Ripley.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|This album reminds me of Fleetwood Mac in the era of \\"Future Games\\". Smooth harmonies and excellent guitar makes this album enjoyable listening even for the Baby Boomer generation.
0307454894|1.0|I have to admit to reading this book due to the movie hype I have seen recently of it.  That said, I'm certain this will be one of the rare instances we find the movie to be better than the book.    While the story line had such promise, the principals are obviously wounded but boring.  Character development would have made this so much more interesting and a little more tutiludge of the era would have drawn us into the period.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|No problems; product arrived quickly and was in perfect viewing order; good entertaining movie if you are a Hellboy fan, which I am.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Its s great forgotten classic form teh 90s with jim carrey, amazing blue ray quality, of a story of a man that finds a mask that give him powers that he never dreamed of!
0679411585|5.0|This book explains the tactical military lessons, as well as the political and media perceptions, that formulated and drove both the political and military strategic debate and the ultimate course of this war.  It is also a well written, deeply moving story.  I have read several insightful highly regarded books on Vietnam but consistently recommend this book to interested persons who did not participate in the conflict as the best place to start.  Great, very readable military history.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This offering was a breath of fresh air during a time of reality and remakes. I found out after I watched this that most of the people who made this video did not get paid when it was made, and made it knowing they may not ever get a cent from the project. These people were there because they believed in the project, and enjoyed working with each other. And it shows! I know this is available online for free in numerous places but all the extras included on the DVD make it well worth the purchase price.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|Quite honestly, the album is not bad if you like that kind of music. Archeletto is more my style, easy listening. I still haven't gotten through the whole David Cook album but again, it is because I am not much of a rock fan.     But if you love that kind of genre of music, then it is a great album. I do like two of his slow songs, more my style.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|This is going to be quick.  This movie is really good.  It is not however as good as Casino Royale.  If you are a fan of good movies, you will like this.  If you are holding onto the past wishing you could have the campy old Bond back, you will be disappointed.  This movie was not made to make old James Bond fans happy.  The movies themselves had slipped considerably and a reboot was needed.  Please stop complaining that this isn't your daddy's James Bond.  He, thankfully, has gone the way of the dinosaur...
B000Y179KO|2.0|WHATEVER THE PERSONAL CONFLICTS MR FELDER BROUGHT TO THE STUDIO, I'M SURE HE KNEW GARBAGE WHEN HE HEARD IT AND MR FREY AND HENLEY DID NOT LIKE HIM STATING THE TRUTH.  WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A BUNCH OF MATERIAL THAT MOSTLY SOUNDS LIKE MUZAK AND IT'S NO WONDER IT'S ALREADY OUT OF PRINT AND THE LOWEST RATED EAGLES ALBUM OF ALL.  I SAW A REAL BAND A FEW MONTHS AGO CALLED \\"POCO' AND THEY ARE GREAT!
B00005JLR2|4.0|overall, a fun story, well thought out characters.  The animation of CG combined with standard old fashioned cartoon-making, I think was seemless and very entertaining.  The same guys who gave us the excellent Little Mermaid put together a story of a Gen-X type character, in another galaxy where you can sail the stars, who has a wanderlust for travel and adventure -- who gets in trouble with the Robocops -- who makes unusual friends and the strangest alien people.<br /><br />It's a very kid-friendly film.  Adults will associate this film with Disney's Peter Pan perhaps or even the Little Mermaid.  Though not as entertaining as these, it really hits off with melodrama (a bit much for me) and a lesson in pursuing dreams.<br /><br />The DVD has tons of bonus features along with interviews with Roy Disney.  The problem I had with the features is that they chop the main features into tiny featurettes all in the same DVD, so when you think you're watching something new about the film, you see the same scenes again and again.  Example, watch Disney's Animation Magic, a good featurette, and then they slice the making of Silver out of that and place into the Disneypedia section.<br /><br />Lots of info for kids on pirate history, what the flags mean, what types of ships they sailed and so on.  Even clips from the old 1940s pirate films, I noted a bit of Errol Flynn!!<br /><br />Certainly no Pixar-fueled Wall-E, but definitely has the charm and wit of a Disney film.<br /><br />[...]
0793544610|5.0|This is a fantastic guitar tab book. I wish I had this book back when I was 12 and first started playing guitar. The only reason I play guitar is because when I was 12, I was at Camelot Music in the mall and bought Are You Experienced? on cassette(back in the day before CD's fazed out cassettes.) It was summer vacation and I had nothing better to do so I listened to Are You Experienced? for one week. After that time I had to get a guitar. I started on a old beat up acoustic and quickly moved to a Kramer electric. Then I started taking music lessons. I would bring in my cassette and asked the guitar teacher how to play the solo in Hey Joe. I learned it note-for-note. Its a good solo to start with. A lot of the basic guitar techniques are all in Hey Joe. I was a beginner when I learned it and it wasn't that difficult. The problem I had was guitar teachers don't like to spend the time teaching you an entire song in 30-minute blocks. You just don't have the time for it. So, as a result, you only learn one riff or one part of a solo. I like learning songs from beginning to end. That's why this tab book is great. For those new to tab, the last few pages have a how to learn to read tab section. Plus, unlike some guitar tab books, this one includes the actual music notes. Some of the magazines and other tab books only have tab, which is fine if you are only using it to play guitar on but it doesn't help other musicians. I asked my friend, who plays piano, to play Purple Haze just to hear the guitar licks on piano. It sounded interesting. Anyway, if I had this book back when I was 12, I would have learned all the songs faster. Tab is very easy to learn and should take about 5-minutes or less. Its not that hard to figure out. All the tabs sound great. I play a white Fender strat through a Peavy Rage amp and a Jim Dunlap Crybaby Wah Wah pedal. I use the gain from the amp and the fuzz setting from the Wah pedal. I get a great Hendrix sound just from that simple set up. Anyway, regradless of where you are at in your own guitar playing, pick up this book to take you to the next level.regradless of where you are at in your own guitar playing, pick up this book to take you to the next level.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I first started hearing about this at a favorite fanfiction sight.  I ended up buying a Region 2 DVD from England and buying a multi-region DVD player just to satiate my curiousity. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The premise of modern day Pride&Prejudice fanatic, Amanda, finding herself swapping places with Elizabeth Bennet is right out of a sci-fi, paranormal flick-- but once the story gets rolling in Regency England, the pace is fast and one better not blink!  The quick, cheeky conversations, and the twists & turns far flung from Jane Austen's original are entertaining and LOL funny. Elliot Cowen as Mr Darcy is outstanding. I think Jane Austen herself would have cast him! He had just the right amount of haughtiness, pride, arrogance, disdain, and finally tenderness.  He gave me chills when he gave Amanda a proper set down at Netherfield; so believable. The escape from Austen's usual canon was surprisingly refreshing and the play with characters was delightful. If you are expecting Austen's masterpiece P&P, this is not it. However, my Austenite sensibilities were not in anyway offended by this blatant & somewhat contrived story. Not wanting to give anymore away, let's just say that the entire ensemble was perfectly cast. It is all done in good humour and very  tongue-in-cheek. But I must admit that had I been in Amanda's shoes, I am certain I would have behaved better! And yes, I'll probably pre-order the Region 1 DVD, too!
0765342294|2.0|As a librarian I recognize that Ender's Game was hugely popular as a YA book (I'm not calling it a novel) along with the author's name, Orson Scott Card, several years ago. I thought I'd better read it before I started recommending it to Grade 5 kids looking to read science fiction. The real deal: I checked the circ listings for my county's 36 library consortium, and I'm the only one who has the book checked out.<br /><br />The story has more action than depth, and unfortunately the action is very repetitive. The characters are dull; the adults don't grow with experience, nor the children with age. The voices and thoughts of the children are never childish, never strained by inexperience or emotion, even though we are introduced to these characters at very young ages. The only thing that helped me keep the perspective of Ender as a child was flipping back to the cover art to look at the appealing picture of Ender.<br /><br />The storyline is suitable for a fifth grader, but the \\"highbrow\\" (not!) language will throw younger readers off course. Mature readers who can throttle through the stiff language will lose interest in the low level, predictable, condescending, stereotyped maneuvers at cloning a story.<br /><br />I waded through it all, hoping to encounter a redeeming moment, but at the end the reader is left only with Ender's apocryphal remorse. Ender's Game is a perfect fit for the 1950's black & white television era when we went screaming from the likes of \\"The Crawling Eye\\" and \\"Them\\", but grossly disappoints  today's sophisticated readers.
B000058B2W|4.0|PH had the rare knack of effortlessly combining progressive complexities and eccentricities with classic rock's ease and accessibility to a degree few bands could achieve, and EB&F might just be their prime example of how this fine line was walked so cleverly.
0525951113|3.0|Others have summarized the plot so I won't except to say that the world of computer gaming crosses the border into reality, making survival and/or destruction of real-life corporations, countries, individuals part of the game. It is quite frightening how much the world now depends upon computer bits and bytes to keep humming along and how easily that world can be controlled or destroyed by someone with the ability to control those bits and bytes. Kudos to the author for the premise. Much of the book I enjoyed, the action-scene parts of it were breathtaking and this book would make a great action movie IF that movie eliminates much of the geek-talk (too much techno-babble for me), settles upon one primary protagonist (there are too many in this book)and comes up with a more satisfying conclusion.    Having said all that, the book is definitely worth reading.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|I was a fan of [[ASIN:B000KGGF12 Alright, Still]], because it was catchy and different. But since then, I've heard some of Lily Allen's collaborations with other artists, and noticed just how much she's grown as an artist.<br /><br />About two months ago, I happened to hear The Fear on the BBC1 Sirius channel, and instantly fell in love. I've been anxiously awaiting the release of this album based almost entirely on that song, and now that it's here, the wait has been worthwhile.<br /><br />Almost every track is quirky poppy quality. Casual listeners will almost certainly gravitate toward F- You, which is unfortunate. On tracks like 22, Chinese, and He Wasn't There, you have a treasury of relationship songs that aren't nearly as obvious.<br /><br />The album taken as a whole is almost like Saint Etienne and Death Cab for Cutie got together to shock all of their collective fans. Or maybe I'm just trying to come up with some sort of justification for how this album can sound the way it does. In a word: brilliant.
B000W91RUG|5.0|If you are a new fan of \\"The Big Bang Theory,\\" the first season is a must have.  This was a birthday gift and we've watched all the episodes once and are starting over.  We love it.

B000002MUN|5.0|I was 18 when this album came out and I identified as much with it then as I do now. I am an avid music fan with hundreds of albums in my collection and this one of the ones that I can always put on at any time and listen to start to finish. There isn't a weak tune to be found and it's the barometer by which to measure the rest of his work. I believe it's not only his best album - with honorable mentions going to \\"Full Moon Fever\\", and the underrated \\"The Last DJ\\" - but also one of my favorite albums of all time. You cannot call yourself a Petty fan without it!!
0375826726|3.0|Simply put, I was less than impressed with *Brisingr*.  To be honest, I kind of expected it.  *Eragon* was fantastic!  *Eldest* was not quite up to par.  *Brisingr*...well, I could not wait to finish it and that is not necessarily a good thing.<br /><br />While I appreciated the background stories, I thought they were too detailed (in other words, dragged on and on) or unnecessary.  Eragon's departures from Saphira.  The whole Dwarf coronation, politics, and attempted murder.  Ayra and Eragon's undercover travels.  Roran's Hecurlic tasks before proving himself worthy of military service.  Elva, the witch child, and her enigmatic personality.  All these and other substories really drag the whole point of the story....Eragon is supposed to be confronting and fighting Galbatorix!<br /><br />Alas, you don't get rewarded such a battle.  That's because Paolini decided to expand the trilogy.  So, I read the entire book for what?!?!?  Oh, just to read how Eragon acquired this Brisingr sword.  I seriously do not know if I'll bother reading the next book.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I became a die-hard Springsteen fan shortly after the release of The Rising in 2002, quickly scooping up as much of his back catalog as I could over the next few years. I credit his Seeger Sessions album and accompanying live disc to turning me on to Traditional American Folk, much in the way Eric Clapton opened my eyes to rhythm and blues as a teenager. I bought Magic in the Fall of 2007 on the day it was released and saw him twice on that tour, and would count both appearances as among my favorite live shows of all time. So it was with great anticipation that I picked up Working On A Dream the same day it was released. I have to say that for all the rave reviews and the five stars given by Rolling Stone, I'm really disappointed overall. The album is lyrically bland and the production techniques appear to redundantly capitalize on the winning formulas on Magic. I would put \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" up with some of The Boss' best, but when I hear 2-3 more cuts on this album mimicking that mid-to-late 60's Beach Boys style, it cheapens the effect. These songs simply aren't as good, and while I applaud his effort to keep the band's energy going coming off the tour, I think the effort falls a little flat. My personal opinion is that you could've taken 7 or 8 of the strongest tunes on Magic, mated them with 3 or 4 of the strongest tunes on this new one, and made one GREAT album for the ages. Still, I'm looking forward to this tour and the prospect of more new music from him in the future. Now, onto the Special Edition of Darkness On The Edge Of Town!!!!

B000000WJZ|3.0|I wanted to rip this album to shreds because, years ago when the Smashing Pumpkins were extremely popular, I just thought they were extremely overrated.  All the kids I went to school with who believed this band was the best thing ever... it just really made me sick to be totally honest with you.  Blind fanboyism at its worst.      I still think the bands songwriting abilities are extremely overrated.  Let's face it- compared to most rock bands from the 70's and 80's, these guys aren't very good at writing songs.  Plus there's the lead singer we have to consider who's just awful most of the time thanks to his exceptionally whiny voice.  Some might even compare his voice to Mick Jagger, and sometimes the two singers DO resemble each other.    However, for whatever reason, Siamese Dream actually gets better with time.  Not worse, like that *other* Smashing Pumpkins album.      There's still many flaws with the album, such as the fact most of the songs sound exactly the same, melodically (as I mention above) the songs on Siamese Dream are quite overrated and not nearly as good as the fans would have you believe, and honestly, these guys aren't the best songwriters in the world either.  That's the truth.  Just because the Smashing Pumpkins were an influence to the whole grunge movement doesn't miraculously make their songwriting good.    BUT, the good qualities Siamese Dream features are actually quite impressive.  The vocals are decent because the lead singer doesn't hit those annoying high notes as often as he usually does, there's a dark grunge element to the overall sound of the entire album that is now probably considered an influence, and this is probably the bands one shining golden moment.  So yeah, it's a decent album, but please don't put this stuff in the same category as Humble Pie, Eloy or Three Dog Night.

I am truly enchanted by the gorgeous upon gorgeous scenes of this wonderfully crafted masterpiece. Last but not least, the plot is as great as the visual treats too! Definite 5 stars.
0765356139|4.0|You can read the summary of the story elsewhere. These are some of my thoughts about the book.<br /><br />I loved Mistborn so I eagerly looked forward to The Well of Ascension. Where Mistborn looked at the consequences of what happened if the hero of legend failed, The Well of Ascension looks at once the heroes succeed, how do they govern and create a stable world.<br /><br />I find Vin and Elend two interesting characters. Vin I like because with all her powers, she still is frail in many ways and can definitely make mistakes, including a costly one she makes in this book. Elend is a man of great ideas who has to learn to strike a balance between physical power and intellectual power.<br /><br />The story itself builds on elements that were only minor players in the first book and now are growing in importance.<br /><br />I can't wait to read The Hero of Ages.

B001GKJ2DO|1.0|My daughter (college age) and I rented this movie on Valentines Day to watch together. The lines at the theaters were too long to go to one, so we settled on this. I love Merryl Streep and thought it might be sappy entertainment for us. Wow, right from the first song I thought this is not good. I kept hoping for it to take an upswing but it was by far the lamest movie I have ever seen. The singing was terrible, the songs were boring and made no sense (with the exception of \\"dancing queen\\" which was ok), the acting was hideous and the visuals were bad (sort of like viewing it with the sun in your eyes the whole time). The story line could have been good, something different anyway, but the music, lyrics, and acting were so bad, you really didn't care about the story anymore. Needless to say, my daughter and I looked at each other about 3/4 of the way through this movie and started laughing. Neither of us wanted to spoil it for the other with criticism, but we both hated it. So we turned it off. I bet I can guess how it ends, so obvious. Anyway, I cannot recommend this to anyone, even Streep fans like myself. Really, she should be ashamed. This movie was horrible.

B000UH8BTK|5.0|This collection is part of a series of popular rock and jazz artists who have five albums packaged together at a (mostly) competitive price.<br /><br />Each CD comes in a mini-LP sleeve and - from what I can gather - is a replica of the original, so any errors in the notes are not corrected. I guess that's a bonus for those who enjoy reading agate type...and then complaining about mistakes.<br /><br />Included is the oftentimes hard too find Sweetnighter, with the four remaining albums being important signposts in the iconic fusion career of the band. This is an outstanding means for new fans to dig the vibe and older fans to acquire a nice alternative to the \\"ancient\\" vinyl and/or cassettes.<br /><br />This is a series that makes great sense....as in dollars and cents.

B001HN6972|3.0|\\"The Reader\\" had everything going for it -- a novel, sexy plot line, a period setting and name actors. What it doesn't have is that certain something that brings a film's elements together into something special.<br /><br />It's hard to discuss the movie without giving away its major surprise elements. But here goes. A 15-year-old schoolboy in post-war Berlin has a love affair with a 40-ish woman with a past. Kate Winslet plays the woman, and Ralph Fiennes plays the young man as grown up.<br /><br />I found the movie tedious and perplexing. It put my wife to sleep. The first hour focused on the rather raw sexual liaison between the schoolboy and his mistress. There was lots of nudity and groping and washing and sex -- discomfiting and not very interesting from a viewer's perspective. Then, the woman's past is revealed, and the young man has a chance to help his lover. Inexplicably, he does not. We see him brooding and moping, but have no idea what is going on in his head. Even as as grownup, his motives and continued cowardice have no explanation. By the time the credits rolled, the audience heaved out of its seats in relief.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" purports to be a film about moral complexities in post-war Germany. But it never manages to get beyond the facades of the debate. Whatever we might have learned about the difficulty of feeling loyalty to a person and repulsion by their actions is left to our imaginations. Indeed the one and only scene of any emotional depth occurred toward the end of the film when Fiennes visits a camp survivor in New York. That 15 minutes was tense and captivating. The rest of the the movie was flat and listless -- an excuse for Kate Winslet to show off her body. That's when it was not deliberately confusing. Winslet played her brutal, amoral character as a doe-eyed sensitive. That's poor acting or direction, not complex characterization. Another point of confusion was the young man's home life. His father was supposedly a stern disciplinarian. But his son somehow managed to stay out late night after night and take a 2-day solo bike trip into the mountains.<br /><br />I don't know how this sloppy, badly-played film managed to cop a Best Picture nod. It's certainly not a feel-good story about illiteracy, young love, morality or the conquest of truth over evil. Just a jumble of ideas and images strung together to no particular purpose. A shame, because an Oscar was not out of the question for this film.ehow managed to stay out late night after night and take a 2-day solo bike trip into the mountains.

0767811070|5.0|Boyz 'N the Hood is a graphic motion picture that deals frankly with the social problems and the unfair, very hard knocks in life people face in the African-American neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles. There are no punches pulled in this film and I do not recommend it for young children. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen and I was totally drawn into the action and plot of this picture; I could feel what the characters were experiencing and that tells me that this picture was done with great care and attention to detail. The plot moves along at a good pace and the cinematography is excellent.<br /><br />The action starts when we meet some young kids. There's ten year-old Tre Styles who lives with his mother Reva Styles (Angela Bassett); and two of his childhood friends are half-brothers Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) and \\"Doughboy\\" (Ice Cube). Tre has an anger problem in school; and his mother decides he should live with his father and her ex-husband Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne). Meanwhile, Tre's mother is determined to get better educated and she works hard to successfully leave South Central. Furious Styles, despite his name, is quite a fatherly figure who immediately takes a keen interest in raising his young boy Tre. Furious wants Tre to become a responsible man who can make it out of South Central someday, too. Meanwhile, even at a young age Doughboy is already getting arrested for stealing although Ricky, like Tre, dreams of getting out of South Central by playing professional football.<br /><br />The movie fast forwards seven years; and we find that Doughboy has essentially done nothing with his life--except doing time in prison and hanging out with his buddies on his mother's front porch. Ricky is eagerly anticipating going to USC on a basketball scholarship and Tre works at a mall clothing store while preparing to take the SAT with Ricky and attend college himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the rough life in South Central deals them some mighty harsh blows; and it becomes apparent that it won't be as easy to get out as Tre and Ricky first hoped. Ricky has to get at least a 700 on his SAT test and Tre has to navigate the waters of starting his first real romance with his high school girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long), the only girl he truly wants to marry. Over all this comes the incredibly strong tidal wave of South Central's drug problems and the gun violence that at times seems to rule the streets without warning. Even a black cop covering the beat is racist against blacks in the neighborhood! Ultimately, Tre, Ricky and Doughboy face some hard choices and what they do to solve their problems provides us with some of the most riveting footage I've ever seen on film.<br /><br />The two DVD release of this movie has a plethora of extras. The deleted scenes are good but the documentary and the commentary with John Singleton were the two best extras in my opinion. You can also choose between widescreen and fullscreen.<br /><br />It's abundantly clear that Boyz `N the Hood will remain one of the best social commentaries for quite some while to come. This film was inducted into The National Film Registry and it deserved it without a doubt. I strongly encourage people who study social issues and sociology to watch this film. When it comes down to it, though, people of all backgrounds should see this film and know just how hard and unfair life can be for some people.sh blows; and it becomes apparent that it won't be as easy to get out as Tre and Ricky first hoped.

0307277453|5.0|I don't want to re-state the high encomiums this slim volume has received, but I would like to offer an alternative perspective.<br /><br />I have integrated this book into my \\"critical readings\\", ie, non-text material illustrating real-world science, in my high school advanced biology class. Students read an average of 10 pages each night - in addition to any other homework - and start each and every class with a 5 question quiz on the last night's reading, just to make sure everyone is keeping up. Every ten days to two weeks we have a \\"reading cafe\\" and discuss the major themes of the books we read.<br /><br />My high school students are both challenged by, and interested in, this book. Shubin discusses the grand evolutionary themes of biology in an approachable way. More importantly, he humanizes science, by discussing his initial naivite, and failures while emphasizing the importance from learning from those failures. He also discusses science as a cooperative effort.<br /><br />Some students are enthralled by his story (one wrote that it was one of the greatest science books she had read) Some find it too slow and scientific. Most find it challenging in a healthy pedagogic sense. PErsonally, I find it exciting to have the opportunity to teach, and discuss, the role of the Hox gene without having to resort to a high level text. The kids \\"get it\\". And most are intriqued enough by Shubin to want to learn more about it.<br /><br />I strongly urge the use of the PBS Evolution DVD set in conjunction with this enlightening book. [[ASIN:B00005RG6J Evolution Boxed Set]]. If you can choose only one DVD from this set, go with the episode Great Transformations [[ASIN:B00005YUPV Evolution (parts 2 & 3): Great Transformations/Extinction!]] which features Shubin discussing his work with great excitement. As a whole this particular disc is a treasure.<br /><br />In short - this is a great read for teachers, and students of biology. This is an exciting time in our field. And this book helps convey that excitement to the next generation of science students.o the next generation of science students.

B00005JLIU|3.0|\\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\"  is a fairly good comic musical movie.  Originally, it was very good.  However, the material now seems somewhat dated.      The movie is a type of melodrama.  The comedy comes from the frantic attitudes and ideas.  Unfortunately, we have been oversensitized to \\"racism\\" and there are parts of the movie that can be interpreted as racist by overly serious and overly sensitive people.  All three of the lady stars do FANTASTIC jobs.    I do admit that white slavery seems to be an odd subject for a comedy, much less a musical comedy, but it still works.  I think it worked better in the 1960s, when I first saw the movie.      Despite my praise for the movie, I rank it as three star because the comedy does seem corny today.  But, it  is a worthwhile movie.

I suppose I have seen the movie three or four times since then.  I always enjoy some of the special effects.  The animation scenes were very good when they first appeared, but have aged a little since then.  And, Julie Andrews had a wonderful voice and sang great songs in the film.       In short, a magical nanny swoops in to take care of the Banks children and also helps their father to value them and make time for them. Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) treats the children to adventures with Bert (Dick van Dyke), a street performer/chimney sweep and with her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. There are excellent songs and dance numbers.    Children still fall in love with this movie.  Adults still like it.  And Julie Andrews' performance still shines.

I still thought it was funny, sad, and heartwrenching at times but I no longer thought of it as untrue.  So, I switched my major to Economics instead.

There has never been a better Sarastro than Kurt Moll.  Now, if we could just get rid of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus with its heavy vibrato.  They might have been able to get away this style of singing on the 1950's but things have changed for the better since then.  If you want to hear great choral singing, try anything by the Swedish Radio Choir or the Stockholm Chamber Choir.  They produce a full, rich sound, but without the heavy vibrato.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|I'm hard pressed to think of another movie where two prominent actors are more on top of their craft--where every single scene in which they interact makes you go, \\"Wow!\\"--than RAIN MAN.  I've seen this movie several times (and hope to see it several times more) and walk away with a new appreciation for what Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman were able to accomplish with each viewing.<br /><br />This is a journey of discovery, as LA car dealer/hustler Charlie (Cruise) learns, upon the death of his estranged father, that he has a much older, autistic brother, Ray (Hoffman).  Angry that he has been shut out of his father's will, while Ray is the estate's benefactor, Charlie takes Ray out of his institution and the two brothers embark on a cross-country odyssey (including a trek through my stomping grounds in Oklahoma).  Ray is a fragile man of routine, and plucking him from his institution and traveling thousands of miles is a severe disruption; while Charlie, at first impatient and angry at Ray's outbursts, tries repeatedly to \\"get through\\" to his brother--to make a connection.  Again, this is a journey of discovery, and it is Charlie who discovers some very important things. . .about himself.<br /><br />Hoffman is totally convincing and believable as an introverted autistic savant; what's interesting is that I learned during a special showing of this film that Hoffman, while the movie was being shot, thought his performance so poor and shoddy he asked to be taken off the cast and be replaced by Richard Dreyfuss.  This demonstrates he was so invested in the character of Ray he wasn't giving the character the performance he thought it deserved.  Fortunately, director Barry Levinson (who appears, briefly, at the end of the film) declined Hoffman's request; and the rest, as they say, is cinematic history.  Hoffman and Cruise gave masterpiece performances, and RAIN MAN deserved all the accolades and awards it received.  If you haven't seen this movie, please, please do so.<br />--D.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I got my DVD yesterday, and it was way beyond anything I expected. The only other videos I have used are the ones from Jenny Craig that I have had for over twelve years. I have been exercising on the elliptical and have been changing my resistance level, but nothing prepared me for this workout. Like many people stated, it was very intense. I started on level 1, but there were many parts that was extremely challenging for me. Despite slowing down in a few areas, and making my own modifications, I still sweated more than I have ever sweat on the elliptical in the 20 minutes of the session. The sessions went by really fast, and I did not keep track of time during my workout like I usually did on the elliptical.   I'm over 200 pounds, 5'2, and really want to lose weight. I felt stronger after just one workout and already want to do more. I can't wait to see the results.

076781326X|4.0|There is probably little doubt that Oliver is one of the greatest musicals ever made for the silver screen and it is an enjoyable addition to any collection. The movie is not one I'd let a child under the age of nine see due to subject mater and (although little blood is shown) emotional violence that effects even the oldest of viewers, however that is my own personal opinion. This DVD features 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, although for most of the movie only the front 3 speakers are used. Occasionally, all 6 speakers are used for sound effects and a couple of specific scenes. However, the sound is crisp and clear regardless of the lack of use of the full power of a home theater sound system. The picture is as good at they come on DVD. However the DVD is a flip side DVD; meaning that the movie is divided into two parts - one half on one side, the other on the opposite. This is not a huge issue in my eyes since it adds a stage feel to the movie and allows added clarity to the picture (often when they scrunch a film onto one side of a DVD it reduces picture and sound quality) and is edited very well so that the disruption simply seems like an intermission. Still, if you hate getting up and flipping a DVD in the middle of the picture you may want to wait until another version comes out (if one does it most likely will be on blue ray). All in all, this is a pleasant widescreen edition of Oliver on DVD.
B000003S0D|5.0|Lizard was for years and years my favorite album.  It has always been my favorite King Crimson.  Actually, I stumbled upon this band at the Boston Teaparty opening up for Al Kooper, months before The Court of the Crimson King came out in this country.    What I want to say is this-- if you love Lizard you will also like McDonald and Giles.  They were in the earliest Crimson, then left and put out this one album.  Listen to it.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|From the bad cinematography to the under developed characters, and most of all to the stupid plot. I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I cannot even begin to understand the 4 and 5 star reviews. The whole \\"issue\\" isn't even truly a major issue about Africa to begin with. They are badgering the pharmaceutical companies and not the corrupt governments that are keeping the people of that continent in constant poverty? Give me a break!
1400140331|5.0|Just a short review, the book is great if you want a good intoduction or expand your knowledge of how money, bond markets etc grew up and how they were meant to work and why they work/dont work today.    The book does not and cannot cover every aspect, the author assembles his arguments well, and even in cases that you might decide not to accept his conclusions, you still come away feeling that by being walked through his arguments, that your own take on the subject has been strengthened.    Manages to be a thought provoking book while easy to listen to, not always a goal easy to achieve.

B001J1O83E|4.0|It's not often that Liam Neeson gets into 'butt-kicking' gear, but he does here for the Luc Besson produced 'Taken'.  The movie takes a while to set up (say, 25 minutes?), and from there on, it's non-stop action.  Imagine Jason Bourne as an older, retired dad.<br /><br />The action scenes are done well, the violence is fairly graphic, and the movie feels very short (which is a good thing).  The plot has a few holes, but I guess that's to be expected with the plot moving so quickly.  Neeson does a great job, the rest of the cast is merely filler.<br /><br />If you really want to laugh during the movie, watch Neeson's daughter when she runs.  It's hilarious.<br /><br />RATING - WORTH A RENTAL, IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES, BUY IT

0345495004|5.0|Frank Lloyd Wright held that modern ornamentation, circa. 1900, was a burlesque of the beautiful.  This is historical fiction.  The story of the characters is known by the reader in advance.  The question is, what does the writer do with the material.  Is it compelling?      Genius carries with it the ability to focus, the ability to enchant.  A philanderer will claim his existence is stultifying in order to woo someone.  The novelist shows Frank Lloyd Wright exhibiting the above-noted qualities.  Wright's knowledge of Japanese art is addressed in the novel.      It is related that Mamah wrote in her diary that it isn't sufficient to be a mother.  A strength of the book is the novelist's portrayal of Mamah as possessing consciousness of self.  Arguably a character with insight is always more interesting to read about than someone with sheep-like characteristics.      Frank and Mamah, leaving their families, travel in Europe for more than a year.  They see Boito's MEFISTOFELE.  Mamah is obsessed with Goethe.  Reports of Frank and Mamah in the press cause Mamah to feel ashamed.  Frank tells her that finding her was like finding a safe place to think again.  When Frank returns to the U.S., Mamh moves to Germany for a period.  Subsequent events won't be detailed here.      The book sketches the qualities and the character of the lesser known of the two people involved in the great drama, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, effectively.  I was interested to learn in the Afterward by the writer that she had lived in Oak Park and geographical proximity gave rise to her interest in Wright's career.  The author advises that she had to make a greater effort to find out about Mamah Cheney because there was little about her in the published record.

0307455874|1.0|The state is getting more and more deeply involved in business, even taking controlling interests in some private companies.  And the state is even trying to \\"make policy\\" for private companies they do not control, but merely \\"help\\" with \\"infusions of capital,\\" as in the recent call for salary caps for certain CEOs.  So state power is growing at the expense of corporations.<br /><br />But that's not socialism.  Socialism rests on a firm theoretical bedrock:  the abolition of private property.  I haven't heard anyone this side of Barney Frank calling for any such thing.  What is happening now-and Newsweek is honest enough to say so down in the body of the article-is an expansion of the state's role, an increase in public/private joint ventures and partnerships, and much more state regulation of business.  Yes, it's very \\"European,\\" and some of the Europeans even call it \\"social democracy,\\" but it isn't.<br /><br />It's fascism.
B000IFS0HM|3.0|With the recurring theme of begging, starving, and deprivation, Frank McCourt tells of his childhood through mini vignettes in his memoir, Angela's Ashes, first published in 1996.  \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood,\\" (11).  Despite the sadness, Humor keeps Frank alive and vibrant.  After he was born in New York, where his parents met and married, his family soon moved back to Ireland where they were originally from.  The book starts off setting the gloomy tone with an alcoholic father of five kids providing no income to support the family.  Being the oldest, Francis, also referred to as Frank, looks out for his younger siblings. However, even before the family moves back to Ireland, their youngest child and only daughter, Margaret, dies due to the family's harsh living condition.  The children continue to beg, barrow, and steal food in order to survive, as their mother falls into a state of depression and continues to experience more hardships.  McCourt shares his experiences in life through humorous tone while describing his depressing way of life.  Francis tells the reader through the first-person narrative about his adventures and stories.  Although his father repeatedly wastes his few earnings in the pubs, Francis and his brothers look up to their father and look forward to hearing his stories of heroic Irishmen.  Within the memoir, McCourt's writing has the feel of a young boy and as he grows up his opinions on life develop to be more mature, giving you the feel that you are growing up along with Francis and are experiencing a similar lifestyle.  Much lighthearted wit is found within Francis's school experiences, where he learns about his religion and common sense when dealing with the other boys at school.  Francis comes down with a serious case of typhoid, requiring him to remain in the hospital for months where he develops a passion for Shakespeare.  His interest in Shakespeare's work brings him to strive in school.  Francis continues to carry on and preserver through life as he grows up...With the continuing cycle of lacking earnings brought home from Francis's father, Francis soon finds a job to support his family as World War I begins and his father is off in England looking for work.  Even with the witty writing of McCourt, the strong depressing subject matter of McCourt's childhood brings an overall heartbreaking and distressing mood upon the reader, \\"When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd sure be put in the middle of it,\\" (120).  After many family losses, home evictions, cold Irish nights, and foodless stomachs, Francis serves the family as a father figure and dreams of earning enough money to provide his family with food and clothing.

0307454894|5.0|This must be the year for books which have a profound effect. What genre this book fits I am unsure about. It could be one of many things: a holocaust novel, a philosphical exploration of collective and personal guilt, human nature, freedom and love, a love story, a coming-of age-novel. What I do know is that I have been deeply touched by the humanity of this novel, by the intense honesty and emotion in it. The writing is deeply touching, close and real, and I would say it would be near impossible to read this and not be drawn into the world of the characters.<br />The story deals with the weaving in and out of each others' lives of two people, Michael and Hanna, in post-Nazi Germany. Throughout the narrative some terrible secrets come to light and have to be dealt with. But it is much more than that...<br />Beside the main thread of the story, I was also fascinated by Schlink's treatment of the impact a relatively brief encounter can have on a person's life. An interesting subject of discussion indeed. The protagonists, Hanna and Michael's short time together would impact the rest of both of their lives to a significant, indeed determining degree. After marrying Gertrud, Michael cannot settle, even though during Hanna's trial he admits to feeling nothing, and being completely numb, \\"I could never stop comparing the way it was with Gertrud (his wife) to the way it had been with Hanna\\". He wants to be \\"free of Hanna\\", but finds himself incapable of escaping her memory and the guilt associated both with having been in a relationship with her as well as his notion that he somehow betrayed her. Here Hanna becomes a symbol for the old regime and Michael of the new Germany, the new world perhaps even, trying to break free of the past, and finding the task impossible to achieve. It raises the question: Can any person, group or nation ever break free from its past? Should one fight or deny that past? Or perhaps accept it, with its beauty and shame, and move from there? The answer is not given in the novel, but perhaps the answer is in the question and in the lives of Hanna and Michael. In each of our lives? Michael describes it perhaps when he muses on re-reading The Odyssey, \\"The Odyssey is the story of motion both purposeful and purposeless, successful and futile\\". And so perhaps are all of our lives as we live and breathe on this planet stories both successful and futile.<br />The book deals with the three different periods where Hanna and Michael's lives come together.<br />Part One of the book introduces the story powerfully, which gives the reader the persuasion to work through Part Two, which was much more harrowing. Schlink deals with a very difficult subject in this part of the book. He manages to be somehow objective without going flat, which is an incredible feat in itself. Part Three was for me the most powerful and touching acount imaginable. The expressions of love, the tone and feeling, the sense of irredeemable loss were so touchingly written that it sent shudders up my spine. That feeling of doing and choosing, but knowing it's not enough...<br />Is this ultimately a novel devoid of hope? Is there hope of redemption? Is it ever too late? Who is more guilty, the perpetrator, or the person who brings them to justice, looking for revenge? Do circumstances justify crime? Does shame? Is the choice not to choose a choice in itself? Can one ever love again, fully, after having loved once?<br />Schlink leaves the reader with so many unanswered questions. That's good, right? Thinking is good, especially when it hurts a little.<br />Perhaps I need to read this in the German though, even the title carries more meaning in German than in English. 'Vorlesen' means reading to someone out loud, not ever to onself, that is simply 'lesen'. The English does not make this distinction. I wonder what other nuance is lost...s not given in the novel, but perhaps the answer is in the question and in the lives of Hanna and Michael. In each of our lives?

B000M5AJQI|5.0|Buy this. Do it. This film is great, a great guy flick. Why do I say that? Well, because (and pardon my stereotyping) most women I know do not want to watch a movie that is positively full to the brim with foul language, headshots, and brutality.<br /><br />The reason why this is such a great movie is that it is also full of amazing acting, a rich plotline, and amazing direction. The stars are white hot, with Jack Nicholson giving an unbelievable performance as the main bad guy. Betrayal, greed, and wanting to be more than we are, all of these are themes in this great movie.<br /><br />You want this on Blu-Ray. Buy it.

0061689246|4.0|'Stardust' by Neil Gaiman is a children's book written for adults. It is a whimsical tale of a young man journeying into the realm of Faerie. The book is in the tradition of Lord Dunsany's 'The King of Elfland's Daughter'. It is very enjoyable despite (or because of?) its slight nature. The first two thirds of the book are excellent, until the confrontation at the inn. After this point many seemingly interesting things are mentioned only in passing while Gaiman rushes to the climax which, truthfully, was somewhat anticlimactic. Still these are minor points, the story as a whole is wonderful. Unfortunately I read the version without illustrations, if I had known before that there was versions with illustrations I definitely would have read that. I wish there was more of that in adult fantasy.

B001AEF6IQ|5.0|I've never watched a single episode of Dr. Who, so if you are feeling a bit undecided on TW because it's a spin-off of Dr.Who and you've never watched the Dr. any way, then don't be. I have been watching TW since the 1st episode and I love it. It has a lot of action, drama, humor and there is some same-sex snogging(kissing) so if that bothers you don't watch. It all centers around a group of people that work at TW an organization that was formed to deal with alien threats on Earth. There are a few TW offices and this one happens to be in Cardiff, where Captain Jack says there is a rift in time and \\"things\\" from \\"out there\\" keep popping up in Cardiff. The series begins with the introduction of Police Constable Gwen Cooper, our link to TW so to speak for we are as lost as Gwen is when she stumbles on them. There is Captain Jack Harkness a guy from the future and the past, Ianto Jones the \\"gopher\\" coffee/tea maker but he will become much more then that in due time, Owen the doctor and resident ladies man, Toshiko the computer wiz.  To give you an idea of the series here are the episodes and a brief discription, no spoilers promise,and rating 1star worst 5 stars great.:  Epi.1: Everything Changes- Gwen Cooper comes across TW, and Jack discovers that rules aren't always followed. 5*  Epi.2: Day One- TW has to stop a sex addicted alien as it leaves a trail of dead bodies.5*  Epi.3: Ghost Machine- Gwen gets hold of an alien object that gives you visions of past crimes.4*  Epi.4: Cyberwoman- Ther's a dark secret in the basement of the Hub. Even jack is unawareof it, but Ianto knows.And he'll go to any lengths, sacrifice anything and anyone, to protect what's down there.5*  Epi.5: Small Worlds- A withdrawn child has some very gruesome friends.4*  Epi.6: Countrycide- TW team goes investigating in a deserted village and find themselves out of their elements.5*  Epi.7: Greeks Bearing Gifts- Tosh gains the ability to read minds after receiving a special gift.4*  Epi.8: They KeepKilling Suzie- A series of murders are linked to Torchwood, Jack and the crew turn to the one thing that might help, resurrect Suzie Costello. But was this a fluke or does Suzie have other plans?5*  Epi.9: Random Shoes- The invisible spirit of a hit and run victim tries to convince Gwen to locate the alien that might have been responsible for his death.4*  Epi.10: Out of Time- A 1950's passenger plane arrives in 21st century Cardiff, can the TW team help them assimilate to modern life?5*  Epi.11: Combat- The team discovers a ring of that are kidnapping Weevils (aliens) for there own mixed up reasons.3*  Epi.12: Captain Jack Harkness- The Captain and Toshiko are transported to WWII Cardiff, there Toshiko soon finds out that being Japanese at this time is not that good and they meet the real Capt. Jack. Back in the present the rest of the team have to battle there own demons in order to find a way to bring their friends back, but things are going to go horribly wrong.5*  Epi.13: End of Days- The rift is splintering, strange things are happening all around the world.These events resemble those in the prophecy of the arrival of Abaddon, the Great Devourer, who will lead the world into shadow and bring about the End of Days...5*    So ends season 1 of this great series, I recommend you get it in Blu Ray because this is one of the few shows that is actually filmed in HD, and it looks incredible. I really like the interaction between the characters and the way they all seem like very rounded individuals and not paper cut outs. There are a lot of extras in these discs, they are full of lots of fun stuff.  Highly recommended.

Julie Waters' version of \\"Take a chance\\" is wonderful and Streep's \\"Winner takes it all\\" made me cry.  Granted, Brosnan's singing is a tad painful but it was passable.

1439102813|5.0|I didn't think I could buy this book, but in the past year I've been drawn to it no matter where I went, New York or Florida. I finally bought it online, and let it lay on my nightstand for days. I eyed it, thinking should I, or shouldn't I? Afraid to open it, to see what Lisa Genova had written. But I knew I had to, for I was an Alzheimer's caregiver for fourteen years, and we also had butterfly's in common.<br /><br />I read the first few pages, thinking Lisa doesn't have Alice down pat, not the way I had Carol (my friend) under a microscope. She doesn't know the way Alzheimer's steals everything in you; she doesn't know the denial and heartache; she couldn't, she didn't live it. After ten pages I put the book down. I picked it up a few days later in a different mood and frame of mind. One scene led me into another, \\"Alice stood in their bedroom, naked but for a pair of ankle socks and her Safe Return bracelet, wrestling and growling at the article of clothing stretched around her head. Like a Martha Graham dance, her battle against the fabric shrouding her head, looked like a physical and poetic expression of anguish. She let out a long scream.\\"<br /><br />This was how it happened. How could Lisa Genova know this? How could she know when Carol jumped over patches of dark floor tiles, that she thought they were black holes? Lisa is right on the mark with `Still Alice'. I know, because I lived watching it take my friend inch by inch and minute by minute.<br /><br />\\"Alice closed her eyes and pictured herself standing solidly in the middle of a plateau. A beautiful mesa. She could see it, and it was worth hoping for. Could John see it? Could he still hope for her, or had he already given up? Or worse, did he actually hope for her rapid decline, so he could take her, vacant and complaisant, to New York in the fall? Would he choose to stand with her on the plateau or push her down the hill?\\" I loved this paragraph with victim and caregiver together.<br /><br />Being a facilitator of an Alzheimer's caregiver support group, working with the elderly in assisted living and day care, and volunteering in nursing homes, this leaves me with an important question. I worry older people will read this thinking: `Oh, I lose my keys, I can't remember names, I get lost driving at times, Do I have Alzheimer's?<br /><br />I and so many others want this disease cured, not slowed down, but cured. Ms. Genova did a marvelous job with `Still Alice', putting herself in a victim's mind. It's hard to do, unless you've lived it, that's why I labeled this post Speeding Train.

B001GQSY5K|3.0|The characters work, the story is watchable -- already it beats 'The Phantom Menance' and 'Attack of the Clones'. Add some genuinely exciting action, a sexy new villianess and some tongue-in-cheek humour and you have a STAR WARS film.     The story follows the typical father/son Lucas path (what is with George and his daddy issues?), this time with Jabba the Hutt losing his slimy newborn. Anakin Skywalker and his new Jedi apprentice are sent to rescue the Huttlet as Obi-Wan Kenobi chats with Jabba.     Some of the dialogue is overdone or badly planned (for example, Obi-Wan assures his droid that \\"...I'm sure Jabba will be in a good mood\\" despite the fact that Jabba has recently lost his son!) and some characters remain wooden (Mace Windu badly needs a personality) but there is enough eye-candy and energy to keep viewers interested. Count Dooku finally establishes himself as a half-decent antagonist, but it is his slinky sidekick who steals the show.
0671027573|5.0|This is the book that got me interested in Linda Howard and it remains my favorite.  I have to agree with other reviews, Sam Donovan is a hottie and I particularly enjoy the car wash scene when Jaine deliberately squirts him-then soaks him... feel the heat! Another thing I like about Linda Howard books is that they're not just about romance, and not necessarily trivial mystery, but interesting to read.  If you only have time for one, this is the one I'd recommend.

B0000AK7AC|5.0|I rarely give a perfect score though I have given many 8's and 9's because I am extremely selective about which movies I watch. In this case babe really came through all the way to the end. Often movies can do well but kind of flub the ending by carrying on longer than the \\"Ah ha\\" moment. Babe however ended just right leaving you with glowing warm feelings.     Babe was entertaining, funny, somewhat thought provoking, and even a tad spiritual. Babe really prods the viewer to reconsider how they think about animals. Even though these animals are obviously anthropomorphized the movie still manages to break through our preconceptions.     I'm not sure how much of an animal rights bent this movie intended but for me it seemed obvious that deeper issues were implied. Ultimately though, even without much thought this is an easy movie to watch with its positive and wholesome values. I was heartened to see something so benign and at the same time well done movie (often a hard combination to be had) come out of Hollywood. In a time when it often seems almost anything goes this was a most welcome alternative.
013168728X|1.0|I took image processing in 2002 and this book was dated then.  I opened it only to do homework.  Otherwise I got my info elsewhere or from my notes.  I used Anil K Jain's \\"Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing\\" as an alternate text and it rocked. There was far too much text and far too little pictures, equations and examples to make this a good image processing text.  I didn't find their presentations algorithmic in the least.  I would have hated to try to use this as a guide to programming my image processing algorithms from.
1400097029|2.0|The book hinted at character development to come but, with no beautiful use of language and an absence of any gripping narration, I gave up after 40 pages. I bought this on the strength of its winning the booker prize but it seems that even prize committees can make mistakes.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|While this is something of a \\"kids\\" movie, it actually touches on a lot of important issues related to our wasteful and pacifying consumer culture.  The scenes of the endless piles of trash were reminiscent of a documentary I saw on waste [[ASIN:B000TRH4CQ TRASHED]].  Raging dust storms, a space mall for heavy Americans to amuse themselves to death, and questions of robots taking over society are among the other dark topics of this film; which, amazingly, remains funny and offers a hopeful message.

1439102813|5.0|There is no more frightening disease today than Alzheimer's Disease, especially in its early onset manifestation. There are many informative books about Alzheimer's Disease out there and several are even engagingly written. But unless you have been personally affected by Alzheimer's Disease or have a particular interest for some other reason these non-fiction works may hold little meaning, only information. In Still Alice Lisa Genova has crafted a tragic vision of the havoc this disease wreaks in a life, but also of the moments of grace and humor along the way. From the first page, the reader is pulled into the tragedy, the growing enormity and the raw emotion of the lives and relationships that are profoundly and forever challenged and changed by Alzheimer's Disease. And along the way we learn some information about this devastating disease too.    Genova pulls no punches as she weaves an engaging tale of the doomed heroine, Alice, and of those who share her life and work. It does not matter one wit that Alice is a brilliant and well respected Harvard Psychology Professor, a beautiful wife and loving mother, Alzheimer's Disease will have its way. As it subdues Alice, we see the layers of the onion that together are her full self peeled away from the inside out and as this happens we witness the loneliness that many of those living with Alzheimer's must endure. The friends, colleagues and students that once were so much a part of who Alice was in the world and how she identified herself are no longer there, they have gone on without her - she has been abandoned, a phenomenon called \\"social abandonment.\\"    If you've never read a book about Alzheimer's Disease, you must start with this book. If you've read other books about Alzheimer's Disease, you should read this book too. If you've only seen a film about Alzheimer's you must especially read this book. Alzheimer's Disease is a fatal disease and therefore there is no Lance Armstrong of Alzheimer's who has beaten thedisease and lives on as an example for us all of how to conquer it and go on to live lives that are more full and meaningful now than before the disease. Until that day we have only stories such as the one written by Lisa Genova which can even come close to giving us some sense of what it might be like.

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Javier Bardem is always good and solid, and the Spanish locations are gorgeous. The music is nicely chosen too.  However, there's a big problem with much of the dialogue, which does not seem authentic; there is no logic to Cristina wanting to stay with the nasty Maria Elena and her ex-husband Juan Antonio; there's no logic, either, in Vicky wanting to go off with J.A. after she's just gotten married; the narration is incredibly annoying and unnecessary.  Woody Allen can do much better than this.

It stands on it's own and is incredible both in terms of characters, story line and action.  It was the perfect SciFi movie.

Their performance were stellar and humanized these two icons perfectly without making us hate them.  It is long, but so was the book. A life like theirs takes time in the telling.  Well worth it all.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|This is my first arm.  I bought it basically to test the product and, so far so good.  I can't compare it to others, but it holds my 19 inch dell without the slightest hint of a problem.  I have no doubt it would hold a 22 incher just as well.  Rotate, tilt, raise, lower, pull forward, push back...whatever.  This arm allows you to orient your monitor in any number of ways.  It is very well built, solid, and suitably heavy.  I'm using the clamp to hold to the rear of my desk and its solid.  If you're a keyboard banger the vibration does indeed transfer a bit to the monitor through the arm, but it isn't anything annoying and you quickly compensate.  All in all a very good product.  I have no reason to give it less than five stars.    Update (2009/05/27): With a bit of tightening (I had to loosen stuff to be able to move my 19inch Dell) this arm holds my new 24-inch HP LP2475 ([[ASIN:B001FS1LLI HP LP2475W 24in LCD Monitor 1920X1200]]) rock solid.  I think I need to loosen a bit though ... it may a bit too rock solid!  So, although not recommended by Ergotron (their site selection tool points to the higher model) this arm can at least hold the HP LP2475.  Although it may be at its limit (for the tilt joint).

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I am a huge fan of NCIS: all the seasons have depth, wit, and humor, but by far, season 4 is my favorite. People say this season is too complicated or there was too much drama involved: it's true: season 4 is definitely different from the previous seasons, but I (and this is my personal opinion) enjoyed the more depth of the characters: you see alot of growth: for example, you really get to see the goodness of Tony: he still has that ego, but he also can truly care. The interaction between Abby and McGee as always is fantastic and of course, Gibbs is Gibbs. With this season, you also get to know Jenny's character a little more.    This by far is my favorite season: NCIS is great.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I was never interested in the four-DVD Alien series as a whole.  Although the first movie is a classic, the second is the best of the quartet, and the third and fourth -- well, the less said about them the better.  I also wasn't interested in just the \\"special edition\\" version -- I wanted to be able to watch the additional scenes, or not watch them, as I chose without having to perpetually play with my remote.    So this?  This was perfect.  Combining the classic theatrical release of Aliens with the additional scenes (which all work, save for the initial scene with Newt's family), along with an additional DVD with tons of extras and documentary footage?  Excellent!    Moreover, the sound and video transfer is top-notch.

IMHO, the \\"author\\" should not have been given full writing responsibilities. His self aware, self conscious style is annoying as his constant, singularity in thought. How many times did he use the descriptive word \\"escarpment\\" to describe his surroundings??? I stopped counting at one dozen. He's not a writer and his pompus perspective about the goings-on at his family's East Texas ranch was, well, vomitous. Sorry folks, I can think of many, many other books about war to read, written by authors who know how to articulate an intelligent thought behind their content.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|I love movies that give me a lot to think about, but don't skimp on action. Most of all, I love the themes in this movie. It's a study of good versus evil-both external and internal, with responsible, useful conclusions. All that.

0375704027|4.0|There was a lot of sex in \\"Norwegian Wood.\\"<br />A spectrum of sex, in the reasons why people share it with each other.<br /><br />There was the kind of sex you have when you're drunk and lose your inhibitions; the kind where you frivolously do it for the sake of doing it with as many people willing to do it with you, while bar crawling, as possible; the kind where there's no penetration, but a lot of touching and licking; the kind you have to consummate a long-winded desire to do it with someone you've liked for a long time; and the kind where the actual 'act' is withheld for the sake of chivalry and promised loyalty.<br /><br />There was even post-death mourning sex and on-the-screen-while-in-seats sex. There was flashback sex, losing-virginity-on-your-birthday sex, and jerking-off-while-thinking-about-sex-you've-had sex.<br /><br />This book was also about a boy who liked a crazy girl, and then liked a few other crazy girls, while the first crazy girl slowly lost her mind before giving all over her clothes to her roommate.<br /><br />And sometimes there were spurts of really decent prose.<br /><br />I said \\"spurts.\\" (haha...) *sigh

2253150711|5.0|Recently, I have been been trying to recover my French language abilities.  A Belgian friend of mine recommended this book to me after we saw that Amelie Nothomb was coming to D.C. to promote some of her newer books.  I ordered this and another of her books so I would be familiar with some of her works before we went to her promotional interview that was held at the D.C.  Alliance Francaise.    This book was a very quick and funny read.  It was at the perfect level for my rusty French skills too.  It really reels you in quickly and keeps you reading.  The author was very funny in person too.  She is an amazing person that from an early age traveled all over Asia and other parts of the world with her Belgian Diplomat parents.  I recommend this book as a quick funny easy read.  I am eager to read more of this unique and intelligent lady's books too.  I highly recommend seeing her in person as well.  She is a beautiful and very entertaining person.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|I am a mom of a soon to be 6 year old. We have both loved the first two movies that were on Disney so when we hear the third one was coming out in the theater we were thrilled! Needless to say, since I had bought my daughter the cd in advance, by the time we went to see the movie, she was singing the songs and bopping to the music the whole time in the theater. I was a big fan as well. Highly recommended for kids as well as parents!!!
B001N26GFM|5.0|I know that many movie critics bombed this movie, but you really need to decide for yourself.<br /><br />I thought this movie was very well made, the acting was excellent, and the story was very intriguing. I have read the book the movie is based from, and the movie follows the book very closely.<br /><br />I have to say my favorite part of the movie is the music - the soundtrack is amazing! It was made by the same composer that did the soundtrack for Titanic and Braveheart, to name a few.<br /><br />Be prepared for a shocking ending - some don't like it, but I did. I think it's a realistic approach to the Holocaust - not every story has a happy ending.
0452289963|4.0|What passes for normal in man (and organizations) is actually a form of madness, says the author, madness that could lead to the extinction of our species. And this madness begins, he says, with the illusory sense of self that he calls \\"the ego.\\" It is a sort of self-consciousness, sense of separateness from the rest of creation, self-importance, that underlies most human experience and thought process. Unfortunately it often leads to the sense that I (and my group) are right, others are wrong, and that leads to terrible and dangerous conflict. Realizing this madness for what it is, is the beginning of enlightenment, by whatever terminology we wish to call it. And perhaps, also, the survival of our kind.<br /><br />Such is the gist of author Tolle's book. He explains early on that his goal is not merely to inform the reader about these concepts, but to change the reader's consciousness. Ambitious goal. Does he achieve it? You will have to decide for yourself, after reading the book, of course. A lot will depend on the reader's own state of mind, or readiness for this transformation.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, much of this material is well known in the spiritual traditions, very little is original. Still, originality isn't everything, is it? The author writes elegantly and clearly, making the inexpressible understandable, with down-to-earth explanations and often with sparks of good humor. I enjoyed this book more the more I read. Did it change me? Well, it got me to noticing some things about myself in a new and somewhat disturbing way. So, I would say, Yes. I'm delighted that I found and read this book, and I recommend it to you as well. But, be warned. It's not for everybody. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.
B0007ZEO4G|3.0|I loved Purple's Mk. II lineup and I think the band cranked out its greatest album (\\"Deep Purple In Rock\\") when Ian Gillan was at the mic. But do I think DP suffered when Gillan and Roger Glover were replaced by David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes? Absolutely not! \\"Burn\\" is one action-packed barnstormer of an album, marred (in my opinion) only by the goofy, unconvincing white boy swagger of 'What's Goin' On Here' and the sore-thumb instrumental '\\"A\\" 200'. The entire band is in excellent form, especially on the title track (which is my single favorite Deep Purple song)--but also on 'Sail Away', 'You Fool No One', and the monumental slow blues 'Mistreated'. The interplay between Ritchie Blackmore's guitar and Jon Lord's organ is fantastic, of course, but the reviewer who singled out Ian Paice's drumming for particular praise is right--Paice is nothing short of breathtaking on \\"Burn\\".  The boogie influences that Coverdale and Hughes brought to Deep Purple would later become too obtrusive, especially on \\"Come Taste the Band\\". But \\"Burn\\", while not quite the equal of \\"In Rock\\" or \\"Machine Head\\", is a damned fine record. If you love the early work of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, \\"Burn\\" belongs in your collection, too.

B000002UE9|4.0|Considered by many as their best album, \\"Open Up and Say...Ahh!\\" was the premier glam metal record of its era and solidified Poison's reign over this much maligned genre.  No song better describes the band and the era's philosophy than lead single \\"Nothin' But a Good Time\\" which for me was one of the anthems of that summer. Being  19 and single, I totally understood that to read to deeply into these lyrics was the antithesis of what the summertime was about. Too bad many of the band's legion of critics also didn't get it! \\"Love on the Rocks\\", \\"Good Love\\" and \\"Tearing Down the Walls\\" continued the libido explosion that the late 80's stood for and remain my favorites from this record. The most famous song is undoubtedly \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" which pretty much remained the most notorious power ballad of the hair metal era. `Open Up' isn't my favorite Poison record (I prefer `Flesh & Blood', more um.....mature(hee hee)) but it continues the progression of Poison's glam revolution and made the Brett, Rikki, Bobby and CC for better or for worse household names...things your doin' ain't natural boy!

B000OQF6N6|3.0|People that compare this album to other Pumpkins albums are obviously going to think this sucks. Forget who made this album for a second though and then judge it. The first 5 songs here are solid. Doomsday Clock sounds huge and is my favorite song on it except maybe Tarantula. The only problem with the first half I thought, was that it didn't flow very well. The second half though, is a completely different story. I feel like United States could've been done in half the time it took, Starz is painful to sit through, and the rest of the songs are pretty cliche but listenable.     I heard the singles before I bought this and was stoked to get it. This is the last time I buy something based off of the singles. I love early Pumpkins but I really liked Adore too. I feel like they should've kept going in that direction because it was a solid, new direction. Hearing Corgan's solo album (which is mostly electronic based if you haven't heard it), I think he wanted to keep going in that direction, but didn't think he could do it with the Pumpkins, so he panicked and went back to guitar and everything from there on became uninspired. I don't know, maybe I'm overanalyzing but it makes sense to me.     I would definitely get the first 5 or so songs off Zeitgeist but anything after that would be money better spent somewhere else. It's definitely not a 5 or even 4 star album, but it's not as bad as a lot of people here are saying.

0316017922|4.0|Fun facts and lots of interesting theories. Gladwell begins his thesis with a clear and practically irrefutable statistical demonstration showing that an overwhelmingly out of proportion number of elite Canadian hockey players were born in the first three months of the calendar year. Since the junior leagues have an age cutoff at January 1, the speculation is that at young ages the extra months of growth these lucky-birthed kids have makes it more likely that they will shine over their younger peers. This distinction gets compounded in hockey over time, as these kids get better coaching, more ice time, etc.<br /><br />Gladwell further builds his case by relating a fuller version of the Bill Gates story than the one that is usually told, specifically mentioning the access to computer time at his high school that was rare even for colleges in the day. Similarly he describes the same kind of benefit for the founder of Sun Microsystems, and then he lays out the history of some of the most powerful law firms in the world in New York and how they were no smarter than many other firms. After a half dozen or more such example a pattern begins to appear to even the most obtuse thinker- namely that \\"outliers\\" are not just talented and intelligent, but also extremely hard working and sometimes a bit lucky as much of their success required the presence of factors that were completely outside of their control. They were smart and driven, but also born in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />At this point you might begin to ask if this is simply another \\"Nature vs. Nurture\\" book, and I think to a large degree it is, with Gladwell coming down pretty strongly on the side of nurture. This was evidenced especially in his discussion of IQ, where he makes the claim that IQ scientists, whatever they are, believe only 50% of IQ is inherited. I'm sure there are some out there who say that, as there always someone who will say just about anything, but most studies I've read put the percentage much, much higher. Even his own anecdotal example of a genius IQ was a guy who could hardly have been more disadvantaged had he been raised by wolves, yet he was reading by age three and eventually tested out with a 195 IQ.<br /><br />This kind of non-fatal flaw shows up from time to time and demonstrates a bit of the same weakness he finds in much conventional wisdom, that is basing a conclusion on an initial faulty assumption, or developing one theory when another might serve just as well. I'd give the old analogy of an onion- he has peeled back a layer, but he has stopped there and hasn't proven (and granted it would be a difficult thing to prove) that it is the last layer.<br /><br />Another odd theory to me came to light with his analysis of cultural variations, especially over the \\"honor cultures\\" present in some regions. He explains the Hatfield's and McCoy's and other mountain feuds as a continuation of the Scotch-Irish tradition of being concerned about reputation and combines it with a study in Michigan showing Southerners as extremely quick to take offense. I personally found that ridiculous, and I'll whip anybody that says otherwise right here right now.<br />Seriously, the Michigan study seemed almost anecdotal to me, and then he also misses the obvious fact that most of the South is not  mountainous, Appalachian or otherwise, and for that matter a big chunk of the Appalachians actually runs north of the Mason-Dixon line. He got overly ambitious trying to prove this point, I thought and his theory comes off a little half-baked.<br /><br />Still there is lots of interesting analysis and he writes incredibly well, with such a polish that you really don't want the book to end. He didn't convince me on every point, but that didn't stop me from finding the book extremely entertaining.h, much higher.

B001DEVZUG|4.0|I was really looking forward to seeing somethnig really special on the DVD, but the videos for \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\" and \\"Pavement Cracks\\" are a total letdown. \\"ATBT\\" is dubbed from the \\"Bare\\" album and contains no live recording. \\"PC\\" is even worse cos the audio obviously comes from the album and is playing through while Annie is just standing there moving her hand slightly, to the beat, and not singing much, but appearing to be doing a lot of \\"oooooooh\\" as you can tell, by the facial expressions she's making. \\"Little Bird\\" is a fun video and it's nice to finally have it on DVD. Can't understand why it never appeared on Annie's \\"Totally Diva\\" video collection DVD.<br /><br />There are a lot of great videos and the DVD showcases Annie's flawless ability to change her looks & style from one video to the next. I don't appreciate not being able to skip from one vid to the next. Even on my computer, the videos cannot be skipped until each one finishes, and then you can choose which one you want to see, from the menu. Seems the DVD wasn't truly thoughtfully put together. This compilation does terminate Annie's BMG contract, and I think it's more a fluke on the record company's side, rather than on Annie herself. Why would such a truly devoted artist & woman want to make her fans unhappy? I honestly don't believe the poor quality of the DVD is Annie's fault one bit, that's for sure.<br /><br />As for the packaging itself, the discs are going to be subject to a lot of wear & tear because they are so tightly packed into the front and back covers of the package, they will get scratched and worn very fast. I took my discs out of their tight confinement and placed them in a suitable double sleeve which fits both discs. This, I placed inside the digipack.<br />The booklet (attached to the right panel of the item, contains neat pics and all the lyrics & Annie's sentiments on each song.

Oh, and I wanted to say, in the amazon description of this item, it says there are the videos + more, on the DVD. What else is there supposed to be? Am I missing something? I say, buy the \\"CD Only\\" edition, if you're looking for quality. The CD only edition is housed in a jewelcase. Otherwise, get this deluxe edition, because if you don't already have at least the \\"Totally Diva\\" DVD, at least you'll have most of the material from it, on this DVD now.

Oh, and I wanted to say, in the amazon description of this item, it says there are the videos + more, on the DVD. What else is there supposed to be? Am I missing something? I say, buy the \\"CD Only\\" edition, if you're looking for quality. The CD only edition is housed in a jewelcase. Otherwise, get this deluxe edition, because if you don't already have at least the \\"Totally Diva\\" DVD, at least you'll have most of the material from it, on this DVD now. Both DVDs are good to have though, if you're a true Annie collector.

B00005MJ13|5.0|Had some fun comparing Dvorák 9ths lately. My favourite four are/remain the same, in ascending order: Bernstein/NYP (1962) takes the Largo too slowly (admittedly to great effect), then the Scherzo at a breakneck pace (impressively but unnecessarily so, I'm afraid), a fun reading, well-executed and -recorded. Fricsay/BPO (1959) is broad, dramatic, weighty, well-played and -recorded. Ancerl/CPO (1961) sounds the most Czech and idiomatic of all, a lithe, lean and agile reading whose sound quality comes out very well in the most recent remasterings (also available as XRCD). Kertész/VPO (1961) brings together the best qualities of them all, and still sounds great in the latest Japanese remastering (also available as Esoteric SACD hybrid, which I haven't heard yet), and remains my top favourite (but I like interpretive variety, which one will get on the highest quality level owning all four of these recordings). The Kertész/LSO (1966) sounds curiously \\"flat\\" (as others have observed here and elsewhere) in comparison, too much of a déjà vu perhaps, but it's still in the league (or close) of other good recordings, such as those by Horenstein, Kubelik, Neumann, Reiner, Szell and Talich.    Great remastering, by the way, probably the best this recording has got so far. Wholeheartedly recommended, even as an only version (not my thing, though). Nice fillers (other 9ths come without any), by the way, with the 1960 Moldau and 1959 Liszt Les Préludes possibly my favourite recordings each.    Greetings from Switzerland, David.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|When Edward Albee in 1962 published his latest play \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\", Broadway was in an uproar. Never before such foul language was heard on a stage and the topics it touched on were not exactly of a nature likely to be discussed as explicitly outside the privacy of one's home if ever for that matter. A nomination of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize was, also due to its vocabulary, denied.    Together with Tennessee Williams' play \\"A Streetcar named Desire\\" this play is nowadays seen as the most important post-war (the second one) play in US history.      Four years after its publication in 1966 a movie adaptation was undertaken by Mike Nichols and as it was his directorial debut the studio was taking a chance. (A few years down the road Nichols would win a first Oscar for \\"The Graduate\\")    The movie was awarded two Oscars because of two of its four leads: Elizabeth Taylor as best actress in the part of Martha (and never was an award more deserved!!!) and Sandy Dennis as best supporting actress playing Honey. To this day (and I believe I'm not alone in this) I consider it an outrage that at the very least Richard Burton wasn't given an Oscar for best actor as George, but in the end I guess that's all not very important.     Both Taylor and Burton in this movie probably are giving their best performance ever as Martha and George, who are having a marriage to put it charmingly like a sewer, that time and again they relish opening up again with a sick satisfaction playing an eternal game of truth and illusion, that both have lost their way in such a long time ago that any sense of perspective has vanished.    The movie starts with Martha and George on a university campus, where George teaches in the History department while Martha is the daughter of the University's dean, as they are walking home after a social event that has left them both rather drunk and soon, as they get home, in a mood out for blood.    Like the play the movie has three acts, central to each of them is a \\"game\\":  Humiliate the Host   University's latest newcomers Nick (George Segal) and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) arrive at George and Martha's house to brighten up the evening. One could argue they may represent what George and Martha were like early in their relationship while in reverse George and Martha would be the young couple's ultimate nightmare of their future, though it would constitute a gross simplification, but it's an interesting question to ponder.   During the game at hand George and Martha ruthlessly attack each other verbally to the utter dismay of their guests, who, also imbued by alcohol consumption, take turns being either shocked and transfixed by their hosts. Each game has its rules and when Martha breaks one by talking to Honey about their (George and Martha's) son, George counters with a series of verbal blows against Martha that well and truly start a bloody battle between them.    Get the Guest   The guests however are not left out in all this and when Nick in an inebriated state entrusts George with a painful private secret, George uses it mercilessly against him, when Nick, ignoring George's warnings, encourages Martha in yet another humiliating tirade of hers.  The young couple is in shock and hurt. Martha and George make a declaration to each other of all out total war.    Bringing up Baby   The final game is a crushing psychological check-mate attempt by George against Martha relating to the truth about their son.  The ultimate shattering of the illusion and naked vulnerability of the truth is, having avoided it for years, even more frightful.  Martha's answer to George's final question \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" unsurprisingly is: \\"I am George, I am\\".    The couple has arrived at the beginning of new kind of truth and by surrendering the illusion a careful step is made towards a future both uncertain and without any guarantee of happiness, but at least with a glimmer of hope.     This impressive play/movie illustrates the raw feelings in a turbulent relationship, created around a secret of personal loss so painful, that the pain had to go somewhere to survive it and so both partners inflicted it on each other. Finally, worn out from years of battle, there is nowhere left to go but face the truth about themselves and look at each other to find the bravery to try and make a new choice, try a new path.

031606792X|5.0|I was very pleased with all the Twilight books. Stephenie Meyer is a very talented writer and I look forward to reading other books of hers.<br /><br />I would also recommend these books for your teenage (tween) children. My daughter is an avid reader and she enjoyed the book so much . . . she read them all twice!

Now I'm seeing more things as games and becoming convinced that this approach holds many keys in how I want to structure things.  This is the best book I've read in several years.

B000FVNX2Q|3.0|Certainly a decent calculator and speedier than the regular 12C. However the operation of keys are a disappointment. These new 12C calcs do not have the solid feel and smooth key operation the original 12C calcs had. My suggestion, buy a like-new used old 12C from eBay instead of a new one. hp chepened this one up and still charges a premium.<br /><br />In general a tip for the novice. The Texas Instruments BA2 Plus Professional is much easier to use and has a better interface, especially for amortization schedules. The 12C is better for very complex finacial calcualtions but it will take lots of training to use it for these. If you just want to do simple TVM calculations, I would recommend the TI BA2 Plus Professional anytime.
B000TENNME|1.0|Referring to the MP3 downloaded version of this.  I didn't download this whole thing, but I did get Opportunities-Original 12\\" Mix... and it skips!  About 1:42-1:43 into it.  It's like listening to a defective record (for all you youngsters out there who don't know what that is, records were the form of media that we old folks had to put up with before CD's came along (and for you even younger kids, CD's were what we had to put up with before MP3's came along)).  Anyway, Amazon very kindly refunded the purchase amount.  But I would have preferred a non-defective version.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|There's no doubt that Christopher Nolan took great care in his creation of \\"The Dark Knight\\".  He corrected one of the key mistakes he made in \\"Batman Begins\\"--shooting the fight sequences from the outside of the fights as opposed to being in the middle of the rumbles.    But what seems lost in the many discussions of this movie--the performance of Ledger, whether or not Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent was necessary (I believe he was), and the length of the movie--is how Christopher and Jonathan Nolan meshed three Batman tales--\\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" (Which has become a base for ANY Batman story), \\"The Killing Joke\\" from 1988, and the \\"No Man's Land\\" storyline from 1999--and have made not just a superhero movie, but a masterful character study of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne.    The basis of the Batman/Joker dynamic is, and always has been, that Batman never gets a pure victory over the Joker, that somehow the Joker always--especially in this production--has the proverbial card up his sleeve.  I strongly believe that Bob Kane would approve of that view.  Being as that Bale's Wayne is not so much millionaire with a secret identity as he is a man with split (if not multiple) personas, this seems unsettling.  What the Nolans have done in the screen play is shown three Bruces--the playboy who dates models and ballerinas and sleeps at board meetings, the gravel-voiced vigilante we all know and love, and the Bruce who controls the two--the one who wants to get Gotham going in the right direction, and then settle down to a life with Rachel Dawes (Embodied with much more spunk here by Maggie Gyllenhal than Katie Holmes).    This is what makes this movie fascinating to watch from a psychological standpoint.  Bruce is fighting for the better Gotham, but also for his own better life.  But the city is so far gone--something Rachel understands--that not even Bruce's belief in Harvey Dent can save Wayne, and by extension, the city.  Throw into the mix an agent of chaos--the Joker--and this movie becomes a dark, melancholy work that ultimately is heroically sad.  Once again, this is a well-acted story.  Bale--who follows this by becoming John Connor this year in \\"Terminator:Salvation\\"--isn't ducking the emotionally/mentally scarred characters, and is throwing his physical presence into them.  Ledger...may permanently have wiped the image of Cesar Romero in the 1960's pancaking his face to hide his mustache, or the \\"Jack as Joker\\" in 1989.  Michael Caine's Alfred is a far more active and thoughtful character than Micheal Gough's Alfred in the Burton/Schumacher series; certainly more the surrogate father many of us are used to in the storyline.  Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon is also a notch up--world-weary, knowing, and understanding his working relationship with the Bat...isn't normal, but a necessary evil.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox is fun--that he knows and openly works with Bruce on tech for Batman's usage (Something not acknowledged for years in the print lineage) is a hoot.  As I said, I strongly believe that Aaron Eckhart's turn as Harvey Dent is pivotal.  Dent is the embodiement of what Bruce wants to believe Gotham could and should be.  His destruction--both physical and mental/emotional--is the saddest part of the story in many ways.  If we consider this the second part of (what we assume to be) Nolan's Batman trilogy (Again, assuming that this is a three-part story), this is the part that allows us to see that for all of his will, fighting skills, abilities of deduction...that Bruce Wayne is human, and all humans can fail.  Batman may capture the Joker, but the costs to himself and the city are catastrophic.  We don't know if Bruce and Gotham can recover from those losses.  But I would suspect that we will be finding out in the 2011 timeframe...
1400082773|5.0|The book was in excellent shape.  Someone recommended it to me. Now I am highly recommending it to others.   It was so interesting that I couldn't put it down until I finished all 454 pages.  How refreshing to have a president who comes from modest means, who is intellectual, and is a caring person.  I learned so much about President Obama and am so happy he is our president.
0765348276|5.0|This book and the whole trilogy is excellent.  I've been reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy for 20+ years and this trilogy is honestly what I consider one of the best trilogies I have read.  I rate it among the top best like the Foundation series, the I, Robot etc..  And I don't do this lightly but Scalzi really understands what makes an excellent Sci-Fi novel.  Hopefully his next series is as strong and he is among a wave of new writers that \\"get it\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this TV series!  It's a combination of science fiction (better than Star Trek) and the old west.  That's a strange combination, but it works for me.  It's important to start at the beginning of the series because early episodes build a base to work from.  Serenity, the movie, is great also, but you need to see the Firefly series first to really enjoy it.  Firefly is one of the few DVDs that I can watch over and over and still enjoy it.  Give it a try.  It's great!
0786948523|3.0|This MM is probably one of the weaker MMs I've read.  Unfortunately with such a new system (4E) you almost have no choice but to buy this thing so you have a starting point on how to build monsters.  The descriptions are lacking a lot of the background/history of the monsters that all the other MMs had which is the most disappointing thing about this MM.  And I found that monsters aren't as powerful as they were in previous editions, especially 3E.  Look at the stats for Orcus in this book.  He's nice but compared to 3E he's nothing.  In 3E he was a force of nature and in this one he's powerful, but I wouldn't call him a force of nature.  Felt this way about a lot of the monsters.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a great movie!  Be sure to watch the Firefly TV series first though.  Each of the TV episodes builds a base of understanding that is important to really enjoy the movie.

B001E1EOQ0|5.0|I was a little leery about buying this import title from Amazon because I was not sure where it was from and if it was all region or not.  Well, let me tell you, it is a fantastic Blu-Ray all the way around!    This Blu-Ray version comes from:     - TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT SOUTH PACIFIC, AUSTRALIA  - ALL REGION    It comes in a slightly wider Blu-Ray case than the US Blu-Rays but basically looks the same.  It is the same height and depth as all of your other cases, it is just about 1 1/2 times wider.  It also comes in a cardboard style slip-case.  I also have \\"Almost Famous\\" from the UK and that title is in the same slightly wider case.    The picture was just fantastic and as good as any Blu-Ray I have in my collection or that I have rented.  The sound was also really great.  The DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO is pristine and one of the best sounding soundtracks I have heard yet.  Plenty of clean LFE especially in the music scenes.    The video and audio included on the disc are as follows:    - English DTS-HD Master Audio  - French DTS 5.1  - German DTS 5.1  - English Commentary DD 2.0    The video is presented in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio and I don't know for sure but would assume AVC.    It is a BD-50: Dual Layer Disc    There is a second disc of special features.  I did not put this disc in because I personally don't care about most special features.  But it is a two-disc set.    Great movie (5 out of 5), (10 out of 10) or (4 stars of 4 stars).  Whichever method of rating you use, this is as close to a perfect biopic as you can get.    If you want to wait for the US BD version... go ahead.  If you love this movie and can't wait to see it in the best available format...     I can highly recommend this Aussie Import version.
0312323867|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and very much recommend it. I am still deciding which book I like better, but I don't think I am going to choose.  I like them both equally for their own reasons.  I tried not to hate either character in either book, because what I think makes a good author is one that can really develop the characters - even if you don't like them.  The situation in both books is sad, but it was great to read how the characters (in this book, Darcy) grew as individuals.  And even though the friendship was not fully repaired, it didn't leave you sad.  But then I was thinking that each character was flawed in her own way, and perhaps their friendship was as well.      I really think Emily Giffin is a fantastic writer.  Whether you relate to the character or not, it is near impossible to not get to know the character. Great book!

B001ACH4DS|2.0|David Cook has a trememdous voice as demonstrated on American Idol, but this CD is akin to listening to the same song over and over and over.  The song selection does no favors to his voice.  Where is \\"soulful\\" David?!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Enough said.  The movie is absolutely amazing!  I have 3 kids, and all of them will sit through this movie.  The visuals are stunning, the music is incredible and the story line is the best Disney has done.  The fact that Mulan is not a 'typical' Disney princess makes me enjoy this movie.  I'm a grown woman, but there are moments when I find myself tearing up.  The gang of three provide the right amount of humor.  Mushu is the only likable 'animal' character from Disney since Sebastian the crab from \\"The Little Mermaid\\".  What's best about this movie?  No dashing Princes swooping into the save the day!  Mulan proves herself to be a hero by using her brain and her wits, not her feminine charms!  I think they did a brilliant job reflecting Chinese culture and not making a mockery out of the original story.  Bravo Disney!

B000EAT246|4.0|It's amazing how great a movie is when one does not see it on network tv padded every 15 minutes with commercials. Anything shown on TBS and TNT has commercials of  upcoming programming  popping up every two seconds at the corner of the tv screen, is the worst thing these days. Thank the gods for home video, dvd & blu-ray etc. BLUE THUNDER is one of those forgotten treasures and what a joy it is to watch on a big sceen tv, letterboxed, and with full stereo.  A great action thriller that could have fit well with those great paranoid political thrillers of the 70's (released in 1983). Roy Scheider in one of his best roles upstaged lovingly by an urban-assault-helicopter. Underneath all the action is a social statement of urban crime and who controls it. It's a shame that the tv-series (starring James Farentino & Dana Carvey) didn't do as well.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Katy Perry's breakout hit I Kissed A Girl has apparently been a mixed blessing for her. Though it got her attention, it alson seems to have prevented certian critics from taking her seriously. Rolling Stone, for example only gave the CD two stars. All Music Guide commented, \\"Miss Perry's heart is not in it.\\" and it's true this  song is a bit of attention grabbing brazenness. But these critics seem unable to get past this to judge the rest of the album fairly. I thought it was pretty good. Her best songs are very bright and unbeat It reminded me somewhat of the ting tings debut, which Rolling stone reviewed favorably. And the CD's one ballad, Thinking Of You is quite beatiful. Believe me, Katy Perry is worth a listen.

It has fantastic imagery, great music and David Attenborough.<br /><br />I have a lot to say about how fantastic this series is, but that won't be necessary seeing as how the 1,982 (and counting) reviews have already sufficiently covered that.<br /><br />However, I have not seen the content of this box-set covered in depth, so I'll do so here...<br /><br />PLANET EARTH<br /><br />DISC 1<br /><br />FROM POLE TO POLE: The introduction to the series looks at our planet as a whole and considers the key factors that have shaped its natural history. Without fresh water there is no life on land, while the sun dominates the lives of all animals and plants on Earth and defines their habitats.<br /><br />MOUNTAINS: This tour of our mightiest mountain ranges, starting with the birth of a mountain at one of the lowest places on Earth and ending at the summit of Everest, takes in some of the most reclusive creatures on the planet and reveals the secrets of their survival.<br /><br />FRESH WATER: This episode follows the descent of rivers from their mountain sources to the sea and showcases the unique and dramatic wildlife found within Earth's unexplored waters. Together the waterfalls, canyons, frozen lakes, wetlands, and great rivers form a world of mystery, excitement and awe-inspiring sights.<br /><br />DISC 2<br /><br />CAVES: Deep in an undiscovered world, including both poisonous and flooded caves, we find astonishing crystals; cave anglerfish; the five million bats of Deer Cave in Borneo; and troglodytes - weird creatures, like the Texas cave salamander, that never see daylight nor set foot on the surface.<br /><br />DESERTS: Deserts, which make up a staggering 30% of the land's surface, seem empty and lifeless, yet they are the most varied of our planet's ecosystems. With remarkable footage Planet Earth unravels the secrets behind desert survival and for the first time on such a scale, reveals the ephemeral nature of the desert environment.<br /><br />ICE WORLDS: The advance and retreat of polar ice is the real challenge to life. As the sea freezes in Antarctica all animals flee, except for the Emperor Penguin. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the polar bear is forced to swim vast distances and take on one of the deadliest adversaries on the planet.<br /><br />DISC 3<br /><br />GREAT PLAINS: On these immense wildernesses, from the baking savannahs of Africa to the frozen tundra of the Arctic, we find the greatest gatherings of wildlife on Earth; but close on the heels of gazelles, caribou or wildebeest comes an array of plains predators... eagles, wolves and lions.<br /><br />JUNGLES: With little seasonality and a longer growing period, jungles are the most productive places on Earth, but surviving in the jungle is far from easy. Using state-of-the-art tracking shots and stunning aerials, Planet Earth moves along the dark forest floor, up through the layers of vegetation and across the canopy.<br /><br />SHALLOW SEAS: Planet Earth follows a humpback whale mother and calf on an epic journey through the shallow seas of our planet. From tropical coral paradises, where the new-born calf takes his first faltering breaths, to the storm-ravaged icy polar seas, the whales' great feeding grounds, we reveal seas of great contrast and surprise.<br /><br />DISC 4<br /><br />SEASONAL FORESTS: From the evergreen forests of the frozen North to the deciduous dry forests of the tropics, these woodlands illustrate the intense seasonality of the Earth. The tallest, largest and oldest organisms on the planet, they are home to a fascinating range of wildlife.<br /><br />OCEAN DEEP: Feast or famine - it's the governing principle of ocean life. From the sailfish, three-meter-long, rapier-billed predators, and the exquisitely shelled Nautilus to the threatened blue whale, this journey into the most unexplored part of the planet reveals the extraordinary survivors of this immense and barren realm.<br /><br />PLANET EARTH - THE FUTURE<br /><br />DISC 5<br /><br />SAVING SPECIES: Many of the animals featured in Planet Earth are endangered so do we face an extinction crisis? Saving Species asks the experts if there really is a problem, looks at the reasons behind the declining numbers of particular animals and questions how we choose which species we want to conserve.<br /><br />INTO THE WILDERNESS: Pollution, climate change and a growing human population are all putting pressure on earth's wildernesses including the Bialowieza forest, the Gobi desert & the Arctic tundra. So how much of the planet is still wilderness? And why should we care?

142312166X|4.0|All right. I will admit that I actually forgot that THE DEMIGOD FILES was coming out in February. I had added it to my wish list some time ago, and since I was in the bookstore today poking around, I was insanely happy and surprised to find it on the shelf. And of course I snatched it up. And then finished reading it a couple hours later. At first, reading the back, and then flipping through I thought that the book was going to contain stuff that I had already read from the previous PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS books, but I was even happier to discover that everything in the book was new: everything from maps, to \\"interviews\\" with the characters, to profiles of main characters, a sneak peek at the last PERCY JACKSON book: THE LAST OLYMPIAN, and the three wonderful short stories about Percy Jackson & Co. that really end up being the highlight of this offering from Rick Riordan.<br /><br />The interviews are somewhat funny and have some interesting little tidbits -- and I'm sure Riordan had a blast working out the different questions to go along with each character interviewed: the Stoll Brothers, Annabeth, Percy, and a couple others. And the map was great to analyze to -- It was interesting to see where Riordan puts things versus the image in my own mind. Also of interest are the full color pages that have sparsely-detailed profiles of the main characters. They're nice looking -- but stuck oddly in the middle of the last of the three shorts, which I'll get to those in a second. There's also a crossword puzzle and a word search, containing facts and tidbits from the books. (The answers to both are just a couple of pages later, so don't feel too frustrated if you can't figure them out.)<br /><br />The three short stories are the definite highlight of this volume, which definitely should be read after THE BATTLE FOR THE LABYRINTH. There are a few small references to events that have happened in all four books that would be missed by a casual reader trying to jump into the middle of the series. The stories include: \\"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot,\\" \\"Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon,\\" and my favorite of the three: \\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades.\\" The stories are brand new adventures in the life of Percy, and they definitely brought back wonderful memories of reading through the first four books. \\"Stolen Chariot\\" is the weakest of the three, an adventure with Percy and Clarisse going after a stolen chariot. The whole thing is exciting, but definitely not up to the par of the other two.<br /><br />\\"Bronze Dragon\\" starts to get things really rolling -- centering on a story with Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin. This is where Riordan pulls out some more of what he does best: presenting small bits of mystery surrounded by action. He even throws in a clever twist near the end that definitely made me smirk. But as good as \\"Bronze Dragon\\" is, it doesn't hold a candle to the amazing short, \\"Sword of Hades.\\" I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. It's the longest of the three, coming in around fifty pages, while the other two average about thirty each. And this story definitely starts to build on the overall story arch of the series, elements of which I'm sure will be included in the final Percy Jackson book. There are plenty of surprises and a few familiar faces that I was so excited to see again. And this one doesn't stop until the last second leaving some very interesting questions left to stew when it's done.<br /><br />Finally, there's a short snippet from the final book, which really doesn't tell us anything except introduce another one of Riordan's signature moves: introduce a story or piece of information without giving us hardly any details, and then interrupting it suddenly with some plot event. But the little tidbit he does show us, makes me wonder what exactly he has up his sleeve for one of the characters... who never quite seemed what they appeared to be on the surface when first introduced.<br /><br />Overall -- this is a great addition to the series for fans, and hopefully it might bring in some new readers. It's definitely worth picking up just for \\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades,\\" but the other selections make for fun reading too.

B000XVT7SW|5.0|I have had this on tape for years, but this new format is much better.Done in surround sound it gives a great presence and of course subtitles are a great help.  In Cavelleria the lip synching is quite good particularly in the case of Cecchele who also acts and sings with great verve.Guelfi's transformation from the benign to the frightenly vengeful Alfio is very convincing.What a phenomenal baritone he possessed.Although mezzos with an extension,and in this case a great one,have essayed Santuzza,I am convinced this is truly a soprano role.However Cossotto copes easily with the role even though it is obvious that the upper register is that of a Mezzo.The minor roles are well done with Adriana Martino as Lola using her sexual attributes to the utmost.  Pagliacci is even better.Peter Glossop is very convincing as the villainous Tonio and his Prologue ranks with the best.I have never liked the voice of Jon Vickers with its strange guttural type sound in the middle,but I accept he was a great tenor, and here, he is a convincing Canio and a frightening one in the final scene.Indeed Raina Kabaivanska looks as if she was actually terrified.She looked beautiful and sang beautifully throughout-her scene with Silvio played by the great Rolando Panerai, being particularly touching.  The sets are very well contrived for both operas and give quite an air of realism.While films can never match the live performance,this DVD would be an ideal introduction for someone anxious to get to know this \\"Ham and Eggs\\" of the operatic world.

But as I thought it over, the more I realized there was some real depth to this story.  Seeing Mr. Moore's suggested origin of Batman's nemesis suggests--at least to me--a reason behind Joker's apparent madness, and that adds the aforementioned depth to this story.  And the last panel certainly doesn't hurt it either.

B001PPLIEG|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace,\\" the latest James Bond film and the second featuring Daniel Craig has its flaws, but is still a pretty spectacular film. The series is in full retooling mode, hardly recognizable when compared to the films of Sean Connery and Roger Moore. While closer to the darker sides of Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan's Bonds, it does have more in common with the popular Jason Bourne series starring Matt Damon, which is not a bad thing.<br /><br />This Bond pickes up right after the end of Casino Royale, as Bond takes a prisoner for interrogation to M, again played by Dame Judy Dench. The interrogation and subsequent events uncovers a global conspiracy named Quantum, with members of prominence and power, including an admired environmentalist who is obviously up to no good. The rest of the film plays out as Bond races to find out and foil the villain's scheme, partnered with a revenge-minded woman, played by Olga Kurylenko.<br /><br />The negatives - This film is much shorter than most Bond films, which isn't good or bad by itself, but the film plays in parts like it had a bit too much cut out, most notably the scenes between Bond and Strawberry Fields, a female agent played by Gemma Arterton. Like many women, she tries to resist Bond's charms to no avail, but as events unfold, it is obvious that Fields and Bond had quite a bit of time together, which is not reflected in the final cut. The villain, played by Mathieu Almaric, does not convey much in the way of danger or menace. He doesn't need to be the kind of kitschy, cartoonish villain that the old Bond films are famous for, but he should at least raise the audiences hackles, but he does not. Finally, the tension between Bond and M is understandable, but every film shouldn't have Bond being stripped of his license and having him act any more of a free agent than he already does. It would be more realistic to show the continued development of their relationship with disagreements and dialogue rather than rely on a plot device that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.<br /><br />The positives, which far outweigh the negatives - Daniel Craig continues to prove that his Bond is like no other. His Bond is nuanced, troubled, and truly, truly dangerous. This Bond seems like someone who has a license to kill and is more apt to use it than any other Bond save Dalton's Bond. His acting talent gives Bond the gravitas and good humor that provides a balanced character. The action scenes have been updated and are breathtaking, and the potential for future films seem limitedless.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace bodes well for the future of the series since even though it is flawed, it is at the same time a very remarkable film.ice that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|Known more for his visual appeal along with intriguing stories, director/writer/producer Darren Aronofsky shows a different, and perhaps better, side of his mastery in storytelling.<br /><br />I first became aware of Aronofsky after seeing his impressive [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream]] back in 2000. Engulfed in that film's unique visual telling, I moved on six years later to see [[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain]]. Extraordinary in just about every way, especially the special effects and how he integrated them into the plot, I then went out and tried to find everything I could by this unique man. What I found was very little. A few minor productions prior to 2000, Aronofsky is an enigma; he's not out there making a movie every eight months like some directors.<br /><br />So when I heard praise being heaped upon THE WRESTLER, it was with great surprise that I found out Aronofsky was both producer and director. I wasn't surprised because it was him, but because the story just didn't sound like something he'd do. I mean, where's the visual appeal in the story of a washed-up pro wrestler? Time for me to eat some crow...<br /><br />The visual appeal isn't there but doesn't need to be. This is a myopic view that focuses its entire lens on that of one man, and does it so powerfully, with such an amazing story, that fans of such things as [[ASIN:B000JSI7DK Rocky]], [[ASIN:B001JQTSG6 Raging Bull]] and [[ASIN:B00004TJQJ Brian's Song]] would be proud to rank it among their favorite sports-related films of all time; it's in my top five.<br /><br />Much of the excitement has been directed at returning film star Mickey Rourke. Returning, you ask? Where had he been? Strangely appropriate, Rourke had taken a hiatus from acting and returned to one of his earlier loves: boxing. From 1991 to 1995, Rourke had become a professional boxer and won a string of matches. But he also received some crushing facial injuries that required reconstructive surgery. These injuries are still noticeable in The Wrestler, but they also give the filming of Rourke's face a unique appeal since we're talking about that of a spiraling down wrestler who's failing body can't keep up.<br /><br />Wearing hearing aids, reading glasses, and having to work at a supermarket in order to make ends meet, Randy `The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is discovering what lay ahead for him, a previously successful wrestler with a fan following that's dying off ...kind of like himself.<br /><br />Beside `The Ram' is a stripper who's also on her downward swing. Getting older and nudged aside by younger, prettier strippers, Cassidy (Marissa Tomei, [[ASIN:B000QFCD86 Wild Hogs]]) spurns The Ram's romantic advances. She still feels like she's got some stripper time left in her, even though the clientele where she works seems to say different. The power with which Tomei pulls her battered, sex-object body around only to learn that she needs something more than a pole to dance around is incredible to watch. But can Cassidy learn that The Ram's love for her is something she needs before it's too late? This is where the crux of the story really pulls the viewer in and holds us to the very, very end.<br /><br />The side story of The Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood, [[ASIN:B000ZLFALS Across the Universe]]) also adds a very human quality to the main character, and gives us more of the in-depth character analysis so many films lack. It also reinforced The Ram's loneliness in a world where aging sports figures learn of their early mistakes, and that trying to make amends often results in old habits cropping up and destroying any such possibilities.<br /><br />Finally, I have to mention the gritty film style that Aronofsky chose for The Wrestler. Hand held camera's and grainy looking film stock all added to a years-gone-by feel that was very appropriate. It also saved a ton of cash. In fact, The Wrestler cost only $7 million to make but has, apparently, made over $70 million as of this writing. The shocking fact for me is not that it's made back ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures. Although this information may not be terribly interesting to movie-goers, I find this extremely admirable considering the multi-gazillion dollar films that get greenlit and then flop at the box office.<br /><br />Aronofsky is the man. And he's got a resume to be proud of, too. And The Wrestler should rank high on his list. It should rank high on yours, too. See it for Rourke's performance. Enjoy it because Aronofsky did a fabulous job.k ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures.

1402756399|5.0|Note: For some reason, the Kindle edition is different from the version I reviewed. The version I reviewed is a hardback and it is not introduced by a creationist. Please be very careful in considering editions of this book, as there are many.    This edition of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" is invaluable to anyone who has been suffering without Darwin's most important work, or getting by with only a stripped-down version. The text is the first edition of the six editions Darwin oversaw in his lifetime.  It's the version scientists now regard as the most powerful and passionate statement of Darwin's views. But besides the full (unabridged) \\"Origin,\\" this large-format book is replete with other materials. The word \\"sumptuous\\" comes to mind. There are hundreds of amazing illustrations, maps and diagrams, many in full color. Also included are scores of substantial excerpts from other works by Darwin and correspondence between him and his contemporaries. This makes the book a treasure to have, because it is so incredibly rich in contextual materials.    For instance, pictures of T.H. Huxley are included along with Huxley's letter to Darwin, where Huxley asserted his (not altogether unconditional) support for Darwin's argument and added that he was sharpening his claws and beak in readiness - that is, to help defend Darwin from his opponents. I was also delighted with the many beautiful photographs taken in the Galapagos Islands and of life forms found there, to say nothing of the pictures of Darwin, his family, colleagues and adversaries that are interspersed throughout the book, and Darwin's own drawings, the pictures of Darwin's home near Downe, his desk, models and a detailed diagram of the H.M.S. Beagle, and so on. There is also a chronology of Darwin's life to 1864. Reading this, you are getting far more than one book: the many excerpts from Darwin's earlier and later writings, and all the illustrations and other materials, provide considerable historical context forthe \\"Origin,\\" its development and reception, making this almost certainly the definitive edition.    If you have never read Darwin's masterpiece, this book is a first-class reason to do so. His prose is elegant - even, at times, eloquent. The argument unfolds logically and clearly.  Darwin was an utterly unpretentious English gentleman, after all, who lived during the Victorian era; he was, and remains, a highly agreeable companion.  (If you enjoy travel literature, Darwin's earlier \\"Voyage of the Beagle\\" is also highly readable and fascinating. It sold well in his lifetime and reads almost like an adventure story. Many excerpts from \\"Voyage\\" appear in the book under review. They may tempt you to read the other book - \\"Voyage of the Beagle,\\" that is.) \\"On the Origin of Species\\" was written to be read by anyone - it is not merely for scientists or experts.  Small wonder that the first edition sold out the same day it was released.    One of the most striking things about the \\"Origin\\" is how careful, even cautious, Darwin is in drawing inferences from the piles of data he had before him. (In fact, he devoted an entire chapter to describing potential objections to his own arguments. That takes candor to a very high level. Yet creationists often just read that chapter in order to find objections to evolution, as if Darwin had not already thought the matter through, and as if modern science had not already resolved those objections, since Darwin so thoughtfully and disarmingly enumerated them.) Darwin's argument thus has more force than it would if he made claims that the data did not so clearly support. Darwin's great virtue as a scientist is that he did not let his own beliefs prejudice his investigations: he let the evidence speak plainly for itself. He was humble, painstaking and forthright.    Since I originally prepared this review, another superb edition of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" has been published by Harvard's Belknap Press, which provides excellent and substantial annotations to a facsimile of the original 1859 text, on the same pages as the text itself. That is a handsome volume which is immensely helpful because the annotations (prepared by James T. Costa, a biologist himself) explain so much. Darwin's writing is precise and clear but lay readers often have questions - or would, if we knew what to ask - that are answered in the annotations.  Professor Costa updates much of what is being said in the text with current scientific knowledge, explains why Darwin is saying what he is saying, and generally offers valuable insights. The result is to make Darwin's book even more accessible to the general reader.  Regrettably, that volume does not have all the rich contextual materials, illustrations and selections from other works that distinguish the edition under review here. Still, if your objective is to read Darwin's seminal work and comprehend it, Costa's is doubtless as good a book as there is. Thus, while it would be ideal if both of these books could be combined, we should be vastly grateful that two such outstanding editions of this important work became available at reasonable cost during the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"  You can take your pick, or if you really love Darwin and science, get both (as I did).    While I recommend reading \\"On the Origin of Species\\" in any edition, this is a lavish and eminently worthwhile volume, which I have added to the several editions I already own.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|For a band whose genius rests largely in their minimalist approach, a lot's actually happened to AC/DC since the last time they released any new material to the masses with 2000's Stiff Upper Lip: A spot in the otherwise dubious Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, guest appearances with the Stones (the only other band to give any challenge to AC/DC as the world's greatest -- and long-tenured -- rock and roll band), the Live at Donnington and No Bull concert videos, a very exhaustive look through the band's video past in the Plug It In and Family Jewels DVD sets, and, most importantly for this long-time fan, the re-issuing of its entire catalog of CDs, which blessedly and finally added the appropriate low-end muscle to 25-plus years of the blues set to head-banging riffs and monster power chords, mixed with a plodding yet steady rhythm section, all behind the mischievous growls and whiskey-gargled vocals of not one, but two separate vocalists. Throw in their recent ringing endorsement of John McCain (added commentary from your truly) and you get the stuff of which the living legends assuredly deserve.    All this leads up to Black Ice, AC/DC's latest album, due out next week via the band's website and an exclusive deal with Wal-Mart. Naturally, conventional wisdom would lead anyone with even a passing knowledge or interest in the band to think, \\"OK, another album of the same ol'-same ol': Braggadocio-laden single entendre songs about chicks, cars and more chicks, screaming nods to the devil scattered amongst the pounding drums and squealing guitars.\\" Well, yes and no.    Since after all this is AC/DC, and now over 30 years into their careers, the brothers Young and Brian Johnson aren't going to get too far reinventing their respective unicycles. Drummer Phil Rudd, the Beavis and Butthead poster child for cool, isn't going to alter his bam-thwok chug-along approach too much either, and I also get the feeling bassist Cliff Williams will never get as cool a lick to play as theone on Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap's \\"Squealer.\\"    However, the mass releases of their video and audio vaults do actually seem to have given the band an opportunity to not necessarily completely abandon the dance that brung 'em, but at minimum explore a few never-before-scratched itches, something in which producer Brendan O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots) gladly indulges the band.    Using an organic, live-in-the-studio approach similar to what makes studio wunderkind Rick Rubin's projects, from Neil Diamond to Metallica this year alone, so successful, O'Brien lets AC/DC do what it's done so well for so long to start Black Ice, kicking off with \\"Rock 'N Roll Train\\" barreling along as dependably as \\"Money Talks,\\" \\"Who Made Who\\" and \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" have for years. \\"Skies on Fire\\" follows in similar fashion, leading into \\"Big Jack.\\" While seemingly no relation to \\"The Jack,\\" an AC/DC concert staple going back to the 70s, I have more than a sneaking suspicion O'Brien knew exactly what he was doing in his guiding the band forward by hearkening to their storied past.    Original lead man Bon Scott, diminutive though he was, continued to cast a large shadow over the rest of AC/DC's history after his death in 1980, something from around which Brian Johnson could never quite fully get. Granted, he carved his own niche with his piercing wail as opposed to Scott's predatory growl, but Johnson rarely sounded completely comfortable filling the shoes. Not to say there haven't been several great moments from the Johnson era, but a gleeful menace was missing from even the best AC/DC songs of the last 20-some years, a fact the sonically boosted re-issues made all too apparent.    No longer, and we have \\"Anything Goes,\\" Black Ice's track four to thank for that. Backed by Angus and Malcolm's guitars that sound like fiddles from hell, and a rollicking swing that equally recalls Slade and -- irony of ironies considering they were the finest of the AC/DC clones -- Cinderella,Johnson giddily bounces and prowls through a tale of the many joys of the living the rock and roll life, the yin to the yang of \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock and Roll).\\"    The band senses it on the subsequent songs, too, especially \\"War Machine.\\" What could have been a paint-by-tablature retread of bombast and guns, the song motors and careens with energy to spare, the chorus vigorously answering Johnson's call-to-arms with just those two simple words. Like I mentioned earlier, minimalist genius and not bad at all for guys whose gusto shames their slightly older contemporaries Aerosmith. Blame or thank that challenge on track seven, \\"Spoilin' for a Fight,\\" now gracing my headphones.    However, it's not the high-octane songs on Black Ice -- easily AC/DC's most consistently listenable album since The Razor's Edge and undoubtedly their best front-to-back collection since Back in Black -- that leave the most lasting impressions. Those instead belong to \\"Stormy May Day\\" and \\"Rock 'N Roll Dream.\\" The former allows Angus Young -- whose solos through the years, notably his intro to \\"Thunderstruck,\\" cement his fingers as some of the fastest and fleetest in the business -- the opportunity to showcase his previously unknown skills with a slide guitar, slowing the groove and well befitting a man who's consistently claimed from its inception that AC/DC isn't heavy metal and are rather a slightly loud blues band. The same theory applies to \\"Rock 'N Roll Dream,\\" wherein Brian Johnson finally gets his \\"Ride On.\\" As the band turns the volume down ever-so-slightly, Johnson gently yet convincingly dances on lyrics that portray a man who knows damn well how lucky he is to have the life he does.    In a perfect world, these two songs would close the shows on the band's soon-to-kickoff world tour, but I know that's not happening. Even I can admit that some things, especially AC/DC ending concerts with the cannons of \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You),\\" need to remain pretty much the same ... and God bless 'em for it. Fire!!!    [...]
0553278223|4.0|Mars fascinates us. We've probed and photographed our neighbor for years but never managed to visit in person. Our pulp prophets have launched thousands upon thousands of occupying armadas from its orbit, their commanders green-skinned and tentacled and wanting to be taken to our leaders. Ray Bradbury, though, gently subverts fact and expectation in The Martian Chronicles, with humanity becoming both explorers and invaders of the Red Planet.    Chronicles binds 26 of shorts and short shorts -- most original to the collection, some not -- into an overarching narrative about man's arrival on, settlement in and abandonment of Mars. The initial stories weave horror into the blend, the planet's telepathic inhabitants considering the earthlings to be romantic rivals (\\"Ylla\\"), insane (\\"The Earth Men\\") and, finally, marauders (\\"The Third Expedition\\"), with fatal results. Only after disease runs rampant among the inhabitants does man begin to colonize, ushering in a looser middle section. \\"The Green Morning\\" re-imagines the myth of Johnny Appleseed. \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\" tackles race relations. A lonely couple mourning the loss of a child finds unexpected comfort in \\"The Martian.\\" But colonies can't survive without support from the motherland, a theme the final stories tighten around. With war raging back home, a business owner gets ensnared by bitter irony (\\"The Off Season\\"), a frustrated Romeo learns that there are worse fates than loneliness (\\"The Silent Towns\\") and a widowed inventor faces \\"The Long Years\\" with the family he fashioned for himself.    Despite Bradbury's mastery of the short story, Chronicles never quite comes together. His infatuation with middle America (\\"Rocket Summer,\\" \\"Interim\\"), emphasis on the evils of censorship (\\"Usher II\\") and embracing of facile humanism (\\"The Million-Year Picnic\\") appear anachronistic when viewed from Mars' desert wastes. Also, continuity isn't his strong point; the capabilities, culture and even appearance of the Martians varies from piece to piece. But when read individually, the stories still have the power to steal both your breath and imagination. Chronicles' threads are stronger than their frayed sum.

B000B9J4EI|4.0|Works created with the intent of bending genres can prove instructive, if not uniformly entertaining. Some never manage to overcome inherent tensions and break apart. Others end up squiggly and shapeless, more exercises in frustration than anything else. Still others try to twist together wildly divergent ideas, the pieces never quite meeting no matter how hard the author tries. Then there are narratives -- rare and wonderful ones -- that shift from element to element so easily you wonder why no one has tried their particular combination before. Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is one of these.<br /><br />Robert Neville is the sole survivor of a plague that killed his wife and daughter, the inhabitants of the city where he lives, and (as far as he knows) the world's entire population. By day he scavenges, digging up necessities such as food and water and wooden dowelling. Mirrors, too, if he can get them, and garlic. Because while might be the last man alive, he is not the last man on earth. When darkness falls, the plague's victims come out, transformed into viscous, blood-drinking vampires by ... By what, exactly? Neville doesn't know, but he'll do everything in his power to find out.<br /><br />Post-apocalyptic, horror, hard SF and myth -- there's genre divergence if ever you saw it. But Matheson twines them into a single story with a contortionist's grace, leveraging commonalities to make the styles meet. Anyone who has experienced a catastrophe of some kind knows that such things hold hands with horror. And melding science and superstition isn't too much of a stretch, either. Indeed, Matheson's naturalistic re-imagining of vampirism is one of the novel's high points. The same can't be said for its dour ending. While downbeat conclusions are fine and good in their place, the close of Neville's struggles strips them of significance through no fault of his own. A disappointing turn on an otherwise excellent piece.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I Love this show & received the DVD on Christmas. I have watched it so many times my boyfriend (who bought it for me) cannot believe that I haven't gotten sick of it yet. Sheldon has got to be the funniest character ever, not to take anything away from the rest of the cast who totally make the show come together. It's just great entertainment & ALWAYS funny, no bad episodes. I can't wait for Season 2 to come out so I can give 1 a rest.
0767817478|1.0|I used to like Emmerich's version of \\"Godzilla\\" when I was a kid. But now, I see the film as a big disappointment. This one is an insult to the original Japanese Godzilla. The big lizard itself is a joke. It's vulnerable, it's not intelligent, and it's . . . PREGNANT??? Who the hell thought of THAT?! It's almost as dumb as turning King Kong into a f***ing ephebophile! And I hope THAT doesn't happen, either!<br /><br />What makes this film worse is the waste of good actors. While Jean Reno plays his part well, Broderick, Azaria, Pitillo and Shearer look like cardboard cut-outs. Their performances aren't three-dimensional, and they're not completely believable. But the parody of Siskel and Ebert was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />What makes this film even worse is that its Americanization of Godzilla just doesn't work. Yes, I love this country very much, but the Japanese originals are far superior to this worthless remake. And even if it is a guy in a suit, it still looks realistic compared to the CGI creation. And this movie as a whole is not very entertaining. If I ever saw this film again, I would cringe while looking at the sad attempt of reimagining the big guy.<br /><br />Aside from the monstrously entertaining \\"Independence Day,\\" this is definitely Emmerich and Devlin's weakest film ever.
141690977X|4.0|By chance I saw the authors of this book on Oprah a a few years ago (2006, I think) when this book first came out.  Greg's personality was captivating.  He was so blunt and funny that he caught my attention.  Also, I am one of those women who never got any \\"dating\\" advice from anyone, so I went through many of the \\"types\\" and situations mentioned in the book.  Today, out of curiosity, I picked up the book in Target and stood there for over an hour laughing, relating and thinking, \\"I wish someone had told me all of this stuff 35 years ago.\\"  Now, if you are a woman who is already savvy to the possible bad behaviors of certain men, then you will probably think this book is silly.  But if you are one of the types of women that these sorts of men \\"prey\\" on -- I think they can sense us -- then you will be glad to have this book spell it out to you like you were a six year old.  This book certainly does not present all the possibilities of how relationships work, but the situations it does cover are very real for some woman, and it's useful to have a straight forward, down-to-earth, easy-to-read, humorous book tell you that YOU are more important than any man, and you are wasting your time putting up with bad behavior, expecting it to change.  Like I said, not every woman may need to hear this message, but if you do, this is an entertaining way to hear it.
074325144X|2.0|I am a running coach and had heard all the hype about this book so I felt compelled to buy it. At the end of the day, the information was not nearly as useful or revolutionary as the hype suggests. What it is, is merely a copy cat of \\"Pose running\\" with Ti-Chi attached.  Now I don't have a problem with Ti-Chi, I just think it was the \\"juice\\" to sensationalize a system of running that is already in play. Well written, not much to argue with, I just was hoping for a bit more unique factor from the author which I did not find.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I can say that you'll burn calories, but Jillian's style was a big turn off.  I've taught Aerobics, and love working out to DVD's, but I wouldn't recommend this DVD to a beginner or expert.  Not worth the time or the money.

1844137872|5.0|I'm a huge Banksy fan, and this was a great book to see his past work.  The wry wit was so enjoyable, and it's a great coffee table book.  There is some adult humour, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are offended by such things.
0061124265|3.0|it is rare for me to read a book continuously through without having to put it down for some time and then return to it. i had to put this one down for a week or two and then pick it up again. i did finish it, so i did enjoy it. it was a bit strange reading, but my opinion is if i care enough to finish it then it's enjoyable. not life changing, but enough to interest me in finishing it.
1878424505|5.0|If your looking to change your life, whether it be a whole life overhaul or just a better outlook, than this is the book that you MUST read.     I have re-read this book well over a dozen times and each time I read it I get more out of it. The four agreements changed how I perceive life and the people around me. The first agreement is extremely potent and also very hard to follow. Gossip is a poison that can destroy a persons self-esteem and sense of worth.      The second agreement to me is the most important. I used to take everything personally! Everything that people said or did I believed was directly connected to me! How egotistical! The truths in this book with jump off the page at you if you are ready to receive it.      I recommended this book to my father and he read it quickly and dismissed it as \\"junk\\". Two years later he re-read it and the profound truths spoke to him in way that he had not previously been prepared for. We have had many discussions about this book and im so glad he found the value of it. Heaven can exsist on earth, we just need to know how to find it. Go ahead and look for yourself, you might be pleasently surprised :)
0316017922|2.0|I was disappointed with this book and considering stopping a few pages into it and returning the darn thing.    Mr. Gladwell has, in all his books, a great fluency. This book reads well. He tells his stories. For a while, you think learning Deep Truths as if you were reading Plato.    But you're not. You're reading a meandering research paper. What do the communication issues in flying a commercial jet have to do with success in life overall? Pretty much nothing. But \\"pilot error\\" accidents are a chapter in the book.    A good many people will read a book on success to improve themselves or to be inspired by others' success. Like the one about Bill Gates being one of the top fifty programmers in the world as high school kid because of his privileged high school education, every anecdote is interesting, but no anecdote will make you one iota closer to being Mr. Gates or remotely like him. Unless of course, you yourself are one of top computer programmers already.    Gladwell's generational stories here ring both true and false. People in my own family are in losing generations according to Mr. Gladwell, but they aren't losers. Maybe that's another book for the author.     Overall, the book views success as oddly predetermined. No one reading this book -- unless he's cruising smugly on his yacht -- can find any of this too cheery.  It could readily be used to defend Britain's class system because it mantra is the best-bred families accomplish the most.    But the suthor's tone is so light, you think you reading UPLIFTING good news. But you're not.    Moreover, the book is filled with stereotypes: the Jewish immigrant's children all become eminent doctors or lawyers; Asians are always good at math, etc. Isn't a positive sterotype still offensive?    Overall, this is a seductive, distressing and shallow mishmash. It is sad to think it has been a best seller in our country.

B001HN6972|5.0|Rarely does a film like The Reader come along.  The film is dramatic and passionate, perverse and beautiful, thought-provoking and emotional all at the same time.  At times, the film leaves you confused, upset, angry, sad, happy.  It is about the most human thing I've seen on the big screen.<br /><br />Films with Holocaust themes have tended to depict the event and its actors in dichotomies of good and evil.  This film blurs those lines and makes you question assumptions you will invariably make as the plot of the film unfolds.  The actors transport you to a time and place that is different from our own, yet eerily familiar at the same time.<br /><br />The acting is what really made this film.  Transferring the emotions of everyday life to the big screen takes real talent, especially when those feelings are as traumatic and deep as those of love and betrayal.  In this film, the cast took the acting to a whole new level.<br /><br />The film is aided by a fantastic story line.  The twists and turns come at you from every direction.  The story will set-up certain assumptions in your mind only to knock them down an hour later.<br /><br />The Reader is not for everyone.  Hannah's role in the the Holocaust will understandably disturb some viewers.  The film contains many depictions of sexual activities that would not be appropriate for younger audiences.  For the mature viewer who is looking for something fresh and thought-provoking, however, The Reader is one film not to miss.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|This film has been unjustly neglected by the various film societies which deliver awards for excellence, with the exception of the National Board of Review. Its relatively unheralded excellence lies not solely in its lead performance and direction, though Clint Eastwood is outstanding on both counts. What is most wonderful is the remarkably witty and insightful script he's been given to work with, a script by a first-time screenwriter. Its thesis, subversive for our age of political correctness and speech codes to protect shrinking violets from being \\"offended,\\" is that, when push come to shove, actions, as the old proverb has always told us, speak louder than mere words. Yet we live in an age obsessed by words, one frequently oblivious to deeds, an age in which Clarence Thomas, for instance, was pilloried for making a merely verbal pass without punitive consequences, while a presumably verbally decorous President was given a free pass for flagrantly outrageous deeds with an intern. Go figure! This film's script is daring enough to get the relation between merely \\"offensive\\" words and surprisingly noble deeds back into proper proportion. As a corrective to a contemporary imbalance in vision, it deserves far more praise than it's so far received.
B000022TSY|5.0|I was 17, living in East Texas (about 50 miles from Louisiana) when Easy Rider came out. The South was an angry place during 1967-1971. That anger was mostly used to strike at the different and extreme... the different and extreme according to low to mid class whites. The movie reveals a great friendship between two, then three, traveling partners. Their friendship wasn't any different or perverse than those of people in the states through which they traveled. However, the prejudice that lived among the angry, older generation of the southern states proved to be unaccepting, even violent.  Though made with little money, the way it's shot, and the characters it produces makes Easy Rider a great classic movie.  I recommend you buy it.  If you don't understand it the first time, watch it again.  You will come to agree.
1591841666|3.0|The Dip is an easily digestible self-help book comprised of 80 pages in short form with a simple message. Godin implores the reader to quit when appropriate, brave it when the circumstance demands it and to recognize the dip, which is a trough or low-point that may or not be the catalyst for success.<br /><br />According to Godin one can face three situations. These are characterized as curves and are:<br /><br />-The Dip: the period or stretch between kicking off a job, a project or the work required between the beginning and fruition. The author advises one that quitting ahead of time - i.e. not starting - is necessary if one is not going to be the best at something. Godin, however, values the best greatly and emphasizes that the super stars are number one because they recognize the right potential and slog in-between. These types fight through and come out winners at the other end of the dip.<br />-The Cul-de-Sac (dead-end): is a job, process or plan that simply put is going nowhere. The author wants you to quit and to insist your friends quit too when in a cul-de-sac. Don't wait, he insists, quit now and save your time and life.<br />-The Cliff: is the rarer case where there is a deep and dangerous plunge at its tail-end. Godin's example is smoking and the consequent emphysema. There is a sharp drop at the end of The Cliff.<br /><br />The Dip is slightly better than the average 'advice' or 'help' book. Compared to malicious stuff like QBQ that tells employees to become modern corporate serfs Godin does have a point. It encourages people to be realistic and quit when necessary with pride and courage or persist and work through given good potential. He does prescribe quitting ahead and not avoiding pain as well when the dip is not right.<br /><br />Having said that, it is not quite clear how one would identify a dip versus a Cul-de-Sac. While he invites one to ask himself whether measurable progress is being made that in itself is hardly simple or self-explanatory. The metrics are missing of course. It is too bad, but at least the author does insist that suffering in silence or feeling like failures when quitting are not virtues. Coping is actually a culprit.is too bad, but at least the author does insist that suffering in silence or feeling like failures when quitting are not virtues. Coping is actually a culprit.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As written in my blog: [...]    I recently saw the HBO production of \\"John Adams\\". This epic of a rental engaged me with both education and entertainment through exploding sensory images and sounds, and poignant characterizations.    As was the expectation, I found the movie series' display of Revolutionary life to be fascinating, offering viewers a glimpse into everyday life situations. After all, many in our generation would never stop to realize that an outdoor well's faucet may freeze over during winter months, thus rendering people waterless. Women today who suffer from Breast Cancer cannot imagine what could be worse than the stale, cold procedures they currently must endure. In fact, what could be worse is having your breast excised from your body without any anesthesia, such was purportedly done to Adam's daughter.     I consider myself relatively learned on Adam's life, though by no means a scholar. I've read multiple historical biographies of Adams' peers, including those of Hamilton, Jefferson and Washington, which has by default educated me on President Adams. I found the HBO production quite parallel with almost all that I know of Adams, however I always imagined the rivalry between Adams and Jefferson to be much more fierce than displayed in the mini-series (so as to warrant Adams' famed final words \\"Jefferson survives.\\")    Giamatti and Linney's performances were stellar so that by the film's end I could envision nobody else portraying either character. Giamatti's version of Adams to me, gently illustrated Adams' quirks and tendencies toward perfection. Although Adams' high-strung personality was adequately displayed, the character was more than human and very identifiable.    Linney's performance required her to play Abigail in a very reserved fashion, which was brilliantly executed. Although I suspect that Mrs. Adams was as forthright as was portrayed, Linney's performance required her to adapt the character somewhat so that modern audiences would respect her.
B00003W8NM|1.0|Dear people,     Do you do things as part of your job that are probably wrong? Do you feel powerless, controled by 'the man'?     Well forget about solving your problems, why not just beat other people up who are in similar plights? As a hobby!!     When this movie became a cult classic, every old railroad tyrant from the gilded age probably rolled over in there grave and said \\"Dang! Why didn't I think of that?\\"    And of course, after the making of this movie, some people even started thier own little imitation fight clubs. Talk about dumbing us down.     And it was supposedly disturbing to some people how the tower explosion scene resembled 9-11. Well of course. That's the real outcome of a sadist fantasy.
B0018AVNKC|5.0|Coraline Jones (Fanning) and her family have just moved to an old mansion in the middle of nowhere.  Her mother (Hatcher) and father (Hodgman) are writers with little time for her, so she spends her days exploring.  She meets a lot of strange people that living in the area, including the next-door neighbor, Wybie Lovat (Bailey) and his cat; two sisters (Saunders and French); and the \\"circus man,\\" Mr. Bobinsky (McShane).  But, the most interesting thing that she finds is a hidden door that appears to lead nowhere, until one night it leads her through a portal to her \\"Other Mother\\" and \\"Other Father\\".  They only want to make her happy, but things may be too good to be true.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is the first stop-motion animated film made in 3-D, and it looks spectacular.  It looks almost computer animated, but with rich textures that computer animation doesn't provide.  The animation is incredibly smooth, and everything looks amazing.  Director Selick is known for his work with stop-motion animation, and has taken things to the next level here.  The voice talents all do wonderful jobs bringing their characters to life.  The story is for all ages and not predictable.  I highly recommend \\"Coraline\\" for both children and adults, but be sure to see it in 3-D.

B001GCUNVW|5.0|Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Rourke) is a past-his-prime professional wrestler who is now performing in small venues and doing signings for a living.  He still thinks he can regain the glory of 20 years ago, but a heart attack tells him differently.  His doctor tells him give up wrestling or die.  He does not know any other way of life, but gets a job at a deli counter to make some extra money.  He also attempts to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Wood) and start a relationship with a stripper (Tomei) with whom he is friends.  Her life parallels his, as she is past her prime in the stripping business, and maybe that is enough of a connection for them to start something.<br /><br />\\"The Wrestler\\" is a great comeback for Rourke, and a great acting showcase for both him and Tomei.  They both bare theor souls in their troubled characters.  The movie's inside look into the world of wrestling is fascinating, especially the behind-the-scenes stuff.  Director Darren Aronofsky uses a minimalist approach to filming, and that suits the story well.  This is a solid film filled with great performances.  I highly recommend it.

B001GSV3EC|4.0|I love Jeff Beck's guitar playing and have come to expect superb output, but this collection of live stuff, Performing This Week...Live At Ronnie Scotts (2008), just does not have the kick that I expected.  The songs for the most part seem a bit uninspired, though there are some classic moments which make the album on a whole worth the effort of listening to.  Also, I agree with one of the comments that there seems to be a lack of bass throughout, and for that matter, the drums and keyboards also seem to be mixed down (for the most part) -- that's too bad, as more oomph in those areas could have aided the overall sound production quite a bit.
B000058983|5.0|re: love - forever changes    after all these years (40!)love's \\"forever changes\\" is still relevent lyrically. their music is truly representative of the l.a. scene back in the day... looking past the material concerns of a previous generation and speaking to the brotherhood of man. and those mariachi horns and the flaminco guitar stylings... definitely provided the ethnic appeal that set Love apart from other great bands playing our multicultural city in the mid to late sixties. and there were many great bands to be heard, indeed.
0439023483|4.0|The book is really great once it gets started.  It is no doubt a teen book, but it is very fun and adventurous.  Lots of suspense and great characters.

B001DEVZUG|4.0|The reason I didnt give this a perfect score is because the dvd is missing the two new videos..Pattern Of My Life & Shinning Light! They should have included these! If nothing else if they didnt have them ready by the time this went to press they could have released the cd now and the dvd later.  and included ALL of her solo videos! The videos are also missing \\"Lovesong For A Vampire\\".  Also they didnt include a play all feature..it returns to the menu after each video plays..the picture quality on Cold is poor too.  Other than the tacky work on the dvd the CD is EXCELLENT! Except the songs are the album versions and not the singles versions. Which isnt bad but if you preferred the single versions you'll be getting the original album versions of these great hits! Wish we would have gotten the three disc set like the UK will be getting but you can download it on Itunes.  It includes \\"Everybody Hurts\\" REM cover featuring Alica Keys! Also includes \\"Into The West\\" so check it out too on Itunes.  The package is cute ...I like the booklet.  Overall its good but I feel they could have made it a more complete collection for the US fans.  Like they are doing in the UK by adding the two new videos and a second cd of rare songs.  Annie is and will always be my favorite diva it is a shame of how poorly they promote her in the states.
B001JQVKBW|1.0|I really like Seal - \\"Human Being\\" was an amazing album that I listen to all the time - but I must say, Soul disappoints.  All the numbers are slickly produced, downtempo, modern, but they lack... well, soul.  Seal brings his gentle, crooning voice to all of them, but not much passion.  It's like an old guy, fondly remembering the songs he grew up on.  Nice, I guess, if you like that sort of thing, but kind of boring really.      If you like this recording, go find the original versions of these numbers.  You will be blown away by the energy, originality and sheer greatness of singers like Wilson Pickett and Curtis Mayfield.    They also capture the spirit of a time that is, for better or worse, long gone - which may be part of the problem.  Curtis Mayfield was looking forward.  Seal is looking back.    He seems like he's lost here, and searching for something.  I hope he finds it because he can be a great singer when he hits his groove.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|But, I suppose I can be manipulated nearly as easily as Cristina since I've seen several of them at the urgings of others.  Can't use that out this time though, I decided this year I wanted to see every Oscar nominated performance in major categories so Penelope, it's your fault. Plus, due to the cinematography, I'm probably going to have the fork over some cash for a vacation in Barcelona with my visually inspired wife.<br /><br />So, essentially this is a film about two women, one in search of the utopia of relationships and the other well along - and quite willingly - the path to upper middle class angst and regret, who decide to spend the summer exploring the flora, fauna and architecture of Barcelona. Lo and behold, in short order each is sweet talked out of their [....] by the dulcet intonations of an unapologetic womanizing artist.  Add to the mix equal proportions of obsession and opprobrium between the womanizer and his passionate, high strung (read borderline psychotic) ex-wife who somehow manage to cultivate a symbiotic connection with the flaxen haired bohemian and what you end up with is a putatively subtle yet ultimately unremarkable Woody Allen comedy.<br /><br />Maybe there's a trenchant message that I can't understand but more than anything, it seemed like an fall session report of what the pretentious did on their summer vacation.

B001HN6972|3.0|I've read the book and I feel that the film could have been a lot better. It should have been in German, to begin with. The essence of the story was lost once the characters spoke in English. Otherwise, the Reader would have been one of the more notable movies this year. Kate Winslet delivers another powerhouse performance. She's due an Oscar after losing out on Little Children last year. So I won't be surprised if she wins it. There were many great films last year. This could have been one of them.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was obviously a fan of the movie (and books!) and so that is why I originally purchased the CD.  The CD and all of the songs on it are terrific.<br /><br />Also, I found myself liking the different bands on the CD as well which I probably would not have listened to before having seen the movie.  I  have now purchased other music CD's these artists have made as well.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Danny Boyle has done it again. Another superbly directed movie. It goes to show that you don't need big name actors or Hollywood sfx to make a great film. In fact, great is an understatement. Its a brilliant film!  I won't be surprised if he goes on to win Best Director at this year's Oscars. I highly recommend Millions, also directed by Boyle, if you enjoyed this one.

B001GQSY64|5.0|This is a movie anyone from any age can enjoy. I have always loved Star Wars and now this is the very first one to come out on Blu-Ray. This movie has lots of action, lots of humor, and one a lot of people can relate to. I was a kid when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace came out and I really loved it, and I of course am a fan of the classics as well, I really liked it that Anakin gets a padawan because I personally liked it how he used to be a kid who looks up to Qui-gon and Obi-Wan and now he has a kid who looks up to him as a master, I thought that was cool. The tv show rocks too, it is almost like each and every episode is an intire movie itself, if the series comes out on Blu-Ray I totally recomend any one to get them.
B001KO3FFW|5.0|Upon first look, David Cook's debut album is reading out of the modern rock playbook, but even with this unoriginality, it has it's formula down solid, creating a pleasant and radio-friendly atmosphere for fans and top 40 followers alike. Standout tracks include \\"Decoration,\\" \\"Bar-Ba-Sol,\\" \\"Lie,\\" \\"Permanent,\\" \\"A Daily Anthem,\\" and the possible highlight, \\"Avalanche.\\" David is perfectly suited for the genre, and pulls it off seamlessly. And vocally, on \\"Permanent\\" he brings the house down... I mean, the guy won AI for a reason.<br /><br />In fact, I couldn't really point to a bad song on the album. From start to finish, David Cook's self-titled debut is a great listen, and I'm not saying that because I'm a fan of the guy, because I could see any number of songs off this album becoming big hits on the radio. He even blows Daughtry out of the water in overall album quality. It's perfect for stuffing your iPod with, and you'll be pleased with what you hear.

B000TEUCFA|5.0|Stacey Kent and Jim Tomlinson's latest collaboration, \\"Breakfast on the Morning Tram\\" is a delightful departure from the dozen or so previous albums they have recorded together.  Several original tunes penned by Jim and Kazuo Ishiguro highlight the session.  This is warm, sophisticated, vocal and instrumental jazz at it's best. We recently traveled to Salt Lake to catch Stacey and Jim in one of their rare North American gigs.  They were on their way to Hollywood for the Grammy awards as the album had been nominated for \\"Best Jazz Vocal of the Year; and well deserved I might add. I could go on and on about my love for the music of these two, but suffice it to say that this is a don't miss experience.

When the LAPD in the person of Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) tell her they've found him, she's ecstatic.  However, the boy who steps off the train (Devon Conti) is not her son.  And the police won't believe her.<br /><br />Christine's only ally in trying to get the truth out is the Reverend Brieglab (John Malkovich) who has a local radio program.  Will that be enough to get the corrupt police to do something?  And what has happened to Walter?<br /><br />And yet I almost didn't see this film because it wasn't my normal comedy.  I'm glad I allowed myself to be talked into it.  It was wonderful for a change of pace.<br /><br />Between the mystery of what happened to Walter and the injustices that Christine faces, this is a riveting movie.  I was glued to the screen the entire running time and still can't believe it is over two hours.<br /><br />The film looked like old film noir pieces with lots of muted colors.  The exception to that rule was Christine's lipstick, which is almost always bright red.  Clint Eastwood did as great a job with the music as he did the directing.  His compositions fit the film beautifully.<br /><br />I must give special praise to Devon Conti who gave his performance as the fake Walter a slightly creepy edge that fit the movie perfectly.  Angelina Jolie was great as our lead, except in her more emotional scenes.  Crying while trying not to cry just didn't work for me.<br /><br />My only other complaint was some timeline issues at the end, but I can't say too much more without spoiling anything.<br /><br />Adults looking for a moving drama will enjoy this film.
B0014LTFGO|1.0|I'm really upset, actually. I ordered four books and received one. I was lied to in the advertisement and only received one book when I was expecting four. They were a Christmas present, too. This is not the first time this has happened to me with Amazon. I'm actually still waiting for a book I ordered over a month ago and that I have been charged for. I'm not using Amazon again.

I was also happy that it had the song Anything Goes on here (it wasn't in the track listing).  I'm listening to it right now.  Thank you for re-issuing the original soundtracks.
6304602901|2.0|This is a rarity among comedies in that it actually ages quite well and the jokes are still pretty amusing albeit not perhaps as side-splittingly funny as when you first heard them but then again that's the way with most jokes anyway.  I particularly liked Harris' horse scene the best although there are \\"many, many\\" (ahem!)good scenes throughout the film.  If you like your comedies ala \\"Animal House\\" or \\"Caddyshack\\" style, you'll still love this good comedy.<br /><br />The only problem though is with this dvd version which comes in mono sound quality and picture quality that's not the best that I've ever seen plus no special features worth mentioning.  I would like to see a Director's Cut version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options and a vastly improved restored picture quality version with decent Special Features with anamorphic widescreen features released on either the Blu-ray or standard dvd format soon.  I thought \\"Airplane\\" also aged pretty well but in my opinion, \\"Police Academy\\" has aged better as a comedy over the years.<br /><br />Recommended and still good for a laugh.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|this cd was in excellent condition when I received it. the cd only had two small smudges on it, but they easily came off.
6304712936|5.0|This is not the Director's Cut version and hence clocks in at \\"only\\" 160 minutes but I found myself enjoying the film so much that I didn't really feel the time.  I'm a big fan of all kinds of music and Classical music is among my favourite genres and although Handel, Bach, Vivaldi and Beethoven hold greater esteem for me than does Mozart, I'm still able to appreciate his genius and so a film like this is a real treat.  Irrespective of whether or not Salieri really was behind Mozart's death in real life as it is depicted here in reel life you have to admit that this is a very good film that shows how much hypocrisy and envy can conspire to destroy the truly beautiful in life.<br /><br />The problem with this one-disc dvd version though is the picture quality which hasn't been restored and so you get imperfections such as black and white spots on many frames and the resolution isn't as sharp as I would like it to be.  The sound quality, however, is very good having been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and is the aspect of this dvd that I enjoyed the most.  There are no Special Features here worth mentioning such as interviews with cast and crew or making-of documentaries either.<br /><br />If you are not too fussed about picture quality and/or special features though, this one-disc dvd version is a bare bones non-Director's version of a very good film for classical music lovers.  Believe me when it comes to this genre, very few performers can top Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and you get them here on Dolby Digital Surround sound too!<br /><br />As for me, I'll \\"upgrade\\" to the Blu-ray version of this film as soon as I come around to getting a Blu-ray player.  Hopefully, the picture quality has been restored well in that version.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to do this here: the digibook director's cut blu-ray of this film is now the definitely version.  This together with [[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray]]] are now the best blu-ray releases that I've seen and I wish all blu-ray re-releases are made this way.  Firstly, most of us already have vhs or dvd versions of our favourite films and so what should the studios do the entice us to double-dip?  Putting the film on blu-ray and in a digibook format certainly helps and here we also get not only the best version of the film on one disc plus improved special features but also a very nice cd of a selection of Mozart's best works as well.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved over the standard dvd version that I reviewed above as well.  Although a digital copy is included I have no views on that as I don't have any use for a digital copy really.<br /><br />This is a very fine blu-ray release and is among the best that I've seen so far.

B001DEVZUG|2.0|I'm not going to review the CD since there will be plenty of reviews for that on the single disc version page. This review is strictly in regards to the packaging and bonus DVD on the limited edition 2 disc version.    First, the packaging on this edition is the same as with the \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" limited edition. A cardboard gatefold sleeve with the discs loose inside.. no protective sleeves, so they are scratched from the moment you remove them.    The DVD: Video quality is poor. Sound is 2.0 Dolby Digital. There is no \\"Play All\\" function and each video is a separate title, so the disc returns to the menu after every video. \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" has been redubbed using the album version, not the proper single mix (resulting in lots of black screen at the end while the song finishes). \\"Pavement Cracks\\" is the worst made-up video ever, with static shots of Annie singing the song live, overdubbed with the album version which doesn't match, and to top it off, they left the TCR timecode showing thru most of the video so it looks really stupid.      I can't recommend this version at all.
B001GCUER0|1.0|I don't get it, the rave reviews, the awards, totally unreal.  I was so excited when this show was airing, watched several episodes just hoping it would get better it never did.  The characters are bland with no substance, the plot is always the same.  The 60's were better than this show represents by a long shot. It's unreal that this series can be in the second season going on 3.  Breaking Bad is great, Rome was superb, Big Love is fantastic, The Tudors, excellant, Damages, intriguing, Dexter is interesting (& those are all the series I have or will have on dvd) but Mad Men is depressing and disappointing to the nth degree.
0061562408|5.0|I loved reading this book.  If you are a dog lover, a dog owner, or someone thinking about raising a dog, you should read this book.  Although it is a work of fiction, and has nothing to do with training dogs, reading this book will make you love your dog that much more.  It's true.  The story is written from the dog's point of view.  And some things about dog-logic are really funny...the evil zebra...the crows...    I will probably re-read this story again because I enjoyed it so much.    As an aside, I found that the large print edition was extremely easy on the eyes.  It's nice to be able to enjoy a novel without having to strain to read the words.  It makes the novel feel that much more relaxing to read.

B00003CWN3|4.0|Brandon Teena (born Teena Brandon) was a young transgendered female-to-male. Brandon was brutally murdered in 1993. Hilary Swank does a phenomenal and Oscar-winning job of recreating the end of Brandon's life.<br /><br />This is a dark, and profoundly distressing film. Even if Brandon's life story were not known, it could be surmised by this brief recitation of facts: A young transgendered girl is born in Lincoln, Nebraska, and upon leaving home sets out for---an insular rural town.<br /><br />The real tragedy of Brandon's life is that Brandon might have found far more acceptance in an anonymous large city, like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, or even Chicago. Instead, Brandon exhibited a tendency toward poor choices (including busts for check fraud); settling in a one-stoplight town whose younger inhabitants had the limited horizons brought on by chronic unemployment, heavy drinking, petty crime, meth addiction, and violent boredom, was a fatal mistake.<br /><br />Brandon suffered from the same myopia. At one point, Brandon discusses with friends the ambition of owning a trailer park. Despite Brandon's very unorthodox identity, Brandon's imaginative worldview was dreary.  Instead of seeking out similar peers, Brandon chose friends whose natural tendency was to have the narrowest outlook.<br /><br />Truly benighted, two of Brandon's friends raped and beat Brandon when they discovered Brandon's physical identity. After Brandon reported the attack, the two men were brought in for questioning, but were not charged (the local Sheriff referred to Brandon in death several times as \\"It\\"). After their release, they killed Brandon.<br /><br />Swank plays Brandon sympathetically, but not without acknowledging some serious flaws of character. The miserable atmosphere of this film is its own indictment.<br /><br />It is truly troubling that anyone would choose to kill a person like Brandon \\"just because\\" Brandon was who Brandon was. As sad as the unneccessary death of Brandon was, the environment that spawned such an event is even more sorrowful, especially since it simply doesn't have to be so.ned such an event is even more sorrowful, especially since it simply doesn't have to be so.

B001PE26QQ|4.0|In the tradition of Jet Li's \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Fist of Legend\\", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal \\"Shah Po Lang\\" in 2005. \\"IP MAN\\" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of \\"Wing Chun\\" (said to have been invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.<br /><br />In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Fong Sai-Yuk learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.<br />Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....<br /><br />The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.<br /><br />There is very minor characterization involved. The film has two acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act is the effect of the Japanese invasion to the Chinese people, and the hardships of Master Ip and his family--which eventually leads to the film's encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.<br /><br />As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and some acrobatics. Highlights include Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Yip and company knows how to shoot and edit fight scenes to make their actors look good; it proves to be the film's main showstopper.<br /><br />The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's \\"Ip Man\\" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure is more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in \\"using his fists\\" to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a \\"based on true events\\" type of deal.<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in \\"Once upon a Time in China\\" and Huo Yuan Jia in \\"Fearless\\") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. \\"IP MAN\\" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring \\"IP MAN 2\\", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, Wong Kar-Wai's version of \\"IP MAN\\" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance than action thrills.<br /><br />Still, this film comes with a \\"Highly Recommended\\" rating from me, it does RULE as a martial arts action film.

B000IOM0YC|5.0|As a spectacular epic production, Warren Beatty's \\"Reds\\" is a marvelous choice for release in the Blu Ray format.  Even without this high definition enhancement, the intelligence of the film and the superlative performances by its all-star cast make it unusually rewarding.  The production's richly detailed evocation of life in the early 20th Century and its cast-of-thousands sequences of spectacular action benefit enormously from the great great increase in sharpness that the format provides.  I hope that many of the screen's classic historic epics will soon join this one on Blu Ray discs.

0061478784|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is a brilliant book, well on its way to becoming a classic.  With its spare language and dense content it's like a poem.  With its suggestions, hints, and wickedly unreliable narrator, it's like a puzzle.  With its allusions both overt and subtle, it's a gateway book:  Jones sends the reader out of the story world to visit or re-visit everything from Donne, Shakespeare, and Austen to folklore, botany, and rugby songs (which, as this reader has learned, can be really, really raucous).  These forays are worth the effort.  You return to HMC with better understanding of bookish Sophie, vain Howl, stern but loving Mrs. Pentstemmon, and the rest.    But as Calcifer, Howl's enigmatic fire demon, suggests, you really do have to watch and listen carefully.  Otherwise you might breeze right past what is really going on emotionally behind Howl's and Sophie's frantic teasing, bantering, arguing, sulking, cleaning, courting, \\"exploiting,\\" slithering out, slicing suits to ribbons in fits of jealousy, and so on.  Very deftly, Jones demonstrates the real pain that both characters bring to the story.  Part of solving the puzzle is in realizing that Howl and Sophie each have strong defenses and idiosyncratic, often very funny, ways of dealing with feelings and drives for which they are not prepared.  Howl's Moving Castle is, after all, the fairy-tale romance of a young woman who emotionally is an old woman, and a young man who emotionally is a boy.    Depending on the reader's age and perspective, it is also a clear-eyed look at marriage in all its aspects, from the mundane--washing dishes and cleaning toilets--to the mystical--both partners' dead-on capacity  to heal one another's deepest psychic wounds, all the while driving each other stark raving bananas.    Highly recommended.

So far I have tried couple of eggplant recipes, pistachio cookies and baked okra. All came out great. Their recipes in Guardian-online are fun as well.   Having said that, I wish they had serving suggestions in this book for recipes. It would also help to have some sample menus, specially for someone new to Mediterranean cooking.   I live in US and as such the book is cumbersome to use because of metric system used throughout. I don't mind that much, but it would have been nice to include a conversion table somewhere. Hopefully, there will be a US edition soon, but I could not wait for it to come out.   The book is beautifully laid out and the pictures are very tempting.   Overall, I like the book a lot.
1400152151|5.0|Sure I'm not trying to \\"review\\" whether one of the most remarkable pieces of scientific work ever is good / no-good. Let's take this text as an institution.    I chose the audio format for bicycle and car rides. The narrating well suites the content. An American accent reading very British English does not irritate my (though non-native) ear. The frequent extracts in French and in German hint that the reader knows the former but not the latter.    The narrating is far older than the indicated 2006 for MP3 format. The text was read some two decades ago and originally delivered on tape. Few minor features are left - single occasion of: \\"Please turn the tape...\\" and few file seams of the total of some 200 mp3 files are hearable. The file names in the two discs cause the alphabetical ordering to interleave the files. Keep the files in separate folders to avoid a total mess.    On the whole, most recommendable.

This is a beautiful toy that children can use there imagination when they play.

I knew about his growing up in my state, but didn't know a lot more beyond his experience in Chicago.  In tracing his family history and learning and meeting his family in Kenya, Pres. Obama really found his true self and that of his father whom he never really knew.  His book is extremely interesting and insightful and I feel as fulfilled about knowing him as he too learned about himself.  This book is a 5-star and everyone should read it.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|First of all run for your lives!!!!  If a monster invaded my town and friends were dying I sure would not video tape it.<br /><br />The movie starts off good enough and the first 15 minutes are easily the best.  The movie starts off as a love story and the main character taped his first date with his love.  The video is than shot over when the monster attacks New York.  This is somewhat of an interesting idea using the old video footage to tell the back story.<br /><br />However things go from good to really bad in the blink of an eye.  Much like the Blair Witch the character is running with his video camera and the movie is shown thru his camera.  This causes several jerky scenes and I thought I would have a siezure.<br /><br />All in all the movie was not beliveable, the movie was not very realistic (ok a monster attacking is not realistic to start with), who video tapes themself running for their lives?
B001CZVVXW|5.0|I agree with each of the reviews that praise this production of Carmen.  However, the reason I am writing a review is to tell you that Blu-Ray truly delivers on this disc!  The production quality is excellent on every level.  Picture quality is superb.  The camera gives a blend of audience views and up-close views without becoming distracting.  But, it is the music that will thrill you.  And isn't that why you buy opera discs?  The sound is delivered in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (stereo is an option).  I recently upgraded both my blu-ray player and pre-amp so I can play audio/video blu-ray discs like this one via HDMI.  What a treat to play this Blu-Ray opera and feel the satisfaction of superb high quality sound in my home theater.  I hope there are more discs like this one in the future.  But, for now, get this and enjoy every moment!  Marcus

Not just an 80s refresh band, nor a simple electro-pop ensemble content on producing electronic beats combined with spoken word vocals, they redefined what synth could and should sound like, and singlehandedly started a new era of electropop. The compositional strength of each track and the undeniable pop hooks (sometimes buried under discordant beats) elevated GIVE UP over everything else on the market at the time.<br /><br />Fundamentally well written songs with entertaining lyrics, dueling male and female vocalists (NOTHING BETTER), sometimes highbrow sometimes sentimental topically, a touch of science fiction, and always delightfully sparse beats make for an imaginative and poignant album.<br /><br />Now, with DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE on their 7th album [[ASIN:1423462459 Narrow Stairs]] those who wrote them off as a distraction or as unmelodic quasi-music doomed to fail now look like total fools. THE POSTAL SERVICE's GIVE UP is where it all began, and is still perhaps the best synth-pop album ever made. It should be an instant purchase for any indy music fan, and a welcome addition to a serious music fan's collection.<br /><br />5/5. A classic.
B000V86OKG|5.0|One of the most fascinating shows to ever grace the cable television. This show projects an eclectic marriage of emotions, which - though inherently incompatible - render synergistic results. Michael C. Hall is indescribably poignant; his off-beat character execution is absolutely stunning. Who would have thought that a serial killer could capture so any hearts in affection. Death has never looked so good, and felt so right.

0307455874|5.0|As a Hawaiian and resident of the state of Hawaii, I was very interested in knowing a lot more about President Obama and what he stands for.  His messages throughout this book clearly provides his vision for American.  His campaign was a refelction of this throughout and now you can begin to see his vision become a reality.  A wonderful book for all to enjoy and learn about our 44th president.

After listening to some samples, I bought it. And I am very happy with the whole CD...much good music.  Now I want to see the movie!

B000FC1K66|3.0|Let me start by saying I have not seen the movie version of this book starring Kate Winslet.  It did help having the vision of Kate playing Hannah in this book because you can visualize the story taking place.    The book is divided in three parts.  If I were to rate this book based on the first chapter, it is a 5+ star.  This starts out with a bang.  You fully dive into the relationship of the young boy and Hannah.  The author is masterful in describing their relationship, the scenery and you feel as if you are in the room.  Unfortunately, this part of the book set up such high expectations for the rest of the book that I became disappointed.    Parts Two and Three of the books dive into how Hannah comes back into the young boys life.  I won't write about this as it gives away too much of the plot of the novel.  I believe the author did a wonderful job of pulling their lives back together; however, it left me wanting more.  When I finished the book, I still didn't feel like I knew Hannah or why she did what she did.  I wanted more from the relationship.  I wanted to hear more about the impact of Hannah on his life other than reflections back in time.  I guess my expectations were just so high based on the expert writing of the first part of this book.    The chapters are short which makes this book a breeze to read through.  I am looking forward to seeing the movie as I can see them taking the flashbacks to the concentration camps to a much higher level than what I received from the book.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|Really excellent music. This album was the very reason that I buy music like this in the first place. Forgive my naivete, try to understand I am not familiar with this band but I am familiar with King Crimson (Robert Fripp), Peter Gabriel, Genesis, Gentle Giant, Mahavishnu, Tony Williams Lifetime, Jack Bruce, & Eno. They have obviously alot of influence with King Crimson (to my ears anyway) as well as Genesis in particular. It is a very refreshing & enlightening experience to listen to this Van der Graff Generator Album (Pawn Hearts specifically). Quite enjoyable actually. I picked up \\"The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other\\" by Van der Graff awhile back, & while it is good I will need to listen to it several more times for it to sink in. Pawn Hearts, on the other hand, is EXACTLY what I expected!!! sinister, macabre, with excellent musicianship/masterful performances, heavy organ, & odd time signatures. What more could a Prog Rocker ask for?!?! LOVE IT & that's only after 1 listen!!! I intend to continue exploring the works of this incredible underated band!!!

And even if you've never seen an issue of the magazine but you just love hip young creative unpretentious interiors you should get yourself a copy of this gem. I can't wait every month to get my issue of Domino magazine and this book is just as enticing. Beautifully photographed and not just everything I've seen in the magazine.
B001F0RA4S|4.0|This is a masterful book and was worthy of the Pulitzer prize of which it was a winner.<br /><br />The book's plot deals with the intersection of the lives of 3 women, each living in a different time - Virginia Wolff, Clarissa Dalloway, and Ms. Brown (mother of Clarissa's friend).<br /><br />Connected through stream of consciousness, entwined by the thoughts and<br />works of Virginia Wolff, this novel is a deep and profound exploration of depression, loss and despair.<br /><br />I usually don't like movie versions of books but this movie did the book justice.  I highly recommend both the book and the movie.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|Movies whose imagery are clearly the combination of live-action with animation are rare, with maybe one major release every year.  Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit are two examples.  For 2009, Speed Racer was the only live-action animated combo movie, and did not do that well at the theaters.  The movie tries to combine several themes, and tries to come of as a serious movie.  There is the overall racing theme of the movie, which of course drives the special effects.  Then there is the requisite romance between Speed Racer (yes the movie is named after the title character) and his girlfriend.  There is also the tense relationship between Speed Racer and his fellow racers in the final cross-country marathon.  And like any good sports movie, we have the corrupt businessmen who try and fix the sport for profit.  All told, an alright movie.  At times the animation gets in the way of the storyline with the bright colors.  But still entertaining.

1563894696|1.0|This highly acclaimed book does actually start off strong as an exciting noirish Batman tale.  Unfortunately it only gets worse and worse, concluding with a more than sub par ending.  Terrible writing as usual from author Jeph Loeb, who's work as usual resembles terrible fan fiction rather than a professionallly written story.  Avoid this and other works by Loeb.      For a really superb Batman story, look up Batman Year One and The Dark Knight Returns.  Other excellent superhero works include, All Star Superman, New X-Men by Grant Morrison, Kingdom Come, Planetary, and Powers.

B000001GQP|5.0|Despite the ubiquity of \\"O fortuna\\", Orff's Carmina Burana is no unqualified masterpiece. At the same time I think it is a better work than some of its many detractors give it credit for. Whatever the case may be, there should at least be no doubt that Jochum's version is, by some distance, the best on disc. He treats it with a level of respect and attention to detail that is hardly rivaled elsewhere, and his tempo decisions and view of structure seems immensely right, without exception. The Berlin Deutsche Oper Chorus sings with tremendous power, and (rather obviously) there are no rivals for his soloists: Janowitz is splendid, especially in the more lyrical parts, and Stolze and Fischer-Dieskau sing assuredly with the requisite variety. In short, you don't get a better recording of the work than this one, and I think modern conductors and orchestras, instead of trying to compete, really ought to focus on something else - lots of great choral-orchestral works out there equal to or superior to than this one which have never obtained advocacy like this. The remastered sound is truly astonishing as well.

He spent just the right amount of time on the main characters, there were many twists in the story that were hard to see coming, and the ending was quite wonderful. The only thing wrong with the novel is that there isn't a sequel to follow it!

B001PR0XYA|5.0|Vikings and aliens together would generally be a bad movie on the sci fi channel. but this was actually very good. of course there is a little cheesiness, but the special effects and decent acting make up for it. this movie was the most entertaining movie i have seen in a long time. it reminded me of predator alot.
B00009XITQ|5.0|I love this movie because it is funny, heartwarming and entertaining. The combination talents of Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are perfect match for this movie. Not to mention the wonderful voice of Oliver James. I have watched this movie over and over again. ;-)
B00006AL1G|4.0|While this documentary is almost 10 years old, it's still a great window into the DJ aspect of hip-hop. (For those who don't know hip-hop consist of rap, DJ, breaking, and graffiti.) It's starts from Grand Wizard Theodore and Grandmaster DDT through to DJ Premier and Q-Bert. It mainly consists of interviews with a little show footage. It's great to see the history of DJ-ing and how it's evolved throughout the world.
B000001IPL|3.0|Smash by Offspring was a great album for its time. I used to listen to this cd when I was in junior high, the sound is very nostalgic for me. The songs released Gotta Get Away, Self-Esteem, and Come Out and Play still hold up but the rest of the songs fall flat. Smash brings back a lot of great memories, but this album isn't perfect.
B001GKYBXA|2.0|If you're a fan of Revolution 9, buy this CD. Except for 2 or 3 decent cuts (Light From Your Lighthouse is my favorite and the main reason I rate this 2 stars), I found the rest of this effort a total waste.  It's mostly a collection of noise I wouldn't consider to be music.  Certainly not worthy of Paul McCartney.  I guess there are many people who like this stuff.  Just look at the many positive Amazon reviews.  I'm sorry.  I just don't get it.  For me, this CD will never again be played. It's nowhere, man.
B001DEVZUG|4.0|When it has came to down to female artists, a lot of them right now are just about being a pretty face, and not about the substance. Which is very sad because there are fewer female acts that really have great material like Alicia Keys, and newcomer Leona Lewis to just show as a few examples. For older acts though like Annie Lennox, it has been nearly 30 years since she delivered as a part of Eurythmics with Dave Stewart in the 80's, and then boldly broke out on her own. While she has had a few hits collections, there is nothing from the British Chameleon to make her marks on her own as a solo bird. With Annie's every-changing style, it has kept swiftly well with her music, and now her first solo collection is finally out that says that she isn't walking on broken glass anymore.<br /><br />The Annie Lennox Collection is a well-delivering solo hits collection for anyone who has been a huge fan of her solo works from the 90's and 2000 decades. The songs have all been remastered and delivers most of her best as a solo songbird. There are a lot of great songs here from her solo works, 1995's cover album Medusa, 2003's Bare, Songs Of Mass Destruction and her brekathough solo debut album 1992's Diva. The collection handles well, and reintroduces Annie's haunting style in her voice, and the appealing classics noblely. The collection in cludes a lot of her big hits staples including the haunting Grammy-Winning No More I Love You's, her intorductions on her own including Walking On Broken Glass, and the deep and mellowly-somber Why (which was later featured in the Whoopi Goldberg film Boys On The Side), as well as some of lesser-known hits like Pavement Cracks and her cover of A Whiter Shade Of Pale. While the collection is mostly solid, there were though a few of her solo works that could've been highlighted here including her duet with Al Green on Put A Little Love In Your Heart from the classic Bill Murray film Scrooged, as well as her Oscar-wiining song Into The Wild from the Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King.<br /><br />All in all, despite a few overlooked colors from the chameleon Annie Lennox has made so well all these years, The Annie Lennox Collection is still a strong collection that reintroduces Annie's brilliant and charming appeal, to a new generation of fans well. So if you're looking for an alternative from a world of wannabe divas like Rihanna or the broken-down Britney Spears, than give The Annie Lennox Collection a whirl and you'll wonder why she her spell is still strong, and not a darker shade of pale.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-rd Of The Rings: Return Of The King.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|I love the remastered Star Trek.  The enhanced clarity and color are fantastic.  The music has been re-recorded and beautiful.  I love the special effects.  The Enterprise in space is beautiful and breathtaking.  There are suprises in the episodes like in Amok Time where Kirk, Spock and McCoy transport down to Vulcan and there is a long shot of them walking across a natural stone arch to the arena perched on a butte with a Vulcan city in the distance.  Beautiful!
B000003N7F|4.0|A Love Supreme is generally viewed as John Coltrane's masterpiece.  That clearly seems to be the view of most reviewers here on Amazon.  As I write this review, the album has received 118 5-star reviews out of 131 (just counting reviews associated with editions linked by Amazon to this one).  So, 90% of reviewers give it 5 stars.  But more than that, the titles of the reviews reflect extreme passion and devotion: \\"The best album ever\\", \\"A Jazz Masterpiece by the 'Trane\\", \\"Immense and Beyond Category\\", \\"A true religious experience\\", \\"One of History's Masterpieces\\", \\"One of the Greatest Albums Ever Made!\\", etc.  Some reviewers even claim that this album is \\"proof that God exists\\".    However, I find myself compelled to disagree with the majority view.  While I think the album is a very good album that is daring, passionate, and musically inventive, I feel that Coltrane fell short of acomplishing his stated goals of making a humble offering to God and inspiring his listeners to share his faith.  In particular, I feel that his playing in the first and third movements is self-indulgent, chaotic, and (at times) both ugly and out of control.  While I do not doubt Coltrane's sincerity, his playing does not make me appreciate God's love, mercy, or grace (except in the softer, hymn-like 4th movement).  While I listen to lots of jazz and rock music, I also like classical music including symphonies, opera, and even religious works (masses, cantatas) by composers like Beethoven, Mahler, Mozart, and Bach.  There are many beautiful works by these composers that convey great sadness, peace, love, and faith in God and stir my emotions much more than A Love Supreme does.    That's not to say that I doubt the sincerity of other reviewers who have indicated that the album does stir these emotions or religious feelings in them.  But the album doesn't really touch me on an emotional level in the ways that Coltrane intended; at most, the frenetic playing of Coltrane and his talented bandmates inspires feelings of excitement and irritation in me. My first impression on hearing this album was hat Coltrane was full of anger, not love.  Perhaps,being an atheist, I'm just not receptive to his message. However, I do feel moved by classical music inspired by God despite my lack of faith. So, I ultimately feel that Coltrane hasn't really communicated (to me) the feelings he seemed to be aiming for, with the exception of the 4th movement.    Ironically, I feel Coltrane did communicate peace, love, and beauty much more effectively in his Crescent album from the same year.  I consider that album better than this one.    One possibility here is that Coltrane meant to depict his struggle to find and stick with God and that the first few movements are supposed to express that struggle and are therefore not intended to convey the feelings of love and peace that I expected.  But the titles of the movements and the liner notes do not indicate this.  If that was his intention, then I might listen to the album in a different way and come to a different conclusion.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I purchased this CD not expecting anything... it is hard to find an album that has great music on every track, but that is what you get here! Do not hesitate, especially if you liked the movie...
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele has this wonderful quality to her voice that reminds me of smoke in a jazz club. It's fantastic.<br /><br />It's very rare to find a CD that I can listen to each and every song without having to skip a single track. Wonderfully done!
0385338724|5.0|I really love Sophie Kinsella. I think her female lead characters are so funny. So of course I loved this book. There were several funny moments. The plot line was also a little bit different than any other story I had read before, so that made it even more interesting. I can't wait for her next book to come out.
B000002I53|5.0|This is really a beautiful album from Coltrane, recorded in 1960.  It offers a collection of 4 famous standards from 3 American composers. These are Richard Rodgers' \\"My Favorite Things\\" from the 1959 musical \\"The Sound of Music\\", Cole Porter's \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye\\" from the 1944 musical review \\"Seven Lively Arts\\", George Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" from the 1935 opera \\"Porgy and Bess\\", and Gershwin's \\"But Not for Me\\" from the 1930 musical \\"Girl Crazy\\".<br /><br />Other reviewers have already analyzed the performances of the 4 tunes.  Note that you also get 2 bonus tracks which include parts 1 and 2 of the single version of \\"My Favorite Things\\" which leave out much of Coltrane's extended solo from the full 14 minute version.  So, I'll just note that this is a very good album for people nervous about Coltrane's reputation to start out with.  It is more accessible than \\"A Love Supreme\\" or other late Coltrane albums, primarily because you'll probably recognize the tunes, but also because Coltrane plays in a very lyrical fashion.  But the playing of the entire ensemble is also quite inventive.  Another good album for Coltrane neophytes to start with is \\"Blue Train\\" from 1957.
0449227421|2.0|The Third Twin is the first and last Ken Follett book I will read.  The idea for the plot was clever, but it was not carried off well, and the characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable.  What annoys me most is that throughout the book Follett reveals himself again and again to be an ill-informed liberal fool, and I do not suffer fools gladly.    Follett's villains in the novel are conservative Republicans, and Follett shows woeful ignorance about politics and history.  Follett's Republicans are ardent racists, a foolish assertion.    The Democrat Party viewed slavery as a positive good. While Republicans were ending slavery, Democrats worked actively against the Union effort.  Democrats defeated Reconstruction and on its ruins created Jim Crow.  Democrats fought against the 15th Amendment, which gave voting rights to all races.  Republican Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to invite a black to the White House for dinner.  Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the same era was the quintessential racist. In the 1920's the Republican Party called for anti-lynching legislation, while Democrats blocked it.  Even the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Republicans over the protests of many Democrats.  Throughout history Republicans have worked for racial equality, Democrats have not.      Follett says that the Watergate scandal \\"discredited conservatism,\\" another ignorant contention.  In the first place Richard Nixon was not a conservative.  Furthermore, the Watergate break-in was not a dictate of conservatism, but of paranoia.  Conservatism stands for law and order.    One of Follett's evil Republicans plans to run for President.  Listen to this:  \\"his campaign promise:  ten percent income tax, paid for by the abolition of welfare.\\"  Can Follett name ANY Republican president who has cut welfare, let alone abolished it?  How silly!  Only liberal loonies think you have to \\"pay for\\" a tax cut.  Every tax cut in history has increased revenue.  Good examples are the tax reductions by Presidents Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush II.  By cutting the income tax 30%, Reagan DOUBLED revenue to the federal government.    The atheistic Follett naturally has his evil conservatives be God-fearing Christians, yet he mentions one of them belonging to the Episcopalian Church.  Follett is so ignorant that he thinks a church is a church is a church, little realizing that this is an ultra-liberal church which a conservative Republican would not likely choose.  At one point Follett uses the simile \\"as dull as a sermon,\\" which leads me to believe that HE may have at some time attended an Episcopalian Church, as the only boring sermons I have heard were in liberal churches.    Follett's ignorance overwhelms me.  One character is making meatloaf by browning chopped hamburger and onions in a skillet.  Another character is handcuffed to the pee-trap pipe under a bathroom basin.  Follett does not realize that a 10-year-old couch potato could easily knock this pipe loose.  One character convicted of rape and arson receives a five-year sentence--impossibly lenient.    There are many more examples of Follett's ignorance, foolishness, and personal bias, but I think this is sufficient to demonstrate why I will never ready another book that he has written.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 6 and 8 year old girls really enjoy this game... almost as much as we do!  It is best if played with 4 people, but can be played with 2 or 3 if necessary.  It is very addictive.      I rated \\"durability\\" 3 stars simply because the plastic pieces look like they would snap quite easily, especially in the hands of a rambunctious child.  You must also be careful not to lose any pieces.  Some are quite small and could easily be lost.  The functionality of the game would suffer if that were to happen.

B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is Springsteen's usual very good album.  Some songs are outstanding, some average and a few I don't care for in the limited time I have listened to them..  But even those will become favorites in time.    Working On A Dream, My Lucky Day, Good Eye, Kingdom of Days and even Queen of the Supermarket are some of my  favorites.  A must have for even the casual fan!
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Fabulous blu ray- this first Daniel Craig Bond flick is much better than the second one!  Great visual images and character development!
B00062IVKS|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since it opened.  I think it was dark, confusing and overwhelming.  I tended to avoid it over the years because of what I perceived as its length and how good the movie really was.  Seeing it now is a revelation.  I am able to comprehend it more and found it wonderful.  (I was a teenager in 1980.)  Robert De Niro does a wonderful job as Jake LaMotta, one of the great boxers but an ignorant man who was brutal in all areas of his life.  The story is laid out without explanation from the filmmakers.  We don't empathize with the character nor totally despise him.  Jake LaMotta is who is and no one else.  Still, the movie is a statement in itself for making films in a different way and as art.  Martin Scorcesse deliberately makes a film that defies the rules in much the same way Jake La Motta found himself defying rules in order to box.  He constantly breaks down barriers and walls and never gives up.  People reject him and leave him but he doesn't stop.  I think Scorcesse sees that in himself in making this film.  Even to film in black and white would have caused problems with the film studios.  What a wonderful film it is.
0689859368|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of this book that my daughter brought home from the library, but on her recommendation, I thought I'd give it a try.  Fabulous!  Filled with spine-chilling tension, we move with the Grace children into a spooky old Victorian house.  Twins Jared and Simon are nine and sister Mallory is 13.  Immediately upon arrival, strange sounds can be heard from between the walls of the house.  Spare, yet excellent descriptive writing creates trepidation and mystery.  I even held my breath at one point.  A quick read at just under an hour...definitely worth your time.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is a great album, a true artistic stretch once again. I was shocked to see so many bad reviews, but something tells me a few John Mcain lovers felt a little left out. As always, the harshest critics are those who never dare to create or take risks themselves. I have read the bad reviews and clearly many have not been able to reach beyond high school and grow into maturity with Bruce. I think this album should win 2-5 grammys. Every song is great, many harken back to an older, 70's feel lyrically, a few take me back to the Born In The USA era. I think this decade has brought his best work. When I first listened to the rising I didn't like it that much, now it is one of my favorites, and I suspect some of the lower reviews may have this same issue. Bruce changes and grows so much between albums, that it can be hard to digest at first, then a few months later it just sounds like another Springsteen album. I find the tunes here to be very melodic, and I keep hearing them in my head all day long. The video has an awesome, mind blowing song on it that all Halloween lovers will love. I really thank Bruce for this treat, and think maybe he should try to do a movie if he can act that good. If you're a Bruce fan, you'll love this. I loved this one on the first play. It ain't Born to run, but we already have that album. Quality wise, I consider this just as good, just different. Bruce does speak to working man on this more than he has in 24 years, and yes that's an authentic voice, he is a working man, and he got rich through hard work and his own creativity, not stealing people's 401k money, or taking a huge salary to run a comapany he didn't even start. There is no shame in making a fortune from your own creativity and hard work. Bruce doesn't hire a Chinese guy to go out on stage for him, he does the work, and the sound and production put into this album had to be a lot of work. Great Job Bruce.

B0006ZE7G2|1.0|I noticed that you failed to mention Richard Wright in your reply to B. Alexander! It seems to me that Richard Wright was and has been the most maligned, mistreated and ignored member of \\"Pink Floyd\\", and if \\"Pulse\\" and \\"Delicate...\\" are not, to many of you, the \\"real\\" \\"Pink Floyd\\" then the same can be said of \\"The Final Cut\\", which to me was really Roger Waters first solo Album with the \\"Pink Floyd\\" name slapped on it so Roger could suck as much money off of the \\"Pink Floyd\\" name as he could get!     I can see how you might think David Gilmour, Syd Barret and Roger Waters would be part, and I stress PART of the \\"Creative Core\\" of \\"Pink Floyd\\", but to add Nick Mason to that \\"Creative Core\\" of \\"Pink Floyd\\" before and without even mentioning Richard Wright is Asinine!    Nick Mason was a great drummer, no doubt about that, but a drummer nontheless his input being 1 piece, \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" that he wrote for the album \\"Ummagumma\\" no vocals on that song that I remember! The only times Mason's voice has been included on Pink Floyd's albums are \\"Corporal Clegg\\", the single spoken line in \\"One of These Days\\" and spoken parts of \\"Signs of Life\\" and \\"Learning to Fly\\" (the latter taken from actual recording of Mason's first solo flight) from \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\"! He does, however, sing lead vocals on two unreleased but heavily bootlegged tracks, \\"Scream Thy Last Scream\\" (1967) and \\"The Merry Xmas Song\\" (1975-1976). In live performances of the song \\"Sheep\\", he did the spoken section and yet you consider him to be member of the \\"Creative Core\\" of \\"Pink Floyd\\"!    You can't be so dense to the \\"Creative Input\\" from \\"Richard Wright\\" can you? Though not as prolific a songwriter as his bandmates Roger Waters and David Gilmour, he wrote significant parts of the music for classic albums such as Meddle, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, as well as for Pink Floyd's final studio album The Division Bell!  \\"Richard Wright\\"  was the keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter, best known for his career with Pink Floyd! Wright's richly textured keyboard layers were a vital ingredient and a distinctive characteristic of Pink Floyd's sound. Wright frequently sang background and occasionally lead vocals onstage and in the studio with Pink Floyd (most notably on the songs \\"Time\\", \\"Echoes\\", and on the Syd Barrett composition \\"Astronomy Domine\\")!
B00006CXSS|4.0|I bought this series for my husband for Valentine's Day. He is stationed in IRAQ, He has always loved watching this when it was on TV. He and his fellow soldiers are enjoying reliving and watching it all over again. Purchasing it was so easy and it arrived quickly so that I could send it to him in time for Valentine's Day.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|You need this movie for your Western Collection!  Husband had never seen it!  He's working in a remote area of New Mexico staying in a travel trailer so I try to keep him in movies and books.  He watched this one all in one night, so it must have held his attention!
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|I purchased this for my daughter.  I remember her watching this when she was younger when it originally aired.  My daughter is 27 now and has a child of her own.  We are going to enjoy it together.  I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  I am sure good discussions will generate from it. This is one of the best canceled TV shows.
0312944098|4.0|Let's start with a quick confession: I read this novel without the slightest idea that it's a modern-day retelling of the \\"Count of Monte Cristo.\\" More importantly, I've never read \\"The Count\\" nor seen it performed on the stage. In fact, I don't even know the basic storyline. Shame on me.<br /><br />That said, I must say that I enjoyed \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" and would recommend it to others -- if only for the wonderful British accents and highly inventive plot. Pick it up for your next vacation or plane trip.<br /><br />THE STORY UNFOLDS: Our hero, Danny Cartwright, is a kind-hearted but illiterate East End mechanic when his best friend (and future brother-in-law) Bernie is suddenly murdered outside a pub. Danny is falsely accused by three aristocratic nasties and he ends up in Belmarsh Prison. By a simple twist of fate, Danny is incarcerated with a disgraced Scottish army officer named Nick Moncrieff and his big lunk of an Army friend. Nick encourages Danny to study and refine his manners. Following the unfortunate demise of Sir Nicholas, Danny assumes Nick's identity - just as he's about to be paroled.<br /><br />Now free from prison, Danny proceeds to battle Nick's corrupt uncle Hugo Moncrieff for his grandfather's enormous fortune and world-class stamp collection. Meanwhile, he's also plotting revenge against his three rich accusers. Enter a host of lesser players, including various Swiss bankers, policemen, actors and lawyers. Stir this mix and you end up with an highly entertaining -- and very unpredictable -- denouement.<br /><br />Fine stuff indeed. Thank you, Jeffrey Archer. Now I'll have to read the \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" so I won't have to hang my head in shame for the rest of eternity.

0321525655|2.0|I was really disappointed with this book, perhaps because of the expectations I built after reading the positive reviews. The book lacks originality as many of the key concepts are based on other books.     The author assumes that slides in a presentation should remain very simple with one chart perhaps and/or very few bullet points in each, which I agree is more elegant in the case of live presentations. Often however, business reports come in \\"power point\\" formats and are meant to be read without the presence of a presenter, and therefore have to be more comprehensive.    The samples of slides displayed in the book are very well designed and inspiring, which I thought was perhaps the strong point of this book.
0060989157|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who grew up listening to THE BEST 80's rock band.  I'm not a big reader, but I could not put this book down. I would recommend this book to anyone who, at the very least, has heard of the CRUE.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I applauded what Al Gore did.  Should he have won the election in year 2000?  What would have the US and the world be like?  Was he that passionate about global warming back then or would he have been pulled left and right and not able to focus on the global warming issue if he were elected?      One can ask many \\"what ifs\\" to that year's election.  One thing one can be certain is that what happened gave Al Gore the chance to study and travel the globe to speak and educate us this pressing topic that needs all human beings attention NOW.  I am thankful Oprah featured his DVD on one of her shows so to give me the opportunity to rent this DVD.      To not spoil the movie for readers, I will only put the highlights of what I have learned.  Al Gore gave a presentation of what has been happening to the globe nowadays 1.) Climate change - Tornados, Hurricanes, Typhoons, draught, floods all because of the temperature change in the ocean 2.) The rising sea levels 3.) The destruction of habitat - e.g. Polar Bears 4.) How consistent the scientists have warned us about global warming issue.      It is a persuasive and powerful movie to wake us up to do every bit we can to slow down global warming and going green.  I am glad Al Gore now brings it to the screen for us to view.  The most striking scene is about that scale of balancing economy and the globe from a nation's perspective.  From a personal perspective, it is about balancing our own bank account versus the environment we live in.  Yet, it does not have to be completely that way.  If we see renewable energy, fuel efficient cars, recycling (does not cost us anything to recycle other than taking the time to separate garbage), conserving energy (saves us money but we need to be aware of what energy we are using at the moment) as an investment to a greener, cleaner globe, it is apparent that everyone can act on creating a greener, more environmental friendly globe.  We all just need to do our fair share and be aware of thelittle old habits have to do to mother Earth.     NOTE:  Al Gore has a web site that educates us how we can save energy in affordable ways.  It is worth reading and adopting some of his advice to our daily lives - many of his advice also help us save money in return!      Watch the movie and educate ourselves is great.  However, what actions are we going to take now is more important than just watching and educating ourselves about the issue.  One can maybe argue the details and the facts.  But the truth is that global warming (in general) is real and it is happening.  So, I ask the readers, myself the same questions Al Gore asked at the end of the movie.  Do we want a greener world to be passed on to our future generations by doing our share?  Or do we want to carry our old ways of living and let our dear innocent children, grandchildren to suffer the consequences of our own actions?  We get to make a choice today and let us make one, follow through the choice that shows integrity and compassion to the world    Thank you for reading my review.
0739367676|5.0|I was very pleased with this audio book. It's very well done and I love how her voice is very animated so you're aware of who's talking and gives a good feel for the mood, etc. There was also a guy's voice for Jacob, so it fits the character much better when it was from his point of view.
B001OW5NF0|2.0|Although parts of this book were a good review. Any writer who has spent much time in the craft will not find much new here. However, for novices just getting started, it could be very valuable and worth the read. The examples of bad writing the author offers are exteme (in the sense of being bad). Few writers, even novice, would write such tripe. If you are looking for \\"Writing 101,\\" look farther. This one is even simpler: \\"Writing 22\\" or so. I considered it a waste of time and money.

0307454894|5.0|I have two little girls, which makes it difficult for me to find time to read. This book was so good, it was difficult to put down. I finished it in two days, even woke up earlier than my daughters in order to continue my reading. I love the way the author presents his story, never attempting to explain Hannah's actions or lack there of. Instead he invites the audience to experience the rollercoaster of feelings and emotions Hannah put Micheal through. A love story as painful as love can be.

B001LMU182|1.0|I do not understand why on earth pioneer decided to ruin what was one of the most perfect animations ever. Some genius producer decided, hey, lets change the excellent original (orion/streamline) english voice actors and replace them with horrible new english voice actors.<br /><br />Of course, eventhough pioneer is not releasing this bluray, bandai in its infinite wisdom decided to use the pioneer dub as well..<br /><br />If you are a fan of the original VHS, do not, I repeat do NOT buy this bluray, they completely ruin the experience. Those great voice actors, and their catch phrases are no longer present.<br /><br />If you prefer listening in Japanese, as I do in for most anime (Akira obviously not included), then go ahead and buy it. Otherwise pull out the old vcr and pop in the original.. :)
B001K98MFU|5.0|Let us be blunt, the initial dvd release of \\"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\\" was flawed. From the subtitles that acted more like the captioning for the hearing impaired, standard sound and visual presentation. Never mind no option for listening to the film in english.    Bandai has now corrected the mistakes that were made upon the initial dvd release with a stunning blu-ray that is a must own for any anime or science fiction fan. The picture quality and detail now present is much better then ever before, the sound is incredible even on your regular speakers. The subtitles and languages are possibly though the biggest improvement. Bandai has given this release proper subtitles, including an option to even have the songs translated. They also have included the english language option which is the cast from the series and the previous movie.    Now the film itself is more philisophical than action orriented, this one continues on the themes of man, machine and the relations there in. This film is very much in the vein of Blade Runner, so if you are wanting a strong story that will actually make you think then you will enjoy. If you are expecting the non-stop action that some episodes of the series contained then you may be dissapointed.    This film is rated PG-13 and is recommend for mature viewer, not necissary due to the violence, but more because of the complexity of story and it's themes.    Final Grade: A
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I apologize to anyone offended by the title of my review, but if that sentence offended you in a way you'll never get over, this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood proves again that he is one of our most gifted directors and actors.  His films are ABOUT something and he consistently rises above expectations we might have because of watching films not as good as the ones he makes.  In the early part of \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" I thought I was watching a well-made remake of Rocky with a female boxer - then in the final act that movie became about something entirely different.<br /><br />Gran Torino shapes up like a mis-matched buddy film.  Later it begins to look like it will become Death Wish for the AARP.  Mr. Eastwood chooses projects that do not stick to formulas and we are the lucky benefactors of his unconventional choices.<br /><br />Clint portrays Walt Kowalski, and Walt is from that generation of men trained to keep their feelings inside, even when they've experienced the kind of horrors that win Silver Crosses in Korea.  The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife and we learn quickly that he is emotionally distant from both of his sons and their families.  They think he's a grumpy old coot - and he is - and he think's they're a bunch of lazy softies, raising selfish grand-children.<br /><br />After Korea Walt worked in the local Ford factory, and his prized possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he helped build and maintains in pristine condition.  A grand-daughter approaches grandpa after the funeral, asking Walt who he plans to... uh... you know... leave the car to after he, uh, you know....  Walt scowls silently in reply.  Walt scowls a lot, because if he doesn't like his own family you can imagine what he thinks about his neighborhood, where his fellow white auto-workers are moving out and the homes are increasingly inhabited by minorities.  A Hmong family lives next door, which is a difficult thing to accept for a man who killed many Asians in Korea.  Walt repeatedly orders anyone who steps a toe onto his property away.<br /><br />Rival Hmong gangs pass the days cruising the streets, talking tough and waving guns to demonstrate their machismo.  Thao, the teenaged boy from the family next door, is recruited by his cousin into one of the gangs.  Walt catches Thao trying to steal the prized car as gang initiation.<br /><br />Thao's mother and sister Sue come over the next day to make Thao apologize and offer a week of Thao's services to Walt to preserve the family honor.  Bee Vang performs serviceably as Thao, but Ahney Her as Sue is a find.  She is witty, spunky, friendly and has no difficulty standing up to Walt and the local gangstas.<br /><br />In the opening funeral we meet the local priest, Father Janovich (played with cherub-cheeked earnesty by Christopher Carley).  The kindly father tells Walt that he promised Mrs. Kowalski before she died that he would make Walt go to confession.  Walt tells the young priest in no uncertain terms that he has no intention of going to confession, but father doesn't give up on Walt, and we get the sense that it is as much out of honest human compassion and caring as trying to comply with the death-bed wish of Mrs. Kowalski.<br /><br />We get to see Walt grow, and he is as surprised as we are that he becomes closer to the family next door than he is to his own sons.  Thao grows also, partly because of Walt, and partly despite him.  The gruff epithet spouting part of Walt never goes away, so this is not a Disney-esque transformation.<br /><br />In one scene we see Walt take Thao to the local barber shop more to teach him to curse \\"like a man\\" than for a haircut, and in the next scene we see that Thao has learned his lesson well.  I saw a few reviews before the film, but hadn't seen a mention of the humor contained within the two-hour running time.  Humor changes with perspective though, and much comes from the openly racist Walt being forced into situations he ordinarily would never choose.  The Mrs. and I laughed often, as did the rest of the auditorium.  Despite the grouchy nature of the protagonist there is a good-hearted feeling that permeates the film.<br /><br />In the final reel things escalate between Walt, the neighbors and the gang-members.  I've seen reviews second-guessing the ending, but for the Walt we've come to know in the film, the ending makes perfect sense.f the auditorium.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|This dvd is absolutely fantastic. The music is gripping, especially the opening organ tune of the Phantom with its tremendous base. The songs are beautiful. Emmy Rossum, as Christine, sings with a heavenly voice and the way she looks at the phantom is nothing less than tantalizing. Even at the end when she gives him back the ring, there is a sense of pity and pathos mixed up with a desire that says I wish it could have been possible. Gerard Butler, as the Phantom, sings with singular emotion and is superb. Minnie Driver, as Carlota, is a source of much fun with her angry antics and she is priceless. I watched the dvd repeatedly having been enchanted by the grandeur of the story, the songs and lavish reproduction of the magnificent opera house and other settings. The production of the film cannot be faulted and the dvd does not miss anything.
B000VWYJ8G|1.0|Nice to see that I am not alone in my disappointment for this film, and for the same reason. The jiggly-cam effect is way over the top here. And it zooms in and out, then side to side...like some backyard birthday party using an 8mm camera from the 60's, shot by an excited parent. I couldn't finish watching for the headache that was induced. Sad, too, because I really like the Bourne franchise and was enjoying Matt Damon in the part, outsmarting and out-toughing all those other agents. It looked to me as if the director is trying to gimmick-up a bad film. Clearly Matt Damon can carry any film: from quiet and still to action-packed. But leave it to some Hollywood no-talent to screw it up. Should have been great, but instead delivers a sad, sad movie.
B000002G0P|5.0|During my early 20s, when the rest of the music-loving youth of the world had their Walkmans spinning Nirvana and Pearl Jam CDs during the overly-hyped era of grunge-rock, my new husband and I purchased this follow-up to my well loved \\"Pornograffitti\\" CD.  \\"III Sides to Every Story\\" was the 1st addition to our collective CD music library. Almost 17 years and 500 CD purchases later, both our marriage and this CD have stood the test of time, and \\"III Sides\\" is still our mutual favorite.  My husband is/was a fellow musician and metal head, while U2 was more my thing, but we BOTH love this CD and this band.  This album plays like Sgt. Pepper with a story and a purpose setting the musical landscape, and is more fully appreciated as a rock opera than a collection of well-performed and produced material, although it does hold its own in that respect as well.       I had the pleasure of witnessing these gentlemen perform this rock masterpiece from beginning to end during the tour to support it in 1993, and to this day I regard it as one of the best rock performances I've ever seen live on stage.      Most folks are familiar with \\"Warheads,\\" Rest in Peace,\\" and \\"Stop the World,\\" but I always believed \\"Am I Ever Gonna Change\\" was truly the show stopper on this one, and worth the price of the CD alone.      Many music critics identify Nuno as one of the most underrated and under-celebrated musicians of this generation.  With that being said, I believe this is his Magnum Opus.

0307269752|2.0|Beneath the icy surface of this novel, something is stirring.<br /><br />A mystery.  Yes, a disappearance.  On an island off the coast of Stockholm, accessible only by one bridge, a teenage girl has disappeared.  The man hired to look into this mystery (the Swedish equivalent of Hercule Poirot, perhaps), is Mikael Blomqvist, an investigative financial reporter in his forties, who specializes in exposing sleaze and corruption for a magazine he co-owns with his married lover.<br /><br />The only problem is: this is what they call a \\"cold case.\\"  Harriet Vanger went missing forty years ago, and her great uncle, an elderly industrial magnate called Henrik Vanger, believes she was murdered.  He has obsessed over it for years, and now wants our dashing Blomqvist to find out who did it.<br /><br />So far, so good.  After numerous cups of coffee (which recur throughout the story - I began to worry that Blomqvist was over-caffeinated, as well perhaps as over-sexed), our hero moves into a small house on the island, and begins to methodically sift through old family records, photographs and the like.  He \\"powers up his iBook.\\"  References to computers also pop up regularly; one paragraph begins: \\"Unsurprisingly she set her sights on the best available alternative: the new Apple PowerBook G4/1.0 GHz in an aluminium case with a PowerPC 7451 processor with an AltiVec Velocity Engine...\\"  You get the picture.<br /><br />Blomqvist is unaware that he is being investigated by the eponymous tattooed girl, Lisbeth Salander.  While Blomqvist begins to delve into the murky family history of the Vanger clan (sleeping with one of them en route, for no particular reason), Salander is doing investigative work for a security company.  She is good at finding out people's secrets, and her methods are ruthless; she is a computer hacker - so, more technological references.  Eventually, she crosses paths with our hero and they combine forces.  At times Salander is almost appealing; we are told of her troubled childhood.  Mostly, she hides behind a kind of defensive shield.  Her defenses are only down when she is alone with Blomqvist, who seems to be a magnet for women - one wonders how/why.  Her deepest expression of feeling is: \\"I like having sex with you.\\"<br /><br />It is cold.  Did I mention that already?  The bitter cold of a Swedish winter seeps into the narrative, the stilted conversations, the string of sexual encounters - some of them pleasant enough, others violent and abusive.  As Blomqvist and Salander embark on their pursuit of the missing Harriet, they find corruption and intrigue, bitter family feuds and scandals.  There are plenty of Vangers to get to know.  Many of them still live on the island and come and go at all hours of the night and day.  One is a recluse, the other an ex-Nazi.  One is a \\"firebrand,\\" though we hardly get to know her.  Most of the Vangers hate/avoid/ignore the existence of at least one other member of the clan.  Blomqvist has a tough job ahead of him, and there are many twists that will appeal to the dedicated mystery lover.<br /><br />I confess that I used to love mystery novels, of the old-fashioned kind.  If this is the new breed of mystery novel, then it literally leaves me cold.  About half way through the book I realized I simply did not care A) who killed Harriet Vanger or B) whether Blomqvist and Salander lived happily ever after.  I remain puzzled by the glowing reviews on the sleeve of the hardcover from the likes of Michael Oondatje.<br /><br />I guess I will have to go back to Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.

0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson is truly an acting treasure. This particular film also demonstrates her superb writing skills. So great in fact it won her an oscar. Kate Winslet is demure and refreshing in one of her early performances. I've not been a fan of Hugh Grant but he plays very well here. Beautiful locations beautiful music and beautiful acting make this film another jewel in the crown of Emma Thompson. Highly recommended.

006056251X|5.0|I honestly thought none of the author's novels could approach my reverence and love for the main characters from \\"Dreaming of You.\\" How appropriate then that the daughter of Ivo Jenning (secondary character in \\"Dreaming\\") has a love story as romantic and adorable as Sara's with Derek.<br /><br />When her story began with her propositioning the very man who attempted to abduct her friend, I cheered and settled in for a great read. I knew there had to be more than a wilting Wallflower beneath that stammering, shy facade. And boy did Sebastian find it - along with a sweet demeanor, loving heart, sexual curiosity, and a strength of will rarely seen in recent historical romance heroines.<br /><br />Sure we have a great heroine, but too often readers find her hero isn't worthy of her. Well, have no fear, Sebastian outgrows his dastardly caddish behavior seen in previous books and becomes a man who truly deserves the loyalty and love of this woman. More importantly, he doesn't change from a love-em-and-leave-em type into a decent hard-working monogamous husband just because of Evie, but also because he begins to value everything he took for granted. This is one of the few stories with a hero who truly was a tom-cat (and not the \\"fake rake\\" kind) that promises fidelity that was actually believable.<br /><br />The only minor quibble I had with this story was how utterly detestable her family is with no redeeming qualities. It wasn't necessarily unbelievable, but it definitely required a suspension of disbelief in a few scenes.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|This is my first ever joystick, and I'm pretty happy with it. It's a bit stiff, but could be that it just needs a bit of breaking in. The customizable software is fantastic, letting you program entire sequences of keystrokes into a single button press, and with the \\"shift\\" button, you can virtually double your number of available buttons. My favorite feature is the locking split throttle... the two levers can function independently, or you can lock them together to act as a single throttle. The joystick itself has 4 or 5 adjustments to fit your hand perfectly. And it looks awesome. ;)    My only complaint it a slight dead zone in the center, which requires a bit of cranking before the software acknowledges you're moving the stick. This makes fine adjustments difficult, depending on what game you're playing. But overall, it's a fantastic deal.
1576754227|4.0|Originally, was listening to this book in audio form. Purchased the book because liked it so much and wanted to be able to go through the exercises at the end of each chapter.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|Shooting, driving, and flying its way onto the big screens with what seems to be about a car-trunk full of adrenaline, the twenty-second James Bond film has arrived, though some would consider it only the second in a 007 franchise that is so new and much-improved that it hardly resembles its previous films. It follows two years after \\"Casino Royale\\" jump-started a flagging series with a reimagination of the origins of a British secret agent who is authorized to kill, the clandestine government organization he works for, and the gorgeous women who pass through his action-jammed life.    Given this situation and the fact that a major part of the storyline in this film, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" is a continuation of the previous Bond offering, comparisons between the two, it could be argued, are inevitable. My personal take is that, after that last explosion blows, the last gunshot is heard, and the the dust finally settles, \\"Casino\\" is the better of the two, although \\"Quantum\\" doesn't sit on its laurels either. To the contrary, a case could be made that the action sequences of the latter are a touch too fast, with such extensive use of jittery camera moves, fast editing, and jump cuts that audiences may become confused as to what exactly is happening on screen, who just plunged off the cliff in his car, who's winning or losing. Until, of course, the action ends and the winner stands before our eyes.    Of course, the winner is always Bond, and that's not giving away anything. From the very first installment of the series back in the sixties, if he sometimes loses a battle--which is rare--he always wins the war. Some things may change, but that is a formula which, despite Bond's makeover, does not change. There's still international intrigue, loads of bullets shooting through the air, numerous chase sequences that are improbable but entertaining nonetheless (lots of high-octane chases way-up-high and even more that fly through the air in more ways than one), some huge ballsof explosive fire, and no lack of action in the bedroom, as 007 flies, drives, and boats all across the globe. And, there's an elaborate opening title sequence (designed by Daniel Kleinman) that summarizes it all to the tunes of a song featuring a famous singer (this time around, it's Alicia Keys), all capped off by Monty Norman's famous James Bond theme. In retrospect, all the usual trademarks are there save for one, which I'll let you figure out when you see the film.    As usual, the plot, in its complexity, defies easy summation of its details, save for the simple premise: Bond seeks his own brand of justice for the one woman he had genuine feelings for, Vesper, who was killed in \\"Casino Royale.\\" Could Bond be revealing his softer, more caring side? As played by Daniel Craig in his second go-round as 007, we see a little bit of that--but just a little. He remains largely the tough, rebellious man's man of before, continuing, when he deems it necessary, to upstage his boss, M (the fine-as-always Judi Dench), while trying to foil Dominic Greene, a business man (Mathieu Almaric, great in a bad-guy turn that is both subdued and intense) with evil designs for an extensive patch of Bolivian desert. The exotic woman at the center this time is Greene's former girlfriend, Camille (Olga Kurylenko, attractive in an earthy sort of way) with whom Greene is, one may say, on the outs. After all, trying to kill her has become something of his personal sport. If you think she and Bond wind get together, you're right; she's very much his type: the femme fatale. She plays hard to get at first, but he wins her over. (What did I say before about his always winning?) Thrown in are the exiled General Medrano (Joaquín Cosio) of Bolivia, a former enemy of Bond named Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), and a couple American CIA agents (David Harbour  and the underutilized Jeffrey Wright) who work with Greene in an odd arrangement--or do they?    All of the more memorable scenes are action segments: a high-speed car chase on a highway in the hills, the cars darting in and out of clogged traffic; a chase through buildings and on tiled rooftops in Italy; action jumping between boats in the water; spying, chasing, and fighting during an opera, while remaining unseen; an airborne assault over the mountains; and, toward the end of the film, two explosive fights intercut with one another.    Despite the entertainment value of the hyperkinetic set pieces, I wish the writers (Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade) and director (Marc Forster, stepping in after Martin Campbell's eminently successful direction in the last film) had given Bond a few more chances for us to better glimpse his soul, as was the case in \\"Casino Royale.\\" The basic premise would seem to offer just such a chance to make the character a bit more three-dimensional, but the filmmakers don't seize on it, preferring to focus much more squarely on action, somewhat to the detriment of how much we care about the character.    Nevertheless, it is an engrossingly-juiced-up-enough entertainment with its high-contrast photography (by Roberto Schaefer) and the aforementioned style of editing (Matt Chesse, Richard Pearson), even if the whole thing, while still meeting the high standard of the new and improved Bond, does, in the end, feel just a bit routine. But, I suppose that's just the nature of the franchise, to some extent, a nature that is more apparent without the novelty--and diversion--\\"Casino\\" had as the first Bond film to reinvent its central character as an appropriately muscular strongman, jettisoning the increasingly unbelievable gentility and preposterous gadgets of before in favor of impressive high-concept stunts tempered with no-nonsense body-strength and combat.
0307387178|4.0|I enjoyed this story of Chris McCandless and the path that led him to his tragic wildness adventure in Alaska. This book is much more about his life before the Alaska journey. It is written more as a piece by a reporter who followed up on clues to learn about McCandless's life. It was fascinating but less personal than the movie Into The Wild where we follow Chris through his travels and see him interact with others. While the fictionalized movie might have been more entertaining, one learns more in the book, both about Chris and his family, but also about similar ventures in the past.
B0017APPSO|4.0|THE FILM    This is not to disparage animated films made by studios in the United States, of which there are numerous excellent examples (\\"WALL-E,\\" \\"The Incredibles,\\" \\"Aladdin,\\" \\"Iron Giant,\\" and \\"An American Tail\\" are but a handful of relatively recent titles and, of course, one cannot forget the classic animations from Walt Disney--\\"101 Dalmations,\\" \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Bambi,\\" \\"Pinocchio,\\" \\"Cinderella.\\")    But it seems to this reviewer that, at least over the past couple decades, the animated work from the film industries in other countries--Japan, the UK, France, even Canada--are not only more diverse stylistically than their American brethren but better demonstrate the extensive range of stories to which this technique can be successfully applied. Too often, especially in the modern age, US animated films are limited to visually slick confections with a play-it-safe, family-friendly vibe. It appears that a body of unwritten rules apply to each animated film, none of which would be imposed as strictly on live-action movies. First and foremost, the basic story of each must be based in fantasy and be enjoyable by children--though it's a plus if a few adults at least don't find it boring. Stories that may disturb children or otherwise contain more mature themes are off-limits. Its characters and other contents should be rendered so as to fit a prescribed idea of attractiveness. Its general visual aesthetic, character action, and other movement should be delineated by a smooth gloss and even be somewhat \\"realistic,\\" (no bold abstractions in style)--if that's ever truly possible in animation; it's less possible than one may think even in live-action. (Computer-rendered graphics, it turns out, can serve this need fairly well.) And, if nothing else, it absolutely, positively may not overtly refer to anything political or religious.    It's not that animated movies born of this philosophy are not realized by other nations; they can be. It's simply that animated films that, inat least a few topics, run contrary to this way of thinking are also produced there, and are often well-received by their public. This is obvious in \\"Fantastic Planet,\\" a seventies-era French classic, but also in more recent films like the United Kingdom's \\"Chicken Run\\" and \\"Wallace & Grommit\\"; \\"The Triplets of Belleville\\" from Canada; \\"Metropolis,\\" \\"Paprika,\\" the movies of Hayao Miyazaki, and any number of other Japanese anime. Continuing the tradition of imaginative creativity in foreign-language animation, while telling a poignant story infused by the politics of its setting, is \\"Persepolis,\\" a French film from 2007 written and directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud and based on a pair of Satrapi's graphic novels.    The film, like their books of reference, is Satrapi's autobiographical story, beginning as a young girl (voiced by Gabrielle Lopes) growing up in Iran as part of a decidedly liberal and political family at the start of that nation's revolution in 1978. Idealistic as children often are, she marches around her apartment, proclaiming her support of a new government--\\"Down with the Shah! Down with the Shah!...\\"--until her parents tell her to go to bed. At nights in her bedroom she often speaks to a god who has long appeared in the clouds of her imagination, seeking his advice and reassurance.    Upon learning the news from her father that the old, despised Iranian leadership has been overthrown--a dream held by Satrapi's parents and extended family for many years--this small girl, in some ways, is the most vocal and elated member of that family (although her views at that age are colored by those closest to her). In fact, they, at times, tell her to tone it down. Though it lasts for only a few seconds, the simple sight of Mr Satrapi spinning the little girl around in the air is one of the most memorable in the film. The hopes of a child, her family, and her nation are elevated skyward.    Unfortunately, those hopes are soon quashed as the newregime proves itself to be at least as oppressive as its predecessor. A religious-based fundamentalism, tyranical in its application, unforgiving toward those who openly object to it, quickly grips the nation like a vise. School curricula are modified to those which instill the respect and fear of the state and its leaders into young, impressionable minds. Women and girls are instructed to wear veils. Western culture is condemned. Liberal views--and anyone harboring them--are to be dealt with mercilessly. The Satrapi family is itself touched by the rulers' growing intolerance when young Marji's uncle, too outspoken in this era of oppression, is imprisoned.    But, rather than fear, Marji, as she grows into a rebellious teen (Chiara Mastroianni, who also gives voice to the adult Marjane), cultivates her own particular brand of defiance, not only prefering to shirk the veil, and rejecting the code of conduct imposed on her country by the Shah, but rocking to the sounds of punk and Michael Jackson and Abba. Her experiences finding such music is a commentary that is both humorous and sad.    Her parents, fearing that the situation in Iran has grown too dangerous, especially for their increasingly outspoken daughter, send her to live in Vienna, Austria, if only for her safety. One would expect Satrapi to be more comfortable in the more liberal European society, and in some ways she is, but she also remains largely an outsider to those around her, this time not for her political views, but for the fact that she is Iranian and the two cultures are as different as they are from each other. She becomes friends with a group of free-spirited college students and experiments with the usual substances and lifestyles kids often experiment with. Her older friends think themselves knowlegeable and open-minded, but it's a case where the youth has a more substantial life experience than her elders. She then finds a hopeless infatuation for her blond, wavy-haired Austrian boyfriend--then, she finds a hatred for him that is more hopeless. Other events conspire to unravel her life as she fully comes of age, though considerably earlier than most do. The film never veers from Satrapi's perspective, either as a precocious little girl or as the young woman later in the story, which lends a certain simplicity and focus to the entire story.    The most striking aspect of the picture, of course, is the its notable visual aesthetic. Inspired by its source books, Persepolis and Persepolis 2, the animated images, supervised by Christian Desmares, are rendered almost entirely in bold black and white, with some shades of gray mixed in. Other colors, in the few scenes in which they are used, tend to be somewhat subdued so the general feeling of the film is not disrupted. The color scenes are set during different times in the story and coincide with our protagonist's increasing maturity. The pictures, as they are drawn, are a bit smoother than the graphics in the original novels, though by no means do they look anything like the typical Hollywood animated film of the 2000s. Although some digital work was used to create the animated effects and compositions, computerization does not take center stage. The characters and settings exude a much more hand-drawn feel. Three-dimensional rendering is not attempted here. Instead, distances in these deliberately flat visual concoctions (that is not a criticism) are implied chiefly by the proportions and shapes of objects as they relate to one another. This infuses much of the experience with a certain kind of innocent enchantment, particularly the sections focused on Marji as a young girl.    Just as significant as the visuals, of course, are the people who inhabit that world: Marji's left-leaning and hopeful mother (Catherine Deneuve) and father (Simon Abkarian); her remarkably progressive grandmother (a wonderful Danielle Darrieux) with, for instance, a laissez-faire approach to marriage--old-fashioned she is not; andMarjane's activist Uncle Anoush (François Jerosme). But, at the center of this tumultuous, unforgettable world, is Marjane herself, growing up, growing rebellious, and growing wiser, all in her own distinct way.    The film was easily nominated in its year for the best animated feature Academy Award. It didn't actually win over the typical Hollywood animated movie that took the statue, but, in the eyes of this critic, it most certainly deserved to. A similar situation has happened with other animated films of late. Big money-makers tend to win over smaller, stylistically avant-garde features. Besides the money issue, however, I think Hollywood simply isn't ready to give their most coveted award to a film that is as stylistically alien and thematically mature and candid as \\"Persepolis,\\" and it certainly isn't ready to actually produce them. It may not be for a long while, and that's too bad. I like to imagine that, in the not-too-distant future, the situation may change, that we could eventually see the birth of an animation revolution in the States. Until then, however, I'll have to look to our animated émigrés.      ON THE DISC  This review refers to the Blu-ray disc edition. The features of other available editions may differ.    High-definition 1080p transfers are a particular benefit to movies that use graphic elements extensively, such as this. The drawn lines and textures are sharp and clear, even moreso than they were in theaters. The tones of color and gray are rich and subtle differences can be detected. The sound is as good as can be by today's standards with Dolby TrueHD 5.1 for both the French and English soundtracks. My only complaint about the visuals is that the white subtitles are sometimes a bit difficult to decipher, despite the black outlines. A light shadow effect behind the letters would probably have resolved this.    There are indeed two soundtracks available on the disc. In addition to the original French, the English soundtrack is available. Users can toggle between the two via the menus. The English-language track includes the voices of Mastroianni and Deneuve, reprising the same roles as in the French. Other performers featured in English include Sean Penn, Gena Rowlands, and Iggy Pop. The English version is well-done, though this reviewer tends to prefer the original language version.     \\"The Hidden Side of Persepolis\\" is a half-hour documentary that details the making of the film, from how the two co-directors met and work together, to the philosophy of telling the story using animation as opposed to live-action, to the process of developing the animation. \\"Behind the Scenes of Persepolis,\\" an eight-minute featurette and something of a promotional piece, provides further details about the making of the film. They essentially touch on the basics of the technical aspects of the film. One wishes that the making-of documentary were longer and more detailed, especially considering the lack of a feature-length audio commentary.    The film won the grand jury prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and included on the disc is a Q&A-style press conference held at that festival. It seems somewhat unusual for a nearly-half-hour-long recording of such a conference to be included as a special feature on a disc, but the simple and, albeit, rather dry, session turns out to be rather informative on how the film came to be realized. Included on the panel are the two directors, Satrapi and Paronnaud; the actors Deneuve, Abkarian, and Mastroianni; executive producer Kathleeen Kennedy; and others.    Shedding a little more light on how the visual concepts of the film were created and morphed through their various stages, the animated scene comparisons, which feature commentary by Satrapi, compare the initial storyboard and other drawings to the completed scenes, many of which never made the final cut of the movie. Also included is an animation test, a sliver of a segment that shows a bit of how the filmmakers experimented and refined the animation style. The segment is a fascinating record of the development process.    The disc features audio commentary by directors Satrapi and Paronnaud and actress Mastroanni, though only on three scenes, spanning about six minutes. The comments provide much insight into the filmmakers intentions, enough so that one truly wishes the disc came with the full, feature-length commentary the movie clearly deserves.    Although there are trailers for a number of other films, there is none for \\"Persepolis\\" itself. The trailer as it appeared in theaters, which was influential in convincing audiences to see the film in the first place, would have been a welcome addition to this disc. For some reason, studios leave off the theatrical trailers of recent theatrical releases about as often as they include them. Such omissions are puzzling because seeing how this most-central piece of a film's marketing is handled makes for among the most intriguing of special features, often meriting its own review. Furthermore, given that such trailers usually already exist at the time discs are created, they are easily among the easiest special features to include.    Navigation of the disc is reasonably straightforward, with a good number of chapters, an easy bookmarking system, a timeline-style graphic that pinponts the exact time location of of live viewing and chapters, and an attractive, user-friendly interface, all these features being the norm for Blu-ray discs from Sony. A minor issue is the fact that the top-level menu titles shift their locations when they are selected (the one chosen moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen to left-most position), which is somewhat disconcerting and time-consuming. A larger issue (one that is a less appealing norm of Sony Blu-ray discs) is the fact that the chapters are not given names, which would go a long way toward helping viewers find scenes faster.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood's second directorial endeavor of 2007--the second of the fall season, in fact--\\"Gran Torino,\\" is quite different from the previous movie, \\"Changeling,\\" in a number of ways (unlike in 2006, the last time he had two films in a single season, in which both naturally complemented each other: \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\").    The previous film was set in a 1920s-era Los Angeles that, in its physical appearance, seemed picture-perfect; the current movie uses an aging, gritty, modern-day Detroit as its backdrop. Although he did not appear on-screen in \\"Changeling,\\" he returns as a hero in \\"Torino,\\" albeit an imperfect one. The main protagonists of both films are searching: Angelina Jolie's main mission in \\"Changeling\\" is to find her missing son; actor Eastwood's main goal, though not explicitly stated, is to find redemption for an old guilt that haunts him.    Where Jolie's character, Christine Collins, is shown to be beautiful and virtually flawless, saintly to the point where it almost works against the character and her picture, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, whose racial prejudice and male chauvinism are thinly veiled beneath his weathered skin and often seep through his contemptuous grimace--and his character and his picture are better for this plain honesty, this flaw that, as the film progresses, he finds himself successfully overcoming, though he never makes it an actual goal to do so. It just happens--and convincingly so.    At the start of the movie, Kowalski is an old-time veteran of the Korean war, has just lost his beloved wife and has little left except his dog Daisy, a big, immaculately-maintained--and utterly empty--house and a lifetime of bitterness. The only thing he nurtures, it seems, is his contempt for the Koreans who, over time, have become the dominant majority in his decaying neighborhood, especially those who just moved into the house next door.    The story is also about those Koreans next door, in particular the shy teenage boy Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), who is intelligent and content to do chores around the house he shares with his older sister, Sue (Ahney Her), and their family, such as gardening, washing the dishes and other tasks considered by most others he knows as \\"women's work.\\" That combination of meekness, academic smarts and tidiness give others, in particular his cousin and his brutal gang, a reason, in their own minds, to ridicule Thao as weak and to recruit him into their ranks, which they do repeatedly and aggressively enough that he finally joins them, albeit reluctantly.    His first assignment is one that will inadvertently bring him and his neighbor closer together, though unwittingly. To pass his initiation, he must steal Kowalski's Gran Torino, a vintage 1970s sports car with sleek lines and a cool metal sheen, kept in mint condition by its owner, who seems to love it more than anything, in part because he worked, for many years, on the assembly line that built the model.    After Kowalski's confrontations foil the gang's and assorted other thugs' malevolence directed toward Thao and Sue, he becomes, in Sue's words, \\"a hero to the neighborhood\\" and, before long, he is lavishly bestowed with gifts of food--a custom that arrived with the immigrants to the area--and invited to a huge feast at the Lor's home, attended by their extended family. It's terribly difficult, of course to continue to hate people when they treat one with such kindness, so it is not a surprise that these two cultures of people become something of a family. The majority of the film's middle is about how Kowalski warms to the Lors, gradually learns of Korean culture (mostly by a humorous trial and error), protects Sue and Thao almost as if they were of his own blood, and, in particular, becomes Thao's guide and mentor, with a \\"tough-love\\" approach in an almost surrogate-father relationship. Really, it's about how a man who seemed to have lost the capacity to love, learns to love people again.    The last section, consisting chiefly of a final showdown between Kowalski and the Korean thugs who have set their sights on Thao, is not as interesting as the rest of the story, as we all know that, like good against bad in westerns, it is bound to happen. Nevertheless, it plays out in a way that we may not expect, is suspenseful and caps a film in which much actually happens, not always in terms of action but in human relations.    It is that stylistically simple, unvarnished focus on people and their friendships they find in those they didn't expect that makes this film more personal than some of Eastwood's other directorial offerings--\\"Changeling,\\" for example. There is sincere slice-of-life quality that is by turns dramatic and humorous, though never inappropriately so. It is a compliment that this picture, in its appearance and feel, is simple and rather nuanced, lacking the higher-concept style of most Hollywood movies that deal with similar issues, including many of Eastwood's own. High-tension fights which, in other films, might be allowed a more aesthetically extravagant depiction are, here, more subdued (though there is a scene that may remind some of Eastwood's over-the-top 1970s-era action film \\"The Gauntlet,\\" but only in the vaguest sense). Even the gang members generally look like average people, save for their behavior, and not over-stylized, super-hyper, muscular beasts as some other movies would easily render them.    Vang and Her give capable, if somewhat nondescript, performances as the brother and sister Kowalski takes under his wing, and there is a memorable relationship between the cranky and militant senior citizen and Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), a boyishly young priest ardent on obtaining a confession from his skeptical parishioner, as was his wife's wish, and who questions the old man's methods of handling the trouble imposed by the gangs. But, the stand-out performance is Eastwood's own, frequently portraying Kowalskias old, curmudgeonly and stubborn, yes, but also with that old Eastwood toughness and, when the film calls for it, the pro's charm. Unsurprisingly, most of the memorable lines in the script are reserved for him, yet not all are spoken; many of the best lines are communicated solely through his face and gestures and even an occasional growl. The former Dirty Harry and Man with No Name is the centerpiece, of course, but it would have been nice if the generally well-written screenplay (by Nick Schenk, from a story he co-wrote with Dave Johannson) gave the supporting cast more juicy words to say as well. As it is, in the language department, they are, for the most part, mere bystanders.    Eastwood has long played heroes whose backgrounds, means and even motives can be questioned. Increasingly, though, each of his characters is also, in his own way, vulnerable. In fact, the latter part of his acting career (\\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" \\"Unforgiven\\" and, to a lesser degree, \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\"), has seen him make something of a specialty of playing such people, and his depiction in his latest film fits that category like an weathered shoe fits an old pro.    This film, in some ways a sleeper of the season, has much to say about big issues that affect us all: culture, tolerance, acceptance, redemption. Overall, it says them quite well, in its understated way, handling its issues more credibly than its more flamboyant counterpart from Eastwood this season, \\"Changeling.\\" This, I suppose, is the most important difference of all between the films. Not that you need to see both to enjoy \\"Gran Torino.\\"

6305882592|5.0|THE FILM: 5 Stars    \\"Harold and Maude,\\" a film from the early-1970s which started humbly but grew to become a cult classic from one of Hollywood's golden ages, can be classified as many things: a comedy that runs both dark and light, a romance that is at once offbeat and charming, a satire about society, class, and politics, a cliché-buster about nonconformity, and, finally, a movie that takes any preconceptions you may have and tosses them away.    Directed by Hal Ashby from a screenplay written by Colin Higgins, the focus of the story is a wealthy, quiet, and profoundly morose young man named Harold Chasen (played by turns serious and sincere, deadpan and charmed by Bud Cort, in perhaps his best-remembered performance), who is absorbed with the notion of death--specifically his own. He is so obsessed with it that, when he is not attending the funerals of people he never knew, for his own \\"special sense of satisfaction,\\" he feigns suicide. He pretend-kills or -maims himself numerous times during the film, in fact. So many times that it seems to be, for him, a recreational sport, a bleak hobby of sorts. Rather than the dashing Jaguar he could easily acquire, his preference is for the black hearse, which, as you may have rightly deduced already, he drives to those funerals he is so fond of.    His morbid episodes are rather imaginative (it turns out there are many, many techniques a man can use to harm himself, and Harold, apparently, is a master of most of them, at least as far as dress rehearsals) but, above all, a theatrical spectacle performed especially for an audience of just one: his mother. But, his antics, no matter how showy they may be, are little-appreciated by Mrs Chasen, a fashionable and humorously conceited society lady (relishingly portrayed, with her upper-crust English accent and her metaphorical nose held too high, by the British theater actress Vivian Pickles) who, half the time, is annoyed with her son's devious pleas for attention and, the remainder of the time, hardly registers them in the midst of her need to entertain her well-heeled guests or live her life of entitlement in her sprawling estate. We learn that Harold's behavior stems largely from his mother being too distant. Yet, one senses that seemingly unbridgable gap between them widening with each \\"deadly\\" incident. If all of this sounds too heavy, don't worry. This movie is, without doubt, a comedy; Harold's incidents and the reactions of his mother and her occasional company to them--shocked, irritated, resigned or, simply, preoccupied--are quite funny. And many of them happen abruptly, with no warning, thus surprising the audience as well.    Enter Maude, who, like Harold, enjoys visiting funerals and, indeed, befriends him at one. But, far from sharing Harold's bleak outlook on life, Maude uses them as one more excuse to live life to its fullest. Amidst a crowd of people who mourn in their near-uniform sea of black garments and umbrellas, she stands out, with her yellow umbrella, a small sign of her vivacious, carefree soul.    After they spot each other, their relationship builds relatively slowly. She makes the first moves, taking the trouble to close in on him mid-ceremony, in the church, to offer him, of all things, licorice. They gradually talk more and more. He's rather timid at first but she is so flirtatious and free-spirited that the shy Harold soon begins a slow emergence from his shell. Before long, he's driving her around in his hearse (which she has just stolen--not that it really bothers anyone; everyone has their little quirks, right?), to her home, an old roadside rail car, bursting with plants, music, bric-a-brac, art, scents that smell like snow in New York, and a sculpture Harold finds particularly intriguing as he falls for her, this woman of spontaneity who acts as a counterweight against his feelings of mortality, with those of life. Just as he dwells on death and knows a hundred ways to find it, she finds life and itsinspiration in seemingly everything and every place, some of them unexpected. A greenhouse filled with white dasies that look the same at first glance but, on closer inspection, are each different from the next. A cemetary filled with row upon row of identical white headstones. A scrawny tree clinging to life on the side of a city road--they unearth it and whisk it to the forest, where it can thrive. They find amusement and, thus, life at upstaging Harold's uncle, a military man who was General MacArthur's \\"right-hand man,\\"--and lost his own, with its arm, at some point during his long career. He salutes, when he is so moved, by pulling a string that extends the sleeve of his phantom arm into the air. And, of course, they still partake in more conventional dates. An outing to an amusement park reveals how completely smitten they are with each other. Harold surprises Maude with cake, champaigne, and more on her eightieth birthday.    Oh, did I forget to mention her age? It's actually the detail about Harold and Maude's relationship that most would find unconventional, moreso than the sharp contrast in their respective outlooks on life (and death). At least that's what the film seems to think. Indeed, it is unusual to mainstream Americans, but certainly not unheard of. The history of films and that of many of their makers, not to mention the populace at large, are peppered with similar stories. What truly makes \\"Harold and Maude\\" interesting, fun, and refreshing even after all these years is it takes a seemingly odd arrangement and stretches it to its extreme ends (an age difference that almost couldn't be greater, virtually no inhibitions), more than other films did before and since, without sheepishness or apology. It asserts that people must not have their choice of life partner, a most personal and intimate decision, dictated or judged by society merely to conform to the generally accepted \\"norms\\" or other such rules. Fortunately, it seems that a great deal morepeople have, by and large, accepted this most reasonable of philosophies, though we still have a long way to go.    Harold's older and, in some ways, wiser significant other is marvelously portrayed by Ruth Gordon, the Academy Award-winning actress (\\"Rosemary's Baby\\"), in one of her signature screen roles, and she does anything but \\"act her age.\\" Every so often, for instance, she still models in the nude, with obvious pleasure and an utter lack of hesitation, for her ice-sculptor friend, Glaucus (Cyril Cusack). If only we could all be as uninhibited and full of vigor after eight decades.    Meanwhile, Harold's mother--though I'm inclined to refer to her more formally as Mrs Chasen, so tersely formal, comically self-centered and oblivious to him is she that one almost doubts they are truly related--unaware of her son's exploits with a woman who is old enough to be Mrs Chasen's own mother, does everything she can think of to make him, if not more \\"normal,\\" then, at least, less of an embarrassment to her. She does what, perhaps, most parents would do with their wayward teenaged kids. For starters, she tries the obvious fix and has him see a psychiatrist (a somewhat baffled G. Wood). Stepping up the pressure, she then sends him to his uncle, the aforementioned right-sleeve-saluting General Victor Ball (a boisterous Charles Tyner) of the U.S. Army, into whose ranks Harold is drafted.    But the main endeavor Mrs Chasen pursues to set her boy on what she feels is the proper path to manhood is to arrange a series of blind dates with the intention that he will ultimately marry one of them. The scene in which they answer the computer dating service's questionnaire--rather, she answers it for him--is one of the funniest and memorable in the film. The result is three more or less conventional women (Judy Engles, Shari Summers, and Ellen Geer) who each arrive at the Chasen mansion, in turn, as the film progresses, for a date that is cut too short and ends basically the same asthe others, all to humorous effect, the last date easily the most inspired by Harold's weird nature but, in the end, no match for him. Another character steeped in convention who we meet briefly is the priest (an often shocked Eric Christmas) who gives the sermons at the funerals Harold and Maude attend. Among all the reactions to the news of Harold and Maude's devotion to each other, his is the most hilarious.    The overall feel of the film swings between moody (any of Harold's \\"little eccentric moments,\\" as Mrs Chasen prefers to refer to them) and freewheeling (the title couple's encounters with police officers), but always with a comic sensibility. The director of photography, John Alonzo, helps create mood with the dim spaces and subdued colors of the mansion's interiors, to light-filled scenes with Maude. The film editing by William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka, is frequently imaginative, particularly in the cuts between scenes, such as the cut from Harold practicing his music at Maude's place to him doing the same outside his mansion, or a scene-transition cut that involves Harold opening the doors of his hearse. This type of editing, in its subtle ways, helps drive the continuity of the story.    Beyond that, one of the most clever and effective devices used in the film is the soundtrack, comprised mainly of original songs performed by Cat Stevens. It's not only that the simple yet catchy numbers, accompanied chiefly by piano and guitar, would make a memorable experience all by themselves. It is also the fact that the songs provide something of a window into Harold's mind, clarifying what he feels at particular moments of importance. Ashby, known as a director who uses music to powerful effect (see \\"Being There\\"), also includes a brief rendition of Tchaikovsky's classical \\"Coronation March,\\" used well in relation to this film.    But, overall the tone of the film is chiefly due, of course, to Ashby's masterful direction, Higgins' brilliant screenplay, andthe performances, especially those of Gordon and Cort, at the center of it all. She seems the very definition of free-spiritedness and vitality, as well as the teacher of life. He portrays an old boy who does not realize, at first, how conflicted and lost he is, then proceeds, with the help of a certain young-at-heart lady, to change before our eyes, truly, finally maturing into a young man who irresistably finds life--his life. And that's an experience that we all should find irresistable.      THE DISC: 1-1/2 Stars    This title is one of the numerous examples of outstanding films being slighted by a poor home entertainment release. The disc is characterized by the usual fallacies of such an issue: a too-soft picture quality composed of faded colors; muffled sound that is not as clear as it should be; and no special features, save for a couple of the film's trailers. Not even a commentary. As is generally the case for films originally made with mono sound (like \\"Harold and Maude\\"), the Dolby 5.1 stereo sound adds little to the overall experience. One good feature is the fact that it is designed for the widescreen televisions that have become standard (though that alone surely does not save this disc).    It seems Paramount Pictures, the studio behind both the original theatrical release and the home entertainment prints, was determined to invest as little as possible toward bringing one of its classic films of the seventies to disc. I don't wish to actively begrudge Paramount any more than it deserves. Most of the studios are guilty of the same lackluster treatment for certain movies in their own respective libraries. However, it seems Paramount has done this far more frequently than the others, including to many of its best-known films. One hopes that the studio will use the advent of high-definition (i.e., Blu-ray discs), as a reason to finally give the films in its catalog, including \\"Harold and Maude,\\" a long-awaited home entertainment overhaul, complete withsharp and rich visuals, crystal clear sound, and loads of informative and entertaining special features.    The trailers are amusing. The first one seems to be more of a teaser, chiefly showing a few snippets from the film while Cat Stevens sings the lyrics to what could easily be considered the main theme song to the film: \\"If you want to sing out, sing out / And, if you want to be free, be free / Cause there's a million ways to be / You know that there are...\\" The second trailer gives a better sense of the film's premise, portraying more of the supporting characters and including more dialogue (plus, if you pay close attention, you'll notice a few shots that are not actually in the final film). It also, however, is one of those trailers (and many movies have these) that gives away too much of the story, showing glimpses of virtually all of Harold's \\"suicides\\" and certain situations that, for dramatic purposes, should have been left for audiences to discover themselves.
0132350882|1.0|The book is sparse with information.  The main thesis of the code could be summarized in a simple phrase:  write short functions and use descriptive names.  Like many other books on software style, this author takes his style to the extreme.  His ideal function would contain three or four lines, including the prototype.  Although beneficial in some sense, this would lead to layers upon layers of functions in even the simplest program.  This, in itself, would be a cumbersome and very messy coding style.  To accomodate this coding style, the author suggests abstracting the innards of the code.  While this does indeed make the code LOOK simpler, it's much harder to understand the intent of the programmer since the details (like what the input variables are) are hidden from the function caller.  One must then rely on the descriptive names for all of their information, and if they want to verify that the function is indeed doing what the name states, then they must go diving through many many layers of function calls.  For simple ideas (like making a notepad application), this may be ok, since a function name really could accomodate most of the intent of the function.  But for more complicated routines, like takeTheNormalizedCrossCorrelationBetweenAKernelOfImageAAndASubRegionOfImageB, this idea of capturing the intent in the function's name seems less applicable.    I highly recommend NOT purchasing this book.
B001GCUNVW|4.0|It's official. Mickey Rourke has returned to form with his latest film, \\"The Wrestler.\\" How fitting it is that Rourke plays Randy `The Ram' Robinson, a professional wrestler who is clearly past his prime, sets out to repair (or at least patch up) his long-derailed life and, ultimately, dreams of a shot at a match that could redeem his career. It is as if the picture were made for Rourke and not just because of the basic story. The actor, in what may be the best performance of the year, so completely and realistically embodies his character that it is not only difficult to imagine him portraying anyone else, but easy to forget that the specific character we are watching is not real and the movie is not a documentary.    Of course, this feeling of watching a simple documentary is due largely to Darren Aronofsky's directorial style for this film, which employs an increasingly popular kind of minimalist realism that eschews or subdues many of the elements that tend to give fiction films a more fantastic aura. Perhaps the best example of this style this year was Jonathan Demme's \\"Rachel Getting Married,\\" most of which espouses a style so simplistic in both visuals and sound that it almost feels like a home video. Aronofsky does not go quite that far as he uses music more frequently and the overall experience is somewhat more traditionally cinematic than \\"Rachel.\\" More importantly, \\"The Wrestler\\" is far grittier, with more unforgivingly raw energy and imagery than virtually any quality movie this year or in recent memory. No aspect, it seems, of The Ram's life is hidden from us. Everything is shown with the bare truth in fine detail. His financial woes as he dodges his landlord after failing to pay the rent on his rented trailer home. His pre-match conversations with his competitors as they plan specifically how and when they will abuse each other. His rounds at small, obscure, half-empty community centers and school gyms. A desperate job in a grocery deli he can only tryto make the best of to (maybe) make ends meet. Sitting next to other washed-up wrestlers at meet-greet-and-autograph sessions that no fans attend. Steroid injections jabbed into his rear without flinching. Dreadful, life-altering conversations with doctors.    The movie would be thoroughly engrossing with just those issues, but the story, well-written by Robert Siegel, is also about his relationships with two women in particular, one an unlikely pairing he starts with trepidation on his part, and even more on hers, the other he has lost and tries to re-establish. The first concerns a stripper who is reluctant and mutually insecure about starting anything serious, as neither half exactly qualifies as a pro in the relationship department and both carry their own heavy baggage. The other is with the bitter, college-age daughter he always neglected due to his career-centered life as a wrestler but just as much to his immaturity as a man. Marisa Tomei (late of \\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\\" and \\"In the Bedroom\\") and Evan Rachel Wood (\\"Across the Universe\\") give two of the year's most outstanding performances as, respectively, the sexy but responsible woman wary of starting a partnership potentially filled with incompatibility and pain and the grown daughter who has justifiably lost trust and love in the father who was chronically absent from her childhood. The chemistry between Rourke and each of his on-screen women feels genuine. Like Rourke, each of these two actresses take a character that could otherwise have been flat and typical (the hard-to-get sex object; the neglected daughter) and embodies her with a depth, nuance and soul, much as the movie does with the general story.    The soundtrack by Clint Mansell is appropriately spare, tough and gravelly, including work by Bruce Springsteen, and goes well with the sharp, grainy, no-frills photography provided by Maryse Alberti. This movie is a fine example of how filmmaking technique clearly helps reinforce themessages in the story, in this case how a man who has seen better days in many more ways than one manages to cope in a decidedly unglamorous, hard-scrabble life.    Sports movies have been popular for generations and remain so to this day, though few rise above the conventional contrivances of the genre (i.e., something that hinders the protagonist who then works extra hard to overcome it, ending with tearjerking rah-rah cheerfulness). Much less do they come anywhere near to match the power of this film. Comparisons to the better set of other such movies are inevitable, particularly those whose characters are seriously troubled in fundamental ways. Rocky Balboa spurned an entire franchise that is, at its core, a series of teary-eyed (though some men may object), feel-good movies that state all obstacles, no matter how significant, can be overcome to attain ones goals. \\"Cinderella Man\\" sends essentially the same message in a similar manner. The protagonists of \\"Chariots of Fire\\" seem to have far fewer doubts in their uplifting tale of running. In a less cheerful story, Jake LaMotta's explosive, violent personality in the brilliant \\"Raging Bull\\" ensures many wins in the boxing ring in the first half of the movie, but ultimately undoes his career, family and relationships.    But, proportionally, \\"The Wrestler\\" commits far more of its story to its protagonist's failed afterlife than any of the other movies spend on that of their characters. Even LaMotta's troubles and failures garner relatively less time. While \\"Raging Bull\\" spends a significant amount of time on its character's wins and the other films all culminate with victorious celebrations, the victories of Aronofsky's hero are limited to the fleeting mosaic of newspaper articles, posters and other memorabilia shown in the first few minutes of the film, beneath the opening credits and to Robinson's memories of his long-ago and faded glory days. The ending, climactic but also sad and somewhat ambiguous, is also rather unlike most other sports figure movies which tend to feature clearer, more straightforward resolutions to their characters' issues, a long-standing convention which \\"The Wrestler,\\" to its credit, largely avoids. Remarkable as the previous sports film are--the amazing \\"Raging Bull\\" is a particular favorite--this one feels decidedly more real in tone and style and, in that way, more affecting. Even the depictions of the supporting characters portrayed by Tomei and Wood seem that much more true.    The movie conveys the long-standing belief that wrestling is more a theatrical spectacle casually scripted between players than a true sporting competition of strength and will. The movie does not shy away from the more extreme aspects of the phenomenon. Men pin other men to the ground, while crushing their heads for good measure. Flying behemoths crash-land on their opponents. Sharp-edged props are smashed over heads. Glass shatters and pierces muscle. Skin is lacerated. Blood flows. Stitches are sewn. It is certainly an acquired taste but, then again, so is any other sport, whether it has been featured in film or not. That combined with its stark, authentic-looking, violence and utter lack of sugarcoating may cause some potential viewers to avoid the film but, make no mistake, \\"The Wrestler\\" is a film not to be missed. It's not as much a story about a sport as it is about a life with circumstances many of us can relate to. So, swallow your assumptions and go.

B001LRTT76|4.0|I ordered this from Amazon.ca when it first came out and can say it works fine in US players (both Blu Ray region A) and looks and sounds fantastic.  However, this edition has little in the way of extras.  However, given the price, its not a bad deal.
0756404746|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has written a masterpiece, or at least the first third of a masterpiece, in \\"The Name of the Wind\\". This book is the first part of a projected trilogy, called the Kingkiller Chronicle, and unlike other fantasy authors lately, I believe this to be a true trilogy. From the way the story unfolds, it is obvious that the author has the entire story well planned. It won't be one of those series that keep on growing as the author/publisher sees best seller revenues pile up.<br /><br />The author himself says the story is about the myth of a hero seen from backstage. The protagonist of the novel, Kvothe, (pronounced Qwothe) is essentially telling the story of his life to a chronicler although we do occasionally cut back to snippets of the present. We know he is a hero of some sort at the beginning but how that came to be is a mystery. This novel has everything that makes a fantasy novel (or any novel for that matter) great. It has great characters who we profoundly care about. It has a great, well thought out setting, a complete society that fits together logically. It has a steady pace with highs and lows of action. It has comedic moments as well as tragic moments. It has mystery, particularly with the characters of Dianne and Bast. The protagonist is very intelligent but does make mistakes and must deal with the consequences. We are caught up in the emotions of the characters as they interact with all that happens. And the prose itself...it is written in such a way that is easy to understand and yet is not \\"simple\\"; the words paint the proverbial picture we always look for in a good book. It flows and that, along with the rest of the aspects of this book, makes us want to keep on reading and ignore our bedtime.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss is considered one of the bright new fantasy authors out there and I can easily see why. He resists cliches and even makes fun of them.  Whenever the second book comes out, I will have great difficulty in following my \\"no hardback purchases\\" policy and trying to wait for the paperback. It's that good!ases\\" policy and trying to wait for the paperback. It's that good!
B000T4E29W|4.0|I imported this version from Amazon.de some time ago and can say it plays fine on Region A (US & Canada) players.  While the main movie plays fine (and looks and sounds great given the age of the movie), don't expect the extras work on your US player (as they are not encoded in 1080p).

B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a pleasant surprise and gets a warm welcome on blu ray disc. This is hands down the funniest film of 08 although not for everyone. The comedy is very vulgar and extreme and if you get offended easily then you will not like this film. However, if you can look past that then you are in for a 120 minute joy ride of laughs and more laughs. The acting is stellar for a comedy(Robert Downey Jr anyone), and Ben Stiller's directing is also very top notch. The cinematography is nice to look at and this is a well made film. The story molds together elements of Platoon, Deerhunter, Rambo, and others, and creates one of the wackiest comedies in sometime. I'm usually not a fan of comedy but this is one truly not to be missed. The picture quality is 4.5/5 and sound is 4/5. Plus there are a ton of bonus features that are mostly shot in HD. A must own for blu ray.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie. I love the music, characters. . . everything!!  It's a nice homework break or reward after finals/midterms. I have it memorized.   I would DEFINITELY suggest it. Watch it with a large group of friends. . . over and over and over.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Monica Belluci is one of the most beautiful women on the planet. For that reason this movie is a must own. But be warned as this is a dark and graphic tale of revenge that will haunt you for days, months, even years maybe.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|The first time I viewed Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup (1966), the movie was halfway through and I was utterly confused. Still, I was intrigued by the contrast between the flat black-and-white of the protagonist's photos and the bold colors of his wage-earning fashionista world.  However, upon a second viewing of Blowup this past weekend -- thanks to the invaluable TCM cable channel -- I discovered something new: a wonderful, cruel irony in the action of the main character blowing up his b&ws.  Enlarging his prints to the extent of producing disjointed mor&eacute; patterns, he becomes ever more puzzled by a bizarre mystery that disturbs his jaded life.  It's, like, a totally Hitchcockian experience.<br /><br />In Blowup, it's as though the protagonist played by David Hemmings channels Jimmy Stewart's character from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window:  photojournalist L.B. Jefferies.  He carries out his photographic skills with more pizzazz than Jefferies -- OK, unfair comparison, as the latter was confined to a wheelchair and one window, creating a claustrophobic sensation.  Hemmings' character (unnamed in Blowup) zips around in fresh, open air with and without his Rolls, but his mind is no less captive than Jefferies'.  What the two voyeurs have in common, besides being photographers, is that they're prisoners of their anxiety and boredom.  And their only relief from urban ennui is playing P.I. for the day.<br /><br />Part of the thrill in viewing Blowup, as in Rear Window, is slipping into the uncomfortable position of voyeur and feeling one's accelerating heartbeat provide the score for the suspenseful scenes.  Slightly sadistic, if not masochistic, the viewer partly wishes that these Peeping Toms would trip up and just call the police for goodness sake.  Not only are both L.B. Jefferies and Hemmings' protagonist amateur sleuths with too much time on their hands, but also they have reckless regard for risking their lives.  While Jefferies may receive a pittance of sympathy from those of us who also feel stuck in a room with many views, Blowup's main character engenders despisement because he goes out of his way to look for trouble.<br /><br />In 1954's Rear Window, there's no doubt that Jefferies' predicament -- a risk-taking, world-renowned photographer sidelined by a disability during a hot summer -- ratchets up the suspense to a dizzying dimension.  (In fact, it is only within the realm of romance that \\"Jeff\\" *doesn't* take risks.  I mean, he has no problem jumping in front of a racecar to shoot a picture but refuses to propose to his beauteous, long-suffering girlfriend.  Socialite Lisa Freemont is portrayed by Grace Kelly with equal parts romantic idealism and urbane sensuality. Could the reason be that Lisa is well-heeled and willing to climb the social ladder but not hike up Mount Kilimanjaro with her adventure traveler beau?)  By his own volition Jefferies is out on a limb, his binoculars and cameras serving as extensions of his extremities -- and his ego.  Blowup's main character discovers a decade later than Jefferies that even a magnifying glass is pointless because he's faced with the unknown -- that which cannot be seen but indeed can be intuited. Think of that classic image of the young/old lady: If you stare long and hard enough, you perceive what you want. Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br /><br />As I watched Hemmings' photographer examining certain elements of his \\"blowups,\\" immediately my mind turned to certain scenes in Rear Window where Stewart sees what *could be* evidence of a crime already committed. In both films, however, the viewer isn't privy to the facts of the case and, thus, doesn't know *if* a crime was committed. And in both films, the elements of time and lighting are other, uncredited characters.<br /><br />During my recent viewing of Blowup, I relished in the realm of illusion symbolized by the film's vivid colors and by the use of drugs (including nicotine) as props to reinforce the illusion. Not that I have ever taken an illegal drug in my life, but this second time around watching Blowup gave me the feeling that Antonioni was taking me on an acid-laced journey. The beautiful part, baby, is throughout the film I connected with the metaphysical crisis that Hemmings' antihero experiences as an artist in need of a self-assessment of his worth as an adult human being.<br /><br />After vicariously suffering through his mental defrag while he deconstructs each chunk of a photographed mystery, I thirsted for visual relief. I welcomed Antonioni's mini-masterpieces of distraction, especially the well-edited, living-color orgy sequence that put me in a \\"Crystal Blue Persuasion\\" mood (un-huh). My pupils dilated from mobile colors in the forms of female models tumbling with the main character as he removes their costumes within the contours of purple paper.  Then there's the iconic scene of the photographer trapping a writhing model beneath him while he captures her ecstatic expressions seconds of frame at a time.  Progressive jazz courtesy of Herbie Hancock and his ensemble transform a curt and fleeting mystery lady (played by Vanessa Redgrave) into literally a smoking woman. Remarkably, Redgrave pulls off an optical illusion, recalling Anouk Aimee in her role as the widow, Anne, in another iconic film of 1966:  Un Homme et Une Femme (A Man and A Woman).  Of course, Redgrave's dramatic virtuosity is responsible for evoking the sultry, pouty mod-girl mannerisms that Mme. Aimee displayed so exquisitely in the aforementioned French New Wave film by Claude Lelouch.<br /><br />The most delicious distraction for this voyeur, er, viewer, was one that provided insight into the Blowup protagonist's solitude. It's a moment that magnifies his alienation, his existence that's more stripped-down than mere loneliness.  For him, it occurs outside of his fashion photography sphere. I'm referring, here, to the scene in which he encounters his painter friend, Ron (portrayed by John Castle), copulating with his girlfriend, Patricia (portrayed by Sarah Miles). The photographer's intense gaze locks onto Patricia's rapturous one while she squirms beneath a bright duvet. In a risqu&eacute; scene -- by 1966 standards -- she moans through a climax that could be authentic or fake in keeping with the film's shifting, deceptive sensibilities. It's the one moment in the film where I come close to sympathizing with Hemmings' character because his puppy dog countenance captures the dumbfounded expression of unrequited love.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the absurd subtext of Ron's invisibility within the emotional space created by the photographer and Patricia's adulterous illusion.<br /><br />Blowup is an addictive flick located at the intersection of minimalist thriller and surreal character study. That's this layperson's compliment to the late great Italian filmmaker Michaelangelo Antonioni. In future viewings I'll delight in the film's visual diversions from everyday, black-and-white existential angst. The virtual walk-through in the photographer's duplex alone is a hippie trip from a safe distance.  After nearly a half-century since Blowup's release, it's still not every artist who can afford an interior designer to infuse his or her vain existence with a groovy dose of mad, mod colors.<br /><br />Should Blowup not appear on your cable lineup for months or years to come, you might want to satisfy your desire for a vicarious metaphysical trip -- one with a psychedelic detour -- and get the DVD here on Amazon.com.  Advice from the cool at heart:  Don't dwell on whether there's a theme.

I read it in less than 24 hours and I only put it down because I had to go to school, rehearsal and work. At times the text was a bit repetitive, but overall it was a wonderful read!

B001C4CI8U|5.0|As the title says, BEST EVER. Major kudos to Olivia, Peter and Walter - and the amazing creators of the sci-fi stories. Drama, suspense, at-the-edge technology and, with the latest episode, concepts to blow (and expand) your mind. I will miss them until their April return. I'll just have to watch again the shows to date. I LOVE Olivia - a young Cate Blanchett.
B000IFS0HM|3.0|This is not a happy story, yet it was very well written. Like most Irish authors, he writes with great sincerity. He makes you feel at home in his narrative. Although his family is very dysfunctional, there is a sense of love, warmth and unity that is undeniable. The only thing I didn't really like about this story was his resignation to their life of debauchery and deprivation. His attitude was:\\"This is the way we are and we are not going to change. Deal with it.\\" This is not a positive attitude. He never showed any hope for a positive change in his life, and it didn't end with a lot of hope for the future. I think this story was a little overrated.

0525478183|4.0|I've read both \\"Looking For Alaska\\" and \\"Abundance of Katherines\\" by John Green, mainly the reason why I got this book in the first place. It has simlarities to the first books, writing styles, view points from characters etc... but there is a more realistic image of all characters in this book. It's not just a happy ending. This book should be a favourite, because unlike so many other books that get shoved into the teen fiction category, the characters have layers, interesting points that make them all different without being stereotypical. I enjoyed \\"Paper Towns\\" because as I reader I was treated as an intelligent person as opposed to a self absorbed teenager.
0312944926|1.0|This book brings back bad memories of the movie \\"Twister\\" - when a motorized vehicle crashes in the front door and then out the back door of a house as it tumbles across the road. I have never read a book that was more ridiculous and yet, at the same time -- more entertaining. My husband and I laughed hysterically for hours reminiscing about one absurd episode after another. From the boyfriend who hangs by his fingertips from a window sill in a cathedral tower before climbing back inside to escape the mercenary killer that he trips down the stairs and over his head with a candlestick to a taxi and a Vespa that spin in circles in a pool of oil, crash through the wall of an airplane hanger and just keep-on-going. Oh gawd - my sides are aching. Someone really ought to make a fortune on an \\"Airplane\\"-like movie version of this ludicrous novel.
0843178086|4.0|My 23 months old likes this book a lot, but it's not one of her favorates. I guess she likes it because this book was small and different than her other books.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have grown to love this movie! I initially gave it 3 stars because I felt it was too long and a bit boring. A year later I watched it again and I liked it better than the first time. A year after that and I love it. I have watched it so many times now that even though I have the DVD I watch it on cable when its on.     The cinematography is fantastic, as is the costuming. The actors are not just amazing to look at they really embody the characters.     If you didn't like it the first time, try watching it again after a time...your opinion may change as mine did!
B000VAQX0A|5.0|The MFSL version of Permanent Waves smokes the latest remaster by Mercury. This was desperately needed since the Mercury remaster was flat. MFSL's version isn't as muddy, as it has more punch and transparency.<br /><br />On a negative note: When I buy music, it's a lifetime investment, so I don't care for the cardboard gatefolds that Mobile Fidelity has moved to. They will wear over time, where if they used jewel cases, I could simply replace the scuffed and scratched jewel case.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|Ok this movie is not as good as SpiderMan 1 or X1 or X2...however its as good as SpiderMan 2 (at least it doesn't have some cheesy horrible dance scene in the middle of the movie) and better than X3, SpiderMan 3 and Ghost Rider by far!    I think this movie is more in line with Frank Miller's take on the character (which obviously a lot of reviewers either never read or don't remember) thats why its so dark and may remind some people of Batman (another character Miller took on).     The BluRay transfer is a good one and I like the Directors Cut (though I also did like the original version as well).  My only complaint is that we don't get to see Elektra in action that much. I think they really didn't do as much with her character as they should have which is why for some, her death didn't do much for them. I have always loved the character so of course I still felt bad because I didn't want to see her die after doing so little in the movie.     This is an enjoyable comic adaption, not the best, but not the worse either.

B00006G8K0|5.0|One of the top ten Horror movies of all time is this 1958 classic that revolutionized the genre.    Changing the plot drastically from Stoker's novel and the early Lugosi version,the result is a lightning paced film that is pure,gothic excellence.  All the performances are very well constructed and delivered to add to the film considerably,but the leads create two of the most memorable ever seen in the genre.  Christopher Lee is a truly frightening Count Dracula,more animalistic and imposing than earlier portrayals with an emphasis on sexuality.  Peter Cushing delivers the defintive portrayal of Dracula's arch nemesis,Van Helsing,proving more than a match for the bloodthirsty Count,even engaging in hand to hand combat at one point!  The use of Gore and the emphasis on sex gives the story a more visceral punch that the earlier adaptions lacked and makes for a more powerful experience,that few of it's imitators will understand how to meld as well.  The film's ending is justifiably one of the greatest in film history accompanied and accentuated by the wonderfully,bombastic score by James Bernard.    This is also probally the best film of Horror and Hammer director,Terence Fisher,who creates a wonderfully gothic Technicolor classic.    The only unfortunate thing is the DVD does not do the film justice,offering a so-so Letterbox print of the film and being almost a bare bones release with nothing of interest to the fan.Hopefully,Warners will release a better DVD of this cinema essential in the future.
B001PR0XYA|5.0|This was an entertaining spin on the Beowulf story. It had mostly everything the original Beowulf story had but added new twists to the storyline. It was very entertaining and was pretty intelligent as most action stories go. Very good CGI to carry off the special effects and some good actors to carry the plot.<br /><br />It wasn't mindless or formulaic as most other action movie plots. I actually enjoyed watching it and found it interesting. I would recommend it on a dreary, rainy day when there are no ball games to watch. Enjoy!
B001GM28HO|5.0|First CD where I like every song on the album, I even have a few as my ringtones. I usually don't even buy cd's but I had to have this one and I love it!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD did not disappoint!  I LOVE it!  All the songs had a great beat to them and related to the movie.  If you love rock and roll, turn up the volume to the first four songs!  It'll make your day.  I loved the lyrics to Rob's song - the words are so profound and beautiful, just like Edward.  I highly recommend this CD to all Twilight fans!
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|With the exception of one song, this cd is entirely in English. Irish is a beautiful language when sung, but listeners really don't get to hear that. Rather, they get poor remixes of previous work. Save your money and your ears for something better.
B000006IUQ|2.0|The movie has some sound problems at the beginning, which disappear somewhere after that... but, it does have sound problems.
031606792X|5.0|WOW... this is a great ending to a creative story....  Loved to read it!
0440241901|3.0|Having read the Shopaholic series in a matter of days, I was looking forward to Kinsella's latest. It's as readable and fun as her previous three, but there isn't much else there. She seems to have only one voice for her main character, making Becky Bloomwood practically interchangeable with this new heroine, Emma Corrigan. Emma doesn't shop as much, but they're a similar type: average girls, of average intelligence, who nevertheless possess a certain \\"something,\\" in both cases a refreshing honesty that their multimillionaire leading men find irresistible. They both think their men have duped them, but in the end true love does conquer all. Which is just fine sometimes. I wouldn't want to read something like this every day, just as I wouldn't really want to eat nothing but chocolate for the rest of my life. Basically, disposable fiction at its charming, British best.
0307269752|4.0|I loved everything about this book, but the ending was a little unsatisfying.  The delivery was quick and painless!
044024238X|3.0|I liked this one better than Can You Keep a Secret? which just seemed too derivative of the Shopaholic books. I guess the real explanation is that Kinsella has a formula that can be boiled down to \\"girl gets boy\\". It's still a chick-lit fantasy, so don't expect anything too deep. Might be a good book group book since you could hash out the reasons she makes certain decisions.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The PS2 Memory Card is an essential for anyone who uses the PS2 system and saves their games in-progress. Even though I could have purchased it in-store, the price would have been much higher. If you can wait a couple of days for the item, it is absolutely worth it because in the end you get the same product and save money.
0743454537|3.0|This is the first Picoult novel I've read, and I must say I was quite impressed with it. I don't want to give too much away, but the action centers around a young girl whose older sister is dying of a rare form of leukemia, APL. It turns out that the girl, Anna, was created specifically to help her sister live. Since her birth, her parents and doctors have \\"farmed\\" Anna for parts for Kate. Anna has never known herself except in the shadow of her sister's illness, and now, at 13, she's decided to sue for medical emancipation, so she can make her own decisions. She is on the brink of being \\"forced\\" to donate a kidney to Kate, an operation that Kate's doctors are divided on, since her body has undergone so much already. There is a subplot involving Anna's lawyer, Campbell and her gaurdian ad litem, Julia, as well as another featuring her even more igorned and misunderstood juvenile deliquent brother, Jesse. However, it is the glimpses into her parents' minds, Brian, a firefighter, and Sara, a former lawyer and full-time mother, that offer the most insight into the family, and are the most poignant, because you see the inner worlds of two people struggling to choose between their children, all the while telling themselves they're not. By allowing us to see what they go through as Anna struggles for an identity of her own, Picoult keeps the story from being one-sided and easily dissmissed, instead creating a truly absorbing story that gets under your skin from the first page.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  A little dark for the averager viewer, but for Batman enthusiasts this movie is a must have. It's hard to believe I've owned this movie for over 10 years. Where has the time gone?!?! I can't even begin to count how many dozens of times I have watched this movie. I enjoyed it in the theater when it was first released and I'm still enjoying it on a very regular basis all these years later.<br /><br />I own pretty much every Batman movie ever made and this Dark Knight series with Christian Bale is by far my favorite. I think it's time for another Dark Knight movie marathon this weekend. Bring on the popcorn!
0060005696|4.0|I took about 9 pages of notes on this book... Schwartz has some interesting things to say about our culture, and how we can often become crippled by too much choice. He manages to be pretty well-balanced, though, and never sounds preachy or bitter. He loves our society, he just realizes that so much freedom is a big responsibility and often difficult to deal with. More than just an academic study, but not entirely a self-help book, he does offer some workable tips on how to overcome being overwhelmed by choice. Definitely a recommended read.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|ok, this movie is flat out awesome, i don't think it got the respect it deserved in the theater.  I would say this is the Matrix mixed with an assassin movie.  Very well made and acted.  Get it on bluray, it's amazing

0061139378|5.0|Coraline by Neil Gaiman (Harper Collins Publishers, 2002) is a Supernatural Fiction, estimated to be a 5th grade reading level by the Fry's Readability Formula.  However, it is aimed at 6th to 8th graders.  Coraline is about a young girl moving with her parents into an old house divided up into apartments.  She's unhappy about her parents' inability to spend time with her due to a new work project.  Coraline begins to pass time exploring and meeting her quirky new neighbors.  One day, Coraline discovers a locked door which her mother reveals opens to a brick wall.  Her mother tells her that the other side of the wall is an unoccupied apartment.  Fascinated by this door, Coraline returns by herself another day with the key.  This time when she opens the door, it opens to a dark corridor which Coraline follows to an apartment that is the mirror image of her own.  Life seems better on this side of the door, everyone is nicer, her room is prettier, people pronounce her name properly and there is gourmet cooking for dinner.  Coraline explores further, and finds strange analogues to her own world.  There she meets a person that looks much like her mother, except for her long sharp fingernails and black button eyes.  She tells Coraline that she's her \\"other mother\\", and Coraline may stay in this world forever. The \\"other mother\\" leads Coraline into the kitchen, telling her she must complete one task before they can be a family.  She shows Coraline a needle and thread and two buttons, which she wants to sew over Coraline's eyes.    Frightened, Coraline escapes through the corridor to her true home and discovers her parents are missing.  Coraline finds them trapped inside a mirror, imprisoned by the other mother.  Coraline decides she will have to return through the corridor and outsmart her other mother to win her parents back.  Upon her return to the \\"other mother's\\" home, Coraline is locked in a closet where she meets the ghosts of children the \\"other mother\\" has \\"loved\\"in the past, and realizes her future if she doesn't escape and defeat her \\"other mother\\".  As an adult, I even found this book to be an engaging story proving to readers that even though the grass may appear greener on the other side, upon closer examination that often is not the case.  One aspect of the book which parents may view as negative is the horror aspect of the book, including a disembodied hand, which may prove to be too much for more sensitive children.  However, the ultimate theme of the importance of love and family prevails.  Another issue is that the novel is short, 162 pages including illustrations.  I felt that Gaiman could have elaborated the story further in certain areas, thus further developing the characters and their motives.
B000MG1ZFQ|1.0|The title cut on this CD would not play. Returned the CD for a replacement but that was the same, the title cut wouldn't play. Returned that one too and gave up on getting the CD.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I'm listening to this album right now as I am typing this review. I first bought the \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" album, which is very outstanding. I saw they had a previous album \\"30 Seconds to Mars,\\" I had to buy it. This album is really good.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much as did my adult children and toddler grandchildren.  There's something for everyone!
0060558121|5.0|Amazing thought of the life of any person whom believes that the original gods are still out there and how intense Gaiman leads to places so into oblivion that you cant put it down. I usually look for the unusual in novels and i think the writer has hit gold or what anyone believes to be their pot of gold. All with an open mind should read this novel.
B000UG4LYU|5.0|I wasn't sure how to title this review so I went with what seems like the most obvious title to me.  Although this was released in 1993 it sounds like it could have been cut today.  It's that progressive.  This isn't the cd for everyone.  This is more of an experimental Bowie and in that regard it stands out as a must have - if you liked any of the Berlin period stuff or Heathen.
B00006AW2M|5.0|Just the controversial nature alone that this CD has always produced should be enough to entice a collector to listen to this body of work. It is clear from track 1 that the Stones are attempting to produce music that they are not comfortable with. But that is precisely the genius of this CD: they did it and, given the competition at that time, they did it extremely well!! It is indeed unfortunate that the events following this CD's release caused them to abandon further experimentation into psychedelia; for if this CD is any indication, they would certainly have become masters in this genre in very short order.
0743297334|1.0|I cannot fathom how people praise this book.  I can sort of understand that in 1926 almost all Americans had never been to or seen Spain and maybe were fascinated by the accounts of the running of the bulls in Pamplona.    Other than that, this book is terrible.  Boring descriptions of how much people drank and what they ate.  As another reviewer put it, \\"If you took out the descriptions of drinking, eating, hotels, and the towns you're left with perhaps 50 pages.    Hemmingway does this in A Farewell to Arms also, but at least that book is interesting.  This book is just downright boring.    I guess anyone can win a Nobel prize in literature.
0061689246|1.0|Reads like a book for 12 year olds. Too dumbed down for adults- even those of us to like Harry Potter books.
B000001ESJ|5.0|A Farewell To Kings is Rush in their purest form.  This album has it all.  Great guitar, great keyboards, great synthesizers, great percussion, and great vocals.  The album's songs also vary in subject matter.  Everything from the end of kings, to a tropical paradise, to a semi-ballad, to a sinister sounding space song.  Short songs and long songs.  There are only six songs on the album, but all are great.  The best three songs in my opinion are Xanadu, Cinderalla Man, and Cygnus X-1.  Xanadu is epic length, full of keyboards and synthesizers.  Great sound effects and awesome percussion by Neil Peart.  I saw Rush play this live in 1994 and was blown away.  During that same concert Rush teased the crowd a little by playing a brief part of Cygnus X-1, Geddy Lee's bass line near the beginning of the song.  Cygnus X-1 is a song that has everything.  It is actually quite scary sounding.  Combine Lee's high pitched vocals with heavy guitar mixed with keys, synths, sound effects, Neil Peart's masterful drumming and Lee's familiar classic bass line at the beginning of the song, and you've got one terrifying sounding song.  It is one of my favorite Rush songs ever.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  If you want to hear Rush in their purest form and arguably their finest hour, get this album.
006016848X|1.0|The book did not by any means meet my expectation.  My boyfriend mentioned an extract from the book during one of our conversation and I thought it would be something spectacular in terms of learning new things.........but i was thoroughly disappointed.  Very bland!!!!
0312370849|4.0|Although the author stated that it is not a history/non-fiction book, the story is a reminder that the past lingers not to be forgotten. This book is a simple page-turner and a fast read.
B00000BKDX|5.0|Here we've got a performance that consists of Iron Maiden's first album up to Powerslave - what people consider the \\"classic\\" era. And boy, if you haven't SEEN a Maiden show, here's something that's pretty close to how amazing it is. Great production, songs sound amazing live! Guitars, drums, bass, and godly vocals all there - key Iron Maiden.     If you like Iron Maiden you owe it to yourself to check out \\"Live After Death\\" as it features their classic material that fans go nuts for. There's a DVD out for this now that I still need to check out! But here's a hint of how Maiden is live. These guys are Gods - UP THE IRONS!
B000URDEB0|5.0|Interesting a lot of the fans of this band are unhappy with the new vocalist Annette Olzon. I have always admired this band, as they become one of the great alternatives to listening to grunge and syrup pop in the 90's. The only problem I ever really had with Nightwish was Tarja's over the top theatrics. Now, each to their own, but I think Annette adds an ethereal, Celtic tone to the bombast that is Nightwish's trademark sound. I believe this to be their second masterpiece, along with Once. The two albums are like chalk and cheese, with Once being the heavier, and Dark Passion Play being commercial and more accessible to a wider audience. And that can be where the problem lies. It seems 'true' fans of many bands don't like to see them become 'mainstream' (Dragonforce springs to mind). Some reviewers here are probably correct to a point, as Annette's voice could be well utilised in any number of Eurobeat/ Trance acts, it does have that sort of pop dynamic. But she does have range, she has an ear for melody, and most importantly, offers a new direction for a band that faced the possibility of stagnation.
0316017922|5.0|\\"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?\\" answer, \\"Practice practice practice\\" is more than an old joke.  After reading Gladwell's book, Outliers, many myths of innate ability can be put to rest . . . turns out much more is in your control, and some is not!
