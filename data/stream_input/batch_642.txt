B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The DVD is packed with special features, basically anything you wanted to know about the making of the film and the history behind it.  The movie is a flawless transfer, with special effects that will stand the test of time.   <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this film in the theatre, you have my pity, but the film is just as gripping on dvd.  It screams loudly \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their government.  The government should be afraid of its people\\".
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|If you love this movie, you must buy this beautiful director's cut.
B00005JL0I|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever purchased.  I quit watching the first time I watched.  I tried one more time and forced myself to keep watching thinking that it had to get better.  I still could not finish the movie.  e-bay or Good Will will get this.  A donation is best as this movie is not woth the time and energy to post on E-bay

1401308201|5.0|Everything arrived exactly perfect, and helped make the best birthday gift my girlfriend ever received.  THANKS!
B000I5X81K|2.0|After waiting a very long time for this release, and having great expectations over the music which would be represented, I found it to be a disappointment.  Too many varieties of music on one CD - it didn't flow and frankly, I'm not even listening to it now.  My friends also felt it wasn't as good as previous work - too mixed up - and too many high notes.  Sorry to say this as he's a tremendous talent.
B000003N7Y|5.0|Just a fine collection of work by the best jazz bass player ever.
0395389496|5.0|I read this book (and was read this book) many times as a child.  I recently purchased a copy for my nephew to enjoy.  It's a great way to open the imagination and believe in the unbelievable - even today.
0307237699|5.0|I had known only briefly about Mr. Obama.  This book reveals a clear analysis of him, at least from his viewpoint. He seems to be a deeply thoughtful and analytical about problems facing our country.  I like his basing his thoughts on a positive note - hope.  And it isn't just 'pollyanna' or 'Orphan Annie' hope.  He exams problems with serious purpose and depth and still holds out hope.  We need more of that kind of pragmatism.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|If you have seen the first two x-men movies, then this x-men movie is a must-see. It keeps you entertained the entire time by taking you through dramatic turns of certain characters that you are already familiar with in the first two x-men movies. The third movie is just as good as the other two and will not let you down. The plot of the movie is outstanding, there are new mutants, the humor still remains and the movie does have its dramatic moments. The only reason why I gave the movie 4 stars is because of the very end of the movie. But I do not wish to spoil the movie so I will leave it to the buyer to watch!
0789723107|4.0|Good detail for the beginner. I have utilized the suggestions and have seen results.
0823016285|5.0|Most of the books on drawing the human head rely on classical knowledge about proportions and features that was passed on since the greek masters.  This book complements this knowledge with very thorough and insightful information about emotions and their effect on the human expression.  Not all portraitees keep a neutral expression on their faces during a session, especially children. Now I am much more confident when facing such tasks!
B000002AP1|3.0|I heard \\"I Need Somebody\\" and gave this a try. I don't dig the \\"in the red\\" sound they were going for. To be honest, I don't like most of the songs either. We can all appreciate their influence on what we jam too now, but I just couldn't get into this one. Much respect, no rotation.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The second season starts out slow in terms of new things happening. There are quite a few episodes where character development and background information seems to be the main emphasis while the actual plot is put on hold. In my opinion tough, this slow buildup pays off in the more speedy episodes (especially the last few episodes) by giving the audience an experience unrivaled by any other TV series.
0399226907|5.0|My kids love to turn all the pages, the illustrations are well done.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson, for Christmas. He was very pleased.
6305907145|5.0|The storyline was brilliant and the acting and choice of actors were very well chosen.  By watching the movie with the director's commentary later, I learned that the director took parts of Jayne Austin's writings to put into the movie during certain scenes, and also included a real life situation that happened to Jane personally. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was a brief shot of nudity, which wasn't needed to establish the scene.  Other than that it seems the best version of \\"Mansfield Park\\" ever done.  I loved it and would watch it over and over again!!!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Of course, it seems silly (and greedy) at first thought-- a re-mastering, rehashing, and re-releasing of the Beatles' best work. <br /> <br />At best, most people already own the originals.  At worst, this might have been simply a tacky and needless exercise in revisionism.  We've seen that done before, eh?  The re-master of Yellow Submarine, the Beatles Anthology -- these are sets many of us could have done without. <br /> <br />But this is different.  The re-work is a piece of craftsmanship in and of itself, as one might only expect from Sir George Martin and company.  The clarity of the Beatles best work is actually enhanced in these crisp recordings with remarkable sound quality.  Interesting new arrangments complement the original work nicely.  Bravo! <br /> <br />

B000GW8RX4|5.0|Who was Rainbow and are they any good? <br />Rainbow was birthed out of famed guitarist Ritchie Blackmore's departure from supergroup DEEP PURPLE.His impression of lead vocalist,Ronnie James Dio's group( ELF who was opening up for DEEP PURPLE), led to his proposition into forming RAINBOW.This group,RAINBOW, established DIO as the premier heavy metal vocalist that would later define metal as we know it.It would prove to be part of DIO's path of successful stepping stones before joining BLACK SABBATH prior to his own highly successful solo career in the 1980's. <br />The 1970's:There wasn't the sound equipment available that we have today nor did the avereage individual have the means to play any form of music videos.So when it was filmed,it was never intended for a professional release.Thankfully,it was filmed and it is great! <br />This is an era that wasn't about all the show,,, IT'S ABOUT THE MUSIC ! <br />It sounds as good as the records did from that era and with an opened mind you will see that this is a true gem to be relished. <br />HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DID ! ! !

055358202X|2.0|Where is Tyrion? Where is Bran? Jon? Sansa? Daenerys? Stannis? So many of the characters I had come to love-hate? Instead, we are left with the ugly and stupid Cersei, the ugly and stupid Brienne, the ugly and stupid Ironmen. I loved the preceding books in this series, in large part because of the brilliant characters of Tyrion and Arya. But not only has the author abandoned (not killed, merely not mentioned) so many of the characters he built up, his story has veered off in other directions, and begun meandering about. I fear this series is going the way of Robert Jordan's promising but ultimately awful Wheel of Time series -- endless side-steps ploddingly placed, with innumerable new characters who are really only variations on characters we've already seen. Let's hope this book is an aberration in the series, and the next brings a return to form. Martin can write, and has the ability to create memorable characters and episodes, but to coin a cliche, he seems to have lost the plot as well as his characters.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|This is an excellent CD from Muse. The songs are excellent and the DVD is really fun. Such great energy to see these guys live and the DVD really captures that.

B00005JNS0|5.0|This was a great movie.  I even had my 76 year old father watching it with me.  If you like cars, comedies, or animation, it has something for everyone.  Great humor and a good story.  I highly recommend everyone watch this movie.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I got this for my Father and he absolutely loves it.  He listens to it all the time.  I wish I had gotten a copy of it for myself!
B00005JPDP|5.0|As the title suggests, \\"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\" is a pure sensory experience, enveloping the audience into a seemingly unending and unconquerable world of scents. It was absolutely amazing that the filmmakers managed to immerse us in such a rich and varied realm: we're incapable of actually smelling the images as they appear on the screen. Nonetheless, we're able to understand what we're being asked to experience along with the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), who was born with an inhumanly strong sense of smell. As he wanders the streets of eighteenth-century France, his nose acts like a filing cabinet, collecting countless numbers of odors and storing them in his memory. Everything emitting a scent is shown to us through some clever camera angles, most of which are extreme close-ups of objects and bodies moving in slow motion.    This first-hand look into Grenouille's world made for quite a unique experience, especially since we're being asked to address a sense that's quite useless for film watching. But his obsessive and ultimately murderous drive to capture the perfect scent enables us to transcend that handicap; even if we can't smell what he smells, various shots enable us to understand that he finds the scents of the world intoxicating. We also gain understanding with the help of John Hurt, the film's narrator. He's quite an important character, considering Grenouille is a young man of very few words. According to some background information, he didn't learn to speak for many years. He was unceremoniously born underneath a foul-smelling fish cart in Paris, the fifth child of a woman whose previous four children were stillborn.     After she's arrested and executed for willful neglect, the infant is sent to an orphanage, and there he remains throughout his entire childhood. It's established almost immediately how unnerved the other children are around the now named Grenouille; he cannot speak, yet he develops a peculiar senseof smell, one that makes him perceptive to everyone around him. This marks the first in a series of plot devices that almost come off as supernatural, a quality that, if not viewed in the right frame of mind, may come off as completely ridiculous. There are a number of moments in this film that require suspension of disbelief. This is especially true of the final major sequence, in which a spur of the moment orgy takes place in the town square.    This isn't to say that they detract from the effectiveness of the story. If anything, they enhance it. Keep in mind that Grenouille is a unique individual; not only is his sense of smell incredibly powerful, he also has no scent of his own. He doesn't learn this until he's older, at which point he's already been sold as cheap labor to a tannery owner.     But this is when things take a much darker turn, and they only get darker as the film progresses. After years of remaining behind the confining walls of the tannery, Grenouille is finally asked to assist in making deliveries. At last, he has the chance to take in the various odors of the city, all of which he has yet to distinguish as bad or good. Then he gets a whiff of a young girl selling yellow plums, and the seduction is complete. He's not interested in buying any of her fruit; he only wants to bask in her heavenly aroma. Unfortunately, restraining her and choking her to death brings him no closer to capturing her scent. He then understands his purpose in life; he shall find the world's most enticing smells, collect them, and make them into a one-of-a-kind perfume.    And as luck would have it, he makes a delivery to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), an Italian perfumer. At one time, he was well respected and his shop was always full of customers. Now it seems as if he's past his prime, his attempts at creating the next great perfume being thwarted by rival businesses. But then he meets Grenouille, whose powerful nose allows him to pick out exactly the right scentsand mix them in exactly the right amounts. Finally, he's found someone who can put him back in business. In becoming an amateur perfumer, Grenouille hopes to learn the fine art of capturing scents.    Unfortunately, Baldini is only familiar with one capturing method: distilling various flora and fauna by boiling them in water. Grenouille's pursuits are far too grand for this method, and it shows through his unsuccessful attempts at distilling the essences of glass, various metals, and Baldini's cat (supposedly for the sake of experimentation). His only other option is a method used in Grasse, a city known for producing the highest quality perfumes: it involves animal fat, which can easily absorb scents. After the fat has been slathered onto flower petals, it is then scraped away, mixed with alcohol, and distilled into concentrated oil. Grenouille immediately leaves for Grasse, knowing that this method will serve his purpose.    At this point, his obsession turns deadly; he kills a number of young girls, capturing their scents by slathering their naked bodies with animal fat, scraping it off, and boiling it with alcohol. I remember how uncomfortable I felt watching the fat sizzling in glass beakers; we're essentially witnessing a madman bottling youth, beauty, and innocence, all of which were previously impossible to collect. The very thought of someone being both skilled and heartless is not exactly pleasant, especially since he needs one more victim to perfect his perfume. Here enters Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), a young virgin who lives with her loving father, Antoine (Alan Rickman). Capturing her scent won't be so easy; Grenouille's murder spree has definitely gotten the city's attention.    Such a fascinatingly dark story was enough to get my attention, as well; despite disturbing visuals and heavy-handed subject matter, \\"Perfume\\" is not easily dismissible. I watched it with grim focus, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the next turn of events. I don't know if I'm helping the film or hurting it by saying that they lead to a particularly odd ending; while I consider it appropriate, some my find it nonsensical and in poor taste. But you have to keep in mind that a supernatural story is being told. It may not seem that way at first; initial appearances make it seem like a straightforward period piece. But as soon as the infant Grenouille inhales the scent of an orphan boy's index finger, it becomes obvious that extraordinary things will happen. A lot of credit has to be given to such a film, especially one in which the everyday sense of smell is successfully woven into the narrative fabric.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|The Perfect Gift for my college freshman.  After he and his friends stopped laughing he brought it home for Christman break,so my wife and I could laugh at its irreverence.

B00005JNS0|4.0|My husband the car nut grinned through the whole movie.  The clever animation that transformed \\"vehicles\\" into people was delightful.  The voices of Paul Newman and Owen Wilson were perfect for their roles.  Pair this movie with \\"Talledaga Nights\\" and you have THE 'motor head' evening.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This was a very good copy  or reproduction. I was as good or even better than the original I saw many years ago.
B000007XUQ|3.0|Although I liked the CD in general, I thought there were too many instrumentals included, when what I was really looking for was a collection of Christmas songs with Karen's beautiful voice!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What a great gift for anyone who likes musicals.  This Christmas gift was well received by the person getting the gift, and me.  Shipping was only a matter of days.  Thanks.

B000007XUQ|1.0|i have wanted a carpenters christmas album for 3 years now and finally got it for christmas this year as a gift.  it was a gigantic dissapointment!  i did not want all the other music in there with it i just wanted the Carpenters!  i did not review the cd on line to see what it involved but someone else bought it for me!  anyway HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!  great songs but like i said I just wanted the carpenters!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Very well put together album.  The music flows nicely and her sound is an R&B and jazz blend.  Recommend strongly.
B000002RXS|5.0|Of the many recordings of Carmen that I've owned, this is the best.  Callas has the perfect voice for it.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|A fantastic blend of old time rock with smooth jazz. Also throw in a little hot blues.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|both actors are so gorgeous in their roles...you fall in love with them straight away! diane lane is fabulous! the story is great...I saw this on the plane and just HAD to have a copy! loved it to bits! John Cusack is always fantastic...alot of wit and great humour...
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Interesting to follow John Mayer's evolution.  Not his best release, but still very entertaining.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is the best ever Disney movie...the music is fantastic with a beautiful and simple story that has been redone for kids...I grew up loving this and still do!! I bought this firstly on VHS years ago...and the colour is fading cos i've watched it so many times! <br /> <br />One thing - i'm not sure if it's just my copy - but the music didn't seem to be in sync with the picture...bummer...might try another copy...still my favourite!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Did you like Sean Connery's Sci Fi version of \\"High Noon\\", \\"Outland?\\"  How about \\"Star Wars?\\"  The best escapist good time movie science fiction isn't that deep, it's just the Western set in the future.  This highly underrated television series (you'll like the movie better if you buy the Firefly television series DVD collection first, you only have a season to see, it didn't last long), included a marginally plausible future universe that allowed for a Western, post-Civil War look and feel, and once you surrender to the logic and physics problems, it's a totally internally consistent fictional setting.  The characters are interesting, pretty well developed, creating very entertaining teamwork challenges.  Like a lot of science fiction, we get a subtle anti-racist, pro-feminist set of sub-themes, which isn't at all preachy.  It's just the right combination of action, funny lines, and story line, this movie is fun.
B000003NA4|4.0|it's good you can under stand what she is saying that in it self is great
B000FIMG68|4.0|In a day and age of constant dumbing down, the \\"Lost\\" series has been very refreshing.  It's diverse cast (though note the surrender to American racist ignorance, since actual Iraqis don't look like Iraqis to the average American, they went with an Indian actor to play the part of an Iraqi), is talented, attractive and commendable in a an era of all-white casts.  The plots and subplots are intellecually engaging, and if you go ahead and read every book that appears in the episodes you'd have a pretty good little collection of literature as well.  Don't waste your time with its many imitations, this is the only one that's worth watching.  Seasons 1-3 were obviously planned well ahead of each individual episode, there's an overall overarching direction, add that to the everpresent attention to the smallest of details, and you're attention is captured.  I do worry about what happens after the third season, brilliant television series like this one tend to exhaust themselves after the originally planned story arc.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Caught this first at the cinema and just have to collect the DVDs. Villain in the plot may not be as great but I just love the love story and vulnerability of Superman that was portrayed not forgetting \\"little superboy\\" in the making too. All in all, love it.
B000F48CD8|4.0|It's a little hard to characterize this indie-college rock sound, but given the all-star talent of the band, I'm not at all surprised to find that this is a very creative CD.  The hit, \\"Steady as She Goes\\", caused me to buy the CD, but the rest of the CD is excellent.  I'd like to think that this will be an example of 21st Century rock 'n roll that delivered us from the monotonous and largely unoriginal \\"alternative\\" rock of the 90's.  I recommend this CD for 1) fans of the original bands that these Raconteurs come from and 2)fans of 60, 70's and 80's rock who have not listened to anything new in a while.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban really choses songs that show off his magical abilities as a singer.  His talents come through with each and every song.  Every song seems to tell a story.  Every presentation is done with beauty, style, feeling and delight.  5 star CD.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is the epitome of tall, dark, and handsome. The bow on this package however, is that voice and oh what a voice it is. It is a shame all Amavon gives is 5 stars this CD should get 100 times that. Josh is maturing into one of the greatest voices of all time, he is a true virtuoso. The 6th track \\"So She Dances\\" has got to be the most beautiful piece of music I have heard in a very long time and I just can't imagine anyone else giving it the praise that Josh Groban does. This CD is one of those I will have to replace often because I'm wearing it out from use. Thanks Josh you have made this CD worth the wait.
B000J3EEBY|2.0|Compared to her earlier cds, after waiting all these years, I was sorry I wasted my money. I was looking for more of her ballad type of songs and lerics.  After playing it thru three times I took it out of my changer and put it on the shelf.  Her voice is just as wonderful but the content of this cd sucks.
B000006UNG|4.0|This is album is a landmark in the history of Talk Talk. It really does bridge the gap between their earlier electro-pop (It's My Life) and their later albums (Spirit of Eden & Laughing Stock). This album begins their metamorphosis, much like Achtung Baby was a necessary album for U2 to make to jump from Joshua Tree to Zooropa. Overall, this is a pop album that takes chances. It's very organic and uses acoustic brushmarks to highlight it's texture. I certainly see where bands like The Catherine Wheel were influenced. There are many layers of skin to peel back on this onion as with each listen there are new sounds and rhythms to focus on yet on the surface it's still a collection of very accessible songs. Personally, the only song I can't really get into is \\"Chameleon Day\\" which is the reason I give this album a 4 star vs a 5 star. To me this is easily their best album. If you're looking for another \\"It's My Life\\", it's not here, go buy a Tears for Fears album, but if you are looking for an audio adventure, purchase this album.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Take all of the old favorites, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, etc and add Diana Krall sound and you have a hit!  This is a fantastic album. We sung along with it in the car all season.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars is such an intelligent and witty show. Every time I watch the episodes I catch something new. T.V. bores me now, so I don't really watch much of it. But popping in a Veronica Mars DVD satisfies my craving to relax in front of the tube. I've never enjoyed a show this much. It's definately worth buying the entire 1st and 2nd season. You bet I'll be buying the 3rd season when it comes out.
0618680004|5.0|After hearing this book attacked relentlessly by conservative religionists, I decided that when I had time to read it for myself, that I would do so. Well, I've read it and my verdict is this: Prof. Dawkin's book will be read for many generations to come, as Bertrand Russell's \\"Why I Am Not a Christian\\" has been read. It is full of sensible observations about religion, and these observations are made with clarity and directness. I admire Prof. Dawkin's forthright honesty. What I especially like is the freshness of perspective that he brings to the subject. Because Prof. Dawkins is a scientist (as opposed to a professional theologian steeped in religious concerns and obfuscating religious language) he brings a refreshing precision and directness to the subject. I especially like his skewerings of the Anglican theologian, Richard Swinburn.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Studio ghibli and Miyazaki are a godsend to the Animated motion picture genre. As of late I have grown tired with Disney, Pixar, etc. pumping out cookie cutter kids films consisting of overly silly talking animals, two or three 'breakout' characters and the main character stritcly adhering to their own beaten to death hero archetype. Princess Mononoke, sprited away, and all of Miyazaki's films are a breath of fresh air: they are like if Disney was still making good films. <br /> <br />Some scary scenes though, would not recommend for very young children who are easily spooked
B00000DCER|5.0|For anyone who likes Jazz and Blues, what a wonderful CD. I enjoyed from beginning to the end.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I think everyone knows about this movie and how good it is so there isn't much to say.  I bought this for a gift and it was a hit.  I also have it myself and enjoy watching it time after time.  If you haven't seen it then <br />you should....great movie.
B000J10EQU|5.0|First of all I would like to congatulate everyone behind this fantastic comeback. Superman fans couldn't have got it better.  <br /> <br />The fact that the replacement for the new Superman, Brandon Routh, being modelled after the late Christopher Reeve and his legacy is something to be lauded. The drop-dead handsome Brandon Routh excels on all fronts,  performance, style and looks. Kate Bosworth plays an adorable Louis and you couldn't ask for a better villian to replace Gene Hackman than the talented Kevin Spacey.   <br /> <br />With almost two decades of growth in special effects from the last Superman that we saw in the 80's, it was only anybody's guess that the special effects of Superman Returns had to be better. Superman Returns certainly doesn't disappoint those who came to watch this film for the effects alone. Amazing stuff. <br /> <br />The plot and story aren't bad either. The nice twist in the end about Louis's son was the icing on the cake. The movie is engaging and never with a dull moment except for some of the concluding scenes.  <br /> <br />The only blooper of course is one that runs from the very first Superman movie. How come Louis or anyone else cannot identify the thinly disguised Clark Kent as Superman.  <br /> <br />Overall a great movie for the family and one that the late Christopher Reeve would have certainly been proud of.
1401308201|4.0|I bought this book for my grandaughter who is 14. <br />She was thrilled with the stage play and I wanted her memories to never be forgotten Needless to say she was delighted and she refers to it time and time again.  <br />I was delighted with it just for it's appeal in the way it was put together. It is truly a beautiful thing. I'm glad I made this purchase.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Similar to her other work. Nice easy listening for all family members.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Wonderful selections.  We love the CD.  Typical Loreena McKennitt.  Well worth the wait. I recommend this to anyone who is a Loreena fan.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue hasn't concocted such a sweet confection since 'Fever'. I usually shun pop music like the plague, but this as some of our German friends call it 'an earworm'. It's that and a guilty pleasure, however not emabarrasing enough not to admit I own this album. It's a classic. It's Kylie Minogue's swan song. <br /> <br />Everyone knows her super-hit \\"Can't get you out of my head\\". That song is a piece of musical genius. You may call it formulaic but it's pop music, and good pop music. The chorus of this will ring in your ears for days after listening to it. <br /> <br />'CGYOMH' isn't the only gem on this disk. \\"Love at first sight\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Fragile\\", \\"Give it to me\\", \\"Come into my world\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"On The Dancefloor\\" are all standout tracks. That pretty much names them all. There is not one bad track on this. Kylie Minogue proved with this album that she is the queen of pop music. Her newer album 'Body Language' will be quite a disappointment if you like this. Hopefully this 2007 we'll see Kylie return to form, after battling breast cancer, bless her heart.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Being that this is the first season of Grey's Anatomy, there is quite a bit of good character development that goes on during season 1.  What I really enjoyed is how the creative team made sure to build in the character developments to the various story lines.  So many shows have spent the first episode or four just introducing the various characters that there's essentially no story and end up with a boring or unwatched show.  The writers of Grey's Anatomy created a show with characters and stories that are relatable to.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This remains one of the better modern-day Disney movies. Great animation, music...a classic
B000B8IA2G|4.0|If you are a fan of the series, then you need to get this set. I don't pay much attention to the Extras. <br />I like to view any series in order and a season set allows that. If you are not a big fan of the series, why bother?

B000H0MKGK|4.0|John's last album was fabulous, which is always hard for a new artist to keep up on \\"greatness\\".  This is a solidly good album and worth buying and listening to.  Each time you listen to a John Mayer song you like it more than the last time as you grow to understand the words and intent.
B00008BXJG|4.0|I bought this CD for my son for Christmas. He loved it and I would purchase it again if I had the chance.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|Ballad after ballad of poignant lyrics make this a Damian Rice must have.  Much more depressing and not quite as good as \\"O\\" but if you're a true Damien Rice fan, you'll enjoy it.

I actually screamed when I got it. :) I havn't finished reading the booklet inside yet, but it tells the stories behind all of MCR's songs and how they came to yet another great album. Everyone should get this CD! There is not a song on here that I do not like.

B0000508U6|5.0|I was a bit slow to jump on the Coldplay bandwagon.  I'd hear a song on the radio and say \\"I like this band\\" ~ then I'd see a Coldplay concert on PBS and say \\"I like this band\\" ~ but I never really went out and bought any of their CDs.  I don't know why this is... Coldplay just never popped into my mind when I was shopping for CDs. <br /> <br />I decided to change that this year, and asked Santa for Parachutes and X&Y in my stocking.  I'm so glad that I am finally the owner of this album.  Parachutes has several songs that I've heard before and said \\"I love this.\\"  I've listened to it four or five times since Christmas, and of the 30 CDs that Santa brought me (yeah, it's a big stocking!), I'd have to say that Parachutes is my favorite.  I've only listened to X&Y once so far, but it also contains a few I've heard before on the radio and said \\"I love this.\\" <br /> <br />Even though I'm a newbie Coldplay fan, I have to say that I am hooked now.  I did have another Coldplay CD before that my husband bought, but I wasn't all that crazy about it (can't even remember its name, have only listened to it once).  With Parachutes and X&Y, I will now formally and publicly state that I will listen to these again and again.  I'm even listening to Parachutes again right now as I write. <br /> <br />I love Chris Martin's voice... very easy to listen to at any time of day, whatever mood you're in.  Parachutes is good enough to turn anyone into a Coldplay fan, unless they were really close-minded and only liked hard rock, heavy metal, hip hop, or whatever, and nothing else. <br /> <br />I'm sure that all true Coldplay fans already own this one, but if you're a newbie fan like me, and considering it as an introduction to their music, you should buy it.  If you like it, try their latest X&Y too. <br />
B000I5X81K|5.0|I love Josh Groban and I bought this CD despite the fact that I heard bad things about it. I think that Josh really went out on a limb and took a risk with some of the songs on this CD. In my opinion it was a success! He has succeeded in making classical music popular in a way that no other artist has before. I love this CD just as much as the others.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This release should end once and for all the speculation that Blu-ray has inherent inferiority to HD-DVD.  The resolution, lack of artifacts, contrast, black levels, and color depth are amazing compared with stardard DVD (which I also have). <br /> <br />And the sound is something you really have to experience for yourself.  HD-DTS 5.1 is jaw-dropping if you have a system that supports it, and has the power to drive a good set of HT speakers.  I have Martin-Logan's coupled with a Denon AVR-2807, plus a Sunfire True-Subwoofer (2700 watts!).  If you have a good system, give it a workout with this disc! <br /> <br />Great Blu-ray disc--add it to your collection.  You won't be sorry.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was thrilled to get this collection.  Firefly is one of the very finest sci-fi series ever made for television.  The producers have presented them in a marvelous format in the orginal order of production.  (not the order Fox presented them)  Also included are several episodes Fox never broadcast, as well as lot's of great insightful background info and commentary.  This is a must purchase item for fans of the series, or fans of great science fiction driven by realistic dialogue and contemporary situations.

0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, is thoughtful. The book is written in diary format and leads the reader through several controversial situations. Such situations allow the reader to thoughtfully reflect on not only their reaction to the situation but also their current and past behavior in similar situations.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to young adults and adults. One does not have to be an avid reader to enjoy this book. However, be prepared to assess your effect on others' lives.
0618680004|5.0|If you have the intellectual curiosity and capacity to read this book, it may change your life. I highly recommend it.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is a jazz standard that should be in every collection. <br /> <br />There are the songs you know that are very good of course, but the ones you don't know are equally as good if not better.
0316172324|4.0|Overall, loved it.  Gladwell uses real life examples to support the basis of the book, which is essentially about the power of our subconscience.  It discusses how we have been conditioned via all the elements in our lives (media, education, etc.) to react quickly - and sometimes with extreme prejudice - in any situation.  The book illustrates how our minds can be a wonderfully useful tool, or by contrast, a dangerous liability.
0743289412|3.0|I've read nearly everyone of King's books and this is one of my least favorites.  Too slow and not scary at all.  At least it's still better than most horror writers out there.
B000003N7K|5.0|Johnny Hartman is the best male vocalist in jazz.  Coltrane, Tyner and the rest are at the top of their game.  \\"My One And Only Love\\" makes it to the top of the list for ballads.
B000I5X81K|3.0|Josh Groban's gorgeous voice is as beautiful as ever, but the material is rather ho-hum here.  I could do with a few less power ballads and more intimacy.  He doens't dig too deeply emotionally.  I  hope this is just a passing blip in an otherwise stellar career.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|I loved the first Evanescense album and a bit apprehensive that the second would be lacking due to changes in the artist mix.  Now that I have had it over a month, I like it better than the first album, which is saying a lot.  Musically extremely good, an of course fascinating lyrics.
0618680004|5.0|I have read only three chapters of the book so far.  I find it to be compelling and thought-provoking.  Dawkins, like Sam Harris, is an intellectual heavyweight.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|No se trata de las viejas canciones \\"remasterizadas.\\" Son las de siempre, sin más grabaciones extra que las \\"Anthology\\", pero con un sonido nunca oído, hechas además de nuevo.  Tras \\"Because\\" a capella, comienza un fade in que es el piano final de \\"A day in the life\\" pero al revés.  Termina con el golpe de guitarra de \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" Y ahí arranca el solo de batería de \\"The End\\" para comenzar \\"Get Back\\", que termina con \\"Glass Onion\\".  ¿Varias canciones \\"enganchadas\\"?  No, es una nueva excelente versión de \\"Get Back\\".  Y así es todo el disco.  Es difícil decir qué parte es mejor, pero desde \\"Come together\\" hasta el final, el disco tiene un vértigo infernal. Si el CD estéreo es excelente, el dvd 5.1 es increíble.  Vale la pena comprar el paquete y no sólo el CD.
0618551050|5.0|To this non-physicist, Smolin makes a convincing case that the science of cosmology is broken, and that profound institutional and social factors will prevent its getting fixed any time soon. <br /> <br />Smolin is great at describing the physics in ways that allows the lay-person to get at least a glimpse at what the debate is about. Still, the book is clearly the work of someone with an ambitious--and perhaps grandiose--agenda. There is a bit of theorizing that veers into armchair sociology. \\"Science as potentially corrupt social endeavor\\" is not a particularly original line of argument, and Smolin spends a little too much time making this point. <br /> <br />That being said, Smolin does a profound service by revealing the extent to which String Theory is founded mostly on faith and unfulfilled promises. It's easy to assume that cosmological models are supported by either empirical data or by robust, quantitative theory. It was astonishing to me that String Theory is founded on neither, and I'll certainly never again accept those claims at face value.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This was the first S&G album I ever heard and I think it's probably their best work. Simon's lyrics have rarely been more crisp, and the haunting refrain of loneliness touches every song on this album. The bonus tracks are largely filler compared with the rest of the album, but this is quintessential folk rock at its apex.
B000002LSV|4.0|What can you say about ZZ Top that hasn't already been said.  It's a CD that will bring you back in time.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Daniel-Day Lewis is riveting here, but the love story is terrible, and Diaz is especially bad. Leo is miscast -- he rarely works in period movies -- and Scorcese's vision of a nasty, messy New York is entertaining, if mildly depressing. But you watch this film pretty much for Lewis' magnetic performance.
B000H5U832|4.0|The movie is great.  Kids love it.  But I could not get the English subtitles removed from the screen.  Very annoying.
B00004WLXZ|4.0|For most of her life Riefenstahl denied being a Nazi sympathizer, but this movie makes a hard argument against that claim. It's interesting now to see a film where the Nazis are so flatteringly portrayed, and Hitler is displayed with almost god-like status (he descends from the clouds in the beginning, which must have been rare to see in the mid-30s, as few had flown then). The movie sometimes drags as we watch the speeches of minor party officials, but the spectacle never fails to impress and horrify. Instructional on a number of levels.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This is definitely a gamble on pop/goth hybrid Evanescence's part.  Some of the songs attempt to explore different facets of the band's talents.  They do an admirable job but fall short of Fallen's power.  The recent shakeup of the band's roster is probably the reason for this new direction.   <br />If, however, you are one of Evanescence's die-hard fans, little will dissuade you from purchasing this album.  But for the rest of us, you may want to sample a few singles, like Lithium, before making a commitment.
B0000UJL96|4.0|We all know the drill; the even numbered Classic Trek films are the only ones worth getting, and this DVD release is the one to get if you haven't picked up a copy of Trek VI yet. The transfer is sharp and crisp, and the extras are well-thought out and presented. A solid package.
B000I2IT44|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing PT about a year before this show at the Park West and also had the high pleasure of being at the first night of this DVD shoot. The Park West is an excellent place to see this kind of music. The layout of the seating and the accoustics make it one of the premium concert venues in the country. PT put on a near perfect show that night. The band is in top form and they perform all the cuts with a certain excitement. We took a friend and an Uncle in their 50s to the show as their first exposure to PT live. They both were old school prog fans (with the likes of Rush, Floyd etc...) They were astounded by the quality of this band and the show they put on. They have not stopped talking about it since. I would say that the DVD lives up to it's potential 100% the video is clean (the cuts can be a bit too fast), but the audio mix is simply superb. Rush could learn a thing or two about DVD mix from this show...
B00005JOCU|4.0|During Jennifer Hudson's first song (I don't remember which song that was), I turned to my friend and whispered, \\"This girl lost?\\" I was, of course, referring to American Idol. For those who don't know this, in an interesting reversal of fortunes, Jennifer Hudson beat out former American Idol winner Fantasia for the role. And now, she's nominated for a Golden Globe, and has already snagged eleven awards (see imdb). Talk about life imitating art. <br /> <br />Translating a Broadway smash to the screen is never easy, but this seemed seamless, and the other cast members, specifically Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx, lent the film extraordinary believability. <br /> <br />I generally don't enjoy musicals, but listening to Jennifer Hudson sing was absolutely a revelation. <br />
1931559317|5.0|Very handy to use. Does not take up a lot of room as full size atlases. Constellation figures are a nice feature.
6305428298|5.0|4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. <br /> <br />Jane Horrocks, who played numerous characters in the cult English sitcom \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\", shines here as a sorrowfully shy girl with a talent beyond belief. <br /> <br />After her father died, many years ago, she resigned herself to listening to his old records, and singing along with them. She soon became a virtuoso, capable of imitating Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, and others. In equally brilliant performances, Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn (Pride and Prejudice) the former wants to bring LV's talent to the world, certain that great riches are but a step away. Brenda (LV's mom) is at first completely oblivious to her daughters talent, as she is far too egocentric to notice anything or anyone but herself - unless it's a man. In that case, she's quite the player. <br /> <br />There is a somewhat interesting - although perhaps unnecessary - love interest between LV and Billy (Ewan McGregor). It seems to serve as helping LV to open up to the world, but there are so many things/occurrences that can happen to a person that incite change that I'm a little fed up with movies taking the easy way out with a love interest. AND, there was such an occurrence in the film itself. Still, Ewan plays his part well, and while his interest in LV is a bit difficult to understand, it's not entirely unbelievable. <br /> <br />What IS unbelievable is Jane Horrocks's amazing voice. You'd think that the filmmakers would have her lip synch while either a recording of Judy Garland, or someone who could imitate her, was singing. But they didn't need to do so. Horrocks did so herself. She imitated all of the artist's brilliantly, and nearly perfectly. <br /> <br />It was easy to see, after this performance, what a remarkably gifted actress she is. The characters she played on \\"AbFab\\" were hysterical and widely variant, though she is best known as the mentally challenged Bubble. <br />
0399226907|5.0|This is such a fun book, that the adult reading it will laugh out loud.  Oh, yeah, the kids will love it,too.  It is very imaginative, and the illustrations are fun.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|4.5, rounded up to 5. <br /> <br />This is a dysfunctional family. <br /> <br />Richard, the father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker with, as far as we can see, about 10 students in the class he just finished. He's trying to swing a book deal, or turn his so-far one-man show into something spectacular. We are never told what he left behind to pursue his \\"dream\\", but that's really not important. <br /> <br />Frank, the mother's brother, (Steve Carell) is the country's preeminent Proust scholar who recently tried to kill himself for a number of reasons, all entertainingly told over dinner. He's gay, as is the 2nd (according to him) most prominent Proust scholar. <br /> <br />Kinnear's father, known only as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed heroin user who was kicked out of an assisted living home. We soon learn why - other than the heroin use - when giving advice to his grandson about having as much sex as he possibly can while he's young and it's still legal to have sex with teenage girls. There's a screw or two loose there. <br /> <br />The son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a fanatical devotee of Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he joins the air force and flies a plane. He communicates through writing on a pad, and claims to hate everyone. He wears, at one point, a T-shirt that says \\"Jesus was Wrong\\". Hysterical. <br /> <br />The daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorable young girl has fantasies of winning the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Unfortunately, she's only adorable - and adorable isn't beauty pageant material. Still, this is her dream, and her family supports her enough to throw themselves in their VW van and drive hundreds of miles to get her into the pageant. <br /> <br />The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete) is the necessary straight character, and certainly the sanest of the bunch. Her presence holds everyone together. <br /> <br />With a cast of characters like this, it's impossible for a fantastic voyage not to occur. And it does. From the van breaking down so that it can only be started by everyone getting out and pushing to an improbable hospital escape, the adventure is a lively one. <br /> <br />The beauty pageant itself is extremely disturbing. I've never felt comfortable watching 8 year old girls preen about as adult women. To my sensibilities, it's the parent living vicariously through the daughter - most of the time, at least. I'm sure - like Olive - that some have dreams of their own. For those that don't, shame on the parent.  <br /> <br />Olive stands out, nearly literally, as a very sore thumb at the pageant. She does not have the makeup, the hair, the moves, or the skinny body to compete. That doesn't stop us from rooting for her. We have to, because she's easily the most endearing character in the film. We also feel tremendous pity for her, knowing that she just doesn't measure up to these other girls. Which, in itself, is sad. It's very likely that she more than measures up to them in terms of quality. <br /> <br />Olive's dance presentation, the final of the evening, is hysterical. She begins to dance - a dance her grandfather taught her - and from the very first move, the audience is in hysterics. Throughout her entire performance, most couldn't stop laughing. Her family joined her on stage toward the end, which wasn't terribly believable, but served to demonstrate their intense loyalty to Olive and her dreams. <br /> <br />The movie is centered on dreams. Richard dreams of becoming a motivational speaker; Dwayne dreams of becoming a pilot; Olive dreams of winning beauty pageants; Frank dreams of regaining his status as the preeminent Proust scholar; and Sheryl dreams of normalcy. <br /> <br />Part of the enjoyment - aside from the hilarity - is watching the development of these dreams. <br />
B00005JPDY|2.0|\\"The Good Shepherd\\" is a stunning bore, a three-hour dud chronicling the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Like its main character, the movie insists on marching through the story with a blank-faced, downward-cast look toward the ground. Maybe it succeeds as history. But it fails, utterly, as entertainment. <br /> <br />In a committed and thus dull performance, Matt Damon is Edward Wilson, a wonkish Yale grad who's recruited into the CIA by a paralytic general (Robert DeNiro) and a smarmy power broker (William Hurt) to run counterintelligence; that is, infiltrate the communists. The CIA and Russian KGB spent a lot of lives moving them around their global chessboards; Wilson, a secretive, opaque soul, is a perfect fit. <br /> <br />Eric Roth's screenplay starts with the Bay of Pigs debacle, as Wilson tries to find the leak that doomed the 1961 mission, and works in flashback to 1939, when Wilson is forced to ditch his deaf sweetheart (Tammy Blanchard) to marry the pregnant Clover (Angelina Jolie), the sister of a classmate. Jolie is ludicrous, all sex, tears, aggression and jeers - the long-suffering wife trapped in a Bette Davis melodrama. <br /> <br />DeNiro also directs, pushing the gas on that musical score and dividing the action into inert two-minute chunks. His camera won't linger or deepen our experience, chained, as it is, to Roth's dense, I-did-my-homework screenplay. DeNiro assembled gifted players - Hurt, John Turturro, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci - and gave them very little motivation. It shows. <br /> <br />Roth and DeNiro seem bent on demystifying the CIA and debunking James Bond, Tom Clancy, John Le Carre, \\"Casablanca\\" and just about every other artistic foray into the field. Fine. But don't stuff Jolie in there and have us expect credulity. Better yet, watch \\"Munich\\" on a loop and see how it's done. <br />
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Eli Roth, director and writer, certainly improved from the awful Cabin Fever, a slash and gash that made zero sense whatsoever. Hostel seems like a paragon compared to Cabin Fever.    The story by now is well known. Three randy young men - two from the U.S. and one from Iceland - are traveling together. Well, actually, *two* randy young men are traveling with a third young man who just lost his girlfriend and, although young men in general want to get it on all the time (so the film would have us believe) he is, at first, less interested in sex and more hurt by his recent loss.    The friends hear of a place in Slovakia where beautiful girls will do anything that men want them to - especially Americans. This, of course, begins a trek from Amsterdam to the city in Slovakia that holds such promise. This isn't remotely believable, unless we assume all three characters to be idiots. Travel hundreds of miles for something they're likely to get (sex) where they are? Let's not forget that they're in Amsterdam, not Mayberry (Andy Griffith Show).    But they do, for what would the movie be without said trip?    They arrive in a very war beaten town (that would have made me leave immediately - it was creepy and devoid of life), and take up lodging in a co-ed hotel. Lucky for them, their roommates are attracted to them, and they end up getting it on together. Unlucky for them, these girls are Sirens.    Oli (the Icelander) is the first to disappear, and the other friends are first confused, and then puzzled when they receive a photo from his cell phone depicting Oli and another girl with largely lifeless looks on their face.    Josh (Harry from Dumb and Dumberer) is the next to disappear, and instead of mystery, we are taken directly to where the action is, so to speak. Josh finds himself securely handcuffed to a chair, and a man with little to no remorse (who wanted to be a surgeon but wasn't allowed to) begins to torture him. Without the blink of an eye, or a hint of hesitation, this man (someone the boys oddly encountered on a train - unbelievable) takes a rather long and large drillbit, and drills a hole in his leg, then his chest, etc. etc.    Flash back to Jay (Friday Night Lights), who survived the \\"Siren song\\" only because he passed out in a janitor's closet after being drugged instead of the bathroom. His survival leads us into a house of horrors as revolting as anything we've ever seen. To Roth's credit, there are \\"rules\\" or regulations here. It isn't just a chop shop. It's art that people pay to see, and people pay to see Americans more than any others. That's a nice slap in our face, and perhaps a deserved one, seeing as we are generally disliked the world over at this point in our history.    What happens after Jay enters the chop shop is, again, believable within the parameters of the world Roth has created, and the ending is very satisfying.    There is another Hostel in the making. This film cost 4.5m to make, and grossed 47m in the U.S., also doing well in the international market. To gross 10x what it cost to make the film means it was a success, so Hostel II isn't much of a surprise. It will be interesting to see how well Roth does this time around - if he's learned as much as he did from the making of Cabin Fever, and if Hostel II is that much better than Hostel.
B00005JPGM|3.0|Africa is the issue du jour in Hollywood these days, and director Edward Zwick's \\"Blood Diamond\\" is the latest attempt to shed light on the continent's genocidal civil wars. <br /> <br />Along with the brutal, borderline-racist \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" the film is the goriest on a list that includes \\"Hotel Rwanda,\\" \\"Sometimes In April,\\" \\"Lord of War,\\" \\"The Interpreter,\\" \\"The Constant Gardener\\" and \\"Catch A Fire.\\" Zwick's production certainly is the longest; it's hard to get tired of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, two fierce actors in excellent performances, but \\"Blood Diamond\\" drives you right to the brink of tedium. <br /> <br />Charles Leavitt's plot-heavy screenplay zeroes in on Sierra Leone's 1999 civil war with little political detail. What we're shown is an overwhelmed puppet government against the rebels of R.U.F sadists who listen to Ice-T and Tupac as they shoot villagers from flatbed Toyotas and kidnap boys to become part of their war machine. <br /> <br />Fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is one such villager separated from his family and sent to a diamond pit to panhandle for gems, which are used by the rebels to pay gunrunners for weapons. He finds a 100-carat pink doozy and hides it in the red dirt. <br /> <br />Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, with a semi-consistent accent) hears of Solomon's diamond and makes a play to become his partner in relocating and selling the diamond to legitimate outfits in London, which launder the dirty diamonds, have them cut in India, then sell them, just like any other diamond, in the open market. <br /> <br />Archer, a self-described \\"soldier of fortune,\\" is weary of this arrangement and willing to sell his story to an American political journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) after he snatches the gem. <br /> <br />At its core, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is really an \\"Adventure In The Bush!\\" as Danny, Maddy and Solomon run, hide, con, bribe and kill their way back to the location of the diamond. There are three significant action sequences, all well done, all convincingly played by the actors. Archer in particular is no saint - he can crack a joke one breath, crack a skull the next - and DiCaprio gives the role the right kind of suave menace. He's a rough dude, ruthless to the last. We just happen to be rooting for him.  <br /> <br />Solomon, of course, is a near-saint as the poor, humble African looking for his family - the written character is a walking cliche - but Hounsou doesn't let the performance wander into self-pity. Screenwriter Leavitt at least addresses Solomon's servitude posture to Archer in a fight sequence that, again, is a clich but at least dissolves the gnawing sense that Hounsou is sidekick to DiCaprio's Lone Smuggler. <br /> <br />Zwick may not be a household name, but since he directed \\"Glory\\" in 1989, he's made a pile of cash - he produced \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" and the television show \\"thirtysomething\\" - and used it for costly, epic shoots. He took two years and $140 million to make Tom Cruise's bloated \\"The Last Samurai.\\" <br /> <br />Unlike the Cruise vehicle, which at least worked as a documentary-style look at the Japanese samurai culture, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is late to the topical party. Conflict diamonds may be the focus, but the exploitation and genocide of Africa is still the subject, and Zwick is more intrigued by African sunrises, rocket explosions and how many cigarettes DiCaprio can smoke. It entrenches itself in the ground level of the conflict, useful for sympathetic purposes but not so much for edification. <br /> <br />Are the conflicts of Africa about capitalist greed and men looking for their families? Yes. But it has to be about more than that. <br /> <br />I have yet to see \\"The Last King of Scotland,\\" but that story, about the rise and fall of Ugandan leader Idi Amin, and the exhaustive, powerful retelling of the Rwandan civil war found in \\"Sometimes In April,\\" seem the more essential stories now. Seek them out. Save \\"Blood Diamond\\" for a DiCaprio Saturday swoon-a-thon. <br /> <br />
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Until reading other reviews on this site, I wasn't aware that \\"V for Vendetta\\" was adapted from a graphic novel, and certainly not aware that the author/illustrator was unhappy with the finished product. This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn. While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story. The only reason stories (I'm using that as a very broad term) are made into films is because the story invoked passion of some kind in its readers. Too often, Hollywood either doesn't understand what passions were invoked in the reader, how to translate those to film, or dismisses them entirely. However, oftentimes a story is far too complex, contains too many character, too many divergent plot lines, or too many ideas for a proper translation to occur. When that happens, we either find a script that cuts to the core of the story and eliminates anything that isn't absolutely essential to the story. That's where everybody has difficulty. Hollywood and the fans of the story rarely agree on what was left out, what was left in, what was enhanced - what was essential. <br /> <br />It seems, according to reviews here, that the film remained essentially true to its core, and trimmed around the edges. That said, many here disagree vehemently. <br /> <br />That served me fine. I didn't find gaping holes or questions, and never felt that any plot line was hurried. The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against. <br /> <br />\\"V\\" was pursuing two things in the film. 1) To bring down the establishment, which had become increasingly totalitarian, and 2) to make those responsible for his creation pay. <br /> <br />Both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature. Some have said that \\"V\\" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is. This is no Batman, no Spider-Man, and certainly no Superman. He is not a crusader for good, and possesses his own set of ethics - undoubtedly burned into him in his birth. While I personally can't agree with his tactics, I never found myself rooting against him. The \\"system\\" that was in place was a horrid one, and it did need to be brought down - especially by someone who himself had been \\"brought down\\" by the system. <br /> <br />The acting is first rate, as are the special effects. <br /> <br />As I noted in the first paragraph, stories are made into film because the story invoked passion of some sort. This film certainly evoked passion in me. It's a terrifying reminder that totalitarian regimes have existed, that some have been created virtually overnight, and how perilously close we are now to slipping backward, instead of forward. <br />
B00005JPE7|3.0|Sylvester Stallone seems to have made \\"Rocky Balboa\\" as a feature-length apology for every \\"Rocky\\" movie after the Oscar-winning original. It strains to be about a character and not the size of Stallone's oiled muscles. <br /> <br />\\"Rocky V\\" treaded this ground, too, but crumbled under its overwhelming sentimentality. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is a simpler creation, more of a meditation on aging than a boxing flick. I liked it. It's humble and sincere; Stallone seeks to give purpose to life after 50 but has stopped trying to butter up his own image. Rocky's not ending racism or slurring for an end to the Cold War. He's just a \\"yo\\" with an itch to box. <br /> <br />Because actress Talia Shire refused to return to the franchise, the storyline reveals that Rocky's wife, Adrian, has died from cancer. Rocky mourns weekly at her gravestone. And he's named a restaurant after her. It's a cozy place where Rocky can tell stories and nurse wounds. Somewhat estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia), Rocky spends hours haunting South Philadelphia with Paulie (Burt Young). <br /> <br />His routine changes when he runs into neighborhood girl Marie (Geraldine Hughes). Marie's a bit of a love interest, but more an opportunity for Rocky to reconnect with the outer world. Once he does, he senses a \\"beast\\" inside. It says, \\"Box.\\" <br /> <br />And he'll get his shot in an exhibition against the heavyweight champion. Stallone makes this ridiculous scenario borderline plausible - just look at the state of boxing, and you have to admit it might happen - by integrating ESPN and HBO TV personalities into the screenplay. <br /> <br />The fight itself - against Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon - is a schizophrenic mix of a HBO broadcast and \\"Raging Bull\\" choreography. But the rest of \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is crafted with restraint. Gone are the endless matching shots and music video editing from Stallone's earlier efforts. This is a decent and measured close to a series that deserved a little better <br />
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Hollywood should learn something from productions like this. My only complaint is that I never really became emotionally linked to the characters and their turmoil and plight. Perhaps it was the nature of the characters themselves and their emotional reserve. Perhaps it was an incomplete portrayal of the characters themselves. Whatever it was, I felt more like a silent, uninvolved watcher rather than a participant. <br />Still, just an excellent production.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I absolutely love Grey's. The humor, the drama, I don't know anyone that dislikes watching the show. It is a very intelligent show, appealing to just about all demographics.
0689878451|5.0|This true story has an important social message about the different forms that \\"family\\" can take, while it can also be understood on a very basic level as a catchy narrative about penguins.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|We enjoy this series and were excited when it came out on DVD.  Too bad there is only Season 1 available.  However, we enjoy watching it as a family.
1594200823|5.0|The author went through a lot of time and effort to be very thorough in his research of the different food industries.  He brings some good ideas to teh table and opens up your mind to what we need to do to change this world for the better with the simple ideas of controlling our world's health with how we eat.
B000058983|4.0|I had this album on back in the '60's. I listened to quite a bit back then. It was one of my favorites. After hearing it again after all these years I would say that most of it holds up. Every song is worth listening to. Some of the lead guitar work seems a little stiff by todays standards, but the songs themselves are treasures. The bonus tracks are interesting upon first listen, but I would have prefered they be left off so the form of the orginal album would be in tact. All in all, for those who remember it the first time around, it is well worth a revisit.
032147404X|5.0|I have tryed to learn the basics of photography, but all the books were confusing and could teach you little.  After reading this book I went on Amazon to see what else he wrote.  The book is very informative and one I have learned the most from. If you are trying to get the most from your photos and want a pros help without all the hype this is a great book.  I put this book in my gear bag and have used it many times to get the most of my photos.  There is not one item in this book that was not of help.  Again great book great author
B000002BNB|5.0|I love this CD so much, I have bought it 3 times!! No music these days can compare to these lyrics and beats!

0307236722|5.0|This book was a gift for my daughter.  She had seen it and wanted this for Christmas.  I purchased this for her.  I received it promptly and in very good condition and less money than it would cost to buy at the local book stores.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I purchased this sci-fi show after follwoing its first and second seasons with great admiration.I must admit Stargate sg1 was pretty cool and I had my reservations as to whether this show would make it through the first season let alone go on to its third. <br /> <br />The fact I only paid very little for this was a bonus,although I did have it on my list of wants.The show stands up to its predecessor and seems to get better. <br /> <br />The dvd is well packaged with great extras and worth every penny.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Are are just so many Christmas songs out there.  James Taylor does a fantasitc job at covering many of the old standards and makeing them his own.
B00005MP58|5.0|This was a gift and the recipiant really has enjoyed it.  It arrived in a timely manner.  I couldn't be more pleased.
B000059T00|5.0|This is one of those \\"must-haves\\" for any person interested in the evolution of rock.  Ginger Baker is amazing, as usual.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|A little lacking on special features but it was just as described and came quickly!
1572814349|5.0|The collaged imagery is divine and the cards are of very good quality. A joy to work with and a worthwhile addition to anyone's Tarot deck collection.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This was a very non-traditional Christmas CD that still had some traditional songs thrown in.  I really enjoyed the CD and enjoy all music performed by Sarah McLaughlin.
0743289412|5.0|I am a true Stephen King fan and have most of his books. This one was a bit different, but I loved it just the same. I even got spooked from reading it, which is such the benefit from reading a Stephen King novel! hee hee. I seriously could not put the book down 1) because I was so into it and 2) because there are chapters but they don't \\"end\\", they go right into the next chapter, some without even so much as a period at the end of the sentence. The story has a lot of back and forth from the past and the present, so you really have to pay attention. The 500+ page book was completed by me in 3 days. I can't wait for the next one! <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|I watched Kill Bill Vol. I for the first time on regular tv.  It was so intense and full of action that I watched it again immediately.  I like action and adventure and this movie has plenty of both.  Add the perfect cast and this movie is a real winner.  I couldn't wait to add it to my DVD collection.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John struts his stuff well on this CD, expressing himself more deeply through the heartfelt lyrics and is very in touch with his strat.  The music just flows and doesn't feel forced nor contrived.  In my opinion this CD marks where John Meyer comes of age.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I ordered Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 at the same time.  You just can't get the whole breathless story unless you watch them together.  I love the action and intensity of the movies and I think the cast is superb.  Uma Thurman was amazing and I found it hard to take my eyes off her.  I recommend these movies to any action junkie.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I loved this DVD and I recomend for everyone because it is Spetacular and  <br />Wonderfull.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Love this group of singers...they are a perfect match made in heaven.  Their appeal is universal.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I grow up in Europe and remembered this when Aled Jones had the hit with \\"Walking in the Air\\".  This is a beautiful DVD and is soothing to watch.  A perfect alternative to other Christmas movies.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I love No Doubt. Great Record. True to Rock Steady sound in Jamaican music. Was even recorded in Jamaica.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent! The special effects are fantastic. We have really enjoyed the series and wish it would have continued longer.
B000008B01|5.0|After I had read the previous reviews and I had listened into the songs, I decided to buy this album. It is fantastic: Gilberto concentrates on the essential, the music is not overcrowded. It is stunning, sublime. What else could I say? Listen and go for it.
B000I5X81K|5.0|It just doesn't get much better than this!  A beautiful voice, a beautiful young man singing beautiful music.  What's not to like?  I own all of Groban's CDs and will certainly buy the next one also.
B00018D44U|3.0|Contrary to her fantastic first album this is a boring follow-up. I only managed to listen to it once, it is so annoying. I very much await her upcoming third album so that I can forget this bloomer.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars is a really fun movie with a great message.  It is, however, (or it seems to me), primarily a \\"kid's flick\\".  There is some adult humor, the animation is wonderful, the colors are bright and the \\"voices\\" fit their characters very well.  Children will want to watch it over and over, I think, but for me once was enough.
B000EJ9N6Y|5.0|All my female friends who come over to me and have the chance to listen to this album ask me to copy it for them (or to be politically correct: lend it to them...). What could be a better review than this??? So go and see for yourself!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is one of my favorite artists.  He lived up to his potential on this CD.
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies. Disturbing, yes, (don't watch w/ the kids)but hilarious and tragic ath the same time.
B000028U0Y|5.0|what a show. side talk and all it is one of the best live shows I own.
B000H305U0|3.0|There were only three songs that I loved, (two of them are on the radio). There were a few I could stand, and I couple I had to skip when they came on. I was expecting more dance-style/hip-hop, however I was disapointed with most of the songs, as they didn't excite me as much as I antiscipated.
0060899190|5.0|This book will catch your attention and you've finished the entire thing before you realize it. You can identify with some and your heart goes out to another. When your own secrets spin round in your head, now you know that everybody else's does, too.
B000JCETDS|4.0|If you loved the movie, you already know you'll love the soundtrack. If you're a fan of comedy music and you haven't been introduced to Tenacious D, maybe their previous album is a better place to start- though this one has several superior tracks it may depend a little on already knowing about Jable's and Kyle's lyrical exploits. The only bad thing I can saw about this album critically is that it's way too short, being barely over 30 minutes.
B000HKCRW2|5.0|They're gonna make you smile. I really enjoy this CD. It is incredibly fun and has great dance beats for the first half of the album. Then it calms down. It is probably a great CD to play at a party form its climax to when people start to wind down and leave. <br /> <br />Throw this CD in and you'll probably find it hard not to move some part of your body to the music. Great disco beats, catchy lyrics which can either be really deep or really asinine, I'm not quite sure, Led-Zeplin style vocals at times, mellow at others. These guys rock. Wind it up now!
0321344758|5.0|This book is a must read for all web developers, and it is a SHOULD read for everyone else. I've transcribed the most important topics in the book and I have them hanging next to my computer. <br />After reading this book, you will not look at anything the same. I immediately question Firefox's software updates that force me to click two buttons. I've noticed my DVR suffers from poor usability issues. Everything in my car is now questioned, as are house plans, kitchenware, highway layouts. Everything.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This album is really amazing. Emotions bleed through every note, and it is not quite as formulaic sounding as their past work. In other words, not every song slowly builds up, reaches a huge climax, and dies down which seems to be the case on () and ágætis byrjun. I enjoyed those CDs as well, but it is hard to distinguish between songs. I'm also glad they are back to singing in Icelandic and not \\"Hopelandic\\". Really, I understand both to about  the same degree, but I like to think I'm subconsciously learning a language when listening to music. <br /> <br />Gong is a particular favorite track on here. If you haven't heard Sigur Ros yet, this is a great album to start.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I love Il Divo, however, their past CD's are a bit better than this one....
0312330537|5.0|A gripping story filled with passion and adventure. <br />A very entertaining nonfiction novel with a gallery of exciting characters, with ruthless power and local color you are allured into spending hours alone with the suspense and atmosphere it creates. <br />Bravo Gregory David Roberts, keep them coming...
0060899190|5.0|This book has the extraordinary ability to allow the reader to open a tiny window into the secret lives of everyday people.  These little exposures are thought-provoking and can remain with you.  The reader will be able to relate to the secrets that other people keep.  Once you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down !!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I purchased North and South having never heard of it before.  With the first viewing, I fell in love.  Rich characters and great story lines keep you watching all four episodes in one sitting.  While Elizabeth Gaskell does not write with the humor of Jane Austen, her characters and plots are just as wonderful.  If you love Jane Austen, you will love North and South.  I have since purchased copies for my friends and family to enjoy.
B000HCPU0Q|5.0|Now together in one handy box, with great art, lots of bonus tracks... a collector's eargasm of crucial punk rock. The only thing that should keep you from buying this is that it's a bit costly. But if you're a true Clash fan you must get it. Try not to think about the crass commercialism of it--try to picture it as \\"the guys in the band finally get their due.\\" Do it for Strummer's kids!
0307237699|5.0|Obama may be new to the political scene, but he expresses an honest and realistic hope for the future of our country.  He appears to be a honest man who looks seriously at the issues and has some solutions that seem reasonable, in this time of chaos.  Our country is in need of a new direction, and this man appears to be someone who may be able to inspire some new blood into the political system

B000HEWEJO|5.0|Arrived quickly, made a great gift that made my mother cry (which made me and my sister cry) when she opened it.  Just such an inspirational movie that everyone should see and even own! :)
0060977493|2.0|I disliked this book very much. From the beginning it never caught my interest. I love to read and I usually can't put a book down b/c I need to know what happens next. This book however I would need to take breaks from it because it was soo slow. If I shut that book at any point I never felt the need to finish it. I don't recommend it. It is very boring and drawn out.
032147404X|5.0|I found this to be a great resource especially for someone like me who is starting off in photography as in general.  Would definitely recommend!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Watching this documentary it dawned on us how severe the situation has become. <br />There is irreversible damage done to absolutely helpless exposed natural <br />ecosystems like the extinction of species due to alteration of their habitats - done by us.... so called superior.... I would call it rather <br />ignorant, reckless, careless, inconsiderate and the likes the way we treat <br />our fellow earth neighbors with our actions. <br />Perhaps the most profound conclusion/consequence is that all the wrong <br />doing is at the end bouncing and returning right back to ourselves. <br />Unfortunately, other creatures that mean and cause no harm suffer with it. <br /> <br />It was heart wrenching only to hear that polar bears drown ...., after frantically searching and swimming for a save platform of ice. <br />That is just .... I don't have words to describe this crime and cruelty. <br /> <br />I will do my part to slow this path of destruction ....  <br />I believe we all owe it,  <br />to ourselves, nature and this wonderful and unique planet we call earth. <br /> <br />One can do this with the determination of <br />one who comes to term with an illness and wants to heal. <br /> <br />May God help us with this one.  <br /> <br />Roland, Colorado
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is a must see for all ages. The choices for the voices is great!
0375505091|5.0|This compilation of work by Annie Leibovitz is magnificent.  The stories are told by the pictures alone.  Wonderful purchase.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Seriously an A+ movie.  I loved the extended versions after only seeing the regular cuts in theaters!  The DTS sound was unreal on my HT system!
0679809015|4.0|We purchased this book for our 16 month old daughter, but we have not really read it too often, so I am not able to give an accurate review.  I thought the book would be larger than it was; it is a small square chunk book.  My daughter doesn't love barn animals, so it's not one of the books that she pulls off her bookshelf.  It is a cute book though.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Another great CD by Zombie.  Every song is good; no skipping tracks on this CD!
1933784032|4.0|If you are looking for a nicely laid out book this is it.The picture quality is real good but detail freaks beware ... This is not the book you want if you are building or super detailing a model starship from the Star Wars galaxy.It has nicely detailed photos but only from certain angles or some of the photos don't contain the whole model ie The Super Star destroyer.So if you are a fan of the Star Wars movies like me you will find the book interesting and very fascinating along with the sidebars from Lorne Peterson.A must have for the fan
0380713802|3.0|After reading \\"A short History of Nearly everything\\", and as a travel-lover, I decided to buy this book from Bill Bryson.  <br />I have to say that after reading it it left me a bittersweet sensation. On the one side it is quite funny, specially the first part of the book. However, on the other hand it is too much topic based and many times the author exagerates too much about things. <br />On the whole, funny, but a bit out of date and at some points too biased from today's Europe. <br />
076781326X|4.0|I like this movie, my favorite thing about it is the songs.  I wish I could find the soundtrack for it!  <br /> :-) <br />
1594200696|5.0|The classic guidelines for writers are all still here - and all still valid! - but the illustrations bring a new perspective.  Wonderful gift for anyone who loves writing, words or the English language.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Saw this as a kid in the theatre with my parents and now my kids watch it with me! Everyone in our family quotes from this movie-sometimes we quote from the extras. Picture perfect after all these years.
1592402038|4.0|Being fond of phrases and in general the correct use of the English language our family found this book both amusing and true.  Of course we all use the language in our own way and sometimes our errors are more interesting than the correct way and thats okay too. <br />

0394800389|5.0|My Pre-schooler love hearing Mommy & Daddy \\"mess up\\" while trying to read this tongue twisting first reader book.  It's very funny - takes rhyming words and makes a game out of linguistic education.  Starts out with \\"Fox in socks\\" and romps through to end with \\"tweedle beetle puddle muddle fuddle duddle...\\".  The trip through is hilarious to kids and challninging to read to both kids and adults!  When you can read it fine - try it faster!  Hours of entertainment from three generations - fun to read or listen to it read....
0375505091|5.0|O livro detonou uma crise existencial; foi como um soco no estômago, só consegui processar algumas conclusões 2 dias depois (às vezes mil anos são como um dia). <br /> <br />O livro conta uma história de amor sem palavras, com nascimentos, alegrias, tristezas e mortes. Annie mostra a realidade: não maquia ou esconde o que acontece. Porque a vida é feita de coisas boas e nem tão boas assim, enroladas todas juntas num mesmo novelo. Algumas cenas são bem cruas, quando ela fotografa Susan no leito de morte e depois o cadáver. Achei um pouco forte. Tenho uma amiga, por coincidência fotógrafa (que também comprou o livro por causa de um artigo do Ruy Lindenberg publicado no M&M) e ficamos incomodadas com os retratos.  <br /> <br />Nós, filhos da pós-modernidade, temos dificuldade em lidar com coisas que não temos controle, \\"editamos\\" as melhores partes. Mas mostrar a vida como ela é (fazendo história) é assim: não podemos determinar onde ela começa ou como termina; o nosso olhar capta apenas um frame.  <br />  <br />Esquecemos que *história é para ser vivida e aceita* (gostemos ou não). E informação (linguagem racional) é para ser trabalhada.   <br /> <br />Na maior parte das vezes lidamos com informações (linguagem da razão) e isto é cômodo porque moldamos de acordo as nossas conveniências dando começo, meio e fim (no documentário Janela da Alma, José Saramago fala que \\"gostamos de coisas que fazem sentido\\"). <br /> <br />Percebi que o desconforto causado pelo livro é bom porque a função da arte é exatamente esta: despertar os olhos do coração e fazer a gente parar, pensar, refletir, transformar. Poucas pessoas na propaganda atual têm talento e coragem para quebrar regras; no passado tínhamos artistas do quilate de Picasso, Van Gogh, Gauguin, mas e hoje? Será por isto que temos tão poucos pensadores? <br /> <br />No meu caso, percebi o quanto preciso crescer. Porque transito bem quando se trata de informação, mas quando envolve linguagem emocional, tenho muito chão pela frente. A coragem da Annie Leibovitz é um convite para amadurecer.

0131103628|5.0|This book is the gold standard for C programming.  I have found it to be useful for both standard PC programs and embedded programming.  It does not cover GUI design or other platform-specific items, but if you just want to write a parser or scientific analysis program, this has exactly the information you will need.
B000F0V0LI|5.0|If you love classic westerns, this is worth owning! The added extras give insight into a great film. Superb picture quality. My only nit-picking is that something more might have been done to improve the 1950's mono audio quality.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Excellent movie in both it's colored and black and white versions. A very traditional movie to watch every year. It shows how a young girl is led to believe by her mother that there is no such thing as Santa Clause. The girl and the mother eventually find out the true meaning of Christmas with the help of a old gentleman claiming to be Santa Clause and the laywer next door. <br /> <br />The movie shows how us that even then and now how much Christmas is commercialized and takes away from the true meaning of Christmas. In the gift of love to family,friends and loved ones,and the exchanging of gifts. A feel good movie though in excellent respects for the young and old to watch. The remake is good too in it's own.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Firstly: you get a really good mix which covers all of his 6 releases  Secondly: you get 2 disc for the price of one  Finally: you get an excellent production/sound quality.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I absolutely loved the whole season of LOST. I can't wait to buy the 3rd season when it comes out!!!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|if you're a fan of the series, or a fan of FF7 especially, check out this movie. the action scenes are great, voice acting is well done, and the music is perfect.
B000G759LW|4.0|I'm glad Miss X came to her senses and stopped feeling like she had to compete with all of the no talent tramps posing as female vocalists in music today. This the first album of hers that I think really showcases her true vocal talent, not just the 'Star Search' vibrato that everyone else overuses but the control that a seasoned artist with nothing to prove skillfully employs.
B000BGH22W|5.0|This album is a must for an Harry Potter fan, both young and old, from the mild to the extreme. I also recommend the entire collection of soundtracks to the movies. Each one is full of calm, soothing melodies we have come to enjoy from Harry Potter.

1582701709|4.0|The value of reading this book is not in believing every individual assertion made.  Instead, it's the \\"big picture\\" that makes sense.  Essentially, it says that \\"what we pour our effort into, we bring\\"...the power of positive thinking.  If you don't like some aspect of your life, and all you do is complain about it and worry about it and think about it, nothing will change.  But if you can find a vision of what you truly desire, put yourself in a mindset that you are there, and even act like you have what you are looking for, then \\"the force of the universe\\" will help you help yourself to acheive.  There are plenty of anecdotes.  Some of them are too conveniently easy and grand for me to swallow.  All the same, I liked the overall message.  However, don't mistake it for a \\"self help\\" book.  It's interesting and can give you some perspective, but it's heavy and theory but weak on strategies.  I think it's up to the reader to find your own strategies to make to concept work for you.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I wanted to purchase the Star Wars Triology for episodes I, II, and III.  What I got was IV,V,VI.  The movies are fine.  They just aren't the ones that I wanted.  The product description on-line was incomplete and misleading.
B000JVT092|4.0|This movie picks up at the end of Superman 2. Superman 3 and 4 (which were horrible ) were completely ignored as they should be. It's as if director Singer was stating this is what Superman 3 should have been. New comer Brandon Routh was better than expected and Kevin Spacey was excellant as Luthor. HD-DVD's are excellant and will probably win the format wars. What the heck is a Bluray anyway. HD-DVD players cost 500$ while Bluray players cost 1000$. Same quality for half the price..It's a no brainer.
1591396190|5.0|I enjoyed this book and it's perspective on the need of businesses to seek out totally new areas.  Go where others are not, not head to head.   It give some interesting commentary and applications. Not a magic bullet, but a new way to look at competition.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie.  I was very skeptical of the movie after seeing the play, but found it to be excellent.  The actors, scenery, costumes and, ofcourse, the music were wonderful.  It is a more modern version of the play, which makes it even better.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|<br /> <br />this was fantastic. a fun romp through my childhood and through my rock dreams. amazing. everyone should have a copy. as far as the bonus discs, i would suggest the WalMart one first. its the best extra show.
0743298020|2.0|At first glance, this book looked very interesting:  a reclusive, dying novelist choosing an unknown writer to share her life secrets.  Moreover, the secrets she promised to reveal seemed to be very exciting.  However, even though Ms. Setterfield is a talented writer, her novel failed to deliver.  At times the novel moved very slowly, as unimportant details were given too much attention.  Most importantly, the story was not that enthralling -- the mysteries of this woman's life were not that interesting.  I suppose that I was expecting something different from this book, but I was disappointed.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|One of the best CD purchases I've ever made!  The 2 CD set - one CD For Living and one CD For Loving complement each other well.  The CDs contain all of George Michael's big hits, including those from his days in Wham!  <br />There are also a couple of songs on the set that I never heard before: \\"As\\" with Mary J. Blige and \\"Heal the Pain\\" with Paul McCartney.  Both songs showcase George Michael's talent. <br />This CD set is a must for anyone who loves George Michael's music.
0553383663|5.0|I would highly recommend this book! In fact, I liked it so much that I bought it for my son, my boyfriend and my colleague for the holidays! It was fascinating to read how this company got started, what it's like to work there and the thinking behind some of its features that I never paid attention to before. It's also very fast reading. Anyone who uses Google (and that's everyone!) will enjoy this book!
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Great show. My kids watch it all the time and easy for adults to watch over and over too!
0316236535|5.0|This book has been one of our favorites.  Both my 7 year old son and his 3 year old sister have went through phases where this was the one book that got toted around the house to be read over and over by mom or any willing sibling.  A wonderful book!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My family has enjoyed this movie for years on tv, but they have all but stopped showing it.  It is great to run in the background during family gatherings, because there is no dialogue to get lost in, just beautiful illustrations brought to life.  The soundtrack is magical, I play the main theme year round - it never fails to calm and restore me.
076790592X|5.0|I absolutely love this book; i've cried through its pages, i've anticipated some of the events to come and gotten excited, I am not finished with book but I am sure this is a book I will use as prescribed reading with my high school students. Read it and you'll find yourself conversing with yourself and reconsidering your priorities. Love it! <br />Enrique.

B000002I27|5.0|I've always taken the Doors with a grain of salt--I love the cosmopolitan influences that contribute to their unique, dark fusion of hard rock and psychedelia, and I really love Jim Morrison's inimitable baritone voice.  However, I've found Morrison to be a constantly overrated lyricist who had a few transcendental moments but produced equal amounts of uninspired, shallow, and atrociously-rhymed lyrics, often obviously choosing predictable rhymes or  choosing a word that doesn't fit the idea just because it rhymes.  However, I do enjoy their music very much, and I find that Strange Days (along with their debut) is the album I come back to most often.<br /><br />Any radio-listener will recognize several songs--the gnarly blues-guitar riff and hot harpsichord of \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" the sing-song paranoia of \\"People are Strange,\\" and the trippy hard rock of \\"Strange Days.\\"  Unlike a large number of Doors albums, though, the rest of Strange Days is pretty uniformly strong as well.  From slower, jazzier numbers like \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" to the driving rock of \\"My Eyes Have Seen You,\\" to the downright spooky \\"I Can't See Your Face in My Mind,\\" the album contains strong examples of the Doors' trademark musical mishmash of jazz, classical, blues and psychedelic influences.  \\"Horse Latitudes\\" is also one of the most compelling and creepy piece of Jim Morrison's poetry ever recorded.  Finally, the album's closer, \\"When the Music's Over\\" is an instant epic classic.  Its deliciously funky organ riff intro gives away to a classic Morrison howl and some classical episodes of scary imagery and dark hippie ethos.<br /><br />As usual, the flamenco-inspired guitar is lively and varied, the jazz-inflected drumming is spot-on, and the keyboards are virtuosic and range across several instruments and styles.  The Doors may have hit hardest on their debut, but with Strange Days they showed their staying power and even improved their formula.  Highly recommended for radio fans of the Doors looking to dig a bit deeper.the Doors looking to dig a bit deeper.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|One of our favorite movies of all time.  History, drama...well directed and acted... what else can you ask for?
B0000027I6|5.0|Amused to Death is the best solo album in Roger Waters' career (to this point, at least. We'll see if he ever releases that new one he's been supposedly working on for the last 8 years).  Not only that, it's the strongest work he's done since Pink Floyd's 1977 album, [[ASIN:B000024D4R Animals]].  Amused to Death finds Waters tackling even more grandiose themes than he did with Pink Floyd, but more successfully and with more heart and far fewer ego-laden songs about himself.  Not only that, it's also musically more interesting and diverse than all of his solo records and the difficult Final Cut and filler-choked Wall.  On top of that, it's over 70 minutes in length--nearly the length of the celebrated double LP of The Wall.  Give Amused to Death a chance, and you may find that it's every bit as good, and in some ways better, than Pink Floyd's celebrated later work.<br /><br />The album, like pretty much anything Roger Waters has done since Dark Side of the Moon, is a concept album in which the tracks blend together.  This time, Waters is focused on (among many other things) the subtly dehumanizing effects of the spectacle that is mass media.  Along the way, he manages to cuttingly claim that God is merely a representation of what people want and is shamelessly broadcast on TV (\\"What God Wants\\"), war is motivated by the money-hungry cowards who take none of the mortal risks and is also advanced as entertainment (\\"Perfect Sense,\\" \\"The Bravery of Being Out of Range,\\" \\"Late Home Tonight\\"), and the sad fact that, in a culture where things only matter if they're on TV (\\"Watching TV\\") we will eventually become so desensitized to what real life is like that we will become--you guessed it--\\"Amused to Death.\\"  Although this is the main theme, it's much more diverse and less heavy-handed than some of Roger's other concepts (i.e. the Final Cut).  Through the process of the album, Waters also exhibits a sense of humanism and heart never before shown in his recordings--\\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\" sets a WWII vet's heartbreaking recollections to music, \\"Too Much Rope\\" finds a shining ray of humanity (even on TV), and \\"Three Wishes,\\" a more personal track, ruminates on unchangeable mistakes.<br /><br />All of this grandiose thematic material is handled surprisingly well by Waters, who is at his lyrical best spitting out irony in the form of what God wants, interweaving the complexity of religion with the Western war machine, humorously copping a Dylan impression (he sounds like a tired old man on most of the album already), and even humorously belittling Andrew Lloyd Webber (be sure to check out the Kubrick-related backward message on \\"Perfect Sense P. 1\\").  His always dark lyrics are this time combined with some difficult but sincere bouts of optimism, generally relating to humanity at its best, which lends the album a touching heart that's more compelling with every listen.<br /><br />The other factor that brings this typically well-produced, flawlessly hi-fi album above Waters' other work is the music.  Amused to Death finds Roger covering much more stylistic ground than before, with not only rock/ blues rock, but also some country (with the help of Don Henley), 40's pop, and an idiosyncratic take on gospel.  A great boon to this sound is Jeff Beck, who plays ridiculously wicked guitar throughout--when he comes in on \\"What God Wants p. 1,\\" that axe could rip the paint off of your walls.  He's also deftly accompanied by some very talented background singers who sometimes handle lead next to his rough but well-aged vocals.<br /><br />I highly recommend Amused to Death to any Pink Floyd fan, especially fans of [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]] and [[ASIN:B0001KZM3O The Final Cut]] since I think it's similar to both and also superior.  I also recommend it most highly out of all the Pink Floyd solo works (yep, it's better than Gilmour's beautifully-textured but lyrically pedestrian solo records)  It's a truly commendable combination of rock with progressive social vision, and has also made a positive difference in my worldview and life--can't say that about too many records.also made a positive difference in my worldview and life--can't say that about too many records.

0060763280|3.0|Overall, a fairly good book with a lot of principles I've heard before. On the plus side: good, basic information on wealth consciousness and some exercises to help you reach your goals. On the negative side: you need to attend his introductory \\"free\\" seminar (which actually costs $96 for training materials, plus room & board for 3 days) to get your \\"money Blueprint\\" reprogrammed and be open to accumulating wealth.

B000HT386M|5.0|I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan and I think he's made a fantastic transition from his non-sensical comedies to his more recent thought provoking works like this one.  This movie helps put life into perspective and it worth watching.  Show it to the workaholic in your family.
B000301YY8|5.0|I initialy saw this on my son's wish list, and realized \\"You're so beautifu\\" was on the CD, and also bought it for myself. The lyrics are thoughtful and at times intense. My only negative is that when listened to from beginning to end, there is a sameness to the music. I still highly recommend the CD.
B00005NKK8|5.0|It was a huge delight to find this CD on my first try.  My grandson, age 9, has listened to the one I have in my car sooo many times that he asked for it as a Christmas gift.

The duet with Natalie Cole adds new charm to \\"Baby, It's Cold...\\", leading me to hear it in a totally new way after hearing it for many, many years.  Strangely enough, his \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" makes me want to slow dance to it, and that puts a new tone on it, to be sure.  I just love the whole CD!

Up tempo is not her forte, but, like the truly great interpeters of good songs, she is not frightened of silence. It's what you don't sing that makes the thing work.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of all time! Amy Lee has an amazing voice.  If you liked the first album you will love this one.  My favorite track on the album is \\"Good Enough\\" which is the last song. Amy sings with such emotion and just makes you feel every song!  This album is a must have!
B0001FR3IG|3.0|I found this movie to be very good in the 'horror dept.' It was full of surprises and many twists and turns. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, surprise!<br /><br />That being said, it was a bit difficult to follow and I found that I actually had to watch it twice to get the full gist of the plot.<br /><br />The movie arrived in very good condition and I was very impressed with how fast it was shipped to me.<br /><br />If you're a Halle Berry fan, and you're into the paranormal, I would definitely recommend this one!

Colorful characters and imaginative places along with a lovable main character make this a pleasure to read.  If you like witty dry humor, and interesting Sci-Fi you will enjoy this book.  This is nothing like Martin's other books and it is breath of fresh air.  I highly recommend this book.

B000H0MKOC|4.0|This is a nicely paced feature that is not too preachy and is well casted.  It employs humor, irony, drama and all the elements that make for a good film.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to review the plot, because I am certain that lots of other people have already done this, but I will say that this sort of movie could have easily become some sort of sermon or lecture that harped on about points that have already been made a million other times in a million other places, but the movie never falls into that trap.  It is entertaining throughout.

B000HEZF0E|5.0|All 3 movies were restored with great care in this set.  MI2 looks incredible considering when it was filmed.  MI 1 looks good.  Its not \\"HD\\" looking but its clearer than the dvd orig and the blacks are very good.  MI3 looks true HD.  Probably one of the highest resolution movies Ive seen on HD so far.  <br /> <br />Extras are pretty lame on the first movie and not too much there on the second either.  The thrid movies has quite a bit.   <br /> <br />Overall this is a great set if you are a fan of the series.  It was rated to look slightly better on HD DVD than blu ray but I havent verified this myself.
1401308201|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for my best friend after she saw the musical in Chicago.  I thought it would be an interesting book from seeing it on Amazon, similar to some other behind the scenes books I have purchased, but I couldn't have been more wrong!  The Grimmerie is so much better than any other book I have ever purchased about a musical.  First off, the cover is amazing, but when you open it up, it just gets better.  The full color pictures and illustrations are gorgeous, and the text gives you an incredible insight into all that went into the making and production of this musical.  Now that I've seen hers, I'm going to have to buy one for myself!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has even a vague interest in Wicked.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|When Reds was realeased in theaters, I saw it and was blown away, by the subject matter, the acting and the use of \\"witnesses\\" who commented on the historical John Reed and Louise Bryant.  The movie holds up surprisingly well.  The lead performances are indeed superb.  But the special edition is ultimately extremely disappointing because the special features are a squandered opportunity.  Warren Beatty says in his interview he doens't really care for DVD intervierws.  And after hearing him natter on about production trivia, neither do we.  \\"The making of..\\" could have been a single interesting feature, not all the features, as here.  Where is the documentary about the real John Reed and Louise Bryant?  Where is the feature explaining who these \\"witnesses\\" are and how they were chosen?  25 years later all the producers could come up with is Warren Beatty, diminishing the power of his own performance by his own self-involved chatter.  Jack Nicholson says \\"Reds\\" is educational, but its real educational value could have come with thoughtful DVD features tilting toward actual historical reality.  This DVD is really a shame.
0156027321|4.0|I rather enjoy the first part of the book where the boy, Pi, is trying to incorporate every religion into his life. As a child you wouldn't think there is nothing wrong with that, it just goes to show that adults really complicate things that should be simple.<br /><br />Sadly, I couldn't see how this contributed to anything later in the story. I didn't feel that he applied his knowledge to his survival and the book could have been done without the religion.<br /><br />I also felt the author had a tendency to over-explain things which as you can tell from other reviews caused boredom.<br /><br />All in all it kept me entertained enough to get through it. I was glad I finished it because ending offers you a good surprise and something to keep you thinking for awhile.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I love The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance. The cd sounds a lot more mainstream punk than what we have heard before from MCR, but the CD still contains the unique feel of MCR.
076531178X|5.0|After the great experience with Elantris I was very curious to his next book and a bit afraid he might not be able to handle the pressure after such a great debut, but he proved me wrong. Great book which draws you in from the first page and has a wonderfull magic system. I sure like to see what he is planning next and can't wait for his next book. Just think that reading my review is waisting you time that you could be spending reading this marvelous adventure.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is by far the best John Mayer cd yet. It has everything we love about John Mayer and such quality of songs. It is absolutly wonderful!
B00008G6EZ|3.0|I may be completely in the minority here, so please read all the reviews, then buy the recording and judge for yourself. The worst part about the Bartoli production, in my opinion, is well, Cecilia Bartoli.     My tastes tend to trend towards the Gardiner productions.  I love both the Gardiner Cosi and his Nozze, both of which, of course come with Rodney Gilfry, who is masterful as both Guglielmo and the Count.  So I came in with big hopes that this production would be as wonderful as those.  The problem is not Gilfry in the Bartoli production, nor is it Harnoncourt's conducting.    If we assume that Mozart's music is a close to heavenly as humanly possible, or sublime, and lacking any hint of gaudiness, then Gardiner does a pretty good job of matching angelic voices with angelic music. Hillevi Martinpelto's Dove Sono is one of the best I've ever heard. And Roocroft, while limited by her weakeness in the low range, more than makes up for it with her little cadenza (\\"fanno torto a nostro onor\\") as Fiordiligi in Cosi.     I do not agree with the previous reviewers' assertions that Donna Elvira is supposed to be a strong woman.  There is no character in the opera that has made up her mind to hate Don Giovanni more than Donna Elivra, yet she immediately acquiesces to a disguised Leperello, making her weakness all that more striking. If she _was_ a strong woman, then maybe Bartoli's screeching \\"Ah! Chi mi dice mai...\\", where it looks like she is being controlled by some hidden psychotic puppeteer, yanking on her hair and skin in all directions and contorting her face into grotesque gargoylesque expressions, would be acceptable.  If anything, her performance makes you hate Donna Elivra's character and secretly hope that she will never appear again in the opera.    Roberto Sacco's performance in Don Giovanni is much improved over his Ferrando in Cosi, where he submits to Puccini-esque tenor devices.  In Giovanni, however, he is more tender and convincing. He still, does not compare to Rainier Trost as Ferrando in Gardiner's Cosi.     Isabel Rey makes the best of having to play the most annoying (but most blessed in terms of some of the most beautiful music) character in the opera.  To play someone who, everytime she says something, says the same thing \\"But my father?\\", must be tiresome.  However, she has some beautiful duets with Sacco, and I looked forward to her appearances in the opera.    Gilfry was Gilfry.  Strong and believable. No surprises.    I just hope that the Gardiner version with Organasova and Gilfry comes out in the US soon.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Love this album!  Don't know why Josh was so nervous about whether people will like it (per the \\"Making Of...\\" DVD that's included).  He can sing almost anything.  More eclectic than his previous albums--more of his personality is coming through, I think.  This, and his previous \\"Closer\\" album, are rare finds in my opinion in that I love every song on the album.  I can't say that for many others.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Outstanding movie, once you realize it is not a kids movie. (Language, situations etc...)  <br /> <br />
6305781427|5.0|No wonder this is one of the top selling videos.  This was an incredible concert--wished I had seen it live in Athens, but this way I can watch it over and over again instead of only having my memory of the event.  Love this video.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This movie is perfect for not only children but anyone who loves the story of the boy who would never grow up. It creates a beautiful interpretation of Neverland that even J.M. Barrie would appreciate.
B00070DK1E|5.0|I didn't think I would like this. I am use to the old Tull. But I gave it a chance. It is a different sound but I absolutely love it. I can't stop listening to it.
B000I5X81K|5.0|CD delivers excellent quality.....very pleasurable experience from this young artiste. Timely delivery from Amazon. Thank you very much.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  We had it in VHS and finally bought it on DVD, too.  If you haven't seen it and you have ever worked in an office, you MUST see it!  Classic.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|Missed out in the awesome wooden box from last year. <br />And settled for this guy here. I love Friends and at least I have a complete set finally.  <br />But the packing is truly disappointing. Cheap cardboard that looks like it won't last more than a few openings. 5 stars for the show. 0 stars for the packaging. <br /> <br />And the thing that really gets me is the discs are divided into 6 sets of disc holders. One holder for each Friend is cute and novel...but a failed gimmick...there are 10 freaking seasons man. It makes no sense that each season wouldn't have it's own holder or box. <br /> <br />I put on a brave smile because I got this as a gift. But I was really dissapointed with the packing. <br /> <br />They had perfection with the wooden box..why mess with it. <br />If you are purely interested in only the contents of the show...get this. If you want something that feel authentic....skip this cheap knock off and get the real deal wooden box set while it's still available at some places. <br /> <br /> <br />
0394800184|5.0|This is such a cute story!  I remember loving it as a child and now I get to read it to my 4 year old daughter and she loves it as well!
0743201140|5.0|This has been a wonderful experience for me to discover my strengths after wondering for 55 years why I was so different than my friends and family. I thought either I was weird or they were. I discovered that my first strength is winning others over. I get great energy from meeting new people. This has been something I have felt that everyone should want to do in our church on Sunday. It has always been so natural to want to meet the new visitors, but now I know that it is a gift that not everyone possesses and that I should develop. We bought copies for both our sons who were home from college this Christmas and they discovered their strengths. It is right on. Your strengths are your best shot.
B000J10ERO|1.0|The product arrived in plenty of time, but the sound on the DVD is messed up.  Great service, poor product.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite shows.  This DVD keeps the movie alive for my children.
0446528056|5.0|Excellent! Best novel from a man's point of view that I have ever read. If we only knew what actually went one inside a man's head when he seems tongue tied or unable to communicate his feelings at the appropriate moments.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this one by Nicholas Sparks one of his best. Should be made into a movie.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|Excellent young teen film, a little bit of adult language but needed for the story.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|Great Script + Great Actors = Great Movie.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is perfect for the role and the rest of the M.O.D. squad members are really fun to watch.  Perhaps the Director should consider a mini-TV series that would dwell into an episode each of the M.O.D. squad industries and a finale that would become an argueably correct movie for all ages.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I found out about this DVD from public television.  I would consider this the best DVD I have ever seen.  The light show is phenomenal.  I only wish I could have seen it in person.  The sound quality is awesome.  I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas and we consider this to be \\"the best Christmas present ever\\".  I would recommend this DVD to any fan of Pink Floyd.  I would definitely give this one 5 STARS !!!   <br /> <br />
0689870280|5.0|I gave this book to a 2 1/2 year old for christmas. She has learned to read it by herself and reads it every nite!  It is an adorable story that is funny and warm! <br /> <br />sherri
1582701709|5.0|The information coming forth in this book is to help with the ascension of human consciousness.  It brings awareness to our conscious and subconscious thoughts, which when understood a bit better, can catapult us into a new awareness, one that is powerful indeed.
1400082773|5.0|This is a well written, easy to read autobiography.  I really enjoyed learning so much about Senator Obama's life, which definitely affects the way he thinks and believes.  I hope he becomes President! KT
B000I0QK74|1.0|This is a great album. James Taylor style is at his best!. Contains no so very traditional songs performed very nicely. If you like James Taylor music, you ought to have this album.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is great for kids or adults. The color is great, the story good, and the music wonderful! I would recommend it for children of every age.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is a wonderful CD,a must have for your collection.
1932100660|5.0|\\"The China Study\\" by T. Colin Campbell is an excellent book which every American truly ought to read.  I believe its information is vital to the well being of our lives in this, our time.  I strongly recommend it to everyone to read and study.<br /><br />Yes, we as Americans keep talking about health, well-being, worries concerning what we are to do about our inflated health insurances costs and problems.  We see an ever increasing caseload per capita of medical problems, and observe the increase and spread of major diseases which are ripping into the fabric of our lives, and creating growing costs to us as a nation.<br /><br />More all the time we hear of conflicting medical reports and news.  We wonder what information is correct.  This book helps a great deal to clear up some misconceptions in dealing with these problems.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell offers a summary of excellent information and remedies for every American to consider in answering what we are to do about our medical problems, growing health concerns, and health issues in this nation and in the world.  This book simplifies the confusing medical cob web of misinformation we are confronted with in the social, commercial and political arenas of our society.<br /><br />It is well documented with excellent research references and information to back up the research studies he has been doing. It is a great summary of extensive medical research which all should be awakened to.<br /><br />The book is a real eye opener.<br /><br />This book is a must for everyone to read and act on!
B000F3TBIO|4.0|For those of you that are fans of Mike Patton or were fans of Faith No More, you'll most likely enjoy this album.
B00004R99L|5.0|Great for collectors. <br /> <br />Arrived on time and in good condition.
0143036556|5.0|Anyone interested in why we are where we are and how to learn the hard lessons from the past should read this book.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|This is a great box set for you Alias fans.  The box itself is well crafted and packed with every episode from seasons 1-5.  Each season is arranged in it's own booklet set of disks.  These flip like pages in a book.... and the dvds simply slide out of the pages.  This set is not like those other annoying dvd set holders that are like accordians and hard to keep organized.  In addition to the regular episode disk, there is a secret compartment within the set which contains a bonus dvd with hours of extra footage.  Not too mention the last disk in every season contains deleted scenes, tv specials, making of... etc. <br /> <br />The only thing I was hoping for was some kind of rambaldi artifact.  But, with all the disks in this set... they would have to call it the Rambaldi artifact trunk. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is an absolute must have if you are a die hard fan or like conspiracy theory + spy + sci-fi type thrillers.  You will definitely be hooked from the first episode to the last.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My 7 year old daughter and I had owned this CD for two weeks and had memorized every word.  Love it, love it, love it.  We are dying to see the play, but I am in the midst of reading the novel and it is much darker than the music would leave one to believe.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|My father was actually in the Grapes of Wrath in read life.  This book was very informative and very good.
0930289528|5.0|this product was shipped quickly and it was in good condition when sent. The story itself is very interesnting and really lets the reader see how the story was ment to be told when it was first written.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|We wanted to catch up on Veronica Mars for the new seasons. Loved it so much we ended up watching the whole season straight over one weekend.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter. She and I both love it.  As always, Gosh Grobin did a wonderful job!
B00000IACG|4.0|another great cd to have for a fugazi fan,  if your not familiar with this band i recomend \\"13 songs\\"  instrument is great. buy them both. the opposite of bad music
B000002UB3|5.0|it was all that i remembered from the 60's and brought back great memories. <br />also, the disk arrived promptly and the condition was excellent.
6304806418|1.0|i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the  real movie and not a musical movie.<br /><br />i'm still looking for the real real movie but still can't find it
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a fantastic buy.  I purchased it as a gift and I believe it was a great value especially for Beatles Fans!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is a valuable and important message we all need to hear. The material is presented in a way that we all can understand and cannot ignore.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Not only was this movie priced great, it was in great shape, and it arrived very quickly. I was pleasantly suprised by that, and I am fully satisfied with my purchase.
B000I5X81K|5.0|The CD was received in a very timely manner.  Packaging was excellent so there was no damage to the product.  Would definitely order CDs again through Amazon.com.
032147404X|5.0|As a beginner in digital photography, I was more than a little pleased to find Scott Kelby such an easy read for me. He made the process of setting both subjects and camera in a way that was easy to follow and I am recommending \\"The Digital Photography Book\\" to all my friends who are intrested in photography. I will be happy and eager to buy and read other books by Mr Kelby. Thanks again, DonVega
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I loved this.  I am not so much a Emmylou fan as a Mark fan, but both of them were excelent
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Love the CD ! and at such a good price, my mother-in-law loved it too !  This was a Christmas gift from my mother-in-law.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I got this DVD set for my son; he's watched it a few times and loves it. I saw the movie when it first came out- if you're into this kind of subject, it's the only classic out there!
B0002X314C|5.0|Love the CD ! and at such a good price, my mother-in-law loved it too !  This was a Christmas gift from my mother-in-law.
B000000993|5.0|As a long term Tool fan I appreciate anything the band has to offer and as I was unaware of this CD imagine my surprise when I played it for the first time, I was literally blown away, I wish I had known about it sooner!! it is definately a must for any Tool fan
0307237699|5.0|A must read, great historical review and insights for the future. <br />He has my vote.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|The dvd is great <br />Really loved the first unreleased song <br />I only wish they would have made one edition instead of selling it with 3 different bonus discs.
0618680004|5.0|I plan to wait a couple of months and then re-read this amazing book. I am in awe.... of Richard Dawkins' genius and ability to reframe complicated issues with such clarity.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Great CD...we enjoyed it all through the holidays...a nice change from the department store repetition of songs.
B000000W5P|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Stones LP's, and recently purchased it in CD form.  Still love it!
1878424319|5.0|This is a great book to give to friends to help them to plan and manage their lives!  The wisdom of Don Miguel Ruiz and his concepts can be used to help anyone to understand life goals and beliefs.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I really love the Supernatural complete first season. It one of my favorite shows that I prefer to watch. Right along with Smallville which I got all of Smallville's complete season. I can't wait for the second complete season of Supernatural comes out. For I'll purchase it along with all of their complete season when they're available and the reason I purchased the first complete season of Supernatural that I can see the shows that I possibly missed while it was on TV
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This two-disc version is a must have. The 2nd disc contains a song sung by Gerard Butler (Erik, the Phantom), that was not in the movie. But helps explain his fascination for Christine. Plus, the making of the movie and insight on the Broadway show. Really great stuff!
B00005QXDD|5.0|This is a great album. Children beware for language though.  It is JB and KG threw and threw.
1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller is one of my all time favorite writers, and this book is one of his greatest stories.  I highly recommend any Sin City book, and if you like Batman, do yourself a favor and pick up The Dark Knight Returns.  You can thank me later.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Excellent blend of old songs and new. My child loves the CD!
0618680004|5.0|This book treats Christianity pretty much as the sole world religion.  We know that's not so, but Dawes was brought up in a Christian environment, not a Muslin or a Buddhist one.  Therefore he does not care to speak with specific authority on these beliefs, even though the principals he writes about still apply. <br />   If you are a committed Christian, you may fear, or not wish, to finish this book.  If you do reach the end, you may no longer be so commited. <br />   If you are an open and declared atheist, then this book may just align your thoughts in a more organized direction. <br />   This book is really aimed at AGNOSTICS.  He asks them to re-examine their thoughts, seriously, deeply and with care.  He feels that agnosticism is fence-sitting, and an inappopriate stance for a serious book-reader.  The consecutive arguments that Dawes offers give good reasons in increasingly powerful blows why such an attitude is unreasonable. <br />   Dawes writing has an added bonus in offering numerous odd knowledges, trivia almost, to entertain the reader, and a sense of humor that takes the bitter edge off some of his points.
0300108834|5.0|This book is wonderful for anyone who is intimidated by the magnitude of information related to world history, and wants an enjoyable experience learning about the central themes and events.  The format of the book is similar to a parent reading stories to a child, with a calm and relaxing tone, but, as an adult, I didn't feel talked down to.  I particularly enjoyed listening to the book-on-CD, and then reading the text later to consolidate the information learned.  This is a great book for anyone who wants to be literate about world history, but doesn't want to read a textbook.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Great CD and fast shipping.  The price was right too.  Thanks!
B000JVRPUI|4.0|This Ultimate Collector's Edition HD DVD reminds me in a very positive way of the \\"good old laserdisc special edition\\" days wich unfortunately have gone the way of the Dodo.  Lots of special features on the disk and also lots of goodies in the metal casing.  The only minus in my humble opion is the size of robbie the robot, wich is extremly small 3,5\\" ...come on....and not very detailed, maybe Warner should have asked the guys from wetaworkshop to make a sculpture of the robot carrying the girl(like in the movieposter).  Neverheless its a grand Special Edition wich will make you enjoy this movie to the fullest.
0316172324|5.0|A must read for anyone who has or needs a clue. Facinating examples about what sets people apart as thought leaders and experts using cognitive strength. Hard to put down once you start.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh is my favorite! I love the new CD. It is in my Ipod and I listen to him and many others daily on my walks. Keep up the great work. What a voice!!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh has to be one of the most talented <br />singers that are around today....his voice <br />is fantastic!
B000H5U832|5.0|Disney PIXAR should say it all.  This may be the last of its kind with the buy out of the original Pixar animations, but this one lives up to its reputation.  It is action packed and for adults as much as children, especially anyone remotely into racing!
B000B5IPDI|4.0|I've been looking for a decent edition of this beautiful film. This is the best i've found.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is a classic disney movie with love versus evil, and of course the love prevails... My kids loved it... might be  little scary in parts, but no worse that Snow White or Beauty and the Beast.  It is a great movie to add to your Princess Collection!
0784011680|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. should have won an Oscar. I have this movie.
6305428042|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE, ITS A GREAT FAMILY FILM! I WATCH IT ALL YEAR LONG!!!
B00006F1IJ|5.0|I consider very relaxing music while I am driving going home no matter traffic jam and of course listening the CD at home with my family.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|This CD is very good. It's quite music, you can work, when you hear it! <br />My english is not so good, that i find the right words!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore provides a factual breifing of the current scientific data concerning global warming. He has taken years to study and master complex scientific studies and presents them in a cohesive and understandable way for the lay person. He presents facts without hysteria, and provides ways for each of us to help solve this imediate problem.
B000I5X81K|5.0|this music is magically!! I here she everyday! All of Josh Groban is my music!! It's the best what i hear in the last time!!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|This is one of the best mini series I've seen.  I actually had the vcr before, and the one complaint I have is that the color quality was much better in the vcr.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I discovered Grey's Anatomy a little late (the show was already in the third season), but that didn't stop me from getting hooked.  The characters are great, and Patrick Dempsey is hot.  This is definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|If you're not familiar with Carl Perkins this might be the one CD to own. He was physically in great shape (before his throat cancer) and delivered his songs with abundant energy. Many of his previous studio projects suffer from over production by well meaning producers. This is Carl at his best, captured in his element, and recorded on the best equipment of the time. With that said, one cannot miss the DVD that this CD is taken from. Get the DVD and watch one of the masters at work!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|This is a really good CD.  Funeral and Great Salt Lake are my favorite songs on the CD.  We caught the live show too, and it rocked!  :) <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Who says sophmore albums are flops? This one is up to par with the rest of their work. Very edgy and with lots of drive. A great success. You'll enjoy this one. Don't hesitate to buy.
B000BNI90O|5.0|As all other Lord of the Ring movies releases the Complete Recordings meet all the high standards set to make us feel guilty for not buying it. The hard paper case resembles an old book with leather-like cover with beautifully carved gold letters and unique artwork. <br /> <br />Open it a wonderful surprise is there for you: behind the cover is located the DVD-Audio with the complete recordings, with superb quality of sound, but the menus e.t.c. didn't exactly enthused me. The rest of the box contains the three CDs with the same material, also excellent, and a wonderful little book (leaflet would be insulting) with analysis of each track, along with parts of the music sheets. All decorated with unique artwork from the movie. The ribbon placed to easily lift the CDs from the box earns an extra star alone, but amazon.com has no 6 stars rating. <br /> <br />The music itself is fantastic. This boxset proves how complex and difficult was Howard Shore's task to score a movie based on such a versatile world as the real one. Highlights: \\"The Passing of the Elves\\" and all the Rivendell and Lothlorien related music that was cut from the OST release. <br /> <br />This is the best box containing the best material...
B00005JLEU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this animation. So much so that I purchased it to send to my sister for Christmas. Miyazaki portrays a typical 9 or 10 year old to a T and the lessons she learns from the spirit world are timeless. This is not just for children, but will enchant the children in all of us.
0688156819|5.0|my daughter loves tim burton's films, so this was the logical stocking stuffer for christmas this year. she loves it!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|If you're a die-hard fan and have been waiting for Beverly Hills 90210 to come out on dvd, then this is for you!  The first season is just as funny and great as I remember, and it's so much fun watching it again now.  A perfect gift for anyone wanting to remember the best show ever!
0670034711|5.0|I have bought 8 copies of this book and give them to all my friends.One of my all time favorite books.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Amazing! I bought it for my bro last Christmas and ended up watching the whole thing in a day before I gave it to him.
0375505091|5.0|This book was purchased for a Christmas gift and it absolutely delighted the recipient.  I was delighted that the price tag was so much less than list price.
B000066C1N|2.0|The music is right from the movie, however I was hoping for more of the instrumental music vs mainly lyrical.
B000J10ERO|4.0|It is an excellent movie.  This movie turns the Superman franchise in interesting new dimensions, and rightly ignores S3 and S4.  Worth seeing by anyone that enjoys action, adventure, and comic books adaptions.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I first heard saw this on the PBS channel. My mom knows my love of celtic type music and ordered the DVD. When the c/d came with it, I was totally excited!!  The music is incredible. The mix of artists is great. Wnen original c/d disappeared (from being listened to with me everywhere!!) I had to get a new one and came here. So if you like this c/d...... I love it..... then you need to check out \\"Walking in the Air\\" and \\"Lisa\\".  I have a large collection of celtic music and these are in my top 6.   <br />thank you
0887306101|4.0|The equities and commodities traders interviewed are real superstars.  Discussions with Paul Tudor Jones, Jim Rogers and Tony Saliba give  good background in general trading frameworks - these guys  are real trading lengends. Tudor Jones discusses taking big  positions on important market shifts like Oct 87 and Jim Rogers  discusses value investing and investing in what is out of favor  or being given away in a panic. \\"Buy panic and sell hysteria\\" he says.   The legendary William O'Neil and David Ryan discuss buying   the very best growth stocks after they come out of a period  of consolidation and when their sales and earnings are improving.  Overall a wonderful overall intro to trading
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is my husband's favorite movie!  He feels a need to watch it every Feb. 2!
B000DN5W4I|4.0|Joe Bonamassa is a great talent but I think he overdoes it on this one drawing his songs out.  I would have liked to hear more variety of his music and songs than one long drawn out version.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I didn't think Il Divo could out do themselves, but they did with Siempre. The music is up beat and the songs bring out the best that David, Urs, Carlos, and Sebastien have to offer. I bought my whole family copies of the cd and they love it as much as I do.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I love this movie!  It has all the elements I love..romance, comedy, suspense and a love that is fated to be.
B000002BSG|4.0|Although the music is somewhat \\"retro\\", (disco throwback), it's still really good listening.
1580086810|5.0|I bought this book for a friend who is a globally minded chef, and I ended up  reading it from cover to cover before I gave it to her. This book provides an  important and fascinating look at the diversity of flavors and nutrition that  families around the world consume in their normal weekly diets. Each chapter is a family that the reader comes to know by name and lifesytle making the connection of our humanity so honestly close. Subjects such as malnutrition, obesity, the effects of urbanization and fast food, are also discussed in such a way that is eye opening and comprehendable when looking at them from this global perspective. Hungry Planet is beautifully presented equally by photographs and text.
B000HEVZ8K|4.0|Very good transfer from film to HD DVD. Colors are bright and vivid without looking cartoonish. The details are clear and very natural looking. The movie itself is a classic with John Wayne in a darker role, which he plays well. The movie is well acted and directed. All in all, The Searchers is a movie worth watching, especially if you are a John Wayne fan. The fact that it is in HD DVD is just the icing on the cake. I was not born yet when the film was first released, but I imagine this version is as close to the original look and feel of the movie.
1573225517|4.0|Much better than I expected; as a fan of the movie, I was pleasantly shocked at the similarity between the two. There is a distinctly British flavor to it, but overall this was a fantastic book for music lovers and list makers.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I ordered the movie, got the movie in 5 days as planned, good condition,
B00014TJ7K|5.0|An excellent piece of work....heads above his contemporaries....except for the \\"Traveling Willburys\\"
B000065BPB|4.0|For $73, these headphones are a good deal.   <br />-I would consider them to be comperable with Grado SR80s.  <br /> <br />Audiophiles talk about burn ins or using monster cables or rubbing snake oil on cables or whatever such idiocy, disregard that.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't use these in a studio, for serious reference, or for djing (I don't think that the plastic would hold up as well as even as the sony marketed dj headphones). The Sd-280s headphones are also larger (wider cans and huge head loop) than I wish they were.   <br /> <br />It's worth noting that the single coil 1/8\\" stereo cable isn't easily assessable for replacement.  However, again, a good deal for $73.  <br /> <br />The headphones are responsive enough for most music, but the limitations are audible.

B000HCO840|3.0|no surprise ... good effects ... the rise and fall of Jean Grey ... <br />just making us wait for the next ... if there is one ... and we all know the story ...
1401384145|4.0|Overall this is an excellent selection.  I purchased the audio book rather than the hardcover book.  I'm glad I did as this book I would think would be rather difficult to read just by its shear volume and the \\"50 dollar words\\" that are used throughout the audio.  It opened my eyes and actually gave me an idea to start my own blog ([...]) based on the book.  I did that so I could try and bring the idea down to the layman's level of understanding.  One thing for sure the idea hits the nail directly on the head.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is one of our favorite family Christmas movies.  We purchased this particular edition for the karaoke, coloring pages, games, and activities that were offered.  I really didn't think my kids would be very interested in the games, but to my surprise they loved them.  Even now after Christmas, we find ourselves using lines from the movie.  Maybe it's a little corny, but it always brings a smile! <br /> <br />I recommend this edition to anyone who just can't get enough of Buddy the Elf!
0446528056|5.0|This a must have by Sparks! <br />Good shipping time and exactly how described.
B000056HE9|5.0|My brother has been bugging me for years to see this movie.  Rather than renting it I decided it must be good enough to own.  It definitly is.  My 9 and 6 year old were bummed when Mom turned on a black-and-white movie.  They started playing with some of their toys but 20 minutes into the movie, they were on the couch with us cuddled in for the rest of it.  It is a great value story.  I'm sure it will be a Christmas classic in our house.
B000003N7R|4.0|How can I say anything negative about two of the greatest jazz musicians who ever lived.  The music was subperb. <br /> <br />Amazon sent me this CD in a most timely fashion.  All went smoothly.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|I'm 36 and like many, I got really tired of hearing Bruce's few good songs from the 80's.  My interests shifted to more folky stuff, and then Bruce followed along with this amazing album!  The sounds are raw and full of energy.  The worst songs on the album are ok and the best (e.g., Dan Tucker) are just out of this world.  If you liked Billy Bragg's Mermaid Avenue set, this will really get you going.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Another great album by Incubus! This band has had many successful albums so to make another one takes talent.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige works on many levels, as a character study and a depiction of rivalry and revenge, as a period piece that illuminates the ingenuity and sacrifice and risk required to carry off the trickery and deception of stage magic.  It is a very entertaining film, that captivated my attention throughout, was very well acted (especially by Christian Bale) and very well paced.  It is, moreover, a film that does not commit the usual crime of Hollywood films of dumbing things down for its audience.  Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who obviously respects his audience, expects them to be capable of piecing things together, and doesn't lay everything out.  (A recent film that is guilty of this sin is \\"Lucky Number Slevin\\" which was very entertaining but would have been much more interesting if the directors didn't feel the need to explain everything that anyone who had been paying attention would have already gotten, in great detail in the concluding scenes).  Most interesting, I think, is the ending of the film, an ending many other reviewers take to have been a kind of fraud or cop out.  As I read the film, the director uses this ending very deliberately to call attention to his own manipulation of audience expectations in the preceding parts of the film.  While the methods of the \\"magic\\" in the end evoke horror and disgust, they in fact serve only as a grotesque mirror of the sacrifice required by the trickery that is depicted throughout.  In hindsight, the ending can be seen to be prefigured by a very early scene in which we see how a bird is made to disappear and reappear.  We accept and admire the skill and sacrifice and risk of the artists to a point -- but only when we have the security that in the end none of it is real.  We want to suspend disbelief, but would be horrified if we truly believed.  At some level, I think this functions as an intriguing reflection on what audiences want in film: we tend to want what we see to be as realistic as possible without crossing a line to make us believe it is really real -- brutal and bloody depictions of gratuitous violence are okay, and the more lifelike the better, but images of actual violence drawn from contemporary wars generate outrage.  A film that can simultaneously do the job of being slick and entertaining, and at the same time raise intriguing and profound questions about the nature of entertainment, and of audience expectations, and of the relation between image and reality is definitely worth a look.  I know I'll be seeing it again.ossing a line to make us believe it is really real -- brutal and bloody depictions of gratuitous violence are okay, and the more lifelike the better, but images of actual violence drawn from contemporary wars generate outrage.

B00004XQ83|5.0|Perhaps it's something in the blood (I am, after all, a born and bred Southerner, and this movie was filmed in my home state). But this soundtrack is beyond fabulous thanks to the superb playing of an array of stringed instruments. It is always in the car, and I play it on a loop whenever I take a long road trip; certain tracks seem to make you feel you're moving more quickly than you actually are. I cannot comment on the technical skills of the musicians. I don't even like this genre of music as a rule. But there's something about this collection of tunes, something about the execution, that is true and pure and wonderfully uplifting. It also may have something to do with the movie and the fact that it is one of my all-time favorite films. If you like bluegrass and/or early 20th century music, this is for you.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Realy nice mix with a new take on some classic Christmas songs and her new work.
B000GY729M|5.0|It is such a beautiful CD. <br />Of course, CD's cover design is awesome, and the Killers' music is priceless!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This has to rate as among the best concerts of all time. The performances are all truly masterful. Sam Browns vocals stand out and are truly awe inspiring. Gilmore's lead of the band is as professional as any philharmonic conductor. He changes timing and tone with simple gestures. His solo performances in comfortably numb are monumental. He is one of the very few artists who are able to convey real emotion into their music. Nick Mason shows his mastery of the percussions and Richard Wright's keyboards carry the effective resonance throughout especially in the dark side of the moon sequences.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'm sure there are a few people who don't appreciate the humor in this movie, but I don't know any of them.  THe characters are hilarious and I had to buy another dvd because mine was borrowed and never returned.  We have all watched this numerous times in my house.  Everyone knows a Napolean Dynamite in high school, or was him!
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|The original CD is GREAT by itself, but with the bonus CD of live tracks and B sides is an extra bonus.  This album just totally ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
1582701709|5.0|The author writes in such a fashion so \\"it\\" is easy to remember and also to apply in everyday life; also, an easy reference to use--open to any page and find just what you need.  The \\"secret\\" strategy for everyday life (once learned) is just a matter of application.  We all have the power . . . we just needed to know the art of \\"how to accomplish\\" what is already within us!! <br />
0375751513|5.0|A book for all time. This is a piece we could all use to search the places in our souls that need careful review and study. Probably Oscar Wilde's greatest work that continues to live on.
074356619X|5.0|Excellent program.  I have added it to the top drawer of my CD library.
B000FILW86|4.0|After all these years Cheap Trick continues to churn out ear pleasing rock-n-roll. \\"Rockford\\" is no exception. I keep hearing how this cd rates to their last \\"great\\" release, 1997's \\"Cheap Trick\\", and it's a good comparison, but in my opinion \\"Rockford\\" wins out. The '97 cd is great, but it's a little dark and uneven. But Rockford, whoa Nellie ..... it's fantastic, cut to cut. From the bombastic opening of \\"Welcome to the World\\" to the other 11, it's sweet rock for any music fan. Some folks might not even realize these guys are still putting out excellent music, but fans who have followed the group know they continue to please. If you haven't picked up a CT cd in a while, buy this one. Then maybe, like myself, you'll go back into their catalog and repurchase more of their stuff. CT to this day rocks and that's really all that matters!
B000H5U832|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!!! I am not a car lover, but a disney lover and I am 24 years old. I hope that one day when I have kids, they will enjoy it too. Please, buy this. Trust me, you will love this!
0743289412|4.0|In some ways this book is mistitled, because even though we see everything through Lisey, the title character, the story really belongs to Scott, Lisey's deceased novelist husband.  Lisey's struggles, even her torture at the hands of a maniac, never achieve the intensity of Scott's, and even when she faces the demons, she faces them second-hand:  they are really Scott's demons, after all.  (Of course, this being a Stephen King story, Scott's demons are REAL creatures, very nasty looking indeed.) <br /> <br />On the other hand, the book does raise up Lisey.  It shows the true story of her and Scott's relationship and how most of his success really belongs to her behind-the-scenes actions.  This book reveals the story that only Scott and Lisey know, and that Lisey herself has not fully acknowledged until now.  In that way, the tale becomes a tribute to wives in general and, I suspect, to King's wife in particular.  It is fitting that he dedicates the book to Tabitha King. <br /> <br />For those who only care about horror and suspense, this book has plenty.  But even more, the book has sadness.  The sadness of loss, inevitable loss, loss that cannot be conceived by those who have not loved deeply.  As in so many of King's books, love is active here:  strengthening, healing, redeeming.  Love shines through the darkness and sweetens the moments of sorrow. <br /> <br />A tender tribute and a good read.
B0009WQ3P0|5.0|I really love this collection.  It's not a greatest hits collection, although a good effort was made to select the best material.  It is an anthology, giving an overview of many of the personalities, musical styles, and high-points of this incredibly durable band.  The tracks are not organized chronologically.  I really like this feature:  I think significant effort was put into the choice and the order of the material; and it flows nicely.<br /><br />Four discs, 72 tracks, including 4 new songs, 5 unreleased songs, 2 live and unreleased songs, and 9 alternative mix songs, so 28% of the total is not what was on the released albums and singles.  And the alternative material sounds great.  (I don't have the remastered Fleetwood Mac and Rumours albums (yet), so some of this might be redundant.)  My favorite FM album is Tusk; but I also like Rumours, Fleetwood Mac, the Bob Welch records, and much of the Peter Green phase.  (I think the Burnette/Vito period is the least interesting.)<br /><br />The first disk is dominated by Mirage, Tango in the Night, and Behind the Mask material.  Disc 2 is dominated by Rumours, Mirage, and Tusk material.  Disc 3 is dominated by Tusk and Fleetwood Mac (white album) material with some Bob Welch era.  Disc 4 is dominated by Peter Green era and Bob Welch era material.  I think the Bob Welch material gets short shrift, as well as Tusk.  The set was released during the Burnette/Vito period and that's reflected in (in my opinion) an unrepresentative helping of that material.  The thing that amazes me is how good it all sounds.  Mick and John are just rocks (pun intended) behind whoever is out front.  The breadth and depth of the material is amazing.  Some complain about too much emphasis on the Buckingham/Nicks period.  It's not possible to do otherwise.  Although the Peter Green era produced more albums (7 vs. 6), the bands success, financially and (in my opinion) creatively, peaked in the Rumours/Tusk period.  It's also the most long-lived lineup.  What else is to be expected with 3 songwriters of the stature of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie?<br /><br />It's a bit hard to find (long out of print) but I located a like-new copy (perfect for a except cutout slice) on ebay express for $38.  Well worth the effort and the money.  It appears to still be in print in the UK.  Check Amazon UK for a listing.  It's fairly expensive, and shipping will be as well.  Enjoy.ived lineup.

This is one of the most helpful audio programs I have listened to all year. And I listen to lots of them. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is truly serious about achieving their goals.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie is great. Great family movie, My kids and I loved it.  There are games on it also, my son loves tractor tipping. Now my son wants everything Cars.
1400079276|4.0|Not as engrossing as some of Murakami's other writings.  I'm biased though, unjustifiably I think he is a better short story writer than he is a novelist...much like Lahiri.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This is a great addition on any collection.  The packaging is very well done.  The DVD has exceptional visual quality.  A lot of information about the movie and how it started it all for true outer space science fiction.

B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter has always loved this movie. We have had it on VHS for several years and have just recently bought it on DVD. It's great. It's a movie the whole family will enjoy. That's good--because if your kids are like mine, they will watch it over and over.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Great Song and Dance with stars of yesteryear.......what a way to get into the spirit.  We played it for our Christmas open house and on other occasions.. Everyone really enjoyed it.  Great for company, especially older relatives that may be visiting over the holidays....they will remember and enjoy!  Nothing commercial out this CD.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|This is a really excellent performance of this moving opera. Not only the music performance which is really outstanding (actually perfect) but also the acting is unbelievable. This is a must have for any one who loves opera.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I loved this movie.  It provided a glimpse of the world as it might have truly been, and captured the sentiment of a people living in harsh conditions.  How might our ancestors have viewed other humans who looked or behaved differently, how might they have viewed other humanoids? <br /> <br />The lack of hollywood sentiment are what hooked me on this version.  It was raw, believable, felt true to period, not over the top, and the acting was amazing!
B000I5X81K|5.0|nice variety of songs- haven't stopped listening to it since we got it. Love the songs in Italian!
0140157352|5.0|Excellent book. I highly recommend it. Getting to Yes gets to the point. It is thorough but doesn't waste words. It is an essential tool for understanding the myriad situations we all find ourselves in at our work and in our everyday lives. The authors simplify the tools but also address the complexities and all the reality questions that come to mind, such what if they.....  Excellent book. I highly recommend it whether you ever engage in formal negotiations or not.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This album is somewhat different from Josh's other ones, but some of his best work is on this album, too. You Are Loved is probably the highlight of this album for me. The first ten tracks are very similar to his previous albums, but Josh explores a bit with the last couple tracks.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I took my children and their families to see it after I saw it twice.  I bought DVDs when it came out and gave them to friends and family for Christmas.  For at least 20 years, the environmentalists have been trying to tell people and governments about global warming; it is perhaps a bit bittersweet that Al Gore finally gets the world's attention with this vital documentary--but certainly none too soon!  The subject is the most important in our world today, but the documentary itself is extremely well done, well paced and interesting to watch.  They even made sure that the production and the products were carbon-neutral!  I was fascinated by the packaging--very environmentally sound!  And Native Energy donations are an excellent way to offset or reduce your carbon footprint.  For people who are just beginning to notice, this is a wonderful introduction.  For those of us who are already working in the direction of sustainability and carbon and oil reduction, it is an inspiration.  I am deeply grateful that this documentary was made! <br /> <br />The only lack in the movie is specific concrete suggestions for individual action.  There are some, but they are at the very end while the credits roll!  We need lots more ideas that each of us can implement, especially the less expensive ones.  It would be good to have a beginner's list, an intermediate list, and an expert list!  (At one of the showings I went to, a list of ten things was handed out--that was good, but not everyone got one.) <br /> <br />The really great thing about some of the solutions to global warming is that they solve several problems at once--for example, if you stop shopping for anything frivolous (or at the intermediate level, stop shopping for anything at all that isn't necessary), you will help the unbalance of our global fiscal situation, slowing the drain of American dollars going out of the country.  Simultaneously, you will be helping to lessen the use of oil, which is now over the peak of easy production, to reduce atmospheric carbon, to keep landfills from filling, and to save yourself some money!  In the metropolitan area I live in, traffic is a huge problem.  Freeway construction takes a long time, and they fill as they are built, so that's no solution.  Mass transit also takes years to construct, and often is not adequate to people's needs.  Want to cut traffic in half in one day, and also cut air pollution in half, and save yourself some significant money?  Carpool with just one other person!  This will also reduce the expense of road surface maintenance, by the way, and lessen the cursed potholes! <br /> <br />Of course--you can tell!--I strongly recommend this movie!  If you have heard from the radio voices--who ARE these people?  What are their scientific credentials??--that global warming is not happening, or a hoax, or whatever they are saying, you truly owe it to yourself to see this movie, at the very least--and do some personal research from there.  There are many excellent websites on climate change and interconnected matters.  There are also many action groups that we all can join; it WILL take all of us! <br />Gloria Purcell
B000AYEL1A|2.0|The 1976 remake starring Barbra Streisand is dated, corny and toatlly enjoyable. It's hard to tell if I loved it due to nostalgia, or because it's fun seeing the way she looked in the mid seventies. That voice, those clothes (from her closet due to budget reasons, right) and that afro. Jon Peters produced the movie and her hair...if you like Babs, you'll love revisiting this entertaining remake.

B00005JNS0|4.0|After seeing the initial trailers I thought to myself that is going to be the first Pixar movie I am not going to like. But I was wrong. Even though the story is fairly unoriginal, the characters, the music, the incredible combination of human/car animation all make up for it. It may not be the Incredibles, but it's still Pixar at its best.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Too bad that the ratings were low. I would have liked to see this still be on TV.
B00005MP58|5.0|Love the book, love this movie version!  Be prepared to sit through the entire 2 discs once you press play--you won't want to stop until you've made it to the end!  The casting is wonderful, the cinematography fantastic.  A lovely period piece!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I really liked the series (Firefly). Why Joss whedon decided to kill off some characters in the movie is beyond me. I think that when you have an ensemble cast that you put the writing effort in to make them click as a team you should keep them. It probably shows the writers ran out of ideas.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this for my grandson & watched it with him...it was great!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This was not doom and gloom as I thought it was going to be. It opened my eyes to what is going on. I hope that enough people see this so that the special interest groups who would rather have you stick your head in the sand and ignore this are quieted once and for all. The movie didn't say we are doomed. It just says things will change drastically. The outcome of which we can't foresee. Unless we do something to slow this down now.

I highly recommend it -- there are so many items and characters on a page that today's kids won't get bored of it. And the artwork is lovely. I've bought this book many times.

B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather has always been one of my favorites. With it's star studded cast and outstanding performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan, \\"The Godfather\\" is a hit again.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|I discovered Lubitsch's oeuvre as a teenager and since then he has remained one of my favourite movie directors. Great plans, suggested sexual innuendo in the perfect European way with lots of (not obvious) puns, a quality of photography that makes the light around the actors shine like a halo, integrating Shakespeare's texts in the plot of the 1939 invasion of Poland is a coup de maitre! The movie was made during the war itself and as such, is a strong denunciation of the enemy, probably stronger than the more \\"in-your-face/full-of-blood\\" classic war movies. Lubitsch must have been a great optimist and even his earlier and rarely seen or acknowledged \\"Broken Lullaby\\" (about World War 1), which is maybe his only \\"tragedy\\" movie, keeps the hope alive.<br /><br />My children, age 11 and 17, who had never ever watched a Black and White movie (how prehistoric!) loved To Be or Not To Be. I am hopeful that they will show this classic to their own children too.
B000006Z1X|2.0|I'm a big Graham Bonnet fan and as a guitarist, I love Steve Vai. However, this is just a mediocre album. Not one song stands out, including the opener \\"God Blessed Video\\", which got some airplay on MTV. It's a decent song, but nothing memorable. Track #5, \\"Desert Diamond\\" is an attempt at an epic piece, but is just missing something. It could have been special. You could listen to this entire album and not have one melody stuck in your head. On the positive side, Graham Bonnet sounds great, and Steve Vai has a few good solos. However, the previous Alcatrazz album with Yngwie blows this away. <br /> <br />Best song: 5. Desert Diamond
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son loved this movie so I was happy to receive it very quickly before Christmas.
B00012BD0S|5.0|Symphony X's finest moment is right here, one of those albums where you press play (or whatever your mp3 player uses as a play button) and let it flow. Even the 20-minute plus title track is excellent, and keeps you interested all the way. I'm a fan of power/prog metal, and I own the catalogues of bands like Dream Theater, Artension, Stratovarius, etc. This is my favorite of the bunch. <br /> <br />Best song: 2. Sea of Lies
0060776757|5.0|You can't get any better than this, words and pictures straight from the band members themselves
B00006L83N|4.0|First off, this is a very good album, probably my 2nd favorite CD of the band beside \\"Divine Wings.....\\". The opening track Inferno (Unleash The Fire) might be one of the best power (not prog) metal songs of all-time, as Russell Allen sings his arse off. The Accolade II is better than the first (off of \\"Divine Wings.....\\"), in my opinion. The re-make of Masquerade is infinitely better than the original, off of their first album. The title track is obviously very long, but is brilliant in some spots, and keeps your interest all the way through.  <br /> <br />Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know there is a Japanese issue of this CD which has a 10th song, titled \\"Frontiers\\". It is very hard to find, but the song is nothing to write home about.
0679805273|5.0|Oh, the Places You'll Go! touched me deeply, nudging me to remember to dream, to act with joy and to live fully in a way I had almost forgotten.  A perfect book for those starting out in life, it is equally, poignantly. necessary for those of us apporaching the second half of life, that time known Bibically as Jubilee.  New beginnings happen every day and we need to care for these sprouts with deserved tenderness and delight.  Youth may be wasted on the young, but anticipation and realized hope fit themselves into each life, expanding, stretching and liberating us to all that we can be at any age, any time.  There are so many places left for each of us to go if we give ourselves the chance to believe in ourselves over and over again.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this film!  Richard Armitage is great in it.  It is such a shame that he is not in more films.   <br />This rendition of Elizabeth Gaskell's book of the same title shows one woman's struggle to understand the vast differences between life in the north and south of England.  Her struggle to overcome her conflicting feelings about Mr. Thornton are very similar to Elizabeth Bennett's struggle to finally know and understand Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice.  If you like period films and enjoy the suspense of wondering if two people will ever end up together then you will love this film.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|I watched most of the episodes on tv.  The collection is that same as on tv but with out the commercails.  It is much better since you do not have to wait a week to see the next episode.  If you liked the series you will like the collection.  If you like undercover CIA type of shows you will really enjoy this collection as well.  I can watch every episode back to back non stop if I did not have to sleep or work.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|I would enjoy most anything ML does, but the original is a tough act to follow,
B000I5X81K|5.0|Another fine production by Josh, slightly more modern than his other recordings, equally as brilliant...........
B00005JNS0|5.0|The first few minutes of CARS I thought to myself, \\"Another boring kids' movie I have to sit through.\\"  I am not a big NASCAR fan and it seemed like the racing just went on and on.  Then the leading car of the film, \\"Lightning McQueen\\", anxious to make it to California for THE BIG RACE, finds himself stuck in an old town off of Route 66.  From that point on I was hooked.  This is my favorite Pixar/Disney film, in fact one of the top ten films I saw all year (2006).  I love all the characters and fell in love again with Paul Newman playing an old Hudson Hornet!  It had a wonderful message for kids and adults.  I think I might even become a NASCAR fan!  I am definitely a \\"Cars\\" fan!!
B000J103X4|3.0|This album seems to date back to the rap of the 90's- with sound similarities to many of Dr. Dre's songs. Nonetheless, it's pretty good.
0571202284|5.0|I would give more stars but it only allow 5!!<br /><br />Really, exelent book for anyone wanting to learn more about animation , I dare to say that if you don`t have this book you are not an animator!<br /><br />peace
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I don't think they could could make a bad cd. My only regret is I wanted more. When it was over I was waiting for more. I guess I'm just greedy.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We bought Blockus for my 6 year old for Christmas & my entire family has enjoyed the game.  It was one of the 2 biggest hits for Christmas but one that is quick & easy to learn for all ages.  The adults are still trying to stratagize while my 6 year old is just happy to be able to play something with them.  I would highly recommend it to children of all ages from 5 up!  If I have the opportunity I may buy the travel blockus just so we can take it on the road.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie didn't surprise me as I've been aware of global warming and its affect on Mother Earth for years.  I found Al Gore's presentation to be incredibly insightful, well researched, and excellently presented.  We can choose to ignore the message with all manner of excuses.  However, this is a very serious matter and an extremely important message for those who value life on all levels.
B000HJBPHG|5.0|Four interviews including Lynch and Watts, behind the scenes, music video for I've Told Every Little Star, photo gallery of publicity stills, trailer, booklet  (which hsa the European style poster image), and chapter stops throughout the movie (the U.S. edition has only one chapter). NOTE: this was an official dvd release.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I bought this friends collection series as a christmas gift for my girlfriend. It is one of her favorite things she has ever recieved. All she does is watch it. She loves this very much it was a great buy.
006054094X|5.0|This is one of those books that stands Western Civilization courses on their head. A well-researched and empirical study of how a chinese admiral, not Magellan, circumnavigated the world. In addition to the sheer \\"weight\\" of the study's facts and evidentiary assumptions, the book is well written and reads smoothly for a historical tome. It's much the style of David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose. What's even more convincing is that the authoris a sailor, a former submariner, so his knowledge of currents, winds and navigation charts gives the book an interesting and unusual perspective, in much the same way that the psychiatrist Erik Erikson contributed to our knowledge of Martin Luther via a pyschoanalytical approach to history. That an amateur historian could produce such an engaging history is as exceptional as the Chinese navigators about whom he writes.
B0000041Z6|5.0|Beautifully reproduced. I say that because I also had CDs of these performances before they were reproduced for this collection. Absolutely warm and human interpretations by Solti. Thanks for putting this all together. <br />
0618680004|5.0|Este livro fornece um bom arranque para quem queira entrar no campo das ideias ateístas. O autor oferece uma abordagem científica ao problema da criação e discute a hipótese de não haver um criador. Este é um tema bastante atual na sociedade americana mas também é pertinente um pouco por todo o mundo, já que alguns aspectos das doutrinas religiosas insistem em confrontar principalmente a evolução e, por cansequência, a metodologia científica com uma série de argumentos que vão desde a discussão das fronteiras da ciência, até à intenciaonal má interpretação de factos e teorias. No livro o autor desmonta uma série dos mais famosos argumentos criacionistas e ainda oferece uma reinterpretação do papel das escrituras das principais religiões monoteístas nas sociedades em que se inserem.
078681859X|5.0|I'm reading this book right now, and it just captures your attention.  It is a very creative book about magicians and dijinis that is also very unique.  Good read.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Although the special effects are somewhat primitive, the sense of drama that is created as the secret, left-behind machinery and technology of this ancient civilization are revealed, are mesmerizing. Or at least they are to me, at the age of 54, years after having seen this for the first time on a small B&W television. More dated are the sexual innuendos, and, of course, the references to alcohol.
0321127420|5.0|I haven't been able to read it cover to cover, but i read the mapping chapter and it was good. Explain a complex subject in relly simple way. <br /> <br />Also the hard cover is nice!
0805047905|4.0|Although a bit dated (the \\"teacher\\" is a spinster-type with a bun and glasses), this is an excellent book for learning about colors.  The repetition is a plus for working on prediction skills.  My daughter loves the vibrant illustrations!
0375413405|5.0|I purchased this volume after reading Julia Child's My Life in France, a wonderful memoir of the dynamic and driven gourmette.  The recipes in the book are simple yet complex and her style of writing makes you feel as though she is standing in the kitchen next to you, guiding you through each step.  I highly recommend the book for any person interested in learning more about French cooking, it is indeed a \\"must-have\\" resource.
1586210661|5.0|I enjoyed the audio version during a recent long road trip. David's narration and wit were a great companion. His are mature reflections and writings -- not for teenagers.
0596101996|5.0|Eventhough I just bought the book and I'm read first few chapters this book is very well structured, a good companion, definitely a book that one must have if you're planning to work on client side. <br /> <br />It is divided clearly into chapters (so you know exactly what is going) easy to follow and as well easy to jump whenever you feel that you need something in particular at later stage. <br /> <br />Concise writing (I don't like some authors that spend more time on writing about what they do on the weekends rather that on topic), it is 5th edition this clearly shows how long this book has lasted a clear evidence of quality. <br /> <br />I like in general books from O'Rielly. <br />
0060589469|5.0|My brother read it on one day and loves it. He's already re-reading the book and he's only had it a month. Great for 'deep-thinkers' and 'spiritually curios'.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Without doubt this is one of the best Queen performances ever...!!! A must see for Queen fans (and even those who are not....)!!
B000BKDOCA|3.0|I bought it to use at the gym for my running. Two or three songs are perfect for motivation, however some of the other songs are slow and awkward to work out to
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Based on the same \\"travel to different worlds\\" concept as SG-1, but different enough to prevent that \\"seen it before\\" feeling. Definately worth watching.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I bought one of these for for my sister and one for me, and I wish I'd bought more.  Oh, well, next Christmas!  Really good stuff on the entire CD.  His version of 'Who Comes This Night?' is my new favorite Christmas song.  Natalie Cole is a great choice for 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'.  Overall, a nice variety of songs and styles. <br /> <br />He's definitely still got it.  :o))
B000H5U832|5.0|My husband and I bought movie for our two year old son for Christmas!!! We loved it however our son watches the beginning and the end pretty much!!!
B000001FDQ|5.0|This album is an absolute gem in the genre of prog metal.  Virtuoso guitar throughout and excellent playing by all members of the band.  Touches of classical music interspersed with rock make this a highly recommended prog rock album.  I wish that it were all instrumental though. But there are only two vocal cuts on the whole C.D. <br />
B00000DFSK|5.0|The cream of the crop.  After reading other helpful reviews on AMAZON, <br />I decided this one would be better for me than the recent POP tunes <br />this band has been recording.  And since I received it, I've played it <br />many, many times and enjoy it more each time. <br />
B000AARKOO|5.0|In the tradition of previous masterworks such as BEN-HUR and QUO VADIS, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN touches on a multiple layer of themes...from faith to familial love to honor--even when dealing with one's so-called foe. <br /> <br />It goes without that saying that Ridley Scott's direction is yet another addition to an already distinguished resume.  He manages to tell several stories without gratituous battle or sex scenes.  Despite the epic scale, the viewer is left with an intimate look into the lives of more than one tortured soul.  The spectacular Moroccan backdrop, opulent sets and costumes support the ambience which could easily have been lost in a wash of Hollywood-typical gore and garishness. <br /> <br />Leading an impeccable cast which includes Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson and although he receives no screen visuals, the fabulous Edward Norton as King Baldwin, Orlando Bloom more than fulfills his commitment as Balian-- turning in a quiet, well-paced but intense portrayal of what, on the surface, appears to be a uncomplicated character. <br /> <br />This film, sadly underrated due to less-than-adequate marketing finesse, is definitely a must-see for devotees of a classic epic.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This short story actually brought tears to my eyes! Beautifully done. Excellent animation, different from the modern look of the computer animation. A nice change from all the modern holiday films out today.  <br />Highly recommended for family gatherings.
B00005JKG9|2.0|This movie had some of the greatest actors I have ever seen.  The acting was flawless, but I cannot give such good reviews for the screenplay and directing.  The dialogue was horrible, and the movie was very slow.  If you like slow movies that go no where, then this is the movie for you.  Otherwise, I don't believe you should buy this.  I bought this movie thinking it would be absolutely great considering Al Pacino was in it.  But, despite all the fantastic acting something was desperately lacking.  Maybe you can sit through the entire movie because of the great cast, but if any other actors (who weren't well known) were in this movie, everyone would think it was horrible.  I can't seem to dissagree more with some of the reviews that rate this movie 5 stars.  Not to mention that the ending was horrible.  But, how can you end a movie if it hasn't even began to interest you?  Perhaps the only people that would be interested in this film are people in real estate, but surely even they can tell a good movie from a bad one.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I've seen quite a few not-so-stellar reviews of this album. Personally, I think Sarah could sing the phone book, and it would be phenomenal. <br /> <br />She covers Joni Mitchell's The River on this album, and again does a great job with her material (she also did Blue).
0743201140|5.0|This book was great.  It is not meant to define who you are, but to assist you in gaining insight to your personal strengths and how you can use those to succeed in anything, career, education, relationships and life..
B000F6YPNW|5.0|Few albums have had greater impact than John Mayall's 1966 landmark \\"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton.\\" Released by the Decca label in Britain on 22 July 1966, literally days after Clapton left the Bluesbreakers and just a week before Cream's debut, it went all the way to #6, a pretty mean feat, since Mayall's band had never had a hit single. This may have been a first in Britain. <br /> <br />Of course, this is the album that set the blues and guitar worlds aflame and established Eric Clapton's name worldwide as the most passionate of musical interpreters. If you haven't yet heard \\"Beano\\" -- as it is affectionately known, because Clapton is pictured reading a \\"Beano\\" comic book on its cover -- then you ain't heard nuthin' yet! This is the stuff of legends. <br /> <br />From the album's first notes, you realize that you're in guitar heaven, as \\"Slowhand\\" shows us the way electric guitar can and should be played. Clapton's virtuoso playing is white hot throughout. Playing with a maturity beyond his 21 years, the young Eric Clapton so influenced the guitar world that Gibson eventually reissued the Les Paul model -- out-of-production since 1960 -- which Clapton then played. <br /> <br />John Mayall's Bluesbreakers served -- and serves still today -- as a finishing school for great musicians and sidemen (Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Walter Trout, Coco Montoya, John McVie, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Mick Fleetwood and others). Mayall's proselytizing the blues (he's 73 years old!), his songwriting skills, and his other musical talents should not be ignored nor taken lightly. <br />
0316236551|5.0|I love this book and Ed Emberley!  He makes the pictures so easy to draw and my children both at home and at school LOVE to follow along with me and draw these cute pictures.
B000H30B2C|5.0|The missing bits were really missed by this lover of the old King Kong.  <br />I was so glad to see these scenes in the extended edition. For those who think this film is too long I won't try to sell you on those missing parts because I think only those of us who knew they were there, and what they were, could really appreciate them. Also, you had the option of buying the theatrical cut instead, so why anyone would complain about the additional scenes is a mystery to me.  <br />The story was even more poignant for me because of the added texture the extended scenes added to the profoundly violent and deadly nature of Skull island. This was a place that killed you or scarred you, and it explains very well the extreme lifestyle adopted by the islanders. Despite all the horror and tragedy we see Denham as an exploiter in this cut. He's not be sympathized and he deserves the fate he's handed for his arrogance and his greed. He's oddly a likable person but he's also clearly flawed, and perhaps beyond redemption. What I like about this new version of Kong is the fact that at it's heart it feels like the same movie that Willis O'Brien made all those years ago. Peter Jackson, however, considered his audience and decided not just to WOW! them but also to educate them on the world of movie adventure. His message rings lod and clear; adventure, even on film, is not glamorous and it is rarely fun. In this case, it is lethal. Ironically Kong comes through as the lone survivor of his kind on Skull Island and it's is that staid life in 'civilization' that is more savage than he can cope with. In the end not only beauty killed the beast, but, also, the greed and fear that is ever apparent in the world of human beings.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|A few years ago when the new Battlestar Galactica (referred from now on as 'BSG') miniseries aired I watched it, being the SciFi fan that I am. I wasn't around for the original series, so I wasn't a fan of the show already. I thought the miniseries was ok; but wasn't overly excited when the series was announced. Since it was on right after Stargate, I decided to start watching. After a few episodes, I was hooked. What did it, if the characters and setting were the same as the miniseries? The music. <br /> <br />Nothing against Richard Gibbs (composer of the miniseries' soundtrack) but I found Bear McCreary's take on BSG to have a lot of energy and variety. My favorite tracks are some of the more off-the-wall ones, such as the lamenting bagpipes of \\"Wander My Friends\\" or the vocals in \\"Battlestar Operatica.\\" Other faves include the US & UK \\"Main Titles,\\" the modern touch of \\"Battlestar Muzaktica,\\" and the ominous tones of \\"Passacaglia\\" and \\"The Shape Of Things To Come.\\" <br /> <br />If you're not a fan of the series, a lot of the meaning may be lost on you, but if you're a fan of SciFi music, you should check it out. For those of you who are fans of BSG, the soundtrack is a great way to enjoy the show while you're driving, working at your computer, or doing other things that prohibit you from actually watching it; definitely pick it up.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is an excellent family movie with great values and morals.  It is a feel good movie with a nice story line.  Even at 50 I still shed tears at the end!
B0000024JN|5.0|this was fun to listen to. it takes us back to a time when life was less stressful and music was more enjoyable. Enjoy!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|It looked fine..but was a gift..so do not know the quality of film yet.
0307346609|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Not a \\"horror\\" novel per se. (not like, say Stephen King) It's written as if the events actually occurred and the \\"author\\" compiled a bunch of personal interviews from survivors/participants in the war, giving their different perspectives. It's pretty interesting and I enjoyed the \\"true to life\\" aspect of it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this movie! Jim Henson is a genius. All of the little puppets were so lifelike. And the music is great!
B000H5U832|5.0|WITH ALL THE GIRL MOVIES OUT THERE I AM GLAD THEY HAVE ONE FOR THE BOYS.THIS IS THE CUTEST MOVIE AND IT IS SO SO FUNNY MY BOYS LOVE IT.WE BOUGHT IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND BY CHRISTMAS WE HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE TO PUT IN THE CAR TO WATCH.I LOVE IT AS A ADULT AND THE BOYS LOVE IT TOO.ITS REALLY A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL AGES.
0743289412|5.0|This book was so good. I could not put it down , what a Love Story !!I started reading it on Monday and I was done with it by Sat. Could not put down took with me everywhere . I have passed it on for all my friends to read . Mr. King at his Best .
B00080ZG10|3.0|I watch many movies over and over.  A one time view is all this will receive from me.
B000002O1Q|5.0|Loved the movie and loved the soundtrack.  The Fire Inc. tracks are the best and I wished they had produced an album.  I might have to buy another if I wear this one out!
B0007M22TI|5.0|Fantastic, uplifting . . . Leaves you feeling good and wanting more.
0881036951|5.0|My almost 5 and 7 year old daughters love this book.  I think it is the simplicity and vivid imagination that make it a classic.  I would HIGHLY recommend this as a must have for any kid's library!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|The reviewers that did not enjoy this movie obviously need to upgrade their surround sound system big-time. This is one hell of an entertaining movie, and the soundtrack and flight scenes are nothing short of awesome! The first 5 minutes of flight deck action to 'Danger Zone' is worth the price of the DVD alone. Nuff' said!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I bought this CD within days after it came out, and after listening to it once, immediately ordered two more as Christmas presents.  \\"Awake\\" features more songs in Engish than his earlier CDs, and the songs \\"You are Loved\\" and \\"So She Dances,\\" are even more of what I love most about Josh Groban--songs that somehow lift me up and carry me away.<br /><br />In \\"Awake\\" Josh is trying new things (the song \\"Machine\\" comes to mind--which is kind of a mix between ballad, new age and...well, rock and roll), and he crosses new territory, without leaving behind that thing he does best which is his knack for creating songs that move the listener to -feel- every single note.  I very highly recommend.  I could say this is my favorite yet of Josh's work, but that wouldn't be true--there isn't a Josh Groban CD yet that I haven't absolutely loved.
B00006B1HH|1.0|I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MY ORDER FOR TWO MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO ASK FOR MY REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000AGTPUK|5.0|We love the fun story line and heart-warming lesson to \\"Believe\\" in our hearts of the symbols of Christmas.  Our 2 1/2 year old so loves the \\"Train Movie\\" too.  We love how the movie animation follows the animation in the book which is another favorite of ours.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card arrived quicker than I expected and my husband was surprised to find it in his stocking Christmas Morning. It works great, right now we have over 6 games saved in it. Loved the lime green color. :)
B00005ATQF|5.0|Those who are/were enlisted Marines, relive your boot camp days in the first half of this movie by listening to the DIs belittle you from the ground up and make real Marines out of you again.  For those that are not Marines, this all-time classic is as close to boot camp you'll want to be.  The second half possibly captures the general feel of the Vietnam War, but since I'm not a veteran of that war, I cannot comment beyond that.  A classic must-watch for Marines and non-Marines alike!
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|this item is as described, completely new, arrived before estimated date, in perfect condition, we should buy only from amazon since their items are perfect, and arrive very quick, unlike others, just for saving a buck or two, i had one movie delivered within A MONTH ,...figure it out. <br /> <br />PERFECT BUY!!!!!
B000J103YI|5.0|Have you ever popped in a CD for the first time and listened to it entirely, and after the first listen you find that the music from the CD is stuck inside of your mind?  This is what the \\"Dreamgirls\\" soundtrack has done to me and several of my friends!  This is purely good music, replete with soul and sass.  The Dreamgirls, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and a few others help to deliver the great music found on this album.  There is a song for just about every phase of love: falling in love, being in love, regretting being in love, and falling out of love.<br /> I would be remiss if I didn't mention all of the positive feedback Jennifer Hudson's acting and singing skills have received.  This woman is a singing powerhouse, and her remarkable voice is heard repeatedly on this soundtrack.  She delivers \\"Love You I Do\\" so sincerely and passionately.  This song has a tremendous effect, especially to someone who is in love.  The lyrics are truly sweet and the production is also worth mentioning, the drumming arrangement in particular.  Jennifer leads the Dreamgirls in their song \\"Dreamgirls (Finale)\\", and also does a great job, but this time, she reserves herself vocally.  However, she gives her listener all that she has on \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\".  There aren't many songs that are sung like this!  She took her voice to the maximum capacity, and didn't strain once, now that's talent!<br /> Jamie Foxx has a few songs as well.  \\"When I First Saw You\\" has two versions: one with Beyonce', and one without her.  \\"When I First Saw You\\" is a nice ballad.  The song is about love at first sight.  He also has a collaboration with Eddie Murphy entitled \\"Steppin' to the Bad Side\\", which is the CD's only lackluster song.  The song is out of place, the production is mediocre at best, and the lyrics are repetitive and uncanny.  The best part about the song is that two comedian extraordinaires are singing it.<br /> Eddie Murphy's songs are just like he is: humorous.  The fashion that he sings his songs seem as though they were intended to make its listener laugh.  Take \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Fake Your Way to the Top\\" as examples.  His voice, his adlibs, his harmonies are just funny, but at the same time, he delivers a nice vocal performances!  Perhaps the best example of him being amusing on a song is \\"I Meant You No Harm/Jimmy's Rap\\".  The song actually starts out with a good vocal performance from Eddie, but by songs end, he has totally cracked his listener up!<br /> Last, but never least (NEVER) is Miss Beyonce'.  What can we say about this R&B queen?  Well, Beyonce's usually completely overuses her voice, but on this album, she has really good control over her songs, something I have never seen her do, but something I was very happy to see her do.  \\"One Night Only (Disco)\\" is an album highlight.  I enjoyed every aspect of this song.  It's definitely something you can dance to.  \\"Hard to Say Goodbye\\" is a really nice song.  It is very heartfelt, especially after you have seen the movie and you know all of the struggles the Dreamgirls faced as a unit.  Beyonce' shined on each of her contributions, but \\"Listen\\" is where she was most vibrant.  This song never fails to touch me.  This is probably her best song when it comes to controlling her sound.<br /> I highly recommend this album to everyone! Everyone should find something they like on this musical treasure.  5 stars...all the way.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. Hard To Say Goodbye<br />2.  Love You I Do<br />3. Listen<br />4.

B00000K2W1|5.0|This cd will blow you away if your a fan of Janis! Her voice and music ablity is so good!!! and who doesnt love a greatest hits. Summertime is just the best song for a nice warm day when your going down to the water.
0446528056|5.0|Excellent reading, as always with Nicholas Sparks works.  Outstanding research in the writing of this book; tender, loving, happy and sad.  Such easy reading, it was hard to put it down.  I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially women rather than men, unless they are very tender-hearted.
B000000XB9|5.0|you have to love CCR and this cd has all the good ones.
0307237699|5.0|At last, a well written and well thought out position on issues of the day!  Clearly, Barack Obama is a star on the horizon.  I will be following his rise with interest.  A must read!
0375751513|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is a book that truly makes you think about the possibilities of reality.  Along with the supernatural qualities, the novel dives into the realm of society and hints to us that we should really think about who we surround ourselves with.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have honestly been a hate them, love them, could care less about them fan of Green Day since about 1992. I reluctantly bought this CD shortly after it came out when a friend told me how good it was during a could care less about them phase and it was all I ended up listening to for a long time.   <br /> <br />Lets face it, how many times have you heard a song somewhere or seen a video for it on TV and ran out to buy the CD and it's the only darn good song on it! I don't know about you, but after I spend my money on a CD for one good song it makes me not want to buy any more CD's for a while and just pay the $1 to download that one good song you like online. <br /> <br />Now I don't know if Green Day put subliminal messages on this CD or what but this album from the first time I listened to it was just one of those rare CD's that you buy and every song on it is just GREAT! The flow of the music through the tracks on the album is just seamless and there is just truthfully not one song that you will want to skip through. <br /> <br />I would absolutely put this album on my must have list of music!! <br /> <br />
B0001NBMEE|5.0|The movie was as I remembered in my early years.  The reproduction is as I remembered it.  Thanks.
B000J103PC|5.0|I was was drug off to this film when it was in theaters because my girlfriend wanted to see it, and by the end of the film, I was glad I went. While from the outside it appears to have 'chick-flick' written all over it, there is a little bit of everything for everybody in it. It has its moments of humor, suspense (sort of), romance, and moral debate, and in the end, this all makes for a very entertaining film.
0066620996|4.0|I had to review this book for a library management class and really enjoyed it.  Collins combines your typical easy-to-read how-to management book with a scientific study of companies that made a drastic shift from average to stellar.  While I'm not sure that his results are as clear cut as he does, he clearly explains why his research group came to the conclusions they did, so you can decide for yourself.  And even though I'm not sure that his ideas are 100% water-tight, I still think they're more than just a step in the right direction.  The book is also full of great examples from the companies he studied.  If nothing else this is an excellently written group of case studies. <br /> <br />As a non-business person, I still found the principles easily applicable to my situation, especially since one of his major findings was that the great companies weren't after profit for the sake of profit alone, but as a result of being excellent at their company's core mission.  But if you'd like to see a closer correlation to the non-profit sector, you can read his brief follow-up: Good to Great and the Social Sectors.
1401201911|4.0|Liked it, quite a bit. It's one I'm glad I own as I'll probably want to re-read it in the future.
074322454X|4.0|I'll just say it's a good read before (or after) you see the movie Band of Brothers. The book is very detailed and of course as in any book, you learn more of what goes on in the training and battles, for example.  <br /> <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Im glad I got dragged to see this in the theater.  I bought a copy for my mom and my uncle.  It is a film that will apeal to a broud audiance.   <br /> <br />Very, very, funny.  So says I.
1881273156|4.0|My husband and I have difficulties communicating and this book shows that people have different communication 'styles' or groups of styles.  Understanding how another person wants to be shown that they're loved is very helpful, especially when your style of showing love is different.  I recommend the book to couples wanting to show love and committment.
0060793333|1.0|After two attempts to order and receive an audio version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I am still without this product which I had purchased for my daughter for Christmas. <br />Even though I am hopeful that Amazon will be able to locate the source of the faulty packaging, my purchase will not be replaced.  I will have to take my business elsewhere for this product.  Needless to say, I am disappointed. <br />S. Fox
B000JLTRKE|5.0|This one was for me and I was so touched by it.  The DVD was so realistic and I cried the same way that I did the day that it happened!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I needed this cd like yesterday and I received it in a timely fashion.  Thank you for your great service!
B000002U9E|5.0|Kate Bush's albums that came before Hounds Of Love are interesting and exciting in their own right, and those that followed displayed their own perspectives of Kate's musical genius - but Hounds Of Love is the pinnacle of Kate's skill, ability and, most importantly, her art. <br /> <br />Very few albums from 20+ years ago can still sound as contemporary and dynamic today as they did on the day they were released.  But this album could be released tomorrow and would easily garner the critical praise and audience excitement and that it did in the mid-80s.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|These guys are great!!! I have seen them in concert and the women go crazy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband read the book & then I ordered this for him for Christmas. He really enjoyed it as did I. Makes one truly appreciate what these men did for our freedom & our country.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|This dvd is great , especially for the newcomers to the talent and diversity of Joe Bonamasso. I highly recommend this for all the lovers of the blues and just great guitarists.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|While this CD does not match the heights of \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\", it is still very good. If you are a fan, you will enjoy the music.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|There is a reason this film is an all-time classic. In fact, there are many reasons.<br /><br />James Stewart is absolutely \\"wonderful\\" in his performance as George Bailey - his dialogue, humor and approach to the role should be taught in all acting schools. Unfortunately, judging by most of today's actors and movies - it is not.<br /><br />Donna Reed plays his wife and also delivers a magnificent performance. It is absolutely amazing (and well deserved) that their work is still being enjoyed worldwide - some SIX DECADES after this film's initial release!<br /><br />Frank Capra has to be mentioned in any review of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" - his cinematic direction and vision in this touching film is unmatched - even today.<br /><br />This is a must-own movie for your collection.
0374525153|5.0|A simple tale that leads you along the edges of evil, the ugly gratuitous possibilities that lurk within the human personality, and also reminds  you breathtakingly that each person is an opaque mystery. A very important read for an evil-infatuated age.
0736063684|5.0|I bought this book for reference material.  I am a personal trainer and I found the illustrations and descriptions very informative!  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in strength training and the muscular system of the human body.
0684824906|5.0|Not just the best book I've read on Lincoln, but the best book I've read. I'm not exaggerating.  I truly enjoyed this book.  If you didn't previouly think Lincoln was a genesis, this book will convince you he was.  It was fact filled, easy to read and I can assure you not easy to put downn once you get started.  This is a must read for anyone interested in the Civil War, Lincoln, or American history.  You'll be thrilled you did.
B000066AXC|5.0|very happy to have this movie well pleased thank you whoray33
B000I0QK74|5.0|Sweet James never disappoints and this album is no exception.  A really fine artistic achievement and a wonderful album to listen to anytime, especially at Christmas.  James is sublime.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|no doubt about it, he's back. if you want to hear dylan w/ a little blues, a little folk rock, and a whole lot of soul. buy it.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's Christmas album is exquisite.  Buy it for everyone who loves good music and who wants to grow and discover.  Buy it for yourself. This album won't let you down.  An amazing accomplishment.
B00004W3L3|5.0|One of the best productions from Marillion, back in their golden age.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is a film that actually deserves the much-overused adjective, \\"unique.\\"  Its subject is nothing less than the whole of creation, and in particular the human beings who inhabit it.  Ranging swiftly over the whole planet, it gives the impression of what God must see from the heavenly vantage-point.  It tells a story that covers every part of the spectrum of human emotions, from exuberance to grief.  The transitions in the film are especially artful - the camera takes in one visual image, then swiftly moves to a similar image from a whole different cultural context.  For those willing to try something a little different, Baraka is a deeply satisfying viewing experience.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Great music, great singing, great content. I hope more bands will produce music like this one.
0446528056|5.0|This is another good book by Nicholas, he does a good job of keeping you wanting to keep reading without putting the book down. <br />I can't wait until his next book.
0789310627|5.0|My son (7-year-old now) has been reding this series since age 4 every time we visited a new city.  We have London, Paris and San Francisco books.  They are all brilliant to read pre-trip and post-trip.  Although cities have chnaged over the years, the books give a very good feel of the cities.  They also give footnotes of updates.  Not only my son enjoys them enormously, but my husband and myself learned a lot from the series. Highly recommended.
B000H5U832|5.0|OMGosh!!  My son watches it numerous times a day!!  Great movie - it'll be a hit for quite some time!!  I really enjoy watching it over & over again  too!!
0441009425|2.0|This book starts off well, but really drags for the last 80%.  Don't bother.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this DVD for the same reason everyone else did: I saw it in the theater and loved it. If I ever get my surround sound home theater set up this is the first movie I'm going to watch. Pixar's movies keep getting better and better. They scored a TKO with this movie by getting the kids and any parent(s) who love cars or love NASCAR, or both, together in the theater glued to the screen. All \\"car guys\\" need to own this movie.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|As an art student, interested primarily in life drawing and composition and painting, the cartoon art of Illustrator Hal Foster was necessary study. In 1954 amidst the swarming of resurgence of Swashbucklers, and knight's in training films, came PRINCE VALIANT by Director Henry Hathaway.<br /><br />The film is ablaze with color, adventure, courageous uphill battles by the just against the Imperial evils we know so well these days, and what a cast! James Mason as the well named, evil Sir Brack, and a young Robert Wagner, as Valiant the Scandinavian Super Hero, Sir Gawain, played by Sterling Hayden, the irrepressible Yachtsman back from another trip abroad with his son and eager to make some money for his next foray into the South seas, trying hard to be anything but a cowboy or a gangster, Brian Ahern as King Arthur, Janet Leigh, bursting out of her gowns and as gorgeous as possible in her youthful perfection of face and form, Debra Paget, as her lovely sister Ilene, all supported by Victor Mclaglen, Donald Crisp, Barry Jones, Mary phillips, Nevile Brand, Tom Conway, Sammy Ogg, Howard Wendle and many other character actors give the film a festive sparkle of color, contrast and spectacle worthy of Dean Cornwell or Frank Brangwyn paintings, still popular in that era of the 1950's at least among art students, lik me.<br /><br />If adventure, without CSI Miami gore, is something you enjoy, this is a primer in good versus evil. Here, though not nearly of Academy Award quality, is good, clean, honest adventure of the sort that helped boys grow into altruistic men, something lacking in today's choices for young people, There is no eye-covering horror here, simply swashbuckling joy for boys, girls and for most parents, who spurn the kind of filth that is marketed now to the young of age or heart.<br /><br />A lost Kingdom regained, a lost love rescued, a lost family of men at arms bonded and rejoined in hand-to-hand battle. For sheer splashes of costumed elegance, clanging, clashing, swordplay, this ranks close to the Errol Flynn/Raphael Sabatini favorites.<br /><br />I recall waiting expectantly as a boy for the Singing Sword to hum its tune in full battle and I was not disappointed. The scoring of this film by Franz Waxman is OUTSTANDING and still sells well today on screen.<br /><br />This is the pattern along with the Saturday morning serials from which Captain Comeback films like STAR WARS were derived.<br /><br />I GIVE IT 4.5 STARS AS HONEST ADVENTURIST, ART STUDENT'S DELIGHTanging, clashing, swordplay, this ranks close to the Errol Flynn/Raphael Sabatini favorites. <br />I recall waiting expectantly as a boy for the Singing Sword to hum its tune in full battle and I was not disappointed.

B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is a film I gave as a holiday gift  to a film maker.  He loved it.  I loved it too.  Shows so beautifully the state of the planet and its inhabitants.  No words interfere with the incredible pictorial presentations.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|This is really perfect for the casual or new U2 fan. The order of songs was not that well thought out, but the overall capture of U2's singles is great. Window in the Skies is a great new tune and it might actually pull some good charting numbers.
0446677450|5.0|The Best
B000F8O35U|5.0|Purchased this DVD for our God-daughter; however, we already had the disc for our girls.  This is a great movie for anyone.  Our kids love the songs.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|The DVD was like new, just a few minor flaws which do not affect the movie. THe movie has great footage in the Bahamas, the story is so-so. Plays great in HI-DEF.
0684824906|5.0|If there were ever a book written that depicted the genius and the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, this is it.
B00006AW2O|5.0|for anyone that thinks they know the music of the stones, but do not have this cd, you are in for a history lesson!.....the stones started out as a blues band and this album was the early stones at their best! be prepared for the experience......
0739334085|5.0|I did not really know the first thing about Mr. Obama before I listened to this book.  I recommend you all do the same.  Listen to the book... Mr. Obama reads it to you.  I find it the best way to experience a biography and get the full effect.   <br />I think I really enjoyed this because Mr. Obama does not try to justify his beliefs as much as he tries to really explain to you what his greatest influences are and how he changes everyday and how from the perspective of humble honesty he has become the person he is today.   <br />He does not spout venom or anger.  He doesn't attack the other side.  In many ways, many times... he seems to really be urgently asking we all do a Beatles style come together.   <br />Brush up on your New Deal history.  He does talk nice about Bill. Love ya Bubba!  Your still the one!   Know your Lincoln and Hamilton and founding fathers.  It was nice that the only name dropping Mr. Obama really did were names of the dead Presidents.   <br /> <br />I will listen to it again.  I have to.  I just didn't get it all the first time.  I nodded along with him many times, catching myself agreeing with him without even realize I was... a few Amen's.   <br /> <br />I had no idea what to expect.  I had seen him on Oprah and recoginized he was one to watch for the coming elections and was eager to know more.   <br />I am certainly glad I took the time to hear what he had to say.
0743298020|4.0|I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 only because it wasn't as riveting as I thought it might be.  It's an interesting story, and I'd say that if you enjoyed Jane Eyre, you'd enjoy this book.  The main character seems a little odd at first, mainly because she is so isolated and has no friends whatsoever.  I got used to her, though, and the book reads pretty easily.  I had a theory about the ending that was close to correct, so it may not be a surprise ending for everyone.  Still, though, it's a good book and a nice way to pass a rainy afternoon.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is fantastic and I'm happy to see the reputation he's making for himsellf. As a young singer, he certainly seems to possess all the same fine qualities in his voice as the greats do. I'd rank him with the likes of Pavarotti.
0385336810|4.0|The main thing to remember with books like these is that you read them as \\"brain candy,\\" not as deep, thought-provoking books.  I really enjoyed this book as a funny diversion to pass the time.  It doesn't require a great attention span, just an ability to appreciate a book for what it is, silly and fun.  As a teacher, sometimes I just want to read for fun, not a strict academic purpose.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this, but it was fantastic! My daughter also loves it! The singing and acting are top-notch!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|My son came home from college just 3 weeks before Christmas telling us he wanted to buy the Friends DVD Collection for his girlfriend and needless to say, we were not sure he would have the DVDs in time for Christmas. Luckily, we received the order within 1 week of placing it had absolutely no hassles.  Thank you so much! We look forward to doing business with you again soon!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|the item was in excellent condition, had a nice price and was received in a timely manner.
B000HCO83G|2.0|I am a true fan of the X-Men series. The second movie was dynamic and I was very excited at the prospect of seeing the \\"Last Stand.\\" Now I regret having bought it. The plot is transparent and monotonous. I was especially disappointed with the special effects. In this age of  technological advance, I would expect the effects to provide a spectacular visual experience, but they did not even come close. Great movies are memorable. Even good ones leave us with a \\"takeaway\\" message. They inspire the audience to move forward and yet to always remember that one line or that one character or that one scene. This movie possesses none of those qualities. If you want to see mundane science fiction, this movie is for you, but if you expect the quality of the previous movies in the X-Men series, you will be sorely disappointed.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Excellent because this film incorporated excellent character development throughout; also because of the incredible inspiration this plot conveys to youngsters about achieving success without benefit of a wealthy family.  Sean Connery is like fine wine...improves greatly with age. <br /> <br />Recommend this film highly, especially to teens and those interested in the pursuit of a career as authors or journalists.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|For those of you who care, this album is absolutley perfect. Incubus is the first band in some time to truly approach genious. Lyricly and musicaly the best thing to hit the scene in some time.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|Not my favorite by any means.  Left you hanging at the end and not in a good way, like wanting to rush out and see the next one.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|I purchased a PS3 when it came out. One of the reasons I was hot for one was for Blu-Ray playback. I have a rear projection Mitsubishi HD set from a few years back. It has no DVI or HDMI, just standard Component HD inputs. I got home with my new PS3 and Blu-Ray disks and set it all up. I watched a few fantastic looking Blu-Ray movies: Fifth Element, Last Samurai, and Enemy of the State. But when I finally put Fugitive in, I was blown away. I can't believe how this older film scanned to HD so well! It was like watching it for the first time. My whole family stopped what they were doing and sat down and watched this movie. Now I have enjoyed the quality of all the Blu-Ray disks I have spun up in my PS3 as they have all finally made my Mitsubishi 48 inch HDTV show me what I paid for when I bought it. But this disk made my Mitsubishi look like a 55 inch movie theater. I swear, the picture was bigger and more in-my-face than other Blu-Ray disks I have watched. I don't know what Warner Bros. is doing to re-master their movies to HDTV, but keep it up!<br /><br />P.S. - I knew Tommy Lee Jones's face was messed up, but HDTV shows it all! DAMN!!
1878424777|5.0|Along with this CD, I recommend getting the book.  It is one of the most powerful sources of freedom. The Four Agreements are essential as a guide in life.  I listen during the day and clarify with the book at night.  It is simple, logical and very powerful.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Mt grandchild has viewed this dvd many times since Christmas.  Loves it.  I think she would like to be Ariel!!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|The more I listen to the CD, the more I love it.  If you like Josh Groban's other CDs you will like this one.  My favorite song on the CD is \\"So She Dances\\".  I love the words and the music to this song.  I just stays in my head all day long.  It's a great CD.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack, with all of the selections from the film. It has a relaxing quality and evokes images from the oscar nominated film. Well worth the money.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|I was not disappointed. Everything worked. The directing, the acting, and the beauty of the picture was superb. I have been trying to find a good modern romance to watch for over a year, and this movie met all of my expectations. Keanu did an excellent job and Sandra Bullock shines. The two actors have intense chemistry, and I hope they do more pictures together in the future.
B000002J0P|5.0|This is pretty close to a supergroup - some great songs well produced and well played - what more can you ask? <br /> <br />Teach your Children well about great rock and buy this album and play it for them ;).
B00008DDSC|5.0|I love this DVD.  The story is excellent and thoughtfully told.
1582701709|5.0|THE SECRET (book version) is much like THE SECRET (film version), but with expanded information and some important extras. I particularly liked the Neville Goddard exercise Rhonda Byrne includes (which was not in the film) -- to lie in bed at night before sleep and re-live your day, making everything that was NOT perfect absolutely perfect in your mind, so you can start the next day vibrating at a very high level and thus make tomorrow wonderful. For that tip alone, the book was well worth the price! I also enjoyed the stories of people who had used The Secret and found miracles in their lives. This is a wonderful book to keep on your night table, re-read and reflect on. No matter what you think you already know about the Law of Attraction, this book has something to offer you.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I hated this cd at first, it was too electronic or techno for me...but after going through this cd once more I fell in love with the sound and LOVE it now and have kept it in my car and keep replaying it over and over!!
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Sort of like an updated Waltons.  Very entertaining and excellent acting.  I hope Season Two is released soon....
0375505091|5.0|Absolutely amazing.  The prologue is a \\"must read\\"  before getting into the photographs themselves as it tells a warm, loving, mournful tale of Annie Lebowitz's life.  I heartily recommend this book to all that enjoy beauty, compassion and life in the form of photography.
B00003CXAY|2.0|These two movies are a montage of slow-motion, fast-motion, and time-lapse filming set to music.  One shows the how man works and the other how man uses the planet.  I wanted to like these but I found the constant image changing and music aggravating.  They are very interesting and have good messages but I can't stand the constant sensory bombardment.
B00000F14B|5.0|NOW THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE. NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING YOUR CHILD SHOULDN'T SEE. SIMPLY GREAT MUSIC AND ACTING. A MUST HAVE.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I found \\"No Direction Home\\" an entertaining document chock full of old footage and photographs of the era of Folk music in NYC. I found the interviews with the Bob Dylan of today intriguing and found what he said to be insightful, rather than full of cryptic messages in his old interviews. I do wish, that it would have continued on with more current years as that's of interest to me as well.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I bought this CD because I really like Incubus.<br /><br />I thought it would be a bit like the last albums, that I would have to listen to it for a while before loving every single track.<br /><br />Well, it's been a bit different: there are a couple of tracks that I really LOVE but, the rest of the tracks are quite difficult to listen to.<br /><br />Before buying this CD I would recommend that you try to listen to the whole album! Good Luck
1569242739|5.0|this book is absolutely incredible. isa really knows her stuff. i've made these cupcakes for friends, family, and work and everyone RAVES About them... vegans and non-vegans alike LOVE them!!!! some of the recipes are so simple, i didn't even have to go out to buy the ingredients. they were right there in my house!! they are not low fat, but you can always sub applesauce for oil.  it makes them a little more cakey, but not so guilty. i hardly ever baked before i got this book and now i love it. so easy and so delicious!!!
0321344758|5.0|Quick read, but provides great insight into how users work... how we work.  Definitely reccommend it.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Santa got this movie for the whole family, even though the gift tag said it was for my 2 y/o son.  It's a great movie all around; computer animation is great, message about friendship and teamwork is easily grasped by even preschoolers, and the humor will catch make parents smile as well as the kids.  We all loved the movie, even my 16 y/o daughter, who thinks doing anything with parents is the epitome of lame.  Thumbs up!!!
B0000X61VE|5.0|The workout is awesome!!! I had it on VHS for a long time and since technology was taken over by DVD players I thought I should upgrade mine too... The moment I started working out I notice my body shaping...it's just great and its not difficult...I guess for those who are not working out often, they might need to do it in parts until they feel the stamina to go through the whole 40 min program. But generally speaking, I like the work out a lot!!!
B00005ATZT|5.0|I've first bought this film on tape, and now have this DVD. This fast-moving action film still keeps me on the edge of my seat. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones could not be better as adversaries in Ford's dogged search for proof of his innocence in the murder of his wife. You can count on a tightly wound, well-told story, with many great twists and turns, plus the element of surprise that maintains a high suspense factor till the final credits. <br /> <br />OK, there is a great train wreck scene. But if you are expecting a lot in the way of special effects, shoot-em-up blood and gore, bad acting and a mindless plot, this is not the movie for you. Everyone else: grab the popcorn and enjoy this film.
B000021Y77|5.0|'Run Lola Run' is a fast-paced film with a philosophical message.  Lola has 20 minutes to find a huge sum of money or her boyfriend is going to have to answer to some very angry gangsters. <br /> <br />We are given three differenct scenarios about what choices Lola could have made, and how those choices play out for good or bad.  This is all done at a breathless pace filled with dark humor.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Purchased this CD  after seeing the amazing musical in London.  It's fantastic and I delight in playing it on my CD player especially in my SUV.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki is one of the great animators of all time, and this film, and 'Sprited Away' are his masterpeices.  It was so good I had to see it twice while it was in the theater.  <br /> <br />Miyazaki doesn't make movies with simplistic 'Good vs. Evil' scenarios, but creates worlds filled with nuance and complexity.  The visuals are stunning, the characters are interesting, and the story rich and multi-layered.  A real joy to watch.
0307237699|5.0|I enjoyed it very much.  What else can I say?
0861714911|5.0|After having read a few books on buddhism, which caused some confusion around what Buddhist (would) say, what they believe and what Buddha actually said, I found this book fundamental. I was alway afraid of the long long sutras - and I almost gave up reading the original words of Buddha. Now I think there is no better introduction to Buddhism than the real source. After this, explanations and summaries of buddhism are easier to grasp and judge. But I needed a good introduction to it. It was this book.<br /><br />I particularly liked the sensible 'shortenings', i.e. when repetitions are omitted. It might be strange for the first time, but you soon get used to it and it makes sense. It is a thick book anyway with many essential areas of what Buddha said to the lay people and to monks and to this own disciples. A wonderful compilation.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Well, you either have watched Lost already, or you wouldn't be looking at the second series.  Lost is Lost.  It just gets better, and the more it gives you answers the more questions you have.  Will it be resolved?  Do we even want it resolved?
0688014291|5.0|OMM is an oversimplified version of how to lead people.  It applies not only to work, but to parenting, relationships in a church, or anywhere else.  While it is simple, it is profound.  I read this book about once a year as a refresher.  It is a must-read.  Sometimes the writing is a bit corny, but look past that to get the message, which is simply the best way to lead people.  I also recommend the \\"One Minute Manager and the Monkey.\\"
0670034711|5.0|I discovered this book from Oprah's magazine which contained a snippet from EPL. Just that snippet left me in tears due to the raw precision of how Elizabeth expressed her experiences.  I went and bought the book the next day and attacked it like a baby at feedin' time.  I haven't travelled the globe like Elizabeth has, but my journey through emotions and all in the process of creating my true self has been very similar.  Not only is the book affirming, but it presents solid proof that the pursuit of truth, self-awareness, honesty and authenticity is never wasted.  May not always feel good, but the results are always worth it.
0307237699|5.0|He says what many already think about ourselves, our country and our future. Plain talk, down to earth but still intelligently written.  Should be required reading regardless of your politics for what it says about us.
0679411585|4.0|For a clear and comprehensive understanding of what a major battle looked like from the ground and from both sides of a conflict, this is an highly informative book.  It's detailed depiction leaves one with a deeper understanding of how horrible war really is and just what we ask soldiers to do when we send them to fight for their countries.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|Great 1950's inovative scifi!!  The tin is a very nice collectors item.
B0000033K2|5.0|A fascinating insight into the artistic development of one of the great innovators in jazz through his earlier recordings. Highly recommended.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is the perfect compliment to both Eric and JJ. Whether you like it or not most music sessions are jamming sessions to begin with. I love the realistic approach this CD takes to that fact. It is an excellent addition to my collection! I don't think you will be disappointed either!
B000I5X81K|4.0|I for one can't say that Josh does any wrong.  So I love this cd but some of my friends say it is a departure of his usual music.  He does go in some different directions but as I say he can do no wrong by me.  I love his voice.
0060922583|4.0|Wild, but feasible explanation of the existence of all <br />possibilities via an observational approach.  Fun and  <br />intriging, Enjoy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|A spoiled little girl caught up in a world of magic has made this <br />movie a favorite in our household. Miryazaki is a wonderous story <br />teller that has never dissapointed me.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a big book in a small package: a mystery, the tale of a family unraveling, a book that will make you laugh out loud, a novel that will teach you better than many non-fiction books about autism. <br />The author's experience working with autistic people is clear. So is his big heart and great talent. This is a wonderful novel, that I would recommend to everyone.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This was an awesome movie and I couldn't go without the soundtrack.  My 2 year old sings along!  I also love all the classics!  I listened to it all Christmas season and even after!!! and I'm still not sick of it!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This actually was given to me as a gift and I can not stop listening to it.  She is the only one I can say does justice to Happy Christmas (behind John Lennon of course).  I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone looking for some good Christmas music for those chilly nights by a fire with a loved one.
B000HCO840|5.0|Hugh Jackman is a GREAT choice to play Logan. All three movie were great!<br /><br />I'm happy to see Marvels greatest coming to the big screen.
B0000844M8|5.0|The movie was excellent. We saw it with our 2 grandsons, ages 8 and 11.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a very creative and unique album.  A must buy for all serious beatles fans.
B000H5U832|4.0|Not as funny as I had hoped it would be, I think I was looking for more \\"racing\\" also.
0740748475|5.0|My husband really enjoys Calvin & Hobbes.  He was suprised, and amazed that I was able to find the complete works.  Very much enjoys it.  It is a very handsome set, nicely bound.  Very heavy.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|It was a pretty good movie, typical British humor, plus I like thigh high boots as well.
079284131X|5.0|This is the one that started the series off. The perfect accompaniment would be the \\"Chucky collection\\" which contains 2-5. Saves you from purchasing them seperately. A must have if you are a fan of the films
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old LOVES this movie, and so do I! It is hilarious and like all disney movies there is a hidden \\"meaning\\" in there too. He will watching is over and over and over all back to back.
0743454537|5.0|A great read.  Picoult is a wondeful author and this is one of her best books.
0446677450|5.0|This is the book that got me excited about investing in real estate and changing the way I think about being wealthy and the way I invest period.  I will reread this book to reinforce the principles that are there.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|this was my least liked x-men movie.  i loved the new charaters they brought in but there wasn't enought time with them to get a feeling for them as individuals.  and the choice of Grammer as the Beast was poor at best. still very visual and a little too busy.  the Golden Gate Bridge was really over the top and not in a good way.
B000I0QK74|5.0|How can you not like James Taylor music.  This was just another of his great music endeavors.  Very relaxing.
1931559317|5.0|As a relative beginner to Amateur Astronomy I was a bit hesitant regarding the complexity of this small atlas. However I wanted something comprehensive yet small enough to carry to an observing site. I found the atlas not only truly comprehensive but also relatively easy to use (once I read the directions). A great portable atlas of the night sky and highly recommended. <br />Emilio J. Vazquez, MD
B00004CWO8|5.0|I bought this based on reading reviews of it on Amazon and elsewhere.  It was a curiosity item, and I am very familiar with the original traditional interpretation. <br />It seemed to start out rather slow, and in fact I almost decided to put it off altogether.  However, the more I watch it, the more it draws you in.  It has a very different feel and intensity missing from the traditional versions.  This is not a fluff piece. <br />By the time it was over, it had actually moved me emotionally more than I had expected.   <br />I am impressed enough to have subsequently purchased two more copies for people I love.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Pixar has done it again, and even raised the bar in my opinion.  This movie is not only hilarious, but also incredibly clever in its writing and execution.  The character development was dead on and the humor was non-stop.   From the obvious gags to the subtle hidden bits, this movie has fantastic replay value.  Highly recommended for ALL ages!
0486408434|4.0|This book is great for learning different card handling and shuffling techniques, however it can be a little tuff to follow sometimes. If you dont already have a basic understanding of how to handle cards you might want to start with a video first. It's usually a bit easier to learn when you can actually see whats going on. A side from all that, this is a really good book.
0618680004|5.0|Most people are taught from their youth to believe in God. Seldom do we admit to ourselves that our faith may be misplaced.  The most eye-opening discussions of the results of blind faith in God are revealed by Richard Dawkins.  \\"What harm could come from believing in God?\\" It turns out, a lot.  Even though I live in an extremely religious culture, I have had no direct evidence that God exists.  Still, I felt there was no harm in believing and practicing my religion.  Dawkins has helped open my eyes.  If I am complacent or discriminate against others or even worse, if I (and others) support war and discrimination against other religious cultures because of my blind faith, I make the world a much more dangerous and ugly place to live.  Dawkins has taught me to be a real \\"Christian\\" by not loosing my head to blind faith and by taking responsibility for my own thoughts and actions.  Truth and real advancements in knowledge have become my goals, and science provides both the method and the atmosphere for truth to thrive.  Dawkins presents such compeling thoughts for us to become better people by using, not loosing, our heads over religion.
B000F8O35U|4.0|Animated Disney Movie, what more can I say! The 2 disc edition is nice with all the extra's. I collect Disney movies, so I may be a little bias, but this movie is very good!
0765342294|5.0|Wonderful book for kids and adults.  Part of a great series of stories.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Early concert footage when the band was raw and hungry, dark and dangerous.  Kiss fans will enjoy this DVD as you will feel like you have scene a kiss concert from the early years.  Non-Kiss fans will get a sense of why this band became and institution.  They have digitaly remastered to the best they can, I suspect, the quality of the film and sound is decent but not great.  One problem is its mostly the same songs over and over for each concert.  Overall, well put together, good packaging, and good product.  Its comically how Gene Simmons is still recycling this same material making money off the first 3 years of the band.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Its a CD!  If you like the music its great, otherwise its not.
B000GYI32M|5.0|Perhaps this was the most exciting season I've seen, I can't wait for the fourth season
074356619X|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" is such a beautiful, amazingly high-quality-production DVD.   Having it available on CD to listen to while driving or under headphones by the bed before sleep has also been a lovely boon.   I have given the book to friends as gifts, as well.   The message in The Secret is so loving, so encouraging, so truthful, so uplifting, and so comforting in today's chaotic and stressful times.  I feel so empowered after seeing it or listening to the audio book, and I've had remarkable results in my life after applying The Secret's principles to problems confronting me.  The Secret, especially the new extended edition DVD, is definitely a \\"keeper\\" in our household, and we watch it  and/or listen to the cd's over and over, as necessary, when we need reinforcement of its solidly supportive message.   \\"The Secret\\" rocks!!
B000I5X81A|4.0|This CD is just fun.  JJ Cale and Eric Clapton just seem to belong together!  The music is great and the variety is most appealing. I highly recommend adding this to your collection today!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Two great artists Blending in to one great project,  This is my CD of the Year,   If you are a EmmyLou or Mark Knopfler fan, this is like a double scoop icecream cone, Some old muisic presented again and lots of new music, Put your head set on, lean back and let the concert come alive, <br /> <br />
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Josh steps into the shoes of the producer for this new CD.  He mixes World Music in with his already sensational singing voice and blends it all together without losing his original sound.  \\"Professional\\" reviews of Josh's new direction have been less than flattering but I think he is right on with what he needs to be doing.  He is incorporating his great talent and voice with other artists and sounds and growing into the role that he will surely be comfortable in for a long time. Yay Josh!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The FABS sound great ! George Martin & son Giles created a fascinating combination & collage of Beatle tunes ! The drumming on Tomorrow Never Knows inside Within You Without You, the bass lines on Hey Jude, the trio The Word/What You're Doing/Drive My Car, the beautiful sparce Harrison solo version of his While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the revamped Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite.....the list goes on and on !
B000002A46|5.0|I love this CD.  I bought this one for a friend because she loved mine.  It's such a happy, upbeat album, with some serious Xmas carols also.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I have little to add to the other reviews about the performance.  It is a classic.  Both Scotto and Pavarotti perform signature roles; certainly, Scotto may not have the \\"purest\\" voice for the part, but she is in good shape and, more importantly for a video, knows how to act.  Pavarotti is \\"early\\" rather than \\"late\\" Pavarotti -- voice in great shape and, although he doesn't look like the starving artist, he is able to move about the stage.  Niska turns in a superlative Muzetta; heard her sing several roles during that decade (from Nedda to Salome) and was always impressed with her voice and acting; never could figure out why she didn't make it \\"big\\".  As a couple of reviewers have pointed out, because of the age of the performance (1977), the video is a bit soft, not as sharp as we have come to expect in the digital age.  However, the lighting is good, the sets are typically MET traditional.  I've seen a couple of more recent Bohemes and find none better than this one.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love Whitney's voice and I love this CD. She is one of the greatest singers in the world. I hope she can recover from her addictions and start singing again.  She's such a great talent; it's a shame to see her throw it all away on drugs. This is a beautiful Xmas album.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I ordered this item to add to our DVD collection at home.  I love shopping Amazon, because I can shop for everything at one time.  The prices are a plus too.
B00005JNS0|5.0|A wonderful adult level animation for anyone 6 to 96.  A splendid historical romp!  Enjoy!  Pixar's done it again.
B00003CX96|5.0|\\"Breaking Away\\" represents a story driven movie with enormous heart.  It is real, never sappy, and blissfully free of the self conscious \\"feel good,\\" rising music, we are all in this together sap of current movies.  One feels the town, hears the bikes and senses that the characters represent people who actually lived.  Great stuff!
B000FIMG68|4.0|Although season one of LOST was far better, season two is good.  It helps to watch back to back episodes on the DVD just before starting the new season.  If you bought Season One then you need Season Two, and vice-versa.
630542845X|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies.  I have also purchased this for two young teens.  The movie provides entertainment, yet carries a very solid message to believe in yourself.  The two teens I gave this to were two young girls who lived in a foster home.  The movie provided a lesson that they both took to heart and in facing daily struggles, remembered Powder and how he carried forward. I recommend this movie to all ages for all will obtain a different reward!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|There is one line in the film that defines it..: \\"You're fu...ing with the best now\\". That, my dear \\"filmfan\\" CD Pulaski and that alone is why the hundreds and hundreds of reviewers here and actual movie fans love this film.<br /><br />  I've never heard anyone say that they like a movie because by liking it makes them \\"cooler\\" or more... what was your word? \\"gangsta\\". Your review is beyond laughable. The fact that you might compare this film to Natural Born Killer is ridiculous and explains that you obviously did not get any of the two movies.<br /><br />  People please, disregard certain reviews like the one from this \\"filmfan\\". This is oe of those people that his opinion represents that strangely odd 1% who say they're right and the rest of us among the remaining 99% are wrong, why do you think is that???<br /><br />  The movie is great, the actors were great, the time when it was realesed and what was actually happening at the moment with Cuba and cubans arriving to Miami was right on target. BUT IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! A++
0767802470|2.0|sound track not very good; sycronization of words in German version was off from original.............
0895260131|5.0|Very informative about Islam and the threat it poses to all non-muslims.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Dreams contains some of the finest cinematography I've ever seen.  8 short stories, each one incredible.  Highly recommended.
B000006XMB|5.0|You'll notice that Amazon has TWO listings for this Audio CD: the one you are looking at (2002 edition), and the seemingly older Unplugged [LIVE} (August 25, 1992 edition).<br /><br />I went to my local Border's store to look at the differences.  It appears that the 2002 edition is just a reprint of the 1992 Warner/Reprise edition.  The CD's on the inside look identical!  Also, at Borders they are the same price (as of this writing, about $17).  So if you are shopping through Amazon, I suggest the 1992 edition.<br /><br />All the songs on this CD have received extensive radio play.  It is a live performance, and both the music and the recording are excellent.  If you are just looking for screaming, high-pitched guitar -- forget it.  This music has soul, expression, and skill worth savoring again and again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great product. Tis a shame that it's run was so short. You can annalize why night and day, but the bottom line is that the Firefly 'verse just makes me happy!
B000I0QK74|5.0|JT's Christmas songs are so wonderful and utterly heartwarming. His version of \\"Go Tell it on the Mountain\\"  <br />will have you singing and dancing along! A+++++
B000002IAZ|5.0|The group didn't last long....but their impact with last forever!! There was just too much talent in this group- i.e. Steven Stills, Neil Young,Bruce Palmer (later replaced by Jim Messina) and Dewey Martin & Richie Furay... A rich collection of harmony, & the songs that were compliled for this \\"Retrospective\\" is AWESOME!!  Try it...you'll LOVE IT!!  ENJOY!! (As I did...my son too!!)   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I had watched this program rarely on TV here and there, never was really into it.  Seeing a good bargin I ordered Season 1 and was very pleased with my purchase.  The program, when watched in sequence is very entertaining.  I found myself very eager to watch the next episode.   <br /> <br />I'd give it 4 stars, as the extra's were poor but it was such a bargin it gets 5.  Really, I would like to hear about the serious things that went into the making of, rather than some actors sitting around commenting on hair styles. <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed it!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I really enjoy Josh Groban's music. Although before it was more classical and opra-ish I still liked but now this cd is a lot more contemporary. It doesn't hurt to go onto something like iTunes to at least try and listen if you're not sold on it yet. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Dark version of the Beowulf legend.  Probably better suited for viewers interested in different takes on Scandinavian mythology.  Acting in this version is only so so.  Few plot twists to keep the viewer guessing.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Want a good movie - a good old movie that you can curl up with?  I'm trying to show my kids the Good Old Movies - the classics that I LOVED when I was growing up.  Loved them.  This is one of them.    <br /> <br />Thanks for having it available.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This series of Lost is just as addictive as the first series. i can't stop watching it!!! Can't wait for the next series...
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This movie is amazing! I love how the scenery changes with the mood, while most directors just change the lighting and background music. Akira Kurosawa takes the art of movie making and takes it up to a whole other level of brilliance.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I HAVE EVERY CD/DVD IL DIVO HAS MADE AND ENJOY THEM ALL - ACTUALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT RELEASE
B000HA4WT8|4.0|Saw it in the theatres, was more fun at home in the privacy of my bedroom, wish it was in DTS like the original Fast and the Furious was :(
B00005JO9J|5.0|I love this show!!!  My sister is totally into it and she kept bugging me when are you going to watch an episode. So, I thought Ok... I will start from the begining and now I see what all the fuss is all about. What a great show and a wonderful group of actors. I have already bought and watched season two and can't wait till the new season starts on January 11th 2007.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I can't wait til May for the next season.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Beck bucks the bulk of budding artists by besting himself with the Information:long after the sun has set on the cd and the mp3 as a medium of exchange, the information contained in the Information will remain relevant.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Nothing Inconvenient about an Inconvenient Truth. The truth is we better change the relationship we have with our support system called Earth or the shifts in process may process the human species out of its comfort zone. Powerful,impactful, heart-wrenching, eye=opening.
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|Great movie, great DVD, shame they did not kept the original poster on the cover.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|This is great it brings classical style to a modern style and gives new life to the music of our fathers.
B00006DEF9|1.0|Although the film is wonderful amazon managed to send me the NTSC/region? version so it only plays in b/w. I would have thought this would have been checked before delivery
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The Open Door is a wonderful album full of dimension and unique sounds. Far better than Fallen (though that is a wonderful album itself), you get a full dose of Amy Lee's vocals and the intimate lyrics that make her songs so endearing.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Received the DVD package in good condition and in a timely manner. The quality is good. Well satisfied.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Giulio Cesare (JUL-io Chay-SAH-ray) was enjoyable in many ways.  No but, except, could-have-been, I-would-have-changed, or why-did-they.  Connolly plays Caesar and has a resemblance to Caesar.  De Niese is sexy and can dance.  Tolomeo (Ptolemy and Dumaux) is acrobatic and petulant.  The scenery and costumes and dancing are shifted from a Baroque interpretation of Caesar's time to today's interpretation of Egypt under the British Empire.  The performance has impact with acrobatics and confrontation and arguments and fights and pride.  There are several simultaneous involved stories.  It is in 16:9 HDTV format and 5.1 channel sound and way above NTSC TV quality.  I enjoyed the music and singing.  The second line of closed caption appears if you leave a black border around the video.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|a fresh new way to hear the Beetles for sure. Very nice transitions between songs and an interesting choice of tracks.
0618680004|5.0|I think a book like this has been long overdue. If humanity wants to move safely into a globalized world, we need to get our heads together and come out fighting against irrational faith witout evidence. Richard Dawkins gives us all the arguments we need. And I assure you: the book is fun to read. It's thrilling and you'll have a hard time putting it down.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen; since it shows how an individual can become unstuck in a life that seems mired in misery and/or a rut.. At first the film seems weird and stuffy but stick with it and after twenty minutes you will start to see the magic....And after forty minutes you will feel it!
B00005JPDJ|5.0|I loved this movie!<br /><br />I went with three of my daughters last night to see this movie; we are all regular theatre-goers...and the minute I walked into the house, my husband already knew by my face that this one was a keeper!<br /><br />I am going to pre-order the DVD asap; I would go to see it again and again!<br /><br />Kate Winslet and Jude Law were superb ~ not a surprise. Cameron Diaz and Jack Black were delightfully inspired! And the master, Eli Wallach, was (as always) wonderful...I will even overlook the faux pas by the scriptwriters in giving him that erroneous statement about where Cary Grant (my favorite actor) came from!<br /><br />If you see any romantic comedy this season, go to see this movie; I am going again!!!
B000IZJZLM|5.0|The tape is terrific and received it in a timely fashion in good order.
1594200823|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. I never thought the history of food, especially corn, could be so fascinating.  Rarely has a book provoked so much discussion.  It has made me look at food and food products in an entirely new way. I couldn't wait to tell all my friends about \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\".
1892005034|5.0|After reading this book I was also able to attend Marshall Rosenberg's 2-Day Workshop.  It was health to my heart & soul!  I am giving this book to friends as a gift at every opportunity!  With all the self-help teaching today, this is a first step to tapping into where it all starts - your communication - to self and others!
B0000844M8|5.0|The acting is bad, the dialogue is sometimes corny, and the production is certainly dated... but this is a PERFECT movie. I cry each and every time Elsa appears from the brush in the beautiful reunion.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Ok, let's start with artistic performance... this collection maybe is not the best one but still is a \\"must have\\". A little bit too \\"soft\\" but I like it. <br />Sound quality is excellent, too bad they didn't made as SACD.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I Love this movie.  It is so real and life like that I find myself watching it so much that my children complains, (smile) no matter, this is one movie I recommend to anyone who is looking for action and a good story line to make the action make sense. Cloud is my favorite character and his crew if off the hook.  I say go to your computer right now and go to amazon.com and place your order right away. it's a good buy.
B000001GXF|4.0|I think the price it's fair: the sound quality is not perfect, but the price is cheap and both Death and the Maiden and the Trout are enjoyable. For whoever is missing them and does not want to spend to much this is a fair purchase.
0743270754|5.0|Goodwin has given us an engaging, informative, powerfully written, readable volume about a President that stands in starkest contrast to the one we currently endure.  Many years ago I read Goodwin's \\"LBJ and the American Dream\\" and considered it one of the best histories I'd encountered.  This current work far surpasses even that effort.  A must-read for any American who wants to gain deep and unexpected insight into our country.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|Ok, I have to admit that I am a U2 fan and I purchased almost avery album before. But I liked this compilation! There are several reasons: first is that the singles are well selected and sorted (I enjoyed this compilation more than the 1990-2000). Also the new singles (in particular \\"Window in the Skies\\") are really nice. Another thing is that I was at the Milan concert and the DVD, even if I supposed it was going to be boring after a while, it was not! I really recommend this to whoever likes U2.
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is a movie my daughter and I love to watch together. She's a teenager so it's nice to have some \\"together\\" time.
B0002S947K|5.0|This cd has harldy left my cd player since I bought it.  Every song is great- that is a hard thing to find in albums now.  Ray's other album is good too, but Trouble is the place to start.
B000007ODL|5.0|JJ Cale is a master of his art. He paints a clear and precise picture in his songs. Considered to be a Songwriter 1st and a Guitar player second, he influenced Skynard, Clapton, and many others. The classic version of Cocaine is contained here, in this definitive collection of Cale's original tunes. As well as Call me the Breeze and After Midnight.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I liked Josh's other cd's better, however the more I listen to \\"Awake\\" the more I enjoy it.
B0000C6K09|5.0|This  4 cd pack is an anthology of all John Williams works. From his earlier works \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" and \\"Jaws\\" right through \\"Indiana Jones\\" and the most recent\\"Star Wars\\" prequel movies are included.  Williams work in thriller and horror are also included.  If you are into soundtracks and love movie music this is an essential buy.  The quality of the music is excellent.  With ten or more tracks on each cd it's well worth the money.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|tHIS IS THE BEST TOM WAITS RELEASE EVER. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!!! THE BEST!!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Any person who watched LOST since episode 1 will love this set! Too bad for the ending though, so I dont recomend you buy this except if you seen it on TV and woul dlike to own it, or you are sure Season 3 is out on DVD!
B00005JNTX|4.0|One of my favorites.  Loved the comic book style.  Dark and sinister but enjoyable and sometimes funny.
0739326651|4.0|I see much more in Obama's book than simply reclaiming the American Dream. <br /> <br />I see a dream for [dare we say plans for a dream for] the future all of humankind, for the future all of the earth, ... <br /> <br /> <br />A minor criticism (and one that I make with some frequency) is that the work is wordy and \\"overly articulate\\".
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I FIRST SAW \\"CELTIC WOMAN\\" ON THE LIVE SHOW PRESENTED ON PBS BOSTON AND IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.  AT THE TIME I TRIED TO FIND THE CD AS THE \\"CELTIC WOMAN\\" VOCALIZED WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO. <br />I DO ENJOY CELTIC MUSIC AND AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED \\"CELTIC WOMAN\\" IS ONE OF THE BEST. <br />I FOUND THE CD ON YOUR WEBSITE PURELY BY CHANCE WHEN I OPENED A PROMOTIONAL EMAIL YOU SENT. <br />I CANNOT RECOMMEND THE CD \\"CELTIC WOMAN\\" HIGHLY ENOUGH. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fantastic series, a real pity it didn't continue. A pre-series to the Serenity Movie ad well worth the purchase. A sci-fi western... what could be better, and along with the action the whit and humour is second to none. Highly recommended
B000IU3XTM|4.0|I am a big fan of Damien and \\"O\\" might possibly be my favorite album of all time so I have somewhat high expectations for this album.  Overall it seems to lack some of the passion that made \\"O\\" such a great album.  There are some songs that I just can't seem to fully get into whereas with O I was into every song.  However despite its inferiority to O its still a great album and I definitely recommend the purchase.  The opener 9 crimes is a very cool song and it almost sends you chills when Damien comes in to sing.  Other favorites of mine include \\"Accidental Babies\\", \\"Elephant\\", and I do like \\"Dogs\\" although it doesn't remind me of a Damien song.  If you get the chance to catch him live you won't regret it.  I do highly recommend the purchase of this album, although if you don't own \\"O\\" i would buy that cd over this one in a heartbeat.  I agree with other reviewers that the bell ringing is kind of annoying.  The B side \\"Rat in the Grain\\" or something or other is a pretty sweet song too, surprises me it wasn't selected for this album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000I5X80G|2.0|Disappointing CD in that it only contained 7 songs and the quality of the performance was far below the original recordings and, also, other Neil Young live performances of the '70's. I have been to the Fillmore East and many of their late shows went on till 5 in the morning with incredibly long jams and some of the best live music of that era. Sadly, this was not one of them. I purchased it on Neil's name only and the venue, expecting much more in terms of quality and quantity. Would return this purchase if this were permissable.

The series reference in the back is great as well as abbreviated practice series if you want to get a quick session in and don't have 1.5+ hours to devote at the time.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I expected this movie to present credible evidence supporting the theory that greenhouse gasses cause global warming, but instead was shocked to see the \\"science\\" was no better than that used on late night infomercials to sell products that don't work.  It ignores any fact which does not fit the theory. Failure to address contadictory evidence brings the whole theory into question as well as the motivations of it's proponents. The only thing that this movie proves is the extent to which people will go to further their political goals.    Yes, the planet is going through a warming cycle just as it has gone through warming and cooling cycles throughout it's existence. However, what we rarely hear is that there are several other theories for the reason this occurs. The most credible is the fact that the sun goes through warming and cooling cycles and is currently in a warming cycle.
B0000AUHOH|1.0|Well, this was the first major clinker of the big screen Star Trek sagas - but then I am not telling you anything new here. <br /> <br />Shatner ... can't ... direct!  (Apply pseudo Shakespearean emphasis). <br /> <br />Thankfully, Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country, (a/k/a \\"The Apology\\") made up for the mess.

B0000CDL93|4.0|Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" was meant to stir up emotions and provoke the viewer, and it certainly does that well. <br /> <br />There are a number of interesting performances in this film - including a very good Kevin Costner performance (this film is pre-outsized ego).  <br /> <br />And tons of actors racked-up major \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" links thanks to the large number of solid speaking roles in this film. <br /> <br />A worthy investement - even if you don't like Oliver Stone - this is a good to great film that will definitely get you thinking.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Too bad John Cleese and Connie Booth only wrote & produced 12 episodes, but re-playing them every once in a while will still provide enough laughs to cheer anyone up. <br /> <br />Anyone, that is, who likes to see the old-fashioned Britisher's penchant for public politeness and starchy protocol (no-matter-what the situation) get muddled and overcome by the practicalities of everyday life and the evolving (at the time) impatience with the stiff-upper-lip facade of British society -- a facade that began crumbling with the advent of Monty Python.  If you like watching how the Brits learned to poke fun at themselves in publicly-aired media, this one's for you. <br /> <br />Most episodes have that Monty Pythonian touch where over-exaggeration of a situation provides quite a bit of the humor, but the dialogs in Fawlty Towers are generally more witty and less slapstick than most of the Monty Python movies or TV skits I've seen.  An exception was the \\"Waldorf Salad\\" episode where the situation was exaggerated to an extreme that was too implausible to be funny, but even that episode has numerous punch lines that will evoke hearty laughter when regurgitated to those familiar with this outstanding series of 12.

074356619X|5.0|I saw the group on Larry King and decided to give it a try thanks to Bob Proctor's plug. There are so many things that make so much sense in this movie. I also got the CD to listen to in my car. You'll get a kick out of Rhonda's Australian accent. The way she says Law (lar) makes me smile.  <br />The thing that really impresses me is so many experts are on the same page with the law of attraction and what it does. Watch this and it will change your life, if you let it. If you're on the fence about ordering, let me give you a nudge. Do it! The cost of this program is nothing compared to what you will gain. \\"Thoughts become things\\"!

B000FQ4M58|5.0|What can I say? Its Meat Loaf! He just happens to be my favorite artist and this CD completes my collection of his CDs, excluding his live CDs. He is still an incredible artist, and displays his vocal mastership on yet another CD. Not all the songs are my style, and he seems to be drifting into more of a pop rock style than his classic rock opera. However, several of the songs on the cd have a redeaming quality... and for those songs I would recommend this CD.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|And the first time I listened to it I was disappointed because I wanted more of the same.  Then my music mixer played it for me unexpectedly weeks later and I loved it!  Go in with an open mind and enjoy.  This album does not push a Christian theme as much as the last if that means anything to you.   I enjoyed it alot.  If you like this band, you might also check out the Transiberian Orchestra.

B000I5X81K|5.0|From reading a lot of the reviews here you'd think Josh had made a complete about face with his music. Not true. Even though on a few tracks, the settings are different, his beautiful voice come through loud and clear. When you hear the words to songs like \\"Weeping\\", you know that isn't just your average shallow production. There's heart here and there's passion. I said this on an earlier review of another of his CD's and I'll say it again. With today's music industry that is lacking something, Josh Groban is one of the few lights.

6305428220|4.0|When \\"The Faculty\\" arrived at theaters in late 1998, the world had already seen it's share of over-hyped, over-dramatic and sarcastic teen horror from the mind of Kevin Williamson. Not only did we already have a \\"Scream,\\" but there was a \\"Scream 2,\\" as well as a corny \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" followed by a corny sequel with an even cornier title. To add insult to injury, he tainted what could have been an amazing comeback movie, \\"Halloween H20\\" with his own embarassing self-referential \\"touch-ups\\" on the script. Most horror fans, including me, placed blame on Williamson for watering down the horror genre, and forcing us to suffer through a five year period of bland horror that was finally put to rest with the flop, \\"Valentine.\\" However, working in Williamson's favor are two things. First, you can't blame him for \\"Disturbing Behavior\\" or \\"Urban Legend,\\" as he had nothing to do with them, and second, he did deliver this little underrated gem. Together with director Robert Rodriguez, \\"The Faculty\\" was brought to the screen in a style that set it aside from it's peers and with a story that, despite lacking in the originality department, didn't feel quite as stale.<br /><br />Six teenage stereotypes -- a jock, a brain, a pretty girl, a frumpy girl, a burnout, and a naive new kid -- band together when they discover that their school, and eventually their town, are being infested with an alien life-form. The teachers are more cruel and strict than before, and their parents and the police force aren't of much help either. Taking a cue from \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers,\\" the parasites in this movie use their human counterparts as a host, taking away what made them human and using their bodies to feed their needs. It's not too long into the film that the kids wise up to this fact. When Josh Hartnett, laying it on a little to thick as the burnout character, stabs his science teacher (played by John Stewart) in the eyeball with a homemade cocaine inside a pen, a plan to hunt down the Queen, which will theoretically save everyone (aside from the few they already wasted) is devised. The movie turns into a whodunnit of sorts, but without resorting to \\"Scream\\"-esque cliches. Rest assured, there are no long-winded explanations as to what their motivations are and how they pulled it off.<br /><br />One of the biggest flaws in this film would be the last fifteen or so minutes, which really degrades itself to some sort of b-movie monster flick. Needless to say, when the Queen reveals herself, it's a bit embarassing to watch. However, the movie on the whole is thoroughly entertaining. Even when it reaches into moments of cheese, it is still fun, thanks mostly to Rodriguez's expertise. One has to wonder how this guy got stuck directing a teen-horror flick in the first place. A fresh faced Elijah Wood, Jordana Brewster and Clea DuVall are fun to watch in the film, but it is really the Faculty themselves who take center stage. Rodriguez alumni Robert Patrick and Selma Hayek, along with Jon Stewart and Famke Janssen, threaten to steal the show. Their portrayals of overworked, underpaid and underappreciated teachers are spot-on and couldn't be closer to reality. I swear, I've had these people as teachers growing up.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Faculty\\" is an entertaining little sci-fi/horror that you'll probably want to watch more than once. Sure, it's become a bit dated eight years later, but of all the movies of it's kind popping up at the time, I'd have to say this is the best. The DVD is horribly disappointing, however, with no special features really to speak of. Hopefully one day they'll put out a special edition, with some commentary and some insight into the making of the film.plan to hunt down the Queen, which will theoretically save everyone (aside from the few they already wasted) is devised.

B000F6IOC0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it wasn't fantastic, nor was the original. But it was fun, and both reminded me of why I go to the movies. I like how this one picks up right where the first left off. I like how they focused more on the love story, which was one of my faveroute parts of the first one. The action is intense, and that big werewolf, was freaken scary.
1933784032|3.0|...it really depends on how you define \\"Sculpture\\" in the realm of film making....I realize that objects created in three dimensions might be the all encompassing one...but I think the line between Sculptor and Model Maker is the line that has been blurred with this book.<br /><br /> The examples of the model makers art are incredibly well illustrated,defined and showcased within, the work of the Creature sculptors...is glossed over and doesn't even have it's own chapter instead sharing a chapter with Droids....I was a bit mislead by the title \\"sculpting\\" a Galaxy....I know the small print read \\"inside the Star Wars model shop\\" but I really felt a bit short changed in the visuals for the creatures, make-up, and characters....My loss as a Sculptor and fx artist.<br /><br /> If you are model builder this is gold mine of details...enjoy!
B000I5X81K|5.0|As always, the performances are wonderful, selections great and his orchestra outstanding.
B0000033WC|5.0|I consider myself a hardcore Velvet Underground fan, and I absolutely love this album.  In fact, I am going to blaspheme and admit that I prefer it not only to the eponymous third album, but also the band's legendary debut (GASP!).  I realize Velvet Underground and Nico is one of the most influential albums of all time, and I listen to it a lot, but I like many of the songs on Loaded better.  (I don't think anything else the band did can touch the raw glory of White Light/White Heat). <br /> <br />Velvet Underground fans often complain that this album is less edgy and groundbreaking than their other three efforts.  I agree with this claim completely, and I think Loaded is the only album the band released that really sounds like a product of its era.  At the same time, I think 1969-1970 was an incredibly inspired time for music, so fitting into this era is a good thing.  1969 and 1970 witnessed a shift in the rock world away from psychedelia toward country and folk sensibilities.  1969 saw The Band release their second album, the Stones release the country-tinged Let It Bleed, and Dylan release the pure-country Nashville Skyline.  1970 featured Zeppelin's shift to folk with their third album.  Even the true champions of psychedelia, the Grateful Dead, released the folk rock classics Workingman's Dead and American Beauty in 1970.  Loaded stands up well amid these albums. <br /> <br />I also think I like this album because I typically listen to classic rock rather than the alternative rock many Velvet Underground fans prefer.  Along with the Velvet Underground, I would say the Rolling Stones and pre-'75 Grateful Dead are my favorite bands.  \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" are two of the greatest classic rock songs ever.  \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\" is almost as great, and the rest of the songs are better than filler to my ears (I love \\"Cool It Down,\\" contrary to many of the other reviewers).  And while the album lacks the alternative sound, some of the lyrics still hint at Lou Reed's cynicism (\\"Who Loves the Sun\\", \\"Train Round the Bend\\"). <br /> <br />There is no doubt in my mind that Loaded is far more accessible than the other three Velvet Undergound albums.  It is the one recording by the band that I think could appeal to many casual listeners.  People can quibble over whether this really is the Velvet Underground because of all the personnel changes, but that just draws attention away from the great music you will find here.  The extra tracks are a nice touch and worth the extra money, though not essential to most folks.  Still, any fan of the Velvet Underground (especially Lou Reed) or classic rock should check this album out.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|A REAL CLASSIC!  This was a Christmas gift that has not been delivered to her as of yet, so I can not speak for the viewing quality, however, I was VERY satisfied with the delivery time and the quality of the shipment. <br /> <br />Thank you so much Happy New Year!
B000002G7E|5.0|White Light/White Heat is what happens when a group of talented and original artists are given free reign to create whatever they want in an atmosphere that encourages experimentation.  I have a massive music collection covering everything from traditional Egyptian folk music to gangsta rap, and I have never encountered another album like this one.  It can be so rocking and groovy at times, yet so chaotic and dense at others.  It is also one of the few albums I own that I never find boring. <br /> <br />I'm not going to break the album down song-by-song because there is already plenty of that here on Amazon.  I will simply say that this album is not easy listening.  It is loud, chaotic, wild, rough, raw, and sometimes just downright weird.  Nonetheless, it is among my favorite albums ever. (I usually prefer much more mainstream fare.)  It features what has got to be one of the earliest recorded versions of what would eventually become known as punk, \\"I Heard Her Call My Name.\\"  It also features one of the craziest and hardest rocking songs I know of in the exhausting \\"Sister Ray.\\"  Heck, I'd be willing to bet even a lot of the people who say they don't like this song in other reviews still think the first five minutes of \\"Sister Ray\\" are killer.  And I do want to defend \\"The Gift.\\"  This is my favorite song on the album and among my favorite Velvet Underground songs period.  I don't think I could ever get sick of the way John Cale reads the story or the jam the band plays in the other channel. <br /> <br />This is not an album for casual music fans, or even casual fans of the Velvet Underground.  I have a lot of friends who love music and cannot stand anything on this album after the first track.  But if you are open-minded and willing to throw out your previous ideas about what a rock album can and should be, then White Light/White Heat could prove to be one of those rare albums that you enjoy more with each successive listen, just as it is for me.  Highly, highlyrecommended... but not to everyone.

0930289331|4.0|The very first Batman grapic novel I ever bought was The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.  Why not start off with what everyone says is the best?  But once I read it and realized it takes place years after Bruce Wayne Retires as Batman, I figured I'd better start back at the beginning.  I get a copy of Batman: Year One and once again it's by Frank Miller.   <br /> <br />It surprises me that both of these were written only a year apart, and that he wrote this one second.  While Dark Knight is definitely the darker of the two, it's also a much different kind of Bat story.  Of course the different artistic styles will be the first thing you'll notice seeing as Miller drew Dark Knight but left Year One to David Mazzucchelli, which in some ways I prefer over Miller's Sin City style. <br /> <br />But enough about Dark Knight.  Year One was great.  I must admit I read this after Batman Begins came out.  I wish I had read it first, I would have appreciated it more.  What I'm saying is Begins borrows heavily from this.  The novel starts once Bruce returns to Gotham.  Cut out the entire Ras Al Ghul, Bruce training back story.  Replace Scarecrow with Catwoman and you pretty much have the same thing.   <br /> <br />But what really makes it stand out from Batman Begins is Year One concentrates a lot more on James Gordon's struggles against his corrupt police department and almost makes him a main character by giving him the love interest instead of Bruce Wayne.  I can only hope we'll be seeing this side of Gordon in the next Bat movie, The Dark Knight.  Very appropriate title.

0783225547|5.0|\\"Dante's Peak\\" is one of the disaster movies that really brings the genre to a super peak, with a realistic and thrilling earth-shaking (in this case literally) catastrophe, high octane action, glorious cinematography capturing great natural beauty, and high-quality characters and relationships.  It is, of course, about a volcano, one of the most powerful forces in nature, and it successfully captures the grandeur and terror of such an event.  I've always found volcanoes fascinating - they're terrifically destructive, and of course tragic for the havoc they wreak, both when they're near human habitation and when they're in the 'isolated' wilderness where the other creatures are the sole recipients of their explosive force.  And yet they're undeniably beautiful, like a sunset or a howling snowstorm, and they're in fact an essential part of the inner workings of the earth.  Also, although there is often a lot of death associated with volcanoes as acre after acre gets burnt up or covered with ash, they're also, paradoxically, major bringers of life.  Even extremely barren, infertile lands with usually burst forth with new life within a few years of a volcano, because they bring forth such rich new nutrients in their lava. <br /> <br />   \\"Dante's Peak\\" is smart by not having the disaster hit five minutes after the opening credits have finished rolling; there have been some movies of this nature over the years that have made just that mistake.  This one though is perfectly paced throughout.  There is plently of tight build-up and a couple of tragic harbingers of the bigger calamity to come.  The action in the latter parts of the movie is explosive and exhilirating, among the best.  It's interesting that \\"Dante's Peak\\" has managed to position itself as one of the greatest action movies without any real bad guys.  There are some unlikable characters - short-sighted, arrogant, condescending - but that's all.  They're jerks, but they're not characters who are going to goout and kill somebody.  So in this tremendous action movie there's no one shooting at each other, no swordplay, no high-impact kick battles.  Don't get me wrong - I love the kind of movies represented by \\"Lethal Weapon\\", \\"Timebomb\\", \\"True Lies\\", \\"Out Of Time\\", all that; and I generally even more love the more fantastical, really grand movies like \\"Superman Returns\\", \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", all that stuff.  But it's neat that a movie missing so many of the great staples of action fare has also brought itself up into the cream of the crop. <br /> <br />   The visuals of \\"Dante's Peak\\" are awesome.  The volcanic effects are extremely realistic, and just the natural splendor is great.  As mentioned, the cinematography is incredible, although there is admittedly one wonderful shot that was promising to be truly spectacular but gets hampered a bit by the camera being in the wrong angle to capture it all.  A very minor quibble.  It would also be an extremely minor quibble if one was to spend too much time focusing on the improbably high number of razor-thin escapes by some of the characters.  Movie makers Are allowed some artistic licences even in realistic scenarios after all, and besides, in a case where two outcomes are possible but one quite a bit more likely, you don't have to go with the most likely one Every time.  You shouldn't also go with the most unlikely every time either or it loses its believability and tension, and \\"Dante's Peak\\" doesn't do that.  It stays on just the right tip of the balancing scale. <br /> <br />  Excellent stuff; for more disaster-oriented greats I also recommend \\"Deep Impact\\" and \\"Titanic\\".

0307237699|5.0|this book is refreshing in its transparent discussion of the political process and Barack's struggle at times to find meaningful positions and actions in our modern political climate
0618680004|1.0|As a monotheist, I want to criticize the following points about this book: <br />- most importantly, though there is a chapter with the title \\"religious experience\\", Dawkins only writes about sense experience which is then given an erroneous interpretation (e.g. Manx' shearwaters' squawks being interpreted as the voice of the devil, the apparition of a comet as a sign for domesday, etc.). Religious experience itself (such as is described in William James' classic \\"The Varieties of Religious Experience\\") is not discussed. If it were, Dawkins would have to attempt to develop criteria which would qualify a whole category of human experience, undergone all over the globe and by people from all walks of life, and in all religious traditions, as false. Dawkins doesn't even attempt to do this, suggesting that he is either unaware of the possibility of religious experience, or that he doesn't see a way of refuting it. <br />- the fact that the laws of physics are precisely as they need to be so as to bring about the apparition of life through the course of evolution - in other words, that the universe is \\"fine tuned\\" for life - is acknowledged (wow!). However, Dawkins rejects a scientific ivestigation into the intellectual consequences of the acknowledged facts by bringing in the \\"anthropic principle\\", stating that if the laws of physics were different, we would not be here to discuss the issue, and that therefore (??) any investigation as to why the laws of physics are \\"fine tuned\\" in such a way, is futile. The argument from parallel universes won't do, since these are in principle not verifiable and consequently there are no empirical findings supporting there existence - as opposed to the Lord, who has shown himself and has been experienced many times by many people. <br />- we are not told what precisely is supposedly wrong with the onotological argument. It is \\"refuted\\" only by drawing an analogy to another, obviously absurd, argument given on the following page. <br />- To prove how primitively theists think, Dawkins quotes e-mails he claims to have received from religious believers - something none of us can verify. There is no reference given for a quote which - Dawkin's claims - comes from the great Jewish philosopher Moses Ben Maimon. Not exactly scientific style, is it? <br />- The world's religions, especially Christianity, are presented in an obviously biased and prejudiced light - Dawkin's account is extremely selective, deliberately dropping a lot of information and hardly worthy of a scientist. Dawkin's doesn't seem to have read the Bible much -if he has, he seems to be deliberately omitting a great deal which doesn't fit into his picture. It is not acknowledged that the rejection of false human constructions, of gods whom one could slavishly bribe or influence and the imagination of which provides false security (of the golden calf and the wooden idols described by the prophets), in fact stems from the Bible itself, especially the prophetic writings, far more so than from greek philosophy. Negative and analogical theology are unknown to Dawkins, or at least not mentioned. He goes into the violence \\"religion\\" has committed, but fails to see that the concept of human dignity, without which there would have been no declaration of human rights(!), is inseparably linked to monotheism and the jewish-christian tradition. I therefore don't believe that this book is a contribution to world peace. \\"Scientific\\" materialism and determinism have brought us to the brink of ecological and social disaster - will we escape from it? Religious people are doing their bit in fighting for a fair world economy - I don't see much initiative there from the spokesmen of atheism. <br />- To say something positive: the book is fun to read, also for the religious believer. It is not educative in the sense of providing any new information, but its provocative style is entertaining - more like cabaret rather than science. <br />
B000MKIR80|5.0|If you like smart, deadpan humor, this movie is excellent.  Some of the greatest one and two liners I have ever heard.  I am a big fan of the srcastic dry humor (Monty Python, Douglas Adams, etc), so if you re going for the obvious laughs, this movie might be a bit too subtle and fast for you.
1577314808|1.0|ANOTHER BOOK THAT GOES ON AND SAYING THE SAME THING.       I COULD NOT GET IT. YOU CAN HAVE MY COPY. REALLY       YOU SHOULD TRY TO READ A FEW PAGES BEFORE BUYING       THIS ONE.
1401308201|5.0|As a huge fan of the broadway show \\"Wicked\\" I just had to have my own copy of The Grimmerie.  It is fabulously loaded with information about the book, the thought process behind the scenes, all of the music, the actors everything about the musical that intrigued me.  I love the photo's.  There are days that I'd love to be able to cast some spells like Elphaba and Glinda. \\"Because I knew you, I have been changed for good.\\"  You'll love this book.
1881273156|5.0|This is not just applicable to marraige or romance but, to all relationships.
B000GIXEIG|4.0|Loved this movie. The story was much like the ancient poem but Gerard Butler made Beowulf so human that you could feel the growing distaste for killing and the wondering why it was neccessary. The Icelandic scenery was so awesome. How is any place on Earth still so pristine and  <br />natural? This movie is not for kids but adults should enjoy it.
0743487486|5.0|The title says it all.   Really enlightening w/o being dull or preachy.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a very pleasant CD to listen to.  Knopfler & Harris's voices compliment one another nicely.  I wasn't disappointed and would recommend it to my friends.
B000H5U832|5.0|We love, love, love the movie and the price we received from Amazon....Thank you!!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I'm a 60 year old female who loves Veronica Mars!  Don't have time to watch during the week, so love watching TV shows on DVD.  I just wish I had been as spunky as Veronica when I was in high school.  All the characters grow and change throughout the season. I love all the plot twists and turns.  Each week, Veronica solves some \\"minor\\" mystery and chips away at solving some season- lasting puzzler.  Big and small cast parts are played wonderfully, and Veronica frequently gets to exact revenge over someone who had 'wronged' her.  Great fun!
B00004RJ74|4.0|The movie was fast paced the way I like them.  Quentin could have been killed off early because he was just too sadistic.  The scene at the bar was a bit over kill, but hey, it's just a movie.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Is this film perfect? No. Is it fascinating, unsettling and dark? Yes. Those qualities don't by themselves equal a good movie, but Chris Nolan has done a splendid job of taking an excellent, but cinematically challenging novel and molding it into a fine film. Read Christopher Priest's award-winning book \\"The Prestige,\\" and you'll appreciate just how many original concepts and new writing went into the film script. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both perfectly cast. The reviewer who wrote that the film has \\"nothing to do with magic or magicians\\" must have seen a completely different movie! And David Bowie does a super job of bringing the brilliant Nikola Tesla, the \\"father of electricity\\" to life.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|The fact that this film saw the light of day in our society where smoking more and more becomes somewhat a taboo is already a miracle and a merit of its creators. This movie should have been done especially after Michael Mann's The Insider, just to show us the \\"other side\\", to hear arguments of the people who have a right to be heard as everyone else in any free country. And in its cynicism and recklessness Thank You For Smoking came out to be extremely ruffian-like and hilarious as for example People VS Larry Flynt or Private Parts. You can't resist admiring this picture as girls usually can't resist bad guys' charm. What's even more preposterous and outrageous, but inevitable I guess, is that you feel empathy for Aaron Eckhart's character, a character who earns money by persuading people into smoking, who profits from others' misery if you will. You like his character. I just loved him! He is smart enough to prove his point even if he's wrong, more than that - he's smart enough to persuade people to do something they absolutely don't need to do. He's the ultimate puppeteer, a Dr. Evil. You'll ask how it is possible to admire such person? But see, he doesn't put cigarettes into anyone's mouth, people do it themselves, and only they are to blame. We usually tend to blame everyone else in our misfortune, but it's us and only us who is responsible. I smoke myself, but if I get ill of it I'll never start blaming a tobacco industry - I have my own head on my shoulders to make decisions. In another words if people are fools it's nobody's fault except their own. And if you can manupulate people with a spoken word you're a genious, and I personally admire such persons. And this film is not about proving the point that smoking is good, Aaron Eckhart's character says himself he doesn't think smoking is good, he just thinks everybody is entitled to his own opinion and has a right to share it with others. It's parents' and schools' business to educate and teach to distinguish right from wrong.<br /><br />There was only one thing that seemed strange at first glance in this film. Just imagine - it's a movie about smoking, but there's no single person smoking on screen throughout the entire picture! Was that an attempt to make the flick politically correct or director Jason Reitman's deliberate concept? I think it's rather the second, and if it's really like this it's extremely funny. I also had a feeling about the film trying to seem politically correct, when Aaron Eckhart's character quit his job as a tobacco lobbyist in the end. But moments later we see him explaining to some executives in a mobile phones company there is no evidence phones cause brain tumor. Long live the cynicism!right from wrong.

B000AYQJJ2|5.0|An oldie but a goodie.  Great quality due to the remastering and it is great to see these music superstars in concert over twenty years ago. Peace.
B000J103PC|1.0|Excellant movie. Saw it on the circuit. The reason I give it 1 star is because the wide screen does not work in South Africa. A freind of mine bought the full screen version and it works. <br /> <br />Regards <br /> <br />Kurt.
0552151696|1.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and this one is the worst. I think Dan Brown readers are used to flat characters, exaggerated and impossible situations and casually researched topics BUT good suspense and fast-paced, easy readable action makes you come back to his books.     However, in Digital Fortress Dan Brown just lost the plot. If anyone thought the characters in Angels & Demons were flat then you will be in for another hurtful surprise. The amount of stereotyping and lack of character development in this book is just too much.     Also, the way Dan Brown incorporates his research on cryptography into the story is done oddly. He adapts a lecture-like narrative (which may work sometimes but not all the time) that completely detracts from the story and reminds you of reading some uni text books. If you are remotely familiar with the concepts of cryptography, don't read the book because there is nothing else to be gained.     If you want to read one of his better books go for Deception Point.
B00005JOHC|5.0|This show is just way too much, WOW, we really enjoy seeing how they work the title into the conversation, BERTA is outstanding, we laugh so much we cry, CHARLIE is just outta sight great, ALAN plays a dimbo/nerd/square effortlessly, but we are thankful you dropped his bimbo second wife, and the kid JAKE is coming along just fine, ROSE is spacey/intelligent, but sweet, the MOTHER is just terrific as always, whatever she is starring in, she is too much. We look forward to Monday nights, the reruns are as good as watching it the first time, I have satellite and watch the early east feed and the late west feed, usually record it and watch it at lunch the next day with friends, it is the conversation topic for Tuesday, USA please get us the DVDs soon, we want our \\"Two and a Half Men\\" in our DVD library.  Can't tell you how many people we have turned on to this show, but it is quite a few.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Exorcism of Emily Rose is such a great movie! It's well put together. The cast is amazing! This movie is worth buying and watching over and over.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this game for my first grade class.  After reviewing it I was hooked and bought one for my grandchildren, ages 12, 10 and 7.  They became hooked!  My friends all purchased their own too.  Blokus is easy to learn; easy enough for a 6 year old to play but challenging for adults who search for the best strategy to use to block their opponent and use all of their game pieces.  I highly recommend the game for all ages.
6302886228|5.0|Excellent concert.   Played so many times I m afraid to continue playing it for fear it will \\"wear out\\".   Where is the DVD???????
B00005QW5X|5.0|Loved this when it came out, lost my 1st copy to a \\"friend\\" who \\"borrowed\\" it.  Cried through a whole car ride alone listening to the soundtrack and had to get it again!
B000I5X81K|5.0|My wife and I cannot get enough of Josh Groban.  After seeing him in concert, we jump on any opportunity to hear any of his new music. This CD is a great one, hopefully, we will be cranking out several more in '07 and '08.

0689849109|5.0|You've heard \\"Pollyanna\\" forever and think you know what it means. But, unless you've read the book, you don't. Yes, Pollyanna is an optimist - but not blindly. This delightful, loving girl creatively and courageously looks for the good beneath the bad, sad or depressing. Key here (which most don't know or leave out): she first sees and experiences the negative. She does not ignore it. She herself is tested in the end and fails at her usual optimism for months before finally finding the vision and willingness to hope again. A wonderful book for young and old alike. Last year I gave it to my 12-year-old niece for her birthday - and read it myself for the first time. This year I gave it to everyone on my Christmas list - to create a fabulous Pollyanna world. Will you join?
B0009QBLA8|5.0|I will watch it the 7th time in 3 weeks tonight.
0670034711|5.0|Because I found so much to relate to in this book.  Anyone who has been divorced knows the pain whether you leave or are the one who is left.  Pain is pain and people deal with it differently.  I love the way this author uses wit and self-deprecation to describe her story.  I never once thought she was telling us, the readers, that we have to travel to deal with our own stuff, so I'm not sure where the other readers got that from the book.  It was just her story about her journey.  Not everyone would even want or need to do what she did, but I found it fascinating all the same.  I've told many friends about this book.  It made me laugh out loud and even cry a few times.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|so i cant listen to it too much, nor every track, but its pretty damn good for bob dylan
B000000Y87|5.0|I read a lot about this, and thought it couldn't be that good. It is. \\"Waltz for Debby\\" is even finer. This was Genius at work.
0441013597|5.0|Truly this is one of, if not THE BEST book I have ever read.  It was recommended to me and I've passed it along.  Any reasonably intelligent person can tell that the writer was brilliant and gifted.  It upsets me that Herbert died before he could write the prequel books his son interpretted.  It is not a \\"and then he said... and then she said...\\" kind of book.  The writing draws you into the story.  And what a story it is!  Herbert created an entire universe that rivals that of star wars or any other.  I was fully impressed by the attention to detail in character developement, politics, old feuds, economics, environtmental developement.  The Bene Gesserit alone make the story worthwhile.  When words cannot do justice, we say, \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />I reread this book periodically just because it is so worth my time.  Good reading for anyone who can appreciate a masterpiece.  Enjoy.
B000000YBQ|5.0|The reviews look a bit excessive, don't they? They're not. Wonderful beyond words.
B000001EMW|5.0|Well done.  Be sure to check out Inquisition Symphony for a couple more Metallica songs including the alltime favorite, Nothing Else Matters.  It sounds amazing on cellos.  Please buy.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|In the late 70's I listened to KZOK-FM in Seattle, and they had a concert reviewer they called Mavis the Morning After. I remember her review of a Springsteen concert -- she simply said, \\"I'm speechless.\\" I was 17 or so at the time and had no idea what that was all about. But, some 30 years later, after watching the live concert that is packaged with this reissue, I understand.<br /><br />Although I love the album, I'm not sure I get the point of remastering the muddy production of Born to Run, and the included documentary is too long and self-congratulatory. But if you are any kind of a Springsteen fan you should buy this reissue for the concert DVD. It is incredible.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|What a fabulous, moving, touching, heart-felt and funny movie! This is a true gem of a film; one of those that comes along so rarely and leaves you feeling so happy for having been able to experience it.  <br /> <br />This movie tells the story of a disconnected (and yes, \\"dysfunctional\\") family coming together to help one member - Olive - accomplish her goal of competing in the Little Miss Sunshine contest. The cast of characters deliver brilliant performances - from Olive's older brother who has taken a vow of slience, to her uncle who has unsuccessfully committed suicide, to her self-indulgent motivational speaking father who is in complete denial of the fact that his goals will not be reached, to her mother who tries her best of keep the family together and accept each member for who they are, to the drug-addicted, no-holds-barred grandfather, and finally Olive who is so innocent and such a remarkably confident individual for her age- she truly steals the movie and your heart. <br /> <br />This is not a \\"chick flick\\" by any means...I recommend it to men and women of all ages, although it is not particularly geared towards young children.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|this is a movie about a self obsessed man who through trial and mostly error , deceit , bullying gains rise above his social status. his triumphs are only mirrored by the tragedys.based on a thackery novel, stanley kubrick makes his most perfect film here , if a bit too long the dialogue is authentic , the symbolism , frightening, and the ending tragic/comical.scenes to watch for include the look on captain feeneys face , a leering sneer of a highwayman complete with broken bottle specs and cold sores on his lips.almost hallucinogenic .barry lyndon is a man who will stop at nothing to create his own world and then lose it . the most unforgettable scene is the climactic duel between him and his son, most intense. a gem of a film .
1581806574|5.0|this book was a great help to me. i was never very good at drawing dragons but now i think i should start posting my art a an art site. i highly reccomend this book.

B000FIMG68|5.0|We watched the complete second season in seven evenings....just couldn't stop at one episode per night. The entire family is hopelessly addicted to \\"Lost.\\"
B0000524CY|5.0|This is one of, if not THE, freakiest movie of all time, and that's saying something considering the horror movies that have been released since The Exorcist was in theaters.  I wanted this DVD for my collection, and \\"The Version You've Never Seen\\" certainly was just that, with some very disturbing scenes and subliminal frames.  Horror movie fans should absolutely have this one in their collection.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|This documentary, though it could have been edited a bit better, nails down the facts about global warming. It would be useful to watch along with the HBO documentary \\"Too Hot Not To Handle,\\" as the two complement each other. They leave no doubt that global warming is real, serious and very much in need of being addressed as a priority. What we're NOT doing is detailed in other documentaries, such as \\"Who Killed the Electric Car?\\" If you see a scientist on TV talking about the \\"debate\\" over global warming, implying that there is no scientific consensus on the subject, you are watching a lobbyist.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is one of those \\"albums\\" that doesn't get old listening to it over and over becuse there are no turkeys. Great background music for a party. I gave it as a Christmas present to my son and son-in-law and they loved it too. Simply good stuff!
B00004SZWD|5.0|A musical 'Genious' at his best!  Very soulful, very romantic, very jazzy and fun.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Edwardian upper class mores with a few loose seams showing.  Well acted and an insight into the upstairs/downstairs master and servant relationship that existed in England just before World War I.  Ultimately the characters are so confined by their class that they are like silk flowers trying to pass for the real thing if only they had the courage.  Worth seeing once, but only once unless you have an analytical mind that doesn't mind the emotional surface aridity of this film.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Of course it is GREAT! Though I was under the impression that this version was in color, it wasn't so I had to decline this purchase. I will be purchasing the DVD when it becomes available in COLOR!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Seeing this should be a requirement in all of our schools. Fantastic film; it really makes you want to do something. I saw this for the first time at college and I immediately pre-ordered it for my parents. It's unfortunate that many people are so cynical about environmental issues, because we truly have a problem on our hands.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|How I ever found out about IL Divo was from a t.v. commercial. Those voices captured my interest right away and I went to Amazon, my favorite place to buy from and ordered it. It was called \\"Siempre\\" and I was very anxious to get it. There was no disappointed there. It was the most beautiful singing that I have heard from four of the greatest singers. Once you hear \\"Siempre\\", You, like me will want to buy more of their great c.d.'s.  <br />I recently purchased their video, \\"Live At The Greek Theater\\". I loved it so much that I ordered two more, one for a gift for a friend and another for myself to keep as a spare.  <br />I highly recommend that you buy \\"Siempre\\". *****
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series. well plotted so give it a try and if you like it you will love serenity the movie
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Her voice is very easy to listen to.You can`t go wrong with her.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|The finest war movie ever made, in my opinion. The acting overall is superb. The realism is frightening and the horrors of war bring one into the real world that war is truly hell. This version is far superior to abridged versions and should be seen in it's entirety.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Once again fantastic. His voice is amazing,I could listen to this cd 24/7. I don`t think you could go wrong with any of his music, he just keeps getting better and better and to think he`s really only just begun.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A much needed film - I hope it is watched by millions.  In a scientific, yet entertaining way, he shows us not only the effects and consequences of global warming, but shares, in a modest, honest way, a bit of his personal journey too. Watch it to the very end - in there with the credits are a score of easy, practical suggestions for what each of us can do on a daily basis.
B000I5X81K|4.0|While none of his CDs can compare to his first, this CD definitely contains some classic Groban songs. It also contains (toward the end of the CD especially) some new sides of Groban - some eclectic music choices.
067088278X|5.0|My mom used to read this book to my two sisters and me.  Now I read it to my son and I purchased copies for my sisters for Christmas.  The pictures and the 'I Spy' aspect are wonderful and the rhymes are fun.  A great book!
0553103547|5.0|As far as I am concerned, their has been only one truly great fantasy series written, Lord of the Rings, until this came along.  Even at over 1000 pages this book is only the tip of a huge story being told by Martin in his Song of Ice and Fire series. Written for the adult fantasy fan, this book has it all, adventure, danger, great characters, sex, violence deceit, creatures, villians, hero's, kings, queens, conspiracy, and the promise of Dragons later in the series.  No, this isn't like LOTR, not necessarily a \\"quest\\" adventure, but definitely for those of us who have loved the genre, grown up, and are still wanting to escape to mythological lands and times. And the good news is, each book in the series lives up to and surpasses the last.  Word of advice to the reader: don't be frustrated by the introduction of new characters throughout the series, you'll get to know and love/hate them as much as the characters you believe to be the primary players, and...try not to fall in love with any of them too much, this is an author with the courage to kill off any cast member, at any time.  No one is sacred, characters you have come to love will die, and that infuses the reading experience with a sense of eager anticipation and fear for your favorite character, and the danger of the realm is certainly palpable.  Yes, buy it.
B000687M48|4.0|I must say that I love Evanescence and Amy Lee's angelic voice. I have a large selection of their work even back to the demo days. I was very much looking foward to seeing them play live on the dvd because I haven't been able to see them in person. The only thing is that I bought the dvd to see them play live not to see how well the guy behind the camera could make me dizzy moving the camera around so fast you couldn't focus on watching the band play. Between that and the added special effects it really made it hard to enjoy seeing the band in action. If I wanted to just hear the band I could've just listened to my cds.  <br />Don't get me wrong though, I was very glad I got the DVD because any Evanescence fan should have it in their collection,the music videos are very good! I am very much looking forward to another live DVD by Evanescence,I just hope this time they let someone film the concert and put the final cut together that lets you enjoy how fantastic the band is without all the added effects that take away from you being able to enjoy seeing them and their great show!
B000063UR2|5.0|If you like fairy tales and happy endings, this is the movie for you!
B000750OEA|4.0|She has done a lot of great work over the years.  If you like Kylie Minogue this DVD should definitely be a part of your collection.
0783225482|5.0|This movie first came out when I was about 11 years old.  I remember going into the cinema in the local mall (which was torn down LONG ago) and seeing carboard cutouts of Hawn, Willis, and Streep.  Of course, I had no idea who they were, but the image of Willis's hand going through Hawn's stomach is tough to forget.<br /><br />I also remember seeing a TV special on the making of this movie, because at that time the special effects used were ultra-high-tech.<br /><br />Of course I didn't see the movie in the theater.  I was awful young.  A few years after its theatrical run (maybe two) somebody in my family saw this movie on sale at Randall's as a used video and bought it at a discount.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, particularly because at that point I'd seen nothing where the major theme centered around a fountain of youth.  It's a fascinating concept when done well, as done here.<br /><br />The plot's unusual: Two bitter woman rivals obsessed with vanity drink a magical potion that keeps them young forever, so no matter what awful things they do to one another, they remain alive, even after they're classified as clinically dead.  Unfortunately, their bodies take quite a beating and need the upkeep of a plastic surgeon.  So they try to get Dr. Ernest Menville (Willis) to drink the potion too.  There's a lot more to the story, actually, since Dr. Menville has had very intimate relationships with both women in the past.  The build-up of this story is quite beautiful, although a bit sketchy when addressing Hawn's party at the beginning.<br /><br />I'll close by saying that there are a few scenes of nude female behinds every now and then.  Whoa.
0060899190|5.0|There is a lot of mental and visual stimulation throughout this book.  This is a great coffee table book.  My friends come over and flip through it, and they think it's very interesting as well.
B000I0QK74|5.0|Excellent CD, especialy if you are a JT fan.  Nice covers of familiar tunes and some new ones that are very inspiring.  Many of his arrangements are familiar so this puts some people off, but if you like his style, this is a great holiday CD.
B000I0QK74|4.0|I love James Taylor's voice. It was nice listening to him sing Christmas carols.
B000H5U832|5.0|My son has watched this movie over and over since he got it at Christmas. Even for the hundred millionth time, it is still a nice movie for adults to watch. It also has a great message. A must add to your DVD collection!
0763621803|5.0|Christmas gift for my 9-year old niece...Easy order process and quick delivery! <br /> <br />Thanks, Thanks, Thanks!
B00000251N|5.0|fantastic cd.  I have loved this for years, had it on an album and on my desktop.  just had to have it.  is the most haunting and lovely sounds, really relaxing, mellow music.  really helps me get back on track when I have had a bad day.
B000002H70|5.0|Honestly, I've never been a Cure fan considering I purchased their greatestt hits album and was somewhat disappointed. Sure, there were a few good songs on their  greatest hits album, but \\"Disintegration\\" is not the same case at all! I purchased this album upon a friends recommendation and I was incredibly pleased and in awe of Robert Smith's genius. This album is not upbeat, fun, Cure pop, it's a journey through heart-break that is so enthralling and captivating I can't stop listening to it!  I consider this to be a classic album not only for The Cure, but in general.<br /><br />The most upbeat song on the album is \\"Love Song\\" (I'm positive you know this song) but songs such as the title track, \\"Lullaby\\", \\"Prayers For Rain\\", and \\"Pictures Of You\\" are the true gems on this album.  Robert Smith's talent shines through on each track.<br /><br />I can't recommend this album to you enough.  I am extremely discriminating when it comes to music, and it is so hard to find an album  from an artist that resonates originality, honesty, and has you going back for a listen continuously.<br /><br />I do consider myself a casual Cure fan, but if there is one album you must own from The Cure, this is it! It got me hooked on them, and I have been pleased ever since.
B00005JPCA|5.0|I don't suspect you expect me to retell the story? You can read that in other people's reviews.<br />Its a new kind of Bond movie. Done in Bourne-style almost-realism.<br />Blonde Bond.. is different. Not better than old Bonds we loved for their absence of any realism in either script, special effects, Bond skills or MI5 toys and gadgets. Just different.<br />Whether you are old Bond fan or not, I don't believe you will leave the movie theatre in any way disappointed.<br />Story holds water most of the time.<br />No doubt Craig is a good actor, thou not really my type :D<br />Mikkaelsen extremely sexy villain with his little screwed up teeth and curled lip.<br />All in all, one of the best Bonds ever!
0060007737|5.0|I believe Al Reis is one of the most important contributors to the principles of marketing as we know. I read this book and his other book about Laws of Marketing years ago. I still think the ideas in these books are timeless. I still browse them from time to time to refresh my memory. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to be a businessman or successful in their careers. I believe it is a neccessity to learn about the principles of branding and marketing in today's business world wether you are in marketing, advertising or finance. Easy to read, great to learn.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell is genius in this little gem and James Caan is the perfect scrooge until he experiences a change of heart. The scene in the newsroom will have you rolling as will the fight in the department store. Lots of good cheer and redemptive messages in this movie but to me it was not overly saccharine. Enjoy with some popcorn and snuggle close to a loved one.
B000274THQ|5.0|Goodbye Lenin shows how young adults viewed reunification, contrasting modern Germany with the ideals of the DDR throughout the film in funny and endearing ways. Additionally, the love story in the movie adds some interesting dynamics to the witty plot. <br /> <br />highly recomended.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Absolutely stellar album. Long time Maiden fan, have all their albums. This album is infinitely listenable. Every song just kicks... and kicks hard! Fantastic melody lines, killer musician-manship... every band member is firing on all cylinders (esp. Nicko).    I listen to it all the time without ever feeling I \\"am not in the mood\\" for it!  There is a song for every mood and taste.    Worth the purchase, folks. Seriously.

I've purchased every form of it (book, audio and DVD) and have shared it with countless people who are continally thanking me for changing their lives.  I've even shared it with my young kids who seem to \\"get it\\" more than some adults!  The message here applies to EVERYONE and is both inspiring and thought provoking.

It applies to everyone and shares wisdom that everyone would benefit to know.  I highly recommend it in any form (book or dvd) and as one to revisit many times over.  A great gift idea too!

B0001I561E|5.0|This movie is so great.  I have been very much in a Disney mood lately.  I love having it on DVD, too, and it does not matter if it is the special edition or not.  The movie itself is special...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|As I watched this DVD, companion to a fine book let me add, I kept thinking that while some critics exist who try (on occasion even eloquently) to pick apart An Inconvenient Truth, is there anyone out there who really thinks polluting our planet as we do is a good thing?<br /><br />The former Vice President does not rant here, does not raise his voice, and under his quiet tone the facts are left to speak for themselves. The unwanted message of this extraordinary film is this: it is up to us to save ourselves. There was a time when people truly did not know about the cause and effect reality of we mere humans having such a drastic impact on something as colossally large as our planet, but we no longer have the excuse of ignorance. If we do not change our destructive practices, not only will we pay for it in ways almost too horrible to contemplate, but so will many generations yet unborn.<br /><br />The best and most daunting aspect of the entire Gore presentation was when the collateral effects of global warming were highlighted. Sure, we all know it could get much hotter, but the consequences of this, the most severe climatic shift in at least 600,000 years, would also be felt in increased storms, droughts, famines, plagues, desertification, the alteration of entire coastlines, and no doubt, to extend thinking a little further, those alive after the melting of the polar glaciers would find themselves locked in internecine wars with the prize being the remnants of whatever resources remained in a world where everything we knew was suddenly greatly different.<br /><br />I hate to sound evangelical about much of anything, but An Inconvenient Truth is the best messenger yet for getting the facts out there, and for that reason, I hope this film is translated into a score of languages and shown on television, before classrooms, groups, churches, wherever possible, so that we can do whatever it takes to stop the ongoing irresponsible misuse of our extremely finite world. This is not a liberal versus conservative matter, it's about human survival.<br /><br />Easily five stars.e world. This is not a liberal versus conservative matter, it's about human survival. <br /> <br />Easily five stars.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorites and is one of the best classics of all time.
B000002GBB|5.0|In many ways \\"Pieces of Eight\\" is the finest of all Styx albums. Overall it even outdoes \\"The Grand Illusion\\" which many consider to be Styx's finest work.  The tracks 6-10 are in my opinion the best side of Styx ever.  Tommy Shaw tears it up on both \\"Blue Collar Man\\" as well as \\"Renegade\\" and Deyoung has two of his most underrated tracks on the album in \\"Queen of Spades\\" and \\"Pieces of Eight.\\"  This album has a great mix of melody and crackling guitar which is sadly missing on \\"Cornerstone\\" which sounds like it could not have come from the same decade never mind a year later!  Other later releases would include the so-so \\"Paradise Theater\\" which was at least a step up from Cornerstone,  and the dreadful \\"Killroy was Here\\" when Deyoung and his ballad fettish put the nails in the coffin but good for these guys.  I guess this is what makes this album a great one.  A final time when the band ran on all cylinders and were at the peak of their creativity.  Not many bands stay that way for long.  Styx was no exception.
0634022296|5.0|Exactly what I expected.  I'm a bit of a returning novice and the songs that I recognise, well it helps my working on chord changes and developing the proper strum rhythm and sound, because I know what I think it oughta sound like.  Sound great on my electric and most even better on my acoustic.  I consider it a beginner bit and fun book.  Aside from some Christian rock, some country, some classic rock, and a bit of what I play around with on my own, I spend about 60% of my time trying to move from among the chords in these songs.  Quite worth whatever I paid for it and shipped and received promptly.
B0002B15XI|5.0|People are human. This movie shows how humans put into very dangerous and bad situations can rip, tear and put back together. It shows the resiliancy of the human spirit. Even though the actors weren't the most well known at the time, they have proved their strength in the characters. The characters are smart, witty and easily identifiable with. This is a movie you should not miss.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The concert that was put on for the memory of the late George Harrison was terrific.  All the musical greats that George worked with were on-hand.  The personal touch of having this concert being put on by his wife and his son makes it a family event to his life, professionally AND personally. <br /> <br />The DVD here has captured this event well.  I have watched it many times now and still enjoy it as much.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in music, whether a fan of George Harrison or just music of that era.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This rates high among the classic's, not only suited for all ages but also <br />leaves a good image and point the story tells. Truly a classic.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a fun game of thinking using strategies to block others on the board. It is a game that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  It can be played in groups or individually. I would definitely recommend this game.  The only drawback is that it took almost 3 weeks to arrive.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris has written a great critique of 'blind faith' and the 'moderate faith' that covers for its many wrong doings. This book is concisely written extensively researched and should appeal to a wide audience from hard atheists to moderate believers. Harris is an intelligent man who with a sound understanding of both the historical background and modern implications of religious faith. What's refreshing about Sam is that (in my view) he isn't overly hindered by political correctness or an overtly political or anti-Christian bias: Islam, Chomsky, the Pope etc. all receive a fair share of rational thought and criticism.    I suspect that fundamentalist Evangelicals or Muslims won't like this book one bit; but than again, the chances of people from that audience cracking open this book are pretty slim.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I actually had my husband pick up this movie after seeing it was released when I checked my amazon site. It peaked my interest with the other reviews I read, so we rented it. WOW! You can bet we will be purchasing this soon!<br /><br />The movie warms the heart and breaks it in just a few short minutes of watching the film. All about a poor boy in love with a rich, powerful girl. You become surprised, amused, and even shocked during the rest of the film, during which Edward Norton does a FANTASTIC job! I was a little leary of this movie because I am not a huge Jessica Biel fan, but she did an amazing job, and you soon fall in love with her, and get lost during the rest of the movie.<br /><br />It has a great plot, and an even better twist at the end!!! BE SURE TO PICK THIS UP!!!!
B00003CXBK|4.0|I bought this movie for my two sons (12 & 13 yrs old). They loved it and they recommend it highly.
B000H30B2C|5.0|I LOVED this film and only saw it for the first time in my life on this DVD with all the extra scenes I never would have seen at the movies-- and paid more to see to boot!  (My credit-card company gave me a $20 discount on Amazonia which came in real handy here.)  Naturally, the extra background and production content made this thing a real steal, but I have yet to see any of that in favor of watching the near-3-hour-long flick itself 3 times so far.  That's the ONLY kind of DVD worth investing in anyway... one you could watch 25 times till you memorize every bit of dialog and scenery... and then watching it another 80 times!  Like The Wizard of Oz! <br /> <br />This Remake has plenty of reverence for the original and has an exceptional level of coherent internal logic; it leaves less glaring continuity errors than any sci-fi/horror/adventure epic-picture I've seen in a long time.  It won't give you the same raised-hair-on-the-back-of-your-neck suspense and dread of the Original, but what will?  Dig those modern special effects!  ...even though, like all recent CGI (except the Jurassic Park fare), the beasties MOVE WAY TOO FAST.  Good thing you can slow things down with a DVD machine. <br /> <br />Say, maybe that's why the first 'Kong was so much more frightening and impressive:  All that jerky, deliberate motion made a far more spooky impact than blur-fast animation...?  But, if that's true, how come Godzilla-puppetry only makes us laugh? <br /> <br />GET this DVD! <br />

B000ASDFJU|5.0|This series is very well written, directed and acted.  It is thought provoking and protrays real life situations.  The plot, or should I say plots, are complex and deep without being abstract.  It, of course, addresses moral issues without being judgemental. <br />Both I and my wife enjoy this series very much.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby does it again. He takes a huge subject and makes it easy and fun to understand.

After purely looking at all the pictures the first time through, the words seemed almost unnecessary going through it again. A fine piece of work, and one of the few books I own that will grace my coffee table for all to enjoy.

0140449337|5.0|Marcus Aurelius, philosopher-king of Rome for two decades, preserved his experiences not for posterity but likely for himself. A reminder of things past forming a deeply personal philosophy to guide the future. Solidly founded in Stoicism yet borrowing from cynicism, epicureanism and platonic thought the \\"Meditations\\" is a unique man's thoughts and experiences. Hardly original it is nonetheless, potent and applicable. <br /> <br />The main themes of the book can be summed up: <br /> <br />Experience as much as you can and interpret these experiences as honestly as you can. <br />Do what you can with what you have been given. <br />Do not fret over that which you cannot control..accept it. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite quotes: <br /> <br />Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly. <br /> <br />Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too-ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing early succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth. <br /> <br />
B000GYI32M|5.0|My daughter loves the O.C. series. I must admit that it is great !!!
B00005NTN5|4.0|It's a pretty fair action movie - a \\"stealing from the mob\\" plot, with claustrophic indoor settings. Suspense is good, despite and because of big fat clues in the very first scene. The balance of power tips back and forth at a pace that just increases to the very end.<br /><br />It has pretty characters, too. Violet is the trophy broad, all young curves, heels, and knit minidresses with hems high and necklines low. Corky, the wiry ex con, looks just as good in her cargo pants and sleeveless T-shirts. The movie's real claim to fame is a few brief scenes of hot snogging between these hot ladies early on. Jeez, what a way to get guy's attention. The mob film was pretty good, but those early scenes kept distracting me even an hour after they were over.<br /><br />The movie is mostly about suspense, with high-strung but not high-budget tension. It's pretty good in that respect even though my taste usually runs in other directions. What I'll remember is those few early minutes of Corky and Violet getting steamy on each other.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JNS0|2.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband who is a nascar fan.  When it arrived I sat down to view it with him.  I only watched it for a short time before I was completely bored.  My husband said it got better but I wasn't there to verify that, so maybe it does.
B000002LRX|5.0|starkly insightful, bone crushing lyrics with heavily layered and textured melodies.  \\"I started this, its all for me, what's yours is mine and mine is mine that's plain to see\\" provides insight into how some people gbdc actually do think.  other songs give the same insight on everything from middle age ennui to remorse to the oppressive nature of addiction.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Discovering beefheart thru his work with the great Frank Zappa I of course started with Trout Mask.  Don't get me wrong that album is a great piece of avant garde music, however it is not easy to listen to.  Safe as Milk is much more accessible, Beefheart's vocals are more rythmic, and the band is excellent.  This is truely a hidden gem for people who like classic rock and are interested in something diffrent than radio heavy bands.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|YES I KNOW MY OPION OF THIS MOVIE BEING GOOD ISN'T FELT ALL AROUND. IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD HIT BACK IN 2000 WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I WATCHED THE DVD PROBABLY 10 TIMES. THE BLU-RAY VERSION WAS EYE POPPING! THE VISUALS WERE CLEAR AND CRISP. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE VISUALLY WAS GREAT SOUND WAS OK NOT REALLY A BIG UPGRADE. THE COLORS WERE BRIGHT, BOLD, AND DETAILED EVEN DURING THE CHASE AS WELL. IF YOUR  A FAN OF THE MOVIE AND HAVE A BLU-RAY PLAYER OF A PS3 THEN UPRGRADE. THE MOVIES ARE STILL A LITTLE PRICEY FOR BLU-RAY BUT THIS IS ONE TI9TLE THATS WORTH IT!!

B00001OH7N|5.0|This is a must own for anyone interested in David Bowie's work. David Bowie trailblazed many uncharted areas, taking risks with a great passion and creativity. This album has incredible bass lines working perfectly with Bowie's voice and instrumentation. The lyrics and melodies make you want to give up song writing, never mind the great guitar lines. I am a huge David Bowie fan, so I'll I can say is how fricking awesome he is. If you are interested in people in music that defined sounds that you hear repeated today, then you should definitely check this out. This album is well rounded considering that it gets heavy at parts and at the same time has quiet well thought out parts intertwining all together. Good luck not losing your socks over this album.
B000I0QK74|5.0|An excellent selection of Christmas songs, done very well by JT. All Taylor fans must include this in their collection, as well as Christmas song lovers in general. There is something for everyone. He does a great cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", and a beautiful version of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\".
B00006RAKP|5.0|Great cd of many of Elton's numerous hits. A goldmine for someone like me who's been an Elton fan from the beginning. The early songs bring back memories of his two concerts I went to in the 70s...to see Elton in concert is a real treat!
B00000K19E|5.0|...that probably hasn't already been said? <br /> <br />It's a great movie, one that leaves you wondering about the reality of life.  But then, I'm sure that's been said, too.  Well, I enjoyed it.  By now, I'm pretty sure you've made up your mind to whether or not you feel the same. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, I am very surprised.  But, if that's the case, I can make this recommendation: watch this one and forget the other two exist.  As a stand-alone movie, it was great.  The sequels, well, how to put this lightly....sucked.  I understand that such language probably isn't necessary in a respectable review, but I really can't think of any other way to put it. <br /> <br />But this isn't a review about :Reloaded or :Revolutions, is it? <br /> <br />Simply put, a departure from a lot of other action movies out there.  It was a refreshing change.  Well directed, good story line, and exceptionally successful, even with the surprising and welcome lack of a superfluous and unneccessary nude scene (thank you very much :Reloaded for proving that you somehow feel obligated to throw it in there anyway).  It just proves that a good storyline goes a long way. <br /> <br />Where has this review gone?  I have no idea.  But hey, it might help someone.  And to that person I say, \\"you're welcome!\\"
B000E5KJHA|3.0|This version is not what I was expecting.  It was ok....not great and not awful.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|It seemed to me the first time through this album that it was a bit softer in  feel compared to their debut.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, just don't walk into this album expecting a sequel to Fallen.  Amy Lee's vocals are just as spectacular as ever, and with the music a bit more subdued, it just enhances the experience, if you will.  Ben Moody's absence is certainly felt, as this album is less guitar driven than the first. <br /> <br />I am writing this review as a comparison simply because I feel that this album is usually bought after the first (at least in conjunction with). <br /> <br />If you are looking for a stand-alone review, here it is.  This album is dark, granted, but Amy's voice is fantastic.  The whole album feels a bit dream-like (I understand that's a difficult description to quantify) but does have it's sharper points (i.e. Lose Control) which contrast nicely with the album's milder side.  The single \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" is still enjoyable, even after all the radio play it has received.  I suppose I could go and write a review for every song on here, but for the sake of brevity, I will just go out and say this album was amazing, but certainly different than the first. <br /> <br />It's hard to say whether a fan of the first will enjoy this as much (if not more), but I can say that if you appreciate good vocals and a well-painted lyrical landscape, I don't think you will be disappointed.
0618680004|5.0|I read the book, I liked it and I am an atheist. <br /> <br />In America everyone takes it for granted that you believe in a God.  Well I don't and I appreciate an eloquent voice like Dawkins giving a voice to people like me.   <br />
B0000028WD|5.0|The best tribute to the man and the music. The best guitar players in the world. Tom Petty is great, Johnny Winter show us how to play guitar on Highway 61 Revisited and Legends like Neil Young, Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Willie sings What Was It You Wanted. Would love to get the DVD of this. Cannot get it anywhere.

0142004235|5.0|East Of Eden is a remarkable novel surrounding family and love written by John Steinbeck. Despite its intimidating size and thickness, the book is actually quite enjoyable and entertaining. The book presents an astounding story filled with episodes of love, despair and family. Steinbeck molds the novel to resemble the different situations found in the Genesis of the Bible: the tale of Adam and Eve and the rivalry between Cain and Abel.  <br />In this novel, Steinbeck follows the traditional story of a tragic hero alongside his sidekick battling against the evil nemesis. Adam Trask, son of the former Cyrus Trask, finds himself passively living life and attempts to find a way to grasp the days as they progress by. He searches for an essence of life and finds Cathy, whose role is the apparent antagonist of the novel. As Adam is heartlessly abandoned with his twin sons Caleb and Aron, his Chinese servant Lee helps to provide for all of them until Adam, especially, can fully recover. Lee, in my opinion, serves as the essence that Adam has been looking for, the sidekick that heroes need. While Adam drowns in desolation, it is Lee who fosters the children and tends to everybody's needs. Though he has aspirations of his own, he consistently delays them in order to take care of the Trask family.  <br />Cathy is immediately labeled as the villain through Steinbeck's dramatic descriptions of her manipulative dark side. Yet Adam was completely oblivious to her deceit that he would have done anything to please her. She eventually abandons him, leaving him hopeless and miserable. This situation alludes to the Bible as Eve betrays Adam after she bites from the forbidden apple. Both women prove to be unfaithful and bring sorrow to their lover's lives.  <br />The confusing yet deep rivalry between Caleb and Aron are almost identical to that of the Bible between Cain and Abel. As one is seemingly treated with more recognition and admiration, the other becomes envious and  ultimatelyhomicidal. Though in this particular book, Caleb is not at fault for Aron's death, Caleb senses guilt from it and blames himself nonetheless. While in the Bible, Cain deliberately kills Abel as revenge for his mistreatment from God. Ultimately Cain is punished but Caleb also finds peace within himself to not put himself at blame.  <br />The immense effect as this captivating novel ties together is just incredible. Each story, each family, each relationship depicts those of real life, which also appeals to the readers. Steinbeck concludes the entire story with the term \\"Timshel\\" as a blessing from Adam to his son. Ending on such a melancholy yet perfected note simply enhances the overall effect the reader gets as the book is closed.
0743289412|5.0|The review by Nora Roberts, one of my favorite authors, brilliantly nails the essence of Lisey's Story, by another of my favorite authors.  In Lisey's Story, Stephen King offers a heartbreaking tale of love will haunt readers for a very long time.  It geve me a renewed appreciation for marriage and a deeper understanding of the dark things that lurk behind, and sometimes slip out from under, the edges of our \\"purple curtains.\\"  With prose so true and resonant, this book is really more a poem than a novel -- a poem about author Scott Landon's terrifying life and the wife that saved him.
0743289412|5.0|The people in Lisey's life are seldom charming, but they are real.  She comes to know and like most of them better as she learns to look behind the mental curtain she has hung over her own experience. <br /> <br />This story could only have been told through the culmination of all of Stephen Kings experience as a writer.  It wades into the mystical without getting boged in the muck, and addresses the ultimate questions: How can you have a relationship with anyone, or for that matter a life, if you don't know who you are; and how can you know who you are if you hide your life from yourself.  I was charmed, fascinated, and made just a bit more than a little uneasy. <br /> <br />
B000HEWEDK|5.0|For anyone who was a science fiction fan (and a kid) in 1956, this was the ticket. My father took me to see Forbidden Planet at a drive-in theatre. When the \\"Monster from the Id\\" materialized, I jumped behind the seat, but still managed to be captivated. 50 years later, the movie is no less riveting and entertaining. This anniversary DVD is a must-have for those who fondly recall the film from back then, and others who want to discover how this sci-fi classic helped inspire Star Trek, Star Wars and countless other film and TV titles. The bonus features tell the behind-the-scenes story with appropriate tributes to that lovable guy Robbie, the rest of the cast (Leslie Nielsen was so much older then), the pioneering electronic music, the \\"cutting edge\\" effects, and other details of the production process.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Steven Millhauser's brilliant little short story 'Eisenheim the Illusionist' is beautifully realized cinematically by Neil Burger who not only adapted the story as a screenplay but also directed with a great flair for the subject.  Wisely using the repeated line 'Nothing is what it seems' Burger infuses this dark investigation into the lives of the divided Viennese classes and suggests the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the focus on the illusory magic of one Eisenheim (finely characterized by Edward Norton) and its effects on the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and the bifurcated Duchess Sophie (Jessica Biel).<br /><br />As children  Eisenheim and Sophie were friends despite the disparity of their class: Sophie was royalty (a Duchess) and Eisenheim was the son of a cabinetmaker to the court.  They fall in love but are separated by caste and Eisenheim wanders Asia and Russia learning the vagaries of magic and illusionist tricks while Sophie is raised at court to become the wife of Crown Prince Leopold, whose plans to overthrow his father the Emperor to become the King of both Austria and Hungary have made him an obsessive scoundrel.<br /><br />Years later Eisenheim enters Vienna as a showman, under the tutelage of his impresario Josef Fischer (Eddie Marsan),  delighting audiences with his illusionist tricks.  His impossible love for Sophie resurfaces and he becomes suspect in his role as an illusionist and as a threat tot he Crown.  Eisenheim is investigated carefully by Chief Police Inspector Uhl (a brilliant role by Paul Giamatti) and the manner in which the fates of the Crown versus the love of Eisenheim and Sophie are resolved is, well, 'Nothing is what it seems'.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding, the setting (in Prague) is incredibly atmospheric, and the costuming and lighting and cinematography marry into a perfect fit.  Adding to the illusionist spirit of the film is the fine musical score by Phillip Glass so well loved for his score for 'The Hours' and one of our most important classical music composers of the day.  THE ILLUSIONIST is a fine, misty, dark evocation of life in La Belle &Eacute;poque of Vienna, based enough on fact that the fiction employs the concept that nothing is what it seems.

B000002IPZ|4.0|Testament has been my favorite metal band ever. Even though I loved Megadeth and Manowar too much at the time, I've always had a special love in Testament. It's mostly because of Alex Skolnick, who is one of Satriani's students, that created his own style and licks , without copying Satriani's. (Testament has never been the same after he left). and also Peterson, Clemente and Christian were monsters at their instruments, with Billy and his killing vocal, creating incredible music and lyrics. so why I gave 4 stars to this album?? There are masterpieces like \\"Souls of Black\\", \\"Legacy\\" and \\"Seven Days of May\\" in this album but, there are two or three songs that resembles each other. This album is worth to buy but not perfect as \\"the new order\\" and \\"practice what you preach\\"

The special features/scenes are nothing to be excited about.  <br /> <br /> <br />Other people who reviewed this product were being ridiculous when they were trying to put this movie down because Julia Roberts plays a hooker? It's called a movie role!  And after all, it all turns out for the best in the end. Whatever happened to just reviewing the actual product?

B000I0QL82|4.0|Viewing Holiday Inn is an annual Chirstmas time ritual in our household. This light hearted musical comedy features Bing Crosby at his best. Beyond the simple plot of friends compteting for the same gals, this movie is a wonderful reminder of lifestyle and music of the WWII generation. And did I mention the music - its big band meets the holidays. You'll find that music playing in your head for days.   <br />While it may seem odd that such an excellent movie is rarely shown on television I belive there is a simple explaination: Actors doing scenes in black face was OK in 1942, but would be controversial today. Be aware, dispite the colorful cover, this is a black and white edition, and the purists like it that way. <br />

B00007KWHN|5.0|When rock radio had to recognize that it had to let go of The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and all the other established rock icon's of the sixties, a new sound was being sought after since all the legends we suddenly gone.<br /><br />Yeah, many of us were ready to just get away from the \\"icon rock guitarist\\" and start to look for a sound that was much more adventurous and other-worldly.  Suddenly, we started to explore the sound of Progressive Rock.  It was a sound like it was trying to put Science Fiction to music.  Some of the most intelligent rock music was recognized as \\"progressive rock\\".  About 1970, Pink Floyd was venturing into experimental instrumental music and wasn't quite making much of an impact yet, but new bands like Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, and Yes were really challenging our tolerances of what an adventure or a fantasy could sound like when put to music.  I'd personally like to give credit to The Moody Blues for starting the humble beginnings of \\"progressive rock\\".  The Moody Blues were like \\"gods\\" during their day because nobody else sounded like them and they were taking us into the worlds of questionable mystique (and spiritual guidance).<br /><br />The first couple of albums from Yes sounded very experimental at best.  Several groups from Europe were doing this and many never really hit international stardom like The Moody Blues did.  But when Yes came out with this album \\"The Yes Album\\", this opened the door to unimaginable cerebral adventures and outer as well as inner space travel.  Nearly every track on this album became an FM rock staple, but what made this Prog album such a legend (and a few of the following albums from Yes) are that these albums became even more important as they got older.<br /><br />Even today's kids cannot deny that they're heard \\"I've Seen All Good People\\", \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\", and \\"Starship Trooper\\".  Whenever I turn on typical classic rock radio, any given moment, one of these tracks will come on.<br /><br />The early seventies had the most known classic albums from the progressive rock genre, but I'll bet they were growing stronger in appeal many years after they have been released.  Prog artists are the Immortal Gods of album rock.  You can't just buy a greatest hits album from prog rock bands.  Their albums are extremely important episodes of the overall big picture of what album rock was all about.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there probably aren't that many true \\"prog fossils\\" like myself anymore.  But, I'm happy to continue to be Proudly Unhipp and hang on to the Rock icons of the Prog genre.  I wouldn't doubt that my review here ever even gets read by anyone.  Nobody's even responded to my review on Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's first album that I reviewed many years ago, so I must truly be the only \\"prog dinosaur\\" left.  Nobody in California seems to care about 1970's Prog Rock.  I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan and I wonder if they even care about Prog rock anymore.  It's a lonely world still lovin' classic prog rock, but I will never give it up.  It is the most creative and adventurous music ever made.  Even to this day.moment, one of these tracks will come on. <br /> <br />The early seventies had the most known classic albums from the progressive rock genre, but I'll bet they were growing stronger in appeal many years after they have been released.

B00007KWHP|5.0|This was the considered strongest line-up of the (nearly) 40 year repertoire of the group Yes.<br /><br />The group Yes was experimental from the word \\"go\\", and this album is a reflection of each member wanting to give a direct isolated example of what they want to bring to the table to show off their art of instrumentation.<br /><br />Jon Anderson does most all the vocals.  His individual project on this album is his vocal chant on \\"We Have Heaven\\".<br /><br />Rick Wakeman's solo keyboard work is reflected with \\"Cans and Brahms\\"<br /><br />Percussionist Bill Bruford gives us \\"Five Percent For Nothing\\"  (I think it was even less than that).<br /><br />Chris Squire (bass guitarist) closes out \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" with a lilting guitar performance with \\"The Fish (Shindleria Praematurus)\\" with the help of Jon Anderson's chanting vocal and Bill Bruford's drumwork.<br /><br />And Steve Howe gives us a beautiful acoustic guitar solo with \\"Mood For a Day\\"<br /><br />The radio friendly hits on this album are \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"Long Distance Runaround\\".  Some of the more bolder classic rock stations may play \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" (which is one of the band's favorite tracks to play live).  But my absolute favorite on this album is \\"We Have Heaven\\" and \\"South Side of The Sky.\\"<br /><br />I'm not particularly crazy about every Yes album.  The most important three albums of theirs (to me), is \\"The Yes Album\\", \\"Fragile\\", and \\"Close To The Edge\\".<br /><br />All my life I've always had these three albums.  It really sucked having them on 8-track tape (and funny enough, they were my first purchases of these albums).<br /><br />After \\"Close To the Edge\\", Yes really started to get long-winded and pretentious for awhile.  Even Rick Wakeman agreed that \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" was a ridiculously complicated collage of \\"go nowhere\\" ideas that were segued together and was no way radio friendly at all.  You gotta be a die-hard Yes fan to truly appreciate and understand that double album.<br /><br />\\"Relayer\\" had its moments (\\"Sound Chaser\\" was decent), \\"Going For the One\\" was an album they all seemed to approve of, and \\"Tormato\\" also had only a few good tracks.  I've never owned \\"Drama\\" (the one album without Jon Anderson), but they still had yet to see their greatest selling album come to light.  Who ever thought that \\"90125\\" would be their greatest selling album ever?  This was a Yes album meant for radio.  \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" and \\"Leave It\\" charted very well as singles.  And even \\"It Can Happen\\" and \\"Changes\\" were often played on album rock radio.<br /><br />But, for me, the old Prog Fossil that I am, I'll always cherish their earlier three classic albums.  If you wanna know of a good DVD to get involving the long career of Yes, check out the DVD of \\"YesYears.\\"  It's got some excellent interviews and old film footage of the extensive career of the world of Yes.  It is the best known documentary of the group Yes.  Buy that one and maybe \\"The Moody Blues\\" documentary called \\"Legend of a Band.\\"  And if you need a good third Prog Rock documentary, get \\"Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's \\"Welcome Back\\" and/or \\"From the Beginning.\\"  Jump on these quick though, because I think that they are becoming harder to find.appreciate and understand that double album.   <br /> <br />\\"Relayer\\" had its moments (\\"Sound Chaser\\" was decent), \\"Going For the One\\" was an album they all seemed to approve of, and \\"Tormato\\" also had only a few good tracks.

The facts, I'm afraid, speak for themselves. We all know who the ney sayers work for. This film should be a MUST SEE for everyone. It also makes you very aware of how much the world changed when Bush won over Gore. You can't turn back the clock on Bush, but you can on Global Warming, but only if we act NOW!

As of late we have been very dissapointed with what the studios have had to offer. And then came the Illusionist............<br /><br /> If you want shooting, racing, sex, nudity, violence, etc. You won't like this movie. This film is perfectly put together with the perfect cast. The sepia tones throughout, and the areas where it was filmed give the movie a real classic feel.<br /><br /> Oh don't get me wrong, I like Dude Where's My Car, Pirates, Star Wars, The Godfather, Donnie Brasco, Pushing Tin, etc. But the Illusionist is special.<br /><br /> If your looking for a REALLY GOOD movie some night and the kids are in bed so you can concentrate on the film, watch The Illusionist. You will not be dissapointed.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have been under the impression ever since viewing my first scratchy copy of Metropolis that this was the movie in it's fullest, not true. In fact the movie was immediatly cut almost as soon as it was first shown and especially when it came to the United States. The basic story was the same but we lose so much as far as getting to know the characters better among various differnt subplots going on along with the main story.<br /><br />Unfortunatly for us all much of the original footage which was cut from the original screening is lost or beyond repair. However, a great deal of the scenes were in fact found, restored, and reintroduced into the flim for the first time since it's premiere in Berlin. Scenes which were either still missing or beyone repair were still used either by using stills or by text explaining the scene. Along with this beautifly restored picture we are given the orginal soundtrack used during it's premiere.<br /><br />The making of special feature was a welcomed suprise as we are told of the painstaking efforts by the crew in Germany to bring this most influential of all the German impressionist films. We also learn of the making of the original using brilliant moviemaking techiques such as animation and superimposing.<br /><br />By far, this is the version which comes the closest to the original version Fritz Lang had intended for us to see.
B000FUF6QS|5.0|This bizarre film is the original version of _The Wicker Man_, written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by British director Robin Hardy, first released in 1973.  This movie has recently been remade in a film by the same title with Nicolas Cage.  The original _The Wicker Man_ is widely regarded as a cult classic in the horror and thriller genre.  The movie is certainly one of the most bizarre and unique I have ever seen.  It is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious and stupid.  Apparently the movie is supposed to be some sort of musical, and throughout the movie the characters frequently break out into song.  Combined with the tacky 1970s style, this musical aspect of the movie comes across as utterly absurd and one cannot help laughing at it for how ridiculous it is.  Added to this is the fact that the music used is horrendously bad.  The movie unfortunately is filled with gratuitous nudity, including several dancing scenes with naked pagans dancing about in a Stonehenge like structure and a nude singing scene with Britt Ekland who plays the landlord's daughter, Willow.  Whenever these nude scenes occur, the main character (a devout Christian) becomes understandably uptight and agitated, and the absurd conflict that ensues comes across as utterly moronic.  Nevertheless, the excessive, gratuitous nudity detracts from an otherwise interesting film.  While the movie comes across as absurdly cheesey in this respect, it does try to have a message, only what exactly that message is, is difficult to tell.  Apparently, the movie is trying to make some statement about the conflict between Christianity and paganism.  The central Christian character is supposed to appear excessively self-righteous, uptight, and prudish.  He frequently refers to the inhabitants of the island as \\"godless heathens\\", questions their teacher as to why they are not learning about Christianity (when in fact they are being taught about phallic symbols of all things!), and complains of the debauchery and moral rot after seeing the nude dancing.  However, despite the obvious politically correct interpretation, I feel that his voice is the most common-sensical in the whole movie.  Obviously the rest of the island inhabitants see nothing wrong with nude dancing and ridiculously bursting out into song at every opportunity (let alone human sacrifice)!  The pagan in the movie by contrast is presented as absurdly atavistic and positively diabolical and evil (as will be seen later).  But, perhaps the really central issue in this film is that of human sacrifice.  The islanders have had a bad harvest so they need a human victim to sacrifice (a virgin, a man who comes of his own free will, etc.) to their gods so that they will have a good harvest the next year.  The victim has a \\"meeting with the wicker man\\" and will be burned alive.  Many primitive cultures did indeed engage in human sacrifices (for example, Caesar claimed that the druids were cannibals (whatever merit there is to this claim) and of course cultures like the Aztecs routinely sacrificed innocents).  Indeed, according to such anthropologists as James Frazer in his _The Golden Bough_, the killing of the king was the central element in many ancient cultures and beliefs.  I think that perhaps this theme is the one being presented in this movie in its dealing with human sacrifice.  But, I also suppose that the sacrificed Christian (who is also a virgin, annointed with oil, etc.) is supposed to be reminiscent of Christ himself (who was also sacrificed in a sense so that all men may have eternal life).  Indeed, the sacrificed Christian is to have a martyr's death, and he remains steadfast in his faith even as the flames consume him.  Interestingly, before he dies the Christian tells the chief pagan, Lord Summerisle (played by Christopher Lee) that should the sacrifice fail he will merely have to make another sacrifice the next year and that that sacrifice will be of Lord Summerisle himself.  Lord Summerislelooks merely baffled by all this and replies simply \\"The sacrifice will not fail!\\"  But, deep down the question remains, what will happen the following year.  Of course, to add to the absurdity of all this is the fact that as soon as the Christian is prepared to be sacrificed, the pagan villagers break out into another song and dance. <br /> <br />The basic plot of this movie involves a Christian policeman, police sergeant Howie (played by Edward Woodward), who visits Summerisle off the coast of Scotland, looking for the girl Rowan who is apparently missing.  There he encounters villagers who are seemingly reluctant to speak of such matters.  But, also he finds these villagers engaging in seemingly bizarre rituals and behaviors (including nude dancing and debaucheries) which he finds highly offensive.  It is only later that when he encounters Lord Summerisle himself that it is explained that the island inhabitants are in fact pagan.  Of course, a conflict ensues between the Christian beliefs of the policeman and the pagans.  Eventually, the policeman discovers that he has been deceived (after the inhabitants all dress up in bizarre costumes and parade around the island for a bit) and is to be sacrificed.  Such is the absurdity of this movie. <br /> <br />While the movie is certainly bizarre and uncanny, for the most part it comes off as ridiculously cheesey and preposterous.  Nevertheless, despite the cheesey stereotypes of Christians and pagans and the gratuitous nudity, this movie is probably worth watching simply for the fact that it is widely regarded as a cult classic, for its apparent bizarreness, and for the fact that it is totally unique and nothing really exists like it.  For the apparent strangeness if nothing else, you should watch this movie!       <br />
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This is what many, many fans have been waiting for. The DVD release of the Original Star Wars Trilogy that did not have the additions of the Special Edition release.

6305263248|2.0|\\"Ronin\\" sets out by telling the viewer about some Samurai warriors who were shamed when their lord was killed, via treachery, by another lord. This made them \\"Ronin\\" - or rogues. The movie itself bore scant resemblance to the legend it quoted -- which was only one of its shortcomings. Robert DeNiro phones in another performance, though Jean Reno did a creditable job as his ally Vincent.<br /><br />The film follows the formation of a mysterious, multi-national gang of criminals hired by a mysterious Irish woman to retrieve a mysterious silver case. The gang doesn't know what's in the case, who they are working for or about each other. There's lots of gunplay, plenty of car chases, faintly interesting locales on the French Riviera and Paris, and lots of collateral damage to civilians. What seems to propel the movie is the lack of clarity about the motives of the gang members and the purpose of their activities. Seemingly, this was intended by the writers, who wanted to show criminals (or are they?) furiously fighting and dying for a cause they did not understand, as long as a lucrative reward awaited them. For the viewer, however, the unfolding drama was the only reason to keep watching this dud of a film.<br /><br />For all its vaunted Samurai connections, Ronin was disappointing. The car chases were dull and seemed interminable. The accidents caused thereby were ludicrously overdramatic, with lots of flying sparks and gasoline explosions. The gunfights were ridiculously one-sided. By the end of the film, the silver case had changed hands so many times that the movie started to look like a comedy routine.<br /><br />\\"Ronin\\" is a standard shoot-em-up thriller that fails to deliver on its pretentious samurai metaphor. Hence, the 3 stars and a shrug-shouldered \\"eh.\\"
B000BP86OG|5.0|I love this album, but don't really know why.  The Darkness once again takes their Sweet meets Queen sound and comes up with an album of songs that simply will not leave your head.  The Queen comparisons are even stronger on this disc as long time Queen Producer Roy Thomas Baker does the production chores on the album.  Instrumentally these guys are nothing spectacular, but put all of the parts in the right places in order to come up with a winning formula.  The band never takes itself too seriously and some of the songs, such as \\"Knockers\\" and \\"Bald\\" are hilarious.  The title track rocks with a song about cocaine (band leader Justin Hawkins recently entered rehab for his problem with it.  \\"English Country Garden\\", \\"Hazel Eyes\\", \\"Blind Man\\" \\"Is It Just Me\\", \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\\" are all solid rock songs.  Justin Hawkins uses his upper register falsetto more on this album than on the first, and your mileage will vary as to whether you find it annoying or enduring.  Overall I really enjoy this disc, and it is a great one to crank up in your car.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I watched this movie last night with my family.  We found the film very entertaining and a bit informative.  I'm not a scientist so I can't speak of its scientific merit.  It's also obvious that the film makers have a political point to make.  But regardless of its scientific accuracy or political agenda what if the point that greenhouse gases are changing the climate is correct? <br /> <br />I may not know the correct procedures on how to prove scientifically that the presicent Bush neglects the environment.  However, does this mean it isn't true?  Common sense says look at previous behavior.  Just because I can't prove how the internet works doesn't mean that it doesn't.  Common sense says it does.  So anyone who sits and waits for proof before taking action is someone who chooses to sit in denial.  I think that the comparison the film makes to the tobacco companies and their denail of the link between smoking and cancer is something to consider.  Why did we have to wait for concrete, undenialbe proof while so many people died from their tobacco addiction? <br /> <br />Balance isn't the point of this film.  It's not necessary to hear opposing views to everything that happens in our lives.  Imagine calling 911 and the operator ask to hear an opposing view before responding to an emergency.  Imagine an EMS call...This is 911 what's is the nature of the emergency...My husband is trying to kill me...Well let me hear his side of the story before we send the police... <br /> <br />Evidence does show that the Earth is getting warmer.  That in itself is scary.  Whether or not it's global warming, increased sun activity, or whatever else may be in the mix, the film shows that it's something that we all should take seriously and do all that we can to minimize or reverse the process.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is the best game we have purchased in a Loooong time!  It has won many awards and so on, but I love the fact that we can all play as a family, and it can be as easy or difficult as you want it to be.  My 6 yr old is very strategic and really plays this well- thinking through his moves. But in comparison my 5 year old has no real rhyme or reason as to how she plays her pieces, and she still seems to enjoy playing and actually does very well without really trying. We are actually considering getting the Blokus game that is done on the hexagon shaped board just to change things up a bit.  I imagine that we will have this game forever, as it can change with the ability level of the players. <br /> <br />The board is sturdy as well as the plastic misc. shapes, so the game as well as the construction is great. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this game!   This game would be a great gift too!!!   :)

0385495323|3.0|I thought the subject matter might be intriguing, and was extremely impressed with the 5-star average rating given by Amazon readers.  The information presented certainly IS interesting, but I found the writing to be tedious and repetitive at times, which compells me to deduct stars.  If you want your non-fiction to read like a novel, I'd choose something different.  If you don't mind a bit of \\"textiness,\\" I would recommend it.  I certainly learned something new, which always worth a star!

B00005JNS0|5.0|I went to the theatre and watched it with my family. We pruchased the DVD, and we watched it twice already, and the special features are very nice. And I have to say this is a children's movie, but those people made this movie for adults (NascarFans) to appreciate. The racing. The talking. The little details here and there are much more appriciated by us adults than the children. From the Tatoo on the car's behind to the little Bug cars. They just amazed me. Don't miss it.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Poor excuse for a film.  Not at all a horror film, an exploitation film if anything.  I have no idea how this piece of garbage made its way into the theaters.  Waste of time!  Little gore, stupid story, bad acting, and tons of cheap sex scenes.  Ridiculous!  I would have given no stars if possible.
0142000655|5.0|This riveting novel is a must read for anyone, let alone a Steinbeck afficionado.  The many twists and turns in the intertwining plot(s) of this novel require much attentiveness to track and piece together.  Reading this novel is an adventure in itself, as Steinbeck lays out the pieces of the plot of his novel thoughtfully and carefully reveals them one at a time to create a linking time puzzle that only gets more compelling as the pages go by. <br /> <br />Steinbeck's diction is strong and although the plot is slow to unravel, the book picks up speed after the first segment that lays the foundation for the rest of the novel.  Every page nonetheless offers something interesting and captures both your attention and your wit.  This is a novel that you would definitely call \\"smart,\\" as it takes pondering to finally piece together the final meaning of the book. <br /> <br />Without a doubt, this novel will leave you thinking, \\"Wow, I would of never thought of it ending like that.\\"  For any reader who appreciates fine writing, this book is highly recommended.

0684824906|4.0|Of all the American Presidents, I admire Abraham Lincoln the most because he stalwartly endured so much: rebellious states, incompetent Federal generals, a fractious Republican Party, near-treasonous Democrats, a financially irresponsible and mentally unstable wife, and the death of a son. Finishing this thick work, my esteem for him is in no way diminished.<br /><br />TEAM OF RIVALS by Doris Kearns Goodwin is, above all, a political biography of Lincoln as he rose through the ranks from country lawyer to Illinois state legislator to U.S. Congressman to presidential candidate to Chief Executive. As the Republican nominee for President in 1860, he beat out several formidable rivals for the nomination, including Salmon Chase, William Seward, and Edward Bates. Once elected, Lincoln was wily enough to keep his former (and potentially future) adversaries within immediate sight by cajoling them into his Cabinet - Chase at Treasury, Seward at State, and Bates as Attorney General. Thus, TEAM OF RIVALS is necessarily a political biography of each of these three men and, to a lesser degree, also one for each of the other prominent members of the Cabinet -  Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General, Edwin Stanton as War Secretary (succeeding Simon Cameron), and Gideon Wells as Navy Secretary. The remarkable teamwork the Cabinet displayed to steer the Union through the darkest days of the Civil War is its, and Lincoln's, great achievement.<br /><br />In her memoir of growing up, WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR, Goodwin is charmingly engaging. At 754 pages with two extensive photographic sections, TEAM OF RIVALS is hardly that but erudite, detailed, and lucid. The author's treatment of her subject is obviously admiring. At no point does Goodwin's narrative slime Abe's reputation with any perception which one normally ascribes to the currently incumbent band of dubious, self-serving, vacillating, and morally compromised public parasites whatever their party affiliation. Perhaps Lincoln was truly a wise and steadfastly principled man, or Goodwin just chose not to notice any blemishes. Or perhaps time itself serves as an airbrush.<br /><br />It took me almost four months to gnaw my way through this lengthy volume; it's not a book I couldn't put down. For that reason, I'm knocking off a star, though I freely admit that this is more a deficiency related to my attention span than anything else. Others, not wearied by too much of a good thing, will justifiably award 5 stars.truly a wise and steadfastly principled man, or Goodwin just chose not to notice any blemishes.

B000K9L32U|5.0|It takes a couple of repeated listens, but once the songs grow on you the album really pays dividends.  Those fans expecting the same bubble gum disco numbers will come away disappointed.  Take That is a band clearly affected by the 10 years they've been apart.  They're grown men well into their 30's and have gone through a lot since their last album.  Those changes are well reflected in the songs you hear.  There's been a lot of criticism about the direction of the band.  I think that direction has been made pretty clear on the album.  They realize that they've had their heyday and they're not out to get a whole bunch of new fans.  They're not aiming for teens anymore because it would a ridiculous career move for them.  So many boy bands think they can just keep cranking out the same pop tunes and keep attracting young fans.  Take That is smart in at least attempting to avoid that pitfall.  Beautiful World may not give Take That the chartbusting success they had in the 90's, but I think the lads are content with just putting out a solid album.  Robbie Williams cheekiness would've been brought a welcome variety to the album, but they're still talented enough without him.

B00005JNJV|5.0|As a fan of the Batman character, one of the strong points of the Batman persona is how realistic it is, or at least how realistic it could be. I once read a quote stating that, 'Superman is the American dream, Batman is the American reality.' How true. There is nothing fantasy-related like Spiderman, Superman, etc. in this film. Bruce Wayne and the characters he encounters exist in the world we live in; thus, Batman exists as though he were real. For those who aren't aware, Batman is not a \\"super\\" hero in the true sense of \\"super heroes\\" because he is simply a man, or as director Christopher Nolan aptly put it, \\"He makes himself extraordinary through force of will.\\" Batman Begins is not only the best Batman film ever made, but as a longtime fan of the comic books, I am convinced it is the greatest Batman story ever told.     One of the great elements of this film is its great character arc. Whereas in the previous 4 Batman films, Alfred was more a minor point in the story: an old man in a tuxedo who served as Bruce Wayne's butler, in Batman Begins, the Alfred character is given much more depth as not only the connection between Thomas Wayne and his son, Bruce, but also a friend and a father figure. Likewise with Commissioner Gordon. In the previous films, he has spoken but a few lines and we are not given any background into his character (for that matter, the previous four films did not give much background into Bruce Wayne/Batman's character, either). Here, we see James Gordon prior to being a police commissioner and we understand his motivations as the one good cop in a deteriorating city. Also, the love interest in Batman Begins, unlike the previous four films, is no damsel in distress. She is an assistant district attorney and a childhood friend of Bruce's who is more than capable of taking care of herself. Every character in Batman Begins has a purpose- it is really very well written.     Most importantly, we see a very realistic and plausable explanation onthe formation of the Batman persona: motivations, mistakes, and challenges ahead. Whereas Batman served as somewhat of a talk-show host in the previous 4 films, inviting more celebrated villains to take center-stage, Batman Begins is a film about the tragedy, loss, and re-invention of Bruce Wayne and his one man war on crime.      This film is truly a modern-day classic. It is dark, psychological, haunting, beautiful, well-written, well-thoughtout, and well-acted. I have heard people complain about the action sequences with Batman being shot too tight, but there is an explanation for this as well. In the comics, Batman is somewhat of an urban legend- not many people have seen him, though those that have said his speed in combat was blindingly fast. Therefore, Christopher Nolan shot his action scenes as though those who encounter the Batman don't know what hit them.     Upon watching Batman Begins, one can see that the four previous Batman films (they got progressively worse in my opinion, though the first 3 can be described as good)not only have not aged well, but really missed the forest for the trees in terms of story-telling. They spent too much time developing over-the-top villains and their backgrounds while failing to develop Batman or Bruce Wayne as a character. They also failed to stay true to the comics in a number of instances: in the first Batman, the Joker was killed off in the end. In the second Batman, the Penguin was made to be a gross, black-spewing monster. In the third and fourth films, Batman had nipples on the Batsuit.      The \\"new\\" Batman franchise, directed by Christopher Nolan, will be a trilogy, with the next film, The Dark Knight, to be released in July 2008. It will include Heath Ledger as the Joker in what will prove to be a very different (read: not funny like Jack Nicholson's portrayal) depiction of the character. If the Dark Knight is even in the ballpark of Batman Begins, we're in for another treat.

I'd rather not see him run in 2008 as I don't wish upon him the job of cleaning up Bush's messes, as whoever succeeds him, Democrat or Republican, is going to have a tough and not often happy job facing them.  Given his age, he has plenty of time to make the move towards the Presidency if he wants.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an excellent film of the utmost importance to every single one of us. Once you've seen it you cannot possibly ignore the threat to our planet. Al Gore is utterly convincing, inspiring, even. We humans may be be on the verge of self-destruction but thank goodness there are still people like the AIT team to show us how to avoid it. Tell all your friends about it.
B000LC55F2|1.0|This movie starts out well but quickly falls apart due to the addition of a certain \\"magical technique\\" and the very heavy revenge driven plot line. The movie is all about revenge for the death of a character we only saw for a few minutes. Any normal person would have simply walked away but these two go after each other for years and we all know how that ends. The plot twist was nice but easy to figure out so this movie ended up being dull, and stupid.

B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Have you been starving for some old-fashioned rock like the sort that hogged FM radio in the early to mid-seventies? Do your eyes brim with tears when you pull out a dusty plastic 12-inch black slab of \\"Machine Head\\" or \\"Demons and Wizards?\\" Do you still sit around and pine for a Black Sabbath reunion? Lo, my brethren. Salvation has arrived and they call themselves Wolfmother.<br /><br />This debut CD sounds like it dropped from a time machine. \\"Wolfmother\\" is chock full of rocking seventies organ slamming minor chords atop big threatening sounding guitars as a singer wails above it like he has a cassette of Led Zeppelin wedged in his larynx. Does \\"Dimension\\" echo Black Sabbath? Heck, yeah. How about a little Deep Purple buried in \\"Joker and The Thief?\\" Oh, Baby. Zep lightning striking through \\"Woman?\\" I gotta whole lotta love for you, brother. And just to prove they aren't completely retro, \\"Apple Tree\\" sounds like it came from the White Stripes' bag of leftovers.<br /><br />Easily the best hard rock debut album to come out so far this century, Wolfmother proves you don't have to be original to be great. I am hoping that they can keep evolving as a band; the last thing we need is the second coming of Kingdom Come. But for now, \\"Wolfmother\\" has a secure slot in my CD machine.

0307237699|5.0|Like many others, I knew nothing of Barack Obama's politics until he stunned me with his keynote speech at the 2004 Democrat Convention in Boston. As I watched his deliverance, I asked myself: Why isn't he running for president? Now, after reading his book, I think he is certainly qualified!<br /><br /> Obama's speech was just a taste of what he has to say.<br /><br />Obama took his title \\"Audacity of Hope\\" from words delivered by his pastor Rev. Jeremiah A, Wright Jr. in a church sermon and ended with \\"My heart is filled with love for this county.\\" This statement comes through loud and true in the 362 pages within chapters titled Republicans and Democrats, Values, Our Constitution, Politics, Opportunity, Faith, Race, The World Beyond Our Borders, Family and in the Epilogue. Within these pages Obama talks about difficult topics, presenting his views and the laws regarding touchy subject like abortion, health care and poverty. He writes about the government now, previous presidents and their gifts to the U.S. He points out positives and negatives in various administrations.<br /><br /> About his opposing the war in Iraq, Obama writes that in 2002: \\"I made a speech at one of the first antiwar rallies in Chicago in which I questioned the Administration's evidence of weapons of mass destruction and suggested that an invasion of Iraq would prove to be a costly error.\\"<br /><br /> Obama's book aquatints readers with his family: wife Michelle and his daughters Malia and Sasha and how he strives to spend as much time with them as possible during his busy life as a U.S. Senator from Illinois.<br /><br />  The book also contains humor. We get a good look at Michelle talking with Obama on the telephone when he has briefed her on happenings in the Senate -- she changes the topics by telling him they have ants upstairs and he needs to stop on his way home to pick up ant traps. Also, she refuses to allow Obama to shop for birthday \\"goody bags\\" because she informs he wouldn't be able to handle it.<br /><br /> A colorful picture is painted also of Obama's mother, the father he barely knew, and his lifestyle being born in Hawaii and as a small child moving to Indonesia and then returning to the U.S., his collage and law school years, working with the poor in Chicago, going into politics, and his visions for the future.<br /><br /> Sometimes the sentences can be a bit long and rather academic, but in all the book is a rewarding read with visions of hopes of prosperity for the future.le it.  <br /> A colorful picture is painted also of Obama's mother, the father he barely knew, and his lifestyle being born in Hawaii and as a small child moving to Indonesia and then returning to the U.S., his collage and law school years, working with the poor in Chicago, going into politics, and his visions for the future. <br /> Sometimes the sentences can be a bit long and rather academic, but in all the book is a rewarding read with visions of hopes of prosperity for the future. <br />
B000IONJH4|5.0|Looked jaw droppingly good when compared to some of the older DVD Transfers. This is one of my all time favourites with amazing production value, set design and storyline (ok, so some of the effects look a bit dodgy when compared with today's photorealistic CGI and effects). So happy that David Lynch turned down Star Wars and stuck with his guns to do this. Just a shame that it got swept away by the Star Wars limelight as it's almost criminal that the rest of the books weren't made into film...

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Sometimes the greatest thing about a movie is the `feel' it has.  The cinematography, score and sets all working together to portray and pull you in to this world.  This comes together flawlessly in The Illusionist.  It is probably the greatest appeal and what keeps peoples eyes glued to the screen.  The acting is also superb.  Paul Giamatti is at his top form as Chief Inspector Uhl.  It is the best work Jessica Biel has ever done.  Edward Norton may seem dry at times but this is in perfect character for the part he plays.  Eisenheim's entire life is about magic and love and Edward Norton nails this part perfectly.  Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold plays the perfect villain for this time period.<br /><br />Eisenheim is a famous illusionist.  His illusions were so realistic that people truly believed they were real, and he had a faithful following.  As a child he had a friendship with Duchess Sophie (Biel) whom he loved.  They are kept apart due to social classes.  Eisenheim is just the son of a cabinet maker.  They meet again later in life but Sophie is engaged to be married to Crown Prince Leopold, not out of love, but obligation.  This is where the story ensues.<br /><br />This is a movie about magic and love.  It is not one that you want to have a lot of plot spoilers before you watch it.  The joy is in observing the twists and turns, even if they are easy to figure out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000002UAU|1.0|DISAPOINTING.  SANDY FARINA'S SONG WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CD.  IF I KNEW THIS, I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHESE THE CD.
B00004BZ16|3.0|I bought this album based on George Starostin's recommendation - he holds this up as the Clash's best album (and I respect his opinion greatly). Can't really agree, though, and I don't think many people do. There is definitely a lot of high quality work here, but for me it is a bit of a disappointment after London Calling.  Probably a third of these songs are darn good.  I wouldn't say anything on here has a wow factor, though.  After a few listens, I'm not excited to share any of the highlights with my friends or family.  It's worth buying, though, if you liked London Calling and if the price is right.   I just wish someone with discerning tastes would have whittled this down to about half the length.  No way I could ever make it through either CD without skipping a couple of songs.  I understand (per George) the Clash rejected the royalties from this album in order to keep the price down.  My take on this is they must have felt guilty for all the filler.  Another thing to note: it's evident listening to this how much disco/dance music had permeated society by this time.  Disco was definitely fading by now, but Michael Jackson, Sister Sledge and Kool and the Gang were big enough that you could hardly avoid having that type of music as part of the soundtrack for your life.  The Clash couldn't help but be influenced and it shows on several tracks which have a slick dance rhythm.  You won't find the variety of genres here as you did on Londong Calling. You have some reggae and some proto-new wave dance fusion with a punk singing style. All in all, it's a very good (not great) CD's worth of material on a two CD set.
B000I0QK74|2.0|Not a typical Xmas CD.  Prefer the non-traditional song \\"River\\" to anything on the disc.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I listened to this album the first time back in the early 80's.  This was in the days before CD's.  I liked a handful of songs; Train in Vain and Wrong `Em Boyo come to mind, but I found the rest of it to range from only okay to downright annoying.  The reason?  Back then, this type of singing was really \\"punk\\" and was only done by a handful of bands.  It just didn't sit well with me that the guy (Joe Strummer) couldn't sing on key.  Much of it was more like he was kind of yelling and not singing at all.  Fast forward to last month.  I gave it another listen and just couldn't believe I ever thought this was anything other than great, catchy, instantly accessible music.  That just shows you how influential this band was - dozens of followers have had massive airplay and I've grown accustomed to this style of singing, so much that it seems pretty much mainstream.  <br />As for the songs; the aforementioned two are still my favorites, but the rest really holds up, too.  Ultimately there are 4 or 5 songs that are just okay - The Right Profile goes on a little too long and it's hard to find a hook.  Revolution Rock definitely goes a couple minutes too long and gets messy.  I wouldn't say there are any songs I would skip, though, which is pretty high praise for double album.  Don't go in thinking this is a punk rock record, though.  This isn't a gritty call for anarchy - it's catchy and fun rock - more like power pop.  On this album, the Clash touch on several genres of music and, as another reviewer said, make them all their own.  If you ever thought you might be a Clash fan, just buy it.  This album would also appeal to most fans of power pop.  <br />

To do so she enlists the help of Margaret Lea, the daughter of a used/antique bookstore owner to write her biography.  Margaret Lea, goes to Vida Winter's house to begin her \\"research\\" and is plunged into a story of love, betrayal, deceit & isolation - a story that she cannot pull herself away from.<br /><br />Setterfield does an amazing job portraying the characters in this book as well as the place.  You feel like you are a bystander watching this story unfold - as if you are there in the book with the characters.  And they will haunt you for days after you finish the book.  It is a great fun read!
B0002I831S|5.0|This is a great sets to have if you love  \\"STAR TREK\\" and the price on amazon can't be beat

B000JJS8TM|5.0|Amazing how old songs can sound so new and fresh..... <br />Could not stop listening to it for the first two weeks I had the CD. <br />The Beatles truly were the greatest band in the world....
630542845X|4.0|good movie that didn't get much recognition. Great line; \\" I didn't think anyone was too white for u\\"
0740748475|5.0|The books are absolutely beautiful--my husband loves them!  I would recommend this as a gift for anyone with a loved one who is a fan of the Calvin and Hobbs.  This is probably the most beautifully done \\"complete works\\" that I have ever seen.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|this CD needs a few listening-to's. it's a mess and i couldn't find any reason to relate it particularly to the \\"Love\\" theme title except that it's been released just in time to catch up with the christmas sales, thus a money making product rather than an attempt at musical genius. Sir George Martin trying hard to teach his son how to try and mix-up another Sgt. Pepper. But Sgt. Pepper was an original. all the tracks on this album have been released before and the \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"-version which we by now know from the Anthology series is definitely out-of-place within the sequence that it has been screwed up here. <br /> <br />why i give it 4 stars? well, first i was only give it 2 or 3, but i don't like to write reviews for items which i'd \\"lowstar\\", and i liked it more, as i said at the beginning when i listend to it a few more times. <br /> <br />what i'd like to be looking forward to rather are the LP compilations which NEVER yet made it onto CD, which are the Albums \\"The Beatles Rock'n'Roll\\", \\"The Beatles Love Songs\\" and the Live Album \\"The Beatles Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\". there has also been another record in those days which has not been released as such a compilation \\"The Beatles Collection\\". <br /> <br />talk to me again after those. <br /> <br />JohPWilbrand
0307346609|5.0|Most people interested in this book will remember Brooks's previous book, The Zombie Survival Guide that was such a hit. Here Brooks describes the worldwide zombie war that engulfed all of humanity, bringing us to the brink of destruction. In his engrossing style of dead seriousness about a silly subject that makes you believe it almost happened, the reader's attention is kept to the last page. Highly recommended for anyone interested in pop culture, zombies, or horror in general.
B000J103N4|5.0|i put this album on my wishlist while in the meantime i still have the audio cd released years ago. i used to have the record as well years back in another country - another world. and that is what this record is. it's simply the best i know of David Crosby and his harmonies are always stunning to me, they are so ... don't find a word to describe it. i like the long song 'Cowboy Movie' particularly and sometimes i feel i can trace a bit of it in Bob Dylan's 'Brownsville Girl / New Danville Girl'-Recording. <br /> <br />this is an album i'll NEVER grow tired of listening to. nevermind what music genre you collect: this one's a must have. <br /> <br />JohPWilbrand

B00005NKK8|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS ALBUM!  IT HAS TO BE ON MY TOP 5 FAV ALBUM LIST.  BUT FORREST GUMP IS HANDS DOWN MY FAV MOVIE.  THE 2-CD SET IS FULL OF AWESOME CLASSIC ROCK AND ROCK TUNES...NOT A BAD ONE IN THE BUNCH.  EVEN IF YOU LOVE 1/3 OF THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE, BUY THIS 2-CD SET.  YOU WILL BE PLEASED!
0803729227|5.0|A really beautiful book;the illustrations and the plot make this book work. The rhyme scheme keeps children interested.
B000002JPA|5.0|Often when one goes digging back into a band's catalogue what is found are recordings that only show their immaturity and lack of experience.  Rarely do you find a gem like this one.  I didn't really care for \\"Awake\\" and expected the same with this one but not so.  This is well-crafted and expertly performed progressive rock album from beginning to end.  Every song is a surprise and a joy to listen to.  I only wish I would have known about these guys 15 years ago.  Better late than never, though!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is a great movie. I love everything adout it. Especially the dancing.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|The acting was top-notch & the characters were well-cast.  The story was a little scatered, but the aptly placed lines held it all together.  NOT for kids, at least not at my house - but fun for late-night adult-oid \\"I'm so tired of thinking\\" viewing.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was kind of sceptical to hear how Evanescence's songwriting would sound without Ben Moody.  Terry Balsamo proved to be just as great as a collaborator for Amy Lee.  This CD is definitely impressive!
1559408855|5.0|Some people are saying that this film has a message, they are correct, it says \\" I want to disturb you.\\" The two mentions of political and social beliefs are there for fluff. She wolf of the ss had more social commentary. that being said, it was worth the money i paid just to laugh at a friend as I skipped 1/3 of the movie (the circle of merde part,) because he was about to vomit. Dont expect a gripping story against marxism, but prepare your self to say what the \\"f@@k\\" and laugh at the way over the top characters.
B00005JLEU|4.0|HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is our favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie but this one is our 2nd favorite & it's quiet fantastic too.
B000255LIY|4.0|Good movie, same lines as the original with Peter O'tool, supporting cast was rather weak. Richard was badly cast, as was the young King of France. The poor armor was really fake looking. But overall, the lead characters of Henry and Eleanor made the movie worth watching.
0618477977|4.0|My son asked Santa for it and he was really happy when he got it. He loves it. I only gave it 4 stars because the bell was real cheap. It's a wonderful story for the whole family to enjoy.
B000HT3Q3M|4.0|I love this CD.  I am a huge George Benson fan as well as Al Jarreau. What a wonderful collaboration .  I was am not a great fan of the song with Paul McCartney.  I loved the duets with Jill Scott and Patti Austin.  It is a must have to a collection of any fan of George or Al.
B0009X766Y|5.0|One of the best movies of the 70's.It's wonderful.We enjoyed seeing again.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This series is an excellent overview of the highlights of the early days of our space program, with the focus on the Apollo program. The drama, the special effects and the details on the unsung heroes of NASA make this a terrific series. I was impressed particularly regarding the episodes on Apollo 1, and the development of the Lunar Module. The students in my space science class enjoy this throughly.
B000JLTRJ0|3.0|I was not very happy with this DVD. I thought it would deal with more of the real time events. It only mainly dealt with Port Authority officals.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everybody should see this movie. Strong document showing where the world is going...! Less pictures and images then I had expected. Lot of talking, figures, charts,... <br />Impressing to see how Gore found a new goal in his life after loosing the elections. It is thanks to him that global warming is surfacing and starts to get the attention that it needs.
B000B8QF00|5.0|\\"The Collection\\" is an 18 song best of from Alanis Morissette, hand picked herself, and featuring the hand doing the picking on the cover. I've been more of a casual fan, keeping an ear out for her new singles and such on the radio, but after hearing this, I'm finding her studio records rather collectible. It has all her biggest singles, running through all sorts of emotions, has some thoughtful lyrics, plus some really special rarities.    Theres:    5 tracks from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" (1995)  2 tracks from \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" (1998)  1 track from \\"MTV Unplugged\\" (1999)  1 track from \\"Under Rug Swept\\" (2002)  2 tracks from \\"Feast on Scraps\\" (2002)  2 tracks from \\"So Called Chaos\\" (2004)    There's also a track called \\"Mercy\\" from an album called \\"The Prayer Cycle\\", where Alanis sings in Hungarian, \\"Still\\" from the \\"Dogma\\" soundtrack, \\"Uninvited\\" from the \\"City of Angels\\" soundtrack (which got a bit of airplay, at least here in Australia back in the day), and a cover of \\"Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)\\" from the \\"De-Lovely\\" soundtrack, which are all nice to have. There's also her 2005 single, \\"Crazy\\", a cover of the Seal song. It's got great production, with catchy beat and a colourful little synth in place of the echoey bursts of the original.    The booklet includes full lyrics, credits, and a foreword by Alanis Morissette explaining why she chose the songs she did. There's also a collage of photos across the bottom of the credits, which was interesting.    Worth a look for casual fans, I think.
B000056HE9|5.0|The cast is perfect in this movie.  Cary Grant as the angel, perfect. David Niven as the stuffy bishop, perfect and Loretta Young as the beautiful and ignored bishop's wife, perfect.  The supporting cast is, perfect.  The story is inspired and the direction is perfect.  O.K. maybe one little flaw - the ice skating scene is a bit overdone and silly, but what the heck it's just a movie.  A must have for anyone who wants a good holiday movie no matter what age.
B000JJRIN4|1.0|Either Gwen has started to believe her own hype or she surrounded herself with the wrong people.  THis CD is a horrible mess;  while i appreciate pop artists that try to be hip and stylish, gwen just doesnt pull it off; her aspirations dont match her talent.  -And Gwen is now giving off a stanky self important diva vibe that kills her charisma.  too bad, her last CD seemed to be a step in a good direction.

B000JJRIO8|1.0|Tupac was once a modern-day folk hero, and over the years, his smother has turned him into a laughing stock. Tupac's legacy has gone from class to trash. Congrat's Afeni and Co., you've tarnished a man's life-long work in the name of the almighty dollar. What you people have done is the equivalent of taking a van gogh painting, deficating all over it, and then saying that's the way vincent would have wanted it. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.
B000002MZ9|5.0|Mirror Ball is my favorite Neil Young album.  Every song on this album is a winner.  You just can't beat the sound of Old Black and the Fender Deluxe and this is the overwhelming sound on this CD.  Lots of great guitar solos, great beat, great backing by Pearl Jam.  I'm the Ocean certainly seems to be an autobiographical number.  If you like Rockin in the Free World, you will love this whole CD.
B0009A40ES|5.0|American Psycho is a compendium of serial killers staring Christian Bale. I believe it's his best work and he's amazing at pulling off a decent into madness in a narcissistic corporate world. This slash and chop movie is so classy that it is levels above the other slasher genre. Bale is known mostly for his Batman role but his acting in this movie blew me away. If you like murder in an Armani suit there is no better then this one.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is an excellent item.  I am still trying to watch the entire thing from show to show in order.
B000FGGE68|3.0|We bought this movie because of mila jovanavich. However we would have been better off renting it. It didn't seem to have much of a plot. A lot of action yes, plot not so much. So if you are into action with out much of a plot this is definitely the movie for you. I guess the downer about it was it seemed to start in the middle and we spent most of the movie trying to figure out what was going on.
0446528056|5.0|I own every Nicholas Sparks book and Dear John is definitely my favorite.  Because of his fantastic ability to capture every detail, I felt as if I knew each character personally.  This was a story of true, unconditional love. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read!  However, I must warn you - it's a tear jerker so keep some tissues handy.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I love this movie. Its a timeless one that doesn't get old. you can watch it over and over. If you are thinking about adding it to your movie collection do so! You wont regret it.
B000BB1MHS|4.0|A remake of an old classic. It has redeeming parts through out and Depp's performance is well done. If you are looking it to follow the old movie - it does not. It you are looking for the connection to the book, there is very little. Enjoy the movie for itself.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins book is stunningly honest and forthright in its evaluation and examination of organized religion. He is able to see beyond the hollow arguments and flawed logic of religiosity and bring an enlightened (even if it is harsh) perspective to the many deeds and misdeeds of religion.  By doing so, he has given a voice to the many silent atheists in the world and perhaps has caused some agnostics to get off the fence and join the enlightened side.  Dawkins critique is particularly important in this newest era of evangelism, which is allied with the likes of George W. Bush, among others.  Their growing political and social influence, and anti-American ideas (such as theocracy) must be met with truth and vigilance.  Dawkins takes us in that direction quite effectively.  This is a \\"must read\\" if you are in the least bit concerned about the eroding legacy of our Founding Fathers (a legacy built upon secularism, freedom of speech and the press etc.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son recommended this series when I complained that there wasn't much I liked on TV.  I've always liked sci-fi, but Firefly is exceptionally impressive. It's great to watch a series where the writing is as good as the action.  I loved the dialogue! Joss Whedon created a universe like no other, and it's his unique vision that makes the series so fascinating. The character development and humor are so much better than most TV series, and it was just getting started!  I guess this explains why there's not much on TV I like: the intelligent stuff with substance often gets canned by not-so-intelligent network execs.  Big mistake, FOX.
0618154248|5.0|Got this set as a Christmas gift for our 2.5 yr old granddaughter.  She LOVES her books but is very hard on them as a result. Recently had a post- Christmas visit and the books are in great shape despite having been dragged all over the place for the past 4 weeks.  They are read every day and a big part of the ritual is putting them back in their carrying case. Definitely a big hit!

B000056HE9|5.0|I bought this DVD for my sister, a fan of the movie. She made me watch it with her on Christmas. The touching topic, the much-missed actors starring in the movie and the easy pace of the story left us feeling content, refreshed and ready for more pumpkin pie.

B00000DGSN|5.0|THE BAND: Ritchie Blackmore (guitars), Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1973) Originally 7 songs clocking in at 77 minutes; 2 vinyl album presented on one disc. This digitally remastered \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition (1998) contains a 2nd disc with 3 bonus songs, \\"Black Night\\", \\"Speed King\\" and a 50's cover \\"Lucille\\". Disc-2 clocks in at approximately 21 minutes. Included with the discs is a 14-page booklet with original artwork and bonus color band photos, song titles, song times, and a brief 3-page intro. Songs recorded live in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. There is also a (most complete) rare 3-disc version availabe as well. Originally on Warner Bros label, this remastered edition is on Rhino.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Made In Japan\\" is perhaps one of the best live recordings of a hard rock / heavy metal act ever. Think of the other classic acts that had great live albums from the past... Peter Frampton, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Foghat, UFO, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc. \\"Made In Japan\\" offers the complete package - excellent sound quality/production, emotion, energy, excitement, audience participation, and a great selection of songs. The audience was respectfully quiet during the songs and really let it out in between them. Incredibly, no added audience filler noise! The slower parts of \\"Child In Time\\" - you can hear a pin drop. It's interesting to listen, when \\"Smoke On The Water\\" is introduced by Gillan the crowd is silent... almost like they're not sure what they're about to hear. The 6 minute drum solo on \\"The Mule\\" was enthralling from Ian Paice - one of my favorite all-time rock drummers. Jon Lord's keyboard work is 2nd to none. His best work on this album is on the songs \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Child In Time\\". Seems that Lord and Blackmore had some great fun dueling back and forth. Some of the tunes, like \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" and \\"Child In Time\\" sound better here than on the studio album. Gillan's interaction with the audience at the end of \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" is priceless. Ritchie Blackmore's trademark guitar sound and blistering solo's are amazing. 7 total songs - short track list but 6 of the 7 songs are 9+ minutes or longer. Two songs (\\"The Mule\\", Strange Kind Of Woman\\") from \\"Fireball\\"; one song (\\"Child In Time\\") from \\"In Rock\\"; and four from \\"Machne Head\\". The album closer is the marathon \\"Space Truckin'\\" clocking in at just under 20 minutes. \\"Made In Japan\\" is a highlight reel of two great shows on the \\"Machine Head Tour\\" in '73. The only thing wrong with this original issue is that it's just not long enough. Now, with the remastered \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition you can buy more of the show. Classic disc (5 stars).ience at the end of \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" is priceless.

The 1.5 crop factor of the Rebel, 10D, 20D, 30D really hurt on the wide angle but make this lense great for all around use. <br /> <br />Photos are crisp and clean if you have enough light or a stationary subject. <br /> <br />Great all around lense.  The best first lense for a 1.5 crop DSLR.  Don't bother with either of the kit lenses.  The 17-85mm is too slow and the 18-55mm is a throw away.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Do you enjoy an illusion less when you know what is going on?  The inevitable question when watching a magic trick being performed is \\"How did they do that?\\"  From time to time there are those (e.g., Penn & Teller), who will reveal the secret behind the trick, and I have usually found that there is as much enjoyment in learning how they pulled it off as there is in watching the trick being performed in the first place.  Such a concern is at the heart of \\"The Illusionist,\\" a 2006 film from writer-director Neil Burger (\\"Interview with an Assassin\\"), adapted from a short story by Steven Millhauser that draws some inspiration from the infamous Mayerling Incident but clearly goes its own way.<br /><br />We begin in Vienna at the previous turn of the century and a performance by Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), at which the title character is arrested by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti).  Apparently Eisenheim is doing something he should not be doing, and all that is revealed throughout the rest of the film until we come full circle to the opening scene and understand its import.  We then learn that once upon a time the young Eisenheim had been friends with the young Sophie, but now he has grown up to be a master illusionist and the hottest thing in Vienna while she is the Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), the presumptive fiancee for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), thereby setting the stage for a deadly love triangle.<br /><br />The Crown Prince is a paragon of arrogant rationality mixed with an indulgent temper who takes Eisenheim's illusions as an intellectual challenge but stops short of demanding Eisenheim tell how he does it.  Uhl is something of an amateur magician regarding card tricks and slight of hand, so he is also curious about the method behind the magic, but respects the professionalism of the performances, at least until the Crown Prince orders him to do otherwise as Sophie appears to be on the verge of choosing the Illusionist over the Crown Prince, a decision that will have deadly consequences.  Eisenheim's illusions are fascinating, but it is the human drama that matters more here.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" has the virtue of a talented cast in what is essentially an art house film (I am somewhat surprised that they all signed on for such a small and intimate period piece, although Biel clearly is trying to show she can act and following the leads of Norton and Giamatti in proving less is more).  This becomes crucial because I suspect most viewers will know the trick that is being played even if they are not sure how it is being pulled off, so Burger's film gets credit for making us more than willing to go along for the ride.  I have a preference for films that are able to fool me from start to finish, but I ended up rounding up on \\"The Illusionist\\" because I applaud the film's final scene and the joy of one character in figuring out how it was done.nce, a decision that will have deadly consequences.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo Arriaga (who have sadly had a falling-out) may be one of the most formidable creative teams in the industry. Without resorting to cheap sentiments or preaching, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu crafts a quietly compelling follow-up to \\"21 Grams,\\" with an introspective look at the interlaced lives after a tragedy.<br /><br />Two boys in Morocco buy a rifle, and while testing it out, they strike a passing tourist bus. Unfortunately, the bullet strikes a vacationing American woman (Cate Blanchett), in the middle of a rural area with no real medical facilities. Unable to be transported, the woman and her husband (Brad Pitt) are dropped off in a rural village, to await help.<br /><br />Unknowingly, the boys have triggered off shattering events in other people's lives across the world -- a troubled, deaf Japanese girl (Rinko Kikuchi) causes a commotion, and the police find that this neglected, lonely teen is the daughter of the man who originally had the boys' rifle. And the American couple's nanny (Adriana Barraza) is delayed going to her son's wedding, and attempts to bring the children into Mexico with her -- with disastrous results.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is like a series of completely different photographs, but with the same person in the background. These haunting looks at how lives can be changed in an instant -- and the effects of violence, whether malicious or careless -- makes up the last volume of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga's \\"Death Trilogy.\\" It illustrates death with the fragility of life.<br /><br />But it's also about the difficulty of communicating in the modern world. You can talk to someone across the world, but sometimes never communicate -- cultures, languages, race, and disabilities can divide people, such as when the border police rush to rescue the American kids, but are callous to the kindly nanny merely because she is not a citizen.<br /><br />And I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu knows how to capture the right feel for the movie, even to giving it shaky, rough cinematography. There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call. And the movie moves seamlessly from the rocky, dusty Morocco to the flashy, frenetic Tokyo to the relaxed San Diego.<br /><br />Blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress. Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year -- and heads should roll if she isn't even nominated!<br /><br />But the supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Kikuchi as the rebellious teenager, who feels isolated from the world around her, and is still grieving from her mother's tragic death. So she acts out sexually. And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.<br /><br />It may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but \\"Babel\\" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film. A brilliant, thought-provoking movie, and one that deserves to be seen.ving it shaky, rough cinematography. There's a feeling of powerful emotion even in small scenes, such as Pitt starting to crumble as he makes a phone call. And the movie moves seamlessly from the rocky, dusty Morocco to the flashy, frenetic Tokyo to the relaxed San Diego.  <br /> <br />Blanchett and Pitt are at the center of the movie (in that order), and both are excellent. Blanchett gives a stunning performance as the critically wounded wife, and Pitt acquits himself well as her anguished husband, as they rediscover their love under duress. Blanchett's performance should definitely garner her an Oscar next year -- and heads should roll if she isn't even nominated!  <br /> <br />But the supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Kikuchi as the rebellious teenager, who feels isolated from the world around her, and is still grieving from her mother's tragic death. So she acts out sexually. And Barraza gives a solid performance as the nanny, in a nightmarish situation that is particularly haunting because it really happens.  <br /> <br />It may comment on the lack of communication between cultures and people, but \\"Babel\\" is so compelling in its acting and visuals that it could easily have been a silent film. A brilliant, thought-provoking movie, and one that deserves to be seen.
B000K4WPCC|2.0|Just consider it a male version of \\"The Craft\\" -- \\"The Covenant\\" is basically a flimsy witchcraft story dressed up with lots of male eye candy. The candy is nice for the eyes, but it would have been nice to have a little meat for the brain as well.<br /><br />Ipswich has four (used to be five) witch families, and the eldest son inherits a dangerous bunch of magic in his early teens, before coming into his full power at eighteen (do I smell another magic/sexual maturity analogy here?). They mainly use these powers as... well, the way you'd expect any teen boys to. But then the body of a student is found in a car, and the sons of Ipswich are suspected.<br /><br />And Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) starts to figure out that something weird is happening -- ghosts, magical peeping-toms, and a mysterious student who just transferred there. Not only must Caleb stop the magical attacks -- but keep his own burgeoning powers under control too, as he confronts the secret enemy.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" is pure fluff from start to finish, and at times it feels like it isn't aspiring to be much more -- the plot is quite basic and rather suspenseless, since the bad guy practically has a \\"REALLY SINISTER AND CREEPY\\" sign around his neck -- and a five-year-old could guess who he is just by the backstory.<br /><br />In a way, it feels bad to kick such an unpretentiously popcorn movie, but it could have been way better -- instead, it's loaded with with cliches galore. There are a few cool scenes, such as a car flying apart and reconstructing -- quite nice, visually speaking.<br /><br />But the rest of the time, it's just predictable and rather cheesy -- dialogue is extremely teen-movie (\\"You ready to say \\"uncle\\"?\\" \\"I'm ready for you to go to hell!\\"), and the climax is like a magic-powerball-throwing fight from a bad children's anime.<br /><br />The actors are there basically for the looks, and they form a pretty typical circle -- good boy, shy boy, bad boy, and mischief-maker. Not great acting, but most of them won't make you openly cringe. And of course, they toss in some teen-movie starlets, who don't really register, as the token girlfriends.<br /><br />\\"The Covenant\\" is pure popcorn, with a load of cliches -- might be fun for a watch after two A.M., when nothing else is on. During daylight, there are countless better things on.enly cringe.
