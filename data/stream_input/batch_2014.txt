B0009QTS1M|5.0|an excellent tale of ancient gladiators and one man's quest to avenge his family that were taken from him. Russell Crowe at his finest.
0395389496|5.0|My daughter loves this book, as well as the movie. Enjoy telling this story every year and then as a family enjoying the movie together.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|It is scary how bad teenagers from other parts of the world have it.  As a teacher I use parts of this for my classroom.  Some of it though is too brutal for even teens.  The violence and drug use that these kids endured is to tough to think about.  Read it first and have a frank discussion with your teen before you turn them loose on this book.
0525457585|5.0|I was first introduced to this story through the movie. Finally ordered the book and love it. Cannot wait to share this book/story with my daughter.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Their music is so catchy, I always sing out loud to their music when I'm alone in the car ;)
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is interesting, but I do not recommend it to anyone who is squeamish. This book talks about some very hard concepts that become frighteningly real. This master piece brings to life the horrifying concept of not being able to chose or to be an individual. I love this book but it is sad and inappropriate for a young reader.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I enjoy most of the most of the music on this cd. There are a few songs that are a little too slow but that's just my taste.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this.  not super hard but entertaining and a fun way to pass some time. I Gog ghrogh it in a day on the medium level.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Doesn't work on Kindle Fire HD even though advertising indicated it would.  Hope someone will come up with a solution.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I don't like HOG and thankfully this is not one of those.  I really enjoyed this game. The only complaint  that I would have is that I wish the game could have been longer.  I hope to see more games like this!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|any girl that wants too have great time it is great and all the people that says it is bad they are wrong.:)
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|This game is very addicting!  Definitely makes you think. You have to plan (backwards) how that mouse is going to get to the cheese!  Through obstacles...THE CAT...THE RAT...the dog....good mind exercise!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I love John Green and everything he writes. Even though it's young adult fiction, anyone can enjoy this book. Well written!
B0098G67TU|5.0|This is a timeless, classic film that will never get old. I remember the first time a saw this movie when I was younger and it's still just as great!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book cover-to-cover in four hours, and didn't even mind staying up until 3AM to finish it. It's rare that books can make me cry, but this accomplished that in such a good way. I bought this book for three other friends after reading it myself!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great story and with excellent character development. The story kept you interested from the very beginning and kept you excited on every page.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|Would not recommend, turned off after watching first 10 to 15 minutes feared the rest was just as awful and I couldn't get that time back.  This movie no kid should watch.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is addicting and it sometimes makes me rage but it still is a boss game better get it before the price goes up
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well written and a real page-turner which maintained interest throughout. i would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this subject. We need to know more about  real life heroes.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't put the story down. Will anxiously await the next volume in the ongoing saga. Imaginative storytelling. Think girls/women will especially enjoy the read.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Heath's performance in this movie was far beyond my original expectation and from the very start of the movie I found that I had underestimated him.<br />This sequel to Batman Begins continued to shine and further raise the bar of what a comic based movie should be.
B008476HBM|5.0|Just an amazing book com the older days to read and the characters are so superb in actions and words
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The beginning to the best Batman movies that have been made. Christian Bale plays both Bruce Wayne and Batman like no live action actor has been able to before him.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman has been the best comic to movie series to date and set a new standard for what is to be expected of a comic based movie.
0307720950|4.0|Being a maker myself, this book was a nice reminder that what I do is not completely crazy.  I was already familiar with  most of the examples (people, places, and things) given in the book, but there were interesting details about many of them that I was unaware of.  I'm glad Chris Anderson took the time to share some of the stories he was privy to as an industry insider, as well as sharing insight gained from his own experiences.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the book was that it seemed many of the core concepts contained within it were constantly being repeated, and not always in different ways.  This kind of made it seem like he was regurgitating some of the content as filler material just to make it voluminous enough for a book instead of just a couple of blog articles.  While repetition is the mother of learning, I found myself skimming past passages that appeared to be repeated information from other parts of the book.<br /><br />That said, the book was an enjoyable read and serves both as encouragement for anyone with a maker spirit, as well as an explanation as to why we do what we do for the acquaintances and loved ones of those same makers.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The beginning to one of the best TV series I have seen. An epic story that must be seen from the beginning. White walkers, dire wolves and dragons, oh my!
B00ARW2XJW|1.0|I found this fairly useless on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  Interesting concept but it didn't work for me.  It either showed no temperature or the wrong temperature.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Love this movie, I watched it repeatedly when it was first made and streaming online. I am glad to now own the Blu-ray quality version of it.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Seems to work alright most of the time.  Lately, it hasn't been tuning on when I add the charger plug.  Pretty slick app, from what I see but the other reviews have thrown up a red flag and I'll have to watch and see what happens.  It may be safer to simply remove it and watch the built-in charging bar although it's more work to get displayed.  Because of the other reviewers ratings, I'll knock my rating down a notch.  Nice display, though.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A long time Led Zeppelin fan, I was reinvigorated by this live DVD. The only thing that could have been better is if I was at the show!

I am a sucker for puzzle games and I really like the fact that this game actually is a hidden object game like it says not just another game with a hidden object mini game or something...love it, worth the time now that they have fixed most of the bugs worked out.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being  WallFlower was perhaps the most beautiful novel that I have ever read. Throughout the whole novel, with every sentence emotion was present. As I was reading the novel I felt just like Charlie, I felt like crying, screaming and at times I didn't even recognize who I was. Furthermore, every time I would pick up my Kindle to read this wonderful piece of literature I was always excited and nervous as to what I was going to read. This book made me cry countless times and maybe it wasn't because I had experienced all that Charlie went through, but because I normally feel lonely, forgotten and left out. This is a struggle that I have been fighting for quite sometime. For this reason I have decided to write about me and my life, maybe not to be  published, but at least to vent and release all of the feelings inside of me that I have buried down inside  me. Nevertheless, thank you Charlie and thank you (the author) for providing me with something that in this moment of time I needed so desperately. Stay pure and stay infinite.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this app is so fun you can shoot and use your light saber and even use the force.<br />thank you

B001FEAA3C|5.0|Of course we can't call contemporary music, especially \\"pop\\" classical, that is for history to decide.  Around 20 years ago, I was young, the Texas scene was changing from stoic 2-step to a freedom of whatever you wanted and when Texas lets loose, they let loose.  In 1983 Yes had a song, Owner of a lonely heart that went though some serious music change in the middle of the song, remember?  Anyway, I've never seen any UTubes of the dancing to that song but I sure remember that it was an excuse to get funky, or robot, or cowboy, or whatever in the realm of modern dance you wanted to do the song gave you a reason to change up your dance.  I'm sure the academics have a word for it, all I know is the clubs and dance scene loved it.  So what does that have to do with the Tea in China?<br /><br />One warm spring evening in West Texas, a house party at Ernest and Vivians, the kids are itching to join the spring but just couldn't get into it yet.  Maybe a little early in the evening or the prime mover of dancing souls, hadn't sprinkled his dance dust o'er the crowd.  The times were ripe, just not at the tipping point where the rafters are rockin'... remember?  Hearing the into to Life During Wartime was exactly like the time signature change in Lonely Heart.  The keyboards announce the song, a slow drum beat adds the baseline.  Bryne knows how to build a feeling into a song.  Hearing the first phrase of the song gives me time to get a few people to the middle of the living-room (devoid of any dancers yet).  I hit the first drum beat in air-drum style and we take our marks, stirring around like the alpha dancers we were.  On the cymbal crash the song takes off straight up and in the next 30 seconds 40 folks are celebrating life. Can you picture it?<br /><br />  \\"This ain't no disco\\" is apropos even after Gilley's.  You have to make time to dance.  And while Byrne may say that lyrics are overrated, there is something about hollerin' \\"This ain't no party, this ain't no foolin'around\\"  whilst you fool around at some party.... is rich.<br /><br /> I think this is one of the greatest dance songs ever. 40 friends knew it that nite.  I'm so looking to read his book \\"How music Works\\".  Thanks, dear reader, did I say anything that you didn't already know?  Whatever, it's fun, fun, fun for me.<br />m.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, but I was disappointed. Rowling has a gift for exposition and creating a vivid, believable world - as we saw with Harry Potter (which is the only mention I'll make of her famous series). Her flair for detailed explanation did not serve her in the setting of &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; because the reader already knows this world and she didn't use it to her advantage in relation to character development. Rowling repeated herself over and over while trying to fill-in the characters' personalities without varying the message or delivery. I didn't think the book picked up and found its plot until at least 70% of the way through. It was dull and seemed to be more about bashing a point in about the need for welfare than any recognizable plot. Too many characters, too much exposition, too little action.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie was good.  Bruce Willis was his normal great-acting self. The story line was a bit odd.  I'm glad we rented this movie, but we probably would not wish to see it again.  One time is good, no need for two.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I am not a big war movie buff, but I have often wanted to watch Patton, an award-winning 1970 film starring George Patton, the major general in the battle against the Germans.  The DVD is great with a large choice of languages and special features.  I did not understand why, when I clicked on the \\"audio history of Patton\\" that the DVD returned me to the film.  Very odd.  Despite that anomaly, the film is quite well done.<br /><br />It's a long movie, almost three hours.  But you're not aware of the time as you really become part of the action.<br /><br />The battle scenes, the tanks and the unfortunate end of some of the soldiers was hard to watch.  The realism of the film was further augmented by the excellent acting:  Patton as the gruff, can't-keep-his-mouth-shut SOB, who has very sharp opinions of the Nazi's, the soldier who he gives the Purple Heart, and the berating he gives to another for being a coward, including pulling out his Colt pistols to put the kid out of his misery!<br /><br />You are on the battlefield as Patton recalls his earlier lives fighting with the Romans as they took Carthage, reminiscing as he gives Rommel a run for his money, and the humorous exchange with his British rival, Montgomery, as they take Sicily and eventually the overthrow of the Third Reich.<br />Recommended, especially for WWII buffs.  The realism and accuracy is great to behold!<br /><br />Franklin J. Schaffner<br /> Director<br />CAST<br />George C. Scott<br /> General George S Patton Jr<br /><br />Karl Malden<br /> General Omar N Bradley<br /><br />Michael Bates<br /> Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery<br /><br />Stephen Young<br /> Captain Chester B Hansen<br /><br />Michael Strong<br /> Brigadier General Hobart Carver

You get to race, feed, clean, and pretty much a lot of things with your horse! I urge you to try it out! If your a horse lover you will really love it!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Ten people are invited to Soldier Island for a very strange vacation. Each guest is hiding a secret from their past. One of them may be hiding murderous intent. Could it be their host, U. N. Own? One after another, they fall. Who is going to be left in the end?  This is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mysteries. I loved this novel because it's a very smart whodunit with so much psychological suspense that it made me listen for footsteps at night. The characters are so unique that when thrown together in this surreal conflict, the reader will need to decide who they believe is the most guilty and the most innocent.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|My review of the game is that it is a great game and all but it does have its drawbacks such as sometimes crashes in game and most of the time you do not have enough space. I also think it is over priced for a single game when the computer version is free so that does not make sense. After all this it is a pretty good game try it out yourself but recommend trying the computer version first before playing. Hope this helps.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Fast-paced, intelligent yet easy to follow.  The movie wastes no time getting underway, and holds your interest throughout.  Not a bad thing, also, that Matt Damon is quite hot!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The install process is fairly straight-forward, although the directions could be fleshed out more by CoolerMaster. The illustrations are small and detail is lacking. However, the install process is simple enough that it can be figured out based on the minimal directions and the parts included.<br /><br />From start to finish the install process took about 1.5 hours, including prep and cleanup time. My Antec P280 case has the back of the motherboard exposed for just this purpose (swapping CPU heatsinks), so I didn't have to take out my motherboard to install it which saved a bunch of time. Otherwise consider doubling that time estimate. Regardless, if you are handy with a Phillip's screwdriver and general common sense, installation shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />The 212 is quite tall, so make sure you take measurements before you order. My Antec P280 is a very large &#34;mid&#34; tower (should be classified as a full tower), and it fits with about an inch or so to spare. If you have 120mm fans on the back or top of your case, chances are it will fit. But this isn't a given. Just measure it to be sure.<br /><br />The 212 can be mounted either horizontally or vertically, depending on preference. I have mine mounted horizontally so that it blows the exhaust up toward the top case fans, which in turn exhaust the hot air out. I have one filtered intake on the back of my case, which blows directly toward the 212's intake. I also have the 212's fan oriented so that air is &#34;pulled&#34; through the heatsink, rather than &#34;pushed&#34;. The 212 was set up to push air through the heatsink from the factory. I'm not sure this makes much difference, but it seemed to make more sense to have it pull the air through the heatsink.<br /><br />On the ASUS Sabertooth R2.0 AMD 3+ mobo, a drawback to mounting the 212 horizontally is it makes the closest DIMM socket inaccessible. So If I decide to add additional sticks of RAM the 212 will have to be removed. The 212's heatsink sits high enough to clear my already installed G.Skill Ripjaws RAM (F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL)--which do have heatsinks on them--by about 1/4 inch or so.<br /><br />The stock cooler for my AMD FX 8350 (which is also a CoolerMaster product) screams under load, which is the main reason why I went looking for an aftermarket cooling solution. The Hyper 212 on the other hand is very quiet by comparison. It is noticeable under full load, but quiet enough to not be annoying. The stock 8350 cooler is simply obnoxious.<br /><br />Besides the much quieter fan, the other great feature is the reduced operating temps. With the stock cooler I was running around 53 degrees Celsius during gaming, now it runs around 43 degrees. Under test loads with Prime95 (maximum FPU stress test), I was running as high as 61 degrees Celsius with the stock cooler, but the Hyper 212 keeps it around 52 degrees Celsius or so. At idle with the 212 the CPU sits at about 28 degrees Celsius. With the stock cooler it would idle around 37-38 degrees Celsius. The 212 seems to keep the CPU about 10 degrees Celsius cooler across the board.<br /><br />I don't have this processor overclocked at the moment and probably won't because it's plenty powerful enough for my needs. But if you plan on overclocking you may want to take advantage of the second fan option for a push/pull set up.<br /><br />The 212 package does include a small tube of thermal compound (enough for several uses) and an adapter so you use your Phillip's screwdriver to seat the nuts onto the backplate. It also comes with additional brackets to mount a second fan. Basically, everything you need to complete the installation is included in the package (except the screwdriver).<br /><br />Assuming your case can accommodate its size, this is probably the best air cooling solution for the money.s high enough to clear my already installed G.Skill Ripjaws RAM (F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL)--which do have heatsinks on them--by about 1/4 inch or so.<br /><br />The stock cooler for my AMD FX 8350 (which is also a CoolerMaster product) screams under load, which is the main reason why I went looking for an aftermarket cooling solution.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Not a bad game I hate the fact that you have to spend real money to move through the game quickly. And I don't like the fact that you have to post some stuff to Facebook to move forward.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book I could not put down. Being abused in the past, this book helped me realize how blessed I am to have gotten out of the relationship. For at least half the book I could hardly breathe. Anyone whose been in similar situations should read this book.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Christopher Nolan has done an outstanding job in making this franchise shine.  Christian Bale is probably the best &#34;Batman&#34; to date (hopefully no one gets creative and wants to re-launch...again!)

0307593312|5.0|I admit, I'd never read anything by this very famous Japanese author. I read the book straight thru with nary a pause, though it's possible if it were a new/less known author I may have put it down. The first point is that it transformed me into Japan of about 30 years ago; with all the Japanese locales, etc., that in itself was worthwhile. The multi-dimensional, eerie plot was easy to follow. Some bizarre activities and humor also kept me reading. Maybe it dragged here and there, but some of the cultural and literary references were well placed; like Chekhov's trips across Russia, tunes like \\"Paper Moon\\", Isak Dinesen's Africa..the list goes on. I found the twists and turns into strange cults, odd assassins (one of the main characters), Schooldays of the past, unseemly sexual encounters (not quite pornographic in this day and age), oddball ugly detectives who may even be a little lovable at that!, Japanese hospitals and funerals (towards the end)..not to mention really getting into the minds of everyone, all again with the Japanese outlook dreamily interesting...Throw in Proust and you can't miss!  All these references I found to have a real significance in the plot- lines, and character build-ups. Perhaps the ending was slightly lackluster, but I almost felt a sense of \\"I am there\\" throughout the book, and now can clearly remember many of the scenes and characters with near-crystal clarity.And with a near-gothic atmosphere thrown in at times, creepy storms, and all the rest, this makes for a merry read, even with a few authorial excesses. So that's why I give this one 5-stars!

0765325950|5.0|Is it perfect? no, but it is an amazing ending to a series I've been reading since I was 12. There is about a 200 page section that is probably the best part of the entire series. Buy it, read it, and be satisfied. who cares about the fact that there's no ebook version?
0740748475|5.0|I bought this for myself for christmas and I love it. The cartoon itself is so deep and multidimensional that it will persist through time as one of the great works of the century, despite its medium. It's absolutely a masterpiece that Watterson put together for years.<br />Children should be introduced and well versed on the work as it tactfully teaches about subjects large and small alike.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first down loaded this book, I just thought it was going to be another love story, but it wasn't.  I couldn't put the book down, I was reading it all the time.  I loved the love story and all the twist and turn this book takes.  All the questions I had, got all answered in the end.  I found my self telling all kinds of people about my book.  I loved it.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I purchased the DVD version a number of years ago and decided to upgrade to the Bluray.  I am disappointed to find out that the Bluray version does not include the same bonus features as the DVD set does - namely, it doesn't include Disc 5, which holds Planet Earth - The Future.  *sigh*  Also the cardboard cover arrived scratched up.  Kinda wishing I hadn't spent the money upgrading to Bluray as the DVD series includes more footage.  Too bad.  The cinematography is still phenomenal though, so it's worth buying as long as you don't care about lack of the extra 150 minutes of bonus footage.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a well written book. I have read several books on Seals and I thought this was one of the best.
0765325950|5.0|I have read and re-read this series many times over the last 20+ years.  I was just as worried as the rest of the world about the direction of the series after Jordan's death.  Sanderson took over for the last three books, and I can truly say that it felt as though he just did not know or get the characters for \\"Gathering Storm\\", or \\"Towers of Midnight\\" and I was worried about \\"A Memory of Light\\".  That being said, this book was outstanding.  Sanderson managed to step up, bring it all together.  Without letting go with spoilers galore, this book had everything, Tragedy, Humor, Romance, Action (galore), Drama, and so much else.  If you have not yet read this book, purchase it and read it.  If you are not familiar with the series, get the series, and familiarize yourselves with it.
0385523912|5.0|Journalists can sometimes be sloppy with facts, but Barbara Demick is highly conscious of the fragility of her sources, and this is reporting of the first order. The author, the Beijing bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times, spent several years in South Korea and visited its northern counterpart a number of times. Nothing to Envy is the product of interviews, taken over the years, with a dozen or so North Koreans who managed to make it and escape. It is an invaluable testimony as to daily life in the so-called hermit kingdom, and indeed one of the many striking points of the book is not just how little one knows but how little one will ever know about North Korea. Who can tell what its inhabitants think of the regime they labour under? It seems, according to Nothing to Envy, that many and perhaps most believed the lies about a socialist paradise until the death of Kim Il Sung and the 1990s famine. But who knows what they believe today? Not even those who govern them, probably, such are the terrible penalties for speaking one's thoughts in North Korea.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy shows a society that actually conforms to Orwell's 1984. It tells of a tragedy so awful and so staggering that it demands to be read about. It also reminded me of Paul Auster's dystopian novel In the Country of Last Things, in which nothing ever gets made anymore, and people just strip everything at hand, the last remnants of civilization, machines, appliances, building parts, clothes, in order to survive. Such was the horror of the 1990s economic collapse, bringing famine, innumerable deaths, malnutrition, and the stunting of a whole generation. But Demick's account is about ordinary people, and amazingly in the middle of this, in spite of all the waste and insanity, they managed to hold jobs, fall in love, care about family members, have hopes. This is indeed what makes the book readable. Nothing to Envy tells the stories of ordinary people, and it is a moving if so often absolutely wrenching account. Demick finished writing the book at the end of the last decade. Sadly, the North Korean regime is still, several years later and in spite of often-repeated predictions, in existence. Perhaps reading about it may at least make a small difference in that these people's suffering will not remain entirely silent.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|love the series, hated the fact that after watching for a period of 20 minutes, the program kept reloading every 5 minutes.  Amazon has alot of improving to do on its video transmission before I would consider renting a movie or show again.  I also contacted customer service when i first had the problem with episode  1, season 2,  she assured me it would not occur again.  I bought episode2, and guess what? same thing happened again.  Silly me for believing that they fixed the problem.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since discovering the Piano Guys on YouTube I have been in love with their music. They make music fun and easy to listen to. Everyone would enjoy these guys. Now I wish that they would sell the videos they make too so I can watch them anytime - even when I am not connected to an internet.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After a short browse, this book attracted me because of the high number of praising reviews. Bought it, started reading, and slept 3 hours that night, then continued reading, finished. It is one of the most captivating books I've ever read and it clearly shows the talent of the author. I highly recommend it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My boys love it!  It is definitely addicting!  Lots of fun for all those Star Wars and Angry Birds fans.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works really well with Kindle Fire HD. No problem after installing it. Very simple to use if familiar with FB.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Almost half-way through Season Eight and I'm still guessing as to whether Amanda is Good or Evil.  Or if there is such a thing as Good;  maybe it's all nasty corporate politics and everyone and everything is evil or not quite as evil with a few truly Evil creatures thrown in.  And the only thing the boys can rely on is each other (as they are once again back to a dangerously co-dependent relationship.)  Castiel is under Naomi's thrall, would kill the boys in an instant if she told him to, and I can definitely see a possibility of that happening.  So, back to Amanda being evil or not so evil...<br /><br />Like the previous seasons, the underlying storyline is interesting and they cast the perfect actress to be the (possibly) evil controlling character.  Amanda Tapping is a very versatile actress and a joy to watch.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I have seen the original with Sly Stallone and while Karl Urban can't say \\"I AM THE LAW!\\" with as much gusto, The Kiwi from Wellington is far more scarier.  The difference between both movies is this one is far more faithful to the 2000AD comics, such as Dredd NEVER takes off his helmet!  Yep...no seeing Karl's face or lovely eyes, ladies.  His body in that tight leather lower half of the uniform however - YES!!!!  Okay...back to the movie.  It is gritty, ugly and really not for the kiddies thanks to all the digital blood splashes, exploding head shots and insanely high kill count.<br /><br />The extras are beyond cool for the uber geeks (yes, I'm one!), in particular when they give you the entire back story to creating Judge Dredd and interview writers (Mark Millar's interview is BRILLIANT!)and artists.  The extras also touch on creating the world of Mega City One and the special effects used to portray the influence of the movie's drug \\"SLO-MO\\".<br /><br />Overall - not in the monetary calibur of \\"Avengers!\\", but who cares!  The movie rocks, the villians are evil, there are surprises at every turn - and Karl Urban proves he can be THE LAW!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Like it well enough for a Nicholas sparks book liked the lucky one better I think in the long run

B005LAIGYQ|3.0|I really wanted to love this film about US Navy SEALs, but I was ultimately slightly disappointed and below, I will try to explain more in detail why it happened. This review contains some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />To begin with the good stuff, the action scenes in this film were VERY good. There are three major fights in \\"Act of valor\\" and they are really impressive, filmed in a way as realistic as possible, in a style reminding a little of \\"Blackhawk down\\". Absolutely nothing to criticize there.<br /><br />Although not an expert on the military things, considering that US Navy closely collaborated in making of this film ans some real ex-Navy SEALs played in it, I believe that the description of weapons, equipments, vehicles and tactics was as close to the reality as it was possible without revealing too much of professional secrets - and indeed, this film has a feeling of \\"real stuff\\". Once again, nothing to criticize here.<br /><br />I also agree with the ideology of this film and its martial message. There are indeed evil people out there who either want to make money of other people's suffering (like drug traffickers) or want to murder other people just because they do not share their beliefs (like islamic extremists) - and if their threat becomes too serious to ignore they must be taken out (killed or captured) by those who defend civilized societies, which means mostly professional soldiers and spies. Period.<br /><br />However, even with all the above, I didn't enjoy this film as much as I hoped, mostly because of a very weak scenario. Without revealing too much, I must however say that all the intelligence aspects of this film seemed to be expedited in the fastest possible way - whereas in the real world intelligence gathering is an excruciatingly difficult and time consuming task.<br /><br />Also, for the life of me I can not understand why the criminals (weapons and drug traffickers) were so eager to join with terrorists in the plot against United States. Money is earned to be enjoyed and if one is dead, his fortune is of no use - and being part of a really huge terrorist attack against the world leading superpower offers poor prospects of survival.<br /><br />Finally I rather didn't like the fact that the leading villain was a Russian converted to islam and connected to Chechnyan rebels - in the real world, Chechen guerillas, even the most extremist, never targeted US interests. Also, maybe by an excess of precautions, no bad guys from radical islamic organisation are Arabs but instead they are all Moros from southern Philippines.<br /><br />Considering that most of SEALs are played by real ex-SEALs and not by actors, it is hardly fair to criticize their acting and anyway it is not so bad. But there can be no excuses for the scenarist who wrote the dialogs, which are so atrociously boring that in the second part of the film I really hoped that somebody will start shooting, just to not hear them anymore. I ultimately fast forwarded some conversations just because the great final raid.<br /><br />The ending, on another hand, was pretty moving and I fully agree with its message - we must be grateful to those who labour, suffer and risk their lives so we, simple citizens, can enjoy our life and freedom without fear.<br /><br />I do not regret that I bought and watched this film, but I definitely didn't enjoy it as much as \\"Blackhawk down\\" and I do not think I will keep my DVD. Still, it is worth to be watched once, for the great action scenes. Enjoy!es.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|I really did like this.<br />I have heard from many people that Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress but she wasn't too bad in this.<br />Oh and Charlize Theron was wonderful.
B004YSDT52|5.0|This was a great flick. Living in Alaska for a short time, you do forget it's evening when the sun is bright and shining out the window. You do lose some wits about yourself. The fog is dangerous and nothing you have experienced before, because it could stay all day and all night. Overall, I really liked this movie and believe it was overlooked when it was in theaters.
B00870ZH3U|2.0|Oh boy where do I even begin!!<br /><br />First let me say that what I am about to write will be SPOILERS, So read no further unless you want to know what happens.<br /><br />They actually changed things about the original Phantom of the Opera (POTO) to try to make this sequel work and it was very disappointing!<br />Any of you who have seen POTO remember the final lair scene where Christine kisses Erik (phantom) and the look on his face is just pure shock because no one has EVER kissed him or shown him any affection at all.<br />Now in the sequel Love Never Dies it turns out that Christines son is actually Eriks......COME ON!!! and you find out that they actually made love one night all those years ago.<br />So then why did Erik act so shocked when Christine kissed him in POTO?<br /><br />I just feel this sequel was a feeble attemp to make more cash off of POTO.<br /><br />I actually felt mad and disgusted watching this.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is by far my favorite game on my kindle, the only thing I don't like is that there are not as many of the features that are on the I pad version.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I am not an avid TV viewer, but this series had me hooked on the first episode.  Thrilling, suspenseful, creative, twisty, and dark.  I also love the way the characters have changed roles since season 1.  Completely unexpected and brilliant!

B001B2CPH2|5.0|Always a great movie and have seen it about 3 times. Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as the confused physic and provides humour and 'normal' for a series of events, when taken alone, are very sad. Good play of good against evil and also how corporate life can lead even hardy souls astray.

Its on there for a second or so. Sloppy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is one of those books I've read multiple times and still keep coming back to. It seems that I always notice something I missed before or I get a different meaning out of the novel. There's a lot to catch because there's so much going on in this book, including multiple themes, personal discovery and reflection, and complex political issues. The story revolves around Ender, a young and brilliantly gifted boy that is recruited to \\"Battle School\\", an academy located in space whose purpose is to train young soldiers in the fight against the dreaded buggers. Though the plot sounds simplistic, the story within it is intricate and detailed. The characters within the book are some of the most realistic you'll find in a book, displaying everyday emotions such as fear, regret, vengeful, helplessness, and disdain. This makes the story so much more powerful due to the fact that the members of Battle School are all children, most of them under the age of twelve. The plot itself moves along at a very nice pace, establishing the characters throughout the first act while describing their actions in Battle School throughout the rest. The real joy of the book is the Battle Room; a zero-gravity room used to train soldiers in the art of combat and war tactics. It's here that Ender spends most of his time and it's an idea that was way ahead of it's time. The descriptions of the soldiers' scrimmages are vivid and detailed and make for some of the coolest scenes in any sci-fi novel. It's a truly terrific book that you won't want to put down.

If you enjoy those classic fairytales this show is for you and has a very interesting twist on characters and stories. Just watiing to see what new character comes next is great. Plus for all you Lost fans, which I've never watched it, there is a lot of Lost Easter Eggs in the show.
1469273802|5.0|Best Clancy book I've listen to yet. Full of action and moves rapidly. It is a topic that our Government should be paying attention to. People in this country, for that matter, should be aware of the threat this book does an excellent expose on. This country is setting itself up for exactly what transpires in the book.<br /><br />I've had a 40 year computer science career and I can tell you Cyber warfare is real. It is not some fictional creation. I don't know a lot about espionage or spooks but I do understand a lot about computers and communications networks. Therefore, this book really reached out and grabbed me. It is reality to me. Should be on every Congressperson's reading list.

B000FC10WU|3.0|Not riveting however I didn't solve it before the end. It was refreshing to read a book without borderline porn or gore.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I  found the book to be well written. It kept my interest to the point that I had a hard time putting it down long enough to do anything productive. All three books in the trilogy were unusual,fascinating and thought provoking.  I loved that the two Main characters survived their horrors, had a family and that love conquered all.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl Really enjoyed the relationship issues, the surprises and the cross genre of the novel. A very different mystery

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by Amazon and have to say that I am highly satisfied with this purchase and look forward to the second book.This book met all my requirements for a great book, it was over 2oo pages, had romance, and was well written. So if you are looking for a good read I would recommend this for anyone that enjoys a good read involving magic, knights, or an underdog overcoming adversity.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|This is a cute game, and the girls love it, but like others have said, once they choose the Mushroom Power, it stops and goes into \\"processing\\".  This requires you to reboot the kindle to play again.  I hope they fix it.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|but if you like Ken Follett and you liked the first book in this trilogy - then you will like this volume.<br />This was my first Kindle purchase.  I am undecided on ebooks.  The kindle version was only $2 cheaper than the hardback copy.  I understand this is the fallout from the lawsuit - but - and this is my preference - for the money I will go with the hard copies in the future.
B0091ICDHU|4.0|Really great story. Very emotional. Loved all of the characters. I highly recommend reading this and the sequel! Could barely turn off my Kindle each night.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you have been a John Grisham fan like me since 'The Firm' and 'The Pelican Brief', and have read every single book he wrote, and every time you buy his book, you tell yourself, heck! I am not buying another book of his. Well, you are in for a surprise. I have not bought his last several books and borrowed them from my local library electronically. So this one is no different. I was #69 in line when I put in my request, but amazingly my local library had 14 copies, which is almost unheard of. So patiently I waited. My turn came, and I started reading and was hooked non-stop, which had not happened to a Grisham book in a long time. I finished reading it in 24 hours. The story is good, as well as the characters. I also like the suspense which keeps you thinking like where is he going? I am not going to tell you about the story since I think it will spoil the mystery. But I think you will agree this is one of the better Grisham in latter years.

The characters were believable only lacking in polish or commitment that a more trained or experienced actor might possess. That said, the dancing and choreography are extraordinary and exciting. I watched it and watched it again with my kids. Again, exciting, inspiring and sweet. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Excellent profoundly deep movie about relationships and life timing - if you a good romantic chic flick this one is for you :)
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, as I do all of Sophie Kinsella's books! I would recommend it for anyone.  Cheers!
B001EKP5FK|5.0|If you are a Streisand fan - you have to own these three movies ... profound movies that reflected many of the issues of the moment in society - a definite must have for your DVD collection :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I havent noticed anything bad about the game so far, its very enjoyable. Id suggest it to anyone who likes horses or horse games.
142314189X|5.0|Bought these books for my little brother for christmas and he just absolutely loved them! He has already read the first 3 books and is trying to pretty much reenact everything he has read so far. It's great to see him get into books so much
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game but dont like the pop ups right before you start to play.Easy to play and like that you can choose your game type.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY KINDLE, READ MAYBE HALF OF IT AND IT DISCONTINUED.  JUST STOPPED AND I COULD NOT GET IT BACK ALTHOUGH, IT SAID AND I TRIED REPEATLY TO CONTACT AMAZON IF PURCHASED.  THE BOOK WAS GOOD, AND I GUESS I AM UPSET WITH AMAZON.
B00847UYWA|3.0|Good, but as problematic from a modern point of view<br />as others have said.  The mini-series &#34;king in yellow&#34;<br />is tantalizing, though I respectfully disagree with Lovecraft,<br />I believe the first story to be the masterpiece,  though it is<br />a masterpiece of satirical science fiction which wasn't<br />Lovecraft's interest.  The other tales are good<br />although weaker.  The time travel tale is charming<br />and beautifully written; Chambers is a good writer<br />in this particular book and should not be disparraged<br />simply because he wrote in other genres.<br /><br />The second set of tales are enjoyable,<br />though far more conventional, which is why<br />they so thoroughly disappoint the sci-fi/<br />horror crowd.  As a look into the Parisian<br />Art crowd of the era it's fun and the characterizations<br />are very good.  The endings of two stories are as<br />previously reported, disappointing, tacked on.<br /><br />If you are a Lovecraftian,  you should read the<br />first five stories at least.  They may inspire you<br />just as they did H.P.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The graphics are good but I didn't play it for a week and I had to restart the game but I did get to still be the same level when it restarted. So it was a good game overall.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I did not want to put this game down! The story line was captivating! The ending left me satisfied with a hint of a sequel. Another great game from G5!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I absolutely loved this version! It did come a couple of days late, so if you need it to come exactly on time, beware. Other than that, it was great! The colors all look fine. The movie itself was, of course, amazing. I'm very glad I bought it!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I finally saw this movie today, after reading plenty of reviews, both positive and negative.<br />Sometimes a movie just calls to me, and this is one of them. So, I took the plunge and purchased it.<br />What I discovered was a film that was, at once, chilling and hard to watch at times, yet riveting.<br />In my adventures in this life, I've met these people. This could have easily been filmed in southeastern Ohio or the hills outside of Cincinnati; I've spent time in both (circa 1970's), and have known my share of speed freaks.<br />But, what I wasn't expecting was the way the film started haunting me, a good hour after I'd watched it. That, to me, is a hallmark of a great film. Not to mention how it stirred up some long-buried memories.<br />Jennifer Lawrence deserves all the accolades that have been bestowed upon her for this role. And John Hawkes was outstanding! I've been a fan of his since \\"The Perfect Storm\\".<br />But I must give a special shout-out to Dale Dickey. Her \\"Merab\\" was chilling and real! I wouldn't want to meet her in a dark alley. But, the way she did right by Ree in the end almost made me like her.<br />As if you couldn't tell, I highly recommend this film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best app ever for horse lover's like me. can't. say anything else about it just a lil slow but still the best app
B00004W221|5.0|This movie shows what perseverence, even against the most incredible odds, can accomplish.  It also restores one's faith in the goodness of mankind.
1451695195|5.0|I saw an interview with Dr. Eben Alexander on Oprah and was spellbound.  I read the book and found it life changing and have in turn purchased numerous copies and passed on to friends and family.
034580404X|5.0|Am just finishing the first book.  Very sensual and entertaining to read.  Very easy read.  Looking forward to the sencond and third books in the series.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Mildly entertaining.  Did not like Matthew McConoughy in this movie. Should have waited until I could watch it on Netflix for free. Wasted $3.95
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Nice collection of Taylor's music.  She has her own sound and I enjoy it.  You should enjoy it as well.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|It is normal for a series to start showing less promise by the fifth season.  Strangely enough, Castle seems to have avoided this curse by letting the plot more forward between the main characters.  The episodes so far have been a good balance of thrilling and sweet.  It is not necessarily high on realism, but it is definitely a good time.
B001NHJTKG|5.0|Dire Straits has their own sound and this is a good collection of them.  Enjoy them.  One of my favorite albums.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|we are using it on a Samsung galaxy 10&#34; tab and it works great. has a great selection of books.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Bad story line......<br />Bad acting....<br />Relied way to much on special effects....and slow motion.<br /><br />Recommend &#34;The Raid&#34; for a better action movie....<br /><br />D
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Best Mahjong I've downloaded...great graphics, no crashes, side story is cool, lots of different levels.  I got it for free but I'd pay 99 cents.  : )
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Package was received quickly and in perfect condition.<br />Movie is good overall. Great dogfight scenes. Period correct look. Only complaint, some of the acting is &#34;predictable&#34;, but again, it's still a great movie for the WWII buff.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pretty good movie. I like all the pixar films, and while I wouldnt say this is their best film, it rates pretty well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a really good series.  My family looks forward to watching it.  It is worth every penny.  Buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i loved this game and i love that it is 3d and i can interact with horse it is pretty cool keep up the good work
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it fun, if you want to have a horse i relly recomend this app<br />download it! its one of the few apps that is free completely

B000GCFG7E|4.0|I had a hard time putting the book down. I have read all of his books and looking forward for the next one.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Superb and quite addicting. Started watching it last week on Netflix after hearing so many people talking about it. Now I am on season 3. Its easy to watch and understand and I am thoroughly enjoying it. Looking at the other comments I am not the only one. A must watch show :) Enjoy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it its perfect for a horse person and who loves races and working with horses its addicting to me
B00992CF6W|4.0|I was trying to play with my friend but it did not work because we need the same wifi please fix

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this was awesome!  its so cool but if your time is up just delete it and buy it again.my friends play survival craft also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If I could I would give Downton Abbey 100 stars! O love this engaging series!! Thanks Masterpiece Theatre for another fantastic PBS series.  BRAVO!!
0689861141|5.0|The story is short so baby doesn't get bored. illustrations are cute and colorful. The book is sturdy so it can take a little beating.
098555780X|5.0|This book really is great, full color pictures that illustrate the actions well. There's no question what to do next when weaving. Besides its illustrated well, there are some really great ties in here. a must buy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm not completely done( 1/3 done)  the book but so far it's a little so starting. The back and forth of the main characters keeps you interested. I love the writing. I can't wait to see where this book takes me.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It was a fun read.  I prefer the TV show with Castle as the primary character, to the book about Heat.  A Castle fan will enjoy the novel to fill in references that pop up in the show.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Again for my friends daughter,she loves them and cheers when ever they are on for her.  I liked the price and how quickly they arrived!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Would have been a good story line but it got too serious and just wasn't as much fun as it could have been
B004VD3YIM|2.0|I use this with the wansview ipcam for a baby monitor.  I am viewing on a samsung galaxy s3, and so is my husband.  We constantly experience a loss of picture, about once a minute. The app also outright crashes very frequently.  Waste of money!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Get ready to get sucked into a real charmer.  There are enough characters to support the plot and make it very interesting but not so many that you loose interest.  The details were very vivid and the plot had plenty of twists and turns.  A realy page turner.  A cute romance novel that will make you laugh and cry and not want it to be over.  I bet this will be a movie someday.  I would definitely buy a ticket!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun and inventive and challenging.  The historical details are not always entirely accurate, but that does not matter so much.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A story with deep meaning, about our purpose in life and how all is connected. Written like a fable, of a boy on a great adventure to achieve his dream.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was interesting if slightly disorganized. Rick Riordan manages to capture all the main points of a great book:<br /><br />Love, Action, Drama, Comedy, and a sprinkle of Distrust.<br /><br />Can't wait for the last book!!!!
B00009W0U4|3.0|Purchsed this through an online recommendation.  It is hard to follow as it is written in revers order with each scene explaining the scene prior to it.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|2 out of three CD's in th ebox set were damaged, so when we sat down to watch it tonight, we were very dissappointed.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|LoveAdele 21.  LIsten to it all the time.  LOve that I can get it on my Kindle Fire.  Use it when traveling.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Athens Wraiths of Eden is fun but too short. The free levels are enough to get you addicted so you spend 2.99 on the rest. Then it's over in a day (even with the bonus level). Graphics are nice.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I ordered this cover for my Kindle Fire because the price was right.  The texture feels nice in my hands and the Kindle snapped in securely without any trouble whatsoever.  I've been using the cover for about a month now and it's holding up nicely. The cover is easy to hold folded over while I'm reading and it props the Kindle up nicely when watching videos or movies.  I give it 4 stars and not because of any particular flaw...only because the cover didn't come with a box of donuts and a free trip to Europe.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Couldnt put the book down... paints a picture in your mind :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)

B0007OCG56|4.0|I expected more humor than romance, but the plot is very realistic. My ESL students could identify themselves with the main character.
0316227706|5.0|I bought two books for gifts and my friends really enjoyed it. Wonderful, funny photos and this will make you smile.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Must be connected to the internet in order play. A little slow on the uptake but the games move along. Has a few problems, though... Freezes occasionally. Some features don't always show up... I have tournament mine. Can't figure out how to get that on the wife's tablet!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a good game for filling in the gaps when you're waiting for something to happen. On hold, doctor waiting room, etc.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Great app for sharing your desktop PC files with your tablet. This app allows you to bring your pc files with you on your tablet. Spring for the registered version and you have added functionality.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read almost everything that Stephen King has written, and I have to say with all honesty - this is the absolute best book written EVER by Stephen King.<br /><br />I've read through many of the reviews of this book and am surprised at how many people complained that it was too long, the story was too detailed, or that they just became bored. I completely disagree with all of them. This story was not too long - every part of it was necessary for a full, complete story. Obviously, these people either aren't familiar with Stephen King's style of writing or simply don't get it. Well, I get it - and I loved it!<br /><br />The detail that went into this novel is amazing. I can't imagine how many months (years?) of research it took for King to become so familiar with the real-life characters portrayed in this novel in order to do them, and the story, justice. And, although he even admits he fudged on a few details for the sake of the story - I felt like I learned so much more about the time period and the Kennedy assassination than I ever did in school, from history books, or even from the many television shows I've watched about it. This alone make this story truly amazing.<br /><br />After reading Bag of Bones, I already believed that Stephen King was a great literary fiction writer and not just a horror story novelist. Yet, this novel makes an even stronger case for King as a writer of literary fiction. Thank you, Stephen King, for letting me follow along with Jake on his journey through time. I had a blast!
B008N1V11U|4.0|A neat graphic adventure in the Batman universe. Works reasonably well. You don't know how to navigate as there's really no clear explanation of how to do this. You have to use the left side of the screen to do this. Once you figure it out, though, it's pretty cool. Can't really complain for the price paid.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Cute story but no surprises. Light and entertaining but the movie is really geared for the preteenager and not the general audience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great series, loved every single episode, it is a nice change from all the same mundane TV shows.  Downton Abbey great show.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We have had these before and they work great it is used every day we have a wood stove and always there is a little to sweep up
B009VB7QQA|2.0|This movie was very disappointing.  Glad I did not go to movies and waste ten bucks, not what I was expecting
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Mostly good. I don't like that it doesn't show you how to castle and that it doesn't show you which pieces have been taken. Otherwise very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the first page I read; I could not put it down!!! I absolutely recommend this book to any one who loves reading. I felt like I was in the story watching and feeling everything katnis was describing!!<br />Suzanne Collins is my new favorite author!
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Great story with a great screenplay brought to life by incredible performances. It's a raw honest look at a relationships and how they do and don't work at times.
B009FZFONO|3.0|The plot draws you in and the well played characters keep you on the edge of your seat. But the bloody gore, descriptive killing, and sex scenes are just  too much for prime time television. The same suspense can be achieved without such explicit  detail.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Enjoyed watching some of my favorite &#34;oldies&#34; together, entertaining, fast paced movie. A little more &#34;romance&#34; would of been nice.
076115678X|5.0|Being a psychology junkie, I tend to read books that focus on what's happening just below the scalp. So, when a co-worker handed me this hair-care handbook to borrow, I honesty wasn't so sure I was going to read it before returning it back to her.<br /><br />After I tucked the book away in my bag, I did take notice of just how healthy and controlled my co-worker's curly locks looked. As I ran my fingers through my own set of curly craziness, I thought that maybe--just maybe--this book could offer me some helpful tips too.<br /><br />A few days later, I picked up the book, and read it in one sitting. I'm not sure what was more surprising...how much I enjoyed the book, or how much useful (and often counter-intuitive) curl-aid it provided. The basic message of the approach is: ditch the shampoo, brushes, chemicals, and heat (aka: \\"blow fryers\\") and gain optimal curl condition, control, and confidence.<br /><br />Besides learning more about the care and feeding of curls, the book unexpectedly nourished my psych appetite too. Dispersed among its chapters on hair care and styling are its \\"Curl Confession\\" features where curly girls (and guys) share and explore the psychological challenges of growing up and thriving in a straight world. On top of that, as I read the book, I could not help but realize how hair care and acceptance can be metaphors for self care and acceptance.  In the words of the author:<br /><br />\\"Every day is a new day and you've just got to go with the flow. Accepting yourself as you are and letting go of what society says you should be are the first steps towards freeing yourself. Free your hair and the rest will follow.\\" (p. xi)<br /><br />How fun to be surprised with hair care tips that I didn't know I needed, plus an above-the-scalp approach that could be extended to the psych-going-ons below. Contrary to what I predicted, I'll be returning the (fully-read!) book to my co-worker with a new appreciation for my curls and approach to life.<br /><br />(And, if this Curly Girl approach works, when I return to my typical psych reads, I'll be doing so with a healthier set of curls topping the psych-junkie mindset--both of which I fully accept!)And, if this Curly Girl approach works, when I return to my typical psych reads, I'll be doing so with a healthier set of curls topping the psych-junkie mindset--both of which I fully accept!)
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I read this book as part of our pre-martial counseling and we still use the &#34;love languages&#34; today with each other to help us understand and respond to one another. But the advice also works for friends, coworkers, etc.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I'm a Clint Eastwood fan and I found this movie to be very enjoyable.  Although the script is simple and predictable, it is a good blend of Eastwood the man and Eastwood the actor.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I found this story to be refreshing near-future sci-fi, heavy on (plausible-sounding) science, with frequent comic relief. Don't expect masses of character development.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The writers on this show are incredible! The way they are able to re-work the stories of all the characters and weave them together and weave it together with the real world is amazing! This series is a WONDERFUL escape and a joy to watch!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I always loved this movie and Im really glad I have it on DVD finally. Wish it could have been bluray, but it doesnt take away from it!
B0081SPK0I|4.0|I love the original Final Freeway, and this version expands on that concept. Multiple paths to the finish keep this game interesting. Like the original, this is California Cruisin' for your smartphone. Great retro game.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I always loved this movie and Im really glad I have it on DVD finally. Wish it could have been bluray, but it doesnt take away from it! Miyazaki is the man!!
B006O3MU96|4.0|Doodle Jump is the quintessential smartphone game, and this Christmas edition offers up some seasonal themes to this simplest of games. Get used to the shooting, it's lobbing snowballs instead of direct fire.
B000025WN5|1.0|If you're familiar with Knopfler's movie soundtrack work you feel his presence in the layered ambience reflective of his solo commercial albums. Mark plays guitar somewhere on track five, but i guess I missed it. It's his music performed by a chamber orchestra, but you would never fathom he had anything to do with this. i love almost everything Mark Knopfler has done, from Dire Straits to his solo work, but pass on this. Finding him on this is like playing &#34;Where's Waldo?&#34;.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a great flight simulator game for mobile devices. Great graphics and challenging action. Controls are easy enough to use, but it takes some time to develop the skills needed to land, especially on a carrier. Just when you think you have it mastered, set the options to wind and rain. Ghost Rider requesting a flyby...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding in every way! This series transports me to another place and time. The actors have all been perfectly cast.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Always enjoy Nicholas Sparks.  This, as his others has interesting characters and is easy to pick up anytime to read a few pages or read in one rainy day!  Always a bit of mystery in his novels which keeps the reader intriqued.  Have read most of his books, not one I didn't enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't wait for the movies to come out...it will be spectacular...let the games begin and may the odds forever be in your favor...
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I know the book is a Y.A. Read but I usually enjoy the nostalgia that comes along with a coming of age novel, that is what I expected to find in The Perks of being a Wallflower. The voice of Charlie seemed unusally young, like that of maybe a 11 year old. His perception of things around him seemed slightly off to me. Maybe it's the circumstances that suround Charlies emotional trama, or the fact that I'm 26. Either way the book to me was kinda uneventful and slow. My reaction is just \\"meh\\".
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|My son was very happy that I bought him this as a gift.  The only problem I had was that the collectible box that came with it was broken.  I'm sure I could have sent it in for a replacement but the videos were good and I'm really busy so going to the post office just wasn't in my schedule.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a officially a sparks fan now! I could not put this book down. I loved the suspense and the love story. I definitely recommend this book
B005IQZB14|4.0|A fun read,especially for those of us who are hikers,know California and Oregon, and for women interested in the stories of other women trying to figure their lives out.
B008476HBM|4.0|The story line is good but the writing style takes a little getting used to.  Jane Austen writes in long complicated sentence structures that sometime required me to reread a time or two to understand.  I consider it a good mental exercise for my aging brain.  I will continue to read her works.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Would recommend to others! The mixer was just as described and came quickly.  No problems with any of the service

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my all time favorite book. It was even better than the first two. I hope she writes another one
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic mini-series.  Good acting, engaging story...bad guys are played very well.  You never know what is coming next.  Can't wait for the next season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this one, I think it's better than the first. I wish there were more books like this
B0047VSW30|4.0|This movie captures a time in history that is often over simplified. How many of us today know how well educated women could be during that time. Spend a weekend with Hypatia and Cleopatra and you'll see the world in a far different way.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Husband heard about this dog and told me to find the movie so he could watch it.  Let me tell you, it is a good movie, and a real tear jerker!  It is amazing what powers a dog can have!  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good cry!
B000002UAF|5.0|Having conquered the charts all over the world, The Beatles next project was a movie. 'A Hard Day's Night' was made in the Spring of 1964 and released in July of that year. Accompanying it was an album with the songs from the movie on it. However, the UK album was very different from that released in the US. In the US the distributors went for a soundtrack album, with the 7 tracks from the film plus 'I'll Cry Instead', which was originally intended to be in the movie but ultimately left out, together with 4 George Martin instrumentals based on Lennon & McCartney songs. In the UK The Beatles and George Martin opted for a conventional studio album, with 5 Lennon & McCartney compositions replacing the instrumentals. This is the UK version, which was chosen as the CD release.<br /><br />This was the first all-original Beatles album and remained the only album with all Lennon & McCartney songs. The individual songs are wonderful; although this is a less rock-and-roll oriented album than the first two, the tunefulness and musicality of the numbers is much increased. The songs range from the uptempo title song to the ballad 'And I Love Her', McCartney's first recorded ballad and many would say one of his best. The other songs include the beautiful harmonies of 'If I Fell', the driving beat of 'You Can't Do That', the melodic and lyrical loveliness of 'Things We Said Today', the interesting and understated 'I'll Be Back' and of course 'Can't Buy Me Love', the #1 single at the time The Beatles had the top 5 singles in the US charts and 14 singles in the top 100.<br /><br />There isn't a weak song on the album and every one has been played regularly on the radio so that all are familiar and well-loved. However, the album as a whole is not generally ranked as among the top tier of Beatles albums and currently sits at 307th in the Rolling Stone list of the 500 best albums of all time. It's far below 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Revolver', 'Rubber Soul', 'White Album' and 'Abbey Road', all of which are in the top 14. Why should this be? I think there are several reasons.<br /><br />First, although all the songs are listed as by Lennon & McCartney, the album is dominated by Lennon songs. 10 of the 13 are his and although all McCartney's songs are strong ('Can't Buy Me Love', 'And I Love Her' and 'Things We Said Today'), the balance is missing. More than any other album this comes across as primarily the work of one Beatle. Great though the Lennon songs are, the album needs more variety.<br /><br />Second, Harrison and Starr are relegated to minor roles. Harrison sings on only one song, Starr on none and George doesn't contribute as a songwriter (at this point in his career he said frankly that he would rather leave it to John and Paul). On the group's great albums Harrison and Starr, although always the junior partners, were more prominent and their contributions lifted the later records.<br /><br />Third, the songs themselves were more one-dimensional in that they were more pop-oriented, less edgy and more mid-tempo than either previous or future albums. There's no 'Twist And Shout' or 'Money' here and likewise the band hadn't developed the sophistication and innovation they would show on, say, 'Revolver'. John's 'I'll Be Back' is a good example; it's a wonderful song but low-key and not instantly ear-catching.<br /><br />Finally, the album as a whole is less than the sum of its parts. While each song, listened to on its own, is memorable, taken together they just don't make a cohesive album. The end result is that I find myself going through the album saying \\"I like that song\\" to each song but not saying at the end \\"I love that album\\". At this point in their careers (don't forget, their ages ranged from Ringo's 23 to George's 21 when this album was recorded) they hadn't quite mastered the structuring of an album in the way they did with their later works.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's an album full of great songs and no lover of great pop music shouldbe without it.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has brought together the forces that shaped the world's nations for WW 2.  Each chapter brings the reader information and insight into the  dynamics that created the stage for international conflict.  Each leading character and the decisions each made are brought to life in all their various personalities.  Supporting characters, the men, women, and children, of each nation are entwined with events that flow in and through each life and make the entire story alive in all it's slices of humanity and inhumanity.  Follett is a splendid read.

B003V56MXK|1.0|Description of album was in &#34;very good shape with some wear to the cover.  Album was dirty, had a scratch through song 1 side 1 and was so worn it was unplayable due to scratching sound overpowering the music ( note I am not that picky I own 100's of vinyl albums)  I did get a full refund, so thank you for standing behind the item.

B007HACDLK|5.0|[[ASIN:0857208748 Last Man]]Love these Vince Flynn books but there sure are a lot of typographical and grammatical errors in this book.  Seems like they did a real rush job and did not properly edit the Kindle version.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have in my kindle fire. It is very fun and addictive to play. And for people who say it's not &quot;free&quot; it is unless you chose to pay for extra stuff which isn't necessary for the game. So I would recommend people to get this game
B001JIFYSA|1.0|We were unable to watch this movie because of password problems.  The process for resetting one's password is too difficult, especially when there's a party going on.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Make no doubt about it this is not Monopoly or Risk. Settlers of Catan is a very engaging game and while it is turn based everyone needs to pay attention to every turn and often participates which keeps the attention from wandering.<br /><br />There are all kinds of expansions which add new twists but the basic 4 player game is still my favorite. The expansion to make it playable by 5-6 is nice too but the play definitely changes and requires a different strategy.
B007P6VM04|4.0|I enjoy some of the cover songs mixed with show tunes. Would prefer to hear more of Katherine McPhee though
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Another good Clint Eastwood classic. Great sports movie too. Same stubborn old man trying to hang on to the past but with a moral to the story. Entertaining and easy to like.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|What more can I say? Less is more. The movie reflects the often slow pace of our everyday lives while entwining our need for an emotional connection.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|I've pretty much loved everything Aimee Mann has done since launching her solo career, starting with 1993's captivating WHATEVER and continuing through 2008's strong @#%&$! SMILERS. (2005's brilliant concept album, THE FORGOTTEN ARM, was particularly impressive).<br />  However, after SMILERS, there was no denying that a ....sameness....had started to creep into Mann's music. That's why it was cool to hear that she was going to shake things up on her next release, revisiting the 80's pop energy and sheen of, among others, The Cars.<br />  Was she successful? Well, yes...and no. This certainly is the most Til Tuesday-esque album Mann has made since...well, Til Tuesday!...but I wish that she had taken it even further. There are so many strong moments here that could have been built upon and expanded on.....good ~ very good! ~ but I expect great from Aimee Mann!<br />  Things start strong with the lilting title track. Mann's knowing lead vocal is expertly anchored by the spirited arrangement, allowing the classic Mann lyrics to just jump out at you. Whether light (\\"When you're a charmer/The apples fall/And you're quite the little collector/You got 'em all\\") or dark (\\"When you're a charmer/People respond/They can't see the hidden agenda/You got going on\\"), this is what Mann is all about! A great way to kick things off.<br />  Equally strong is the mesmerizing \\"Disappeared.\\" A hypnotic lead vocal wraps around the crushing lyrics (\\"But now I join the queue/Of people dead to you/The one-time chosen few\\"), resulting in a performance that is both wistful and chilling. Add the contrast of a muted, almost light and airy, arrangement and you have a track where everything just comes together in spot-on perfection.<br />  \\"Labrador\\" bounds along like it's titular pup, goofy and gangly, but masking a much darker undercurrent. A knowing nod to a friend and/or lover who has begun to see someone as less than an equal ~ or even human ~ Mann acknowledges the fact that we often choose to put ourselves in this position (\\"'Cause I came back for more\\"). Few artists can make pain sound so sweet.<br />  Up next is my favorite cut off of CHARMER, a slice of pop perfection entitled \\"Crazytown.\\" A shimmering arrangement, cushioned by pristine instrumentation, brilliantly backs Mann's seductive lead vocal. However, once again, it's the lyrics that are the true stars here: \\"A girl who lives in crazytown/Where craziness gets handed down/Who? Whoever's gonna volunteer/Will only end up living here.\\" An absolute gem.<br />  The stunning blend of light and dark continues with \\"Soon Enough.\\" The soaring arrangement, complete with some blistering guitar riffs (courtesy of Jamie Edwards), is an odd, yet seductive, contrast to the withering lyrics (\\"'Cause what's more fun/Than other people's hell\\"). But, as with 99.9% of Mann's output, it works. Yet another winner!<br />  The winning streak continues with \\"Living A Lie.\\" Mann very rarely duets with anyone, but her pairing here with James Mercer of The Shins is lovely. If you didn't know better, you would swear this was a cover of classic by, oh, I don't know, Badfinger or Squeeze. I just wish it had gone a little bit longer, building in intensity. (But I do love \\"Creating for you a persona or two/Or an out-and-out mythology\\"). Very nice.<br />  Up next is another favorite, \\"Slip And Roll.\\" I don't know if this gorgeous cut was left over from the FORGOTTEN ARM sessions or newly written for the (aborted) musical version that Mann had been working on, but it's all good....the lyrics are sheer poetry, the arrangement is haunting and the lead vocal is warm and enticing. However, much like with \\"Living A Lie\\", it ends WAY too soon....this song should have gone on for at least another 60 to 90 seconds.<br />  It's at this point that things start to slump just a bit, resulting in a four star album that could have been a fiver. \\"Gumby\\" is a nice enough cut ~ good melody, smooth vocal ~ but it's nothing that we haven't heardbefore, both here and on previous albums, and to better effect. Mann is too talented to be filling in space by repeating herself. A rare miss.<br />  \\"Gamma Ray\\" is the disc's edgiest cut, but there's a rushed quality to the track that ultimately sinks it. It's as if Mann is forcing herself to wrap things up in under three minutes. Also, I would have liked to have heard more anger and bite in the vocal...when you're singing \\"You build bombs/You're familiar with explosions\\", light and sweet just doesn't always work. Good...could have been great.<br />  \\"Barfly\\" may have also been an outtake from THE FORGOTTEN ARM, but it doesn't work nearly as well here as \\"Slip And Roll.\\" The instrumentation is tight, with some particularly nice guitar from Chris Bruse, but the arrangement boarders on plodding, while Mann's vocal is lazy and uninspired. Another rare miss.<br />  Things wrap up with \\"Red Flag Diver.\\" If there had been a little more meat on this song's bones, or if it had followed a stronger cut, this one would have been a winner. As is, it's just...O.K.<br />  And \\"O.K.\\" from Aimee Mann just ISN'T O.K....she's too talented for that! (On another note...the artwork. In the past, Mann has hit it out of the park with her packaging, but CHARMER's is so busy and distracting that it actually detracts from the overall vibe vs. adds to it. I would have MUCH prefered the \\"red dress\\" promo shot as the cover....now THAT would have been a charmer!).<br />  So, c'mon, Aimee...continue to step out of the box....longer songs, a little bit more edge, continued quirk...in other words, we want to be charmed even more! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).before, both here and on previous albums, and to better effect.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Larsson builds upon the previous books to create another gripping tale of Lizbeth Salander and the Millennium. Sadly, it's the last book in the series.

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Don't waste any previous life on this movie.  $1 rental - maybe. Some snappy lines but not enough to sustain the potty mouth and humor.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great stories, characters and visual effects. Hard to pick a favorite character but I think Rumpelstiltskin and Regina the Evil Queen are most engaging. I hope this series runs a long time.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very fun game. I enjoy playing its fun playing activities with my hourse. every girl should have this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It definitely keeps you entertained. I have spent cash on this, but I haven't had any problems like the others are describing.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great album! I would definitely gift this to a friend. Some of the lyrics are not appropriate for young ears but that's only if they understand what's being sang.

B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is a great game with fun ideas for how to make the sick animals feel better. It's one of the games my oldest niece who is 3 invariably asks to play since I first introduced her to it. (It can also be fun for the grown ups.)
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|I saved my money to buy a boss shotgun but the crappy game didn't save the purchase. that's my only complaint
B008QMMEOE|2.0|It's too simple and doesn't have enough variety to keep a toddler engaged for more than a few minutes. If I purchase a game I want some serious entertainment value in it.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Once again, Muse proves they are capable of pushing the boundaries of what mainstream rock can accomplish with their newest album. Yes, there are songs that test some diehard Muse fans on whether they can stand the new direction they have taken with The 2nd Law. But deep down, there is the depth and beauty many of us long-time listeners have grown accustomed to hearing in their music. Conceptually, it is satisfying. Musically, it is interesting.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, as always, Trust In Muse.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is beautifully filmed, develops the characters with depth, reflects historical knowledge, and is an intelligent program. A true classic!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is just amazing. The only thing I hate is that it tries to make you buy gems and food.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is beautiful, sweet, tragic, funny and just plain amazing! The story of Holden and Sky will break your heart but you'll love every word you read. I loved this book. I do highly recommend it to anyone either YA or adult. Mrs. Hoover I can not wait to see what you come up with next!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Well written. Unique subject matter.  Shades of sadness with a happy ending.  I once belonged to an women's organization that installed it's officers with a flower ceremony.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|Marvel's The Avengers(2012) is a fun, action packed superhero movie. It was retitled Marvel's Avengers Assemble in the UK. People have already made jokes about John Steed and Emma Peel of \\"The Avengers\\" not being in this film. The film is directed and co-written by Joss Whedon(Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly). The movie cost $220 million and took years to make. It made more than $1 billion at the box office and received some good reviews. The plot is not too complex. Superheroes Nick Fury, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, The Black Widow, and Hawkeye have to stop an alien invasion. The film is colorful, photogenic, and fast paced. There's plenty of robust heroics and humor. The Incredible Hulk beats up bad guy Loki in one scene and calls him a \\"puny god\\"! The music score by Alan Silvestri is good. The Avengers did receive some bad reviews. Someone claims it felt like \\"bad fan fiction\\"! Whatever! Marvel's The Avengers is just as fun as 1978's Superman the Movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|AMAZING! I personally like the 3rd book better, but this one was still amazing! it took me a whole day to finish it, i couldnt put it down
B006LSZECO|5.0|A clever page turner with highly developed plot and characters.  Make sure you have some time to read it once you start-- hard to put down!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|all i can say is AHHHHH! i can not wait for the movie(if they still go through with it!)  I'm hooked!
B0095XPZBC|4.0|I found out that the Blu Ray restoration for the even numbered series is being farmed out to another company, I'm not sure if this explains the drop in picture quality compared to season 1 (which looked brilliant).  However in quite a few episodes there is some very noticeable grain in the picture (these aren't even low light scenes).  However, this is still the best that ST TNG has ever looked, you'll notice the sets have improved (in series 1, just look at the floor, you'll notice dirty carpets, carpets that are cut badly or loose on the floor), also the actors seem a lot more comfortable working opposite eachother.  Having said that, the departure of Gates McFadden is pretty glaring and the inclusion of Dr Pulaski..... frankly she comes across as a bit of a.............  well.. fill in your own words there.  There seems to be a bit more humor here even in the more serious toned episodes and it was nice to have the option of watching the full version of &#34;Measure Of A Man&#34;.  Some of the extra's are compiled mainly of interviews, such as the extra about the restoration of Season 2 that's mainly interviews without any &#34;Before & After&#34; comparison footage and only a bit of footage about using CGI to enhance the look of the borg ship.  Again, unknown if this is because this season was farmed out to a different company and no one bothered to work on the extra's.  Still, the reunion interview with some of the cast is good.  The original Season 2 Promo has to be seen to be believed (it's really tacky and badly done, I'm surprised anyone tuned in to watch the series when that aired), still, it's good to see the difference between the Video broadcast and what you see in the blu ray.  Shame about the picture quality being so grainy in a some scenes, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game when I need to boost my confidence. I always win! So, the only criticism I have is that it is sometimes too easy.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|What an incredible band.  There is such variety on this album, it will take me a long while to get anywhere near sick of it.  Great music of great quality.
1416583432|4.0|So many interesting things about dogs. Even a non dog owner would enjoy this book.<br />She seems to have a great love and empathy for dogs. Mixing the science with a<br />sense of humor makes it a very pleasant read.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This was a sweet little movie with characters I could totally relate to. The dialogue was exceptionally witty...so witty that my husband didn't get a lot of it -- haha! I think it would be ok for most kids over say 9, except for 2 things -- a brief boys hand on girls bra, and giving a kid a slug of beer in his milk glass. After the milk was poured out, of course.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|It just wasn't what I like. I can't really put my finger on what I didn't like about it, just that I had an overwhelming urge to turn it off almost from the beginning...
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Timothy Ferriss is an inspriational and bold author. Always willing to face the unknown and experiment to find results, he is dedicated to living life!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great characters, unpredictable, and original! I couldn't wait to read the final 2 in the series! I definitely recommend it!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Absoulutley a great series. Love it!!! It is a great bond between mother and daughter. It's uplifting. I love how each charactor talks in there conversations, fast and funny. Its not just a show for women, its a show for everyone.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I like the movie, fun to watch story id goof. This is not a serious movie just a feel good one
1401322786|2.0|I had read several of Mitch Albom's novels and found them to be poignant and thought-provoking.  Unfortunately, I found this one to be quite muddled.  I struggled through it trusting that the ending would make it worthwhile but was disappointed.  I found the ending contrived and simplistic.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Really enjoyed how the story evolved around the character. Has all the elements of action, romance and suspense. Can't wait to see the movie.
B004NS710C|4.0|Unstoppable is a fast-paced, exciting movie with plenty of action and good characters.  You'll have a hard time deciding when to go refill your popcorn.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game but I do not like the ads.  However, the quality of the free game convinced me to pay for the other games.
B003LXSY60|5.0|One of my favorite albums by the Black Keys.  All their music is great - and you can't beat the price!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app.  I love Pinterest and this app works perfectly. Sometimes apps don't give you all the features that the website does but this app does.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Love the Black Keys.  Hard to say anything bad about their music - but this is not my favorite album.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It has been a long time since I have enjoyed watching and then waiting for the next episode.<br />I watched  season 2 and 3 in two days because Showtime had a free weekend. I am so happy that I will get to see it from the beginning
B001GXF2YY|5.0|The Bosch series has always been a good read and Angel's Flight did not disappoint.  Lots of great angles that will add to the enjoyment.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|There has been a suspicion of late that the last few book &#34;written by&#34; Tom Clancy are more the work of colaborators than the man himself. Threat Vector is a return to his best work and it was an excellent read. Clancy seems remarkebly well informed on military / security issues and you can only suspect he has particularly well placed sources.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Good book and continued story, but not as good as first book.  Will most likely buy book 3 to complete trilogy.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|For a person who has written so many books in the same genre it is remarkable he has maintained his standards. I would even suggest his work is getting better. The Racketeer is quite complex but is written in such a way the premise is believable and exciting. Congratulations John Grisham

I'm upset because I was able to travel to her town before and collect hearts but now I don't know if the game has a glich because it doesn't let me go to her town anymore. hopefully Gameloft will rectify this matter. Other than the game is AWESOME.

0765325950|5.0|I have read many negative reviews written by readers of A Memory of Light, the final book of The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, and I find myself laughing as I read them.  Most of the reviews appear to be written by self proclaimed perfectionists who love to hear themselves talk.  But what the heck, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Right?  I just wish that everyone could have experienced the joy, wonder, amazement and appreciation I felt with every word written throughout the entire Wheel of Time series.  Robert Jordan has been a literary part of my life since 1990.  I feel sad now that it is over.  I have to admit, I treated every page of A Memory Of Light as if it were a last meal.  I simply didn't want it to end.<br />I would highly recommend the Wheel Of Time books to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.  I would also recommend the books to those who enjoy a good story with good solid characters that one can identify with.  My heart and thanks go out to the author, Robert Jordan, who unfortunately passed way in September of 2007.It saddens me that he was not able to see his dream, his creation, his story, completed and in the hands of readers.  The fact that he cared enough, both about his work and his readers, to ensure that his story was completed, speaks volumes about the man's character and integrity.<br />Kudos to Jordan's widow and author Brandon Sanderson for taking on a monumental task and completing a marathon that Jordan was unable to.<br />Good vs Evil.  Light vs Dark.  The Wheel Of Time turns and a new age begins.
B000HZGBLA|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Again I am a HUGE FAN OF ANGELINA JOLIE-PITT so WHAT MORE CAN I SAY !
B0000004F9|5.0|A line up of remarkable people create remarkable music. The Canterbury scene at its finest. Early 'Softs and Floyd define what was to come in great British music.
B00A2GQIHG|5.0|I have almost all of her earlier recordings so it was a great buy to get this album. 10 of my friends have purchased this album.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Loved the fact that I could get a DVD which enriches knowing about the artist.  The songs on this track are superb!  I first saw Rufus Wainwright on CBS Sunday Morning and was intrigued.  Then I saw an hour performance on Artist's Den.  This made me decide to get his recent music.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|LOve her in this and basically in any of her work. I purchased Tomb Raider one and two, the Tourist Wanted. what can I say I'm a HUGE FAN OF ANGELINA JOLIE-PITT
B004SBQALA|4.0|When I first began the movie, it looked like an attempt to appeal to the \\"Twilight\\" fans.  But, after I saw who his protector was I decided to give it a chance a little longer.  I'm glad I did.  The movie had a good story.  The characters were believable.  Unknown actors, as far as I can tell, with the exception of the protector who came out in \\"Hitman\\", and the mother of the teenage girl the main character falls in love with.  You might recognize her in the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Movie.<br /><br />The action is sparse, though, until the end.  There were some very unexpected surprises.  Although I don't know why a certain \\"animal\\" accompanies him.  This is a question for me.  But, the special effects were cool.  The movie itself on Blu Ray is BEAUTIFUL.  The quality, the colors, everything was just clear.  The sound was very good.  Great separation between speakers.  When it rained, you can hear it very clearly behind you.  Any other sounds that surround you immersed you in the story.  Very great job of mixing the sound and engineering.<br /><br />At the end when I saw the credits and saw Michael Bay's name, I understood why it looked so great.  Being that he did the Transformers.<br /><br />I do recommend seeing this movie.  To add to your collection...maybe not.  But, if you are a fan of Sci-Fi, aliens, action, etc., you may want to add it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The app is very similar to the iPhone app. It's easy to use. I like shopping from eBay so it's great for me.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|kids love it. a reward game when homework is done. Kids compare completion with each other. will recommend to everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i'm a weather 'geek' &amp; just luv this app..the radar is spot on, along w/the ability to zoom in as close to your area as you want. also luv the 10 day forecasting..another interesting feature is the 'HEALTH,  OUTDOORS'...sections that gives you an idea if your Arthritis or Migraines are likely to flare up - i have both &amp; it's nice to know what to expect. it even lists things like HAIR FRIZZ RISK (!), MISQUITO RISKS, KITE FLYING, DOG WALKING, BEACH GOING, BARBEQUEING, TRAVELING, &amp; many others that are quite interesting &amp; even funny!<br /><br />&amp; Btw, the radar is crisp &amp; clear w/the ability to move it anywhere in the world - great for travelers.<br /><br />Others have mentioned that there's no way to close the app..why bother? It doesn't slow down your device in any way &amp; it saves time opening it if a sudden storm approaches. I like that it's always running in the background, imho...<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to keep an eye on the weather..  ;-)
B0067QPVD2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The story was kind of the same but I still enjoyed the whole film.<br />I recommend this to a horror movie buff.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I have seen this movie several times I got all the x- men movies for my grandson. He is 16 , he says this one is his favorite.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I would recommend this movie to a friend. Lots of hot cars and hot women. Lots of action scenes.<br />I liked The Rock and Vin Diesel going at it. Very entertaining.
0739375970|1.0|The accent is just wretched.  He makes too many voices like pathetic old men.  They all sound the same.  They sound like they are going to croak any second.
B004OR199G|4.0|Kris is a real inspiration.  Her personal experience adds a depth to the book that others lack. Her upbeat style and outlook helps make healthy eating even more fun.
1439153663|5.0|If you liked The Help you will LOVE this book.  A little slow to start but a real page turner.  Fascinating !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun and exciting. great for horse lover's.<br />5 stars. clean graphics. keeps you busy and entertained for hours. I love it and its really cool.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|Sweet. That's how I'd describe Anna and the French Kiss. This book was sweet, idealistic but unfortunately a little squeaky clean for me.<br /><br />I love Anna and St. Clair, and their story was adorable. But I felt like, the whole time, I was waiting for things to heat up. There was such a fantastic potential for building sexual chemistry and intense frustration, but, I think, the most physical they got, until the very end, was the touching of legs in the cinema... I know not everybody likes sexual frustration in a book, but I do, and for me, this was a gaping hole in Anna and &Eacute;tienne's story.<br /><br />'We're both aware that he knows everything about Parisian life, whereas I have he savvy of a chocolate croissant.'<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was a very cute book. I did really enjoy it. As a Brit myself, I loved &Eacute;tienne's `Britisms' and Anna's reactions. Yes, I say trousers, pants and s***e! I don't find them remotely amusing, so I find it totally amusing that an American thinks that's funny! It had me LOL'ing on many occaisions and was a great light hearted read.<br /><br />The surrounding characters played a huge part. Meredith was fab and I enjoyed the typical high school dynamics... the stereotypes; the snobby popular girl, the douche bag jock, etc. I love a good frienship group within a story... great one liners, canteen dramatics, witty interactions and the mandatory all-knowing sense-talking mutual friends. The dynamics of Anna's SOAP friendship group is no exception.<br /><br />'The grapes are smaller than I'm used to, and the skin is slightly textured. Is that dirt? I dip my napkin in water and dab at the tiny purple globes. It helps, but they're still sort of rough. Hmm. St. Clair and Meredith stop talking. I glance up to find them staring at me in matching bemusement.<br />\\"What?\\"<br />\\"Nothing,\\" he says. \\"Continue your grape bath.\\"'<br /><br />St. Clair and Anna's relationship was totally charming. I loved seeing their connection develop and their `friendship' form. How could she not fall for St. Clair? He was soooo adorable, taking her to romantic places, making her feel welcome... agh, love him and all his posh English gentleman-ness!<br /><br />'POINT Z&Eacute;RO DEC ROUTES DE FRANCE<br />\\"Mademoiselle Oliphant. It translates to `Point zero of the roads of France.' In other words, it's the point from which all other distances in France are measured. It's the beginning of everything. Welcome to Paris, Anna. I'm glad you've come.\\"'<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this was a lovely story. A very `vanilla', innocent, love story. For mepersonally, there wasn't enough steam, where I think there was super-steam-potential!! Stolen touches, whispered secrets, subtle flirting... this story lent itself to all of that. But if that doesn't bother you, Anna and the French Kiss is totally adorable and hilariously funny.<br /><br />'\\"If you ask me to kiss you, I will,\\" he says.<br />His fingers stroke the inside of my wrists, and I burst into flames.<br />\\"Kiss me,\\" I say.<br />He does.'<br /><br />By Smitten's Book BlogClair?

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Apart from the numerous sex scenes, after reading the series, I am left to wonder, would I stay with a man with so much baggage? Its not about the outward but soooo much about looking at the inward man/woman. Christian Grey is a fictional character but at some point, we all have met one or two in our lives who have deep issues that need to mend. But how many of us would actually take the time too get to know them or maybe help. It doesn't need to be love at first sight but more compassion and hey....always be true to yourself.
030758836X|3.0|Review by Donn G. Ziebell, Ph.D., Never kicked by a horse nor a mule, and author of the non-fiction Amazon book, \\"My Letters to a Prisoner -- I had not met\\". Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years.<br /><br />I thought I was going to be a goner with the trail of dissatisfaction Amy and Nick had within their marriage. It had more dents than a nice car slammed with a sledgehammer hundreds of times. Good times peaked though at moments but family wealth and good actions could not be maintained. Plus the wife's parents were wealthy authors of a running editions of a children's book series. Their main character in their books was named Amy, was their daughter. Happy little miss nice in the children's books was not mirrored in their flesh and blood daughter Amy.<br /><br />Amy planned an annual love, treasure hunt for Nick as her way to celebrate their anniversary. But Nick was derailed on the day of their 5th anniversary; Amy disappeared. Kidnapped or killed? Here the author's foot hits the accelerator and the story runs very fast, making me wake up at 3:00am to read until I tire and fall back to asleep again. Warped words and actions by both Nick and Amy kept me on the move. My run with my projected guesses were all denied substantiation. Who is becoming irrational, more mad, or extreme, me or the characters in this book? Well won't you be surprised!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although the ending was not what I expected, I very much enjoyed the series. Looking forward to how it will be portrayed on big screen but good read!
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is great,so handy, and works so well! I have no idea why I waited so long to get something like this. First, the price can't be beat, and second it holds two cups (insulated), a small pocket for keys and a wallet and a larger compartment for gloves, phone, extra snacks.... It doesn't get I'm the way of my hands or the hand brake. Great job!<br /><br />I should mention that I have a Baby Jogger Summit XC.
B0038BBA4I|3.0|I bought the Babel album before this one and in comparison Babel is much better, But you aren't going to love every song a band comes out with all of the time.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Love love love this album! I bought it at first as a CD from Starbucks and then proceeded to play it nonstop whenever I was in the car. I lost the CD and happily paid for it again as an MP3. Sooooooo good!
B008OOYALE|5.0|You should definitely get this game. it's great. It you like dragons then you should definitely get it. Best game ever
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|If you haven't seen Season 1 of American Horror Story, don't bother watching this and just go watch that instead.<br />If you have seen Season 1 of American Horror Story, you'll probably like this season, but not as much as Season 1.
0399157565|4.0|Though I have enjoyed Cornwell's recent titles, this is the first Scarpetta book that brought us back to the essence of her core characters.  With enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes, I'm definitely excited to see what she's cooking up for her next novel.
B00797MB0O|2.0|This movie was a waste of Charlize's talent.  It had a cute storyline which could have been so much better but it went no where fast.  The scene with her and the fat guy doing it was gross and unbelievable.  The ending was flat - as if the movie maker also just wanted it to be over.  So glad this was a free rental.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#60;3 &#60;3 it!  Great book, I was very pleased and couldn't put it down! Told my SIL about it right away and she loved it too!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|As clich&eacute; as it sounds I couldn't put this book down. After completing each chapter I couldn't help but continue. I never wanted this book to end, I was too captivated by their stories. It has a narrative that has stayed with me for days now.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|I love every song on this album. I miss her old classics like \\"if you had my love\\" and \\"waiting for tonight\\".
B005EVVPUE|5.0|I have all the available Queen concert DVDs but I think this is the greatest.  So complete and just a joy to watch Freddie, Brian, Roger and John.  If life was perfect, we would still have them creating and performing.  But we have to settle for what we have and enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|If anything this is so good I would waste $20 on it :)  always is would be better with armor but awsome
B009DH371K|5.0|Saw this at the theater with 4 other people (I guess Queen isn't the draw in Eau Claire, Wisconsin).  Couldn't wait to own the DVD so I could enjoy it again and again.  Although I like the Wembly performance better, the sound is better on some of the songs.  Besides, any performance of Queen is great and love.  Thank goodness we had Freddie!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This set is awesome, I love the all the extras. The picture and sound quality are superior. MUTHER mode makes &#34;an Alien marathon&#34; a breeze.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The free version is pretty short so I decided to buy the full version. It was well worth the money. Great storyline, long and entertaining. The puzzles are just hard enough to make you think but still figure out.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I couldn't put it down once I started it. Very cute, romantic, quick and easy read. Would recommend it anyone!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Read. This. For. Your. Answer. yeah it costs 7 bucks but so what. This is awesomely awesome  awesomeness!!! When I first got this I wasn't sure if I would like it but EVERYONE in my class played it! So I tried it out and loved it! Oh and get this, on the computer minecraft costs 30 bucks!!!!!! Yeah that's a lot... so if you like to make houses fight zombies and swim then GET THIS GAME .... lol .... anyway creative is for peaceful and easy things. It comes with all the items. Mostly anyway. Survival is for  fighting zombies spiders err and I think tame wild wolves. Just stop reading and get the game please. =)
1742677495|5.0|I really enjoy the reader she is perfect with the accents and she really puts you in the story with her reading it, and I plan on getting the rest of the set on cd also so I can listen to them going to and from work,
B009UX2YAC|4.0|you should get this game because it is fun to play and challenging this game is so cool I play it a lot get this app
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|I watched this film at Sundance and then again at Tribeca after it had won the Teddy Award at Berlin. I think the film is superbly done, and it approaches a relationship without judging its characters. It is also extremely well acted, and the lensing is fantastic, with a grainy beauty and a cinematography that reflects the 10 year journey the characters go through.<br /><br />Great Film,<br />Highly Recommend it.
B009VL299E|5.0|awesome as always!!!! killer dvd!! metallicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!! greetings from greece!!! hope to see those guys soon performing in our country!! cheers!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Fun read. Good mysterute at kept you reading it. But the ending was quite a disappointment......should have promised a sequel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game but it could use some work. I think there should be an option on what horse you start with.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|A perfect &#34;feel good&#34; movie for this year's Christmas gathering when supper was taking longer than planned, and the natives were getting restless.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|i really could not stop reading this book- let all of my tv shows go and will catch them on demand- really like the way he writes
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this show! I'm waiting to watch season 2 but you don't have it available yet..why? iTunes has it but it is waay overpriced!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|With this book S.K. is back to great storytelling and little preaching. If you did not like  the toon characters he used in Under the Dome -the mayor comes to mind who is a 'Christian' and meth-cooker at the same time comes to mind-, and miss his earlier writing style, you will like this. Is no IT or The Stand, how can it be as this is an alternate history book and not a horror book, yet is nevertheless worth your time. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this next part of the story of Ana and Christian, hard to put down.  Can't wait to read the next book!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Impressive knife, definitely provides a &#34;wow&#34; factor from everone who sees it.  Sharp, tough, and very capable blade.  Will put it to the test later this season.
1455502758|5.0|This was a very quick read - honest and sad but not depressing. Anyone could benefit from reading this book. Some of us will find ourselves in this position one day - others have people we love in the midst of it. This book provides an understanding of this march toward death on which we all eventually travel.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I bought this book having enjoyed her childrens books (Harry Potter series). I feel that she has not crossed over well to writing adult novels. It felt disjointed and not an enjoyable read.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game deleted all my coins every time I left the game and I had like fourty thousand coins don't get this app
B0093LINVK|2.0|Here's the good and the bad:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Small size<br />Limited power consumption<br />Simple setup<br />1080p HDMI output<br /><br />Cons:<br />High price for not including memory, SSD, or even a power cable<br />No USB 3.0 ports<br />Intel HD Graphics 4000 is not compatible with Directv2PC<br />Limited storage options/space<br /><br />This little machine is very easy to set up when it comes to adding the RAM and mSATA drive; it only takes a couple minutes and it's up and running.  After making a bootable Win7 USB, Windows was installed within 30 minutes.  Unfortunately Win7 doesn't have appropriate NIC drivers for it, so those have to be loaded via USB.<br /><br />The audio and video output is good, it handles playback of videos without any issues.  It works well as a HTPC except for one hitch -- the graphics card will not work with the Directv2PC application.  If you want to use that, get another machine with a non-Intel graphics card.<br /><br />All and all, the price just seems a bit high for what you actually get.
0307895475|5.0|Great guide for the price. sells for over $60 in Australia. My sons refer to it during the game. Great strategy guide.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|I kinda like it i meen kinda a waste of time though misus well just go on YouTube .it's kinda good i meen the app could be us full sometimes u can buy it but its not perfect its ok though
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Loved the differant take on magic.<br /><br />Had a couple little twists to it that were great.<br /><br />Character development was solid as was the writing in general.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Ok so i downloaded this because it was the app of the day and its &quot;worth&quot; 5$.. This thing sucks i wouldn't pay a penny for it
B002GYI9C4|5.0|The take on Magic was great<br />Characters were wonderful<br />Story was good enough to pull me in and kept me reading
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|this movie was poorly written,and had random<br />details that were inserted at the worst times. (naked lady doing Kung Foo?!)<br />the Acting was sub par from the B list actors.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Great Idea and well put together.<br />Characters were awesome as was the take on magic.<br />I wish that I was an Allomancer
B003INBNXO|5.0|Wonderful movie, highly recommended.  Outstanding action, great sets and historically accurate sets. Several movies have come out that show the struggles when Japan invaded China. This movie will really help you understand the centuries long struggles between Japan and China.  Outstanding, one of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good app for killing time help features for when you are stuck and good choice of games to play.  definitely reccomend

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw  the movie before I read the book and  I have to admit, the movie was Just like the book. I loved the details in the book that didn't make the movie. Love it! Can't wait  to read book 2!
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I'm enjoying this but after I purchased this for the Kindle I discovered that text to speech was not enabled! I purchased this because I dislike reading the small fonts in paperback books and didn't want to pay for a hard copy book.  I love being able to mix computer assisted reading with reading the actual text, especially in a book of this length.  sorry but its a deal breaker for me, because of reading issues relating to AD/HD and Autism I find listening and reading at the same time makes it possible for me to read much more quickly and with increased comprehension.  I'm sure this is a good book but I wish text to speech was enabled.  I'll probably get through it eventually but doubt that I'll continue with the series.  I don't understand why, in 2013 with computerized e-book and handicapped accessibility built in, all e-book readers don't include text to speech. Is it possible that some of these authors would rather sell Audible book versions instead of providing text to speech for people who really need it. yes I like Audible and trained readers very much but that's not the issue.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is mindcraft on the go take it wherever you like, to the beach to the pool tho the library anywhere you like
B000AL730O|4.0|Nice music if you like McCartney.  I do so I enjoyed it.  Still laid back and not very upbeat.  It fits nicely into my collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The struggle is real and I think we forget just how real it really is..great book. Loved the story, and the friendship shared by these characters
B00742BVW8|3.0|Well the action is good.  It pretty much left me cold story wise but lots of people get the crap beat out of them and the action is fantastic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read!!!!  Loved it from beginning to end!!!  Kept me thinking the whole time!!  Colleen writes in a way that you can really feel the emotions that the characters are going through!!!
B009MO5960|2.0|Let me first start out by saying I am a hurge fan of the resident evil series and liked all of them except this one.  The movie starts out ok but as it goes along it just really goes in the tank.  My advice; save yourself the truoble and save your money and go to redbox.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awsome fun game! Really entertaining! Keeps you busy for awhile. Like having your own pet horse without the expense or hassle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game it amazing. its good for little kids to play and to have a good time!!I think they should make more games like this for kids to play!!!:)
1475143389|3.0|Solid advice -- might be cheaper to look online, but then the question is: &#34;would the information in this book be more reputable than a website trying to sell subscriptions?&#34;
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I loved this book sooooooooo much!!!!!!!<br />Jeff Kinney you are the best wrighter ever!!!!!<br />I really enjoyed reading your really awesome story I hope that you have other app people in this world that love this book!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|When not enough time to do something else...play solitaire.<br />Good presentation and hints show you what you missed.<br />Enjoyable diversion.
1452110581|5.0|Being a cat lover and reading this book was fantastic.  Loved the insight the author put into his words of what the cat is thinking.  Makes you wish your cat could talk.  The illistrations and pictures were so adorable and lended a truthfulness to the words. A good fast read that made me laugh out loud many times.  I gave it as a Christmas gift to a dear fried (after reading it myslef)  Ho ho ho !  My philosphy is to never let a good book sit idle on a shelf.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Outstanding dystopian sci-fi. This is destined to become a classic. I usually can find things to pick at in just about any story, but this one was completely satisfying in characters, plot, pacing, and writing style. My only complaint is that the subsequent stories aren't available yet! I just finished reading this a few hours ago and have purchased the prequels and am eager to start them this evening.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Being an old Sherlock watcher from way back to early TV and black and white I love the new spin put on an old story.  Of course my favorite Sherlock was Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Watson but this pair of charachters match my vision of the pair.  Good exciting fantasy drama to watch sitting at the edge of your seat.  Pop the popcorn pour your drink before sliding the disc into the player becasue you do not want to miss any of the details.  Enjoyed it thourghly!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't stop reading these books !!!! Love it !! They always keep you on your toes and wanting more !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The finalization of a love between a good woman and a mixed up man was more then I was hoping for.  The books were all filled with sex and also put you on a journey with the main charachters which was pretty fantastic.  Loved the series and the writing of both the heated sexual parts and the growing relationship between the couple.  Good read for those that are romantic at heart.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|She is very unique and has a very relaxing voice.  There's a deluxe CD of Born to Die that features 3 extra songs and she also has another CD called Paradise.  I prefer Born to Die over Paradise.  Only really like two songs off Paradise.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I had little piano before but hence the name, it was too small. I've never gotten lessons but I'm dying  to and with this app I've got a head start. The only thing that bums me is that they removed Bella's llulaby (the offical one because they do have River Flows In You!) This app is great for anyone.
B005DJ7TQ6|2.0|FIRST OFF, I loved the movie. While purists will be in dismay with how Thor and Asgard are portrayed, how the story is interpreted for today's audience and incorporating Thor in a \\"scientific\\" way in order to put him in the modern Marvel movies I felt was creative. HOWEVER, THE BLURAY QUALITY leaves a LOT to be desired on the RENTAL READY version at least. There are NO visible scratches on my disc but three times the disc would skip, stop, and go bubbly all over the place. If I put the machine on SLOW forward I could at least see what parts I was missing, but no sound obviously. I don't know for certain if its a problem with my machine or with the disc--so if you haven't had any problems, let me know please and I can change the review. Thanks for reading.
B003VANOFY|5.0|No complaints at all.Comfortable, good sound, and they hold a charge for a long time. If they do go dead there is plenty of cable to charge while you use them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a well developed plot with great characters.  It didn't end the way I thought and I was glad because life is complicated like Christian and Ana's relationship.
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|A really enjoyed The Story of film, how Mark Cousins was able to show what was going on wi nth films all over the world and how he could show the samples of the movies he was talking about. For me, maybe an actor could narrate it better.
B0025KW29U|4.0|This movie has so many great actors that I feel like they were holding back on their characters but it was still a good movie and greatly enjoyed the singing, not usually like musicals.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. It as the best reviews then any of the Mine-craft apps please buy this and rate it 5 star!
159562015X|5.0|It definitely did what it intended to do.  My friends and I all found it to be very useful in identifying our niches and seeing each others strengths.  The results were very fitting for everyone who took it.  It's a very accurate book that is great at making your strengths very clear and concrete.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|superb acting. A poignant story about a towering figure of our time. I tells of the triumphs of her success and the tragedy of her ensuing dementia.
0345803493|5.0|Although there is a lot of repetition in several areas of the books. I found myself giggling like a school girl as i read it. No I do not have a college degree in English literature, I enjoyed this book very much. I wasn't worried about the editing, i was to wrapped up in the book to care. I read for enjoyment not to pick it apart. Ana, although a college student is very naive and  is somewhat of a breath of fresh air. Those of us who loved the first book couldn't put down the second. And are anxiously awaiting the 3rd to come in the mail.  Even at 50 myself, I still believe in a fairy tale. So just set in a nice cozy chair with good lighting. Pull your knees up tight and get lost in this wonderful series of books.
0896760278|4.0|The historic information available in this book is invaluable to me in addressing the clothing worn in the 19th century.  I interpret a farmhouse, so my actual wardrobe is a very utilitarian one.  However, the exposition on the ways patterns were disseminated, and the &#34;secrets&#34; of construction are wonderful....this book is &#34;eye candy&#34; of a very practical sort!
0142412147|4.0|Let it Snow is a collection of three holiday romances that all intertwine with each other. I really didn't think that I'd like this as much as I did, it was the perfect pick me up and it definitely put me in the holiday spirit. (constant streaming of the Christmas station in my house) I was surprised that all of the stories were connected, but if I had read the synopsis beforehand it wouldn't have been that much of a surprise.<br /><br />The characters in each of the stories were unique in their own way, and I loved how they all knew someone who knew someone who was featured in another one of the stories. I would love to go into detail about each story and the characters that are featured in each one, but if I was to do that I'd spoil parts of each story.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light, cheerful holiday read then Let It Snow is definitely the book for you! And if you're a fan of any of the authors who wrote for this anthology (Maureen Johnson, John Green, Lauren Myracle) then I would recommend this book even more to you.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The game is always entertaining and challenging without being frustrating.  I also like the fact that some clues are available.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this book about a year ago,  then purchased the next 2 in the trilogy. Also purchased the movie. I decided to go back & purchase book #1 so I have the whole set.  I am rereading and enjoy it even more the second time around!
B005LAII80|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1FMUSNPUJM6J2]]I watched Dredd in 3D on a fiftysomethinginch Samsung just before laying down this review. The 3D makes a big difference for this title -- reason enough to remake the earlier film! Whether In two dimensions or three, this film rates at least four out of five Netflix stars.<br /><br />Grain of salt alert: I'm a fan of movies like Bad Lieutenant, Donnie Darko, Con Air, Equilibrium, that movie where Philip Seymour Hoffman huffs model airplane fuel, Gummo, Welcome to the Dollhouse, and My Dinner with Andre. Caveat watcher: Let the reviewer beware. This one's terrified, I assure you.
1428143262|3.0|1) Rating: 3 out of 5 stars    2) Genre: Young Adult    3) Synopsis: At 16 you become a Pretty. You stop becoming an Ugly and become a Pretty. Who wouldn't want that? There are a few and Tally's best friend is one of them.  She must decide between friendship and becoming pretty.    4) Feelings: I have heard people mention this book quite a bit and wanted to try it out. I feel a little bad giving it a 3 because it certainly wasn't a bad book. Just didn't grip me. Has plenty of story and some action. It is one of those books that ends making you want to read the next one.    5) Final recommendation: Even though I only gave it a 3 I would certainly recommend it if the premise sounds interesting. The story moves along and the characters  are appealing.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|We first heard of Rodriguez on a TV news story.  Then heard about this movie.  WOW!!!  It makes you smile.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I do not want to judge this movie on what it lacks. I have read countless reviews on IMDB that crucify this movie for being inaccurate and lacking in scientific reason. I found this movie to be a hypnotizing cinematic experience. The CGI sucked me right into the movie, and I was only watching the 2d version.<br />I will admit that I have never watched any of the Alien films that came before Prometheus. I do not see this as a bad thing. Prometheus stands on its own just perfectly, especially since it is a prequel after all. I will also admit it took awhile for me to get sucked into the world that this film creates. The story gets set up superbly around the mid point of the film and the CGI starts to really shine.<br />With an abundance of bonus features, this 4 disc blu ray package is a steal at $19.99. I would rate this as one of the best single blu ray releases of all time in terms of bonus features. Normally the studios save the gazillions of features for the super duper limited editions. Not for Prometheus.<br />Anyone interested in a good Sci-Fi flick should see Prometheus. And with all the bonus features this is a real steal!!!!
B0030SCPZ2|5.0|This movie shows off the thoughtfulness and talent of each musician!<br />This stuff doesn't happen by accident!<br />These are Smart/Talented fellows.<br />Keith Hughes
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Its okay, ashame the villain was not better.  It needed more action scenes with Dredd while doing his job.  Gee
B004V5A7K8|5.0|If you have the time to play for a long while this is a great and somewhat relaxing app. Time will pass fast on this one. I think it has great graphics, colors are nice  too.
1449433251|5.0|Who doesn't love some good Calvin and Hobbes? And even crazier, who wouldn't want the entire collection in hand and ready to read?
B002M9WW30|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it was well-received. Now it's in a collection of beloved films and concerts and has a great new home. I would not have bought this for myself but I'd love to have it. :)
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Esperanza is one of a kind,I don't have many words to say about this CD other then good nice songs. nice band...good job..
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm giving this a one-star because I can't give it any minus stars. This book is the most juvenile piece of crap I've tried to read in maybe forever. If general public opinion says anything about the minds of those readers who sing this book's praises, I'm scared for all of us. I mean, this isn't just bad; it really sucks to the core. I'm used to literature; this is bargain basement toilet paper.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I give this book 4 stars.  I was surprised in the end.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I only rented this; I did not buy it and I'm glad I didn't. This was an entertaining enough movie but  certainly not earth-shattering. (Come on, what would you expect? No pun intended.) It was worth the price of the rental but I don't need or even want to watch it again. Now, for me, I can watch a &#34;great&#34; film until I literally need a new copy. So, for whatever that's worth, there you go.
1557048630|5.0|I love the dragons in this movie and wanted to see the methods behind the drawings, it is a great book
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is a rare remake that improves the abysmal stallone vehicle with incredibly amazing 3D. Dredd is one of my favorite movies and is truly entertaining!
B00908DDZM|5.0|I don't listen to hip hop much.  I grew up with it in the 80's and moved on to other music.  I liked a bunch of things in the late 90's but this 'generation' of rappers don't really do it for me.<br /><br />Then I heard Thrift Shop on the radio (on a rock station?) and dug it.  I checked it out on Youtube.  100 of those views are from me.  Then I started checking out other songs by Macklemore and Ryan and was hooked.  This isn't your typical rap music, talking about abusing women, partying and making tons of money, it's the opposite, talking about the struggle with the music industry and bucking big business, drug addiction and preconceived notions on what a rapper and his crew are about.<br /><br />If you even remotely like hip hop, check them out on Youtube.  If you end up liking the music, please buy the CD and support these guys who are positively changing the genre of hiphop for the better.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This is one of the best spoofs of James Bond there is. I just wish that it was still on.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful and exciting read kept me on my toes through the whole book .. I have read all three books and I loved them all..
B000SW2F6M|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others that like movies about history and the crusades.<br />Three more words needed!
B0084U0IEG|1.0|The ultimate bore.  It was hard to suffer through this age - the cold war and womens liberation.  No real espionage or intrigue.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|The help function could be better. The interface could be a bit more intuitive. The biggest problem, though, is a glitch that causes the program to accidentally eat whole sentences when trying to delete a singleword or character. This is rare, though.
0684857219|5.0|you can't go wrong with arnold he tells stories and gives u good tips but most is from back in the day tips this book is a good read but if you want to get big get Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding! its a little more up to date!

B008HK3XKO|4.0|Overall, I like it - especially the flexible band around it.  It does have a tendency to slide when standing.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I read it for 5 or 6 days it was long but I finished it so that means I don't have to read it
0761171703|5.0|I had seen segments of the book posted online and immediately fell in love with the premise. What a treat to experience the entire collection. This item was on my gift-giving list this Christmas and i'm sure to share it again.<br />I cannot praise it highly enough !!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|2 hours of my life ill never get back. Nobody like able with little humor and gratuitous violence against animals
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this (my first Reacher book).  Funny in spots, believable story line, covertly romantic without being overtly over the top.  Definitely made me a Lee Child's fan.  Tom Cruise is the wrong guy to play Jack Reacher.  Wish they would have picked someone closer to the real Jack in the book.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|A tad slow of a set up to start. Rebus is back and he grabbed my attention for the full day of reading needed to complete the book.<br /><br />Rebus is as irascible as ever. Rankin handles Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland well.<br /><br />Super book, smoothly written, with a memorable lead character.
0345803507|1.0|I won't go into details just like the 5-star glowing reviews are as laconic as they can be.<br />I will just say that this is the downfall of something as beautiful as literature. This book has a right to exist just like any other book, but bestseller? Really? It means this is something that thousands and millions of people liked or loved. I can't believe it. Are people really so sheeplike? Are they so easily fooled by marketing tools? Probably they are, otherwise this world would not be as f#@$ed up as it is.
B00991TCOG|5.0|After, discovering her on youtube and watching her videos of her music, I just absolutely had to buy this CD.  Although most of her music was on her youtube channel, with some covers of other music, I wanted to support her buy buying her CD.  I was not disappointed at all.  I still listen to her music, and I actually ended up buying some tickets to go see her play live on her 2013 tour in Gainesville, FL.  Every song has a different tempo, different beat and is absolutely gorgeous.  The only bad thing I can say, is the cover music isn't on this CD from the youtube channel.  Most likely because of copyright issues, but I'm not going to take off points for that.<br /><br />Do yourself a great favor and get this CD and begin to enjoy a great new upcoming artist!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It has good graphics and action. It really is worth the money. I highly suggest this game for children ages 9-14
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This tale was a sweet, very readable account of a couple who find themselves living together but worlds apart and the journey that eventually brings them back together. I really enjoyed the story, glossing over a few pages here and there where the descriptions of vegetation along the road grew a bit thick. Several  meaty issues to discuss with a book club!
B007MAETA8|3.0|John Mayer is my favorite musician, I can relate to the majority of his songs. I enjoyed his previous albums tremendously but this was not his best effort at all!  I thought that it was borderline country, not really matching the blues or jazzy side as his last album. The only songs that I really like is Love is a Verb, Queen of Califronia and Shallow days. Besides that, this is not something that I will brag to my friends  about.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We are enjoying this second season as much as we did Season 1. Appreciate the closed caption, as well. Excellent!
B009NPK1IO|4.0|GG has fallen off since the first seasons, but it's still good. Amazon's playback is solid.  Overall worth watching it.
B000002TYX|5.0|I purchased the other two anthologies when they first were released, but I'm not sure why this one slipped by. Some of the first tracks are crude tapings and very scratchy sounding, but history is history, which makes these cuts invaluable. It is both fun and interesting to hear the evolution of the band, from their very pop-oriented beginnings through their experimental phases. Interesting how they pretty much returned to their roots, while in turn putting a bit of an edge on those roots. Great CD set; even better anthology set!
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|My husband and I watched this on my new tablet while on vacation and we  both laughed and laughed.  He had picked it out to download, so my expectations were lower than usual -- so I was surprised when I liked this movie so much.
0446554995|5.0|I enjoyed Two Graves a great deal. It did have lots of fantastical elements and cliffhanging predicaments. Poor Pendergast's body must look pretty grim by now, with all the abuse he suffers. I like the slight overlap with the Cabinet of Curiosities, my favorite Pendergast story of all. Preston & Child's writing style makes good, intelligent yet light, fast and exciting reading. Corrie Swanson's character has been beefed up with more accomplishments, so we can expect more of her. A new character is introduced that I'm sure we'll see more of in future Pendergast books, too.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|Normally, I'd consider myself a fan of Crichton type novels.  However, There was something about this book that I couldn't get behind.  It might be that there wasn't enough back story on the particular thing that made this book possible.  I haven't made up my mind on that.  Also, being from Hawaii, where the story is set, I found myself torn between appreciating the author's attempt to accurately portray Oahu and not.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|An amazing French Revolution story.  It's a little hard to get in to, but stick with it and it's worth the time.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So sad to see this series end. Very haunting and mesmerizing-I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to anybody regardless of age.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|This was a good book, but it wasn't great.  That being said, it was easy to read and held my interest fairly well.  However, the book left me wanting something more.  I'm not sure if it was character development, plot line or just general story action.  It just felt light or at least a little anti-climatic.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This was a good read because it has interesting characters but the plot seems to be propelled by force rather than flowing naturally. I don't like that Thor does not have more detailed battle scenes and that his warning to the king was blatantly ignored. Thor also seems to bumble along and have a lot of things work out for him that shoulnd't. That said, I think the ending was nice because it seems like Thor is facing some real predicaments. I sincerely hope that the second book spends a decent amount of time teasing out solutions so that Thor is a better paced character. Overall, this was an enjoyabole and fast paced fantasy book. I highly recommend for teenagers interested in fantasy.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|I have watched this many time in VHS and wanted to experience what Blu-Ray could add. Not as much as I had hoped for because the VHS was quite good, but the story and music make this a five star for me.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Entertaining and just a light heated movie to enjoy!  Charlie sheen was just great in this comedy!  I will be watching again!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Fisrt of all. I never thought that I would enjoy a novel with a female protagonist as much as I have this book and the next two which comprised the &#34; girl &#34; series written by Stieg Larson. Totally fascinating European themed ( Sweden ) crime series that grabs your attention immediately and then won't let go! When I finished the &#34; Girl who kicked the hornsts nest &#34; I was very disappointed to find out that the author had passed away and that the series is over! Why can't another author such as Eric Van Lustbader or Justin Scott pick up where Larsen left off? I am sure that everyone who has enjoyed Lisbeth Salander's exploits so far, will definitely rush to see what happens next. Best 3 books I have read in a long time and I read a lot!
B0058VW36U|5.0|A real thinking game.  Makes you think about move that are coming next.  Just plain entertaining.  Kids love it too :-)
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Any book that I cry reading is a good book to me! It made me think about what my dog is trying to tell me!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Super movie with lots of comedy.  I can see the real world in this flick!  Entertaining all the way through the end.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|fun game. easy to learn and fun and enjoyable to get an expert rating on the levels. Hours of fun and a game you can play for hours or pick up and put down as you please. can get a little redundant but that could be because I have played so much!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|. . . and Act of Valor was just what the doctor ordered. I wasn't always on the sidelines. I did my combat tour in Southeast Asia a long time ago, and I have found most war movies either too intent on shock value, too \\"John Wayne\\" or just too unbelievable. [[ASIN:B007AL0RZA Ike: Countdown To D-Day]] is my all time favorite, which would indicate my preference towards honesty and thought process. What a treat Valor was! So many scenes that were totally captivating in their believability when held up to the light of what and who I know.<br /><br />The family scene on the beach was so well thought out, and set a soft undertone to what the viewer knows will be a violent film. Even so, just as others have said, the killing was not promoted to front and center stage. Rather, it was dealt with as it had to be, and then we moved on. The fast boat stuff was amazing! The Gatling Gun rumble was perfect, and that alone brought back such vivid memories of another time in my life.<br /><br />This is a very watchable movie . . . perhaps a must watch. I just saw Zero Dark Thirty in the theater, and it did not measure up to Act of Valor. I was grateful to again feel immense pride in the unsung men and women of Special Ops who are trained and willing to give so much in service to you and I.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was a book i found worth while to read. As a retired Navy man, I spent a littel time with the Teams and wanted to know more about Chris. Found this was definitely worth my  reading.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I wanted to reread Cloud Atlas the moment I finished it. I thoroughly enjoyed each of the six stories on their own, but was blown away by the way they were linked to each other. The writing is clever, the stories are great reading, the characters are believable. Their stories are likeable, even though the character may not be.<br />I found I wanted to discuss the plot and the links and the individual stories as I read Cloud Atlas, and I also want to talk about it to anyone else who has read it. Everybody takes something different from the book.<br />I'm not sure I can add more to the story without repeating what other reviewers have said, or giving spoilers, but I do want to say that if you struggle through the first chapter, and don't know what is happening, persevere. You will be rewarded.

0525953590|5.0|This book goes into great detail of what the Higgs is and what it means to have found it. But it also gives you a great history of science and physics. It talks about the physicists who have worked so hard to develop the theories we have. It was very well written. I had no trouble following along. I couldn't put it down - I read it in about a week. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic. The best part is that it's a very recent book discussing a very recent topic, so you do actually get the most up-to-date information. Great book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hopelessly in love with this book. Amazing author, have read all her books and she never disappoints. One of the best books I have read so far this year. Patiently waiting for more by this author.
0670026603|5.0|It has been quite a while since I read a book that I couldn't wait to get back to. Me Before You is the kind of book that you keep with you during the day in case you find yourself with an extra few minutes to sneak in a page or two, and one that you can't wait to tell your friends about. As you immerse yourself in the lives of Lou, Will, and their families you will contemplate the challenges they face and the questions they raise, but mostly you will feel their hope, despair and surprising moments of happiness. For me, Me Before You was an engrossing and truly enjoyable read.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I'm a high school teacher, and my school, like many others, has been exploring the issue of bullying. My class recently discussed whether or not bullying could realistically lead a victim to commit suicide. That conversation led to us to the conclusion that you might never know exactly what someone is going through or thinking but it is at least worth trying to start a dialogue with the victim or even the bully in case you can make a difference.<br /><br />That conversation occurred Wednesday morning. I mentioned the discussion to another teacher, and she said it made her think of this book. I read a sample that night and just couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt like Hannah's voice was haunting me. I had to know her story. I purchased the book on Friday and finished it Monday morning. It's that good!<br /><br />I am considering trying to bring this book into our high school curriculum. I think it could be a valuable tool that I could use to open up the lines of communication between students and their friends, students and their teachers, students and their parents, and even a student and him or herself. I think, if nothing else, this is a novel that will make people think of the consequences of their actions and how their words affect others. And that's a lesson we could all stand to be reminded of on a regular basis.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|Not sure why it took a  12 year old and her programming father to come up with this, but I'm glad they did.  Very easy to use and great for checking homework,  calculating  yardage and whatever fraction  calculations you would like to do quickly and easily.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A little violent but good writing. Good character development. A little drawn out at parts but jumped right into the action.
B00755646W|4.0|This film is just as exciting and thrilling as when first released. A true tribute to Madonna and her super special dancers.
B000IK8JTG|5.0|Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights  with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Finniess - It is the best one!!!! The chemistry they have with each other is very seductive - Ralph Finniess is qiute the bad boy!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is really helpful to keep track of several important locations. I can see the weather conditions of our family. Plus our current residence and our future retirement home. It even gives me the weather in Bosnia Herzegovina.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|fun for a quick play. my kids love it. its easy to understand and naviagte throughout the game. no flaws that i can see
B000L53D4O|5.0|I ordered this and had it shipped to my first and only grandson for christmas. i know he recieved it in time and im sure he enjoys playing with it
B0082FPIY8|5.0|Great insights and an easy read! Not the most creative writing but you can over look this as you go on a journey with Cheryl that gives you pause about what is important in life!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|this is a must have for any Megafan. for the price you just cant pass it up and the live cd is classic Dave with all the attitude you can possibly hope for. simply awesome
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is great. Scary. Dark. Gripping. Suspenseful right to the last chapter. Unpredictable.<br /> Far better than gone girl.  Loved it!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have ever finished reading Save Haven but I am in love with the story and the characters. Nicholas Sparks books have their own charm that cannot be matched by other authors. I highly recommend this book and the movie will be in theaters in February so hurry up and read it first!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|First of all, as you can tell from my pen name, this film was going to get major points from me just by virtue of its heavy [[ASIN:B003CRM6QO Flash Gordon [Blu-ray]]] emphasis.  For non-Flash Gordon fanatics, there is a lot here to like.  Starring a raunchy, sex-crazed, coked-up teddy bear, this film obviously doesn't take itself too seriously.  At the same time, there is warm-hearted Toy Story-ish theme throughout.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg does a great job playing a bit of a schlub with a sometimes unhealthy attachment to Ted, his childhood talking teddy bear.  Mila Kunis is good in the girlfriend role as she becomes increasingly irritated by Ted's constant presence in their lives.<br /><br />Did I mention Flash Gordon?  Sam Jones's extended cameo was hilariously awesome.  Watching him and Wahlberg recreate the scene on the spacecraft from the Flash film was a treat and well worth the price of admission.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love Angry Birds,so I checked this out. It is similar to AB,and yet different. Fun for the whole family.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interestingly worded book. Peaks the interest. Keeps you engaged-did not want put down. Occasionally difficult to follow. Well developed characters. Want to read next book in series.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have never been good at this game,but it was free,so I thought I would check it out. it's fun,but makes you think.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Loved it.  Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it also.  I love the fact that this is a toy that my granddaughter can use her imagination with instead of just sitting with her eyes glued to the TV.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this. It really makes me think I can play the piano. It's fun for the whole family. Check it out.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to everyone.  The story line was very interesting and kept me awake at night.  I didn't want to stop reading.  The characters were well designed and interesting.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I mean really what is there not to like about this show? It's about a serial killer,but he only kills the bad guys.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun to play, very interactive too I was looking for a game that I could actually play that wouldn't get boring an finally found one
B002NHGG92|5.0|I love everything about this show. It is great. If you like Twilight you will like this show. Great story lines.
B0079J28NW|5.0|never been a big fan of the Beatles but I really enjoyed the movie and the music and it really s
B005JR47R6|5.0|What can I say about this show? It is the best of the best. I wish I could say the things he says.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|We loved the game of thrones can't wait until the next season comes out will be getting the combo for ever season
B009AP2G26|5.0|This was a really sad episode. Season 4 got back to the heart of glee. What it was in season 1.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I got this for m boy friend and sat and watched the first one with him I will watch the rest of them
B00A757EFW|5.0|Who doesn't remember playing this back in the day? When there was nothing else to do. I suggest that everyone check this out.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good continuation from the hunger games, but not at the same level.  Still I enjoyed the continuing adventures of Katniss.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|this was a great app for my daughter who was up to level 20 until it completely reset itself. she was very upset. now she is starting it all over again asking over and over again if it is going to happen again.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this game because it is very relaxing and the music is some what soothing.  It also challenges your mind and your ability to compare and match.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We watched it 3 times the first day. Good for my 5 yo and I love it too. Glad we purchased it
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Is as all Patricia Cornwell books are written.  Questions that need clarification at the beginning and answers at the end.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I happen to be a Fan of the group..Like all the songs on the CD. Would recommend the CD..thumbs up!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)<br />It is well written.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0050BPIB0|5.0|It's not often, that you purchase a CD and that you're gonna like each song.  The CD's songs are excellent.
B00406TRU4|5.0|For anyone who enjoys fantasy, wizards, dragons and kings, it's just a lot of fun.  The relationship between Arthur and Merlin always gives me at least one laugh-out-loud moment per show, but it also gives heartwarming moments as Arthur, the haughty prince, learns to trust and genuinely like the young Merlin, who at this point is &#34;undercover&#34; as Arthur's serving man.  Liberties have been taken with the traditional Camelot tale, but who cares?  I love the romance, the brave knights and the evil sorcerers.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|very useful and well written book. One of the best programming book I ever read.<br /><br />[review required more words, so I wrote this ]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun app for the horse lover. Only down side is figuring out how to get more gems!<br /><br />But very fun-
B009FZHYKU|5.0|watch it!  The emotion level in this season reaches a new height.  One of the best shows on television! Love it.
B009329Y30|5.0|For those that like a steamy, romantic chick flick...this is one of the great ones. A good one to watch over and over
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Characters are very well developed and realistic. Personally I couldn't enjoy a series more than this one. ON TO THE NEXT BOOK!!!!!
B004Y6CV1M|5.0|So prompt. Perfect. Brand spanking new! Record never had been touched. Superior sound, and love all the tracks on the record!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Riveting story.  I started to read and couldn't put it down.  Two pilots lives changed by an event of kindness.<br /><br />It also gave us a look into a country that was swept by a powerful party that came into power as a minority and won by dividing the country by &#34;classes&#34; similar to what we are hearing today.<br /><br /> An uplifting story in a time of sadness.
B0045HCJSK|4.0|A good entertainment. One of Scorcese's favorite &#34;hero&#34; films. Dean Martin is excellent as the drunk who battles himself and the bad guys. Walter Brennan is a hoot!
B007M45PMU|5.0|The lumineers are amazing. This album is great through every single song. Can't wait for there second album in the future.
B0068FZ1C8|4.0|If you dance you'll like this movie. It really is a good movie for children to watch. Very inspiring little film.
B0091VTISO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Lost a little bit of steam at the end, but still a fun watch if you like action/fantasy.<br />Yes lots of unnecessary slaying, blood and such. What does one expect from a Conan?
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game for a tablet! Graphics are outstanding and games is challenging. I found myself playing this game for over an hour the first time.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Do you ever completely know your children and understand what they are capable of doing to themselves and others? The parents appeared to not have a good line of communication with each of the children.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|wow - my son is a musician and loves this.  My husband is a music lover and asked for this for christmas after having it lent to him from a friend.  A very interesting discussion with 3 great musicians...
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|This doesn't have any real &#34;big&#34; stars, but boy oh boy it was riveting!  The actors did a great job!  Would recommend it to everyone (if you like scary movies).  Great lesson learned!!!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I love this show and to have the show at that price, when everyone was asking essays too much was truly outstanding I definitely recommend!!!!
B00007KQKM|5.0|I would recommend this love story.  I received it quickly and in wonderful shape.  Thanks for the esperience, I order again I'm sure.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is well made. You have different ice age animals you can put in your village. Also you can arrange your village in any format you want. You constantly get missions to help make your village bigger. It is easy to get earn ice age money to pay for items but hard to earn get acorns to pay for most items.
B000069HZP|5.0|I love this movie and decided I had to have it.  I received it promptly and in great shape.  Thanks for great service!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game, with realistic graphics. It would be nice if the horse was more responsive when you pet it though.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|I love this dvd, she hasn't done a dvd since good girl gone bad and even tho its wasn't as good as gggb dvd, it was very enjoyable, by favorite performance was dont stop the music, what's my name, love the way you lie, and we found love. All round it was a great dvd.
0684857219|4.0|The edge is abit scratch. Overall is good. Quality paper. Packing is almost perfect. Brand new book. Colour is black and white
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It' s a really awesome game. It has excellent graphics and shares the responsibilities of taking care of a horse. Amazing!
B00280LYHS|4.0|I have enjoyed the first series, I will have to read the other books. Have always enjoyed Greek and Roman Mythology, wonder if there is more then some truth in these stories.<br /><br />.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Its a fake and not the original lifeproof case. The knock off is cheaper but feels cheap and does not turn phone to vibrate. I will be returning it... very disappointed and I don't give bad reviews.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book I have ever read. Truly an amazing thriller that leaves you excited to read the next book. Can't wait!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time.  The humor, the story line, the characters played their parts flawlessly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great for all ages.<br />My son's and I are addicted to growing are village.. it's easy and simple but a lot of fun.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|This would have received a two start rating bit Ms Lawrence was able to breath a breath of life into a movie...
B00A757EFW|3.0|I haven't played this game since I was a kid. It's hard to play this game when you haven't played it for a while.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is entirely too addicting but it's loads of fun to play.  I probably play entirely too much and thoroughly enjoy it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I simply could not put it down. This book even had me looking more into the assassination just for curiosities sake. Great story Mr. King, kudos!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have not been able to find a series in years that I stayed up all night to read. And here it is. Entranced is an understatement. I was under the spell created by E L James and her wonderful mind.
1451648537|4.0|There is no doubt that Walter Isaacson knows how to write a biography. If you haven't read his books on Einstein and Franklin, and you have any interest in these men, you should. He does a great job in researching and an even better job in bringing out the humanness of his subjects.<br /><br />Steve Jobs certainly has had a huge effect on the world as we know it now. Does anyone not know someone with an Apple product or who hasn't seen a Pixar movie? Reading of his background, his motivations, his demons, his delights, gave me a new perspective on the whole Apple history. Well worth the read even if it meant carrying a big and heavy book on the subway each day. I may give in a buy an e-reader yet.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Isaacson has certain themes, certain issues and he comes back to them too often. I felt like I was hit over the head several times. I can see the theme without having it shoved in front of my face over and over again. Sort of like a TV show or movie that has a character narrating too much of it because someone is afraid the writing alone won't get the point across. Still, an excellent book about a very interesting, if not very nice, character who has had a profound effect on the world as we know it today.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could read this again and again. Made me smile, made my husband smile (if you get me). I can't wait for more.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Every odd-ball or even semi-logical excuse for religion is discussed and debunked in a cool and scientific manner. Dawkins opens the closed door of religious sanctuaries.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Talk about leaving you wanting more. And to think the Christian side of the story at the end was a great P.O.V. Shame she said in an interview with Katie Couric that she does not intend on enhancing that further. I can't wait for the 'other' characters and stories E L James says she has in her mind.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very interesting books that kept my attention throughout. Though very erotic, there's more to the books than that, it actually has an interesting storyline.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|you can do different trains, its kinda challenging, and its a lotta fun.  I think other kids should play it.<br />Caleb 6 years old...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love the game.  easy to play and the horses are so real in their movement.  for me it's a relaxing way to pass time while waiting for appts at the docs office
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this series! The acting by Maggie Smith (and others) is wonderful! The story line is well written and keeps me coming back for more! This storyline will make you laugh, cry and keep you hanging on for the next episode.
0810993139|5.0|My son is a great reader and totaly in ,love with with this book. Although some mothers prevent me about the misspeling of the book and the advance language for a 6 yearl old, he spends hours reading it.<br />I like it too, it is very funny.
B009JBZH54|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for a relative for Christmas.  The product arrived on time and the packaging was clean and free of damage.  I have not heard of any problems with the disks so I assume everything is fine.
B005HSL626|5.0|My Girlfriend Will Spend Hours Playing This Game On My Kindle. She Loves It, I Would Suggest It To Everyone (And It Get The Girlfriends Off Your Back lol)
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|A gifted voice, and a genre I would not necessarily delve into, but my wife loves her music and singing.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Alittle Confusing At First But Is Easy To Use After Awhile. Songs Could Be Better Quality. Will Use Again In The Future
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Ok, so maybe it's not quite as good as some of his others, but it is still a riveting read.  Well worth your time.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I read (far too many?) crime mysteries and thrillers -- this one was stellar. Un-put-down-able. The plot is naturally gripping when dealing with a society that has had it drilled into their minds that no one can be trusted. \\"Check on those we trust\\" is a phrase heard often in this story and what a telling phrase that is to paint the picture of this time.<br /><br />I was even further interested in the plot when I found out that Smith was referencing a true crime that occurred in Russia during the 70's; serial murderer Andrei Chikatilo. His crimes alone make for a compelling story but when set in a Russia where crime has been officially eliminated due Communism's \\"fairness\\" it makes investigating these crimes a crime itself.<br /><br />The characters are well-drawn and you are engaged in their stories from the beginning. No one is safe so every action has double the suspense. One of the best parts of this book is that it is a part of a Trilogy meaning I knew I would be able to spend more time with these characters I came to know and care about.<br /><br />Please read this book. Not only will it make you supremely happy to live in the times and under the government that you do but the price is a steal!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Looking forward to a new season with hopes that will it continue for a least serveral more years to go.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Predictable reads are generally deemed at most 3 stars in my world and this book indeed made it easy to determine where the story was heading...so, Dear Reader, why 5 stars??<br /><br />This book's characters and the way they interacted was ...magical. It was something you NEEDED to see played out. I did not want to put this book down and lost quite a few sleeping hours to this read. Young adult fiction or books that tell a story in that setting are not my favorite genre; especially with the plethora that are available now. The majority of these I have found to be sappy, forgettable and regretful wastes of time that I only get 3-4 chapters into before deciding to move on. This is not in that category; not even close.<br /><br />I had to investigate when the book had so many glowing reviews and I am glad I did.<br />You will be too...click buy now and enjoy your foray into this young couple's messy, convoluted, REAL, and amazing lives.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting story and proof of faith and healing but too heavy on the techical and medical side and would like less.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't be any better, this has been the best season! The crew is seriously badass!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|As I purchased it I believe I should be able to pass along to other Kindle Fire users.  It makes me made that I cannot and in the future will limit was I will buy as I can buy the hard cover and pass around.
B009K6DKTS|4.0|This book has genius & counter-intuitive insights that really work.<br />e.g. The act of trying to protect something by shielding it from harm may weaken it<br />And we actually often benefit from harmful things that fail to harm us. Because we defeat the threat and end up with surplus threat defeating capability.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have said, the author's tone goes over the top and gets annoying.<br />And it's too wordy - he could have covered the same brilliant points in far fewer words.<br />Reading is best accomplished in instalments; with breaks to recover from his style.<br /><br />But highly recommended.<br />Just hard work to get to those diamonds.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As I purchased it I believe I should be able to pass along to other Kindle Fire users.  It makes me made that I cannot and in the future will limit was I will buy as I can buy the hard cover and pass around.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed is all screwed up and won't show them in sequential order.  It's really annoying and its enough to make me finally stay away from Facebook.
B001FXCE46|5.0|I just love it, sound is clear no problem downloading to PC, i will buy music from amazon again in the future.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Great quality, seen it live too. Just wish they showed more of the crowd interaction in the beginning and more of the clowns. The part they showed with the clowns on here was a serious scene they could have left out.  Worth the money, worth buying!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A little slow but I liked it. A nice family movie without R rated language and scenes, I would recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Just wanted to try it. I,m not into games of any kind. My sister was raving about it.,so I had to try it.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Dexter is a great show. It's full of suspense and dry humor. I'm completely addicted to watching it. I would recommend it to adults who like drama and police story-lines.
1476712042|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was really good. The story will grip you from start to finish.
B006O6F932|3.0|Typical of a Barbie style house, takes longer to set up with lots of tiny pieces, but my daughter likes it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the horses are well animated and sound effects are nice. anyone who is looking for a well made horse sim find it here. included are taking photos, treats,training mini games, lots of neat horses you can buy later.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think this was one of Grisham's best.  It really held my interest until the very end.  Good job John.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The story itself was so unbelievably contrived and devoid of reason that I really just wanted to put the book down. By the end of the book every character was so unlikable that I was hoping I'd wake up and it had only been a nightmare.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a geeat way to collect and share information of all kinds.  I love the dyi catagory and health/fitness.  What really hooked me were the beautiful pictures of far away places.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a very entertaining writer. He's not always spot on with his story telling, but I always get through his books. I think this was my favorite of all of his.
B005LAIISA|5.0|The kids love all the ICE AGE movies. They have already watched it a couple times. We haven't gotten to watch it yet.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wasn't expecting a very sophisticated level of writing when delving into this series, and I got exactly what I expected. It wasn't 100% original, but it the story had enough creativity that I got through it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 9 year old grandson surprised me by wanting to see the movie which I would have gone on my own to see.  Very enjoyable. Bought the movie so the other little ones can enjoy when visiting.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I gave book one 4 stars because I knew what to expect and it was fine. This was just more of the same except that each character seemed to turn into a spoil brat that needed to be put in timeout.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|So for those who may not know your tv must be able to connect to the internet in order to use this app as a transfer over to tv. They don't make that clear when they say &quot;any TV&quot;. The app is cool but it's more like a collection of apps from the market in one place. I had a micro HDMI cable for my Fire HD so I'm not too worried about the connection part. However, doing it from my phone would be fun. But I actually have already figured that out the long way around thanks to the android community. In all, I'd pass on this, I got it for free.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show has the suspense, action and story line that makes for a good series. Claire Danes is great. How she consistently gives the illusion of &#34;holding it all together&#34; while you can see everything getting ready to &#34;explode&#34; is amazing.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I enjoy the game, but have had a lot of problems with it shutting down in the middle of the game on my tablet.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I've been watching this movie with my family during the holidays for years. I bought a copy for my 2 year old grandson this season and the joy of this little film was renewed! It's probably the most underrated holiday film. It's visually beautiful, sentimental, heartwarming and emotional. And because it's entirely visual with a beautiful sound track, it appeals to all ages. I highly recommend this film for everyone everywhere!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I LOVE VAMPIRE DIARIES! And now, Amazon has made it so easy to access my episodes - I can watch from my computer or stream it through my Blu Ray Player.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|HBO does it again! They have created a terrific story and then ruined it with pornography. This time they even included naked children and a 10 year old (don't know the exact age) nursing (with her complete breast exposed).<br />Just like they ruined Tudors, the same can be said of this series as well (even more so!).<br /><br />HBO WAKE UP!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book makes you feel a roller coaster of emotions it's that good. You'll fall in love with all the characters. Give it a shot and stick with it until the end, you won't regret it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great App this game is like the only thing i play so much fun recommended for everyone a must have for the kindle fire
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie is a gem. If you have never seen it, you need to. While it is a little vulgar at times....welcome to high school!
B000002AGN|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to order this.  I love it.  I received it quickly and in great shape.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a good book. It is sad, and poignant, and loving in a way that more books should be.
B0052GACNM|1.0|This CD came and I was excited....but when I played it, the CD player said no disc available.  I don't know what that means, but after trying it elsewhere...found it was not a working CD...empty of songs.  I complained and got a new album...although not the Duets II album.  It was Duets: An American classic.  Confusing...I don't hate the album.  Just this being the wrong CD.
B006YM9JSW|4.0|I pick this processors for the excellent review and benchmarks testing with the ASUS motherboard i recently purchased. this combo made a excellent choice.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|Note- this is about the Legacy version of Raw Power, the remastered David Bowie version.<br /><br />I won't even try to review the actual album- there are people much better suited to analyzing it's legacy than I would be able to. Regardless, it easily stands as one of the most important rock albums of all time. Rather, I'd like to defend the Bowie mix, as it seems to get an unfair shake these days.<br /><br />David Bowie's production efforts on Raw Power have (perhaps rightfully) received their fair share of criticisms over the years. The mixing is bizarre and uneven across the entire length of the record. The whole thing feels like all involved had no idea what they wanted the recording to sound like. But in spite of (or even because of) all this, the rough around the edges recording only served to add more intensity to the proceedings. When it came time to update the sound to 21st century audio standards, there was obviously divergent opinions on how to proceed.<br /><br />Iggy Pop's opinion was, apparently, to push all the faders up to the point that the waveform turned into a black rectangle of digital clipping.  Multiple people across the internet have dissected this phenomenon better than I could. Google \\"Raw Power waveform\\" to see what I mean. The problem is, overdriving digital audio equipment does not have the same effect as pushing a tube amp to its limits- it sounds like a shredded speaker and robs all dynamics from the audio.<br /><br />Bowie's mix (and this remaster), for all it's flaws, has dynamics in spades. And thankfully they were able to restore a lot of depth to the audio that's been missing on all previous digital versions of the album. The bass is clear and the instruments are clearly defined, but the added clarity doesn't take anything away from the rawness (sorry) of the album- it just gives you more to listen to. Is it not loud enough for you? You have a volume knob for a reason.<br /><br />Yes, the recording is janky. Let's call it personality. With an album as charismatic and important as Raw Power, shouldn't it have personality?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book. Like the series. Recommended to all ages. Liked when the end came. Didn't like it when prim died
B006TLFPKO|1.0|Sucked ballz bad acting and everything! I regret ever making my poor eyes watch this I don't understand how this got four stars. What has happened to our generation? If I had enough money I would remake all these movies with better actors and plot.
B003KK65KG|5.0|I Love most of Jodi's books, but this one was a real eye opener especially after USA tragedy of late
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I couldn't put it down. The twist and turns made it so exciting and interesting. It was one of the most original stories I've read in a long time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I normally read  urban tales, but I am so glad  I  came out of my comfort zone!  After listening to my coworkers go on and  on about THE Christian Grey, I had to read  this for myself. If I am being honest, yes, some things are repetitive, but I  didnt mind it . I love how descriptive the writer was. I  know exactly what these characters look like, what Christians apartment looks like, what their love looks like!  Also, the fact that a story is built before steamy sex begins was very  much appreciated. I like good sex scenes just as much as anyone else, but there is much more to this book.. The characters are so complex, the story so deep,  and their love so passionate. Read this book!!!!!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this move is great. the story is a little weak but the players are amazing. the animation is the best I have ever seen. I would recommend it for any one that doesmt care if it tells a true story. If you are the type that would say, &#34;Oh that would never happen&#34; then dont bother with this film. But I think its good for any one else say above the age of 7.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a good book.  Unfortunately it concerns an aspect of our society that is very sad.  It's well written and touches the heart of the reader.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|another Robert downy Jr. flick. I think this one was better then the first. I didnt care much for the first one so I didnt go see this one at the movies. I got the dvd and its good!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|More than often, analysis in reviewing a \\"story\\" goes too far beyond the purpose of that story. In this case, the purpose of Penumbra, is simply to entertain the reader. That is what this story does. There is no overwhelming profundity. And, while there may obvious - or maybe, not so obvious - truths, observations, and commentary, they do not invasively detract from \\"..simply entertaining.\\" (Did I neglect to add the word \\"story\\" to that last sentence?)<br />Thus, I'm happy to have participated Penumbra's jaunt. I met some unusual people, re-visited a couple of cities where I'd easily expect these people live, and vicariously enjoyed both their individual, as well as mutual adventures.<br />It was a good story.<br />mario
B005LAIH4A|5.0|this movie is funny for any one with a light sense of humor and a kids heart. the voices are terrific and the animation is cute too. I watched it before passing it on to my Grand daughter. she loved it too. she is 7. the story is all the trees are missing now except for one place outside of the town where no one dares to go. so this one brave boy who has a crush on a girl that all she wants in life is to have a real tree. very colorful!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Seriously can't stop listening to this album. It consumes me. One of the top albums of ALL TIME for me.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I saw this movie on the big screen and decided I had to add it to my dvd collection. the acting is superb. Johnny Depp is amazing. its not for the faint of heart or children. there is a sex seen that is.... well shall we say wall busting? LOL! Great Movie and I dont think it lost alot being on the smaller screen.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham books and this one did not disappoint. Love the story and surprises throughout. Another great read.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is definitely a fun, entertaining game thats good for beginners and expert puzzle solvers alike! I recommened this game for anyone who enjoys puzzles!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Predictable, easy to read, but sweet and a reminder that sometimes what happens in Vegas should really stay in Vegas
B001B2CPH2|5.0|I think this movie is one of the most fun, funny, and emotional twists of a ghost story ever! It is without a doubt one of Demi's best performances. I remember the year it came out - I rooted for Whoopie and Kathy Bates (Misery) during the Acedemy Awards...AND THEY BOTH WON!<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie...just do it. I wasn't the biggest Swayze fan but deeply regret his untimely passing. He seemed like a nice guy and he was very good in this film as well.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Great music! Not too serious.  Several good actors (except for my taste, they should have somebody other than Tom Cruise) fun to watch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its fast paced and really fun with the obsticles. The music really sets the mood and everything ran smoothly. Have not had any problems with the game so far, and for being a free games its worth it.
B00005JM02|5.0|I received the dvd within a few days and in time for Christmas. Very pleased with the purchase.<br />Very happy with the purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and easy game. Great for people that love horses and cannot get the experience in their own lives. Has great graphics and quality.
0307730697|5.0|One of the most uplifting and heartrending books I've ever read.  Tremendous.  His life, his extreme problems, but with his wife and children his Faith overcomes all.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|great concert at a great price the audio was very good and the theater was really nice worth owning this
1609611543|5.0|This doctor has a point.  I thought at first that I had Celiac desease because of some reactions if I ate wheat.  I am also Diabetic and carry too much weight around my middle.  I was tested for Celiac but do not have it but it does not mean the doctor told me that I am not sensitive to wheat.  So this gives me many ideas of what I can do to cut down on Wheat even tho the latest food craze is whole wheat in everything.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very good to read. Great plot filled with excellent erotic scenes. You want these to be a couple and learn their secrets.did not put it down
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun and simple to play. Great way to kill a couple of hours. Cool storyline and graphics. The monkey option is cool as well. Enjoyed this game very much.
1591844096|5.0|This is an amazing work by Seth.  I have bought copies for my employees, friends, co-workers, even investors.  We use it as inspiration for hiring, team building, and it is a centerpiece for the cutlure we are trying to create in our businesses.  Well worth a read for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the reason i went to the appstore everyday my sisters both had ot on the other ipads and would NEVER let me play it this game is amazing i ride real horses and this is the game that relates most to it./
B007M45PMU|5.0|&#34;Flowers In Your Hair&#34; instantly became one of my favorite songs and it was a great way to start the album. The Lumineers sounds original in a market of Folk saturation.
B00770KR7W|5.0|They got Master Chief, so close to game like that he is awesome.....Halo fans will not be disappointed!!! He is very cool!!!
B0084P9202|5.0|My first exposure to Sigur Ros was from Mysterious Skin. Yet when I listen to Sigur Ros, it feels like a juxtaposition of torment and serenity. It never stops colliding thoughts and emotions through the music. If you've never listened to Sigur Ros, you're doing a great disservice to yourself and this is a great starting point if you want to rectify that error.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I was hooked on this series by the first few paragraphs. Pulled me in, kept me in. On the third book already and I just started a few weeks ago.
B00011RPB0|5.0|As a graduating college senior, you learn to look back on the few moments you've wanted to relive and you wish you could have again. Lost In Translation is a great reminder that these moments are isolated covered in their own splendor. The movie is a terrific piece on friendship and longing, how they are symbiotically attached to each of our lives. The cast is magnificent and exemplary.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like the Harry Bosch series in particular, however all of Connelly's book reflect significant research on subject matter so the reader actually learns a good deal about how our police and judicial systems work in the real world.  Always suspenseful and very well written, I normally finish one of his books in less than a week.
B003R0MF5S|5.0|Memories of buying Subway subs, checking Nielsen ratings, and the glee of Monday nights are usually elicited when thinking of any season of Chuck. This season in particular was great at giving us more insight into each character and fortifying their unity. While the main antagonist turning out to have Intersect roots felt a bit contrived at times, it did not prevent the season from feeling like a step in the right direction.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although I try to watch this on PBS as it is aired, I've found myself watching the episodes at least once again after their original airing.  If you enjoy productions that are well done, witty and totally captivating, watch Downton Abbey.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|I bought this gun for my son. His father and him<br />have a blast playing gun`s around the house.<br /><br />  Thank You,Angie
0385737955|4.0|I loved the Maze Runner! It had a very Hunger Games, Divergent type feel to it. If you like books about Dystopian societies, you'll love The Maze Runner! Here's a quick summary of what you'll find in the book:<br /><br />Blood/Gore: Heavy - throughout the book, there were a few rather disturbing deaths. If blood and violent death scenes make you uncomfortable, be cautious! The author describes some bloody deaths in detail that may be disturbing to some people. So beware!<br />Disrespectful/Bad Attitude: Very Heavy - the boys in the Glade treat each other poorly, calling each other \\"shuck-faces\\". Everybody seems to be at each other's throats.<br />Frightening/Tense Scenes: Heavy - this is actually one of my favorite parts of the book . . . there's a lot of suspense. A lot of chapters keep you on the edge of your seat and you'll constantly find yourself saying, \\"all right, only one more chapter and then I'm done\\". It sure is a page turner!<br />Guns/Weapons: Mild - from what I remember, there's no real mention of any weapons until you begin to read towards the end of the book. Although, there are these creatures called Grievers that seem to be equipped with weapons (needles and pincers and such).<br />Profanity: *Minor - although I can't recall use of any REAL cuss words, the boys are constantly saying \\"shuck it\\" and \\"you shuck-face\\", which is obviously a substitute for the f word. I know that some people count the word \\"bloody\\" as a cuss word, so I might as well mention that one of the boys is CONSTANTLY saying \\"bloody\\".<br />Violence: VERY heavy - this is one thing that bothered me about this book. Sure, there's going to be violence in a book like this; it's expected. But what got me was how much UNNECESSARY violence was just thrown in there, almost as if the author just kind of went, \\"oh, let's mix things up a little\\" and threw a few random, unnecessary violent death scenes into the story. Some of the violence left me going, \\"what was the point of that?\\" Some of the violence didn't help the plot in anyway and there was no purpose behind it. So, if violence bugs you, steer clear of this book!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVED the Maze Runner! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good book to read. I will say this: in the beginning, I had difficulty really liking the characters, but towards the end I LOVED them! So just keep reading and they'll grow on you! :) Throughout the book, there are some surprising twists (which I loved)! I can't wait to read The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|It's a great movie to watch with friends or basically anyone. It has a little bit of everything, drama, comedy.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I found this tasteless and poorly written.  Storylines that were brought up (her parents' divorce, her Step-Monster, the boy who was too nerdy to sing) were either dropped completely or tied up far too neatly with a bow.  I wanted to like this because I love acapella, but the grossness was not earned (you want to see earned grossness? check out the latrine scene in Slumdog Millionaire), and the trope of showing them singing &#34;The Sign&#34; over and over got more tired and less funny than if a more clever method had been used (for instance, for the second and third times showing them doing the song, but with no sound--just the bored reactions of the crowd).  Not a good movie in my book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A wonderful story about how t it feels to be different, and what it means to be kind.  It takes you through one year of fifth grade from the perspective of several different characters in the story.  An easy read for adults. A good story for anyone who is in or has been through the middle school years.  This book should be on every middle school's 'must read' list!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This book started off gangbusters and ended whimpering in the corner. It's worth reading, but it's not a great book, and it is certainly longer than it needs to be. The climactic scene is completely unbelievable, which is a shame because the premise of the book--returning through time to stop the assassination of JFK--is intriguing and the first part of the book is amazingly good.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I did recommend all versions  of his records to my friends,best we have had in a long time love Adam Lambert
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous cast, costumes, recreation of a by-gone era....everything, fabulous. The writing is superb, nothing is dumbed-down, (thank God,) and your adrenal glands can have a rest from insane non-stop action movies that have no true story development. Ah, real art in movie form. Love it.
B005URRCUY|5.0|This is a really good album and I would recommend it for the track Gold on the Ceiling alone... but wait.. you also get a bunch of other great rocking tracks too.. so don't hesitate to buy it :)
B0059XTUB8|3.0|Would have enjoyed &#34;more story,&#34; I don't know how else to put it. She did a fabulous job portraying Marilyn Monroe...I am not sure I loved the lead young man, but that's just me...certainly would watch it, still not sure if it is a &#34;must have&#34; for your video collection...but I think too much, so there you have it.
1419703692|4.0|I loved this book, it's amazing. It's like having all the extras on a DVD feature with the charm and style of an art book. Production notes from the film's crew and Christopher Nolan himself, a lot of unreleased production photos, sketches and a whole lot more. The only thing that bugged me is that the The Dark Knight Rises section isn't as profound as the rest of the book. It's understandable giving that this book was released before the movie but it would've been nice if they could go deeper into TDKR. All in all it's a gorgeous art piece and is highly recommendable if you like, either the movies, or all the paraphernalia around the making of a film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics, but very shaky. Most everything you need to pay cash out of pocket for. It is all around average type of game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thoughly enjoy this series.  The UK version is more detailed and gives me a bit more insight to the characters.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its a good app, now i am able to log in to my face book page whenever i want, even while in bed. its the same thing as being on a pc. i recommend it to any one who would like to be relaxing in bed and want to be on face book. Go for it!
1451627297|5.0|ordered for christmas present showed up in plenty of time in good shape and they loved it for a gift.
0689853637|5.0|Love these books, kids look forward to them every Christmas, regardless of age.  They are done so well and show imagination with the winter scenes.
B001NRE9II|5.0|this was a christmas gift and they loved it. i am pretty sure they have already started reading it. arrived on time and everything.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This is not Google Search as I thought it would be. Instead, there are a series of strange, egg-shaped icons containing words such as \\"people\\" \\"places\\" etc. I never really understood if I was supposed to types searches there. I was not able to get it to work at all, basically. Just give me the simple old box to type in and I'm good! Too much going on, not functional (for me, anyway).
0525953728|5.0|After reading this book, I don't see what anyone's upset about; the people making a big fuss about the &#34;secrets&#34; revealed in this book probably are just Obama-lovers who can't stand for anyone to express displeasure about their idol. It seems logical that any military member could at one time or another be dissatisfied with the tedious nature of governmental bureaucracy. It's the nature of the beast. That's all I saw in this book that could be viewed as disparaging. &#34;No Easy Day&#34; was thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Fans of Harry Bosch will not be disappointed. As always, Connelly furnishes the reader with enough info on Harry's demons and foibles to keep him as the relatable, kind yet curmudgeonly detective he is. The story takes place mostly in the San Joaquin Valley of California, and, being a lifelong resident, I will say he got most of it right. The plot moved along nicely, and a sense of urgency to solve the case as Harry works against the LAPD bureaucracy kept up the pace, which is sometimes lacking in cold case stories. All in all, no new ground here, but when something isn't broken, why fix it?
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This was recommended to me and I was intrigued by the description they gave me of the opening pages.  It is not usually the type of book I would buy, but I did and enjoyed it thoroughly as a tale of improbable coincidences and hilarious incidents.  I think those who have likened it to Forrest Gump are quite right, though I have only seen the film and have not read that book.<br />It was most entertaining and moved quite fast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I can say is that this book mad  me laugh and cry. I couldn't wait  to turn the pages and keep reading this story. It's a must read.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|When writing a story such as this; one that deals with such sensitive issues as disability and euthenasia, you are always going to have a group of people who will not agree with the point of view you put forward. For this reason I admire Jojo Moyes immensely for being so brave in writing this story.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes has shown great skill and sensitivity in using the various characters in the book (the quadraplegic client, the carer,the nurse, the parents, ex-girlfriend, sister) to voice the differing points of view on Will's decision to end his life. Too often people look at the issue of euthenasia in black and white, without considering the 'personal' and complex issues that surround it.  I think this book achieves that in a non-judgemental and entertaining way.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this book down. Loved it loved it. This is Nicholas sparks best book yet. Would recommend it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I felt with all the hype around this book that I should read it - what a waste of time that was. I mean it when I say I do not get how this book has become a bestseller - it is poorly written, barely erotic, is unoriginal, has repetitive language, and is rather boring and unsophisticated in a teenage kind of way to boot. There are so many better books out there, why has this book become so huge? The average Mills and Boon novel is better than this.  Not one of the love scenes had my heart racing - it lacked the detail in the description to do that.<br /><br />Just like with the Twilight series, I was also appalled at the depiction of the main female character, Anastasia. Is it now perfectly ok for Generation Y and Z women to be dominated by their male partners and play the helpless victim unable to look after themselves, to be treated as a fragile thing needing protection? It is becoming a theme in these bestsellers which I find disturbing.
0451197879|5.0|I find it odd that people give this book a bad review. People complain of it being boring, hard to read, unable to \\"hook\\" you. I found the complete opposite. This is my favorite of the Bachman Books and honestly one of the best Stephen King books overall. I was fully engaged. Many times I find it hard to really get into a book, but I didn't want to stop reading and go to sleep. \\"Just one more chapter\\" I'd tell myself. (This is VERY rare for me!) This is the story of a man pushed to the edge. A story of a man whose life and very existence is falling apart. A man whose mind is falling apart. We watch as his mental health very rapidly deteriorates past the point of no return. I found this to be a very compelling, very believable story. And very well written. Dawes does some bad things, but you can't help but pity him. This book hooked me from the beginning and kept me there for the whole ride. Definitely 5 stars. Definitely the gem in the Bachman Books. But honestly go buy the Bachman Books and get 4 novels. But definitely read this book!
B0041VXGRS|5.0|I'm a baker, who for whatever reason never tried making cake pops. They're sinfully easy & delicious. This book makes them a literal cake walk! Cute designs, recipes & product recommendations that I've actually used. Way to go Bakerella!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is such a good read!!! It had such great twists, it was a real page-turner!! A must read book!! :)
B009MO5G90|5.0|The 3D is awsome in this movie. One of the better in the Resident Evil series. I loved this movie
B00973902K|4.0|It's an upbeat song with a catchy chorus.  Rocket science or deep meaning?  No.  Fun to hear while cleaning the house or wanting something upbeat?  Yes.
B006G2124E|5.0|This is an all time great movie.  It gives you an inside look at the way the South used to be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was something about the book that made me want to read more I'm glad I read it and can't wait to read the others!!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|i thought the game was a challenge and it took some skill to time the ball to hit it and it was fun.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Bought it for my kindle and my three year old love to play it! I am not sure how to play it but she has fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Characters are easy to get to know.  The lightness of season one returns in season three without WWI going on.
B0063IH60K|4.0|For a free app, this is a good buy.  The settings are variable, and you can customize the way you play.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The case looks nice and was easy to put on the phone. It offers good protection for the back and sides of the phone (which both scratch easily in my experience) without adding a lot of bulk. The directions for putting on the screen protector were clear and should have worked in theory but I got a lot of bubbles. I ended up throwing the screen protector away but I am still satisfied with the purchase - it is better than a lot of similar price alternatives I have seen.
B00884GR0W|5.0|its a good game but there is 1 bad thing about it. when you make a tool you get like 30 hits but you should get like 100 if it is stone. but over all it is a good game. and it is not minecraft it is VARY different.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|at first its kind of hard to understand but then it just makes sense.  I love this game though, good for horse lover's, or just animal lover's period.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Episodes 4-6 are always a classic, but watching them on Blu-Ray for the first time was unbelievable -- It was like we were there in the movie! This was a gift for my fiance for Christmas, and honestly, the price could not be beat...especially for the quality!
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|there is no way to look up a word without using the &#34;scan&#34; bar at the bottom that I could discover--very frustrating!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game at first I thought that this game would not be even worth it at all. but when I did play it it was like I was in minecraft heven !!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is a page turner. I was very entertained but I was not a fan of the ending. Can't stop thinking about it.
B0060D0R2C|5.0|Riveting suspense that keeps you pondering what is happening...<br />Great concept that makes you wonder what is possible regarding the nature of time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not read this book for a long time because I read a lot of reviews complaining about the ending.  There is nothing I hate more than reading a good book with a displeasing ending.  This book did not turn out to be that because it was just an okay book with an okay ending.  I think it helped that I was prepared for a bad ending.  This book took a long time to pick up.  I was 47% through before the plot finally began to unfold.  When it did the book was just okay.  The beginning was hard to get through because the author was doing a lot of character development, which I did not need.  Sometimes the mark of a good book is that it leaves an impression on you, good or bad.  This book did not leave an impression on me.  I feel the author led you to the ending she wrote.  I read this book out of curiosity.  If you are curious like me I would recommend looking for something else.  It's not worth it.
034580404X|5.0|50 shades of grey<br />this is a great trilogy, i will recommend it to all my friends.  I love it
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this book a dozen times when I was a little girl.  So glad that I have the opportunity to read it again.  Thank you.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I like Ellen. I do. I like her humour. This book, her other books, not so much. I have read all her books. How come? Because I \\"thought\\" - this one will be different. This one won't be her stand up routine that I have seen several times. Nope. Not so. This book was EXACTLY like her latest HBO special. I liked her stand up routine on HBO. I expected more from the book. No, Ellen did not \\"enlighten\\" me to anything that I haven't read/watched/heard. This book is just blah. I was not impressed with it at all. I think she actually regurgitated some of her old material into this book - yes, I did see her routine on Johnny Carson - and not on YouTube - when she actually performed that night. I reiterate: I like Ellen and her humour but not this book nor her other books. She did make $$ from me by me purchasing her books. I do get tired of the same old schtick. No more Ellen books, please. Just not worth the money. Watch her stand up routine on HBO.
B000002HPT|4.0|This album sounds and feels a bit different from most other DT albums. A bit more organic, but overall darker, less rosy.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Everyone should read tom sawyer and Huck Finn as written. not the watered down comic version of today. it is an enjoyable story and more importantly, it lends a human side to a time when people in retrospect want to make everything seem to be either good or bad, no middle.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for a Rod Stewart fan.  It was very well done, and we both enjoyed it equally.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I don't love the music as much as I did watching the movie, but I can accept that seeing as I am largely a visual person.  No complaints.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Three stars for this app. It works well on the Kindle Fire-no hicups...however, the learning is limited to a few songs then you have to pay to HEAR and/or Learn the others. Yes youtube has it all, but this app is good for practice because you can see the notes as well as play them.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|Haven't had enough time to try it out yet to give a balanced opinion. I like the availability of the passwords I forget.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this storyline very much - lots of well though out characters, a great &#34;creepy&#34; feel even to the heroine.  However I did have the killer pegged extremely early in the book and figured out the last piece of damning evidence a chapter or two before the end, so that was disappointing a little.  Appreciate that the author is allowing this one to be loaned - wish she had that feature on all her titles.
B0024RID6U|5.0|What can I say? If you like the Stones then you will like this CD. I bought it especially for the song 'I'm Just waiting for my friends'.
1481251880|4.0|In Hopeless, Holder tells Sky he \\"lives her\\". He doesn't quite love her... yet, but he more than just likes her. That is exactly how I feel about Hopeless, I didn't love it but I more than like it, so I live it.<br /><br />I am completely blown away with all the reviews I have read for Hopeless and of course I love Colleen Hoover's past works, Slammed and Point of Retreats, both books being my favorite books of all time. When I started reading Hopeless I was all set for this epic book, so maybe my expectations were just too high. Don't get me wrong because it is a great book. Be warned, the book deals with heavy issues such as sexual child abuse and suicide.<br /><br />In Hopeless you will meet 17 year-old Sky. I really, really LOVED Sky. She had problems that she didn't even know she had to deal with but when came to face it; she was strong and dealt with her issues. She is such a unique character. Then there is Holder. Holder is one of the most amazing, smart, perfect, emotionally invested male book characters that I have EVER read. He is pretty amazing and the way he was with Sky and the things he said to her took my breath away. He seemed so much wiser than 18 years-old. Holder had issues of his own, mostly guilt for past events he feels he is to blame even when he was not. I just wanted to hug both Sky and Holder and take away their pain.<br /><br />So why didn't I love it? I felt some scenes in the book were a bit slow and boring at times. I loved the minor characters in Hopeless, like Six who is Sky's best friend and Breckin, the \\"Mormon\\" she met her first day at public school. The book kind of forgets about these two and I missed them a lot. I love Sky and Six's text messages and their fun conversations. I would have liked to have more of ending with them as I did with Sky and Holder. I was also finding myself comparing Hopeless to The Sea of Tranquility. They are very similar and I prefer TSOT. So that was more me for comparing the two books.<br /><br />Hopeless is a unique and special book about coping with tragedy, making peace with the past and those who negatively affected your life, finding love, and letting that person in your life.<br /><br />I give Hopeless 4 Stars.eless is a unique and special book about coping with tragedy, making peace with the past and those who negatively affected your life, finding love, and letting that person in your life.<br /><br />I give Hopeless 4 Stars.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny and good music. The charcters are cute and likeable. It is a fun uplifting movie. My teenager liked it more than she will admit.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Her music is always good and this one is no different. If she had been on American Idol I don't think we would<br />have known what we were missing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always enjoy Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp novels.  Like books that read quickly without more description than plot. hate having word limits here.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game; the only problem is that you lose energy really fast, but you can gain it back pretty quickly. And I also wish you could earn gems faster and more easily.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is great as wel as plot. I really like the storyline as the producer developes each character. It is a must see but it becomes addictive in a good way as you really always want to see more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great episode!! The walking dead never fails and this episode is what brings me back for more. The drama and horror. It just works!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved it! Exciting. Gripping. I didn't want to stop reading when the mission started! It makes you proud of our military. I appreciate being able to know what happened. Of course details & names had to be changed for security reasons. UBL gave up without a fight while all the others around him died(except for women & kids). Now I'm ready to see Zero Dark Thirty & the NatGeo documentary!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book inspired by this book. It was so magical! I love when the tin wood man was so kind to all those people
B00APUQT7I|4.0|I've seen all of the Ice Age movies with my family,(husband and children). These movies have a great story line to follow, and always teach a lesson. Amazon instant video was easy to use and no downloading is the best part. Instantly plays after purchase to enjoy watching..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's simple and very fun with the horses are very cute and very playful and very cool stuff like competitions

B0079R8KXG|4.0|I decided to get this case for my Kindle Fire after reading all the positive reviews. I turned out to be a great decision.<br />It's easy put on and remove and has sturdy protection. I especially like to use it in the horizontal mode for hands free viewing of videos.<br />I purchased this during on of the many promotions Amazon provides. If you need a case for your KIndle Fire be sure to check out this one!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very informative app. Tells you how much time you have left on your battery for various activities you may want to run. I like that when you plug in the charger this app starts automatically and tells you how much battery life is left and flip one page and it tells you how much time it will take to charge your battery back up. I also like the last page that informs you how your battery is doing, like the health of your battery and the temperature and even keeps track of the last time the battery was charged. I love this app, best one I have found so far!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have recommended this book to several of my friends. i loved it, especially as it is set in England where I am from.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. A 21 st century fairytale. The scenery is beautiful and the acting is wonderful.<br />A must see!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just started watching a few weeks ago and am already caught up. Fantastic series. Makes me want to go to England and visit the real Highclere Castle. Love watching history unfold through the family.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Always keeps you guessing. I watch this with my daughter.....so happy they have signed on for a fourth season.<br />Show is nice to watch if you have a daughter.
0307959856|4.0|The ladies of the family received the book for Christmas and all thoroughly enjoyed the story. A bit slow to start but then totally satisfying and engrossing.
1741797802|4.0|There's a lot of information and most of it is good. The history, religion, culture, food, etc, sections are concise and informative.<br /><br />The biggest downside is that a lot of space is taken up with descriptions of 4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|Interesting Documentary because of the Notre Dame fiasco.  I am running into variations on people matching websites.  You just have to get too the realities before you get to involved.  Do people checks and phone number checks to see if they make sense.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like the odd, creepy, and deranged side of life then this is a show for you. If you are super religious then this will definitely offend you and you should avoid it all costs.
1419702238|4.0|This book is much the same as the others.  So, if books #1-5 appealed to you, you will like this one too.<br /><br />The 'cabin fever' of the title refers to Greg's situation of being snowed in at home--with his mother and brothers and no electricity.  However, Greg is not necessarily anxious to return to school because he just might have, accidentally, caused some vandalism there.<br /><br />Greg is in mortal agony:  desperate to get away from his family and go back to school but also dreading going back lest he be arrested and sent to prison!<br /><br />This is a topic that so many kids can relate to--the awful feeling of having done something wrong and just waiting for someone to discover it.  Young readers will also be able to relate to a snow day gone haywire.  Many days off with only your wacky family for entertainment and no electricity and the food choices less than yum-worthy.  This read should make every kid appreciate school.<br /><br />I've seen lots of complaints on Amazon from parents that Greg is not not a proper or acceptable role model.  He isn't supposed to be!  This is pure over-the-top escapist fun.  Everything that Greg says or does is a lesson in doing the exact opposite.  That's what makes these books so funny.  Grey says and does things we wish we could say or do, but human decency prevents us.  Greg is not humanly decent, for the most part.  But, he sure is fun.  This book, all the books, are for adolescent reluctant readers, for a reason, and those readers will love this new installment.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|I like this one the least of the 3 Bond movies of Daniel Craig.  Can't wait for Skyfall to come out on Blu ray

1612130607|2.0|If you don't know about this book, or at least this series, you are obviously a hermit. This has been the talk of the world for a while, but before it was published, it was a free online story based off of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight. And I first read when it was posted on fanfiction(DOT)net. And I enjoyed it, but I was never amazed by it. I am not amazed by the published version.<br /><br />Oh what to say about this book... I liked it. I did not love it. I'm still not keen on the idea of authors using fanfiction to get into the writing business. In my opinion, it should be for fun, because ultimately, you are basing your work off of someone else's. And I have seen side-by-side pictures of this series the way it was posted as a fan fiction, and of Fifty Shades of Grey. THEY ARE 97% THE SAME. Where has creativity gone? If she had reworked it and toyed with new ideas to add to the story and somehow changed the story a bit, it would be different. But she didn't and I don't approve.<br /><br />Plus, the main character literally makes me hate to be a woman. I'm by no means a feminist, but reading about Ana disgusted me. What a great role model to women and girls everywhere - this is sarcasm. She lets her life be controlled by a man she has known for like two days (maybe more like 3ish months, but still). And she is brought into a BDSM relationship because she thinks she can't live without this man, Christian Grey and the only way he will be with her is through a submissive, unromantic relationship. Now, I have no problem with BDSM, it's not my thing, but I enjoy reading some stories that involve it. This BDSM? It felt awkward and unrealistic to me. There were a lot of times when I had to shield my eyes from things that Christian did to Ana, things that shouldn't be sexual.<br /><br />This book just doesn't sit well with me. The writing is amateur and the author tries to work too many \\"fancy\\" words in it. I think she used a thesaurus too much because some of them didn't even make sense. What. I just... ugh.<br /><br />I skimmed a lot. I got bored really quickly with Fifty Shades Freed. I actually skimmed most of the series. Because this was porn. Not saying that porn is bad, but I expected more. If you took out the sex scenes in this series, you would probably cut down three books to one. There is no disguising it. The plot is a ruse.<br /><br />I may be one of the few people in this world that didn't like this series. And this book and just thinking about the way Ana behaves makes me want to go back and give them all one star. The reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because of the ending. THIS IS A SPOILER - I'm a sucker for books with children - END OF SPOILER. I'm very disappointed in this series and the author. Overall it receives a great big MEH.en make sense. What.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|OK, I was skeptical when my daughter wanted the family to watch this. I thought &#34;OK, at least I can nap.&#34; But it was a very fun, funny and engaging movie. Not too deep. But a fun movie that will keep your attention. Lots of good music.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my family.  My son enjoyed it.  He is six years old.  He is usually a little scared of movies like ParaNorman.
0525953728|4.0|Good book I want to see the movie to see how Hollywood spins the story.<br />I had times that were hard to stay with his writing but I would give the book 4 stars.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I like the story line; however, the movie was boring. It went way too slowly.  There was not much excitement.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|At first the idea of changing the show up ever season seemed to strange to me I automatically hated it, but I have to say it's working really well for American Horror Story. The cast has become more of an acting troup, preforming different rolls. This season has been one full of the actors showing just how skilled they are. The plot this year is well written and sticks to the horror genra without being over the top or doing anything cliche. And there were no episode that left you wanting more, and no throw away episodes - every one mores the plot and develops more of the characters story.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I like the idea of family.  The characters were great.  I would have loved to see a better story line.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Loved Beautiful Disaster, could not put it down once I started reading it! Love the two main characters and their banter back and forth!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Best game ever! I just wish it would stop glitching up so I can play more often. Such a great game!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Great show and it is quite captivating.  Will we ever know the secret of Red John.  I also love his deductive powers.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it - had to make myself turn off the Kindle at night. Fascinating, entertaining, and fast paced. Loved it, loved it, loved it!
B000051VWW|5.0|I love Sades music.  I gets down in my soul.  I have listening to her since her first record came out.  Dont miss her music.
B008LZYR0A|5.0|Winner is the first single from Elysium and it is just that. There's not really any need or way to explain it except that it's a really good pop song with a good beat. A Certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\" is a really good dance song with a good pounding beat and rythym. Everything a fan could want. The Way Through The Woods is a toned down introspective song that's a very good track. I Stared A Joke is a tribute the recently late Robin Gibb and is simply spectacular. Neils voice brings out all the emotion and depth the song is about and sadness of Gibbs passing. Wonderful music to back it. Great compilation.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|A Christmas present for my son.  A cartoon to go with the regular movies of the xmen.  He watches them all the time.
B009715NUK|5.0|I absolutely love their new album Elysium so I know all the B-Sides will be amazing. To start off of course is Leaving from the album. A track of amazing emotion driven power. The track never fails to bring me to a stand still in it's cutting sincerity and relatability. Next being Hell which is a poignant history lesson in all the worlds most evil men including some serial killers whose names are fairly obscure to the general public. It still remains very amusing and fulfilling as they always do with their songs. In His Imagination is an amazing piece that all can relate too from something and sometime in their life. It always takes me away with it. Baby a 2003 demo is a wonderful track that has a really good beat to move to, and was also partly used in one track in their ballet The Most Incredible Thing. Worth it plain and simple.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son.  He enjoys all super hero action films.  He has the whole set so far.
0817439390|5.0|I had read a lot of books and articles while trying to teach myself to shoot manually. I even took a local beginner's class. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to take control over their photos. It isn't the end all be all, but it explains manual exposure in an easy to understand and apply way. If you are frustrated with f-stops and shutter speeds, read this book, keep practicing, and one day it will all just &#34;click.&#34;

B004132HZS|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a child, and I have always devoured the books and movie adaptions readily. When the new fad of the modern Sherlock started up I was apprehensive. On a whim, however, I decided to watch a few stray episodes of 'Sherlock' on BBC one night and I was hooked. The directors have done a fantastic job keeping with the story line and the characters.<br /><br />So much was masterfully tweaked to allow for a modern retelling. For example, John Watson fought in the modern war of the Middle East, Sherlock goes no where without his mobile, and John keeps a blog instead of a diary. The writers and directors kept with true Sherlock style and preserved the stories and names I valued so much. This series is wonderfully witty and intelligent.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered about this series, fallen in love with Sherlock Holmes, or wanted something new to get hooked on, 'Sherlock' is it!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Acting was flat, story line was garbled.  I'm a Bruce Willis fan, which is why I rated it as high as I did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an easy game, and can be played without paying. It's very fun for young animal lovers. My 6 year old daughter has loved it.

It's just like any other hand-held calculator, except this works on my Kindle Fire, so I don't have to go looking for one of the half-dozen other calculators I have around the house.  If you have a Kindle or a smartphone, get this or something like it.  Sooner or later you'll have use for it.
030726999X|5.0|The book was delivered in perfect condition but as far as its contents I read with great pleasure as I did the other two volumes As I said you must like this type of literature to really appreciate it
0765325950|3.0|So I've been reading this book for the last week plowing through scene after scene trying to reach the end.  Unfortunately  for me, it was way too much work as a reader.  The last three books under Mr. Sanderson have been progressively worse.  This one was a big hot mess.  I felt the same way about the end of the Mistborn series, the big grand finales seem to get away from Mr. Sanderson.  Frankly, he seems to be trying too hard. As if more and more words, more and more scenes will make up for what is missing - a good story.<br /><br />One complaint about this series in general has been the lack of characters dying.  A great departure from the new voices in speculative fiction such as George RR Martin and Joe Abercrombie where characters die left and right.  Well let me tell you LOTS of characters die.  And yes, some very painful ones considering how many pages have been devoted to them.<br /><br />At the end, you do see closure.  All the main characters from the Two Rivers get to a conclusion with the demons and other characters who have been chasing after them for 14 books. So - there is closure - which is one of the nice things about this book.<br /><br />However, there are so many things wrong that are hard to look over - I'll only mention the biggest three.  First off, the editing is a mess. The breaking between scenes is all over the place.  If the book is supposed to show the chaos of war, it shows it well through terrible editing.  The reader is often jarringly shoved from one point of view to another.  The continuity is lost.  I know from reading interviews of Mr Sanderson that he wrote the story of each character one by one leaving it to the editors to split the stories up into chapters, etc.  So I blame this purely on the editing staff.  Sorry, you really let us down here. There were plenty of things you could have asked for Mr. Sanderson to clean up to re-write.  Instead you took the whole of the story and chopped it to bits.  Really a very poor editing job.  Sorry to say.<br /><br />Issue two is the resolution of key points.  When you read thousands of pages of buildup, you expect a satisfactory conclusion.  However, key point after key point is resolved with an almost flippant attitude.  Yeah you have been waiting for how Rand will deal with the Seanchen.  Wow - that was resolved in like three paragraphs.  So much for the buildup there. Too many scenes reminded of why I don't like police procedural TV shows - it ends up being 58 minutes of building tension, then it is all wrapped up in the last minute.  Usually with some small insignificant reason to catch the killer.  That is how many of the story lines concluded in this book.  Characters die who you've read hundreds of pages about, and they don't even get a death scene.  And yet there are something like 700 pages of battle scenes. Really?  You couldn't squeeze in a few more paragraphs for some of our most beloved characters?<br /><br />Finally the battle scenes are just too much.  I can't believe I am saying this, but really it all could have been handled in 200 pages.  This book should have been 300 to 350 pages max.  There just isn't enough story content to justify 900 pages.  I know, I know, we've been waiting 14 books for The Last Battle.  So you know it had to be big.  But really, it went off the tracks for me here.  I think stronger editing and a tighter story line would have really helped here.<br /><br />Overall - I am glad to finally get to read the final book in this series.  Seeing the final chapter of characters that I have grown to love over the last 15 years I have been reading this series is especially nice.  Will I ever pick up these books again and read through the 14 books back to back?  No - I'm done.  I have so many other books to read.  Thank you Brandon Sanderson for bringing closure to this series.  I look forward to many more years of reading your books. As for the Wheel of Time, it is done.ob.

0316228532|5.0|One \\"rule\\" of writing is to not hop from one character's head to another and back within a scene - unless you're extremely skilled. Rowling does it so beautifully. Also, every single one of her characters - and there are a lot of them - are so REAL. The ending was bittersweet, of course. But the last line makes me think that Rowling was worried about leaving the reader with too good a feeling about the future of Pagford and its residents, so she casually suggests that the congregation was unwilling to see some or other truth or something. One thing about the editing: All the stories cohered wonderfully. The book was a great length. The characters' arcs were satisfying. But the proofreading wasn't as near-perfect as it was in her previous novels.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|If Amazon Prime were added to the streaming options, this would be 5 star. Streams Youtube well, nice for playing videos, flipping through pictures on your device (or on your computer).  Just needs some better movie content.

B009UZBLSG|4.0|Works as soon as it's plugged in. Great for slideshows. I paired it with my bluetooth keyboard/mouse and made navigation even easier. Your device will not charge unless you plug in an additional usb wire into the slimport. The battery doesn't charge fast enough, but it was enough for me to watch a whole movie without losing any charge. Still waiting for a completely wireless solution for android though!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very interesting, captivating book. I really enjoyed every second of it. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It's alright but there's lots of features that could be added. First off the two everyone's mentioning, a sign in feature and a comment box. Seriously, are you just gonna tell me I can't choose from the streams I follow. Another feature that this app really needs is the ability to go to a channel and watch old VODs. As a long time captainsparklez fan, I was disappointed when I missed his most recent stream and because my computer's busted I can't watch it. But it's a free app, so I guess it's worth downloading.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|My husband has been wanting this for quite some time now so I went ahead and got it for him for his birthday in December. We watched every episode together and just couldn't get enough! The story is thrilling and I'm looking forward to reading the books. We just finished the last episode tonight. I was kind of bummed to learn there are only ten episodes but the quality of them is superb. I will definitely be preordering the 2nd season! It's definitely not a show you want to watch with the kids around with all the blood and gore and sex, but well worth the buy!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Kept me reading... very good. the author has a way of keeping you interested on the reading that made me enjoy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The charcters were realistic and the story really drew me in. Loved her best friend, Six. Would have given it 5 stars if the beginning wasn't so slow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put this series away. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. I often found myself sneaking away to read more.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|To start, I would like to say that I only watch Tina Fey sporadically. I am not a monster fan, but I do really think she is hilarious. The cover has a sort of gwoman in a manfs worldh sort of feel, and itfs just funny. Therefore, my expectations for this book were pretty high.    I donft want to say the book wasnft funny, because there were several parts of it that were. But it had a much more serious aspect to it that I didnft seem to enjoy. I really like Feyfs dry sense of humor, and you do see that some in the book. But I think I went into it decided that it was going to be side-splitting laughter throughout the entirety, and it just wasnft.    It was moreso about Feyfs rise to fame and accomplishments as a writer. Which is completely fine, if thatfs the book she was intending to write. It just didnft appeal to me, as I didnft necessarily care how she got to where she is now. I just wanted her to entertain me.    There were some truly funny stories in the book (those not dealing with her television show or SNL scripts), and I wanted more of them. I think she lost a lot of hilarity when she began talking about SNL and 30 Rock, at least for me, since Ifve never seen 30 Rock and do not watch SNL regularly, if at all.    Ifm going to give this book s s stars. I almost hate to, as I do enjoy her as an actress/comedienne, but I just couldnft get into it, and it ended very abruptly. I think I would only recommend this for Tina Fey superfans. If you enjoy knowing everything about her professional life, this is the book for you.    If you enjoyed this review, please visit [...] to find others like it!
B000FA5STS|4.0|While not my favorite baldacci book it was still by far a good one to read. I would recommend it.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|i bought this movie as a christmas gift and also recieved it as a gift myself... WE LOVE IT, its hilarious!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't think in all my reading I have read anything so breath taking. You feel like you are right there getting to know these two people with them.  The amount of emotion is indescribable. So well written.  I had goosebumps and my heart stopped I don't know how many times, not to mention the tears shed with these two characters. Absolutely amazing and highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|its fun but I have played better games. thats why i give it a 4 1/2 out of 5--but it is definitely in my top 5!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is addictive &amp; alot of fun but it seems like you need to spend money to really play..it's one thing to pay for extras but this is really set up to force you to pay for peanuts-they really should find a better balance with that. It's really a shame because the game is a lot of fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was looking for a new app on my tablet when I saw flow. it was free so I down loded it. After the first level I was addicted. now I am on the two last packs 9&times;9. I am very good at flow even though sometimes I need to get a hint. I really DO think you should be able to earn the hints instead of buying them. but I still do love Flow! :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app. It works just fine on my kindle fire HD. I like the fact that I can see how much battery life I have left to play music or watch a movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because I babysit a lot and the kids I babysit love this game because they love horses
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love it you can always make new styles and save your photos to share and laugh at.this is a good game for all ages not just for children .it's worth the money trust me!
B0095T3H2U|2.0|It had a few funny moments in it, but I found that it just lagged on and on. It became very boring to me. I ended up falling asleep while watching it. I only do that when a movie doesn't hold my interest.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A good easy read, I enjoyed how short it was. A book that often got right down to the point throughout the book. I recommend this book for everybody who likes life lessons. I won't give it 5 stars because it is not as good in my opinion to many other life lesson stories.
B00005JNEW|5.0|One of the greatest football films ever!!!  It is the utopia of high-school football with the reality of adulthood lurking in the shadows.  It's just too bad that the film had to ignore the racism and reality of what really happened to Boobie Miles in real life.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I'm in school an I use this app it just so easy cause now I don't have carry a lot of my books just my kindle
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A real life scenario in our society today. A life changing example of the power of prayer and of God working in our lives.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked it because  he could remember being in his mom's belly.they all are funny Rowley,Gregory,Abigail,his mom,his dad,and his brothers.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game I believe could be played by all ages and enjoyed.  My grandson is the one who showed the game to me and I love it.
B008J34466|5.0|She is bomb and truthful. I love this girl. Always have from her first CD. Keep up the good work Pink.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|The Hunger Games takes place in the next 10 years. A race of human clown people take over the world. The regular people must pay for their resistance with 'tribute' 20 year olds from each of the world's 10 districts. The tributes are sent by chochoo train, and trained over a week, becoming ninja killers. Over the next week  the ninjas are realeased into a 12 ring circus to duel and dance and sing for the audience like American idol until one is declared a winner. The two best fall in love and go home, winners of the world!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Don't let your young kids see this one but everyone else should.  A lot of Cussing but if you don't mind that, watch it.
1575666286|5.0|My husband and I watched a few documentaries about this therapy, so the book is for more in-depth research. It is a very impressive read.
B00AZG6E3Q|5.0|I can not understand why anyone would complain about this show it is awesome. Unlike every other show that makes you watch 12 episodes of a show before something happens, AHS1 and 2 constantly has something to keep your attention. Yes the 1st season was the best but season 2 is still amazing. As for people complaining about the horror, goriness, scariness, or darkness of the show, its called American HORROR Story.
B00AE2J93I|5.0|This was a very funny movie, has a Shrek like humor to it, but still child appropriate. I would watch it again.
1439107955|5.0|Couldn't put it down once started!  What a story!  Successes and dead-ends, good and evil, it's all here, unraveled.  Especially interesting to anyone with cancer, or close to one with it.  Helps you understand the whats, wheres and whys of what's happened and is happening now.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I really thought this was going to be a pretty cheesy movie just from the theme. Everyone has vampire fever, but this was a surprising really great movie. No sparkly vampires here, and a pretty cool altered history.
6305882592|5.0|Funny, sad, touching-- and so many emotions of old and young displayed here.  Many hilarious episodes, played so well by these two!  Great acting, great movie.  Loved it in the 70's, love it now!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I stayed up most of a couple nights to find out how they got the panther. My first DeMille book. I'll buy more.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Great music (I actually like that the actors are really singing their own parts, even if they're not professional voices)!  Hokey, funny, fun, it made me cry at times.  Mother-daughter relationships, times of loss and remorse, joy--in general just a great movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy this series.  We look forward to each new episode as they come.  Great acting
0312430000|5.0|Great writing, and really good ideas for excellence in many different areas (focused on health care delivery).  Every doctor, PA, NP, nurse--all should read it (others too)!
0062218867|3.0|I love Vimes; I love all of the City Watch characters. This book read much differently from others in the series, though. There seemed to be an unusually excessive (for Pratchett) amount of dialogue, more than in any Disc World novel I've read. It wasn't bad dialogue, just a different style of prose than what I've come to expect from Sir Terry. And surprisingly, Death was totally absent, despite there being a few excellent opportunities for his toothy grin to add to the story. By the end I felt as though I was reading a heroic farewell to Vimes, a tale written to ensure his legacy as a hero is enhanced and secured. It made me sad to think that I may have read my last Vimes/City Watch story. A good read, but radically different from other Disc novels.
0061730335|5.0|I read this after visiting Malawi last year, and seeing the grinding poverty there first-hand.  This bright kid just happened to get noticed, and then things he never dreamed of unfolded sequentially!  I wish him all the best in the future, and to never forget what and where he came from.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This movie's biggest drawback was mostly that it was a sequel, so they didn't take the time to develop the plot more. Regardless, it was an interesting movie with a good pace.
0439023513|3.0|I wanted to give this book two stars. In fact, I was dead set on it until page 388. It was then that Suzanne Collins finally gave me a reason to care about the characters again, after what seemed like an eternity. The ending, it was simple and beautiful and made up for pages of me wishing that the story would just go ahead and end and that a surprise 3rd party would show up and nuke the rebels and Capitol out of existence. Page 388 saved this book for me. I wish it hadn't taken so long, though. At least it's over. I can now move on with my life.
0547884591|5.0|I have been cooking for my whole life.  And I have been hacking my mind since I was a teen.  Tim Ferris takes cooking and mind hacking to a whole new level with the 4 hour chef.  If you aren't sure, get the kindle version.  It's less expensive, but it is also SEARCHABLE.  If you are a fan, just dive in and get them both.  You will be amazed at the insights that Tim shares.  Well worth the read.
1442337966|5.0|Rhonda Byrne does it again. This CD is an easy way to brush up on the principles reviewed in the original DVD and book. Wonderful!
B008XCM18Q|4.0|Robert did a good job here, but not great compared to his second book in the series.  To be honest, I could have skipped book one, and started with book two, which is much better written.<br /><br />What I enjoyed best was the depth of the charecters, compared to the movie of the same title.  What I was let down by, was simple stuff that showed he didn't do his research - about firearms.  Small details, but if they were researched just a bit, would have made a much better read.  Still worth 4 stars, just because it's Bourne.
B0086700CM|3.0|Not a bad Kindle Fire edition for the younger crowd.<br />It takes some getting used to it, and is a bit fast for some of us,<br />on the Kindle Fire touch screen.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Really enjoyed this installment.  i am old enough to remember Viet Nam and the LA riots on TV.  I also like old mysterys put to rest.  I got hooked on Harry Bosh many years ago.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It is awesome!  My grandson. And I play it constantly!  The traffics are perfect!  Glad I bought it! I love the characters!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun and enjoyable game to pass the time. The graphics are good and the options are easy to change. I recommend this game for those who are looking for a fun way to spend some time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are great, especially on the kindle. They were so easy to read I could not put them down.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|It's hard to remake a good sci-fi film so I try to give remakes the benefit of the doubt. Some remakes are better than the original, but not this one. This film appeared to be created by removing everything that was interesting in the original and adding story content that defies common sense.<br />Even if I had never seen the first film, this film was visually lacking, for starts. It might as well have been shot in black and white. The characters lacked depth and the premise of the story just left me confused. I did not understand the political situation that led to a train commute through the planet.<br />I recommend you go back to the original film and skip this remake.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|These books are great, especially on the kindle. They were so easy to read I could not put them down.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This is simply an enjoyable film with a great cast. Sometimes surprising, sometimes touching, often funny. Set in India, it's about a group of people who end up at a residential hotel and like it or don't for many different reasons. These are some of the best actors in the world. Sit back with a glass of tea and have fun.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|These books are great, especially on the kindle. They were so easy to read I could not put them down.
B005LAII80|2.0|I couldn't get into the story because there was not enough story between the hyper-violent action scenes. That much violence needs a lot of story and character to support it and this film just did not have solid story or character. The casting was good, the actors were good. The visuals were good. The story just was not there. I like Dredd, the character, and his world, and it should inspire great story. This story would have been appropriate for a video game - just one fight after another. Then the ending left me wondering.<br />I was very disappointed in this film.<br />There was one thing I did like about the film - there were colors. Most of the sci-fi action films of late are grayscale with touches of brown. This film used color like an old comic book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|These books are great, especially on the kindle. They were so easy to read I could not put them down.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|great graphics for future games. the other hungry hade no point in playing but this proved me wrong an I would pay $0.99 for this app
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unpredictable story...I loved that I couldnt put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be surpised.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album is bewitching beyond words. It has this ethereal air about it with a sound that can't be found anywhere else.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|See above. The best show on television. Period. Action, suspense, lots of twists and turns. I Cannot wait until February!!!!!
0817439390|5.0|Bought this as a present and that person loved it - quite interesting book for an average to skillful photographer
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|So I never could get it to connect with the the, but I noticed the app said it supported Dlna, which I thought thought the ps3supported. So I launched app, and on the ps3 went to search media server under videos, and it found my phone! Now I never could get it to show my pics or videos I took with my phone, but videos I had downloaded worked just fine - even 1080p videos. Copied several to my ps3.<br /><br />Also all streaming video worked.<br /><br />Needs several bug fixes, but seems to work fairly well. Its a 3 star now. After some big fixes and better documentation I will update my score
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This novel was recommended by my granddaughter.  I enjoyed it.  It is the first by Sparks that I have read.  The story kept my interest, but I didn't find it to be particularly well-written.  Thus, my rating, good but not great.  Recommended for younger female readers.  Three stars.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|The movie is great! The animation is gorgeous. The story is not as full and enjoyable as some other Pixar movies, but it's still far and above most other animated film offerings.<br /><br />**Important**<br /><br />Young viewers under the age of ten may find the scenes with the bears scary!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was well written.<br /><br />There were some parts that lost my attention but then there were parts that I really enjoyed
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|After reading all the positive reviews I thought I would give this a try. But I was really let down. I like Karl Urban from Star Trek but his character was boring in Dredd.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you have never seen Downton Abby just watch one and you'll be hooked. This by far is my favorite show.
6304539282|4.0|So happy to get a box set that didn't cost me tons of money and doesn't have a bunch of super updated scenes. Excuse me you can't replace Alec Guiness with Ethan Hawke at the end of the movie Mr. Lucas. The box was a little crushed around the corners, but over all pretty great.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  I got hooked as well. Well done, great acting and tons of humor and intrigue.  Very enjoyable.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch, and the special effects were pretty stunning. It's not everyday you see a Vampire throw a horse at Abe Lincoln and it looks decent. I've loved Timur Bekmembatov because he is the king for crazy effects and wonderfully crazy scenes. This movie does not disappoint. I'll probably have to actually purchase it soon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thrilling. One of Grishams best. Keep me guessing. Liked it that they all go to go free in the end.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is suspensful, creative, and heartwarming. The first book in a long time to actually bring a tear to my eyes. Would absolutely recommend this book .
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I am so excited about the show. It has become my all time favourite series I look forward to Sunday night just so I can watch it
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Didn't and still haven't got into the zombie craze. This book takes a look at the human element of something so wild as reanimated corpses. I liked it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This has turned out to be one of my favs I can't believe how funny it is . Great series
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't stop reading until I was finished. Very entertaining! Best book I've read in awhile. Very well written. Definitely worth the read.
0765325950|4.0|I've been listening to the Audiobook version of the Wheel of Time and enjoying it thoroughly.  The pace isn't as fast a if i was reading, but is still fast enough. I'm only at Chapter 32, but it has been good so far.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is perfect for someone who is interested in building a bigger, leaner, stronger body, yet has no real knowledge of how to do it. It takes you through the two big components, diet and exercises, in an easy to understand manner with a great amount of depth. I've been following my program for 10 weeks now and am incredibly happy with my results - I've lost 8kg and made great strength gains. I'm looking forward to starting bulking in a month or two.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very interesting, a fast read and very helpful in personal life.  Fascinating for anyone who would like to change something about themselves.
B007TK77QE|3.0|This is familiar JK style of writing, descriptive and a  familiiarity of characters.  The story moves through the details of the various lives of these unlikeable, dissatisfied, and self centred characters.  I did not connect or empathise with any of the characters so really didn't invest in their journey, so the unsatisfying ending kind of felt satisfying.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always liked this game. Time goes by fast when playing it. I would recommend this game to everyone who loves cards.
B008476HBM|5.0|What can one say regarding this all time classic.  One cannot help but enjoy the vexations and joys of the Bennet family.
B005LAII94|5.0|INTENSE MOVIE BY THE WAY...ARRIVED EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AND IN PRISTINE SHAPE. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS SITE TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR DVD'S.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|The item came much earlier than expected. Product is in a good shape although not the best with some dents in the corners. Probably due to the overly large packaging and very little or no protection hence resulting in freeplay within the packaging box.<br /><br />Overall quite pleased with the service, but do post a note to the shipping department especially for international shipping orders. Cannot 100% ensure no rough handling with forwarders, but at least do some preventive measures.<br /><br />Still, I am satisfied with the product and the services rendered.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! I love horse games and this is one of the best I have played in a long time! Virtual animal games like this need to be made more often!!
1401238580|5.0|you get a freakin mask. . . . .. . .. . .. . . .. . .. . .
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I like the movie for several reasons:<br /><br />Good story line<br />Good fighting<br />Hot actors<br /><br />Yes, I wish the ending had a little more to it, but I enjoyed this film very much.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book is awesome it keeps you engrossed the institute time all the way till the end. I love it. By far one or the best love stories I have read.
B000EUDAWG|3.0|I enjoy using this, I scared a lot of people.<br />It just glows and looks really fake. It sucks at moving in carpet, only good on hard floor.<br />It's okay, and still works.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|You get tricked into spending all of your gems and the &quot;easy&quot; items that aren't supposed to require any preparation still do. It other than that the game is pretty good.
B000ICM5VW|1.0|Really disappointed. The movie would not play at all, I have know idea why, but it just would not work.<br />I tried my Blue- ray player and even my ps3.
B00APACSJG|4.0|good confusion for those who are trying to out with the main character miles. so another miles action packed story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome! I love how you can get millions of points and play lots of games! but still.. its awesome.<br /><br />@yellowjacket
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|enjoyable read from a great author with action and abit of complex romance so any person who reads this auther will enjoy
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|We enjoyed the movie. Was adventurous and filled with twists.  Was easy to access. Would definitely watch it again. Thanks
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|He is just the cutest thing I've ever seen! Flash replaced Mr Cuddles as my favorite! But if he's a robot, can't he just have his own jet pack and fly up to the coins?
B005FISBTO|5.0|This series just keeps getting stronger and better. It's filmed well, quality actors, beatiful scenery. . . what else could ask for?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoy every single book he has published I hope to read more in the future and am looking forward to the next book.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I haven't watched the dvd's yet, but we watched the entire series as it aired and were absolute devotees. Costumes, sets, charecters; this book series and now the television series are written well and really well done.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Was good as a whole I would have ended it differently can't wait for next movie to come out on disk
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I loved the books and now I love the series. Showtime does a great job, and every actore fits the part.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|THREAT VECTOR (Jack Ryan)  Fascinating, but long.  Technology is very complex for this computer-challenged reader.  It gives sometimes frigthtening insights into the perils of being in politics.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Everyone enjoyed this movie. From us old fogie grandparents, to the seven year old grandaughter. As with the others in this series, the morals are strong and the humor is both banana peel and sly
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This is a great CD! It's hard to believe how good these artists are! Can't wait for the next one.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|If you read nothing else all year, this should be the one you do.  Well written, imaginative, illusory, unpredictable, real.
B005N95JA4|5.0|Some Girls is one of my favorite Stones album, I had great expectations to hear cd number 2. I've heard some of this songs before on bootlegs but nothing compares with a good sound.  I was surprised with \\"So Young\\" it was released on a \\"B side\\" on \\"voodoo lounge\\" era, so I was wonder how it sounds in 1978, but are the same vocals!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Hilarious. It's not Christmas until you watch Elf! This movie will cheer up anyone, even the grumpiest Scrooge in the world.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is responsible for some lost sleep! I simply had to know how it ended, even though I had to get up for work in the morning. This was a very well written book that kept me engaged until the very end. A very good &#34;suspense&#34; book!
B009AJDET6|5.0|This very reasonably priced boxed set contains all the Rhino remasters of CTA, II, III, V (IV is the remastered live At Carnegie Hall,), VI, VII, VIII, X (IX was their first Greatest Hits), XI and Hot Streets, the first post-Kath album.  The sound and CD labels are the same as those of the Rhino remasters, along with the bonus tracks found on some albums.<br /><br />What you do not get are any of the remastered edition booklet notes, album credits or photos.  The albums are in paper sleeves with facsimile covers of the original albums.  I'm personally more interested in the music, so it's all good.<br /><br />I'd probably deduct half a star for Hot Streets, the only Kath-less album found here, which is good only for use as a drink coaster, as lead guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath's absence and an immediate dip in quality are apparent. Kath was the heart and soul of the band, a once in a lifetime talent never to be replaced.  I honestly wish they'd have shut down shop after he tragically died.  Hot Streets finds the band losing the tough blues of the Kath years and immediately slipping into the MOR Adult Contemporary schlock they've been pedaling since (see my review of the second box containing Chicago 13 through XXX for what I'm talking about).  I wish they'd have swapped out Hot Streets for Chicago IX, the first greatest hits package.  Sure it repeats several tracks and some of the shortened single edits appear on the remastered albums they came from, but it's most of the key hit singles from the Kath era.  That's actually not a bad idea: selling Hot Streets and replacing it with IX....<br /><br />For someone interested in getting the amazing studio Kath-era Chicago albums in one reasonably priced collection, you can't beat this set!  Order this and the Carnegie Hall live set you'll have all the Chicago you'll ever need.  Even Robert Lamm has gone on record saying &#34;CTA through XI is the the real Chicago.&#34;
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such a page turner! I would recommend it to anyone that wants to be immersed in a book for a few days.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Any new music from Donald Fagan is a treat. There has been some grumbling but I think those who want to live in his past greatness, should enjoy those masterpieces there. This kind of talent is in dwindling supply and I relish when time proven artists (who don't owe us anything more) show their generosity.<br />OK, so lets do a review: I feel that if you have liked the last trilogy offerings then you should like this one. The arrangements are rich and beautifully orchestrated; the lyrics are clever and thoughtful. The selections are narratives - generally told first person. Slinky thing is the story of an older man who is privileged to be dating a younger woman. Problem is the world judges him about this and he suffers insecurity. Can he hold on to that slinky thing? One of my early favorites: The Weather In My Head.  -  Deals with the trauma our narrator suffers from the emotional fallout that accompanies his difficult relationship. (Probably with the aforementioned girlfriend.)<br />That's enough interpretation, part of the charm of this music is: TOU decide for yourself what these masterpieces mean - To You.<br />Just buy the CD. You wont regret it - Donald Fagan Is a Genius!!!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Great free Pacman!! Easy to play & fun! And its free!! Great deal !! A good game for everyone - phone or tablet!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|excellent app very useful<br />helps me manage my kindle and is accurate and necessary I Don' t know what else to say, twenty words are more than I can think of.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Although a little cryptic in the beginning, The movie holds your interest and moves along a good pace.  The stunt work is excellent and not totally unbelievable as it is in some acton flicks.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I bought as a Christmas present for my family. it is filled with Love ,Hope & Optimism.WIth some surprises too.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|It is what  it is.  It's a  carrying case.  I don't think  it offers much protection if it  should be dropped.  It could use an outside pocket to accommodate the screen cloth.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I can't travel the whole world and see everything beautiful and majestic and mysterious in nature -- but this series can take me to most of it!  Beautifully filmed and coordinated.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great book.  Kept me on the edge of my chair.  Many twists and turns. you must read it!
B0000DZTIW|3.0|Good music, but not enough of it.  The moving passages should be stretched out or repeated.  A 2-hour movie should have a longer sound-track.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I was ready to hate this movie. Or, at least, find it stupid. But I was very surprised that after watching it as a rental from Amazon (a whole other story), I went online and bought the DVD.<br /><br />While the story is typical; ET drops in uninvited and starts raising hell, military (right down to the feisty latina and her big machine gun) kicks alien's butts and we all live happily ever after. But the way it is presented is the best I have seen in a while. Acting was pretty good, couple of tear jerking scenes, but special effects were great without being overwhelming.<br /><br />Overall, a very good, very entertaining movie. Definitely worth at least a rental even if you don't buy it.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Hitchcock at his best:  suspense, humor, style, and charisma.  The versatile Cary Grant, the beautiful Grace Kelly, and a wonderful supporting cast.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Pretty impressive app for all the art &amp; photo I do on the kfire. I use 4 other apps also (nobody has everything I want) but I use picsart the most by far. A little hard to figure out at first but once you get going it's way cool-- lotsa options, + frequent updates.
B005DI9906|4.0|Good movie.<br />PROS:  I appreciate the lack of over-the-top stuff that was in the Heath Ledger version of a few years back.  Much of the movie was relatively true to the book, and it did highlight and ridicule the precision/tradition of the British military and the nobility of being killed in battle.<br />CONS:  The blindness could have been better acted, and the last ten minutes lacked the drama I would have liked.  I wish the violin music had been included!  I wish the reunion of Harry and Ethne had been truer to the book, and I thought the ending was a little to cute.<br />Overall, I am glad I own it, but it still doesn't fully satisfy.  I guess no version will fully capture the beauty of the novel.
B004I744AS|5.0|Any words that I look up are found in the Free Dictionary - even veterinary vocabulary!  I use it on my phone and Kindle.  Deserves the 5 star rating.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|I have been a fan of Franz since Take me Out first aired, but it seems they took a hiatus for a while where I didn't hear much that I liked.  Pandora brought me a few songs off this album that turned my head, and buying the whole CD was definitely the way to go.  There's not a bad song on here.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I loved this game but for some reason once I hit level 10 it started over. I'm going to keep playing because I loved the game but if that happens again I'll just quit.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|After several attempts at modifying  printer settings and visits to the HP web site the configuration is still a 'Mystery Of Life'.  Never was able to find the printer pin or email address.  I could be that my WIFI printer is not configurable, who knows.  There must be another printer app that will allow printing on my home WIFI network work.  The price was right but at this point trying to use was not a good use of my time.  HP could improve the documentation on the web site and should include a list of models that can use this app.
B0031RS58I|4.0|...what if you had no memory of the last few years, and the &#34;old you&#34; woke up in your current life?  Would you be surprised?  Would your life be what you expected?<br />We all have dreams about the kind of person we will become when we &#34;grow up&#34;. This book explores priorities, family, friendship, power, and loft-style-living in a way that makes you think, but not too much!  Mostly I laughed out loud at Lexi's adventures, with a few tears along the way.<br /><br />An enjoyable read for Kinsella fans, or those who just enjoy good chick lit (that is, chick lit with a non-romantic main storyline!)
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box.  Great writer.  I always look forward to his books as they always hold your interest and you can't wait to see what happens next.
B0050KU3IY|4.0|A great follow up to Something Borrowed... See Darcy's point of view, and follow her as she figures out what's important.  Not as pregnancy-focused as I thought it would be (a good thing, from my perspective), with more focus on Darcy's inner monologue, priorities, and relationships with friends and family.<br /><br />Picks up where the last book left off (with a little crossover), but would be just as enjoyable if you had not read the first book, or if you just watched the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a good way to keep up with news and pictures of grandchildren, cousins, etc. & to just keep in touch with family & friends.
B002SJKWZ4|3.0|Girlfriend is a HUGE Harry Potter fan. Bought her this and prayed that she dug it. In an hour she had programmed the thing on her own and  tries to use if as often as she can.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|Very cute and funny. The graphics were nice and the daily little tasks were creative. Something fun for everyone, Christmastime or not. I absolutely cannot wait for the next part!
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It is a fun, cheesy  80s musical. Catherine Zeta Jones singing &#34; Hit Me With Your Best. Shot&#34; ...A lot of Foreigner music. Typical plot.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|lee child has become my most favorite author. The jack Reacher character is greatlooking forward for the next book, when?
B000IZ6URY|5.0|This movie is so funny. Its very creative, using dolls as the characters. It does mock on all borders of several cultures and societies.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Amazing second book!! I just couldn't put it down and every page made it event more exciting!! Definitely worth the read and an interesting twist to a great character!!!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game! there's so many animals to collect and they're sooo cute! I'm still working out how to get neighbors, but aside of that I just had to rate this 5 stars!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This was well written story, it read as if was the biography of a young man life story. I appreciated how he observed the behavior of the animals which was very captivating. I appreciated the faith and courage of Pi, wanting to know if he\\"'ll survive, what would Richard Parker do to him if he could his control over him. I never saw the movie and if I do I hope it's as good as the book version..5 stars
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Looking forward for more from this duo. Jonathan has an incredibly good voice and Charlotte is good too, although I think her voice sounds different than when she sang on BGT. Buy this you won't be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first two books I thought I knew exactly what would happen in this one. I was so wrong and happy to be. I did feel that there was just something I needed to read or that I missed by the end of the book which is the only reason for 3 stars. The ending just felt slapped together and didn't really leave me satisfied :( great series though...
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is a cute story. Predictable, funny. some times our best plans don't work out, but they work out for the best
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wasn't sure about this book but I am so grateful that I did read it. A very good book and so worthwhile!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|it is everything i remembered it to be from seeing it live with my Father growing up!! It is WONDERFUL!!
B000002KXV|5.0|Every song is great, don't wanna skip any! One of my fav Steely Dan recordings. Yes I said Steely Dan, because Donald is the group in a nutshell. Great price and speedy delivery make for an overall happy purchase.
142311339X|5.0|R. Riordan's series provide young readers an opportunity to enmesh themselves in the very confusing world of the \\"who's who?\\" In Greek & Roman mythology. Well done.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Enjoyed this episode very much. Overall true to the book except for the children who  appear much older than the kids in the book. Didn't give it 5 stars because of the overall quality of the HD transmission, which was blurry at times. Again just finished the first book, am on the second, and so far the series seems spot on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best app ever!!! Me and my bff LOVE horses and we will always love horses!p.s. this app is so awesome!
B008HK3TXK|5.0|This case is great! Nice & slim; cute and stands well. Easy to get to charging plug. I'm very glad I chose this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|touching, realistic fiction - could not put it down.  Might be a little intense for younger teens, but recommend to older teens and adults.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.  It was long but worth it to read.  I liked what the characters wanted from Oz. (Age 8)
0783226845|5.0|Great performance by Al Pacino. Powerful delivery in his classic speech about character. My next favorite part, the tango lesson. It's one of those movies I don't mind watching again from time to time, which is a good thing, since it is one of my husband's favorite movies.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child does a great job of capturing your attention and keeping you involved.  Jack Reacher has to be John Wayne's secret son....
B004JMZPJG|4.0|This is a decent, well made case that is large enough for most digital long zooms and modern DSLR's w/medium telephoto lenses. The holster bag has two slipcase style side pockets and some padding (thin, but will provide some protection). For the price I paid, it's a deal.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I have only watched the first 2, the transfer is very good best I've seen, the first Rocky was made in 1976, so I didnt expect a miracle, but the picture is pretty good, the sound is awesome..Rocky II 1979, i didnt expect a miracle with this either, better picture, sound good also..I really look fwd to seeing Rocky III that one is my very favorite..i have always enjoyed them all, I will finally get to see Rocky 5 in its entirety, and I have never seen Rocky Balboa. I dont consider 43.55 alot of money either for these 6 films and bonus<br />material.
B002APU580|5.0|Amazon was quick to deliver my second movie ... even during the busy Holy-days.  I think the cost was fair.  I had a chance to share my movie with Family members while they were visiting during this beautiful season of giving.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|FANTASTIC,  THE ACTORS ESPECIALLY ARE SO GOOD, THE  CINEMATOGRAPHY  IS GREAT, THE PICTURES BEINGCREATED REAL ART IN MY OPINION SHAKESPEARIAN STORY SETI N THE GUTTER OF THE MOB
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Drawn into a story that delivers unexpectedly. Pi is a character you want to sit down with over tea or hear lecture in a great hall.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love finding new things to do and to make. The ideas for parties, new baby, photography and holidays are my favorite.
