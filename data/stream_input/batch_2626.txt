B0062QRTKA|5.0|Ignore the stick-in-the-muds (super religious and super atheist people) and enjoy the game! It's a fun game app that is both challenging and funny! It made me laugh and grit my teeth at the same time. The graphics are cute and are just fine for me (I have definitely seen some ugly ones before!).<br /><br />If you enjoy playing game apps, definitely try out this one! Haters gonna hate but for everyone else out there- lighten up and live! :)
1616550414|5.0|If you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series, you no doubt need to get this book. Not only does it go in depth about the timeline but it has some amazing artwork and concept art for the games as well.
B008K9UZY4|1.0|Controls are not fit to be used mobile. Perhaps with some of the new controllers available for mobile. GS3. Running 4.2
B0086HGW42|5.0|I'm in love with Ed Sheerans music, the way he writes a song is unbelievable. I love every song on here but my favorite is kiss me, all time favorite song of all time. He's a great artist and im definitely waiting for his next album.
B0031QVW2U|2.0|I'm very tall and I don't like how the product is held in place. Wont be using it and will be looking to sell.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|Purchased this for older brother, and is working above expectations. Easy to use and to hook up. Was recommended by ear doctor.
1440503257|5.0|Harry's unofficial cook book is delightful. It fits well with the &#34;official&#34; Harry books and is no poor cousin. The recipes are great and remind me of many my mother made us as children growing up in New Zealand. As New Zealand is a member of the British Commonwealth we tend to use a lot of the British recipes, along with Irish and Scottish recipes' also. I will be making jam tarts soon, but will by pass the mashed parsnips. They were never my favourite vegetable growing up. Anyone who has an interest in cooking or has children or grandchildren, will have fun teaching them to cook out of this book, A big thanks to Dinah Bucholz for the book and to Amazon for featuring this vendor, Yourbookstore. I will purchase here again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Endless fun &amp; challenges.  Wish there were more!  I really enjoyed how absorbing it was -- guess I'll just have to pay attention to the husband &amp; kids instead!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|The fight sequences were really well done, as were chase scenes.  The story telling was just 'ok', but I wasn't expecting much anyway.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for children and adults alike. It's a great movie to include the entire family. Grab a bowel of popcorn and you will watch this show over and over and over.
193700788X|2.0|This final Sookie Stackhouse book was way too mild.  It seems the author is tired and simply coasted through the final details of Sookie's life.  I was three quarters of the way through the novel and suddenly realized it wasn't going to get better.  I kept reading to the end and felt disappointed.  I plan to reread  the Sookie books because she's so enjoyable but I probably will not open the final book again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|too many of you people are judgmental<br />just because it is similar to harry potter doesn't mean it's bad :o(<br />i personally loved the book and can't wait to read the next one. :D
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|great movie love it , it's almost as good as the book almost great picture world suggest this movies to anyone.
B008602KQI|3.0|I was disappointed that there wasn't real games about being hungry. I thought for sure this was going to have a hot dog eating contest or a watermelon seed spitting contest. Not even the old stand-by pie eating contest? what kind of hunger games are these? They should have called it kill games or murder games or search and destroy games so we would know what we are getting.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|it was so not worth my time, it took forever to get going was slow moving and just one of the worst movies I've seen in a while .
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Just watch it. You'll see. Don't trip on the time travel. It's good for you. Live long and prosper. Done.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|These books have a lot of blood for my taste - usually. That said, it is a compelling read. Couldn't put it down.I haven't seen the television version yet, but I plan to get it on DVD. Not sure how closely it follows the books, but I am anxious to see it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|IT IS VERY RELAXING, IS EASY TO USE. COLORS ARE JUST ABOUT RIGHT, IT IS GREAT WHEN Y0U  ARE WAITING FOR A OFFICE VISIT.
1616550414|5.0|This is has all the info you would need to know about LoZ. Its great for folks who want to know the whole story of LoZ.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Good to see a new/different story on film all though we all know the story.  acting was expected. Kinda cheesy but overall was just an okay movie.
B005U9REFA|5.0|Another flick from my youth that I shared with my 3 daughters on family movie night.They loved it and almost all the characters. David Bowie is the Goblin King! So of course the soundtrack is AMAZING!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Coming from a background of having never read a Sherlock book or watched a Sherlock movie, I was worried I might be lost in a modern day adaptation but that could not be further from the truth. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freemen bring Holmes and Watson alive and square into the 21st century. The shows are fun to watch and keep you hooked to the very last moment. Highly recommend to anybody who is looking for a wonderful show with terrific actors.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite of all the books so far. Such a good story line and ends perfectly! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great book
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This woman is so talented.  The CD is very impressive with the lyrics and music.  We heard some of her songs on the radio but we knew we had to have this CD to hear ALL her songs.  Will be enjoyable to listen to for years and years.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun but it cost a lot of energy to practice and you can get better horses until it stops at the rainbow unicorn
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Great CD.  I would recommend this to all my friends and family but they've already purchased it.  Music, words, singing style is perfection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game and it's really fun to like own and take care of your own horse.  Easier for people who are older.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never liked non fiction books, just partway through chapter 1 of the first book I was hooked! Loved them all.
B007SGM084|5.0|it took me 2 days to read this trilogy and I couldnt put it down or walk away from it
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This is one of Quentin's films that make you scratch your head and wonder how he comes up with some of the content?  The way this movie pits stereotypes against each other in certain situations is ingenious.  My favorite would be the introduction of Samuel L. Jackson (playing an Uncle Tom) to Jamie Foxx who in this scene is pretending to play the part of an Uncle Tom.  Every time I watch this movie I find at least one part that I didn't fully catch the last time around.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Enjoyed it very much!  If you like CIA novels, this one is excellent.  Very entertaining, riveting and easy to read.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|If you like the unpredictable style of Director Quentin Tarantino then this movie is a must see.  It is brutally violent for an appropriately gruesome back story that shouldn't ever be funny, yet he still finds humor and incorporates it into this movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Total spam.  Cannot get read of suggested friends (PEOPLE WHO I DO NOT KNOW AND WILL NOT KNOW EVER)  My friends should first and suggested on site with possibility to delete. I do not need their picture and story of their life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have played many versions of this game.  This one is neat!  I just recently downloaded it onto my brand new Kindle Fire HD.  I like how you can just tap the cards and they automatically move to the correct place.  Love the card backs and background choices.  Good version.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is an amazing read by Markus Zusak. He truly put his best work out there while writing this!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST HOG, I HAVE PLAYED SEVERAL OTHERS LIKE IT AND I LOVE THIS STORY LINE TOO. I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE GAMES ALIKE. THANKS
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  It has multiple storylines that intertwine and you can feel great sympathy for the characters in a changing world.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is a very faithful rendition of the Fitzgerald book that captures well its characters and the point about the apparently pervasive irresponsibility of the very wealthy.  Daisy is the central character and it is hard to imagine any other but the Farrow version.  Very faithful to the spirit of the book.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Based on pre-release reviews, I was expecting a return to QOTSA's prime, but this album failed to meet the pre-release hype. My God is the Sun is the highlight, most of the rest is worthy as filler on a Desert Sessions disc.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My favorite Doctor and companion, even if some of the stories are less than excellent.  Their interactions are the best.
B008ROG1QI|5.0|This film gets your attention right from the start.  Good acting and very realistic film work.  Recommend this for anyone interested in WWII aviation.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I love Hitchcock movies. They are much like an Edgar Allan Poe poem or story-- well-crafted, captivating, stylistic. With som much schlock out there, it's nice to pop a Hitchcock film into the DVD player and spend an afternoon with the master of suspense. That's why I wanted to see this movie.<br /><br />Hitchcock, the man, was complicated and flawed, a man obsessed with a certain image of womanhood that he used again and again in his movies. And he was a bear of a director. Anthony Hopkins brings Hitchcock to life and does a marvelous job of capturing his essence. Helen Mirren as the wife shows the other side of Hitchcock that few of us were privy to-- a woman who understood the man she was married to, awoman who probably would have had her own successful career in Hollywood in another time, and a woman who was partnered with a man of genius who gave strength to that genius.<br /><br />This is the tale of Psycho-- how it came about, how it came to be made. Hopkins captures the man obsessed with his falling star and his need to save himself financially by re-inventing himself and the movies in the process. Constrained by the movie censors, he crafts one of the most suspenseful horror tales captured on film and he does it masterfully. But that mastery doesn't come easily and that's what this movie reveals-- the man behind the movie and the woman behind the man.<br /><br />Watching his movies and then listening to the behind-the-scenes commentary by associates and his daughter, it's easy to get a feel for the man. But this movie does a better job of revealing the real man-- flawed and driven by ego, reined-in by a wife who may be more partner now than wife, Hitchcock does a great job of showing us that genius is sometimes born of desperation and that fear of failure touches even the great.
0156027321|3.0|Like many others, I read this book when I heard that there was going to be a movie adaptation. I haven't see the movie yet, but I don't get the hype surrounding this book. It's good, but I wasn't blown away.<br /><br />The most famous part of the book is the scene depicted on the cover of a boy stranded in a boat with a tiger. That part of the book is indeed a fascinating survivor's tale. The protagonist, Pi Patel, must use his wits to stave off a tiger after his boat sinks on a cross-Pacific voyage. Yann Martel is very good at showing the young Pi as he confronts the difficult choice to live. Pi must violate some of his previously held beliefs, such as his aversion to killing animals, in order to survive.<br /><br />However, this epic only constitutes the middle half of the book. The beginning 40% or so shows us Pi's life before his ship sank. And it's frankly a bit uneven. Yann Martel tries to make several points about religion and wildlife but it comes across as too forced. Pi isn't a very well developed character. He's depicted as a flaky kid who can't decide on a religion. This setup would have been OK if there had been a great payoff at the end, but there wasn't. The religion stuff only comes up intermittently as Pi occasionally says thanks to several Gods or prophets.<br /><br />The writing gets somewhat repetitive after a while. Yann Martel writes the way people talk, which sometimes adds a layer of realistic but sometimes means we have to read through characters repeating each other's questions for clarification or asking for confirmation. It just seems like filler after a while.<br /><br />Overall, 3.5 stars. I don't read many Young Adult novels but it seems like a decent one. But I wasn't wowed. I got the impression that I was supposed to be wowed by all the talk of religion but it felt shallow. Maybe I'm just not the target audience.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is about something that seems so unbelieveable-- a CIA operative conjures up a hare-brained idea of getting 6 people out of Iran by having them pose as a movie-scouting production crew.<br /><br />And yet it is true.<br /><br />What is so great about this movie is, well, lots of things. The acting is top-notch. This is not a movie of great explosions and shoot-em-ups, but of quiet resolve and purpose. It would be so easy to add a 1,000 megawatt chase scene or some buxom beauty to counter Affleck's star turn, but no. The story is true to the real events, the events aren't glorified or electrified, the people are real. It is a quiet gem of a movie that shows you don't have to make a big action movie to showcase a hero. Argo does it all on its own.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is pretty fun..... it's highly addictive.. Lol... I started playing it on my boyfriend's phone and had to download it to my kindle.
1439102732|5.0|I haven't quite finished reading this but I am enjoying immensely. Picout's characters are powerful and by telling the story from multiple points of view, it becomes that much richer. The whole theme of music and music therapy makes this book particularly interesting.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|I didn't believe OMD could top History of Modern - was I wrong! This may be the best thing they have ever done.  If you are a fan of Kraftwerk, early Depeche, Numan etc., you will not be disappointed. Great album from start to finish.
B009MYAQOA|5.0|Though fictionalized, this story gives a fascinating glimpse into the life--and times--of Frank Lloyd Wright through the eyes of his mistress.  In telling 'her side' of the story, the author also gives one pause for thought about open marriage, parental responsibilities, self-fulfillment v. relationship commitments.  Found myself thinking about the costs of the relationship for a long time after the book was done, which to me is the sign of something well worth reading.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|While the first few episodes seem to lack any real drama, by the middle of the season I was hooked.
0307450570|5.0|Loved this book.  Step by step instructions with lots of photos.  Great reference guide.  I would highly recommend  this book to all who are interested in crafts and creativity.
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|The review is for the record.  Been listening to Black Sabbath for around 40 years now.  Do believe it was the second piece of music that I ever listened to that was not on the radio.  Was at a friends house and his sister had one of those portable record player with the speaker in front.  Friend but Paranoid on and was blown away.  Iron Man dam still remember it.  We always read comic books and Iron Man was one of my favorites.<br /><br />Anyway myself and friends love this album.  The vinyl sounds so sweet.  To me it does have the old Sabbath sound which for me is great I loved that stuff with Ozzy.  To be truthful never really listened to them with any other singer.  All these bands I grew up with including myself are getting old.  I live in New Orleans and was thinking about going up north to see them on tour.  If Bill was playing with them then it would be a no brainier to see the original band.  Don't get me wrong drummer is great its still not the original band though.  Wishing them all the best.  Thanks guys.<br /><br />Oh Yeah I got this record for 25 dollars and now Amazon raised its price to 30.  Come on man wtf.  Oh well they are selling like hot cakes :-)  everywhere else I look they are sold out.  Good for them.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Just great. Laughing out loud and all I could say to explain myself was \\"she is so funny...you have to read this.\\"
B00BUT5IAC|1.0|Are they serious?  The CD sells for 12 dollars.  Please do not support this kind of rip off.  If individuals continue to support this kind of craziness then we will be paying 60 dollars for all vinyl.  Do yourself a favor and get more value for the money.  I love the band and I am sorry but 60 dollars is extreme.  Thanks Black Sabbath for putting out a double LP for 25 dollars.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Each episode makes an emotional connection with me. The actors carry the story perfectly and Stargate SG-1 is the only series that can consistently make me bond, worry, get anxious, laugh and feel good as each episode ends.<br /><br />When I need an emotional boost, I pull up Stargate SG-1.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Iron Man has never been my favorite superhero so this review obviously reflects that.  I was, however, entertained by Robert Downey's wit and weaknesses.  On the flipside, if your eyeballs hurt from looking at Mickey Rourke, as mine do, you might not enjoy his scenes.  As a whole, I liked the first Iron Man much more than this one.  But, if you simply want to be entertained, spend the 2.99 to rent the movie.  I would not recommend owning it.
0785153322|5.0|You can't really go wrong with Iron Man, so I liked very much both books about him. I don't really like the Captain, so I can't really say anything about his book.<br />But the thing here is The Art of Thor. This one is just amazing. The amount of art on Thor himself is huge, and all of them are very beautiful and well-done. There is a painting of Odin riding Sleipnir that I just wish I had it framed on my living room.
B002N14GPE|3.0|Really no comment I love my music I already seen the movie Orphan it's okay just wanted it in my collection
0785168109|5.0|The book was as good as I expected. All the art on the various Iron Man armors are astonishing, I nearly can't believe they are paintings and not computer made.<br /><br />Altough I would like some more art on Pepper, in the final pages there are two paintings on her that seem kind of impressionist, and are among my favorite arts of the book.<br /><br />Simply amazing, you just can't go wrong with this book!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Every song is strong on this album. Arguably the best Accept album. Some of the best Metal of the 80s.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|We're supposed to be repelled by murderers, but the protagonist seems draw us in to secretly egg him on on his mission. It also makes you wonder whether the crimes he committed were so &#34;wrong&#34; in light of his life, talent, and the final work he created...I also enjoyed the confusing ending :)
B0012GMXBK|4.0|Metal Heart, Balls to the Wall and Restless and Wild are the must have Accept albums. This is my least favorite of the three but still a really good album. Accept did some interesting things with the guitar work on this album and a few songs are a little more Scorpions like.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|will have you wondering where your device is, all the time telling yourself &quot;one more time&quot; so clear the schedule
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The book definitely kept you interested and was worth the read like the first one. Good read. It did get slow at some points and its hard to really get into America's feelings. It kind of jumps around a lot in that aspect.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|This is a better movie than Jack the Giant Killer which is a waste of money. Good graphics, plot ok, much better version of the story although still embellished from the original which only had one giant. I guess you can't make a big budget computer graphics movie with only one giant.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked the hidden clues and the level of difficulty.  I would get stuck but not so stuck that I wanted to stop playing.  I wish there were more rooms!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it's. fun sometimes.  the coins regenerate at a good rate.  if you like playing coins you will like this game.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Easy to follow on some ties and not on others<br />Had to go to \\"You Tube\\" for easier to follow pictures on some more difficult ones
B001P06GX4|4.0|Great Game for 4 players. Its a bit dificult to play with 3 players. With 2 players all you have to do is color in with sharpie 3 squares from the edges.
B0042FZWC0|5.0|I'm deliberating what I should be/do when I grow up. This certainly gave a great deal of thought provoking insight. Great writing style, easily comprehensible, deep. BTW, I'm 52 and have created some legacy, but need to do more. Thanks, Chris, for the inspiration.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book was great.  Twists and turns and great mysteries.  Love it!!  I hope she keeps writing.  Can't get enough.
B00BVYJG18|5.0|Don't feel like writing so I'm just going to say buy it, and you will not be disappointed.  Buy it now!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|I like the app well enough its cute playmobil and its pirates what's not to be endeared to. The trouble lies in the message &quot;there is a new update availble in the store would you like to get it now&quot;. Of courese you want an update you want to play the app. I have clicked the app and no update is shown the only option is to reopen the app when you finally load it's back to that troubling message again. I know this sounds like a first world pro lek and all but what is wrong with your app working without messages that are erroneous messages? Get it together people! Work out your bugs before you put an app out if this app is ment for youngsters this might confuse things and make a child not be interested in an otherwise cute, fun, and time consuming game.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I had this on my wish list to buy it later but I was listening to Jillian's podcast yesterday and she said that Ripped in 30 is tons better. 30 Day Shred DVD work out is old and that Ripped in 30 is way more advanced and knowledgeable work out system.<br /><br />I thought it was great that she actually voiced this, coming from the horses mouth, and she acknowledges that her new system workouts are better for getting the results you want. I work out 5 days a week with high intensity and appreciate her honesty. She also recommends to work out 5 days on, 2 days off. Listen to her podcasts (It's free on iTunes!), she truly does want to make your health and fitness better!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Didn't Think I Would Like It But I Did! Love MR. Big! Lol JM I Remember From ER! She's A Good Character And I Love The Plot. I Have Not Finished The Season Yet, But I'm Looking Forward To The Next Season!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book!!!! So good! I would recommend this book to everyone. Anyone could relate to this!! Brilliant, made me laugh and cry! Can't wait to read it again
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Loved this show in the real world there are a lot more cops like Makie and crew than not.. Most cops live on the edge he was crooked but then so are most cops .. When it comes right down to it he had a good heart and took care of business.. Wish it was still on..
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love the encounter between Loki and the Hulk. Cathartic. Iron Man never disappoints. Surprised at how well Captain America fit / led Avengers.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I didn't think I would like this movie, I rented it for my 13 year old daughter.  Suprisingly, it was a really cute and funny movie to watch.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I got this for my grandson, but it is too difficult for him. I bet his dad would love it though
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My whole family looks forward to watching the Walking Dead together every week.  Can't wait for new episodes to come out!
B001L51RQE|5.0|This DVD runs through all the Police music as it was performed through my lifetime. It really refreshes the memory.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game....  waiting for more rooms!!!!  not enough rooms..finished entire app in a day.  kids loved playing it wiith me!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We just started watching NCIS a couple of months ago, starting with the first show of the first season and after finishing Season 9 on DVD, we just had to get the first show of the 10th season to see what happened after the cliffhanger.  Hard as it is, we are waiting to get the DVD's for Season 10 when they come out!  We hope it goes on for 10 more years!!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I like progressive rock, especially the more commercial side ( Kate Bush, peter gabriel, Marillion, coheed and cambria) so I thought I would like this. I was wrong. Very much a pop record. More like an artsy version of U2. The epic piece &#34;exogenesis&#34; isn't all that epic.
B003008RWA|4.0|I am not a fan of Michael Moore because I believe he embellishes his point by telling white lies and half truths to make his oponents look evil...which, in my opinion, makes him just as dishonest as the media. If you can look beyond that, this movie does a great job of exposing what we already suspected (secretly knew) about the state of our healthcare system and politics in the US, but in a palatable Hollywood style that reaches the mainstream audience. This movie made me realize I can no longer sit back and 'hope' our leaders (government) do the right thing to fix what is broken in our country when they created the problems to begin with. It is time for me to stand up and be the change I want to see in the world. Thank Michael!
B005TBN3EU|2.0|The chemistry is still there between the actors or rather the characters, however the overall dialog and &#34;plot&#34; did not seem as funny as the first movie. Judge for yourself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great, but you have to be patient to play it. Also, you can pay money to buy other horses but you can also level up to get the horses you want.
B004C3DLJ8|5.0|one of our kids' favorites, we watch it all the time.  excellent family fun for our Friday night movie night.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was an easy read. I enjoyed the different twists but I would have liked a little more to the ending. Good summer book.
B002KVZBGA|5.0|The new one does not hold a candle to the old one. This one is hilarious while having all the aspects of an action movie. Classic british charm.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|What starts off slow and meditative turns into a series we couldn't stop watching. Excellent!<br />The costumes and sets are also beautiful. Three episodes wasn't enough so we eagerly started<br />watching season 2!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson at his king of pop prime, what else needs to be said?  Worth the money all day long.
B00B10CT7A|5.0|It's difficult to find movies that can be shared with our children these days, but this is one.  It is a beautifully made movie, both with the scenery and the storyline.  It will definitely be one of my all time favorites.
0843175109|5.0|Another classic Mr. Man book, this is my 5 year olds favorite character.  These books are fun to read and always provide a positive message in a funny way.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My husband and I are watching a couple every night before going to bed.  Summer is all re-runs so it's great to be able to watch a series that has sooooo many episodes.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is simply an excellent book. I highly recommend it. A touching story, superb writing and an ending that ties up all the loose ends beautifully. I thought it was clever how all the characters have some connection to the tightrope walker, even though they are not directly related.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not enough search items and I do not like having to look in dark.  It is okay but not what I like.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a big surprise to me and I loved it!!  If you like a book that does not go as you think it will, this is your choice.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a fun game! I like how creepy it is. It's lots of fun searching for things and really having to use your head.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bought the CD and low and behold - got to go to his concert!!! I think that my favorite songs on the cd are:  Natalie, Gorilla and When I was your man!!!!
0425263916|3.0|This was a Christmas gift. It wasn't for me. Apparently the person it was bought for liked the book. Thanks
B008J34466|5.0|Pink has the best sense of humor.  This is a fantastic cd - I took it to work and listen to it all the time.
0425263908|3.0|This book was bought as a Christmas gift. The person for whom it was bought for apparently liked it. Thanks
B009LXEBD4|4.0|I really liked this cd - looking forward to getting a lot more of her cds although I have downloaded a lot from iTunes.
034580404X|3.0|This was bought as a Christmas gift. The person who got it for Christmas really liked it. Thank you very much
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the graphics in this game are AMAZING!! the horses look so real! and you get so many great oppertuneties to do great.thing in this game
0757302661|2.0|This is not my first pregnancy so I was hoping this book will really give me some good techniques to have an easier birth.<br />But most of the book tells you more about positive thinking, and there is very little about the actual birth, and even less about the pushing part (I still have no idea what breathing down the baby really means)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this app.it is so much fun.i can not wait for the new levels to start.great game!!!?<br />nenah s.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Can't stop playing. Can't wait for more levels.  You get stuck in a few places, but it isn't to hard to where you can't figure it out.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Fun but a little complicated my nine year old grandson was better at it than I am.  Still trying to figure it all out.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Other Die Hard films much better, it is watchable, as I do like Bruce Willis movies.<br />Perhaps not another Die Hard.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read for anyone that likes a good romance with a surprise ending! Will definitely be reading more if his work.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|An older but good Bruce Willis film with Morgan Freeman. If you have not seen it I would recommend watching it.
0500516766|2.0|There are very few words or descriptions at all in here... The photos are well done and they are somewhat artistic but I thought this book would be more informative.  Definitely more on the art side than the usefulness side.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|What year was this in? A mini gun used by a witch? Automatic crossbow?<br />Given the time period as I saw it this was a little much.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|WHY DID IT TAKE THIS LONG! DAMN YOU GEOFF TATE!<br /><br />  I pre-ordered the album + T-shirt combo and received the album 7 days in advance!<br />Not disappointed in any way other than the album sounds too loud on certain tracks.<br />I haven't stopped listening to this album since I got it and I am totally looking forward to their next album thats being written now.<br /><br />Geoff Tate lost his voice long ago and it didn't have to be that way.<br /><br />Todd La Torre is truly an amazing vocalist, check out his work in Crimson Glory if you think otherwise.<br /><br />With that said I do miss Tate's style he has/had but he hasn't produced anything viable since his first solo album and that wasn't even very good. The last good song he was in was Damage from Promised Land.<br /><br />Anyways back to the album, MUSIC is solid, VOCALS are solid....Everything down to the packaging is SOLID! As broke as I am I might even spring for a second copy.<br /><br />This album deserves to be in the top ten on the billboard charts!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I liked the FX parts but the over all acting, predictability, and of course out come was pretty much seen<br />in the previews of this movie.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|His scientific training made his account of his NDE experience more believable.  The prose is simple and direct.  Highly recommended read for non-believers of NDEs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched the three seasons twice now and my pleasure just mounts with each viewing. Being able to stream it and watch it anywhere is truly amazing.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|First off, I just want to say that Henry Cavill's performance was unmatched by any other actor who's ever played Superman. George, Christopher, Dean, Brandon and Tom can all go suck it. I like Tom and Christopher in their own respective Superman universes, but neither of them, and ESPECIALLY not Routh, can compare to Cavill's performance. He brought a very human perspective to the character of Superman.<br /><br />The action in this movie is unparalleled, this is the one Superman movie we get to see where he gets to fully unleash his powers. You really feel like these are gods from Olympus who have come down to Earth to duke it out. I do think that a little less action could have been more, but as it is I love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best written dramas of all time concerning history.<br />Wow I just can';t stop watching it.  It is always taking twist and turn with the unexpected happening yet there were set up points for it in the past.  It is absolutely brilliant.  Bravo!
B009X2CUYA|5.0|Loved this book, and can't wait to read another Morton story.  Beautifully written.<br />I was there at the mansion, could picture every room....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's mighty awesome. I love the horse, love my RatCh. LOL I just did this for the gems like everyone else did.
B008133MDK|4.0|This show rocks, has a great cast and strong plot lines.  It's seemingly much more true, albeit in a modern context, to the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing than many of the other Sherlock iterations and similar to the recent movies with Robert Downey Jr.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Interesting story line, but a bit overdone in production. It got to the point where I quit watching. I didn't like it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is highly addictive and leaves  wanting more stars. I can never have enough stars! Just when I find myself getting into it,I run out of stars.
B009EAO38C|5.0|My dad always listened to classical music, and I could never enjoy it like he did.  This is a wonderful way to share modern music with a classical twist with your children.  My 6 year old loves this CD too.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Ever wanted to post especially cool-looking pictures, but didn't want to spend a thousand hours editing? I'd definitely recommend this app.<br />It is ....<br /><br />worth the 99 cents<br />Quick and easy to use<br />*has a feature to erase blemishes seamlessly!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a good way to tune out the noise of everyday life. My wife loves it because it keeps me out of her hair, lol! Great time burner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is totally fun. Nonstop play. They had such a unique idea!!!!! Please get it. You will not regret it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Magic 2014 is epic. It's so amazing to have a great version of Magic on Android let alone the latest version. Although you have to purchase the full game to unlock all the decks but I'm sure if you are a true MtG player you'll purchase it. The sealed campaign is sweet, finally we get to make our own decks without any restrictions. That alone is enough to make me purchase the full game. I'm too excited to put into words how awesome it is to have this, I don't mind the multiplayer feature not being included. I'm sure it'll be updated. I'm just happy to play MtG anywhere without the physical cards.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I loved the movie but it seemed like it didn't say wheather it was a world wide virus or just america or just that city. And I didn't say if love cured just cured the airport or the city or the world or america. But it was amazing!!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It was a joy to find out at the end that many of the retired musicians in the residence were actually retired musicians in real life - and I don't think my telling that will spoil it for anyone. It may even be better. It was a wonderful blend of story, characters and beautiful music. The music is still with me. Very rich.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|...to go off the rails here.  The story is getting less coherent and the characters less interesting. And this latest edition was fraught with typographical errors.  I'll still finish out the series, but I may start skipping chapters going forward.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Good movie, I have seen this one before also.  But forgot what it was about.  Keeps you hanging on to your seat.
0060899190|3.0|Book was in great shape, but was dissapointed the dust cover was missing and that wasn't included in the description.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I watch the whole season and had picked Phillip to win it all, which he did. Great first CD and enjoy listening.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Excellent actors performance , full of suspense based in real facts. Just before you rent it , make sure<br />the next season is available.  it's highly addicted !!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just love the tension between the different behind the sceans staff that work for Downton Abbey. I also love how it follows the history of the world during the show
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is tricky but not impossible. A great puzzle game. A few times I was stumped but after I played around for a while I got it. My new favorite game, can't wait for more levels!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I love Les Miserables, the story is fantastic, and I've adored every version of it I've come across, this book included, however, if you're short on time, I recommend you get the abridged version.  Hugo is a military brat and a romantic, and it definately shows in this book.  There is a lot of information, and it's formatted a bit oddly.  He gives full textbook spreads of military operations, Biographical backgrounds, and some of the scenes where Cossette and Marius are just sitting in the garden go on for a bit too long.<br /><br />In all, it's a great read, but if you don't have a month or two to devote to this book, try to find the abridged version.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|This movie is both captivating and chilling... Its the perfect teen thriller and will e enjoyed over and over again... and the soundtrack is spectacular. The song &#34;cry little sister&#34; is a masterpiece!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP, I CAN CHECK THE WEATHER JUST ABOUT EVERY WHERE.  MY HUSBAND IS A FARMER AND FINDS IT USEFUL.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this game I just really bate the dumb pop ups. one showed a game for girls and they were shoeing some inappropriate things
B001U8ZSCG|4.0|Very good compilation of music.  Good for people who enjoy classic rock and blues.  Lots of good crusing music (for your car).
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I admittedly had high expectations for this film, as I love all things with a Celtic flavor, and the story of a spirited little girl appealed to me.  It starts out nice, setting up the theme of changing one's fate and Merida's attempts to do so are fun to watch.<br /><br />But the story I think gets a bit off-center once the witch enters the picture.  It struck me as undermining the whole message that she needed magic to essentially change the rules and get herself out of her current situation, rather than finding a clever way to do so on her own.  Is she really changing her fate in that case, or is some mystical force doing so that we couldn't possibly call on in real life?  What sort of message does that send?<br /><br />I was also expecting the antagonist of the film to take more of a center-stage in things... possibly even being a love-interest, ala Beauty and the Beast.  That is one time where magic would have been acceptable - to counteract previous magic.  But this doesn't pan out, either.<br /><br />What we get here is a perhaps-touching film about family values when we really could of had a strong leading female changing her fate through the sheer force of her will.  While the film as it is is certainly enjoyable in its own right, the latter would have perhaps made a more powerful, poignant film.  I can still recommend it, but not as strongly as I might have.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Really,  are people honestly giving low scores because of the religious tone?  Not a single low rating for anything else.  This game has clean graphics, no permissions and hard game play. I do agree that you should be able to move forward regardless of stars.  What's next. We will complain about ANGRY BIRDS because they are killing pigs that only stole eggs?  My impredsionable kids may have a schoolmate steal their lunch, so they will pelt them with rocks using a slingshot until they are dead. Come on people.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I feel sure that this is one of those books that will stay w/ me for days now that i have finished.  I feel sure it is a pretty good reflection of the time period. There are many white characters that you admire and love, but many that you simple can't help but loathe. Others just frustrate you for being so unaware of how their inaction adversely affects so many.  You will have a hard time putting this book down!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love this game. I wish it was the second or first thing I downloaded. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B00942G4UA|5.0|This was extremely eye opening.  Its very sad the current climate of the food production systems of this country.  If you watch this it will change what you eat and how you look at things at the grocery store... and I would highly reccomend you watch it!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It total helped with my mario bros craving!a little bit addicted at the moment. Very fun came and free can't get better than that
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|I must say of all the Die Hard movies this was the darkest and it is shot that way everything gray and dark.  Also of the films this is not set in the USA.  And if every father and son have a bonding experience like this the world is in trouble.  There were some nice action scenes and I was a little surprised who the bad guy turned out to be.  I was disappointed.  If you are a Bruce Willis fan no matter what than I am sure you would still like this movie.  For me not really liking it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awesome all you have to do is swim around and eat the fish of your choice. As you eat more ed fish you level up and get an even bigger shark. It never lags and you can play in two different ways.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|If it wasn't for the same subject matter on a lot of the songs, this album would have easily been a 5 but either way I can't stop listening to it cole has gotten so much better at production. Still waiting on a classic like Friday night lights, but its still a cole world tho!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A truly magnificent book. !! Each part of the book comes  together seamlessly. I could not put it down.<br />Hosseini deserves the Nobel Prize  in Literature!!!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is really entertaining! It will keep kids and preteens (like me) reading for hours at a time! I finished all the other book  already and this one only took me a day! Jeff Kinney, what can I say , you are amazing!
B000JMKSE2|5.0|Excellent plan for positioning marketing, merchandising and communications strategies for maximum effectiveness. Graphic presentations are first-rate. The program is practical for a variety of applications.
B000SEI230|5.0|I liked the story and it was interesting . In fact I couldn't put it down , but I was disappointed  by the ending. I wanted to know how his life turned out and if he marries again.

1451695195|1.0|This was a gift for an incarcerated person who has no ability to order books - it's a shame - he's been waiting on reading material for over a month and I just tracked down shipment to find out Angola sent books back due to no receipt - this is terrible for him and poor business.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I like that the birds' eyes are big when they are hit.  The bubbles make it hard because you turn around.
0770437400|3.0|Don't buy the (Mass Market Movie Tie-In Edition)of this book.  I am 2/3 through the book and the pages are already coming out. The story in the book is great and worth the read, just buy a better quality book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love the second season with all the twist and turns these episodes take you through. I love it more than the first season.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Im rating this a 1 star only so all the other people rating one can see , to update the kindle edition they have to re-write the code for the update to work on the kindle .they cant just take the code from the apple version or the pc . And their main focus isnt just pocket edition , its pc .
0307596885|4.0|Munro is one of the three or four most talented and most reliably enjoyable writers of short fiction in English since World War II, and she has a whole shelf of awards and prizes to prove it. And this twelfth volume of stories demonstrates that the previous eleven weren't just flukes. Nearly all of her work is set in the small Canadian towns around the Great Lakes, an area with which she is intimately familiar, and they mostly feature ordinary people from all across the social spectrum just trying to get through life. This is chamber music, not symphonies or marching brass bands. And the reader can learn quite a lot just by watching and listening.<br /><br />Munro has quite a range of subjects and approaches, too. \\"To Reach Japan,\\" for instance, concerns a young poet-mother's flight across the continent by train, away from a reliable but unexciting engineer husband and in search of a reunion with the older journalist who once rescued her from a literary house party. There's not really a beginning and end here. It's more an extended snapshot from a not entirely successful search for happiness. \\"Amundsen,\\" on the other hand, is narrated by a young college graduate from Toronto come to teach at a childrens' TB sanitarium out in the cold woods during the last year of World War II. (Not that she tells you that right out. As in most of Munro's writing, the reader has to do a little work, too, picking up the clues.) It begins as she waits for a ride at the train station and ends as she takes the train back to the big city, and in between she has experienced six months of snow, adolescents with no hope, a local teenager with a boisterous personality, and possibly love with the sanitarium's surgeon. Or at least she hopes that's what it was. Munro is also always very good at descriptions: \\"The frozen lake not level but mounded along the shore, as if the waves had turned to ice in the act of falling.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gravel\\" concerns sibling relationships, both with each other and with their mother, and what can happen when not everyone can adapt to radical changes in the family. In \\"Haven,\\" an adolescent girl has to spend a year with her controlling uncle and always-yielding aunt while her own freethinking parents are off working in Africa. This gives her the opportunity to explore strange country herself, as she observes family dynamics of a sort she never could have imagined. There are some great lines here, too. After describing her aunt's tea cakes and shortbreads created for company, she comments that \\"I myself had never seen the like. My parents gave the kind of parties where people ate chili out of clay pots.\\" \\"Pride\\" is a very different sort of story, and a very good one, about a once-wealthy woman and a lone (but not necessarily lonely) man with a repaired harelip and their distant and then close relationship over the decades from the Depression to nearly the present day. And they travel from separate houses to two adjacent apartments, which is a nice touch. The narrator's voice this time is determinedly lower-middle-class -- and also male, which is unusual for Munro. \\"Corrie\\" is another unusual story, about a wealthy young woman who has a brief, unplanned affair with a married architect hired to replace the church steeple. Then they're found out by her maid, who blackmails them on the installment plan. And then it becomes a lingering affair stretching over the years, and finally the resilient Corrie arrives at a surprising resolution to their problem. Really, this one will catch you off-guard.<br /><br />One of the best in the collection, and the most complete as a \\"story,\\" is \\"Leaving Maverley,\\" which has a relatively large cast of characters: The night cop who marries a woman who may have left her husband for him, and then has to watch as her health declines; the teenager from an almost cloistered fundamentalist family who takes a job selling tickets at the town's movie theater, and who has to be careful not to watch the pictureor listen to the dialogue; and the town's new, young minister and the older, much more conservative man he's replacing. This one is sort of a series of related character portraits and all of them are very nicely done. There are half a dozen more stories here, some of them more closely autobiographical than the others, and all of them are worth reading, and lingering over, and thinking about. Beautiful stuff.or listen to the dialogue; and the town's new, young minister and the older, much more conservative man he's replacing.

B0062QRTKA|5.0|I've owned this from the Play Store for a long time and have to say this is one of the rare FAOTD gems. Definitely worth the regular price. It is challenging, has great gameplay mechanics for touch screens, and beautiful graphics.<br /><br />The backstory is a VERY fictional religious context. Adamant Atheists may find that offputting and religious conservatives may find it offensive. The rest of us will find interesting and humorous.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love this app.  Helps to pass time when waiting at doctor's office or a restaurant.  Much easier to take with my than my Kindle Fire tablet or my Kindle e-reader.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Innovative plots, excellent special effects, and good acting (for the most part). A fresh take on fantasy and science fiction.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I've been a Kelly fan since American Idol.  This CD shows how far she has come since then with the songs from her first CD to her current CD (&#34;Stronger&#34;).  Not sure why it was released so close to that CD though.  There are 3 new songs on it that were never released previously and they are really good. Perhaps they did not make the cut for the &#34;Stronger&#34; CD.<br />Would definitely recommend.
B00499NHLC|3.0|As usual, good British actors can take a mediocre script and time-worn plot and make it viewable. I am a life-long Sherlockian and when one takes Holmes and Watson out of Victorian England much of what makes the stories live and breathe is lost. As a famous Sherlockian once said, with Holmes and Watson &#34;It is always 1895.&#34;
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Perfect casting, and superb writing.  The dialogue has the 'ring of reality' (&#34;hey, the actors sound like real people talk!&#34;).  Truly well done.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|This was a good movie on whole, but surprisingly not that engaging. Perhaps a little too contrived, even though based on a true story. It did give some good visuals and a good idea of what it must have been like for many after that horrendous event.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the interaction between the nobility and the staff.  The story lines do not draw out and keeps things interesting  I wish this would come to my tv.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|One man's opinion - Let me start by saying I watch movies... a LOT of movies.  On a given week I can easily view 15-20 movies - being permanently disabled has given me a lot of time on my hands.  Secondly, I LOVE BAD MOVIES... not all bad movies, but generally speaking the cheesier the better.  I love it when a bad movie crosses that invisible line between simply terrible to a new paradigm - what I like to call \\"So bad, it's good\\".  Need an example, \\"Battle Beyond the Stars\\" or as I like to call it John Boy in Space!!!  It's terrible, it's wonderfully, joyfully, nay, tearfully terrible.  Watch virtually ANY Christopher Lee horror film from the 60s or 70s.  You probably get the picture so I'll move on.  I bought this supposedly \\"Tarantino\\" film expecting bad - I wasn't disappointed (in that).<br /><br />It really didn't take very long to realize the only thing Quentin Tarantino had to do with this film was to make money off his name.  The filming of this movie had nothing of his quirkiness or well thought out scenes, none of his witty script-craft, and none of his skill in bringing a film to the silver screen.  What does appear on screen is a movie, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly scripted, poorly organized, poorly scored.  The \\"short of it\\" in Texas parlance can be summed up thus - a hot mess, bless their hearts.<br /><br />How could this huge mistake have happened you might ask yourself (I sure did).  When a film goes this far off the ranch you have to start with the basics - who wrote the film - they are ultimately responsible for what's presented.  The film was written by Robert Diggs (East Coast Rapper and Wu-Tang Clan leader) and Eli Roth (of 'Hostel' and 'Hostel:Part 2' fame (ya, I missed those two too)).  The film was directed by Diggs... and stars Diggs as well (or as he self-styled RZA - a moniker which in this movie's case should stand for Razzle (Dazzle) since the film has so little substance and so much flash).  Mr. Razzle Dazzle also was responsible for the soundtrack (I know, big surprise there too).  RZA was clearly over his head in every way imaginable, the writing is sluggish and uninspired, the directing is amateurish, the soundtrack commits the ultimate sin - its so poorly married to what's happening on screen it pulls you out of the movie, and the acting was flat.  I can almost forgive RZA for his performance and ever-present hip-hop / hood-inspired language (what direction is 'Norf' anyway?  That's right, I'm 'axing' you), but the deplorable job done by both once A-List stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu leaves much to the imagination (and what you fill in for their apparent lack of enthusiasm wasn't good).  Crowe would seem to be going the way of Marlon Brando (all the girth and half the talent) and Liu's performance is a text book example of how she has gone from Lucy Liu to Lucy Who?  If I could give the film no stars I would.  It's not worth the cardboard it came wrapped in.  I hope Tarantino enjoyed the cash given to borrow his name and I sincerely hope he actually reads the next script before cashing the check - in this business we call show, reputation is everything and this was most certainly NOT a Tarantino film.  One or two of these and his fan base will take a walk (I hope your listening Mr. Tarantino, I'm still a fan... for now).  In summary - Hot Mess, RZA=Razzle Dazzle, Lucy Who? and DON'T BUY THIS FILM, DON'T EVEN RENT IT - just walk away... run if you're able.<br /><br />Bad movie, BAD movie - BAD MOVIE.  PS - Hollywood - DON'T GIVE RZA MONEY (unless you are looking for a tax write off, then it makes sense.)or the soundtrack (I know, big surprise there too).

042524489X|5.0|Sienna Lauren is an X. Hawke is the Alpha of the SnowDancer pack. Several years ago when the Lauren family defected from the Net, they found safety and anonymity in the SnowDancer pack. Now, hostilities between the changelings and the Psy are coming to a head and Sienna and Hawke must navigate the muddy waters between their races and themselves. Can they do it or will everything they hold dear turn to ash?<br /><br />I LOVED this installment of Nalini Singh's Psy / changeling series. This particular story had been brewing ever since book one - and it was worth the wait. The only pitfall is that while this is a definite read, it is not necessarily a stand-alone read. There are a lot of details that are mentioned that might get missed if a reader has not read any of the previous books in the series.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|This worked really well for getting the Kinect to consistently see my little ones who are just 3 + feet tall.
B003L77GRO|1.0|None of the four discs worked. There was a gluey film around each disc as well. I also somehow got two of the cases that said disc 1-2. It didn't have a disc 3-4 case. I contacted the seller about returning but can't find where to send a return request so haven't been able too. I informed them of this and still didn't get the help. I just want a working product and to not be out $30.

B0064J6PMI|5.0|This is a comedy masterpiece. Right up there with Wedding Crashers. Would highly recommend watching when you are in the mood to laugh.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved every minute I spent reading this book.  I was starting to think that reading a book on the kindle was destroying my reading pleasure, then I bought this book and devoured it in a day or so.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Its hard to believe it, but the series just keeps on getting better.  Now that Castle and Beckett are together, you might think the series would take a turn towards boring, awkward, predictable, but that is not the case.  I think the writers continue to deliver new and creative work.

B002EMESSM|3.0|It was fine.  I am not a trekkie, but am a nerd at heart.  I hadn't seen this FOREVER and seeing it now...wow.  There are some of the slowest scenes in any movie I have ever seen.  &#34;Can we pan around the enterprise one more time?!?!&#34;

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am hooked on Angry Birds. Great animation and sound. I wish I had a bigger screen to play it on. I recommend everyone over 6 years old to give it a try.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While Mr Housseni is a good story teller and author, this book has too many characters and subplots to keep track of.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best of the flies levi Johnston the same time yet the games i have to go to bed typical for the games are you going camping trip to you can do it it doesn't mAtter if I will give you read the flies levi and I was a weird that I have been on my kindle says that mean that it is the same.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The plot in this story is just part of what you can receive from this book. There is a lot of character development and conflict that gets your pulse going. This is the type of book that needs to be read many times to piece together what is happening. The experience I get from this book is just stunning.
0142405809|5.0|We love this book. My 5-year-old granddaughter visited us for a couple of weeks, and we read it over and over. She loved it so much, I had a copy shipped to her home so she can read it there. It's a great story, beautiful pictures. My new favorite children's book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The plot of this book is fairly easy to follow. The story unravels quite nicely so that you do not feel like it is being stretched. It is nice to see that there is an ending for The Hunger Games.
B00C061I3K|5.0|you should just buy it already, its like their first album in almost ten years, not counting the other two.
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl took some tough criticism when this book was released, however when great change is required people always resist, that's why I knew I had to read this book for myself. She is a pioneer in this new feminist movement. And I for one appreciate her insights, as one of the few Women who has access to the Boardroom her suggests have relevance. I would recommend this book to young girls especially.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie was awesome! I had expected it to tell the story of &#34;OZ&#34;, the Wizard, before Dorothy arrives and that is exactly what it does. It explains his background and past and then sends us through a thrilling adventure. It also shows us how the &#34;wicked witch&#34; turns green. LOL :) Great movie... Always loved the Wizard of Oz and Loved this one as well.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am now reading the book and read about 25%. I am enjoying it, but have to think about who the characters are when talked about. I would recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I could only get Season 1 on my Netflix, so very happy to be able to get Season 2 on Amazon Prime.  I enjoy the show a lot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game! Keeps thinking of where things could be hiding. It's not easy but not too hard. I would recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|In the beginning this movie was uncomfortable because of its subject matter.  However, after letting go of the discomfort, it became a beautifully moving story.  Also it was very well acted.
B009X011UQ|5.0|This is the second time I bought a Marware case; I bought one for my original Kindle Fire. I love how it fits my Kindle and that it is slim and compact.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love the character of John Puller. Nice twist at the end, and more than a few twist in the middle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can honestly tell you that this game is addictive and fun! I personally love a good challenge and you should play this too. I highly recommend this to you and so I say to you have fun FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great movie, fun packed adventure, some humor, fun for all the family this is a must see and all the others.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is hard in some places but easy in others. Don't listen to those others reviews endless if they are like mine. You should only get this app if you are up to the challenge.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have a note 2, which I love, and while it is a smaller size, I can live with that for this app. I've used up my battery twice so far. It's the only time I wished my phone was bigger.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Megadeth is one of the masters. I have seen a few critical reviews for this cd but no matter how good the cd is there will always be somebody that don't like it. Granted this may not be the best Megadeth cd but by no means the worst. I think they were more exploratory in this and not very political as they tend to be with most of their releases. Megadeth is like Slayer to be one the best you take the most hits when the diehards think you have strayed off a small path they have set for you. This is not the best cd by them but its not the worst. A good buy for any fan.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|The singing and dancing are fantastic! My daughter got my started watching and I couldn't stop. Couldn't wait to start watching season 2.
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|Testament continues putting nothing but solids releases. This one is no different. The cd is long but you will find they haven't lost anything. They are a classic and this release proves why they hold that status
B004XISI4A|1.0|&#34;This was a bitch&#34; the author let us know at the end of  part 5 of A song of Ice and Fire. And indeed it was a bitch, not only to write but to read as well.. The book tells 5,6,7 stories at the same time, only losely connected and all extremely slow moving. It is not uncommon for multi-part Fantasy epics to lose momentum, but this one comes to a nearly complete standstill. Lengthy descptions of landscapes, meals and the dilemma's facing the protagonist fill page after page. At the end  all parts have moved a couple af inches but remain completely open ended. Highly irritating. The problem is that having invested in this lengthy interlude you want to know how it ends but it does not look as if there is any end in sight. Very disappointing.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Before buying this CD I'd never really listened to any Elvis music except what I heard by chance on the radio or at wedding dances and so on. I actually bought it for my brother as sort of a gag gift, and then after making the purchase, I noticed the AutoRip feature. What a welcomed bonus! I downloaded the CD, put the songs on my iPod, and started listening. After a good month, I'm still not tired of it. I think it's one of those CDs that will never lose its luster no matter how many times I listen, like Tom Petty's Greatest Hits. I recommend this CD to anybody who has the slightest interest in Elvis music but doesn't know where to begin.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Amazing recording. I didn't expect this gem from the Purps. Big surprise, I'd say one of the five best Purple albums. Sure enough not a milestone like In Rock, Machine Head, Burn or Made In Japan, but a very honest record.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|In this book, for third time,the author used the same formula.<br />Not so good. Just Ok. If you don't buy it you don't miss a thing.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|They didn't really explain everything well at the end.  Kinda left you hanging with unanswered questions.  Other than that  it was good.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|As far as movie adapted musicals, they don't all succeed.  This one is done marvelously.  Made me want to watch it more than once.  The characters were portrayed well.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie. Drama, Romance, War... this is such a classic. Loved it!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris is awesome as always.  I so love the books more than the tv series.  The humor and detail of course is so much better when you read!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I absolutely love ...Like Clockwork! It is everything I hoped the new Queens of the Stone Age would be. Cant wait to hear it live~
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game My Horse. It's a great game for your kids. And it's FREE.And who dosn't like free?
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is so cool! I love playing my princess game.<br />Princesses games are perfect for me!!!! I love princesses I books!!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Common... its Monsters, Inc! Of course I love this movie. Monsters University was also amazing. We watched this again after seeing its prequel.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Hansel & Gretel is new spin on the story I read growing up. I love it, I will not share it with my grandchildren.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|They still sound Great after 50 years! It was great seeing them all together, it was the first time I saw David Marks.
B00C8RDSWK|5.0|Bought this for the kids and they love it (7 and 10 years old). I've sat through parts of it with them and I have to admit, it had me going pretty good too. It's one of those movies that is for kids, but the writers throw stuff in there that the parents can relate to but the kids probably don't even notice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nice work.  The story accelerates nicely to a satisfying conclusion. The high points are high and the low points are some of the lowest.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Expected so much more. Kinda gets boring a quarter the way threw. Get very repetitive. All the jokes seem the same. Love Ellen but the book not so much :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and exciting game. Lots of challenging levels to play.great game for people who love puzzling games.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The second and third books in the Ender Quintet have been disappointing.  The first book was great.  At first I was excited to read the rest of the series.  However, it feels like these books are just playing on my desire to know the rest of Ender's story, and not that they are actually capturing my full interest.  This book was still good enough that I didn't dislike it... But it wasn't anything phenomenal either, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it.  This book starts the slow death of the series in my opinion.  The books went from Great to half decent to moderately better than staring at a wall for several hours... and I have no desire to read the fourth.  If it follows this trend I may indeed end up staring at a wall instead.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very intense! I watched the entire season in the span of 2 days because I got so hooked on it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm not going to go into the story, but if you are on this page considering it at all... then you are definitely someone who should read it.  You won't be disappointed.  However, I do recommend that you read this book, and just ignore the rest of the series... the rest was a huge letdown after this one.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I recommend this book to anybody thinking about making a change in their life. Most of the book was not new information but forced me to think about it in a different way.
1455523003|5.0|....Hitchens raises great questions and gives greater answers as to why the cult of Theresa personality is largely bankrupt...interestingly enough partly because she's rollin' in so much dough.
B003X27L9U|5.0|Absolutely fantastic...couldn't put it down. Very sensitive. Wonder what people who have actually been through the harrowing experience would think.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|IT WAS GOOD AND I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT HAD FUNNY THINGS IN IT. MR.BOOKWRITER IS A GOOD JOKE TELLER.
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|This story is extremely well written. His language is refreshingly unique, intriguing and original. I've never read anything with quite the same amount of quirkiness as this short novella. The character Holiday Golightly is this strange mix of sad, optimistic, tragic and sound. She enchants everyone she comes into contact with, and she will forever be a character that you will go back to. This story isn't exactly the love story the movie makes it out to be, but on the other hand, it is! The narrarator observes Holly as she goes through her life and admits that she has a certain charm and that he may be a little in love with her, but he isn't sure if love is what he is feeling. Holly Golightly is written and described as something like vapor. You can see her, hear her, feel her presence in the room but you cannot hold her. She is unobtainable and that is why she has lived for so long as this tantalizing creature. In the movie she is tamed, but here in her original story she is as wild as ever and never conquored by love or belongings and possesions, even though she harbours a secret desire to be.<br /><br />This book is well worth the read. 4/5 stars.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is fun, makes you want to come back for more.  I hit a block on level 4 stopped for less than 24hours. I have become addicted to this game
B003UM6MPC|5.0|Not only does this come with the complete soundtrack from &#34;Once More With Feeling&#34;, but it also includes the suites from &#34;Hush&#34; and &#34;Restless&#34;. The sound is great, it's so nice to hear the music without watching the episode over and over again. Definitely worth the money.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|I'm past halfway and love this book. The author has a beautiful voice and a real master of her craft.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Anything but predictable. Full of unexpected twists & turns right up to the last page. I loved it and I am PICKY. Absolutely thrilling!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Sell the rights back to Joss or Netflix and let them run with it you sorry excuse of a Goram Network!
B008QI6EHQ|1.0|The book gives details about early Germany that are interesting and also gives a look inside the twisted mind of a proud and arrogant misfit like some we now know on the world stage. Anyone who writes a book on their own morbid ideas, their own devious life and who have blood on their hands will fit the description of this man and there is no shortage of them even now throughout the world and in our own back yard. They are very cunning and deceitful and can take over a country that is vulnerable and weak so everyone should keep a sharp eye on everything that happens in their own government and do something about bad people at the top. This is a boring example of the miserable life of a spiritually dead and sick person and a perfect example of someone who should be banned from any government service and who should probably be locked up for life because they are dangerous. It has been said that the most dangerous animals on this planet are humans and they are  destructive, even to themselves.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I liked the way there was a full sound in these phones.  The fit on my head seems a little off...but I'm used to it now.  The price on these was incredibly low and so I didn't expect much. but these are better than the expensive phones There were some bad reviews but I didn't run into any problems with mine.  Worth a try if you asked me.  I'm happy with my purchase.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Sort of boring so far. It is not near as engaging as &#34;Lone Survivor&#34;. I will probably finish it, though.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|It's difficult to be original with such well tread material, yet they succeed in it. I really enjoyed this version. (Baskerville was a little weak, to be honest.)
B00BBW14YC|5.0|Excellent!  Such a super film. 2 men from totally different walks of life, together make this film something worth watching. A great true and heartwarming story of friendship.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great app just what I need the only thing it needs a better look. Cause it still has a old look at least to me. I would like to see the with a more hd look. For hd samsung galaxy s4 phone..loo
B00992CF6W|5.0|if u enjoy building and challenges u will love survival on minecraft if u hate challenges but love building u can play creative! this game is amazing I love it I play it all the time! I love getting &quot; gifts&quot; from zombies, creepers, spiders, and skeletons. I totes recomend this game
B00881VLCE|2.0|I thought it was annoying that at first I couldn't get the pcs to rotate, then realized you have to turn that feature on every game. Really? Like there'd be a game where that wasn't required? Then, once you have more than one pc together, you can't rotate but sometimes you don't know until you put a pc or two together. Stopped playing at all.
B005T87QCI|3.0|My son loves this game. The graphics are really good too. I wish you didn't have to pay to unlock every little thing though.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|I take after my brother with appreciation for classic horror. I grew up not afraid of monsters. I always said I could never meet Frankensteins monster in a grocery store check out line...but I could very well meet a homocidal maniac. The classic monsters are the best.<br />There is just so much blood and gore you can create in films. Actually the bloody gory so called horror movies of today are so much like the six o'clock news reports that there is nothing shocking about them...nothing surprising. They come and go quickly but the classics endure.<br /><br />Take the classic horror movies and you have creativitiy and the subtle spine tingling fear of the unknown. Nothing beats them.<br /><br />These commemorative DVDs preserve the legacy and provide extra items of interest. I highly recommend collecting the series from this classic day in film history.<br /><br />Dont stop at Frankenstein....get all the classics before they are gone. Universal Monters and Englands Hammer Film Monsters.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|My wife had a copy at one time and it disappeared. She mentioned it to me and so I ordered one for her. Got it in two days and she is very happy.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|I watch this movie every 6 months, delighting in Orlando and Liam's acting.  The battle over Jerusalem is nearly historically accurate.  Wunderbar.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|cant believe we waited so long to get the dvd! College age kids watch it all the time, funny how they remember their childhood through movies
B00005JLO2|5.0|Excellent re-make of an old classic.  Outstanding &#34;square formation&#34; battle scene.  Heath Ledger was magnificent in his emotional displays.  Heath, we miss you!  Where are you now?
B006OAB2WK|5.0|Hard to put my finger on exactly why I like this so much...but I do. Solid album from start to finish.
0062073567|5.0|This book is remarkable and extremely important on several levels as to the overall works of Agatha Christie.  First, it is classical Christie - many would say and do say that it is her best work.  Second, this was Christie's 7th detection novel and it was the book that \\"made her.\\"  This work was the turning point in this author's writing career.  After its publication she quickly became the all times best selling detective author in history....still is even after all these years.  Third, this work, right from the beginning, has been surrounded in controversy and still is to this day due to the unorthodox plot device the author chose to use.  Christie changed the way detection novels were written and a large group of authors down through the years owe her much.  Forth, as you read this work pay close attention to Dr. Sheppard's sister.  Here Christies has given us the prototype of the famous armature detective, Miss Marple...what a delight.  The sister was one of my favorite characters in this book.<br /><br />Of course this work features the delightful little detective and his legendary gray cells in all of his quirkiness.  Other than possibly Sherlock Holmes, Poirot is the best known fictional detective in the world of literature.  This work also features a large cast of characters and each and every one of them is a suspect...very valid suspects I might add.  In this one work we have suicide, blackmail, theft and of course murder.  We have fidelity and infidelity, love, suspicion, and an extremely complex set of clues that the reader must sort though very, very carefully!<br /><br />I will say right now that part of the enjoyment of this work was taken away from me because I knew who did it before I began the reading.  This is due to the fact that the controversy mentioned above has been discussed, hashed and rehashed hundreds of times throughout the years and if you have read any of the background literature available on the works of Agatha Christie you too will know the final ending...this was a bit of a bummer but surprisingly It did not distract all that much in my enjoyment of the reading.<br /><br />Like many of the crime novels by this author, this was a locked room mystery and like many it is populated by a number of family members and servants; all of whom have much to gain by the death of the poor guy who was done in.  Clues, clues and more clues to sift though...this is a busy read and the reader must pay close attention!  Had I not already know who did it, I must admit that I was not bright enough to figure this one out until the last two chapters when all was revealed.<br /><br />This was a library book.  Our library is currently stocking its shelves with these Black Dog and Leventhal publications.  They are nice books and if I were to start collecting hardback edition, they would be my choice at this time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksknow the final ending...this was a bit of a bummer but surprisingly It did not distract all that much in my enjoyment of the reading.<br /><br />Like many of the crime novels by this author, this was a locked room mystery and like many it is populated by a number of family members and servants; all of whom have much to gain by the death of the poor guy who was done in.

B003JH8LPW|3.0|As compared to Mr Brown's more recent books Digital Fortress is just okay.  But it was still a decent read.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|If it hadn't been for Anthony Hopkins and Helen Miren I would have only given this movie3 or 4 stars (it would have still been pretty good), but with those two incredible actors, it was a 5-star for sure! Hopkins nailed Hitchcock...it was hard to believe it was Hopkins just playing him sometimes! And Helen Miren did such a wonderful job of being the &#34;supporting role&#34; while at the same time having her own spotlight - I never knew anything before about Mrs. Hitchcock (or even that there was one!), but she had me loving her as much as her husband and appreciating the role Mrs. Hitchcock played in the success of her husband. The movie was light with a touch of spice and humor...I loved it!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a bit dispappointed.  The plot was not well developed towards the end of the book.  It seemed like the author was rushing to close things out.  Then, after i finished the book, i found out that there's anoter book that lets you know how things work out for each of the main characters.  Why wasn't this included in Dead Ever After?......
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Very nice product. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to keep track of items using electronic media and devices.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like this game if u like rpg games then this is the game for you trust me you will fall in love with this game I only played it for an hour and I was amazed this is a game for people who like f adventurous games this game is way better than dungeon hunter 3 because this is a roleplaying game and dungeon 3 is Just DO the missions no roleplay involved if you liked dungeon hunter 3 then get this game it is way better than dungeon hunter 3  I want hem to make a dungeon hunter 5 if they do here are somethings to put in it put an alliance of archers warlords and a mage but make them all evil in there own dimensions where you would have to fight guards that protect them and fight all of them in a demon form that would please me by a lot if they make this I would love gameloft anyways get this game it will please you :) bye
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Even lame for the kids. We wend into this knowing it would be at best an average movie but it sucked pretty bad.
B007G92QGO|4.0|Brilliant character development, suspenseful and thoughtful. What a great read, but also makes you think about you and your own family - what are we capable of?
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Good game. You could spend a lot of money on this game, so be careful. More for older kids though.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This game has vibrate permissions... and that's it. Very enjoyable with cute sound effects. For the Christians who are irritated with it... Why? It's less blasphemous than Assassin's Creed. :P
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great. this set of games keeps u wanton to play more and not put it down. keeps ur interest up n on the go.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|I did not know that this was the inspiration for Bladerunner. It's a great scifi read and has a few minor twists that through you for a bit.
B00005MP58|5.0|Still the most true to the book and superbly cast and acted.  The interplay between the two leads is fantastic.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|The buttons on the right side are blank and no instructions as to how to play the game. Thank you
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a great little app. It's so nice not to have to remember the camera. My Ipad goes with me a lot so it's great to have it function as a camera, too.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love the story line. The costumes, setting, and story are fascinating to me.  I love the era my grandparents grew up in. Give me and understanding of how they were brought up. Helps me to understand why they were concerned about class, manners, station in life etc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I didn't expect much from a free escape game, but this.one is really good. I hope there are more levels coming soon.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is really cool and great and i love the combat in the game i have not tryed the multiplayer yet.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Helped me to get my documents in order on my tablet. It was a nice addition to the tablet. Thanks Amazon.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|bought this because never got a chance to watch past the first movie<br />I remember Keanu played in a movie something similar in the 80's or 90's called Johnny Mnemonic<br />Maybe we all live in the matrix ?<br />Awesome movie if you like sci fi  computer based  new world generation
0451232852|5.0|I'm still reading it. So far, it's fascinating. I really like how he tells his story by reporting on the lives of 'real people' back then, starting with the coal miners in Wales.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game and some really hard challenges and cant wait for more levels i hope u like the game to its so awesome
1439102813|5.0|This book is profoundly moving. Alzheimers is such a devastating disease. I appreciate how her care toward the end was quite different than one would expect. My family has also experienced this. I tried to email Lisa Genova, but never managed to do it.
B0026Q8EWW|3.0|This is a message as timely today as when it was put together.  Maybe even more timely today since nothing has happened to rein in insurance fraud in the meantime and the stakes have increased during that time.  An updated version would probably be a good thing and make a serious social statement again like this does.  Acting was good...Matt Damon's character was believable and the &#34;villians&#34; well cast with talent.
0425264351|1.0|As has been described already, this book is pretty damn bad.  The story is weak, the character development is pathetic and the writing is plain bush league.  If you want to read a action series the way one should be written check out the Joe Ledger series by Jonathan Maberry.  Accurate action/fighting/military technology and much better character development.  Reacher is worse than trash, save your $$$.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Sounds great, crisp and clear.<br /><br />People are complaining about the packaging?  You want fancy packaging, you'll have to pay more.  I bought this for the music, and the music only.  Shoot, the CD's were burned to my mac, and uploaded to my itunes library.  I never bought an album/tape/or cd in my life for the packaging.  I listen to these albums on my ipod.<br /><br />Bout time ZZ Top/Record label fixed their crappy remix.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|this movie was boring. it could have been sooooo much more, if they would've actually told a story and had believable characters. movies like these are frustrating, where the potential is there, but that's about it. not a good kids movie either - too much violence
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was forced to read for my book club but I couldn't put it down....heart wrenching, sad, horrifying, thought provoking, beautifully written and what was an obligation became a book I read for the joy of reading a well-written story.  I couldn't  put it down.

B0046B1KHG|4.0|Super funny and light hearted. This is one of my wife's favorite movies. Best quote = \\"It's so fluffy I could die!\\"
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app had no trouble recognizing current music, even some fairly obscure groups or songs. It did not recognize some early recorded music form the 1920's and '30's. Very useful, instant gratification.
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|This album is horrible!! 4-5 stars really scott friends!! the sound quality of this album is very bad!!  should have used Rick Rubin!!
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|We bought this game for our three year old daughter and it instantly became her favorite out of the series.  (She has every game and loves them all)  So far Handyman and Dr. Panda's Hospital are her favorites.  There's much to do in this game and if her imagination makes her poke a window, open it, make it rain, fix things around the house or paint something her favorite color, then she gets to do it!  She loves this game and it has made a great improvement in her attitude around the house.  We work with her every day in making good choices and the Dr. Panda series doesn't disappoint, as she wants to go around the house fixing things or making sure we know when something breaks.  Thank you TribePlay for this wonderful series, our family hopes you keep making them, our entire family gets the benefit of identifying with our little girl in new ways with each new release.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|All of the laughs were in the previews.  Not as good as I had hoped it would be. Barbara Streisand was fantastic, the story just wasn't that good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful look into history. Enjoy both the upstairs and downstairs views of English culture in the early 1900's. Can't wait to watch season three.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great movie!  I can see an entire Bourne series with Aaron!  I truly hope they make one more Bourne movie with Matt Damone.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|Excellent product. Gives a strong light. Holds a lot of time, two AA batteries, it is much more convenient than three AAA batteries (usually headlights) built good materials,<br />Expensive, the product had to include the Carry Case
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Not John Mclean's best work.  Very disappointed - I think its safe to retire John and the entire Die Hard series.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love it really amazing music. If you like this listen to radioactive with her and pentatonix. four more words done
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it! The Breakfast Club for a new generation.  The first-person point of view was an excellent voice, puts you right in the mind of a struggling high schooler - great!
B0062QRTKA|1.0|I am a Christian who has a sense of humorous and like the idea of this game.  just did not find it fun or entertaining.  clunky with irritating music.  not worth your time.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|it is really realistic, and it feels like you are<br /><br />here. great weapons and very neat misions, and pretty historically accurate
B00355L2TU|4.0|Seriously, this work out was great. Nothing super complicated or inherently difficult. Very well balanced. I felt like all my muscles got an equal work out but I could still move the next day. I would recommend stretching more than the video says as I've had lots of issues with my muscles knotting up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked playing this. Good game for novice gamer. Each floor more challenging than the last.  Looking forward to getting more floors!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Recently purchased a printer with wifi. This works great with it. Simple set up and easy to use. I recommend it.
0762777931|3.0|Ms. Carr losses some creditability with me by her use if profanity in the book which makes it difficult to recommend to some of my friends. Encouraging spirituality while using the f-word is a conflict for me.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|This game is okay. It has the same gameplay and rules of the real card game.<br />ALTHOUH, this is NOT the full game. It is only a trial. You must pay $10 for the full version. WTF!?
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds was a wonderful book. It is a long book.  I wish they would do an updated movie of this book. I had seen the movie on television several years ago.  They did it in a continual series of 2 or 3 shows, because the story covers a long period of time.  I think you lose something in movies when you make continual episodes.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|It's been a long time in the works but Queensryche has possibly achieved the most refined comeback in the history of heavy metal and hard rock. Since Chris Degarmo's departure, the band has endured great turmoil, suffering several lacking guitar substitutes and questionable outside writers, and in more recent years, lost all sense of its identity and became a ridiculed parody. Thankfully, this album is a rebirth and reclaim of what solidified Queensryche as a powerful rock entity; it's a total re-alignment of a sinking ship now charting a course for creative success and back to what Queensryche is and always was.<br /><br />Opening with the powerful instrumental 'X2' the album delves into the Parker Lundgren penned epic, 'Where Dreams Go To Die' a signature guitar, melodic bellow that evokes Wilton's unique strength on the 6-string. A rumbling chorus elevates the track further and signifies the promising content that later appears. 'Spore' bathes in an angered riff curdling underneath a solid rhythm drive. 'In This Light' recalls a more hardened evocation of 'Another Rainy Night' with a heartfelt resonance beckoning from the astounding vocal prime of Todd La Torre. 'Redemption' was the first full-length track released prior to the album and benefits from a harsher, heavy metal vibe that thunders from Scott Rockenfield's expert tight drumming. 'Vindication' is all out insanity and again, Rockenfield is unleashing a beast that has been restricted for years prior.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unexpected track is 'Midnight Lullaby' a surreal horror interlude leading into the haunting, psychological trip \\"A World Without\\" that acts as a ghostly collision of 'Roads to Madness' and 'Real World'. The orchestral arrangements exude the signature subtle Michael Kamen input under Scott's guidance. Todd's voice bathes in the macabre experience and Pamela Moore's backing vocals are beautiful and ghostly. Next up is 'Don't Look Back' which offers a more upbeat, fast-driven experience for the listener to overcome the shivering content of the previous track. 'Fallout' has a wicked heavy 1980's vibe punctuated by Todd's addictive vocal melody. The album closes with 'Open Road' an emotional exclamation mark to an exhilarating, interesting and emotionally varied experience.<br /><br />Queensryche is reborn and truly has returned. The sound on this record has been missing since 1994 and really feels like creative artists ushering pent-up catharsis into a platform that hasn't been available to them for many years until now. This is how Queensryche is supposed to sound, and after suffering deplorable antics of corrupted inner-workings and terrible records (records shouldn't even be branded Queensryche) the band has made a full recovery from what could have been a terminal illness and subsequent death.<br /><br />The only criticism I can state, which many reviewers and feedback noted, is the length of the album. Fortunately, it leaves you excited for more content from the guys. And the best part of this record - no filler.<br /><br />La Torre/Wilton/Jackson/Lundgren/Rockenfield - thanks for this album.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very good read. I enjoyed everyminute of it. I look forward to more books by this author.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It's just boring. It doesn't do anything exciting even my two year old will not play it. That's all I can say really.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars except for after you deal a game, an advertisement comes up that you have to close.  I guess that's the price you pay for a free game.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies during  my childhood years... being able to watch it again had filled my with great memories!! this is a must watch movie for everyone
B0001WTVUW|4.0|The DVD was in perfect condition, no scratches or anything. Played perfectly.<br /><br />The movie itself, really brings to light, to a young person &#60;30 years old, what could have happened during the Cold War. It could potentially happen even now.<br /><br />This is a great movie for anyone, maybe not the younger kids though &#60;13.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I echo all the bad reviews when I say no character development, no sustained narrative, implausible voices, a jarring dearth of female characters. ugh.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Dr Panda's apps are all amazing. My kids have a great time playing them because there is so much to do! I like them too!
B0076DELIG|5.0|The world of Harry Bosch is as immersive as ever. Mr Connelly makes you feel as if you are right there at the detective`s side during the whole book. The adventure of crime solver Detective Bosch and the human side of this character always satisfies the reader and leaves you wondering how long until the next Harry Bosch book comes out. Great read!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Rachel Joyce is gifted.. Her prose is beautiful and compelling, and I loved the story. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good book  that will stay with them for a long time.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Awesome show, no wonder this show has gotten so many Emmy awards.  Very well deserved! Writing and directing along with the actors are really great!  Just wish I would have watched this show before this past season.  It is really, really great!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every career woman should read this book , especially those in fields like tech and biotech. We all need to learn to be better at leaning in to help others.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was so close to not walking.  All my joints were giving me so much pain.  It took about 3 weeks of withdrawal.  Then 1 day I woke up.  I had slept through the entire night.  My joints didn't ache and I had more energy than I had in several years!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I purchased this because I work at a school near the racetrack. Many of the children have parents that work at the track but were unaware of this story. I owed the children a reward and they requested a movie and popcorn. This was my way of letting them relax but also giving them a story with local and historical significance. This was a terrific tale that held the attention of a room of video game loving ten year olds...not an easy task. Completely appropriate for all ages...no cursing or inappropriate situations. The movie sparked a conversation and even led to research on the internet.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of my favorites. This is one of about three series on CBS I follow. Streaming was great and episodes up to date except for current year of course. Good acting and casting. Storyline and writing better than most and a break from crime drama violence.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids love this and they get excited to build new cars, planes, whatever each level.  It is truly entertaining.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|This app is a load of crap,keeps freezing and stalling,a complete waste of time don't even try it save yourself the hassle
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun and never ending.  I like the different terrains and different vehicle options it provides to the user. Fun game.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|These movies must be shared with future generations.  I only wish the original theatrical versions would be released on Blu-ray.
1781162646|4.0|I love Stephen King books and this is one reason why. You never know what to expect. He again shows his talent.
B007N31Z06|5.0|I'm very happy about this being Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy. A perfect blend of this, my all-time favorite movie.
0345803485|4.0|I purchased the kindle version( I would suggest to do so), (might I add this is my first book read using kindle app also). I have what I would like to think is a above average vocabulary, and there was a few times there were words mentioned in the book that I would need a thesaurus/dictionary to understand the meaning, but using the kindle app it made it VERY easy to just tap the word unknown and get an instant definition/pronunciation right there on the page, quickly to go right back to the story where left out, didn't open any other browsers.<br />  The story started off rather slow, but picked right up after chapter 1 and so the sucking me in began. I had never read a romantic/erotic novel before but decided that their must be something spectacular considering how many days as # 1, and all the fans. I could see the story playing out in my mind as read. This is in no way a read for a child or teenager as a matter of fact. It took me a little while of debating in my head if I should continue reading or not once the love scenes started, but once my inner self quit fighting with morals, I got over my judgments and kept on swimming. I am so happy that I did. It took me about 5 days to read. There are 26 chapters. I was pleased that there was no usage of the \\"p\\" or \\"c\\" words in this read, as those are just turn offs for me. It is very worth the read, amazing story that just captivated me once I got over the guilt of reading an erotic novel. I liked that their were chapters without sexuality. I liked how they kept it as classy as possible for a story of this sort (BDSM) I did not like how it ended abruptly, making you want to start the 2nd in the series immediately to see how it played out, but in hindsight this was brilliant on the authors behalf, how could you not go buy the second after reading an ending like that? Although I would have been upset if I would have read this before the second book came out :) all in all, it is worth the read, I was very pleased :)
B00CW665VI|5.0|It was so worth the read.  Funny like laugh out loud funny and steamy. Hit the jack pot with this one. Well worth the money
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game!<br /><br />Great game! Can't stop playing.  Ads not to bad. Very addictive game.  Would recommend to friends.  Need more games like this.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|This film gives boring a whole new dimension. It's really badly scripted. Teen mush film with no plot or story line and no point or purpose to the story and so unbelievable - full of holes in the story. Even worse is the annoying narration by the main character talking to \\"her other self\\" internally. Can't say how bad it was - even my 11 year old offered to leave about halfway thru, but we stayed, regrettably. I wouldn't watch it again if they paid me.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We've watched Serenity several times since I got it thru Amazon a few weeks ago! What a treasure! Best movie I've seen in a very long time! It has EVERYTHING ...one of the best casts, plots and sub plots, sp.efx., and ,of course...humor...as the series, keep watching, you'll constantly see something you didn't catch the first...or tenth time!  PLEASE, Joss...keep on sending the Serenity signal !  An avid fan.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|What's not to like, Cat and Bones chemistry is brilliant.  Is better than the first book which was great, must read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just &#34;discovered&#34; Firefly and Serenity...missed it on airing because of my remote location, I didn't get the station. Can't believe they didn't pick it up!!! Didn't &#34;they&#34; learn anything from canning &#34;Star Trek&#34;??? I was one of the irate teenagers who wrote nasty letters about that!  I sincerely hope Joss and company keep on &#34;sending the signal&#34; I, for one (amoung many) will be listening and watching....BRAVO!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Fantastic app with a bunch of choices and combinations. Even better, I got it while it was the free app of the day! Score!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is amazing.When I first got it I thought it would be easy. But it pretty challenging.If your one of those people who like a good challenge, I highly recommend this for you.It is AWESOME!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is an exceptional writer and this book does not disappoint.<br />I read it in two nights and couldn't put it down. I loved the twist in the end.
1451696191|5.0|A touching, honest, and saddening account of a boy entering high school and learning about the world around him, Chbosky paints an intricate picture of lovable protagonist Charlie. Charlie is an outcast trying to make his way on the fringes of high school society and all the drama that this environment brings. He is thrust into this world of high school without his best friend Michael, whom we soon learn took his own life before entering high school. Because of this and other situations we don't learn about until the end of the book, Charlie has a tough time relating to people in the moment. However, Charlie's introspective mind gives him wisdom beyond his years.<br /><br />Through letters to an anonymous person, Charlie relays his life's experiences in candid, often humorous detail. The honesty about growing up and figuring out the world during adolescence is something we can all relate to and this is where Chbosky knocks the ball out of the park. Even if you didn't experience the same situations as Charlie, you are sure to find at least something that is familiar: heartbreak, confusion, sadness, joy, feeling \\"infinite,\\" laughter. It's all there in the form of something so personal and deep that it makes you want to laugh and cry all at the same time.<br /><br />Read this book today, you won't soon forget it!
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This movie reminded me of HR PUFFNSTUFF and witchy poo. I guess it's a fair children's movie. I'm glad I rented it and not bought it. Hollywood or whomever will never make a film like the original WIZARD OF OZ, it's one of a kind!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this novel. It's gets better with each NOVEL. Can't wait for the next NOVEL to come out I hope it will be so. :)
B001TH16DI|5.0|although not shot in HD, these disks are better then the original dvd's  extra content for the deep rooted affection.  Love the captains discussion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. I wish it had more levels. My granddaughter and I played this one together. I got hung up on the last level but tapped on the color`s needed to escape. Enjoy.
B0040GR01M|4.0|i liked it. because it was three days grace and a great album. what could i say, if you like them or not it was a pertty good album.
0061692034|2.0|I've seldom read a book that annoyed me as much as this book did. It reminded me a bit of a hiking trail in France we once went on based on the glowing description in the town's tourist office. It started out very promising, with a parking lot and a professional-looking wooden sign, and the first part was indeed very pretty and inviting, but slowly the trail became more and more cluttered, with high weeds and no visible trail, going into an ever darker forest and past some strange-looking shacks. It led nowhere, and finally we turned around.<br /><br />I would have a hard time to tell anyone what this book is about. At first I thought it was a coming-of-age novel, as it appeared to be told from the point of view and in the language of an adolescent (the narrator using \\"would've's\\" and \\"should've's\\" and some grammatical errors such as \\"take\\" for \\"took\\"), and the jaunty, humorous way it was told appealed to me.<br /><br />The second part then starts to read more like a dark mystery. The jauntiness gives way to morosity, and the repetition, needless description and lack of any direction begin to seriously unnerve. I kept thinking: \\"this has to lead somewhere.\\"<br /><br />The third part of the novel simply sinks into what I can only call a black hole. Then the reader discovers in bafflement that the story is actually being told by a 66-year old English teacher! You really have to scratch your head in disbelief that this person, who was so keen to describe the details of every item in a room or how people were dressed or looked, would just drop them all like he did, and go on to lead a life that appears to have been happy and normal but by and large uneventful. Or that he could have such a lack of curiousity about what was driving those closest to him. The guy is a bit like a duck in water: everything just seems to flow over and around him, having little effect, bad or good.<br /><br />No one in this book ever develops or arrives at any kind of enlightenment. They all end up as one-dimensional as they start out: the handsome father is kind but a fool, the plain mother is smart but makes poor choices, the unattractive sister is rebellious but weak, the disgusting Charly sly but perverted, the intriguing A.R. ambitious but unscrupulous, and the insipid narrator good but naïve. We never find out what really went on in any one of their lives, or why they do what they do or why they have become the people they become.<br /><br />Then there are the unlikely scenes and actions which beg to have a follow-up somewhere, but which are simply rabbit trails again leading no where. What was the purpose of the incest scene?  Why would his mother wear a wool suit in the summer? Why did she send him off to a man in Canada whom she didn't know?<br /><br />I don't demand that a good book tug at my heart strings or poke at my tear ducts, but I do expect it to involve me emotionally in some way. This book did not.
B0026PA05M|4.0|i haven't listen to, too much of there stuff so i don't have much to base if i like it better than there other stuff.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|Wonderful storyline and plot.  Acting great and very real outcomes.  Would recommend it for a quick moving and enjoyable movie
B000FBJF7I|5.0|These No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books are delightful. N easy read and a story line that keeps you coming back for more.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to play this .  Great game.  A good way to pass the time.  I do not refer things I know what I like and that is all that counts.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love anything Stephen King writes..I have been a fan of his work for more than 25<br />Years...getting my kindle gives me the opportunity to read any of his books by just tap ping my stylus..love it
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it is ok i just got one it so all i see so far is people with nothing better to do .  I only got on to see my boy's when they went on vacation.  But i will deal with it now.  I only go one now and then .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I very seldom play games but this is really fun. Different from most other games. Amazon app store makes it so easy to install.
B000002TYX|3.0|I was ok with the purchase.  I did not realize it that most of the songs were the Beatles live, rather than the recorded version.
0811806405|5.0|Excellent instruction book, not for the beginner at woodworking, but then neither is a guitar project.<br />But if you have successfully completed some other projects and want to get into your very own guitar, this book is very complete. I found answers to all the questions I had. And detailed instructions for steps that I wouldn't have thought were as complicated or critical to final performance. And by detailed I mean that the complicated steps were very well explained.<br />I had checked this out from the public library twice before I bought it; I will be referring to it frequently on my first build this summer, and hopefully many more.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Kindle sent it to me to charge my Kindle. This works well,and I am grateful to have it. Great customer service Amazon.
B001VNB54A|2.0|It was with great anticipation we purchased this blu-ray set having previously viewed the excellent BOB series.  This review is not meant to compare the series except in one area.  Apart from some PG-13 language and realistic war images, I could comfortably watch all episodes of BOB. Not so with 'The Pacific'.  We made it through the first four episodes before tiring of repeated f-words and nudity coupled with explicit sex scenes.  Had the packaging warned us of the R-rated material we probably would not have purchased.  While the BOB episodes are certainly not free of their 'moments', The Pacific wears out the f-bomb early and often, and the needless sex scenes are, well, needless.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|The book was gripping - didn't want to put it down. Dan Brown did a good job of juggling simultaneous events in this thriller. Plus just enough twists in the plot to make you pay attention.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|The movie itself is wonderful.<br />However the internet transmission was very pitiful slow. It took me over 6 hours to watch it once. I have a very fast 4G internet service, which it was not the cause.<br /><br />Thank you
B006RXQDH8|5.0|It happened that we want to revisit the classic scenes in a weekend afternoon, the Amazon Video provides a good way to get it ASAP. and the movie is classic.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is good for all ages and is very fun to play. I do recommend child supervision because of in game purchases.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy plotlines....pay attention at all times!. Will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Depth of characters is superb
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great way to make yourself think. It is a great game. I just wish there were more levels though
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Writing style keeps you turning pages. Author gives enough information to keep reader looking and guessing though the next clue. Go Rook.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|The game is okay....but it just plays stupidly. You have to work it strand by strand. It's just not that good.
B00782O7NE|5.0|And my collection is pretty vast.  I bought this on a whim; a friend had seen it and said I might want to check it out.  I'd planned on renting it, but now I'm glad I didn't.  We brought silent films into the new age!<br /><br />It's a great story.  Truly great.  The fact that there's no sound initially threw me, as I'm 28 and I had never seen a silent film before, but when I watched it, I was genuinely surprised at how easy it was to follow the story.  Jean Dujardin is amazing in it.  What's funny is as I understand it, he's kind of a nobody from European TV.  Clearly he needs to make some more films, since this one was so good.<br /><br />It's definitely worth owning.  So happy with my purchase on this movie.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I was hoping for bigger games and more layers.  Now I have to buy more to keep the fun and challenge going
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was kind of hard to read towards the end becuase it really sounded like totally different characters then the other two books. Eva was not as jealous and Gideon was all over the place. I love that they took their relationship to the next step but something was missing and I could not pin point what it was. I will still conitnue the journey with following on reading the next books.. Cant wait.
B003E74B06|5.0|it is a book that you canget lost in for hours and it adds in the background of the preson
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|Great album by an amazing band! you won't be disappointed. my favorite track is thoughts by a window seat. All around awesome. buy it. now.
B009LGO88E|5.0|the circle pad pro for the 3ds xl may look stupid like its predecessor for 3ds but it still is very functional and in my opinion pretty rad. It gives better support hen holding the system and it gives a more controller like fell to it. I say its another good accessory to the system. where as the ps vita doesn't have too many that are really unique. This coming from someone who owns both systems and enjoys gaming
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is the best game.You can change  vehicles and courses .You can ride a motorcycle . This game is the funniest game ever
B0035JRVBO|5.0|One of the best all time movies for adults and kids. They do not get any better over all. I would see it again.
B00355L2TU|5.0|My wife does this workout every morning and loves it.  She now wants the second season just to break up the monotony.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book. Currently on the third book. I decided to read after seeing the movie preview. Glad I did. I was just e expecting Sc-Fi and got a much more complete story.
B00821PCJS|5.0|What a great series..I don't have cable @ home, but I do have Amazon Prime.  This airs on TNT and I would have  missed out.  Noah (aka Doc Carter) is awesome in this! It is action packed, survivor skills oriented, very addicting. After recently experiencing a tornado in our area...power outage, etc...you realize how much you need to be more prepared in case of emergency.  This series was interesting because, although fictional, it shows you the need to have some backup ready if you have no power, no food, and in the event aliens attack the earth :)  The whole cast is great...love the Mason clan, no nonsense Weaver and of course unlikable loveable Pope. Can't wait till season 3 is up for Prime members.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Seems to get a bit repetitive.  But honestly did not play it much.  Not bad but not great.  Have a nice day.
1556347308|5.0|Better than I expected. Long time GURPS fan, played 3rd edition forever. Finally broke down and purchased the 4th edition rules. I was not disappointed. The updated rules and the quality of the book are outstanding. By far the best table top RPG on the market today. If you enjoy RPGs and are tired of &#34;character classes&#34; and &#34;experience levels&#34; then move up to the best: GURPS 4th edition.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is elegant, interesting, exciting, a little spooky, challenging and thought-provoking. We can't wait for a sequel. It's aces.

B004SIP9VA|5.0|this slow dreamy story is something that my husband would have done. Good actors and really liked the dancing, pretty costumes.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Enjoyed it very much, great look back at history. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history, plus great acting.
B0091REZMW|3.0|pretty good game. plenty of levels. spend lots of time playing. energy recovery could be faster. all in all a joy to play
B009AMANBA|4.0|An excellent portrayal of very important and significant historical events.  Well acted and produced.Lots of time and effort researching and developing the characters and events. Impressive.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Quick and easy, kids loved the movie and watch it every night, hassle free and convenient!!<br /><br />Would recommend to other buyers.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|A well produced Holmes thriller, in keeping with the Holmes tradition. The excitement and surprises were well done .... and the acting was excellent.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game requires concentration and problem solving skills. I would like to see new levels added soon. I would recommend this game to others.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Excellent production of a significant historical event.  Well produced and acted.  The acting and production relayed the full emotion encountered in the processes.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It is very dramatic and u never know know what to expect.I look forward to seeing it every week.This is a must see
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Thrilling and very exciting.  Well produced.  Even though much occurred in the dark, it was completely visible on screen. Accurate and well documented.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|game is really good. would've liked a way to play just the hidden object part, that's why it got 4 instead of 5. story is ok.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Very exciting production.  All of the events and scenes were extremely well produced. It was a 'true' Bond thriller. Full of excitement and surprises.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This was an okay movie. I did not get to see it at the theatre and so I decided to buy it on bluray. Could have been better but worth the watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it. Can't get enough of it. I'm amxiously waiting for the new season to start. I was so glad I could catch up with the other seasons from amazon before watching this one.
B004QJTCT6|4.0|I decided to watch this and it was a good movie. Just the right amount of everything. Rent it or buy it. Amazon got you covered.
B001H1SVO8|2.0|I thought it was a sorry concept and would only be liked by people who had made sorry choices in life.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Bought this so my wife could use the dock I bought her while her phone stays in her otter box. Works fine.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addicting. Makes you use your brain, exercise your memory and use logic. I just wish you could save your progress throughout or if you leave a level and later return. /
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag far exceeded my expectations. I was not sure by the picture and description how much storage it would have, but when I received it I was more than amazed. The side of the bag is capable of holding my tripod, the inside fits my two cameras (canon t3i and go pro) along with various lenses and chargers. All the compartments are Velcro and interchangeable. I am so pleased with the overall quality of this bag I will be purchasing amazon basic products again in the future.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It is ok as games go...it could be addicting.  I play it on both Kindle Fire and computer.  Kindle does not show tournaments but does give the credits for tournament play.  The Kindle play does not rack up as many points on Bingo as the play from a computer.  The 14.99 a month version appears to rack up points much better both in Bingo and the slots section.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. Challenging and clever, reminiscent of the Myst series of games.  Gorgeous production.  Puzzles were not too terribly difficult.  About two hours of gameplay using one hint. Well worth the $2.  My only complaint is that the game is so short! Hopefully, Fireproof will keep making lovely games like this one.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been active with athletics through my college years and now as a working professional have lost a step physically and mentally.  I'm 34 and about 25lbs overweight.  I've always been a little overweight.  This book opened my eyes to a world so many of us don't even now existed.  I've tried diet after diet that would include really healthy sides with turkey sandwhiches on wheat bread or a spinach wrap.  I'd lose a little weight and then got frustrated because it seemed to just stop.  I didn't understand why and now I know.  I was eating wheat bread, drinking diet soft drinks and it was throwing my glucose levels up and down.  I've been &#34;Wheat&#34; free now for only 10 days and have lost 5 lbs.  My mind is clear and I feel GREAT!  I've stopped drinking wheat based alcohol drinks as well been excercising at least 3-4 times per week.  Here's to the next 10 days and hopefully 10 years of a new lifestyle.  Wheat Free.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have played other versions but this one is the most challenging by far. I really enjoy every moment of it. My kids love it too.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My 4yr old downloaded this on his tablet, asked me for help and now I'm hooked.  Great way to kill some time and keep the noodle active.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed it, and have recommended it to others.  I liked that the author realized how lucky she was to have been aided on her adventure and never harmed.  (Except for the feet)
1585104205|5.0|Once you are at LLPI chapter 20 or so, you need things to read for &#34;fun&#34; (TPRS).  Cornelia by Mima Maxey is a fun Latin story about the adventures of a young girl living in the United States in the early 1900's. The Latin becomes successively more difficult as the chapters progress (there are 40 short chapters in all). And Maxey's &#34;A New Primer&#34; uses the same vocabulary and forms so you can read them together. Other readers in this style are &#34;Julia&#34; and &#34;Camilla&#34; by Maud Reed  and Carolus et Maria Fey At present you have to find it on the net   You really need Exercitatia latina 1, and you need the Teacher's Material for the answers. And Nova exercitia Latina I: by Roberto Carfagni is really great help. See my review.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I haven't read The Hobbit since the '80s, so the creators of this movie may have taken some liberties, not sure.  I'm guessing they did.  My wife and I saw this in the theater when it was released, and frankly I had a hard time being attentive.  Not so at home, we watched this twice on two consecutive evenings and both commented that we really enjoyed it.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I have waited for this game to come down in price on the Play Store. No longer have to wait. As a FAOTD, Amazon did a great job! This game has great strategy and is very responsive. I have an older Galaxy Nexus &amp; it runs smooth :-)
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Didn't hate it, sat through it, but overall it left me wondering when I would just stop taking a chance on this sort of effort.  Not for young kids, by the way.  The great thing about grabbing a movie from Amazon as we did with this one is that it's no longer a big gamble at the theater in terms of cost, so based on that alone I felt it was just OK.  More of a &#34;let's see what they did with this one&#34; sort of movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A world so rich in description you feel you've been there. Could not stop reading it. The people are more than characters in a novel.
B000005EJL|5.0|Yes I certainly love to write a review. Supertramp is a iconic band and this release is no exception, This goes for nearly 80 minutes with every selection is just great.The opener is 10 mins with strong electric piano that is always a feature of supertramp as they are masters with the electric piano.In the 70s they were putting empahis  on the wurlizer and fender Rhodes models.but the wurlizer was really their specialty .My favourite song on this album Iive to  love you more (track 4) a beautiful song  that has a mellotron feel to it after the 1st verse with strings introduced . The songs are blues type with excellent drumming by the Canadian Bob Siebenberg<br />he is one of the best drummers of all time .Very good crispness on the snare and excellent bass drumming .This is one band I have never seen. They came to Australia in 1976 but I missed it .I hope supertramp start their engines with  Rick Davies who has penned fantastic songs from the late sixties to the present. he is beautifully gifted with music and supertramp are so enjoyable listen to .Some Things Never Change is very strong album. It came out 16 years ago in 1997 . Whatever line up  supertramp produces good music .Another great song on this is The Light again electric piano dominates, good bass playing on it. The last song is Where There is a Will a gospel type uplifting song that is so joyous .Rick Davies is a brillant keyboard player. They also good with sythesizers with the oberhiem model being infamous with this band .They bring good string sounds and bass patches of this model and every supertramp album has this (listen to Brother Where You Bound) a review of this album will be penned shortly.I hope supertramp can get to Australia soon because they have a lot of devoted fans and are heavily influenced by a lot of musicians .All the best Rick Davies and supertramp .
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is the first book I've read by this author and I do plan to read her other story, \\"Gone Girl\\" as well.  I found her writing to be detailed and her writing style was easy to follow.  The story content itself as many others stated was pretty dark.  It was a little darker than I personally prefer but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to a friend although I would detail some aspects(which are spoilers so I don't want to include them here.  Writing wise this was a 5star for me but I found Camille's actions, problems and decisions affected the story for me.  One example was towards the end when Camille went with her sister to a party. I can't say more than this as it's a possible spoiler but Camille's actions did detract from the story for me especially after reading the initial progress Camille had been trying to make in years past.  I think the author was trying to have the reader realize the depths of Camille's inner battles which sometimes she lost but for me personally, this was a little \\"too\\" much.  I'd give the characters a 3-4 rating.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Susan George plays a single mother of an autistic child who, we are lead to believe, is at school for the day while she joins a small group of acquaintances for a sail on their sailboat. We are lead to believe a lot of things, and therein lies the surprises and twists! After Susan's character falls asleep for the first couple hours of the sail, she awakes after a nightmare only to be tossed into a real-life nightmare ... once in a blue moon there is a dead calm on the ocean with no wind whatsoever. That occurs right in the face of a fast-approaching storm (a quite nasty looking one). During a tremendous fight to out ride the storm, the sailboat is overturned and one woman is lost...presumed drowned. The rest of the group re-assembles on top of the overturned boat. They are shocked and happy to be found by a cruise ship and quickly climb aboard what appears to be an abandoned ship...or is it?<br />I can't tell anymore without giving away the extremely creative, inventive story line that has some wonderful twists...more than one! This may be a &#34;B&#34; film, but the acting is &#34;A&#34; rated! The actors quickly create character sympathy and you do want to know what will happen to them next. I highly recommend this movie to people who love this genre.
B0076R6MES|4.0|I grew up watching mr bean, so this movie brought back good memories. This is a good movie to watch in any mood.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Lots of action and more than a little predictable but ff you're a Bruce Willis fan it's worth the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. I can't wait to see more games from this developer. Definitely a great way to pass the time.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|as in the title, movie was great, actors great but grainy quality at the beginning of the movie, will try to watch again.
B0018RWMNM|1.0|I received my 1st Blu-ray disc and was blown away because of the night time scenes were very grainy and were flashing. I have been in the video industry for 30 years and have never seen such a poor encoding (transfer) as this one. Amazon said they would send me another copy, I knew the problem was with the master and I was right. Second one was the same. It's a shame that someone would market such trash. Lonesome Dove is the highest rated mini series of all time and watching it sure will ruin your opinion of this great movie. I have returned both copies 3 weeks ago and still have not received a credit,
B0091XRRQC|4.0|My son really liked the movie and he watches over and over again. He saw it at the movies and asked me to buy it for him, it was definetely worth it.
B009XWD02G|1.0|This app is so bad it shouldn't even have been made, its a waste of time, I regret downloading this app
B001F0N0ZG|5.0|I am always been a fun of the series and I really enjoyed the sequel. I will recomend it to anyone but you have to be a lover of the series to truly enjoy the movie.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's fun and keeps ya thinking and occupies you for a good while. And takes away your boredom ha! But very glad I found it and thanks Amazon for the freebe
B003ZJ23XU|5.0|I watched all the seasons of the series and I really like the movie. I laughed a lot and I think the movie show a bit of what women go through during break ups.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game, but where did everyone go on multiplayer? One day there are a 100 people, the next im lucky if there are 10, been like that ever since
B00A1C17EK|5.0|If you love Shakespeare you will love the series not only do you get some great plays but amazing actors and actresses. If you love Jeremy Irons or Tom Hiddleston as much as I do you will love this series. As a Theatre Geek or Thespian which ever you choose, I absolutely loved this series and I'm sure anyone who is into Theatre will as well.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I personally think that this game is amazing! Another great game from halfbrick studios, including Fruit ninja. The only problem is it takes a while to build up coins.
1907661719|5.0|I'm a student of Stoic pantheism. Though there were other philosophers before Marcus Aurelius, his work particularly is quite universal. The words of this book and the wisdom within can almost be interpreted as mystic and Buddhist. The book itself has a nice binding, and its simple without added unnecessary content. I liked it!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I'm a big music fan, and I LOVE this CD.  Especially love the guitar dual harmonics.  The band sounds fired up.
B000YABIQ6|1.0|i did not like this soap opera. i gess the writers think every one is too stupid to like some thing positive.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I didn't like the going back and forth in time from one chapter to the next and even within a chapter.  I had to write down the time frame for the chapters and also the names of the characters as they would disappear only to return later in the book (or not).  In chapter 9 I had to get five pages into the chapter (on my kindle) to find out who the characters were.  It might have been easier if I had had the paper copy instead of the kindle, but I still would have had the same complaints
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think you should be able to use your PC account to get the app, or at least have a pocket edition account. I don't want to have to buy this app a third time.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Starts of with you disliking the main character but you kinda learn to like him in a morally incorrect way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am only on the 4th floor and I already feel challenged.  Don't let the simple graphics fool you. I like using my brain. It's fun! Just make sure to touch everything or you will miss something.
1401324649|5.0|It's easy to see why the book is an international sensation! The author uses history, infamous communist villains and vodka to make your head spin.<br />The hero is a mild mannered explosives expert who alters the course of history in spite of detention in jail, the gulag and the old folks home.<br />Thrill to his friendship with Einstein's clueless brother and other misfits as he gets his pursuers off track and befuddled.<br />I congratulate Rod Bradbury, translator.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Plays great on my Note 2. Only glitch I have found is the combat animation will not turn off. Outside of that, we'll worth every penny. Thank you very much!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Finally, we again have music that sounds like it was created by Queensryche the BAND, and not just one self-absorbed member.  Nowadays, with music shuffle, I rarely listen to entire albums at one time.  I have already listened to this  new album multiple times over the past week, and it's only getting better.  I haven't done that since Promised Land.  We now know where the decline of QR was caused, and the boys have taken a risk and fixed the problem.  I say buy this album for your friends, make the court's decision easy, and let's start hounding these guys for the next album no later than this time next year when there WILL be only one true Queensryche.  This is their new album.  Ignore Frequency Unknown and Dedicated To Chaos as the Geoff Tate solo efforts they clearly were.  Watch the sales of a real QR album surprise the industry.
B005HEDI3K|3.0|this is a program that most people like very much.  As for me, the first time was very good.  The reruns, not so good.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A fascinating book for sure, but I would have preferred more written about his Near Death Experience and less about his medical condition. It was established that he got very sick and should have died, but I bought the book to find out about Heaven. Needed more.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing. I'd actually seen the series before reading the books but I decided to put the show on hold and actually get into the series and I can honestly say the show doesn't do it justice. I'd recommend this book to all fantasy fiction fans
B006M4F67A|5.0|Game is fun and squares are pretty.  Keeps you busy and interested. I am glad this was made available for the kindle
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I was skeptical about this movie given its box office performance but found it to be very entertaining.  I've already recommended it to several others.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Never knew anything about him before.  I am now reading about the Chicago World's Fair that he helped light up!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|For the most part, the story line was very good and a fairly quick read.  The ending, however, was unpredictable.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This has always been my favorite Star Trek movie. Ricardo Montalban turns in a stellar performance as Khan. Shatner was much better in this one than the first Star Trek. Better costumes also.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I also like masterpiece's show upstairs downstairs, which gives a window to a period of great change, of a world long gone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This brain game offers fun exercise for your grey matter.  Only worked through the first four floors,  but having a great time working through the puzzles.  Anxious to get back to the game.  Enjoy!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Stargate atlantis is the very best of the stargates.  It brings in all the things my family looks for in a sci fi series.  Good morality, some action,  some depth and characters you just love.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Again, I could not put this down, it was recommended by my book club. everyone who has read it loves it.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Stargate atlantis is the very best of the stargates.  It brings in all the things my family looks for in a sci fi series.  Good morality, some action,  some depth and characters you just love.
1781162646|4.0|Although this book was somewhat slow moving in some places I'm giving it 4 stars. I cried like a little baby at the end. King can not just scare the pants off you (this was not a scary book though) he can also induce all of your sentimentality and leave you in ruins. I liked that about this book. I'd definitely recommend it to any hard core King fans.
1476734941|5.0|I love this book. I love this diet. I just got the book on Sunday and didn't even finish it and did my first fast day on Monday. I'm a gal who cannot stick to any diet, and hates to feel deprived, but my first fast day was easy-breezy, and I didn't even do the entire 500 calories. All I kept thinking was, \\"I can have anything I want tomorrow,\\" and when Tuesday came, I didn't want a lot... my body had stopped craving the amount of sugar/carbs, and it's been a second great day of eating healthy. I love this concept. And I love the entertaining manner the authors explain the way this diet (or lifestyle) works. If I lose weight, I will be on this diet forever. Plus the health benefits make this great for not just beauty, but for longer, healthy life. This program may transform the way people lose weight forever.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I have seen all the versions prior, this is one of the best  Love Jonny Lee Miller and liked the actress playing Emma.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|I recently reread the book so that may be the reason that I did not like the movie as well as I had hoped.  The cast is amazing, but I felt like the movie did not adequately capture the jazz age type feeling that you get from the book. I kept feeling like the actors were in the 70s playing parts in the 20s. I was never truly captured by this rendition of the story.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|excellent actors reminding us that love and connectedness matter even though the world has gone to hell and that women can be heroes too.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I will freely admit I am not a video-game fan, and my five year old son had to show me how to do this game! I like the music and the sounds when the tiles are matched.  This is actually one of his favorite games, so thank you for the unique set-up and allowing my son to exercise his mind without even realizing he's doing it!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|if you've only watched the latest version of this movie you've missed out on how funny it really is. the brits just add so much more color and humor.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I loved this movie it was very enjoyable to watch, I will tell everyone about how good this movie is.  Thank you, Gloria E.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Well worth the time watching it. For some of the older action heros, their comeback films are not so great [can you say Steven Segal?], but for Arnold this was a great action movie.
B0024R1QU0|5.0|I loved watching this movie had some laughs in it and that I enjoy doing,  I will tell very one I can to get it.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|I can't decide whether I like it or it's just a bit cheesy. on the fence. You'll have to see it for yourself and make up your own mind.
B0011Z102K|5.0|This album is one of the few in my entire collection that I can honestly say that I can listen to all the way through and never skip a track. Having the amended version was perfect for me and my younger siblings. I love how the entire album seems to tell a story and would recommend it to everyone who likes rock/punk rock. It's a great purchase and I'm extremely glad to have it in my inventory!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A challenging game that tests the reasoning skills. I'm 64 & I needed my 9 year old grandson Jaxon to teach me the ropes. We had a blast together.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging exercises your problem solving skills. Not so difficult that it is frustrating but hard enough to keep you engaged.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|This Howleen is a neon dream, from her day-glo hot pink tresses to her outfit to her pet.  It sounds like Howleen will be the star of the show in a quest for popularity for the upcoming new 13 Wishes Monster High tale - and her wish fulfillment makeover is a lot of fun.  Howleen is the same size (smaller scale MH doll) and still has one floppy werewolf ear and clawed hands.  As mentioned, her hair is a couple of shades of neon and cotton candy pink, it is long and silky and she has bangs. Howleen has bright orange eyes, purple eye makeup and hot pink lips.  She is wearing an 80's flashback mini dress with bright patterns that include paw prints and the dress is trimmed in neon chartreuse.  She has fluorescent pink tights, a deep plum colored leather jacket and high heeled black motorcycle boots that are trimmed with gold studs.  Her blue belt has the same studs.  Howleen is wearing one glove, some chunky bracelets and a knit cap.  Her other accessory is a gold handbag.<br /><br />If you missed out on the first version of Howleen - now is your chance to collect a super cute version of her with her pet hedgehog named Cushion.  (Personally, I love the pets that come with some of the dolls.)  This version of Cushion is neon pink to match Howleen's hair (so far her pet always matches her haircolor).  She also comes with a diary, hairbrush and doll stand.  This is a punky fun little doll that I am sure collectors will love.
B009T1IZ44|4.0|I like this book mostly because it is realistic and funny. The amusing and pathetic parts of Greg's life kept me laughing. However, I really struggled to relate at the moments when he was self absorbed. Only 4 stars. Worth buying, but only if you can read about selfish people.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)<br /><br />Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under \\"normie\\" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.<br /><br />I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I don't watch many of the new movies, but this one has great characters, an outstanding storyline and fine acting.
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|If you are a Monster High fan that loves variation in design - then this is the doll for you! Lagoona is barely recognizable in her freshwater incarnation.  This Lagoona has cerulean blue skin and day-glo easter egg yellow hair.  In this version Lagoona has short bangs with a swatch of mint green, while the rest of her neon hair is styled into a unicorn twist that ends in a fish tail.  Lagoona has green eyes, with purple brows and some fabulous bright mint green lipstick.<br /><br />If you missed out on the original Lagoona doll, now is a chance to collect her and her pet fish Neptuna.  Neptuna is two shades of purple and her fishbowl is included as one of Lagoona's accessories.  Other accessories include a pink flower for Lagoona's hair, a large face visor with a woodland pond theme, pink dragonfly earrings, pond/cattail themed high hell shoes and green turtle themed necklace and bracelet.  Lagoona is wearing a mostly pink and black geo patterned mini dress with a teal/pink glitter one sleeved overlay.<br /><br />Besides her pet, this doll comes with her diary, a hairbrush and doll stand.  I think collectors will be thrilled with this unusual doll, and will love the unique restyling of Lagoona - she really looks different and fresh.
1455519006|5.0|Good book easy read read almost the whole thing the first day, I will absolutely read more of his books!!
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie kind of destroyed me, to be honest! But in a great way. Benedict Cumberbatch was wonderful, as always!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Loved this game,I though it was some boring game just to waste time but I found myself smiling and having fun,lots of fun.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Nice features and good layouts. Not glitchy at all. Lots of levels. Pretty tile designs. I am happy with this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games so much I love it spool much I play it all day long <3 I play it when I'm in the car this games is sooooooo cool

055338466X|2.0|My curiosity was well peaked when I heard Stephen Hawking co-authored this book trying to deal with some of life's biggest questions.  Having been informed of his conclusions through the media, I wanted to see how he built his argument.<br /><br />Sadly, this notable theoretical physicist is a much better scientist than he is a philosopher--his philosophy and logic absolutely stink!<br /><br />I rated the book two stars because of Hawking's ability to take the complicated concepts of quantum physics and translate them into a language that is easily understandable.  I very much enjoyed his journey through the Feynman Diagrams as well as his strong anthropic argument regarding the fine tuning of the universe.  But his conclusions regarding things are quite illogical and downright absurd.<br /><br />For instance, Hawking believes in scientific determinism--which requires a closed system and universe; however, he also lifts up the fact that in quantum mechanics things are not governed by certainty but probability.  He also works very hard to show the universe is not a closed system by asserting that it had no beginning, at least in the dimension of time.  Hawking tries to have it both ways when it is logically impossible.<br /><br />He also asserts that because there is a law of gravity the universe can and will create itself.  If one can manage to get past the absurdity of the thought of an entity actually creating itself, one must then deal with Hawking's assertion that M-theory allows for up to 10^500 possible universes with different or even possibly non-existent laws.  How can one assert that because a law of gravity in our universe exists, the universe can create itself when that law is different or non-existent in other universes?  Wouldn't they need the law of gravity as well to create themselves?<br /><br />These are just two examples in a book rife with illogical statements.  If you buy, read it for Hawking's ability to articulate the science but not for its philosophy and attempt to answer life's greatest questions.  He doesn't even come close to answering them.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app Works great and it has plenty of options so you can perform many types calculations plus its free!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Love the Godfather movies.  I've seen them many times and always enjoy them.  Couldn't resist this deal on the blu-ray.  WIll enjoy them for years to come.
B000FC1CUA|5.0|This is a fascinating story about the degradation of a man's soul. Dorian Gray is granted a wish that he should enjoy eternal youth while a portrait of him ages and withers in his stead. As Dorian becomes corrupted and stained by sin it is the portrait, rather than he himself which reveals the loathsome truth of his soul. The book is highly intellectual, exploring the intricacies of humanity yet at the same time keeping the reader engaged and hungry for more. I would recommend this book to anyone who can handle the grim and depressing and who has an appetite for some fascinating insights about human weakness.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Awesome Cgi.  There aren't too many movies that can compete without going overboard and mixing elements from other movies to make it work.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I so enjoyed Mr Hosseini's previous novels that I couldn't buy this one fast enough.  I did enjoy the book.  Mr. Hosseini is an excellent writer.  His discriptions put me in Afganistan, and I developed a visual picture of all of his characters.  However, I felt as if I knew what would happen before he wrote about it.  I think this came from having read his previous novels.  I was disappointed in the predictability of the novel but did still feel it was a good read.
0865479410|3.0|The author proposes that the aggressive, American-style promotion of positive thinking during the last decade or so has done more harm than good in that it has encouraged too many people, and too many corporate organizations to ignore clear signs of impending failure, collapse and disaster. The author is probably right.<br /><br />This is a light, popular read. The author is a world-class journalist who has done his research and assembled it to make his point in a convincing way. I found the style irritatingly journalistic, and I was sorely tempted to abandon the book halfway through. To my mind the style smacks too much of a deliberate intention to write a popular documentary best-seller. An in-depth study would have been more valuable, but probably not as much fun.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have finished this book in 3 days. At first it was disturbing but I kept getting deeper into it and understanding what's underneath. I could feel the main character's emotions as I read each one. When she was happy, I was happy; when she was sad, I was sad. This book is amazing. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Really enjoying this release....obviously miss Carl and Denny, but they still sound great. My only complaint if you can call it that is that &#34;Don't worry Baby&#34; wasn't included.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Funny but it was my grand-son who wanted me to get this game. He is 6 and he played it for a long time. He loved changing the hair color and using the clippers to shave the head.It would probably be an awesome game for little girls. I'll let my one and only granddaughter (age 5) try it next.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is prolly my second favorite Queens of the Stone Age album after that album that was made to sound like you were listening to the radio, you know? It was the pink one with a pitchfork on the cover (Songs For The Deaf?). I like this one a lot cuz it is just filled with groovy tunes that are pretty great to listen to while driving in your car, especially at night. If you don't have a car then I guess it would also be good for biking but not at night unless you have a light on your bike cuz it can be dangerous. Always wear  a helmet.

0800141660|5.0|This is my very favorite version of Sense & Sensibility. My friends think I'm crazy for having such a crush on 67-year-old Alan Rickman, since they only know him as Severus Snape. But I defy any woman to watch his turn as Colonel Brandon and not come away at least a little in love.<br /><br />On the subject of Harry Potter: If you are a fan, I highly encourage you to see this, even if the genre usually isn't your bag. It's worth it to see Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) as the daughter of Madam Pomfrey (Gemma Jones); the original Fat Lady (the late, great Elizabeth Spriggs), who gossips with Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and is the mother of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton...who is surprisingly likeable here as a funny, shallow, vapid woman of the time); and, of course, the aforementioned Professor Snape (the honey-voiced, unrivaled Alan Rickman).<br /><br />For House fans: Hugh Laurie is well cast as the long-suffering and acidly humorous Mr. Palmer, husband of Imelda Staunton's Charlotte Jennings Palmer. Bonus: He gets to use his real accent!<br /><br />This is a bit of perfection all around...give it a try and you won't be sorry!

039334505X|4.0|This book is a must read for Welsh fans.  If you read the cover, you know how it starts, and if you read or saw Trainspotting, you know how it ends, so it would be hard to give any spoilers even if I were inclined to.<br /><br />The central story is the decline of Mark Renton, who starts out as a university student with a wonderful girlfriend and a real shot at \\"getting out\\" and ends up, well, you know.  That theme is compelling, but the book also cycles through vignettes of the other main characters: Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie, as well as several other peripheral characters.  With the exception of Begbie - who is a constant through all three books - they all \\"fall\\", but since they don't have as far to fall as Renton, they pretty quickly end up in the state you meet them in Trainspotting.  The stories are poignant and well written, but after a while, I did find that they became a bit repetitive, and it became a bit of a slog to get to the end - particularly, as I said, when I knew pretty much what the end was going to be.  Personally, I think it would have been more effective if it had been pruned a bit.<br /><br />Much has been said about the phonetic dialectic writing.  I only saw the movie Trainspotting, but if I remember Porno correctly, he only used dialectic writing for some characters (Spud?).  In this book, it's most characters.  I'm pretty ambivalent about it.  I think it adds a bit of flavor, but on the other hand, I would have been happy for him to only use it when someone was talking.  Since he used it for everything, I eventually just stopeed noticing.<br /><br />So definitely well worth reading, but you may find yourself skimming in places.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|I loved the clever dialogue, characters, and the story line. I enjoyed it so much I played it several times. It makes you pay attention and think about strategy. Not a game you can win while doing something else.

B002PEP4SC|5.0|Disclaimer: first I have to confess that I'm a huge fan of the TV show \\"Castle\\" - love the writing and the actors involved.<br /><br />But ... since this book (and subsequent ones) were written by ghost writers, I wasn't sure what to expect. For those who aren't familiar with the hit TV series, Richard Castle is a fictional character so who wrote this book? Anybody's guess.<br /><br />What I got was PURE, CONSTANT AND DELIGHTFUL crime drama with a nice mix of romance. The book was an easy-read with wonderful character description and great emotional and sensual scenes between Rook and Heat. The plot and climax were played nicely right up to the end ... left the reader clamoring for more details so you could pretend to be in the bull pen assisting with the investigation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crime drama with some flirtatious, dry humor thrown in for good measure ... and I'm on to the next in the series myself.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Memories reverberating like echoes in the mountains!  Set initially in Afghanistan, then France, Greece, America, and finally back to France, the main characters, an older brother, Abdullah, and his baby sister whom he has taken care of like a father ever since the mother dies, are separated when Pari is sold to a rich family in Kabul.  This enables the poor family to survive.  Pari, a baby, soon forgets her Shadbagh family, but Abdullah never does.  Yet Pari throughout her life always feels as though something is missing.<br /><br />I found this novel an enjoyable read but often had to exert much effort distinguishing between the multiple narrators.  With THE KITE RUNNER and A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS Khaled Hosseini became known as a gifted writer, and he has done it again with AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED.

B00001NTXN|5.0|I came across this game in the store where the clerk asked if I would like to play. I was instantly sold.  Simple rules but still a great strategy game.  My friends and I have added a 20 sided dice to add a little bit of luck and randomness.  This is how we play.<br />All dice values on the die represent a single turn except the following.<br />1 = loss of turn<br />10 = lets you move your opponents pawn or set one of their walls against them.<br />20 = bonus moves.  You get 2 moves instead of one.  In any combination.  Such as move your pawn 2 spaces, move your pawn 1 space and opponents pawn 1 space, move opponent pawn once and use one of their walls against them. etc. Its really fun to screw your opponent with 2 moves. Lots of frustration and excitement will be had.<br /><br />The die really adds a dynamic side to the game.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|With the exception of the title track, the project is one of the new AIC's best. Duvall shines and Jerry's solos are excellent. The bass licks are really good and there are several tracks that aren't in standard rhythms. The addition of a true second guitar shows on this album. It's heavier than prior AIC - but you're going to get the same dark, almost sick feeling you get from this band. The standard Eb tuning keeps AIC, well, AIC. As a side note, there's a line in the title track that is disturbing - that Jesus hates the queers - and that's so not true. Outside of that one stupid, moronic statement, the CD is very good. Can't rate it a 5 - especially with the title track being so &#34;off&#34;.

B00BSO2U1Y|4.0|In the spirit of honesty, I will say, upfront, that I am a fan of Cecilia Bartoli, but I usually make a point of not reviewing her work because of the polarizing attitudes that she inspires.  Bartoli will never lack fans to sing her praises, but there is a vocal element that disparages anything she produces simply as a matter of routine.  I don't see the point of writing a review simply to watch it be eviscerated by her detractors.  Even as a fan, I will admit that there are elements of Bartoli's artistry that don't appeal to all quarters, and that is fine.  What confuses me, though, is why someone would even bother purchasing an album featuring a singer for whom one has nothing but contempt, unless the only purpose is to justify an automatic, negative response.<br /><br />The public response to this new recording of Bellini's \\"Norma\\" is varied, and in some cases quite rabid, but I feel many folks are simply not giving the recording a chance.  When, in the foreseeable future, will a major recording company undertake another studio recording of \\"Norma?\\"  Why not give this one a fair shake before simply dismissing it for its association with Cecilia Bartoli? But, anyway, on with the review...<br /><br />Anyone seeking to understand why the pitch is lowered to 430 Hz or why the smaller Orchestra La Scintilla is employed in the recording can read the liner notes for the full reasoning, but we're engaged by the artists to listen with fresh ears to get a better understanding of what a historically informed performance of \\"Norma\\" would have sounded like to Bellini and his contemporaries.  Detractors who dislike the effect lay the blame squarely at the feet of Madame Bartoli, but let's remember that Ricardo Minasi, the noted conductor and violinist, and the musicologist Maurizio Biondi also studied the composer's autograph score in a combined effort to achieve a new understanding of \\"Norma.\\"  To me, the effect is quite stunning.  The reduced orchestra brings out all manner of new details that one can't hear with a larger group.  The strings are gorgeous: they have a certain juicy ping that can be alternatively aggressive and bright or fresh.  The transverse flute obbligato during \\"Casta Diva\\" is stunning, and each time it crops up in the performance I found myself leaning in for a better listen to this effect. La Scintilla may be a period band, but there is nothing musty about their work here; the performance has verve, to say the least.  Giovanni Antonini keeps things rolling, and I've noticed quite a few folks take issue with the tempo choices, but I find most of them fairly appropriate.  Yes, \\"Sediziose voci\\" is a touch fast, but \\"Casta Diva\\" is practically a calm pool, and I find it helps to distinguish the varying emotions (the druid priestess assembling her gathering is a tougher woman than the one praying to the moon...).<br /><br />Michele Pertusi has the thankless task of singing Oroveso.  Usually, a basso-profundo who can show up and get through a rather blowsy role is considered a success, but Pertusi has an easier way about him.  The smoothly produced bass-baritone voice wraps around Bellini's music with apparent comfort (unsurprising given Pertusi's bel-canto background).  Pertusi brings a more youthful sound to Oroveso than one might usually associate with the mother of our priestess, but this seems apt.  Most of the thundering bassos that undertake the role sound quite ancient, and this makes sense as the revered leader of the druids, but a younger sound makes one see Oroveso in a more human light.  He is not an untouchable, noble figurehead, but rather a man conflicted by the dueling roles of fatherhood and leadership.  It makes the finale, where Oroveso accepts Norma's pleas to save her children before going to the fire, all the more heartbreaking: this is a father buckling under the weight of a family torn apart, not a stoic Chief deigning to spare his grandchildren as their mother goes to the flames.  Pertusi's comfort with florid music makes Orovesi's parts less dreary, and his Italian diction raises the musical standard in this production.<br /><br />Given that we're used to recordings and performances of \\"Norma\\" with orchestras big enough for \\"Il trovatore,\\" it's no surprise that our notable Polliones can easily double for Manrico.  Franco Corelli, Placido Domingo, John Alexander, Luciano Pavarotti, Mario Del Monaco, Jon Vickers, etc have all played their dashing Roman soldier to the hilt.  A big sound was our usual compensation for having singers who couldn't always mesh with the coloratura in Pollione's vocal line.  It's hard to sympathize with his romantic misadventures when Pollione sounds, more often than not, like a bully, brow-beating both his druid mistress and virgin lover.  John Osborn's tenor is far more flexible than most singers who take on the Roman; he is certainly closer to a lyric tenor than any of the previously listed gentleman.  So, one quite enjoys the full opening cabaletta, uncut for once, though a note here or there does sound a trifle pinched.  Osborn makes a compelling love interest for both of our druid ladies, and manages to make him more of a two-dimensional character.  Despite the usual, aggressive romancing that Adalgisa suffers at the hands of Pollione, Osborn goes beyond most singers and really works to make his final conversion to repentance believable.  I'm not sure I love the basic sound of the voice, but Osborn employs it in a way that makes him a compelling artist.<br /><br />It's rare that we get a soprano Adalgisa; more often than not there is a thundering mezzo who wanted a night off from Azucena, Eboli or Amneris.  The result is usually a bit jarring: a matronly virgin stealing away the Roman lover from a prima donna.  It's not the most vocally appropriate choice, to me at least.  Montserrat Caball&eacute; sang a soprano Adalgisa in Sutherland's second studio recording, and Eva Mei sang a soprano Adalgisa to Jane Eaglen's Norma, but both recordings are marred: the first by the Sutherland's and Caball&eacute;'s; age and diminished vocal health, and the second by the ungainly heft/lack of flexibility apparent in both Eaglen's voice and Muti's conducting.  I was most surprised by the casting of Sumi Jo as Adalgisa.  I have nothing against Jo, per se, but I hadn't heard much from or about her in ages.  Would there be enough of a voice left for her to sing Adalgisa - especially after all those Lucias and Queens of the Night.  I doubt she regularly pulls out the high-F anymore, but Sumi Jo's depiction of Adalgisa, which sits in the middle of the voice, is certainly well sung.  Age has mellowed out a voice that I had previously thought overly bright, and, while not sacrificing her technical scrupulousness, Jo has become more of a vocal actress than I'd seen before.  Despite being older than Bartoli, Jo sounds quite young, and, to quote The Guardian, she portrays an \\"immensely touching depiction of ruined innocence.\\"  My one, fairly major, quibble with Jo is her questionable diction.  It's not the worst I've ever heard, but I've never been a fan of her Italian pronunciation.<br /><br />At long last, that leaves our Norma: Cecilia Bartoli.  Most reviews have leveled this recording simply because they dislike Bartoli.  Never mind that critical consensus seems mostly positive, as do the reviews on Amazon.co.uk, etc.  For some listeners, Bartoli is over-stepping and intruding on the hallowed ground of Callas.  It's not the potential ruin of Bellini's reputation that they're worried about.  Let's be honest and admit that the Callas widows are on patrol and will stop at nothing to sink the competition.  Callas was and will remain Norma; I will not argue with that.  She remains my go-to Druid Priestess, I have 5 recordings of her in the role, and I worship at the altar of La Divina, etc... but things must go on.  Sutherland was celebrated as Norma because of the heft of the voice, the flexibility, and the sheer beauty of sound.  Forget the dramatic context that Callas brought to the role because Sutherland didn't have it.  But, nonetheless, Callas and Sutherland defined the post-war interpretation: a high, agile voice, and hopefully a smack of theatrical talent here or there.  Basically, what that means, since both are dead and gone, we consider \\"Norma\\" a success if the soprano can pop off a D-sharp in opening cabaletta and the trio ending Act I.  We want a large orchestra like Tullio Serafin preferred, and we want a huge dramatic coloratura like the ones of yore (who don't seem to actually exist anymore).  Since we don't get either of these things, we're going to write off Bartoli's performance.<br /><br />Let me be clear: I don't think that Bartoli is a perfect Norma, but there are a lot more positives than negatives to be found in this recording.  Primarily, Bartoli is committed to giving a tour de force performance.  The text doesn't have the same meaning that Callas brought to it, but we have some splendid Italian diction (not the Slavic Norma we seem to be otherwise used to these days).  Bartoli's cavatina \\"Casta Diva\\" is gorgeously sung.  It is a hushed, prayer-like study in legato singing.  One of the benefits of having the smaller orchestra is having Casta Diva sung pianissimo.  With a large orchestra, the aria can lag and sag given that most sopranos don't have the theatrical flair to keep the text relevant, but Bartoli keeps us engaged, and even the decorations in the latter half of the aria are appropriate.  The duets with Jo are simply stunning, and there is a real sense of renewed joy in \\"Mira o Norma\\" and the following \\"Si, fino all'ore estreme.\\"  Bartoli is on her best behavior for most of the recording, and she only breaks out into the machine gun coloratura once or twice (notably in the \\"In mia man\\" duet).  There are no high D's to be found, and it brings an earthy quality often missing from contemporary Normas, and even the high C's are not lingered over in a conspicuous way.  Every high note is in service of the music, and there is no show-boating (from any of the principals).  The scene when Norma goes to her death is heartbreaking, and this is really where Bartoli succeeds.  She is soft and womanly, more accessible than other Normas who seek to rely on the character's dignity and cold aloofness.  That being said, Bartoli does have a small voice more suited to baroque music, and I did miss having a larger voice here or there (especially during the call to war).<br /><br />The usual cuts to the score have been opened, and some of the new music is a revelation.  As Norma sails quietly over the end of the \\"Guerra\\" chorus, one seems to hold one's breath.  The repeated verses allow for ornamentation in a recording that eschews interpolated high notes, and provides a bit of extra excitement.  Sadly, some questionable engineering mars the recording, thus making one quite aware of the recording process.  The reverb irritates now and again, especially if listening on headphones.  Additionally, Bartoli, Osborn, and Jo all seemed to be miked from different distances, and I felt Jo was drowned out of the trio in some parts.  This engineering is the biggest caveat that I would come up with about this recording, but it is far superior to the scratchy-mono recordings of Callas or the recordings with Sutherland and Caball&eacute; where there's continual tape hiss and loudly turned pages of music.<br /><br />When weighed in the balance, this recording is an extremely interesting experiment.  We have not fully investigated the revamping of early bel-canto in the same way that we have baroque music, but I hope that more artists begin to explore the possibility.  Ultimately, it will not displace Callas.  Not for me, and not for most others.  But it does open a fascinating window into what artists can do when accepted performance practices are re-examined and a fresh ear is applied to an old favorite.recordings are marred: the first by the Sutherland's and Caballé's; age and diminished vocal health, and the second by the ungainly heft/lack of flexibility apparent in both Eaglen's voice and Muti's conducting.  I was most surprised by the casting of Sumi Jo as Adalgisa.  I have nothing against Jo, per se, but I hadn't heard much from or about her in ages.  Would there be enough of a voice left for her to sing Adalgisa - especially after all those Lucias and Queens of the Night.  I doubt she regularly pulls out the high-F anymore, but Sumi Jo's depiction of Adalgisa, which sits in the middle of the voice, is certainly well sung.  Age has mellowed out a voice that I had previously thought overly bright, and, while not sacrificing her technical scrupulousness, Jo has become more of a vocal actress than I'd seen before.  Despite being older than Bartoli, Jo sounds quite young, and, to quote The Guardian, she portrays an \\"immensely touching depiction of ruined innocence.\\"  My one, fairly major, quibble with Jo is her questionable diction.  It's not the worst I've ever heard, but I've never been a fan of her Italian pronunciation.<br /><br />At long last, that leaves our Norma: Cecilia Bartoli.  Most reviews have leveled this recording simply because they dislike Bartoli.  Never mind that critical consensus seems mostly positive, as do the reviews on Amazon.co.uk, etc.  For some listeners, Bartoli is over-stepping and intruding on the hallowed ground of Callas.  It's not the potential ruin of Bellini's reputation that they're worried about.  Let's be honest and admit that the Callas widows are on patrol and will stop at nothing to sink the competition.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|All of the movies I have ordered in the past couple of years are sent directly from Amazon to my grandson in Ohio  who is terminally ill.  The movies are his choices and he is happy with them.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Not one of Connelly's best efforts. It had a lot of plot potential, but it just fizzles out at the end. Just the same, it probably is interesting enough to warrant spending some time reading it.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Yes, it has teenage-like drama and angst, but it's also full of wonder and heart.  It's a great movie for sci-fi lovers, but most boys will probably find it to mushy. I personally thought there was excessive kissing, but the two male leads are admittedly very attractive. William Hurt does a great job as the crazy survivalist uncle and I agree with the other reviewer who noted how well the main actress portrays two characters inhabiting one body. The story has some nice  philosophical threads and the soundtrack is amazing.  I'm writing this review because I read some of the bad ones and I would hate for people to miss out on a great alien/action/adventure/love story. They happen to be my favorite kind of movies.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|this video has no meanings, just a few interesting scenes and the rest is boarding talks... waste of time and ugly stuff as well
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What an emotional season. Not sure what I'll do with myself while awaiting the next season . I've read that the PBS version leaves something to be desired, thank you for having UK available.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really excited about this book but I'm having trouble getting through it.  I loved Bared to You and Reflected in you so I'm pretty disappointed with this one.  I can't seem to get into the characters she's making a big deal about now.  Not what I expected at all.  I won't be wasting my money on the next book!

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I found Tina Fey's storytelling of her life experiences to be strange, quirky and funny.  Riddled with delicious sarcasm that has become her signature style, this book still manages to give the reader a rare glimpse of her personal awkward and funny formative years as well as the behind the scenes politics of running not one but two (!) successful sketch comedy shows.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Tina Fey, of course, but also to those who grew up strange and awkward with big dreams.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this series, I hope there is more to come.  These books were page tuners, perfect amount of romance, suspense, and drama.

You won't believe some of the things the author can make in so many different skins and ages!<br /><br />There are also some makeup for men, so if you work with theater or cinema this book will completely fit your needs.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Overall the book was exactly what I expected Ms. Harris to write. It would have been nice if she wrote an epilogue instead of a whole book summing up theloose ends.
0316286850|5.0|This is the best makeup book ever released. I would recommend it for the people who already have minimal makeup skill and are willing to go to a more professional level.<br /><br />LOTS of information on brushes, products and skin types.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I felt I kept waiting for something big to happen- and it never did.  Mysteries from previous books were neatly and uneventfully explained; and then at the end of the book, we were told it was not the end.  No build-up or cliffhanger to grab us and make us want to read the next book. Utterly disappointed.

B00CXL6XP0|3.0|Much like their prog metal contemporaries Dream Theater, they opted to replace an iconic bandmate with a solid musician who first and foremost can reproduce their classic material. All other considerations seem secondary. If Geoff was going to get let go, part of me would want to see what the remaining guys might have achieved with a completely different breed of vocalist. Obviously that didn't happen, but I cannot fault QR for the decision they made. There are many livelihoods at stake, and if you can't reproduce the material fans will want to hear you risk a great deal.<br /><br />About this album... there are a lot of 5 star insta-posts here. This album is a good, but 5 stars this is not. By saying that you are saying that this is equal to the masterpiece efforts of Rage for Order and Mindcrime. This album simply isn't in that class. It is still a quality release and one I encourage other jaded Queenryche fans like myself to give an honest listen to. I rate it 4 maybe, but more like 3.5. There is potential here for a 4, but flawed because it was rushed out. Not nearly as rushed as Tate's QR effort, but rushed never-the-less. It is too bad that the current situation has forced this album out too early. More iteration on a few of the weaker tracks and some additional care with mixing on most of them might have let this album take a place amongst the band's finest efforts. Yet it appears there will be a lot of positive hype initially for QR 2013. I'd like to remind everyone this has been true for many recent releases, particularly MC 2. Don't believe me? Go read the user reviews. This isn't the first album recently released to be inundated by \\"this is the best album since Empire\\" posts all over Amazon.<br /><br />Obviously the last twenty years have seen what most fans consider lesser releases. Yet I have found gems in those albums that are still part of my regular playlists. Problem with those releases is those gems clearly got surrounded by a lot of uninspired filler tracks. Long-time fans like me started to get pretty jaded from all of that seemingly non-QR music in our new QR album. I would describe QR 2013 as a distillation of the post-DeGarmo era into a short but solid offering heard through slightly different playback settings. That's a good thing and it has me feeling optimistic about future albums that hopefully will get more time to fully mature before release.<br /><br />Final topic if you're still with me... we fans need to grow up. This back and forth fan flaming needs to stop. We are better than this. QR has always been the thinking man's metal and lately it feels we don't have single brain among us. I want to put a \\"'Ryche Fan\\" bag over my head. The shenanigans of the two Queensryches is bad, but the fan reactions have been more embarrassing. Seriously let's all step back and let these guys sort their mess out without all the fan-on-fan crime. None of us can relate to the situation these guys have been through. I can't agree with how Geoff has behaved recently, but I won't remotely claim to relate to his situation. I've been in relationships that ended after ~5 years and that was rough. A lot strong emotions come out and you do and say things that you later regret. These guys were together DECADES. Now throw in the additional pressure of falling from stadium rock gods to a marginal act whose recent efforts have seen poor sales and vicious reviews. I'm pretty sure I'd crack too. Let's get back to being the respectable fan base I used to be proud to be part of. See you at the next QR show.

1592407889|1.0|I'm about half way thru this book.  It's an easy read.  Many years ago, I saw Shirley in concert in London, she was awesome!.  I've always loved \\"Sweet Charity\\"-it's a very underated film and I think arguably contains the best female performance in any musical. So I got the book because of Ms Parker's relationship to a performer that I enjoy.<br /> Some of the stories/\\"memories\\" seem too outlandish to be convincing- we know that Shirley is a little \\"curious' in her spiritual beliefs.  But I find it next to impossible to believe that she thought her \\"husband \\" was actually in space working for the Government and that the guy living in japan purporting to be her husband was a \\"clone\\".  I believe the marriage was odd and that he embezzled her money, but the story Sachi presents- I don't think so.  Also Sachi seems prtty sluttish in her life.  By her own admission she was willing to swap sex for a Boob job. And her other -somewhat over detailed sexual stories could have left out some of the detail- And do we realaly need to read about her wondering about semen on a sheet to the point of smelling it?<br /><br />I am sure Shirley and her daughter have little communication now, let's face the fact without Shirley being her mom would we be reading this book?  She owes more to her mom than she realizes.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading &#34;Reflected in You,&#34; I immediately pre-ordered book 3 from Amazon and it was automatically delivered to my Kindle on the publication date. However, my anticipation turned to apprehension when I read another customer's review expressing her disappointment in &#34;Entwined with You,&#34; lambasting the author for turning a trilogy into a 5-book series and viciously complaining about some of Eva's actions. I almost didn't want to read it, for fear that it would spoil my pleasure of the first two.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. &#34;Entwined&#34; is every bit as satisfying as &#34;Bared&#34; and &#34;Reflected.&#34; If you liked Gideon and Eva in the first two books, you'll like them in the third. Does Eva make some questionable decisions at times? Of course, she's 24. She's trying to be mature, trying not to be a bitch to people who are being nice to her or doing things out of love for her, but she finds herself in a complex emotional landscape and her experience with personal relationships is limited and, in most instances, warped by her history of abuse. At no time does her love for Gideon waver, which would be the cardinal sin in this series. The reader who wrote such a scathing review is clearly in love with Gideon (it happens and he is, after all, Superman), and no other woman – especially one that makes different choices than this reader feels she would have in the same situation – is good enough for him. We understand, we sympathize, but allowing such personal feelings to creep into a product review does a disservice to other interested potential readers.<br /><br />As for the charge that Sylvia Day is turning an expected trilogy into a series to make a quick buck, that seems a bit unfair. We as readers obviously don't know what is in the mind of the author when she makes these decisions, but it seems reasonable to give her the benefit of the doubt. When writing the first book, she envisioned a trilogy, with probably a rough idea of the major plot points she would cover in each novel. No doubt her publishers, looking for the next &#34;50 Shades&#34; phenomenon, were eager to publicize the trilogy format. However, when writing, a story sometimes takes on a life of its own. The characters develop in ways you didn't expect, but are perfectly in keeping with the psyches you've created. Conclusions that felt natural and inevitable in the abstract seem rushed as you start stringing together the scenes that lead the reader there. You discover loose ends that you realize you must tie up to be fair to both your characters and your readers (e.g. the police probably wouldn't conveniently drop a murder investigation of such prominent people after a week or two of poking around). So yes, Day probably envisaged a trilogy when she started writing &#34;Bared&#34;, but as the story progressed, she likely realized that it was bigger than she'd first thought. Personally, I'm pleased that she didn't rush to finish it in a third book just because the early press for the series called this the last book.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Eva continually calls Gideon &#34;ace&#34; – it seems unnatural for a woman of her age in this age and jolts me out the story every time she does it. It strikes a similarly dissonant chord as Aidan's &#34;Hot Stuff&#34; endearment for Lyssa in Day's previous Dream Guardians series.<br /><br />Other than that small detail, &#34;Entwined&#34; was a good read, and I, for one, will have no problem pre-ordering the fourth installment when it finally becomes available.the major plot points she would cover in each novel.

I have read Colleen's other books Slammed and Point of Retreat so knowing what she is capable of in delivering a story I was really excited for this read.  She didn't disappoint!  The story in itself was simply fantastic and the delivery was spot on!<br /><br />Sky is your typical 17 year old, OK so really she isn't typical at all.  She lives with her adopted Mother and leads a fairly sheltered life.  No electronics and I mean NONE no cell phone, no television, no Internet and she is home schooled.  Now from the very beginning of the book I kept saying why?  In this day and age how does one live without their iPhone, iPad, Internet and every other modern convenience?<br /><br />Sky is luck to at least have a neighbor and best friend in Six.  Yes I said Six but her name is really Seven?  And no this isn't that strange TV show Blossom from the 80's...  Six moved next store to Sky and they became instant best friends.  Unfortunately after convincing her mother Karen to allow her to attend public school her senior year she finds out that Six has been accepted to study abroad and she will be entering her senior year alone.<br /><br />Sky isn't really shy but she doesn't interact well with guys, most of the guys that she knows is through her neighbor who is deemed the school slut, which unfortunately makes Sky her accomplice in such behavior.  Sky is everything but a slut actually.  She really doesn't have any interest in guys and whenever she does become \\"friendly\\" with them she tends to zone out into her own little world feeling numb.  That is until she meets Dean Holder at the local grocery store.  From the moment she sees him in the check out line she is completely drawn to him and isn't sure why.  They have a brief and all be it odd conversation in the parking lot where he mistakes her for someone he thinks he knows.  What Sky doesn't know is that Holder is also completely drawn to her but can't explain why.  Sky's instant attraction is foreign to her because she has NEVER felt this way about a guy before... EVER!<br /><br />Sky is warned off of Holder with her best friend painting him as the perpetual bad boy!  As Sky starts school she realizes quickly what a mistake it was.  Sky quickly learns that the legacy that Six left behind seems to have rubbed off on her in the worst way but being the type of girl that she is she shrugs it off and simply doesn't give into the high school drama.  She knows who she is and so does her new best friend in the whole world Breckin.  Breckin and Sky form an instant bond since they are both new at the school.  With Six gone she is happy to find at least one person in this school that she is willing to be friends with.<br /><br />Sky is really surprised when Holder enrolls back into the school that she is attending and seems to be in her face everywhere she turns.  What she comes to find is that umors are just that rumors. Holder is up front with her about his past when she finally asks the questions about what happened to him the previous year.  Holder is very open and honest with his feelings and he is a very deep person.  He holds a lot of hurt and anguish over things that have happend in his past.<br /><br /> Sky and Holder seem to find a common ground and become fast friends which leads to more... When she shows up in a bracelet that sparks anger in Holder, he refuses to explain and it sets off somewhat of a chain reaction.<br /><br />As Sky starts having dreams that she just can't explain.  She feels that they aren't real but deep down knows that they are in some way.  Her story quickly starts to unravel when Holder mistakenly calls her by the wrong name on night while drunk and falling asleep in her bed.  This sends her into a flurry of emotions and brings about information that she doesn't know if she wants but knows that she needs...  Holder holds the keys to her past and her world quickly changes and she struggles with the information she is being dealt.  It unravels so fast it made my head spin like the girl in The Exorcist!<br /><br />The end of the book is simply just non-stop twists and turns that had me wondering what could possibly happen next.  I was captivated by this story and simply could not put it down.<br /><br />Colleen's characters are simply lovable and irresistible! I don't know how she came up with this story but it was a delight and will be one I will want to read again someday!  I don't have too many of those books I would read again but this is will surely make that list!<br /><br />I give HOPELESS 5 STARS it was really THAT GOOD!!!!!<br /><br />This book does deal with abuse so if that is something that truly bothers you maybe this isn't the book for you but it is dealt with in a delicate manner.les with the information she is being dealt.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoy the series, but it needs to end...I was really disappointed that the series was not wrapped up with this one. It is just a repeat of the storyline in the first 2 novels.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This game was very boring for me. As the name implies you are in a room. One room, the only room, a dark room with a puzzle box.  This game did not keep my attention and became frustrating at one point because the functionality was so poor.  This game is NOT worth the 1.99 I paid for it. It did download to my kindle fire HD but there were many hiccups while playing.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released, and I was so enthralled with it. It is just as majestic today as it was in the theater many years ago. When I watch it -  I am still just as in love with the music, singers, dancers, costumes, location, editing, actors.  The only thing that now wears on me (after watching it many so many times) is Tom Hulce's laugh...but  Milos Forman's explanation makes it more bearable. Elizabeth Berridge's performance as Mozart's wife seems disconcerting, because her cadence seems too contemporary and too American.  Watching Salieri waiver, suffer and then succumb to his envy did actually frighten me. F. Murray Abraham's scene at the end lightened things up.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this series. I'm very picky when it comes to watching fantasy movies but this series has me captivated, excited, and speechless. I have read all five books written by the author and was happy that I did. It was worth the investment and watching the series on HBO was also worth it. I liked it so much I decided to purchase the dvd's for my video library collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this, it is a wonderful thing to do in your down time, and love the graphics when you win a game
B0072OFM28|5.0|I enjoyed this series of Spartacus. Great storyline, great actors, and full of suspense. I am going to hate to see the series come to a close. I purchased the dvd's to add to my video collections. It is so worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome. they made some pretty remarkable adjustments from other horse games. Incantation never take my eyes off of my horse.
0525478817|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for a long time.  It was an absolutely wonderful read.  It was at turns hilarious and heartfelt; I laughed a number of times and cried a few as well.<br /><br />Hazel is sixteen and on a drug that is holding her cancer at bay, but just barely.  Her lungs don't work and she needs oxygen to breath, but she is going to school and taking it one day at a time.  That is until Augustus Waters limps into Cancer Kid Support Group with his 80% survival rate and a wicked wink.  Hazel doesn't want to get involved but she just can't help herself.<br /><br />Yes this book is about teen kids with cancer, but it is surprisingly hilarious despite it's somewhat somber topic.  Hazel has a snarky and hilariously dark sense of humor.  She sees dark humor in everything from the Cancer Group's continually rotating attendance (because you know a lot of the kids die off) to the sad fact that their councilor's best accomplishment of his rather boring life is having survived testicular cancer.<br /><br />Somehow rather than pitying Hazel  you empathize with her and laugh along with her as she struggles to make a life with this crazy hand she's been dealt.  Green does an excellent job of covering a number of issues for this kind of situation.  Hazel is very smart and emotionally mature.  One of the things she is most concerned about is being a burden on those she loves. At one point she says something to the effect of \\"After all, the only thing worse than being a kid with cancer is being the parent of a kid with cancer.\\"<br /><br />Watching Hazel interact with her parents is really interesting too.  She's an only child.  Her dad is excessively emotional and breaks into tears at the slightest emotional tumult (good or bad).  Her mother basically has a full time job managing Hazel's doctor appointments and care.  Her parents love her and try hard not to hover and this is portrayed really well in this book.  Hazel never gets really rebellious, but her and her mother do get into some very typical mom/teen arguments.<br /><br />The other characters in this book are just as interesting and engaging as Hazel.  Augustus of course is in the story a ton; he is a happy-go-lucky type of guy who is absolutely drawn to Hazel right from the get go.  He draws her out of her comfort zone to a place where she gets to experience something she never would.<br /><br />Isaac is another major character in this book.  He is struggling with eye cancer and is getting ready to undergo a surgery that will require the removal of his other eye...making him blind.  Watching him cope with this along with all your other typical teenage problems was interesting; he was a very engaging character as well.<br /><br />It was awesome both how extraordinary and ordinary these kids are.  They are all just making their way through life and trying to deal with all the stuff we are all trying to deal with day to day, with some extra junk thrown in.<br /><br />I won't talk a lot about the plot except to say it builds up to Hazel getting to fullfill one of her lifelong dreams.  There are many twists and turns along the way.  The ending is hopeful, realistic, and heartbreaking all at once.  This story is incredibly engaging, well written, and hard to put down.  I stayed up super late to finish this book.<br /><br />Overall an amazing and excellent book that manages to be hilarious and heartfelt all at the same time.  It puts the reader through such an emotional roller-coaster; you will laugh out loud a ton...you will cry some too.  I really really enjoyed it.  It takes a wonderful author to write such a fabulous book that deals with such a tough topic and yet makes it hilarious, absolutely heartfelt, and engaging.  Strongly recommended for everyone to read!mother do get into some very typical mom/teen arguments.<br /><br />The other characters in this book are just as interesting and engaging as Hazel.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great read with a very chilling ending. Highly recommended!! I couldn't put the book down which is rare for me.
0062255657|5.0|I was dying to read this book.  So I bought it the day it came out and instantly sat down and read it.  It was a spectacular read with a dark fairy tale vibe to it and a very nostalgic atmosphere.<br /><br />The book starts with our nameless main character who is a middle aged man who has journeyed back to his childhood town for a funeral.  Once there he journeys to the Hempstock farm and starts to remember strange things about his childhood that he has long forgotten.  Thus starts the tale of a seven year boy and a magical girl named Lettie Hempstock who believes the duck pond behind her house is an ocean.<br /><br />Spectacular read with a dark fairy tale/folklorish vibe to it.  I enjoyed it a lot.  This book is very atmospheric, full of subtle magic, and a bit creepy.<br /><br />As normal Gaiman does an excellent job with imagery and really makes the world and time come alive for his readers.  The majority of the book is told from a child's perspective and as such the story has a very childlike quality to it.  The narrator doesn't see things like an adult would and tends to simplify certain problems while still being able to accept a world beyond his imagination.<br /><br />We are introduced to a world that is both nostalgic and eerily magical.  There are monsters that dwell here and monsters that prey on those monsters.  There are strangely sympathetic cats, little girls that are old, and ponds that are really oceans.  It is a magical place that lies within and near our world.  It is also a dark and scary place but not without it's light.<br /><br />The book mainly emphasis the power and importance of story and the quest of one adult to follow his nostalgia and unravel the mysteries that surround it.<br /><br />This book would probably be appropriate for young adults, but not for younger readers.  The monsters are way to creepy for younger readers, they were enough to give me nightmares.  As well there is a scene where the narrator's father is intimately involved with another woman (which the narrator as a child doesn't understand).  There was also a scene where the narrator digs a gigantic worm out of his foot that really grossed me out...<br /><br />The story wraps up in a way that is full of irony and will make you chuckle a bit as a reader.  It is also a bit sad and melancholy.  It's the type of story you think back to and wonder at.  Definitely something I will read again at some point.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a spectacular read.  I loved the dark fairy tale feel to it, the way childhood wonder and nostalgia are portrayed, and the absolutely terrifying monsters that the narrator encounters.  Gaiman has a created a story full of the wonder of childhood, the terror of things that bump in the night, and the magicallness of it all.  This is a wondrous story that I recommend everyone read.d with another woman (which the narrator as a child doesn't understand).

B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this rating because it is the second book in an awesome series and many of the events are completely unexpected. I really have no complaints about the book and it is definitely among my favorites. It is very descriptive at times especially during injuries so if you can't handle that I would not recommend reading this book. Other than that I'd recommend this book to teens and older because younger kids may not be able to handle the content because of the intensity of the events.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Jimmy B youre the best. Few if any Bond films disappoint. Kinda glad to see M move on . Great action scenes
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I expected this book to be the third and final book of this series. Instead I found it boring and could have been left out altogether. I have totally lost interest in reading anymore of Sylvia Day books. Moving on.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was skeptical about the first one but now I'm so hooked n into them I can't wait for the fourth installment!!!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|For me, this is the perfect case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  I didn't want a case that was designed to stay on the Fire as I was using it (I like the way the Fire feels in my hand without a case).  I just wanted a case that would protect it when I wasn't using it.  If you're looking for a case that doubles as a stand, look elsewhere.  This one completely encloses the Fire like a form-fitting pouch.  It's made of material similar to a diver's wetsuit (neoprene?), and it fits the Fire like a glove.  It's padded enough to protect it from knocks and drops.  It has a double zipper, which allows you to hook up the Fire for charging while it's in the case.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed the game. there were not enough levels but still fun. the levels were a chalange and kept me looking for a while.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Like all the choices and that you can choose length of time on sleep function. Love how it fades the volume out during the last minute of your chosen sleep timer.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|In his latest Sigma adventure, James Rollins takes the reader to some unexpected places. And as always, I was riveted for the ride.<br /><br />Atilla the Hun's death begins the adventure, his murder shown through his new wife's eyes. But she isn't acting alone, and soon we're catapulted on an adventure that takes the reader to Macau, Mongolia, literally around the world.<br /><br />A mysterious comet streaks across the sky, captivating the world, but leading to some scientific curiosity, which quickly turns to concern. A satellite crashes, but before it does, it gives scientists (including the head of Sigma, Painter Crowe) a terrifying glimpse into what could occur in the near future. The Earth may be in ruins in a few scant days, unless Sigma and friends can save the day.<br /><br />The stakes have never been higher!<br /><br />Seichan is wrestling with information about her heritage, but when Sigma needs her, she steps up, working closely with Sigma to help find a relic whose origins just may be out of this world.<br /><br />Literally!<br /><br />Old friends are back--Monk, Kat, Rachel, and Vigor, and new characters Duncan and Jada are immediately captivating.<br /><br />Dark energy and quantum physics blend with history, adventure, and some truly touching stories about the human condition to make this more than a beach read. Mulling over the concepts of this book will take a while. It is a deeply layered story and incredibly thought provoking.<br /><br />While I loved the new characters, I was saddened that Lisa was only mentioned in passing. Given that she and Kat were such an integral part of Bloodline, Mr. Rollins' last Sigma adventure, I'd hoped for some \\"screen time\\" for her.<br /><br />The Seichan versus Rachel dilemma for Gray came to a very natural conclusion. I love the way Mr. Rollins showed all three characters having grown from their romantic bonds together. These books are not romances, and just the right amount of romantic interaction is shown.<br /><br />Mr. Rollins has a talent for writing female characters, and Seichan and Rachel really shine here. They're going through very different journeys with family ties and responsibilities, and  it was fascinating to see these unfold.<br /><br />Another solid winner here. Mr. Rollins never disappoints!
0399255370|5.0|This book is hilarious. Very entertaining.  It is a great book for any age group... Us librarians recommend buying this book for your collection.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|This was written with an interesting view of WWII Germany from a child's  perspective.  A good read and good for book group discussion.j
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was hard to get started, but once I got interested in the story line,it was so interesting that I had a problem putting it down.  Thanks Colleen.  GREAT BOOK!!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This movie was a musical favorite for me with Cher and Christina Aquilera showing there talents like crazy, so I loved finally getting this soundtrack....I love every song!!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I really wish you could add your own pictures.<br />My kids love playing this game and I find it pretty fun too!
B00479SVBU|3.0|I've read the reviews about how great this product is and I'm wondering if I'm using it correctly.  It works....sometimes.  Mostly it's just static.  Sometimes in the wee hours of the morning I can get a clear sound, but not for very long.  Once I start driving around my major metropolitan city, it's just static.  I've tried all the frequencies from high to low.  Works best at the lower frequencies but still not great.  Definitely not the experience I was hoping for.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This ap is really great!<br />I also enjoy the lyrics feature.<br />Verry highly recommend this to all my co-workers and friends.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I don't have the movie yet, but I have seen it before and it is a slice of my childhood, I love it. :)

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The book is not finished.  I hate when writers to that.  She should have finished the book and then did a 4th. Also, no really story in this one, doesn't make me want to read the next book if there will be one. Very disappointed.  My reading stops here with this series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game isnt to bad I think its okay its not really worth my time but for any one who likes to play role play games and being a weaker then this is the game for you
B003R50FRI|4.0|A long meandering yarn of a complex and hidden world. Written with a clever mix of wit and suspense, and enlightenment.
B00364K6YW|5.0|colin firth, who doesn't love this actor. the movie itself is a classic.if you don't have this in your library.I'm sorry. from beginning to the end.I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Very fun but a lot of villainy token cost, it could be more reasonable, with company's trying to make money off of every little thing you do...just saying
0894803123|5.0|I have enjoyed reading how Ben & Jerry came to be great ice cream makers.  The recipes are good too:-)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|pretty fun to play. easy to learn and easy to play. I love it and it is an excellent time killer
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|A great book like Rachels Holiday. I am definitely reading the rest of he Walsh family series! Not to be missed!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have only been playing a short time, but this game is pretty fun. Graphics are great and can be challenging driving.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|No spoilers, but after finishing this novel, I can honestly say that as much as I love Sylvia Day and her characters, the promise for another novel featuring Eva and Gideon feels forced. I think better editing and approximately 80 more pages could have concluded this steamy and compelling read in this third installment. I wasn't totally on-board with some of the plot twists in this third Crossfire Series, so even though I finished reading this book within 3 days, I did wish for tighter editing in some spots. If you're rooting for a happy ending for Eva and Gideon as I am, this novel is not to be missed.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book was well researched and opens the door to a different lifestyle of not so long ago.  An enjoyable read and inspiring.  Well worth your time.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This book should be high on the reading list for all managers. It helped me to understand the flaws in my thinking.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always; very good, hard to put down.<br />Excellent story, not finished it yet, but I am sure I will not be disappointed!
B0007PLLQ0|4.0|I like this movie, even though it's rather strange.. some beautiful images, especially the scene with the unicorns.. some bizarre scenes.  it is what it is..
B009NY43NY|2.0|I am still trying to figure out how what I feel about this book...somewhat confused, sad, disappointed.  I expected much more for the last book in the series.  I am not going to spoil anything for anyone. I read some horrible reviews prior to my purchase and still had to buy it to see for myself.  I feel it was rushed and the things that were wrapped up were not wrapped up to my satisfaction.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I don't do anything heavy on my machine. Just World of Tanks and some Rift once in a while. CPU is over-clockable. I haven't done it. Don't need to. Cooling is adequate, fan is nearly silent at speed under load. Recommended for a budget machine. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />(update) Still going strong, still happy. I have ordered a larger cooler for it. Temps spike sometimes. Got a Cooler Master T3 on order from Amazon.<br /><br />Installed the T3X. Easy installation even if a bit tight. Temps dropped a full 10C. Love the chip and the T3X![[ASIN:B0028Y4S9K Cooler Master Hyper TX3 - CPU Cooler with 3 Direct Contact Heat Pipes (RR-910-HTX3-G1)]]
1611761069|3.0|The plot was great as usual, but the reader left a lot to be desired.  I would pass on any Audio books read by her,
0374533555|4.0|Amazing book. Very strong in identifying biases, errors, judgement illusions, and wrongful human tendencies in thinking. I recommend that everyone reads it, and strongly for those in decision making positions in their careers.<br /><br />One flaw of the book, it needs to introduce more about its pre-requisites. Some chapters are unclear for the ordinary reader unless he/she would know the theories and/or the topics the author is affirming or contradicting. It required some minor research from my side while reading it to be able to understand some chapters and sub-chapters. Beneficial, yet nonetheless I guess it can be mentioned beforehand so that the reader would be prepared.<br /><br />Also, its quite dense, so it needs quite some focus and good follow up from the reader. It is a book that needs revisiting after you have read it once.<br /><br />Conclusion: every household needs a copy in this age of illusion and erroneous decision making.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|TWO WORDS...GREAT READ! This book is a true feast of literary greatness...looking forward to the next books! Much better than JOB!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It's always annoyed me that my Kindle Fire did not have a calculator that I liked.  I've tried several different ones.  But, I found that I really liked the simple one on my iphone and ipod.  I was happy to see this one come up recently and decided to give it a try.  I was even happier when I realized its basically the same as the calculators that I use regularly and love.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|My daughter loves the doll, she plays with it every day :-) She is really into Monster High dolls and I am glad that I found this doll at a reasonable price.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I would love to give these a 5 star, and would have up to a week ago.  I got these in January 2013, and loved them.  They sounded good, felt good on my head, and kept a charge for up to 8 hours of me talking on vent and playing Wow.  But starting about a week ago I started getting static in the headset, and from what I can tell the mic seems to have a short in it.  At first I could move the mic and the static would stop, but that only worked for a few days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is my addiction . Play it all the time. Don't  wont to put it down once i start to play .
B0013ND30W|5.0|my kids  loved it  they enjoy all the Disney movies. I would definitely  recommend this movie . arrived fast and in excellent condition
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|A little different but of course I expected it to be.  I was intrigued by Kaleb in all the other books and was happy to read his book but<br />this book left me thinking i'd missed a book.  I hadn't.  Oh well.  Still looking forward to the last two books in this series!!!<br />These Psy/Changdling books are beyond GOOD!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome and addictive. I like how they update it and put new cars and maps on the game
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Little conflict--No real solution--No ending. Author is dragging to force another book. Supporting character (Cary) is becoming more interesting than Gideon and &#34;Angel&#34;--not good.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The feature that is missing is the ability to turn this app off. As it is, it constantly monitors your e-mail and alerts you to a message delivery. I'd like it better if I could shut everything off as needed or wanted. Instead, I had to resort to deleting the app and just logging in via the browser.
B0095D4JUA|5.0|The quality of the video is superb.  I've been able to watch it on my kindle, as well as through the internet connection feature of my HDTV.
0739366416|5.0|I bought the audio CD when it came out, but for some reason waited until now to listen. Actually, after thoroguhly enjoying Justice Sotomayer's autobiography, I was inspired to listen to the President's especially since he appointed her. This book gives a lot of insight into of course Barack Obama, the man, husband and Senator,(he was not the president when it was written). It also sheds a lot of light on politics in America, so much so that I got a little intense for me and I had to stop listening for a day. Although, It was cool driving and have the president's voice in my car all that political talk made it hard to concentrate on driving. I found some of the book very amusing ( his first interaction with Bush) and other very touching,( his courtship of Michelle and his devotion to his daughters). I highly recommend this book to anyone that plans on voting or has voted in the past.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Since I haven't been able to get this program to work, it was a waste of time and money for me.  I'm not particularly computer savvy and I intend to have a friend, who works with computers to help me, but as far as I'm concerned, It's not user-friendly.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I love Eva, and I waited YEARS for this to hit American markets... The special features are decent, and the twists amazing. A must buy for Eva fans everywhere!
0425263916|5.0|If you've ever wanted a romantic/erotic novel, Sylvia Day doesn't disappoint. The love story between Gedion and Eva continues in this book, their bonds growing closer, you can't help but fall in love with this couple, their story and the details of their sorted pasts that bring them so close together.
B00AKKS278|4.0|Well... What can I say... The first part was a little too much of describing Hal's life's tries... but I think the system works!!!<br />Reading this book makes you say: hey! now is a good time to transform your life...<br />Obviously, I'm not doing it all perfect, but I think I'll get there...<br />And... I am excited about the journey! :)
0425263908|5.0|The story of Gedion and Eva begins, when two people meet and they instantly are attracted to each other, not knowing what the future may en tale, they cannot seem to forget the tension they have one another. With so many issues of sorted pasts for both of them, which ultimately brings them closer to one another.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I have not opened the case yet because I lost my kindle fire few days before the case arrived in the mail. I am just waiting to see if any one would turn it in. I lost it in the one of the hospitals in Rochester, NY. I think I will have to return the case soon as it appears that I am not able to get the device back.
B00C061HZY|3.0|The cd sounded way better than the vinyl.  The 3 stars is for the vinyl version not the music.  The music really good.
B0034G4P1W|4.0|Its a good,funny movie,me and the 3 village idiots ( dogs ) watch it now a couple times for movie night. I enjoy it very much,its fun and wholesome like wheat bread. Good for children to enjoy.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|What a fun and touching film -- just the thing for viewers of all ages. It avoids the silly/inane in favor of a good story that engages our imagination.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game and is super entertaining!! I have a ton of fun playing it! I definitely give this five stars
B008M4MB8K|5.0|It was great to finally get to see the original theatrical release of this classic again. I saw it in theaters when it first came out but when I got it years later, all they had was the director's cut. The director's cut was good but I missed the nostalgia of seeing it like I originally saw it. I haven't watched the final cut version yet but look forward to it.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|As the title says. Very disappointed. Bought it for the kids to make videos, on the Fire HD, but they are ridiculously out of sync. I'd recommend you try a different app.
034580404X|5.0|My books came in better condition than I thought they wood.  I haven't read anything that erotic in a long time.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This film is excellent and it was a gift for my daddy for fathers day and we enjoyed watching it! I would recommend to anyone who likes car chase movies.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Omg that was such a good book!! I had a feeling Gideon was the one who killed Nathan!! That is so sweet!! I cried I laughed and I just loved it!! I really need the next one!! :)
B00B6EJ28U|4.0|Very nice record, only skips on one song but who cares! Very satisfied with them and it arrived promptly and in acceptable condition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers its very fun and I play this every day also I think the new one that came out/Paris is the best one yet.
B00ABA1OP4|5.0|If you are a Rammstein fan you must have this item in you collection, best regards from Bolivia. Fur imer
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this series so much-it is my favorite show on television. Thanks Amazon for having  it available to watch!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|this game sukes on the 2 level the code for the breif case is 493 but it wount work and you have to have the thing in there to do any thing else I wasted a hour trying to fix it its a waste of youer time to even got this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun game! has just enough challenges with enough possibilities to engage you.<br />Have fine escaping  because I sure did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is pretty realistic and fun u can do a lot of things with ur horse but I wish the horses were cheaper that's my only complaint
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Decent quality, had most of the bits I needed to take apart my macbook air.  Did not have the bits needed to remove the trackpad or the keyboard (2011 macbook air).  Nicely packaged,  would give an additional star if all bits were included.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Great quality and quick delivery. This is an very tough watch with a lot of beautifull features. I think i will not experience a lot of problems with it. So much quality for a relative low price is remarkable.
B00AEBBAEU|5.0|I love this movie.  The sound alone takes you to another place in your mind.  Combine that with the excellent filmography and Daniel Day Lewis?  What more could you want.  As for the product itself,  its a blue ray, looks and sounds great.  Nothing fancy about the packaging but nevertheless a good price for a great product.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the fact that they got married towards the end - best surprise in the book - however to be perfectly honest this book has way too many common factors/similarities with &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; trilogy.  All characters are dysfunctional, abuse victims, etc.<br />If you've read both you'll know what I mean.  However I will say that the Eva in this series is a much better heroine than in Fifity Shades - she's not as weak as Anastasia!<br /><br />Looking forward to the next installment because I can't believe Sylvia ended the book that way - guess we have something to look foreward to tie up the loose ends!<br /><br />Thanks Sylvia for keeping us entertained!
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Like the review I left for &#34;Into Darkness&#34;, I don't have much to add here that others have not already said. I'm a Trekkie dating back to the original series and including every show and movie since (except &#34;Enterprise&#34;... I do not care for Scott Bakula, thank you very much!) But like I said, I'm a fan of Trek from way back, and I really liked this reboot. It got me excited about these films again for the first time in years (no small thing considering the monumental let-downs some of the previous films were). It is a great introduction to the new cast, and to the circumstances that put them in the state they are in as we are re-introduced. It is different, yes, but it is still Star Trek. As a Trekkie from way back, I highly recommend it! (Plus, it's pretty much essential viewing if you plan to see &#34;Into Darkness&#34; at some point... a lot won't make much sense if you haven't seen this one first.)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldnt wait to read the 3rd book on the crossfire novel.....it was sweet and exciting and left me wanting more books, so I am hoping this is not the end of their lovestory.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was a little better, but this is a great story and I've watched it three times so far
B00AXVIBKW|3.0|The CD is ok.  It sounds exactly like Bad Religion's other 14 CDs.  If you like them, you'll probably like this; though if you dont get this, you won't be missing much.
B008Y73940|5.0|I thought this was one of the best movies I  have ever seen. Keeps your attention. Two great stars in the movie. Matthew McConaughey  is very well suited for his role as the defendent's attorney.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I wanted to read these books since I started watching the TV show. The books are captivating! I can't wait to read book 2!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't get enough of this series!  Love it!  It gives me a great and exciting escape from everyday life.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What's not to love about Game of Thrones. Whether you have only seen the show, or haven't seen the show or read the books; this is till an excellent book.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Its a shame I spent money on another product similar to this and it broke within two months. How, I don't know. I so called was trying to save 10 bucks. I got what I paid for. Crap! However, this product from Apple works and continues to work great. I learned my lesson trying to go cheap. Won't do that again.
0525953728|3.0|This is book is entertaining, but you could spend 2.5 hours watching Zero Dark Thirty and pretty much get the same information that the book offers.  Sure, the book offers some background on the Seal training and selection program that the movie doesn't get into, but in my opinion the book \\"Seal Team Six\\" by Howard Wasdin provides a much more interesting account of the Seal training program.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book is the personality of the author as it is exhibited in this book. As much as you want to love the guy because of the sacrifice he made for the country and his role in this histoic mission, it is difficult.  The author cannot seem to comprehend that there could be other interests at stake besides the Seal's readiness to strike against a target.  He views the world in a very simple  good guy vs. bad guy way and that view is pervasive throughout the book.  His lack of perspective at times is shocking.  Somehow he is apparently angry that \\"Washington\\" (his terminology) talked publically about the raid thereby compromising the identity of the Seals, yet he is entitled to write a book on the subject!  He says at one point that after the raid he wants to \\"disappear in the shadows\\" and apparently he expected the rest of the country to do the same.  The author is apparently unable to understand that killing Bin Laden wasn't just the assassination of some random warlord, it was the key point (or was supposed to be at least) in a war that the country had invested trillions of dollars into and had been fighting for over a decade.  How can the author be surprised that this is something Washington would address publically with the American people?  His co-author did him a disservice here by not identifying the hypocrisy and making his rationalizations for writing the book sound so flimsy.<br /><br />To conclude, it's worth a read because this is an interesting topic but don't expect to walk away with a warm-fuzzy-patriotic feeling about the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think the game is perfect for kids but my three year old had a little trouble but my six year old loved it this app is the best for my kids thank u
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Brings back nostalgia for the days of the Crimson room and the other escape room games, it manages to pose a bit of a challenge without seeming too impossible.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys these kind of games
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the funnest app i have ever gotten. It is very addictive. So addictive that i cant put it into words.<br />There are some bugs but they always fix them in the updates.<br />You should get this, it is worth the money!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This prouably number one out of all of my favorite game that I have on my Kindle Fire keep up the good work Mojang.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|OK.
B0020BUWX2|1.0|When I read the summary, it sounded really good and intense. But I was in the middle of the book and I still had no idea about the characters. They were boring, flat and typical. I  really didn't care as about them at all.  I excepted to bawl outright when Mia' s family died, but I'm sad to say that I didn't shed one single tear. This book was not properly written, the topic and ending typical. Also, I really didn't appreciate how the .author was using so much curse words. I understand you need them to emphasize your point, but throughout the book, it proved it useless and a bit annoying. The way their parents didn't care about Mia- saying curse words in front of her; is a bad example.
B00008DDSC|4.0|I saw this movie when I was in high school and loved it ever since. I like the personality of the main characters in this film. I mostly like this film because of the concept. James Spader is one of my favorite actors, but it seems a bit cliche they always put him in movies like this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is better than howrse, if you have never been on or heard of it look it up.howrse is a website not an APP. Howrse is great my horse is awesome
B0085A9J18|3.0|This movie is my first and only favorite indonesian kung fu film. I like this movie because of the concept and the fighting is not traditional hand to hand; its brutal. I don't own too many martial arts movies, but this one I had to get.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Wow.  Totally engrossing, confusing at times, but an incredible novel about the humanity within us all, and the in humane actions of evil.  I hope this book is made into a movie.
B0058ZPNOK|4.0|The humor is vulgar which is my taste anyway. I wouldn't advice this to just anyone, unless they like Beavis and Butthead or Southpark. The character Hesher makes very stupid and dumb comment and sometimes at the wrong time which makes his character hilarious. I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt more because he has the ability to play such a character. &#34;Have you heard of the granny-killer?&#34; LOL!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging enough to be fun, but not too hard. Fun for my 6 year old daughter too. We had fun playing it together.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|This is another set of my favorite Disney movies I really enjoyed it and I think anybody else would appreciate this to also got this is a good price
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Top 5 show on television. Nonstop action in this season of Suits. Harvey Specter for president! Can't wait for Season 3
B003IKMR0U|5.0|My wife bought this one of regaining parties all the kids seemed about this give it a try It's good for
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its like you have a real horse. Its very creative and interesting. It has decent graphics i was very surprised. It is very addictive and entertaining
B003O86FMW|5.0|This only took 3days. Can't wait to get started on the 3rd book later tonight. I love using the library.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|i just wish the chapters were longer and more chapter like the last to books. there was so many questions not  answered
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The last two levels are the hardest. I just can't wait for more levels. I love puzzle games but some are just to difficult. Before I go on this game works great on my kindle. When I started playing it I knew that there were only 10 levels and I had to force myself to stop at 7. I not only wanted the experience to last but I also needed to do some housework. Another great thing it is a totally free game. Some games try to get you hooked and then to play on you need to purchase something. I will be anxiously waiting for more levels.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like it Because it shows my video downloads in very high quality. But It is pretty much takes up too much space in my internal storage.
B0094KORXI|5.0|one of my personal favorites and now my girls have the same love for it that I have, no complaints at all
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 9year old grandson and I played it we had a great time he would do some and I would do other floors it was nice to play a challenging game with him we can't wait for more floors
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Monsters inc is obviously one of the best movies so needless to say my daughters and I love it and are satisfied
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|When I heard &#34;Still Into You&#34; I was a little hesitant to hear the rest of the album but I ended up falling in love with every song. &#34;Last Hope&#34; might be my favorite, though.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|A waste of time....! It sucked and I will never do another review for movies or TV I watch on my Kindle. OK you got 16 more words are you happy : (
B007HXL1V0|5.0|Well I had no idea how to deal with children rivalry. Now, my wife is pregnant so I bought this book. I'm much more confident I'll be able to prevent many conflicts by using the concepts viewed in this book.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The writing is fast paced and witty. One of my favorite reads. I think I will grow a goatee and get some more tats!
B0044XV3QY|3.0|This movies cinematics are great, the art work is great, the sound is great, the storyline is what is should be for a being written in the early 90's, but the box.....this box has too many annoying steps, I would have preferred a standard case
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a handy calculator to have.  I use it at work and while shopping.  Buttons are responsive, display is easy to read.  Will not use the one on my phone any more.  This feels to the touch like a calculator should.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|If you like club bangers this is not the album for you. But if you would like a album with heart and enough courage to not be the plain old pop rap well then this cd might be for you. This whole cd to me feels like what should be more expected in rap and maybe a new start to the washed out, over used stereotypes of the genres. Hip hop really should be one of the most interesting forms of music in modern day. This cd changed my mind about a form of music i felt had lost its heart, i would say i listen to a good amount of music in all genres and not only is this one of my favorite rap albums its one of my favorite albums in general.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Its a fun game that keeps my attention while not being so difficult that I get so frustrated.  I look forward to the update.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love this movie because it's romantic, funny, touching and still fairly realistic!  Great actors and settings! Recommend it to everyone!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I was looking for a couple of CR2032's for my garage door opener at a reasonable price and this pack was perfect.  I would recommend these highly.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|this book was amazing. i was shocked and i really loved this book about two thumbs up for thirteen reasons why.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game it is fun n keep u going if u like horse u should play it but don't buy anything
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick does an exemplary job of blending historical fact with uplifting encouragement!  The beautifully enduring underlying theme throughout this book is one of hope and a strong commitment to your beliefs. Tesla should be touted as a national hero for all he was by way of flawless character and for all he's done for mankind.  Sean Patrick brings to light both of these and more, and masterfully blends them with the ideals of application to self.  Extremely well done!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|When I first saw this game I thought that it was going to be as crappy as the first one but this one is a lot better than the first one.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i must admit that i usually hate Disney's app games but Nemo has been pretty good. My daughter loves it and so do I.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Even though this book is 1000 pages, I wanted more. I honestly loved this book just as much as the first one. The story is so fantastic and original. The writing style is beautiful without being too over the top and there is not one moment that I was bored. I honestly could not put this book or the first one in the series, The Name of the Wind, down. The characters are incredibly real!<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy at all you should read these books. However, you might want to wait until the third one comes out or you'll be tortured by the long wait! I would bet that this will eventually be made into a movie but it could never do it justice in a million years. Patrick Rothfuss is better than Rowling and well on par with Tolkien in the creation of a unique fantasy realm full of mystery, intrigue, and adventure.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! This Crossfire Series is awesome! Cant wait for the 4th book and the ability to preorder!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I even found myself thinking about it throughout the day. It is definitely detailed in all of the many sexual encounters but I thoroughly enjoyed the characters personalities and the story line. I honestly laughed out loud and cried throughout this trilogy. I am so glad that I got the trilogy. I was able to finish one book and immediately start on the next. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
0345803485|5.0|Happy with it and intend to get the rest of them Well written & of great interest Thank you Bernadette
B000059T1E|4.0|Doheny Beach, 1971<br /><br />This was the first time as a teenager I had seen the waves meet the shore at night. And it was transfixing the way the white water would appear out of nowhere. The soundtrack for this moment was `Glad', specifically the second part of it. The mystery and the drama of the unknown are caught within that sound, the ebb and flow of the tide, the things unseen in the darkness.<br /><br />A year after Traffic broke apart in 1969, three members, Winwood, Wood and Capaldi, meet up in the studio and started making music so good that they knew they had to reform the band. They gave us \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\", a mixture of rock and folk with a jazzy feel to it. The music made here would galvanize into the Traffic sound that would continue thru their next few albums, though Capaldi would never be as dominant, as by the time of `Welcome To The Canteen\\", Rebop and Gordon would come to the fore.<br /><br />Piano and drums kick off the album, and once they are backed up by organ and sax, `Glad' turns into a jazz romp, a happy sound, befitting its name, before it moves into something else all together. It is clear right off the bat that Traffic has come back stronger than ever.<br /><br />`Freedom Rider' takes us out of this jazz and into rock territory, despite the fact that the flute seems to drive the piano and bass during the mid section. Capaldi`s drums snap and bite at you the whole way thru while Wood's flute takes flight. A double flute solo no less. Jethro Tull must have been salivating.<br /><br />Piano and folk guitar lead us into `Stranger To Himself'. The bass and drums come in and support Winwood's theme of misplaced values. He adds several lead solos and electric guitar touches, making this another rocking tune that fits well with `Rider'. These perfect arrangements are dramatic, pulsating and modern and yet still seem to have that hippy feel of their earlier albums.<br /><br />`Empty Pages' and `Every Mother's Son' continue the overall feel of the album, with organ and electric guitar leading the way. There are many who consider this a perfect album, but to me these two songs are just okay and not up to par with the others. If `I Just Want You To Know' was the original end of `Empty Pages', they should have left it that way, as it gives it a nice run out. To me that would have made it better.<br /><br />And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn must die.<br /><br />The oldest known telling of John Barleycorn may be from 1568. In 1970, Traffic used folk guitar and flute to bring this traditional tale alive. A touching balled of beer and whiskey no less. John is the beer of course, the barley mistreated. You thought Mary Juana was an illegal, poor John Barleycorn. This song is one of the all time greats, with the triangle and wood knocks giving it an ancient feel.<br /><br />Grab yourself a bottle of The Glenlivet and give this one a listen, because when all is said and done, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is a rock classic.<br /><br />And the tinker, he can't mend kettle or pots, without a little Barleycorn.l feel of the album, with organ and electric guitar leading the way. There are many who consider this a perfect album, but to me these two songs are just okay and not up to par with the others.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like that you can take care of your own horse--you can do everything from grooming to feeding. However, some of the minigames kind of... freeze, I guess. Like When you measure the grain, for some reason, I can't measure the 2nd type of gain. But maybe that's just me...
B0085RQLXK|4.0|There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture.<br /><br />For my time, \\"The Outer Limits\\" was always better than \\"The Twilight Zone\\". After a decade, Aerosmith returned from both places and finally put out a new album. They tried to tell us it was just like old fashioned Aerosmith, but they do not seem to understand that more than one ballad will not fit in that picture.<br /><br />Like a box of candy, you're not always going to like everything you get, but the good stuff is still good. No one is forcing you to eat the ones you don't want. If you don't like the ballads don't listen to them. The great 70's Aerosmith albums were between 34 and 39 minutes long. This one is over an hour long. The band has given you more than you need to make this a really good album, so the trick here is to just pare down the songs to your liking.<br /><br />Here are my 40 minutes:<br /><br />1.  Luv XXX<br />2.  Oh Yeah<br />3.  Beautiful<br />4.  Out Go The Lights<br />5.  Legendary Child<br />6.  Street Jesus<br />7.  Lover Alot<br />8.  Something<br />9.  Closer<br /><br />Hot monkey sex on a hot tin roof<br /><br /> `Luv XXX' is your typical great Aerosmith hard rock tune. This is what you came for. Fast riffs with drums hitting the mark, it can fit right in beside any of their other album rockers. It has a power drum section and it has those speedy vocal sections of Steven's which end in a flat out yell where you have no idea what he is singing, but you know he's into it.<br /><br />You're the stars in my sky<br /><br />`Oh Yeah' has a somewhat lighter feel, like a rock and roll song you would hear in the 60's. That may be because they have girls singing back up. It is supposed to have horns on it too, but I cannot place them, they blend so well. The band is defiantly pumping on this one and we get several wild leads by Joe. I can't sit still. No way.<br /><br />I think you best believe it<br /><br />Cartoon footsteps lead us into `Beautiful'. It too is hard rock and it sounds to me like it came right off of \\"Just Push Play\\", having that same sound as `Trip' and `Outta'. It has rap rock verses that slow right into a heavy chorus which seems to have layers of voices. Mia gets to sing on Daddies record this time, but I cannot place her either, as there are a lot of vocals going on in the back ground of this tune, some like whispers, and some like screams. We get a false ending in the middle as well as a twisted Perry lead that is way too short. But Joey's drums sound real good. And listen to the bass bottom out at the end. Oh yeah.<br /><br />Living on coochie and romance<br /><br />`Out Go The Lights' is rock and roll too, but maybe with a little more southern funk, more reminiscent of the 70's, sounding like something the Black Crowes would write. The backup girls shine on this one too. The band sounds so good, laying down a heavy, measured pace. Just when you think they have ended it in harmonica, it comes back to rock you some more. Joe picks thru the notes like a wasted tightrope walker trying to keep his balance. This time it ends with the girls going \\"whoop a loop\\". Great stuff.<br /><br />Token on that pipe of peace<br /><br />`Legendary Child' is hard line Smith, but it seems to be lacking that something extra. It is still a decent track though and the more you listen to it the more it grows on you. To me it is too basic to be considered among their best.<br /><br />And Mr. Bartender, another beer<br /><br />`Street Jesus' sounds just like \\"Rocks\\", and it has a bit more variety in it than most of the others here. It starts off with a siren and the man on the street telling us the time of reckoning is coming. A slow pounding beat from Joey, surrounded by the two guitars, sets the ground for Steven's story. Then it then turns into a `Rats' rocker, spitting out fiery guitars and vocals. We also get a \\"who, haw\\" chorus that leads into a double guitar solo that may be both Joe and Brad. Joey then beats it out and Steven raps it up, trying to keep up with him, until it ends in a long percussive groove.<br /><br />You get a high from the taste of her wet<br /><br />`Lover Alot' starts out with Joey pounding the skins, then stopping and yelling. He starts up again and like before, Steven starts spitting out words trying to keep up with him. Once again we have a pure Aerosmith rocker, as good as they get. This album is one clear recording; just listen to Steven carrying on in the background during the mid section. The two guitars come thru nicely here, running along at the same time.

B0073TB3W0|5.0|gives you lots of facts and study results in easy to understand terms. Also has a good Q&A in the back, as well as a list of foods to eat, and what to avoid and why. Very eye-opening. I now understand food labels better. And I don't think I'll ever look at the grocery store in the same way again
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was happy to find this game. I like to play solitaire when I have a few minutes. It is very relaxing and challenging for me. I like trying to win more than lose. I would recommend this game to all my friends.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game I love it!!!!!!! Play all the time. I wish it was a little harder but it is still addictive.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has proven to be a master of intertwining the intimate lives and stories of many characters over decades and across continents, and this book is no different. The depth of the characters keeps you enthralled while the epic heartbreak keeps your eyes moist. There is no happy ending, only the silver lining of discovering unexpected joy in the little things in this life. This book is heartbreaking and beautiful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this<br />Game it is so fun I want to have I real horse and this Is just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

B008BU75IQ|5.0|Couldn't put this book down once I started it. What a cliff hanger ending. Can't wait to start 2nd book in series
B0052UZIFA|3.0|On one hand, the core game is great.  On the other hand, it's still on version 1.2 literally years after release.  The Google Play version is 5.0.0, with all the extra modes (Zen garden, special challenges, etc).  Even the DRM-free Humble Bundle version, which earns no revenue at all anymore, is version 2.9.1.  Ridiculous.  Boycott this version until EA pushes out version 5... which they will probably never do, now that the freemium PvZ2 is on the horizon.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's GOOGLE for Kindle. Whats not to want to download it for? how else are you going to get around on the web?

B0064QNS62|2.0|I found it to be the type of game that one would be better off using with a real controller.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|hard to follow at times, but I really did enjoy this book. It did at times become very predictable, but there was enough to keep me interested.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|If you're a fan of Cirque Du Soleil, this is a perfect movie for you.  Who said you have to be in Vegas to see them.  I absolutely love it.
0345803485|1.0|***WARNING: This review may contain spoilers, if you actually give a crap.***<br /><br />I'm an author myself, and I spend a lot of time writing erotica, and I can honestly tell you that this book is not \\"erotic\\" by any means, but a childish attempt at sounding \\"sexy\\" to win over both Twilight fans and the types of people who would read trash like Twilight.<br /><br />I've read the book, and many reviews. I have to say that anything rated five stars is really overstating, that the reader's fantasies are just as strange as the author's, but it's not appraisal of the book's true contents-- it CAN'T be, because the book is awful. I find it difficult to suggest otherwise, and I find it disgraceful that any person, male or female, would find this even remotely likeable. \\"E. L. James\\" is a TV executive, so the only reason this book got so much hype and did so well is because she had connections, not because the book is well-written or worth reading.<br /><br />First of all, one of my major issues with this book has already been lambasted to death-- the sophomoric fashion in which the author writes. Some might call that a trivial grievance. Others will flat out lie to themselves and actually call it \\"good writing.\\" I'm ashamed to admit I've also read the first Twilight book, which was so agonizingly boring that I never bothered to continue reading the series, but this was somehow WORSE than Twilight, which until now, I didn't think was possible. Yeah this contains \\"BDSM,\\" if you want to call it that, but it's about as kinky as listening to your grandmother tell tales about how she and your grandfather \\"got funky together\\" back in the day... assuming your grandmother has a noisy, irritating \\"inner goddess\\" and blushes a lot (and E. L. James is fifty years old and claimed the book was her \\"mid-life crisis,\\" so it makes sense). Secondly, you could literally skip most of the book and still get the idea of what is happening. Half of the book you don't even need to read, becauseit's mostly girly conversations about how \\"smokin' hot\\" Grey is and \\"OMG they had sex.\\" Imagine someone publishing e-mail transactions about their sex life while also including \\"girl talk\\" and boring sex scenes. That's Fifty Shades. There, you just read a 514-page novel in ten seconds.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point: do women ACTUALLY WANT THIS? Christian Grey, from the start, is wholly incompatible with Ana on every level (hell, any man would be incompatible with her). Her first impression is that he's arrogant and controlling, but she swoons over him and melts like beef gravy. I've never read the phrase \\"smoky gray eyes\\" so often followed up by palms-up fainting. The second indication that they're incompatible is that she forces herself into situations just for him, and no, that does not make her a \\"submissive,\\" that makes her \\"dependent.\\" What's worse than a dependent is someone who takes advantage of a dependent, and Grey does that, many times. When Grey asks her out for coffee, she agrees to it despite hating coffee. She doesn't state her opinion, \\"Well, I don't really like coffee,\\" or speak her mind in other ways. She waits until they're already at the coffee shop to say anything. That would be almost okay if Grey didn't practcially force her into the situation and she agreed to it. It's just \\"hrrrrmmmm... eeehhhhh.... muuuummmble.... ooookaaaay Misterrrr Greeeeey.\\" It's lunacy, with a capital L. I have to wonder what James' husband thinks of all this. I wonder if he's the type to think, \\"Is that what she really wants? Am I good enough?\\" I almost feel sorry for him. It's not like she wrote about characters that she worked on for years that she became attached to and loved in her own way; this was her FANTASY, which she admitted.<br /><br />Another scenario I found bizarre was when Jose' makes a pass at Ana while inebriated, and she fumes at him, even the following day, ignoring his apology calls. I don't even think he got to kiss her. Meanwhile,Grey sexually assaults her in the elevator and she swoons and oozes over it. This scene alone showed that Ana is much snobbier than the author probably would have liked her to be, indicating that you can make passes and kiss her without question whenever you'd like, as long as you have billions of dollars, have \\"smoky gray eyes,\\" and listen to opera in your Audi.<br />Even this ridiculous contract Grey hands out is barely about \\"dominance\\" and \\"submissiveness,\\" but it's about controlling someone else and everything they do and abusing them if they don't. There is a difference between \\"dominance and submissiveness\\" and \\"taking advantage of dependent people.\\" If I engage in BDSM, I don't want that leaving the bedroom. I don't want to spend my life as someone's slave-- no one of a sane, rational mind would. When someone tells you to sign something stating that they control not only what you eat every day, but how you dress and where you go, you don't sit there like an idiot debating whether or not it's a good idea to agree with it. YOU RUN. FAR (which takes Ana to get BEATEN before she realizes). It's made strictly for feeble, foolish minds that are too weak and dependent to make their own choices, and those people do not need contractual obligations with a sexy rich man. They need help to get through their day-to-day life that is likely filled with anxiety. When you really think long enough about it, the very concept of this is just awful and inhumane. After the playful sex, you don't want your boyfriend to say \\"well, laters, baby,\\" (not that I'd ever accept \\"laters baby\\" as a fond term of endearment... it's incredibly childish and stupid) and go home, and if you were like me or anyone with dignity or self-esteem, you wouldn't tolerate because you think he neeeeeeeds yoooouu.<br /><br />On the topic of the contract Christian has written up, Ana later has issues with it, that he argues with as much as possible-- but his final explanation is:<br /><br />\\"Anastasia, it doesn't matter if it's legal or not. It represents an arrangement that I would like to make with you - what I would like from you and what you can expect from me. If you don't like it, then don't sign. If you do sign, and then decide you don't like it, there are enough get-out clauses so you can walk away. Even if it were legally binding, do you think I'd drag you through the courts if you did decide to run?\\"<br /><br />I have just ooooone little question regarding this: WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THE CONTRACT, THEN (SHOUTY CAPITALS)?! Why do you even have a contract AT ALL?! If it's all about \\"you can leave when you want to, you don't have to do anything you don't want to, it's not legally binding, and I won't take you to court,\\" what the hell was the reason for forcing me to read several pages worth of a contract that didn't ever need to exist?!?!<br /><br />Let's just get to the main point: it's badly written, it's a bad \\"story,\\" and it's bad for society. I can safely admit that I watched a pornographic adaptation of this book, and the acting was terrible, but it was still better than reading it, because at least it was more fun to watch the sex instead of tearing my hair out at how annoying it is to read the way James writes about it. Sure, I was laughing for most of it and watched it with deadpan stoicism, but it was still better than the book. This book series tells people that women are mere dainty weaklings with no personalities and need to be controlled by powerful men. The protagonist is a whimpering ninny who is constantly needs to be approved of and wanted and reminded she's a pwetty-wittle-snowfwake, who is too dim-witted to even read an NDA before signing it or understand what her feelings are when she has them, and I hear Christian is twice as bad as that in the sequel, so I have quite a ride ahead of me.  We are already in a bad enough state of sexism at it is, and this is just one of the things that makes it worse. Who in their right mind finds this arousing:<br /><br />\\"I don't want you to go.\\"<br />\\"Please... I have to.\\"<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Because you've given me so much to consider... and I need some distance.\\"<br />\\"I could make you stay,\\" he threatens.<br /><br />If Fifty Shades of Grey was written in a manner of showing how relationships like this are supposed to be a BAD thing, it might have been interesting, but it's written with a sense of worship for submitting yourself to an \\"Alpha Male,\\" and having any mind of your own is just senseless and pointless. It's better to let him tell you what to do. Yes, I'm aware that Ana breaks up with him at the end, but she rejoins him no less than three days later in the sequel. She's a sucker for torture.<br /><br />TL;DR: It's awful, don't buy it. It's unfair that this tripe is so popular when there are better writers out there who will never see the fortune she's earned.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is pretty fun. it is pretty easy and is good for all age ranges. I recommend it to every one.
034580404X|4.0|I bought the series since I have friends that recommended it. Looking forward to my marathon reading. I can't wait!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever!<br />i highly recomend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />and it updates right away<br />Buy this app it  is the best<br />WARNING: you might get slightly addicted
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Amazing book. Sylvia really knows how to draw you into a book. I couldn't put it down. No housework was done until I finished. I'm so excited about the next book and finding out what happens next. :-)
B0006B2A42|2.0|Just an old bomb over rated. A lot of famous people, big deal, not worth seeing more than once. Ptui.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|This has to be Sasha Baron Cohen's biggest disappointment.  While I appreciate the light-hearted comedy, this movie was so bad, I couldn't even watch it for more than 25 minutes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. Especially it you can't really have a horse and love them. This game is interactive , it's just like a real horse.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|loved the book and trhe series so far  -  just very disapointed that the suthor did no conclude the story like she said she would at the end of the second book
B004EPZ06G|5.0|great pice, great deliver... love this movie, have to purchase part 1 now.. and then get part 3 when comes out they are a bunch of mess lol
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Excellent spinoff of Stargate SG-1 with a new threats and different worlds to explore.  The new cast is great even though I still feel very partial to SG-1.
B008220AVW|5.0|great price, great delivery, good movie... saw this in the theater and me and my niece enjoy ourselves... so i had to get the dvd
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, scenery is amazing. Can't wait for 2014, sad it will be the last. If they killed off Matthew, my wife may not watch next season!!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Great must read book. This was a follow up to my reading a couple books about the dust bowl. This was one of my quickest big book reads. Just couldn't put it down. I was always scared off by the length of the book, but it read quickly.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Well I had this book preordered for greater than 6mon!  I love Sylvia Day books and the Crossfire series (I think is one of her best). I was a bit disappointed as I thought this was the closure but then I find out there are going to be 2 additional novels in this series. I will order the next two - just wish there wasn't such a long wait in between releases.
B00013RC8O|4.0|a great car chase movie from the early 70's. Fantastic on location shooting makes you feel as if you are actually there.  The audio commentary gives a lot of background information about where the movie was filmed.<br />  As one would expect, the movie feels a bit dated because of the drug/Vietnam/dropping out of society themes. But its actually a great movie to get a genuine feel for the era and the societal issues facing the country at the time. I think anyone wanting a look at 1970 USA will not be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Very easy to use. I would definitely recommend this app to friends. Especially helpful for weather alerts. This. App will be used often
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Cool free game and quite relaxing to play. Just clean, old fun! Would recommend to people of all ages and genders :).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. It gets you to thinking about different ways to solve the puzzles and the floors to get to the next level.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Some people hide getting old, and others hide getting fat, but Buddy Guy doesn't have to hide anything, because he's getting old with style and grace, he doesn't seem to have gained an ounze in the last 10 years, and his songs are just as strong if not stronger than ever.  He's the man!
B002KGEORM|5.0|One of the best TV shows of 2008. I just wish it would be at least 3 seasons longer. Bring it back!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Couldn't stop playing.  My 10 year old son loved it too!  Need more levels!!!  Hope they come soon!!
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I purchased this adapter months ago and had never been able to get it to work with my 15\\" MacBook Pro (Retina). After I plugged it in, the LEDs would come on briefly, then go out. If I brought up the Console window utility, I would get messages about some kind of conflict when I plugged the adapter in.<br /><br />Today, I finally found the problem. The application \\"Android File Transfer\\" has a background agent process which caused the conflict. Once I got rid of that process, this adapter worked perfectly the next time I plugged it in. It takes a bit of work to keep the Android agent process from reappearing. Here's a good article which explains how: [...] (If that link gets stripped from my review, just do a web search for \\"taming-android-file-transfer-on-mac-os-x\\")<br /><br />Now that I have it working, I am very pleased. I can leave this device connected to my USB 3.0 hub which acts as my docking station. I really prefer this to using the Apple Thunderbolt adapter which is just one more thing hanging off of my laptop which needs to be reconnected each time I bring it back to my desk.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|So far the best movie of the year for me! Seen it multiple times already and still counting. This is a must have
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've only started playing it, but I am enjoying the challenge of finding the clues and figuring out how to put them together to solve the puzzle of each floor.  I just need to figure out how to get the annoying music to stop.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|People always approach this book knowing that it is very different than Ender's Game and that scares them away from ever picking up it's sequel.  Its true, it is very different.  But you are missing out if you dont continue with the series of a book you loved so much.  And it will surprise you, you might find you like it just as much.
1451695195|5.0|If your looking for a book that provides you with deep sense of comfort based on the afterlife, written from a scientific, yet passionate author, this is it.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Easy to navigate on the kindle fire. It also has lots of storage. I really enjoy reading books on it. The only downfall is you can't have a wallpaper. Love it
0425263924|1.0|Ok so I'm the sort of reader that always sees a book through no matter what !!!!!!! I'm about 76% in and hating it. The storyline is weak, their love isn't lovely anymore. It obsessive, possesive, and too much. I want some depth from these two. They've have some horrific stuff happen and for them to do some of the sex acts they do is unrealistic. I think Cary had great potential in the first book to grow. He is now an Eva flunky. The affair between her folks is interesting but needs more developing. The sex needs to be cut down. Every time they're together they end up having sex that you become immune to it. I would love for Eva and Brett to end up together. How can Gideon get away with murder and killing someone to protect someone you're obsessed with is crazy. I agree with one reviewer that said she doesn't love Gideon the way he loves her. She would want to spend the rest of her life with him the way she goes on and on about him and his member and what it does for her. I find think she's dipping too much in FSof G territory. Come lady you've got an audienc give us some original material. I don't know ifmI will finish this book much less continue to book 4. What more could you possibly say. I can't handle anymore conversations that lead to no where.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the Crossfire series. Didn't want it to end. Great mix of a good story with the hot romance. Can't wait for her next series
B000YMMN04|3.0|I grew up in a town very much like Pleasantville. It was a pleasant trip &#34;back in time&#34;.<br />Family friendly
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z - which the movie is only loosely based on - is a series of interviews before, during and after the zombie apocalypse.<br />While some of this is standard zombie-genre material covered by every author, I really enjoyed the depth Mr. Brooks went into regarding the various nefarious ways zombies found access to their tasty prey, and the ingenious ways the surviving humans discovered to dispatch them.<br />The damage to a persons psyche is also explored in depth - what toll would it take upon the survivors to fear for your life and your family everyday? Fascinating book.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I've really been enjoying this game and then suddenly it will not play any more. As I read the review more I see this happens on the Kindle after you get so far. Beautiful...
B0049P1N3K|5.0|The amazing gift that the Power has to offer us! I have read this book over and over and still find something new to learn from the powerful words inside this book.  Life transforming no matter what religion or background you come from.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Really liked this one. It had all the intertwined story lines that Connelly is so very good with and then the final twist. There is no one better than Michael Connelly.
B00AW57L96|4.0|A really good read I could relate to all the characters such a sad story and how it can affect your whole life. It's very interesting at how it all comes together and what goes around comes around!
0553582038|3.0|Sure Martin has skills and ideas. I can also appreciate his grand vision: imagine a huge palette, but avoid faceless, `minor' characters - take the time and space to paint characters from a range of levels, whether their story is success or failure. But ultimately this lacks story. It's not several stand-alone stories entertainingly twining around each other. It's the transparent tactic of keeping readers hooked by splitting the action - readers are not so much hooked by what they're reading than by what they're trying to get back to (it's like that Seinfeld line about channel-surfing men not being so interested in what's on TV as what *else* is on TV). And while namesake double-R could be excused for doing this with two parties, George double-R does it for dozens of parties. Several may be left in their cliff-hanging situations for entire books!
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I don't know how to tell you about the problem but I just opened it for the first time for my granddaughter to watch and in several places kind of gets stuck and I have to use my fast forward to get to a place it'll play.  This happens a couple of times while we were watching it.  I tested some of the other DVD's that I have and it played fine so it's a problem DVD.  I threw away the box and the packing slip so I don't have a way to return it.  The Blu-Ray that came with it is fine.
0393325172|5.0|I read this before I started writing reviews - I've got several way more detailed responses to later books. But here is where to start, and this is a fantastic series - the only one I've read that's kept the high standard beyond the first two or three (more often things peak at #1 - but this, while a thoroughly enjoyable read - is not the best of the lot). If this is all you've read you can look forward to a wonderful journey...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This novel is our book club's selection for July.  There is enough &#34;meat&#34; in this story to generate significant discussion among the members.  I enjoyed reading Hosseini's latest book; although I did not find it to be of the same caliber as his first two novels.  There are several parallel plots in the novel and sometimes you're inserted into a new plot and trying to make connections with what you've already read.  I enjoy reading about Afghanistan and learning about the cultural differences.  It's pretty clear that there is a huge gulf between their culture and the West.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Even after multiple viewings, the movie is still awesome!  Plus, if you watch it anywhere but online (Roku, Smart TV, etc) you can get it in full HD and 5.1 surround.  Both are a must for this one!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Dissappointed....seemed like nothing happened....just enough to let you know another book in the series coming.<br />I give up and no longer care about Eva and Gideon!
B00AMS2FV2|4.0|Enjoyed watching the movie with my family. Exciting and fun to watch. Inspired my kids (youngest is 15) to go for a bike ride.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I don't follow Thor's comics, so I can't really say how much of the movie can really be compared. I know the general story of Thor's fate is similar, but again, I never read any of the comics nor have any of my friends that do told me. As a standalone movie separate from comic comparisons, I found this to be a typical Marvel film. Lots of action, comedic relief, dramatic arc, and more action. There's a couple corny moments I wish were left out, but this does have to appeal to a wider variety of audience.<br /><br />Overall, it was an ok movie.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|As strong as [[ASIN:B0029LHW4U Black Gives Way To Blue]]', this album is equally impressive and equally powerful. Vocally, J. Cantrell dominates the album - his double- and triple-tracked lines echoing the greatest moments of '[[ASIN:B0012GMUSQ Sap]]' and '[[ASIN:B00138GWYQ Jar Of Flies]]', all while invoking some of the more tormented tones of '[[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]]' across some of the heavier pieces.<br /><br />Sadly, W. Duvall takes a lesser role across the album, but the tracks he does contribute to are brilliant again, and when he's employed to produce those glissandos and more acrobatic set-pieces, the album only benefits further. When the two vocalists mix (as in 'Pretty Done' or 'Phantom Limb'), the real brilliance of the album is revealed.<br /><br />Guitar tones are exceptional, with dirt, power and clarity all present - the riffs passed through are simple, tasty, powerful and usually brilliantly simple. They are also very listenable and downright catchy.<br /><br />There is no weak point on the album, however trivial, and the production (while less bombastic than BGWTB) is nevertheless punchy and full, with the acoustic tracks holding their own within the album and alongside 'Jar of Flies' - just listen to 'Choke', or 'Voices' if you doubt it.<br /><br />The band have shown that there is a real post-Staley future, and J. Cantrell's song-writing, meshed with Duvall's adaptable talents (he's an accomplished guitarist, too) only benefit from great production and a rhythm section that nail it every time.<br /><br />Excellent album with strong compositions, dynamics, and a convincing release that proves Alice in Chains have so much more to give. If BGWTB proved their new line-up, this album concretes it and confirms a bright second life for Alice in Chains.
1400064287|1.0|I have read many books on various subjects, not just marketing. This book is the worst one I've read in marketing and one of the worst books I've read in general. These guys are clearly not writers, I read two books a week and somehow they still managed to put a reader like me to sleep. What's worst is that the subject of the book is to make your content stick. Please do yourself a favor, stay far away from this book. I regret wasting my money on this thing, I want a refund, I have been robbed. How in the world did this get so many 5 stars in the first place? The authors of the book speak as if they were speaking to kindergarden students. If you don't believe me, go ahead and waste your money only to find out I was not kidding.
B0054LRR3S|5.0|very smooth and unique sound. i could listen to this while working. sbtrkt definitely has an ear for creating music that isn't too trashy and not too indy.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|QT rarely disappoints and I think this is one of the better ones. Entertaining from beginning to end. Worth renting for sure.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am amazed how much I enjoy this game. The prizes are cute, the gameplay isn't too slow &amp; there aren't that many glitches. I would recommend adjusting your kindle so you can't purchase content, or you might find it easy to spend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game to play when u are bore or are on a trip. I like how every few weeks it's a different city n different challenges
B008JFC6F0|3.0|I'm a Boomer, and this is a pretty recent release. I had heard one song (Elephant) on a commercial or something, and decided to buy the whole album. I think I'll find a younger person to give the album to. Nothing wrong with it at all, just not something I care to listen to over and over.
6302779278|5.0|love Kevin Costner's performance as Frank Farmer. I find him very convincing and  self-disciplined guy with a heart of gold. I admire Kevin's portrayal of Frank's emotional torment when he had to choose between his duty and his heart.<br /><br />Whitney Huston is surprisingly good and her enormous musical talent makes up for her lack of acting experience.
B000000OTY|5.0|There are a few different formats in which you can enjoy and experience the Secret World tour. The CD set is very good; I think the DVD is even better. I was a bit disappointed that some of the songs I loved from the DVD are not present on the CD set; but the reverse is also true. A song missing from the CD set is &#34;San Jacinto&#34; which is my favorite song on the DVD. That said, the CD stands on its own right and I love it.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time.  Usually, horror movies are about the same; young kids in a shack in the woods, blood, guts, killing, nudity, sex.  Mama is nothing like that.  It is scary.  But the story line is one-of-a-kind.  If you like horror and being thrilled, don't miss Mama.  The two children are excellent characters, especially Lily.  She is adorable even in the beginning.  This is one of my favorites and I've lost count of how many times I've watched it!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is absolutely amazing.  The only subtraction is the voice acting - guess they couldn't afford Robert Downey Jr...
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I love his version of these songs, super talented and even channeled Roy Orbison a little bit.  Could have had a few more songs on it though.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've had the privilege to read.  I had every emotion that a human can experience in life within a 4 hour period of reading this book.  Easy read... yet will leave a mark on my life that will guide me forever.  People often say in jest they wish they had a manual that would instruct them throughout life.  THIS IS THAT BOOK.  I will be sharing this with my children and anyone else I can convince to read this.  Mitch I believe this was what added purpose to your life.  You, along with \\"coach\\", will live on forever in you written words and through these basic life lessons.
B008OJ291W|4.0|This sounded good to me.  His vocals are great, I didn't mind the faux orchestra parts too much, and the songs have held up well over time.  Good Stuff!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved book three, but I was disappointed on how the book ended. I can't wait for the next book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Wow it's like the real my little pony series. I would recommend it to all my friends so they can love it to.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Performances from the leads are excellent (although Morgan Freeman's accent is inconsistent, Matt Damon's is spot on). These are two actors who rarely overdo it, and that reserve works to brilliant effect here. We watched it with our children, aged 8 & 10, and they also really enjoyed it. The film prompted many questions from them about South Africa's history, particularly its racial history, and this was a very good thing indeed. We were able to tell them all about Nelson Mandela (they even looked him up online themselves) AND it has made our son interested in rugby (which is not widely played where we live in the New Hampshire sticks). Overall a tremendous film experience & everything you want a film to be.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|.This was  A fun  game. I can't wait for  more floors to open up it really test it mind skills.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|I don't care if people say this film is &#34;manipulative&#34; -- ALL films -- in fact almost all stories -- are manipulative. This film is brilliantly conceived/written and expertly executed. I cannot say enough about this movie and I cannot wait until my children are old enough to show it to them. All hail Roberto Benigni!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game!!! It is great for a long car ride to pass time. If you really like challenging games this is the game for you!!! You need to get this game!!! The one thing is that after you pass level 10 you have to rate the game to get more levels... other than that, it's a great and fun game!!!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|As always Denzel comes through with his performance in this film.  Good, strong cast of characters and a good plot.  I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoy Bourne or similar type movies.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Mr. Grisham has always been my favorite author. The characters were compelling the tension was palpable and the writing was perfect.
B006ICGH56|5.0|I have always liked this film.  Very convincing 50s area film with a excellent cast of characters.  The stars of this film make the difference and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys stepping back into the past and imagining what it was like to live during that time.
0553593544|2.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" (the 1980 novel) is a mess. \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (the 2002 movie) is a minor masterpiece.  Equally astonishing is that the two follow-up \\"Bourne\\" movies (in 2004 and 2007) were just as sparkling and inventive as the first.  For sustained high quality, the 2002-2007 \\"Bourne\\" trilogy is one of the marvels of modern Hollywood movie-making.  Too bad the inaugural novel of the \\"Bourne\\" trilogy does not remotely approach the fluid style, conciseness, and inventiveness of the movie of the same name.<br /><br />Of course, thoughtful and attentive readers will find both the novel and movies far-fetched.  This is scarcely a problem in the movies, because the speed of their action and the mystery of the protagonist's situation give watchers little opportunity to dwell on the improbabilities of the plot.  By stripping out some of the more roccoco plot elements, the movie's screenwriters also make the action somewhat more plausible.<br /><br />Implausibility is not the greatest sin in fiction.  Great novels can have great implausibility (think \\"Huckleberry Finn\\").  But skilled writers will make you suspend disbelief, something Ludlum (at least in this novel) seems incapable of doing.  The prose is overwrought and the hero singularly unappealing.  In this the novel contrasts strongly with the Bourne character memorably played by Matt Damon in the movie.  In addition, Bourne's love interest, though certainly the most appealing character in the novel, is much less distinctive and plausible than the quite different character winningly played by the great German actress Franka Potente.<br /><br />People who have seen the movies need not be worried that the movies take away the suspense of the novel.  The plot differences and even the differences in major characters are big enough so that readers will encounter plenty of surprises along the way.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest surprises is that an overlong, badly written, and confusingly narrated novel couldbe turned into such an entertaining and memorable film.  I kept doggedly reading to the end mainly to see how the movie screenwriters performed such a neat trick:  What did they jettison?  What did they keep?  What did they ignore altogether?  After reading the novel and seeing the film, most readers / moviegoers may agree with me that the screenwriters deserve A+ for their efforts.  Alas, the author deserves a gentleman's C, even from a generous grader.  Almost all that grade is earned for the ingenious conceit that fuels the action:  A spy who loses his memory.  Among the worst features of the writing is the truly horrendous dialog.  If you have friends or business acquaintances who speak like this, you would run for the exits.<br /><br />I managed to read volume 1 of Ludlum's famous trilogy.  There's no chance I'll be reading installments 2 or 3.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was so much fun. It kept me on my toes. My brain Is fried from trying to figure all those floors out.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|A great movie in its own right.  Very strong performances by a broad cast.  If you've never seen it, buy it!  If you have seen it, I probably don't need to tell you it should be in your permanent collection.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie deserved the Academy Award.  If you have not seen it, you must.  I was on the edge of my seat all the way!
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This game is ok it's just that it's hard to control listen to me it is reaaaly hard. it's kinda fun. but don't get it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is quickly becoming my favorite author.  His storytelling is amazing.  I look forward to the next book of his that I read.
B00466HM28|5.0|I bought this as a present for my boyfriend. He LOVES IT! it's perfect for him to put in his backpack so he can make his music at a park or coffee shop. Great price for this brand. No complications
B000FC1HBY|4.0|very good! keeps your interest and is never boring or slow. good character development and nice descriptive phrases. would totally recommend it
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate's imagination is awesome, but the story was plausible. I loved the characters and throughout the book I kept hoping that Cass somehow meets the real heroine in this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game represents a refreshing take on puzzle and uncluttered hidden object themes. I couldn't step away from this addictive exercise of the mental faculties! Mildly disappointed at the abrupt end, but this has quickly changed to eagerly awaiting new levels as they appear. BRAVO!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series. I didn't like the way the book ended. It just left you hanging. I can't wait til the next book comes out.
1452101248|4.0|This book has some amazing photos.  Unfortunately a lot of the ingredients are hard to find for myself and I am not vegan.  I would try some of these recipes though. They look amazing!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Good adventure mystery. This was my first DeMille novel and liked it...but it didn't keep me \\"in\\" as I like....a novel that I should've dozed through in two days took me a week. But I enjoyed it.
B009LGO88E|5.0|I chose this model because of the shape, it is comfortable and doesn't cause my hands to cramp. It also works with my US 3DS.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Don't deny yourself the pleasure of reading this series, nor let yourself be intimidated by the length of each book. They're divided into small chapters, each of which can be read in 15 or 20 minutes, max.<br />As is often the case, the books are better than the screen presentations.
B000002GZ1|5.0|Paul Butterfield was a very talented individual.  I would him consider him one of the better harmonica players to have every lived.  This band, for me, is legendary and this is their Debut Album released in 1965.  There's a lot more that can be said about the group and the other individual members.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Chicago blues rock.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|pretty good for a free to play game. plenty to do while you wait for your buildings and units to be built.
8866137634|4.0|It's a Moleskine and works very well as a nice notebook.  I use it very often and it came with 3 months of Evernote Premium which adds to the value of this Moleskine.<br /><br />I took one star off because, while I like writing in it, I find importing entries into Evernote to be far more bothersome than they make it seem.  I have an iPhone 4s and importing entries can be somewhat of a difficult task.  When importing pages into Evernote you use the Evernote app and your phone camera to scan the page.  The app definitely does a good job of making the page look white and getting good contrast with ink on the page but it has serious sizing issues.  Unfortunately there is no built in crop function within the app.  This means that I have to have it send the pictures it takes to the Photo app and use the built in crop tool on the iPhone to crop the page so that it's sized properly.<br /><br />Also in terms of price it's not a bargain.  But as I said before, it does come with three months of Evernote Premium.  Overall I recommend it and It is likely that I will continue to use it.  But, know that importing documents to Evernote takes some patience. Also there may be other cheaper notebooks out there that are just as easy to do this on.
030771652X|4.0|A second read for me of this book.<br />Sent as promised; lovely story told from an unusual point of view.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It's an import and as far as I know you cannot get the Circle Pad pro for Nintendo 3DS XL in america yet.  It works as it should and for some games it greatly improves gameplay.  I also think that it makes the device more comfortable to hold for a long period of time.<br /><br />It is easy to install and remove quickly which is nice because it makes the device significantly larger and less portable.  With the ease of removal size is not a big issue because you can easily leave it behind if you need the device to be smaller..<br /><br />If you want a second Circle Pad then get it.  As I said earlier it makes a significant difference in gameplay for the games that utilize it (unfortunately not all games are compatible with it).
B004GHNHVW|3.0|Nice album - not great.  But then, it's strictly a matter of taste.<br />I loved his other albums - just not this one.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums to come out in the past couple years.  It's not a one- or two-track wonder with 10 other junk tracks.  The entire album is great.  I highly recommend Capital Cities.
030745455X|5.0|Marvellous story.  Couldn't wait to get it, and it was worth the wait.<br />Highly recommended if you like damaged, strong, resourceful heroines<br />dishing out well deserved punishment.
B007PJLUG2|5.0|Love this movie! It's convenient to have it online.  We are traveling across the country and it's great to have it there online.
B003TU164W|5.0|Fits snugly without being tight. I can wear them all day on my feet and be comfortable.Best Teva so far !
0399160450|5.0|As is usual with Tom Clancy this large book involves many players acting over large geographic areas but essentially it is the potential confrontation between mainland China and the United States, It details many of the advanced weapons systems of China such as highly accurate long and short range missile systems which are so destructive as to seriously imperil  US air and naval forces. However the largest threat is that caused by super computer hacking at a mammoth level with a sophisticated cyber warfare system developed by a Chinese arch villain, Dr. K.K. Tong a math and computer genius (think Prof. Moriarity  of Sherlock Holmes fame) and his large organization heavily supported by the communist Chinese army. The capability of the hacking system developed has broken into the US defense systems as well as our national power grid and financial systems and can cripple our defenses and financial survivability. We know this threat is real since communist China and the US both have major interests in Asia. As China grows in power and seeks to dominate Asia and the East and South China Seas it will inevitably confront America's interests just as Japan's ambitions in the 1920's 30's and 40's did. The caution is of course that ways have to be found to ease such inevitable tensions. This book therefore becomes an interesting and cautionary tale.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Even though at this point in the series things are lacking, I can't help but love ALL these books. Charlaine Harris has really created a world with some dynamic and fun characters, and I'm so impressed that she's still keeping it alive. I'm looking forward to the next and final book. I'm not sure if it can be strung on much longer. These are short and fun novels that I have recommended to numerous friends, even if some of them didn't make it this far.
B001NA6096|5.0|One of the most romantic movies you'll ever watch. The director really knows how to visually tell a compelling story.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|What a page turner. The book takes off quickly and doesn't stop, what a fantastic read. I can't wait to read the second installment
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|If you're young, you have to watch this to learn how connecting with someone is so much more important than anything else.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing the buzz about this book, I had high hopes. Alas, the writing is so sloppy and tedious, I will only serve as a warning to others. The sex described is the only saving grace of this book, and sadly, even that isn't enough to save this book from mediocrity.<br /><br />We are supposed to believe that Ana, (oh Ana!), is an educated, capable 20-something college graduate in 2012. She is reserved, likes literature, and is roommates with the most beautiful woman in the world. She has chosen to remain a virgin through college, and yet, in spite of her shyness, she's willing to give up her virginity to a guy she barely knows with a \\"red room of pain.\\" Riiiiight. Was this story started in 1952? Ana sounds like a 50s housewife prototype, but she's gonna jump right in the sack with Gray? We don't even really get to know Ana, she's so busy mooning over Gray, that we don't really know what she looks like. Other than Gray wants to bite her lips, which is weird. Don't worry, if Kristin Stewart of Twilight fame is cast, she will be the perfect Ana. A lovely, if lifeless, caricature.<br /><br />Then there's Gray. At age 26, he's been a practicing sadist for ten years, all while earning an education, playing the piano, learning to fly, and amassing billions. How he had time to be a sub for his sadism tutor, I don't know. Maybe she was also his flight instructor. Aside from being the perfect male specimen, did you know that Gray was sardonic? The author uses this word no less than seven times. Why? There are at least seven other words in the English language that mean sardonic, so why not branch out, give the character some nuance? Sorry, too busy focusing on S&M!<br /><br />What drivel. I was taught a very important lesson in my writing classes, show, don't tell! I'm not sure who I'm more annoyed with, the mediocre writer, or the inelegant, inarticulate, sophomoric editor.  Would it have killed them to refer to a thesaurus once in a while? How about doing some actual editing? \\"Kill your darlings,\\" is excellent advice. James would do well to kill the BS notion of the \\"inner goddess.\\" It's stupid, demeaning, and frankly, more than a tad Sybil-esque.<br /><br />Dear God help us if she writes three more mediocre books from *his* point of view. Are we then to be subjected to the sardonic monologue of his \\"inner god\\"?  Will she use the word sardonic over and over again? I say that sardonically, the only word that seems to fit Gray, aside from beautiful.<br /><br />Even funnier are the cues James gives us to tell us Gray is a sadist. A huge red room with a medieval bed, and a cabinet of props. Red is the color choice for sadists? Everyone with a red dining room is now regretting that paint choice. Why not Star Trek uniforms? Or 200 thread count sheets? That would be torture to me. The authors descriptions of B&D are pretty vanilla, with sex scenes straight out of a romance novel, bubble baths and all. It was all I could do to finish reading the book.<br /><br />Why didn't I read the next two? I'm not a masochist.ting? \\"Kill your darlings,\\" is excellent advice.

B00B3EVNEE|4.0|I like that he's singing on this one. Real Robin guitar work on some great classics. I don't remember if he ever did any vocals before. Glad I have it in the cloud !!
B004WR125O|3.0|I have no comment on this product , because I have not used. From the reveiws I have read, I know it will perform as advertised. I have had success with past Onkyo products I expect nothing different from this product.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought about how this book ended for a while and finally decided that it ended the right way. I was satisfied.
B00A72989U|3.0|Have not had time to listen to entire CD. Really do like &#34; The Fire We Make&#34;, it is so smooth.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|MoboPlayer is fantastic for watching movies and TV shows. The myriad of controls and the ability to do a &#34;picture-in-picture&#34; mode are a pleasant addition.<br /><br />My one small issue, however, is just how buggy MoboPlayer is. There have been many times when I have had to Force Stop or even restart my kindle because MoboPlayer is acting up.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think that dragonvale id AWESOME!!!! I never really was interested in dragons, but dragonvale's dragons are cool!  Please try
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was very excited to open the final saga of Sookie. I read it all in one day, hoping it would get better. It did not. If you read the entire series and need closure, I would recommend reading it.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|I think Sasha Baron Cohen is a comic genius, but this movie fails left, right and center.  Not a single real laugh.  Weak.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I enjoyed it very much. It was an easy read and kept me interested throughout. It made me want to keep reading to find out more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these two and would love to have a Gideon. I love the story line and hope she will continue. Everyone needs some romance.
B0062KJ198|3.0|The movie was funny, but would not reach a greater portion of the population due to humor it would fly over a lot of heads.
B0087IT8LO|4.0|Otherwise a great movie.  Is there an English version?  Needed to hear their expression in English. The acting by both was great.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the first time I have read it and it is awesome. I wish that there are more books to come.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Again with the sci-fi.  I do enjoy watching how they bring back people after they have died.  It is interesting to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I liked how you not only get to do competitions but you can practice, dress, groom, clean up after them, and much more
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I had not read his earlier books, always found the topics very depressing. But I loved this book and his writing style. It is not easy to keep going back and forth in time and weave multiple characters into one single story-the relationship between a brother and sister. At no point do you struggle to keep track. I loved reading it
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book is truly amazing. I just started watching Ellen not to long ago and I love her. This book truly brings you closer to Ellen Degeneres. It is hilarious and not a book to miss.
0307887448|5.0|Fantastic book that I had trouble putting down.  I physically had to force myself to stop reading at times as I was travelling and wanted something to read on the plane.  If you love video games, MMOs, 80s movies and geeky pop culture in general you'll love this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. It's has the basics of taking care of a real horse. If you can't have a real horse then this is what you should get.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A Great app for the kindle. Numbers are big, makes it easy when you're speed adding. Definitely use this a lot!
0141345659|5.0|I, probably like most people, have heard so many good words and reviews about this book. So, I ordered it. Let me just say, from the first couple of pages this book had me hooked. I'm not much of a big reader, but I couldn't put it down. I finished it in about 2 days, which is practically unheard of for me. I love how John Green writes, I think the style is perfect. I laughed with this book, I definatley cried, and I love it. I would probably consider it the best book I've ever read in my whole life. And as for the price, I've seen the same paperback copy in store for much more than the price it's for here. Five stars!
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I bought this movie for my best friend. She told me that I should watch it because it's a great movie. I watched it when it came and I gotta say...it's a really cute story. I love the movie. The quality was great too...even though this movie was made a while back. =) I'm glad I got it for my friend.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good game for killing time i really like it. But you should not be able to run out of energy. I think that is kind of stupid.
B002KLOPF8|4.0|It captured the moral quagmire of our involvement in Vietnam.<br />One of the first and best of the gritty, realistic view of the US Military.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|A nice continuation of the Next Generation series, Mack starts to bridge the gap between the series and the Online game world in a most satisfactory way. Looking forward to finishing the series.

076535618X|5.0|I read the Old Man's War trilogy five years ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed the series. The Last Colony was my least favorite of the bunch back then. I would've given the first two books 5 stars each, and The Last Colony 4, which is still good in my book.<br /><br />Oh, how times have changed.<br /><br />I've recently completed the second read-through of the trilogy, five years later. I'm definitely older now, and perhaps more mature in my appreciation of a good story, but now The Last Colony competes with Old Man's War for my top spot, while Ghost Brigades has slipped down slightly.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on why The Last Colony improved with my age, but the story is fantastic. I really appreciate Scalzi bringing my favorite old man back for another tour, and the develop of Sagan is brilliant. Zoe is now an independent character of her own doing, and she shines as she exhibits traits of her adopted parents.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great conclusion to a great series, and this is one of the few stories I've read where I'm just not ready for the story to end, especially on the second read-through.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I may be the oldest admitted fan of \\"Daria\\" but I really enjoy this animated series. Since I only caught a handfull of the episodes when they aired on Noggin after its initial run on MTV, I have not seemed to miss any of the music that so many others lament about. The writing is sharp...and I just love Daria's cynical and forth-right view of the world. She and Jane make a good pair. Watching all of the episodes in sequence on the DVD set, part of me wishes that Daria and Trent had actually forged a relationship but it was not to be. If you have never seen \\"Daria\\", you won't be disappointed by investing in the complete series.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Read this book about a year ago and thought I'd write a review. This was a great book that I just couldn't put down once I picked it up. I was a little worried about reading it because of the subject and my own past experience, but the book had me looking at things (and life) in a different light. I would recommend it as a read for anyone, but please be aware that the book is emotional. I cried throughout the story.... it tugs at your heart and you can't help but to feel for the two families involved. Powerful, detailed and just plain well written in my opinion.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great app. It's magic the gathering, what else can I say. I haven't had any issues with it. Love that I can play it quickly.
B00BCOL5YS|3.0|I received the new Scott Walker boxset with high expectations. The format is attractive with a basically 5\\" square box which holds 5 cds, each enclosed in a double gate-fold cardboard jacket. Also included is an informative 15 page booklet authored by Rob Young with biographical facts on Walker as well as production notes on each album. So far so good. Unfortunately, at least for me, the problem begins when the music starts. The transfer to cd with this collection is overly \\"trebly\\" with very little midrange and/or bass presence. I \\"spot-checked\\" tracks on each cd and found this to be the case overall. For a compare/contrast session, I played tracks from the same albums released by Fontana Records on cd several years ago and found the sound to be much improved. I also played cuts from the Scott Walker \\"In 5 Easy Pieces\\" 5 cd anthology(yes, I'm a fan!) and again the sound quality is also superior. I will be looking forward to other opinions from reviewers of this new boxset's sonic quality or lack of.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|If you turn on closed captioning, you can at least figure out some of the dialog - otherwise you might get a bit lost! It was okay and have to admit that these actors had to go through LOTS of makeup changes, as each actor portrays several characters throughout the movie - unfortunately, that was the most entertaining part of the movie for me!

B00B23O96A|5.0|When I read some of the reviews before I bought this album, I was quite dejected. I thought to myself that maybe this time Eric hasn't put enough on this one. Then I attended Eric's 24th May 2013 Royal Albert Hall Concert, and bought this album subsequently, irrespective of these reveiws I had read so far. Guess what, I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this is actually a great set of songs Eric has put out. I especially like the chronology of these songs, some really dated, some fresh and new, and some lovely collaborations...together representing what Eric seems to be feeling and is wanting to communicate.<br /><br />Further on down the road, Angel, The folks who live on the hill, Gotta get over, All of me, Still got the blues, and Every little thing --- all these songs really stand out on this album for me. It's more than what I would have expected from a single album. The renditions are timeless especially Eric's vocals, and the musical treatment is top-notch!<br /><br />I'm happy to report (and share) that as a Clapton follower for 20 years, I am really enjoying this album. It makes my drive to office and back really enjoyable these days. As a musician, I'm inspired by the simple and yet amazing songs like \\"Angel\\"...JJ & Eric are a legendary duo. \\"Old Sock\\" is right up there for me along with some other recent good albums like Boz Scaggs's \\"Memphis\\", John Mayer's \\"Born and Raised\\", and Pat Metheny's \\"Unity Band\\".<br /><br />Hope you'll discover this gem and enjoy the \\"Old Sock\\"!

B008JFUPK8|3.0|Let me first say that I've always believed that Superman as a whole is somewhat dull.  Supes is bogged down by the fact that he ignited the Golden Age of Comics.  He's an almighty being with few, if any, flaws, and that makes him boring to me.  There have been many attempts over the years to \\"humanize\\" him and give him flaws on the printed page (all to varying degrees of success) and even an attempt on the big screen with \\"Superman Returns,\\" whenever he was given a son born out of wedlock to Lois Lane.  He's the perfect hero for youngsters, as his super powers make him a wonderful being to dream about and pretend to be while playing.  When puberty or another harsh reality of life hits and things become complicated, children turn to darker heroes such as Batman, Daredevil, etc.<br /><br />Now for my review.<br /><br />The film opens with the token destruction of Krypton, albeit with a slight twist in the relationship of the main antagonist, General Zod, and Jor-El.  Kal-El is sent to Earth with hope for the future entrusted to him by his father and mother.  Zod and his comrades are imprisoned, but not before they promise to find Kal-El.  Once they find him, their intentions are fairly obvious.  From there, we witness the development of Superman in real time and flashbacks.  I enjoyed this aspect of the film, as we got to see Kal-El experience and deal with things like heat vision, x-ray vision, super hearing, and super strength for the first time.  We also get to see him struggle with the urge to use his powers when certain situations call for them.<br /><br />Eventually fate catches up with Kal-El, and Zod and his pleasant pals find Superman on Earth.  Zod is on a mission to start a new Krypton and will stop at nothing to make this mission come to fruition.  The only thing standing in his way is the boy who fell from the sky in Kansas and an all-out slugfest ensues.<br /><br />***POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING***<br /><br />The results, despite being very loud and destructive, are fairly by-the-book.  At no time in the film did I have any doubt that Superman would stop Zod.  While the battles were taking place, all I could think about were the jumbled, blurry battles of the \\"Transformers\\" films.  I knew that action was taking place, but I really couldn't see it.  The 3-D factor didn't help the situation either.  In fact, if you are reading this review while \\"Man of Steel\\" is still in theaters, save your money and do not watch it in 3-D.  It adds nothing to the film.<br /><br />As many have already alluded to, Superman does quite a few un-Supermanly things.  While I understand the argument that some use for a few of his actions in the film (He was still developing his powers and/or had not realized how much danger those powers would put himself or others in), I also know that from the beginning, even within this film, Kal-El was ingrained with the ideals of protecting humanity at all costs and doing what is right.  I don't even mind the fact that in this film he kills someone.  What bothers me is the fact that he endangers the lives of innocents, which is something Superman ALWAYS tries to avoid.<br /><br />***END POTENTIAL SPOILERS***<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" attempts to make Superman grittier, and for that, I do applaud writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan.  Nolan did a brilliant job with his take on Batman on the big screen, making a grim character even darker.  Goyer has had his ups and downs over the years.  In my opinion he either knocks a story out of the park (\\"Blade\\" and \\"Blade II\\") or fails miserably (\\"Blade: Trinity\\" and \\"Jumper\\").  Somehow he and Nolan managed to make Superman grittier but still dull at the same time with \\"Man of Steel.\\"<br /><br />Of course, having Zack Snyder guide the entire project is hit and miss as well.  I have really enjoyed some of Snyder's work (\\"Watchmen\\") but often find myself shaking my head at his projects like \\"300\\" and \\"Sucker Punch.\\"  He relies very, very heavily on a stylized look for his films.  This worked brilliantly for \\"Watchmen,\\" but the story suffered in \\"300\\" and \\"Sucker Punch.\\"<br /><br />Ironically, Snyder seems to have held back a bit on the style this go 'round, losing a lot of the polish his films usually come with, and amped up the action to near-Michael Bay levels.  This, in my opinion, hurt \\"Man of Steel\\" more than it helped.  For those of you who skipped the \\"spoiler\\" section, know that 3-D adds nothing to the film.<br /><br />I also believe that Snyder's guidance of the actors lead to a few wooden performances.  Henry Cavill is okay as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, but there are moments in the film where he seems to be attempting to channel Christopher Reeve (something I believe Brandon Routh managed to do brilliantly in \\"Superman Returns\\"), that actually hurt his performance.  This isn't Reeve's version of Superman, apparently, so why attempt to bring some of that character to the table?  I also felt that Diane Lane (Martha Kent) delivered a less-than-stellar performance.  I enjoy watching Lane in other films, but something just didn't click with me in her portrayal of Martha.  Ayelet Zurer portrays Lara, Superman's mother, and while her role is quite small in the film, I felt that her performance overall was average at best.<br /><br />Amy Adams was decent as Lois Lane.  When first introduced to her character, Adams brought the fearlessness of Lois to the forefront.  As the film wore on, however, the character seems to lose a step.  Michael Shannon (General Zod) chewed up any and every scene he was in.  His Zod was burly, barking, and one-track minded.  I never could really find any attachment to his character though and in the end, I was glad when his barking stopped.<br /><br />Despite these bumps in the road, there were quite a few bright spots in this film, however.  Kevin Costner nailed his brief turn as Jonathan Kent.  Costner is starting to show his age, and was perfect for the role.  Another bright spot was Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Even though I knew what was going to happen to him, I cheered him on in the beginning of the film.  He seemed genuinely concerned for his people and for his son's life.  He was quite possibly the best performer in the entire film.  One other performance worthy of special mention is that of Antje Traue, who portrayed Zod's right hand man...er..woman, Faora-Ul.  While she didn't have many lines in the film, she was excellent with the few she had.  I actually hope to see her return in the next film, as I felt she was more imposing than Zod.<br /><br />Other performances worth noting are those of Michael Kelly (Lombard), Rebecca Buller (Jenny), Laurence Fishburne (Perry White), and Mackenzie Gray (Jax-Ur).  While all of these actors had small roles, they did solid jobs with them.<br /><br />Overall, I'd have to say that \\"Man of Steel\\" is a mediocre flick.  I went in hoping to see a new spin on an old hero and I got that, but so much of the core character was peeled away that the film ended up somewhat hollow.  I do believe that Henry Cavill has the goods when it comes to portraying Superman, I just believe that a better director and better story would have helped him greatly.  Much like Brandon Routh, he was weighed down by good intentions that eventually killed the film overall.<br /><br />Mildly recommended, as it was nice to see Supes on the big screen again.  Just skip the 3-D.ook for his films.

B0016K40KY|5.0|This is arguably Sir David Lean's greatest work -- a great film among other greats, such as [[ASIN:B00004XPPC The Bridge on the River Kwai]] and [[ASIN:B002WC88A8 Doctor Zhivago]]. Part of Lean's skillfulness as a filmmaker was his ability to bring a story to life no matter what its scale. He excelled not just at large-scale pictures like Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Doctor Zhivago, but made beautifully crafted smaller films, as well -- such as [[ASIN:B0035ECHIG Brief Encounter]], [[ASIN:B001LMU1A0 Hobson's Choice]], and [[ASIN:6305094934 Summertime]].<br /><br />Lean's films are rich in story, character development, and sense of place and time -- as well as visually sumptuous -- and Lawrence of Arabia, especially, excels in all these ways. With the backdrop of the Arabian desert, Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps the most visually striking of all of Lean's films, and the political context in which it takes place, along with the depth and complexity of Lawrence's character, add immeasurably to the richness of the film.<br /><br />While this film is about historical events and real people (including T. S. Lawrence, himself) various questions have been raised about the historical accuracy of the film. For those who are interested in teasing apart what's fact and what's fiction, Wikipedia and other sources offer more details.<br /><br />Obviously, the great scope of historical events and the range of events in an individual's life must be pared down to fit within the context of a film (and even a longer one, such as this). Though people may argue about how appropriately this was accomplished, that this film is a great artistic achievement is beyond question.

B00COGXGNQ|1.0|This movie tries to be Sleeping With The Enemy, but realizes early that it's failing, so it pulls out every cliché in the Nicholas Sparks arsenal to try and rescue the movie.  The characters are poorly developed; the abusive husband is ridiculously unbelievable, everyone but the 6-yr-old daughter is a waste of screen time - and she's a typical 6-yr-old actress.  What a piece of garbage - don't waste 1:55 of your life watching this.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a good read for me. Neil Gaiman writes children very well, very realistically. How they exist separate from adults, with their own worries, pressures, and social circles.<br /><br />The protagonist is an adult man who recalls events from when he was 7. He'd forgotten these events, in part due to magic, but also as a result of simply growing up. There seems to also be a component of not wanting to think about the terror of that time.<br /><br />While this is a book about children, and I'm a believer in letting kids read where their curiosity takes them, this is intended for adults. The scares are big. It's about not being able to always trust adults to listen or understand. There is a hint of physically abuse, most likely because the adult was being controlled, but still a scary thing for a young one to contemplate a parent threatening their life. And there is a witnessed sexual act. While it's not graphic, because it's filtered through the protag's level of understanding at that time, there might be questions.<br /><br />For younger readers who liked Coraline, or \\"Graveyard,\\" this might work as supervised reading. Those books were also scary, and so a younger reader of Gaiman might be prepared for this one. My advice is to know your child, and read the book too! Hey, it's a good book, and not very long!<br /><br />What amazes me about Gaiman -- well, a lot of things to -- is how I can enjoy his books even when he writes about things I'd generally not be into. The origin of the \\"villain\\" is not really my thing, but I still found myself shuddering. (In a good way.)<br /><br />What I loved was the family the protagonist met, and who are at the center of the book. Want a whole book focused on them, their reality.<br /><br />I'm calling this 4 stars because, while no complaints and much to admire, it didn't attain perfection for me. This rating might change with time, when I've lived with the book, and if it continues to stick out in my memory. I know a lot of people are considering it perhaps the acme of a very impressive career, and the best part of the book was how you sensed the autobiographical elements. There's a lot of passages that should resonate with anyone who remembers childhood.<br /><br />Note/mild spoiler: People who are sensitive to the death of animals, I'm one of them, should know one dies early on. It's not rendered in exhaustive detail, the protag doesn't witness it, and there's no indication the animal suffered, but it's there.eople are considering it perhaps the acme of a very impressive career, and the best part of the book was how you sensed the autobiographical elements.

B008HLZUUE|5.0|Some parts seemed to drag a bit, but it was for good reason. Some characters are just more interesting then others, but even the boring characters played an important role in a story so well written and believable that it makes you think their should be a history channel documentary as well as the show that already exists. I will say however this is the first book in the series I have read and would advise reading the first 3 first. I thought that since I had watched the show I would be able to follow along, and I was, but I had to do a lot of googling to fill in some blank spots. Don't make the same mistake, read them all.
B00400NHRO|3.0|I heard/read a lot of positive reviews about this book so I decided to get it.  It's just okay.  Author can be wordy sometimes and he introduces a lot of characters so keeping them all straight can be a bit confusing.  Also, book was written a while ago so a lot of the culture and actions are quite antiquated...or maybe there are still some raunchy residency programs out there, but I highly doubt it.

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|...this album rocks!...another materpiece of this mighty band...Deep Purple back with a powerful album...this album reminds me &#34;Perfect Stranger&#34; but a little bit modern.
B000FC146C|4.0|It was an interesting book as I really know nothing about Australia...descriptions of life there were enlightening...characters were well drawn out.  Interesting too was the tug of war between the lead characters each with his/her own strong feelings.  Had me wondering how it would turn out.
193700788X|5.0|I have read the entire series and I loved the last book as much as I did the first.  Sad that the series is over but very happy with the way it ended!
B00AHRWBH6|5.0|I am enjoying this read.  Very informative book. It gives a little exercise to do in each section to apply what you've read.
B006GSRFOY|4.0|Thin Lizzy parted ways with Eric Bell following the release of their third record Vagabonds of the Western World. It was Lizzy's first great album and can today be considered a minor rock classic. But it's disappointing chart showing and disillusionment with the band overall lead to Bell leaving and for Brian Downey and Phil Lynott to carry on. Finding American born guitarist Scott Gorham and Scottish player Brian \\"Robbo\\" Robertson. This of course would etch the band in their \\"classic\\" line up and help define one of the most important, unique and influential hard rock bands ever. But it took them a bit to get there. They recorded 1974's Nightlife. The band didn't exactly find that patent Lizzy twin guitar attack or their tough heavy sound right away. Opening up with She Knows, it's a great soft rocker. With a nice acoustic riff topped off with hints of electric lead lines here and there. It's one of the bands more underrated numbers but it does appear on some compilations. Lizzy was always a band that balanced their brand of hard rock with some great soft songs. Lynott was a master of emotionally resonant sincere rock songs with a message.  Despite the fact they were great for these styles of songs, the nature of them was always rooted in rock. But here the band really goes for that overall soft rock approach. The title track, is a slow bluesy \\"light rocker\\" with a nice groove but it even has some strings on it. It's bouncy and fun but it really shows the band in a different mood here.<br /><br />They kick back with the killer It's Only Money. A cool tough rocker, with a great dirty guitar tone, and some cool in the mix cowbell. The drum sound is also real punchy here. But oddly it's one of the only tracks here that has the in your face style of familiar Thin Lizzy. Still In Love With You finds the band in power ballad mode here. Most fans know this Lizzy classic from it's cooking version off Live & Dangerous but here in it's more sterile studio version it also works, especially taken in context with the rest of the material here. It should be noted this original version contains joint vocal work with Scottish singer/songwriter Frankie Miller. Frankie Carroll sounds like Lynott's tribute to Dylan of some kind. Another gentle piano driven song, it's ok, the piano melody isn't that great and it's an interesting musical idea but it needed something else. This leads into Banshee. It finds some beautiful interwoven acoustic and electric guitar lines. It's a gorgeous but much too brief piece that for the first times finds Robertson and Gorham locking together for something special. The newly released deluxe edition of Nightlife actually has a longer (just under 2:30) take of it for the BBC. This is the version you should most likely play when listening to this record as this is a simple but still very pretty piece that really deserved some more time on the record. Philomena is a more uptempo light rocker. We see the electric guitars come back to the forefront, it's a decent song but the main riff could be better. Sha La La finally shows the kick ass Thin Lizzy. Of course this track was on Live & Dangerous as well, and there is truly ignites into an absolutely killer rocker. Here it still manages some good momentum. Of course to analyze the song apart from it's more famous live counterpart, the lyrics to this song are ridiculous and mean nothing, but its the music that just blows the walls down. The song also features double bass drums as it's main rhythm which was extremely rare at the time and shows Downey's growing prowess as one of rocks best drummers.<br /><br />The record closes one another slow note, Dear Heart. With a mix of pianos, keyboards and light guitars, it shows a good, delicate atmosphere that was as always, one of Phil's strong suits. Nightlife wasn't a hit record, and it must've been the final kick in the ass for Lynott to abandon the more exploratory nature of his songwriting and unleash the inner rocker. This iswithout a doubt the biggest anomaly in the bands catalog. We had seen Lynott do an album of almost all laid back folky material with their 2nd album Shades of a Blue Orphanage but that was with Eric Bell in the bands \\"serious\\" phase. After acquiring 2 hot guitarists, it makes one wonder what he was thinking during the writing of this. Perhaps after the lack of success with what was sure to be the bands breakthrough in Vagabonds, he decided to cling to the more laid back \\"soft\\" nature of this. The Eagles were pretty big at the time so perhaps that was the intention. There are some great musical ideas here and the album overall is still pretty good, and has less filler than their more popular \\"slump\\" album Renegade. It just doesn't have a large share of heavy rock the band is known for. That would come a year later with Fighting, almost re-birthing them in a way. Still, check out Nightlife, it doesn't necessarily rock but its got some very good music on it still, once more proving that even with Phillip Lynott was at his weakest, he still made sure a good record came out of it somewhere.

158270208X|1.0|Buy a tablet at the store and write in it for 99 cents. What a waste of money. NOT a book. This is a Tablet. Do Not Recommend buying this TABLET.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|Did someone say; dry, dull, boring, offensive. I loved these actors all playing different roles in too many movies to count.  Dialogue in Breakfast at Tiffany's yes, Glen Gary Ross....sadly I didn't even finish it.
1582701709|5.0|I love this book. Very much a mood elevator. Great for a Positive Mental Attitude!!!  We all know how important PMA is.  I can't say enough about how great this book is.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This could really use some demo for beginners. When I first started I had no idea what to do,  so I just started tapping the screen randomly ; and that pretty much you're suppose to do!  lol You tap the objects in the room to see if they are possible clues to help you escape. Some of the codes you have to figure out absolutely ridiculous! No &quot;normal&quot; human being would automatically be able to decipher some this stuff,  so I guess I'm not so &quot;normal&quot; because I was able to figure some of out,  that really shouldn't make sense to anyone! And I got really stump I just went to old faithful... Youtube! There actually are walkthroughs on YouTube that will show u how to get through the levels. Oh if you get stuck on level 7,  you should know that the colors blocks on the floor in the second room is the key to opening the chest in the first room. If you decide to use the Youtube walk through, know that code the video maker uses may be different from yours. If so,  just put in the colors as you see them laid out in the second room, but every time you see the foursquared wooden box, put in the color black : wooden box = black. All in all pretty ok game,  really makes you use  your noggin Lol.
B004U52VPS|2.0|The game makes no sense.  I disposed of this. Cheap and crappy and the kids thought it was stupid and junk
B008220DGE|4.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  The character that Paul Seymour Hoffman plays is kind of a guru with his own agenda to get people well and focused.  The acting by the entire main cast was fantastic.  The only reason I knocked a star off of this is that it paces a little slow in places. Otherwise I enjoyed it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It was so realistic. I was especially impressed that the terrorists could be seen empathetically. It showed how complicated the whole idea of terrorism can be. The female protagonist was absolutely amazing!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The great love story continues, what a beautiful story. Gideon and Eva are Great together.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. At first I didn't exactly want to read a cancer book, but I can assure this is nothing like any other one I have read. Thank you, John Green for letting the awesomeness that is The Fault in Our Stars be a part of this world. By writing this the world suck has gone down tremendously.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm a big scifi/fantasy fan, and I have to say this is one of my favorite books from this genre.

You will have no problem getting through this book, and I recommend it to anyone of any age!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The cast and plot never fail to make me laugh. Always an enjoyable time watching Big Bang Theory. Great season!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love this movie. Not only did it focus on the main characters of all previous marvel movies but it also introduced two new characters such as Hawkeye and Black Widow. It was funny and action packed. It was appropriate for all ages. My 10 year old loved it and so did my wife who isn't into comic books. I would recommend everyone to watch it.

B007ZXK08C|1.0|I though this was a really stupid book.  It made no sense to me and it took me ages to get through it.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I found this book very hard to get through until the shipwreck.  I thought the author gave way too much history.  Details that the reader really didn't need to know.  But I got through it and I liked it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|OK, I have to admit, I couldn't wait to get the 3rd book that I read the first 2 just to keep myself busy, but this is ridiculous! No happy at all with how it ended, plus it seemed like she was pushing just to get the book out. Everyone was still in the \\"50 Shades\\" craze, but this? I can't believe I waited all this time.<br />EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!
