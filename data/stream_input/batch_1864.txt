B006O6F932|2.0|The set folds out to a nice size but that is expected if you look at the size of the dolls.<br /><br />Construction is flimsy. I expect a bit more than a tiny hand hook to hold sides together in the middle. Would have been better if walls could actually \\"click\\" into each other.<br /><br />It is not difficult to put together but the instructions are very limited. No instructions included for some seats, the stickers etc. An average person can easily figure it out but why not just include full instructions at this price.  Instructions and the playset picture on the box does not  match up 100%.<br /><br />Our biggest disappointment though is the clock. On the pics it looks like it has a nice rounded purple frame. In reality it is black with two white points sticking out conspicuously. The points are for folding up the set (so necessary) but it looks like there is a cover missing because the white stands out so obviously against the dark colors of the set.  First presumed we are missing a little cover but I guess that is just the way it is made (more cheap looking than the picture on the box indicates).<br /><br />In general a cute set but not as nice as expected. It gives a feeling of economic corners cut after the model was made and photographed.<br /><br />My little girl is very excited about the set so we are probably keeping if I had assembled it before giving it to her, I would have returned it.

B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Bought this movie in HD and had trouble getting it to play. Called Amazon support, spent over 1 hour before it was passed onto another group which was to have a resolution in 2 to 3 days. That was 9 days ago and I was told after my checking on it, that they were working on it. I was given a $3 credit for my trouble, paid $4.99 for the rental which I can't watch.

B000VHMF0A|5.0|By far Bob Marley is one of my favorite musicians of all time. His words stir thoughts and emotions that resonate deep. If you haven't had a chance buy this and watch Marley. You wont be disappointed.

B008J9EYFG|5.0|After the sub-par Comfort of Strangers, Beth is back with her new album.  Her offbeat voice is perfect for the songs on this album and it's great that she is staying with her passion after having a baby.
B0016CJNS6|5.0|great music.  totally enjoy the album.  ordered and received this item in excellant time.  completely pleased with the purchasing process...
B0035KGWR2|4.0|Some have wrote this album isn't very good.  I disagree, I like a number of songs on it.  If one wants to listen to pub music, the first album has good songs to listen to over a pint.  This album is the next step forward.  It's not boring, nor overly self indulgent, it's just a step up to the next level of her growth as an artist.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|great music.  totally enjoy the album.  ordered and received this item in excellant time.  completely pleased with the purchasing process...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this free app because of my little sister, who watches this show. She plays and watches me play this app for hours. Definitely for a pony lover!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Can one man's unresolved past really lead him to walk over 600 miles to be with someone whom he befriended long ago?  Amazing story of strength and resolution
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very great app. help a lot when I need to check my battery power levels. it also helps with managing my battery usage. very helpful.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|This book is one of the worst I have read.  I simply could not figure out what the author was trying to accomplish. Very hard to follow.
1419705849|5.0|This was a gift for my 10 year old grandson and he finished reading it in less than 2 days.  So I think it was a great success.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent reading. It takes a while to get through, but well worth the read. The HBO series was good, too!!
0312945973|4.0|this wa s  a replacement purchased because my grandson lost my original<br />I enjoyed the book so much I loaned to him<br />the condition of the book was not a s good as other used that I had purchased but  I kept it any  to loan to some one else
B009MCRHH6|3.0|This has got to be the best-designed app I've ever used. Even better than big names such as Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. The graphics run SO SMOOTHLY. Better than any app I've ever used. The game is also very beautiful and has great music and sound effects.<br /><br />Where I run into issues is the actual gameplay. The game just does not entice me very much. I like the idea of building structures in order to overcome obstacles, but the actual pieces you build with are just too shaky and unstable. I understand that that is part of the challenge of the game, but it's just that if the objective is to build a path from point A to point B, I should be able to do that, provided I have the know-how and I've figured out whatever secret there is to overcome. The problem in this game that there is for me is that I can understand how to beat a level, it's just too unstable to complete it. Maybe that's just me though. Worth a shot!
B008NB0SQO|3.0|I grew up with the VHS version since I was a child and now that I purchased the new release, I am extremely disappointed that the \\"When Love is Gone\\" scene was cut out of the film.  I chime in with everyone else asking Disney to re-release this again with at least the option to view the 'extended-cut'.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game but my main issue is that I purchase the coin doubler and there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to tell that it is working. It disappears completely and the coins don't seem to be doubling. So something like at the end of the victory screen that say coins x2 would be nice.
B009SQRL4U|2.0|Arthur Christmas was surprisingly unpleasant with an uninteresting array of dislikeable characters meandering about a confused Freudian plot.  Skip this holiday atrocity and check out Rise of the Guardians.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is an awesome app! My younger sister has it on her iPod and now I can play it on my kindle fire.one thing I would change about it is the price.I would bring it to about .99,but other than that its awesome!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Great movie, the actors did a great job. Daniel Craig, Harrisson Ford and the rest of the cast. I recommend seeing this movie. Exciting. J. & G. Merrill
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A one timer That is pretty funny over all that had lots of funny scenes and OK story line ok
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Ron Howard did great a Directing this movie, along with Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly work well together. Very nice looking actors too. Great acting and would add this to a classic movie. Definitely recommend seeing this movie. Great Movie! J. & G. Merrill
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I always forget to see what the free app is so I was happy I checked. If you like strategic building games you will have a hard time putting this down.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This is a great movie! Love Harrisson Ford and his character in the series is perfect. I recommend seeing this movie. Exciting. J.& G. Merrill
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good game, it is so much fun and I can play it on my kindle fire. You should really try this game
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I have loved reading this series<br /><br />It is so powerful and moving<br />It is a must read<br />Such a wonderful ending too!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is a holiday classic and the DVD transfer is great.  I noticed that they took out the song of when Scrooge breaks up with his girlfriend, but that wasn't really memorable at all and I like it better this way.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Had never read any of the series, but the movie preview looked good. I am digging the book. try it out.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|A pitch above &#34;Glee&#34;.  Gentle, possible for minors, far from explosive, not a pinch of harm for anyone.  Good clean fun.
075669812X|5.0|Lots of cool pictures . My grandsons are all fans of the tv series and toys. This book helps grandpa keep up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this and the movie. Can't wait to see Catching Fire. Latinas is a strong female character. I recommend this to anyone.
B002B55XGI|5.0|It was a gift and my son loved it!  It was delivered fast.  It was used but in GREAT shape!  He would never know.
B0086700CM|5.0|Run run as fast as you can get those coins and avoid the monkeys, fire, trees and holes. Great time sink.
B0076DELIG|5.0|jsut another great book. Had to read it all at once. Keep it up. Thanks for great writing interesting characters
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is okay --- I guess I have played some more exciting games --- but this will do when I want something quiet to do
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I have seen this movie on the big screen and loved it Wife, and my daughter's family wanted to see a good movie and Amazon TV had it and we watched it together.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game --- very relaxing --- keeps you watching and remembering where tiles are --- I love this game
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is classic Grisham.  Reading it, one cannot help but imagine the solution, and unfurl the plot.  Like most of his novels, it's impossible to foresee the end from anywhere inside the book.<br /><br />Captivates, entertains, and leaves you waiting for the next one!!
B0085A9HXS|4.0|Purchased the Bluray without having seen the movie. From the beginning The Raid's plot lacks any type of substance, with only enough to keep you going from point A to B. Its apparent this movie was made solely for the absolutely amazing hand-to-hand fight scenes. Wonderfully choreographed and visceral, the fights never get old.<br /><br />Unfortunately you do have to drudge through all but forty minutes before the first non-gun fight scene happens. As expected in a dubbed movie the voice acting is just awful, but aside from that the audio is awesome. Every crack of gun fire, snap of bone, and slash of knife if perfectly clear and pulls you right in.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with my purchase. This is a great popcorn &#34;kung fu&#34; movie aside from the terrible voice dubbing and vapid plot.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|The contrast that Tim Burton contributed to the already imaginative wonder of this Disney classic, enhances the same qualities that made this movie such a good film in its original format.  Alice in wonderland is as complex or simple as the viewer cares to enjoy, and Mr. Burton's edition of cast choices and contrast thru set and color schemes enhances that very quality, making that appreciable quality even more accessible to a wider range of viewers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like it first of all because it is a John Grisham novel and I have enjoyed reading all of his novels.<br /><br />This one is not his usual lawyer on the case story - it is more of a mystery with lot's of twists and turns. I like this new Grisham still.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works great! The wireless range is good, sound quality is fantastic.<br /><br />The only thing that's annoying actually relates to windows, which is having to switch back and forth between multiple audio outputs.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|It is a heck of a lot easier on the computer. They practically rig it so some of the levels are close to almost impossible. But it is a joyful game most of the time  because it challenges you.
B004WJREMW|1.0|I am a big McCartney, Wings and Beatles fan, but based upon the quality of the songs and the lyrics it must of took Paul all of three days to write and record these songs.  This album is sure to disappoint all but the most zealous fans.  It might disapponit some of them too.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|i would say if you have the avengers you must get this one, the movie itself is a little dark though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book I've read it seven times<br />I recommend it to anyone who can read well<br />Hope you like the book
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|fun read and well written.  I just finished the Shades of Gray and this is much better written even though they are very different
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I loved learning about every thing the dictionary .<br />Everyone should learn what the dictionary has provided for every single one of us
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not well written as it is at a six grade reading level.  I liked the story and enjoyed the sex but it got old after a while.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|as to be expected  loved it and it was well worth the wait. and I can't wait until the next installment
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|boring and pointless, in this day and age viewers aren't all that impressed with violence porn.  the characters were shallow deuche bags, and the plot fell flat.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|It's hard for me to figure out the specific thing that makes this movie  5-star.  I think it's the aggregation of the story, the acting, the setting (Hawaii) and the music.  Everything is appropriate.  Nothing is over the top,  it all works together for a fantastic viewing experience.  We will watch this movie over and over.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the best apps I got for my kindle fire hd it tells me how much memory space I have plus battery life I have left  and it even tells me how much data went to apps,games,books,etc. If you are looking for an app that's easy to read and helps you keep track of your kindle fire or droid phone then this is the app for you!<br /><br />  From Chad
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|One of the things that made The Descendants such an outstanding movie was the music, thoughtfully selected by the film's producer.  There is a lot of &#34;tourist&#34; Hawaiian music.  You hear it often.  The real Hawaiian music is on this CD.  Lots of Gabby Pahinui, a true icon of Hawaiian music.
B008MX7Z32|5.0|This product is wonderful. It provides more than enough illumination (the highest brightness level is too much for my application). I like that it folds into such a compact package and it seems to be built well. I might have liked if it's base was a slight bit heavier but then I would probably be complaining about it being too heavy. I've remedied that matter by just setting something else on the base if I need additional counterbalance.<br /><br />I highly recommend this lamp.
1455519006|4.0|I have read everything that David Baldacci has written and enjoyed all of them - some more than others.  This was a very good book about Will Robie, a professional assassin who is employed by one of our Federal agencies.  This fact alone gave me pause as I would like to think that such individuals don't exist but know in my heart that they most likely do.  Robie, however, is an assassin with a heart.  His most recent assignment involved killing a mother and her young son which he was unable to do (the first innocents).  Shortly thereafter he met Julie Getty whose parents were just murdered (the second innocent).  The entire book involves Robie and Julie being chased by villains trying to first scare them and finally trying to kill them.  This book has a little of everything:  car chases, shootouts, bombings, moles, attempted assassinations, treason and everything in between.  My only complaint is that the two plots, which were really unrelated, were just barely tied up at the conclusion.  The characters were very well developed and likable which is typical of David Baldacci's books and the action never lagged.  I'm happy that I read it and recommend it to others who are fans of a good action book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|What can I say, damn I have payed full price on several devices, It's nice to see it as an free app of the day, the game play is great, and the soundtrack, wow that alone is worth the five dollars itself, definitely recommend this to anybody, my kids and wife are hooked on it, did I mention the soundtrack, get it now before the price goes back up
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Finally!  If you love the greatest Saturday afternoon adventure films ever made, buy this without thinking twice.  Yes, you do have to put up with owning the Crystal Skull, but imagine having the opening scenes of Temple of Doom on blu-ray, among countless other fast-paced wonders.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this game is an excellent starter game, how ever when you play this one for a while, you will end up not running out of coins and be able to continue for hours on end without having to wait for a recharge. It's a nice time killer. Thanks for the app.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read this for my book group.  The end was something I didn't see coming AT ALL.  Interesting way to develop character.  Did they really KNOW who did it I wonder?
B005LAIHZY|4.0|The kids enjoyed it, but at times the action seemed a little slow. I would still recommend it though it's a cute movie.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|It was great!  I never had a Rod Stewart CD, but this one was exceptional.  What a class act and some very entertaining Christmas music.  I am impressed.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Doodle jump is an awesome game. I'm just now Bering it on my kindle; but I play it on my brothers Ipad all the time. Its so cool.
0743270754|5.0|The depth of knowledge and understanding, and the conveyance of it, can not be matched or more appreciated.  A big thank you to the author for her efforts and the sharing of her gifts!  Hunker down with this book and take in the extraordinary lives and times!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Anyone who likes, loves or enjoys alternative history movies should give this a try. I've heard from some that the book was better but not having read it I can only tell you what I enjoyed about the movie.<br /><br />Anyone who does not like deviations from the correct version of history will hate it because they did make some obvious adjustments that could not be true. But the movie was really fun to watch and I found myself cheering for Abe towards the end.<br /><br />As this movie is not meant to be a serious historical drama you have to go into it with the mindset that you are there to watch a fun, exciting movie that will at times make you laugh.<br /><br />Visually, the movie looked really cool. Some of the CG could have been improved but nothing that takes away from the overall quality of the movie.<br /><br />The cast was great and did a great job in character capturing the emotion of the scenes.<br /><br />Anyone who is thinking about seeing it should give it a try. Go in with an open mind and think of it as a twist on history. This movie may well surprise you.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|We bought this for my son's 11th birthday. He is a BIG Lego fan. Although the box said \\"16+\\" he finished it in 2 days (approximately 12hrs) ALL BY HIMSELF.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story is told in a fascinating way.  The characters are developed so thoroughly it's as though we know them.  And the twist in the story, while surprising, is totally believable and understandable.
0156027321|5.0|The condition was described quite acurately. It was in new condition at used prices. i loved it. It was a gift. I had put the wrong mailing address and emailed the seller they fixed it for me immediatly! I'm so pleased! I would buy from the seller over and over again! I was so pleased it came on Christmas Eve so I could wrap it and give the gift!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like the Walking Dead. I did not think I would like a zombie movie but I do. The actors are great.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. it is extremely addicting, and is one of the best games in the app store. all of the different blades make it very fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very exciting! I would recommend this book to teenagers especially girls. Probably, this is the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|star wars and angry birds- the 2 best things in the world are combined!!! this game is so addicting, and I love how the birds swing lightsabers or use the force.  this game is completely worth 3 dollars!!!
0345803493|5.0|I would order again..<br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
1455519006|5.0|David Baldacci continues to be my favorite author.  I try to read all of his books and have read most of them.  After reading this book, I purchased it for my mother-in-law for Christmas.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The songs are cut down from the musical versions, but it is still fantastic! and you can't beat the price!!!
B006UKC566|5.0|In my opinion this is a great movie.  The 3D is mind blowing and the action is just amazing. If you are a fan of 300 or the Spartacus series then you will enjoy this.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Thought the movie was really funny. Ted sounded a lot like Peter Griffin from Family Guy, but they made a reference to that in the movie so it was acceptable. Funny movie. Worth the watch!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Just clicking to see what friends and family face for their day is comforting.<br />Very easy to set up and use.
B00797MB0O|3.0|The characters were great and Charlize is riveting.  Patton Oswalt is also a surprisingly good actor!  I had always thought he was a stand up comedian.  These two were wonderful actors and had very interesting characters.<br /><br />That said, I didn't understand the \\"plot.\\"  Maybe it just went over my head.  I watched this movie, but I don't know what it is about and I didn't get the ending.  But for whatever reason, I feel like I liked it.  So my point is, keep an open mind!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What's not to like? It's the Beatles! 6-year old daughter loves the Beatles! CD was not scratched, although it was not cellophaned.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|One of my favourite Harry Bosch stories. I was in LA during the quake. It brings back memories. Glad Harry found a little happiness and some resolution. Haven't  read this book in years. Glad I did.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This box set is great! It has so much information about the history of the real family. And the music box is beautiful!! LOVE IT!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Love Clint Eastwood. What could be better than baseball and Eastwood?  Nice heartwarming movie. Fairly predictable but good enough to be ok with that.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This story moves at a crisp pace from the opening scenes. The scientific and engineering details, far from boring, are an integral part of the story. The central characters resourcefulness, and humor in an impossible situation give this story a &#34;MacGyver&#34; in space feel.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I have already seen this show so I knew I would enjoy it. The boxed set is more than I could have wanted and it was in brand-new condition so I have no complaints.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the most amazing true story that I have ever read.  The author and his buddies were so brave and gave everything for their country.  The pain and suffering they went through was more than I thought was possible.  I read the book in one day.
B001AEF6CW|1.0|Being the only thing my son asked for this year, he was so excited on Christmas morning when he unwrapped it.  When he removed it from the packaging, the display bowling ball was broken.  He was extremely disappointed.  To make matters worse, the return policy for this product is refund only so I am going to have to send it back and then reorder.  Do not order this product from Amazon.  Find it someplace else where greater care is taken with product shipping and the return policy is better.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|Robert Downey  was great again this one is better than the first.<br />Jude Law and Mr. Downey work great together
B008G12ERC|5.0|If you are a Muse fan, you will enjoy this CD. If you are not a Muse fan, you will soon become one.  Outstanding guitar licks, incredible vocals!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this app. It keeps me busy and keeps me entertained all the time. Well made. I love the options too for backgrounds
B009NOVCTM|4.0|If you ever wanted a greatest hits set of the Rolling Stones and new material to boot, this is for you!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another wonderful book couldn't stop reading. Can't wait till the next one comes out.  Eager and waiting patiently for the third.....
B0009MAO46|5.0|Great price, especially considering I couldn't even find the original toy story movie anywhere else online. And to top that its a 10 anniversary edition.. Delivered fast and works great :)
B001CDD84Y|3.0|It was a good action film, and at the end it leaves itself open for Jumper 2. Acting lacked, but overall still a decent flick.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|please tell Mr DeMille that this is one of his best john corey books.  I am so sorry I finished it because what could follow it up?<br /><br />I loved Plum Island and this is it's equal.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is addicting so don't start playing it if you have something else you should be doing. I love the animation and all the options it gives you.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|It was everything I expected, loved it from the first season to the second! Can't wait for the 3rd season.<br />The dvd's came in a matter of days!
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|Smart wit, enjoyable and laughable humor. Good stuff from the cast - hysterical moments and funny story line. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book that really impacted me. Worth reading and is definitely one of the most clever and interesting books I have read
B009329ZF2|3.0|So - 3 stars for guessing who the weak link is in this movie. Really great action in the story line - but just ok acting - really by just one actor/actress. Again - you get to guess who it is who is somewhat weak. But - still enjoyed the movie. One must be willing to give extra credit to someone who is a &#34;first&#34; in acting during this film, but otherwise, enjoyable.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|GOOD IDEA<br />TO HAVE THE DICTIONARY SO . PEOPLE CAN FIND WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY . NEED IT!<br />COOL!!!!!!!!
B004G600A4|5.0|I so love it that there is a HEROINE in this fab movie. I LOVE hero's - but also love it when Hollywood produces a HEROINE to enjoy as well. Great story line - funny stuff - and great voice overs. Lots of laughable moments for the entire family to enjoy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|wow! thank you, amazon, for the awesome x-mas present! this is a great FAOTD but it is worth the $5 it normally costs. other reviewers have described this game in detail so i won't try. i will say that this game is a lot more fun than other games like it, such as &quot;where's my water&quot;. i get bored with games like that &amp; physics puzzlers in general pretty fast, but thus one is very addictive. i like that you have to pretty much figure out the goal if each level on your own, with some essential hints from the sign painter. it's fun to keep trying and trying so it doesn't really get frustrating, but if you're really stuck you can skip a level. while trying to achieve the goal you get audio feedback from the gooballs, who talk (their own language) which is helpful and encouraging. and really, goo is always fun and cool so it's hard to get bored by it. i don't know how much replay value this game will have, but it has enough levels to provide for many hours of entertainment. merry x-mas! thank you amazon for really giving us a gift today. yay.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I am completely flaked out on Dexter!  Not only is he sooo simpatico but all the seconday actors are really really good.  I keep hoping non of the ones I like best will day.  As far as television series go, this has to be the most original one in many a year.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is my third review of Rodriguez CDs. I bought the 3 at the same time, and am very glad that I did. A huge talent who is sadly near the end of his career due to health issues. A must listen and a must-have.
B000EUDAWG|2.0|I bought this for a prankster friend. We discovered that it does not work on carpet (we're talking no pile carpet). Very disappointing!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|It is such a shame that Rodriguez did not catch on in the 60s. The material es excellent, and the performance is outstanding. Too important a talent to continue to be ignored. Listen to him!

B009NPKTN6|1.0|Horrible!  Misogynistic!  Terrible, terrible writing, god-awful acting except for Tom Cruise.  He was wonderful.  A delight to watch and to hear sing.  He's the only one worth seeing in this movie.  The absolute worst.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Once I got the gist of the concept of the show, each episode got funnier. Looked forward to next viewing seasons.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Ms. Boyle's voice is divine.  The beauty and depth of her magnificent voice bring me to tears on several tracks.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|We watch this over and over again. If fantasy is your thing and you need to get lost into a good story, this is for you. Going to buy the 3 D version soon.
B000088E6D|5.0|Buble has a great voice and the songs he sings and the style he follows put in the mind of the great Frank Sinatra.  Good job Michael.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  Depp shows his comedic again and carries it even thru the love scene. Couldn't stop laughing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a lot of fun very thought provoking. the only down side is how much the hints cost but overall a very good game.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I enjoyed all the previous HP movies. This was bit darker than the rest, but most enjoyable non the less.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is extremely useful if you want to get up early because it has so many different settings you can use like the snooze time and the ring tone. my personnel ring tone I like is the rostter because of how load it is and also how funny it is to wake up to an alarm clock that sounds lime a turkey. Anouther thing about the ring tone setting is you can put your own personal favorite music for yurt ring tone. like when I don't have the rostter ring tone one I use my faveorite band munfird and son if you do not know them you should look them up on yutube or the music store. The way you can put your own music is in advanced settings. (SORRY THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TP SPELL) I hope this help it is very good app for free. I forgot to mention that I would regimend wearing headphones because how guite the sound is and also when you pick how to dismiss it do not pick shake it does not work then tu have to deinstall then reinstall.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|The story line is great... I took a star away only because of the gore factor. A bit too much for my taste.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this version does not even have signs yet and probly the suckyest nether ever all it is is a room with pigman in it they will not be able to have a lot of updates because they do not want to take up all of your gb
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Was good as a once over, but not really holding my interest.  Interesting in places, but story was a bit boring.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I play through a couple of these puzzles every day. I find the color version to be easier than the original, but just as fun.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|For the first time in a while I felt the walls crumble. So many feelings and so much angst rapped up into a single book. Read it.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Two of my favorite actors with a nice story line twist. Both are worth their weight in gold for keeping me amused.
0321885112|5.0|As an academic, I have always excelled at notetaking, however Mike Rohde's Sketchnote Handbook has inspired me to take my notes to new heights.  Mike provides an excellent explanation of the sketchnoting process and breaks it into essential steps that are easy to follow for even novices, like me.  The layout and design of the book is also unique as he incorporates his own handrawn sketchnotes throughout, along with examples from other sketchnoters that show how personal the process can be.  The tone is very encouraging, with practice exercises scattered throughout that have me believing that I can create sketchnotes, too and so can you!
B006TTC57C|5.0|My grandaughter loved it. It was worth watching over and over again! Shipped fast too!  Was happy not to have to wait in long lines!

B0053O89WY|5.0|This is my husband's very favorite sitcom.  He has wanted to buy it but didn't want to pay the average price of $40 at the movie stores.  When I found it for half that price on Amazon I scooped it up.  He was thrilled!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a great addition to your collection if you like puzzle games. It's simple enough for a kid to play but tough enough for an adult.<br /><br />The premise of the game is simple enough. All you have to do is connect each pair of colored dots. However, don't be fooled by the simplicity. You must use all the squares in the grid and you cannot cross any lines.<br /><br />Happy puzzle solving!!!
1439110123|4.0|Ok so I am fed up With the best seller list, so now I read to educate myself. This book gave a very good history of the world according to the oil industry. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and I developed a different understanding of the oil market and how it impacts foreign policy.

B004ZNA7WY|4.0|I heard this album many years ago so when I saw it, I decided to buy.  It is just as good as when I heard previously.<br />It is usual PF so no surprises....
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book is well written.  It brings you right in to the events with the view point of the characters in the story and what they are experiencing.  Its a easy read that keeps a person interested throughout the whole book.
B000002IQ9|3.0|Has most of his hits and is enjoyable to hear.  I appear to be going back to older music lately so this fit right in with what I am doing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I literally just read this entire book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. captivating and moving in a strangely brilliant way. so worth reading.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I have no complaints about Phil Collins, he's a awesome musician with an awesome compilation CD.<br /><br />I literally have no negative things to say about it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Solid story,but there were times Katniss went from being a strong, independent protagonist to a baby hiding her face in someone's chest. Moments like that just seemed so out of character. Also her unawareness of where her romantic feelings lie begins to seem weak the farther the book progresses. There wasn't near enough scenes to explain the dynamic of her relationship with Gale. Did she have a solid crush on him? Perhaps, but it seems that her growing feelings for peeta should have overpowered that, and the end in only made this love triangle even more awkward, and not in a good way. However, katniss' struggle in the games was excellent. By far the strongest part of the book. Would recommend!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely perfect. I've fallen in love with this story. It made me think about everything in my own life. I fell in love with Gus.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is what you expect. It is a standard dictionary and for some reason I am required to review it.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is a fun game you walk around and collect coins. you go to a pony store and buy item's. you do not use real money.
B000LV6REG|4.0|For Led Zeppelin fans, and even fans of Robert Plant's rhythms, this album will be a tremendous disappointment. For music listeners who appreciate their artists aging and their musical output growing in kind, then this just might be a very good album. I truly adore the ballads while dislike most of the harder rocking tunes (which is not unlike my views of his works throughout his solo repertoire.)<br /><br />To me, the song selection is a nice representation of Robert's blues background and certainly reflects his growing heart toward spirituality and humanity. Sadly, his voice falters mightily on this album. But, his renditions of such classics as DARKNESS DARKNESS and MORNING DEW are heartfelt and truly beautiful. His version of HEY JOE seems trite and even a bit out of place, considering the lack of humanity within the songs subject when compared to so many others recorded from PRINCIPLES OF MOMENTS, FATE OF NATIONS and even NOW AND ZEN.<br /><br />After listening to this set... it is easy to understand Robert's later admonition of no longer being a fan of \\"heavy metal\\" (of which thousands of arrested adolescent fans of Led Zeppeling irrationally screached and squalled.) In short, this is not your Robert Plant of yesteryear... the man is growing older and in this collection it shows, both positively and negatively.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice collection piece but not a necessity.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|THE EXTRA BENEFIT OF THE FRANCO ZEFFERELLI VERSION OF 'LA TRAVIATA' INVOLVES THE DIRECTOR'S UNIQUE INSIGHTS IN THE USE OF LIGHTING. WHO COULD DISAGREE THAT THIS IS ALREADY A GREAT OPERA, YET ZEFFERELLI FURTHER ENRICHENS IT, IN PARTICULAR, BY ADDING VISUAL WARMTH TO MANY SCENES... AND AS A COUNTERPOINT, GIVING A VISUAL COMPONENT TO THE SOMBER NATURE OF OTHER SCENES, AS APPROPRIATE.<br /><br />THE QUALITY OF THE LIGHTING RISES TO THE QUALITY OF THE MUSIC, THE VOICES, THE STAGING AND THE LIBRETTO !
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this is the best strategy game I've played on a while I can see why it's a 5 star app if you spend your buck on it then you've got a great game that you can play many times and still different each time you play GET IT PEOPLE!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I'm sad there won't be any more of them after the third one. Some of my favorite movies. I can't say enough!
B00991TCOG|1.0|Tired and unimaginative dubstep productions with noodly violin parts slapped on top.  The whole CD sounds the same.  Lots of riffs but not a memorable melody in the whole thing.  The few vocal parts sound like Madonna back-up vox.  Utter trash.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What could be better than Pinterest... the Pinterest mobile app of course! i.love.this.app! The most recent updates have improved the speed and consistency of the app. Afterall, its no fun if you can't 'repin' when you want. Great app.
B000005RU2|5.0|This is a great CD for the Deep Purple fan . Also had this in the album form when I was a kid.  Used to listen to it for hours.  Definately worth buying in my opinion.  Couldn't find it in the stores, so I checked Amazon and of course, there it was.  I must say this is their best album in my opinion, and yes, the live tracks are better than the studio version.  Highway Star is absolutely awesome!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Books 10 stars, but they ruined this movie. Rewrote the whole blanking thing. If you read the book, forget watching this movie. The pain of what they did to it was too much to bare. I waited till Xmas special $8 HD to see if it was as bad as I remember in theater.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|a feast for the eyes truly. i heart they're coming up with a sequel which i hope pushes through. i want snow white's relationship with the huntsman explored.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is not as well written as Lone Survivor, though it still details the life of a Navy Sea very well.  The true value of this book is the entire unveiling of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden, in a vulgar and explicit manner.  It's book bleeds red, white, and blue.
B00797MB0O|2.0|First the good: The performances in this movie, by and large, were well done. It's practically a given that Charlize Theron did a great job, and Patton Oswald, while not particularly believable at times, ably filled his role. I would have liked to see more of Collette Wolfe, who had a tiny performance as the sister of Patton Oswald's character, but pulled off the subtle comedic nuances that otherwise wouldn't have come through in the dialogue.<br /><br />Also, as far as the story arc and narrative goes, it turns in ways that are often unexpected.<br /><br />Now, the bad: If you are a big fan of dark comedies, this may be your kettle of fish. Personally, I think it's incredibly difficult to pull one off well. Most of the time, they are not deeply thoughtful or unique, but as formulaic as the films they seem written to criticize--simply taking a dark left turn when most other movies would turn right. This movie falls squarely into that latter camp.<br /><br />Rather than having a narrative or a character arc, Theron's Mavis careens from one train wreck to the next. [sort of spoiler] While the ending is surprising, it does not redeem the movie at all. It just left me with more questions about the odd future of this horrible person. [end spoiler]<br /><br />I was glad this was an Amazon Prime movie, so I didn't have to pay more than my standard fee to watch it. If I were you, I'd definitely think twice before watching, and skip it altogether if you have to pay for it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book would be good for any age of child! Parents, you should let your child read this book.

B002YK8OKC|1.0|Somehow I was charged for two rentals instead of one. I will never rent another another movie via download from Amazon.
B000003S5H|2.0|I very much enjoy Zero 7 music and bought this CD hoping to experience the same bliss.<br />Unfortunately I stand much disappointed. Most of the tracks sound short of inspiration and kind of cheesy to my ear.<br />This style of music skates on thin ice, often close to lapsing in the dreaded \\"background/elevator music\\" category.<br />That's my honest - if perhaps too harsh, assessment of Moon Safari. Not sure if other CDs from Air would fare better?<br />Oh well, the music quest cannot be always satisfying.

B007Y56JDQ|5.0|This is Richard at his best!  I have never been to one of his concerts but this made me feel like I was in the front row.  The duets are wonderful too.  It is nice to see others performing his songs with him.  The picture is very clear and the sound is great.  I highly recommend it.
B005HSL626|4.0|The game keeps freezing too much and got a four star review. Definitely annoying and recommend but be careful about that<br /><br /> g
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game had a bit of a learning curve for me but I do like a challenge.  Not at all like Angry Birds.  You must configure a vehicle to send through different scenarios and get to the prize at the end.  I like that you can restart the level over and over again until you get it right or a higher score.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This was a little over the top when it came to vulgarity. I am a fan of Seth McFarland, but a few jokes were just plain raunchy and I thought I was going to turn it off but then realized maybe it was just that one joke, but the line was repeated a second time. I thought I was open minded, but maybe not so much.  I thought the concept of a talking teddy bear was definitely a Seth McFarland trademark and over all was a pretty good idea, just that overall it wasn't a 5.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Love how it keeps me on my toes by changing characters and points of view. It always kept me guessing! And wanting to read more.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was very apprehensive about buying this book after reading all the 1 star reviews that complained about the ending. I enjoyed the book, right up to, what I thought, was the last chapter, and it did disappoint me. Until I turned the page to what was actually the last chapter.<br />Those who complained obviously didn't &#34;get it&#34; at all.

B004LWZW7O|2.0|In Time is a dystopic tale of a future where minutes of life have replaced dollars as the world's currency. It's the year 2169 and humans are now genetically engineered to stop aging at the age of 25 when a glowing clock -in their arm- begin counting downs to zero. No minutes means you die. Humans can add more time to their clocks by working, stealing and hustling, but your lunch might cost as much as 30 minutes, and a bus ride 2 hours. Since unlimited time would lead to overpopulation, the corporatist fascist behind the system use \\"timing out\\" as a way to control population.<br /><br />Enter Will Salas, an honest hard working 28 street kid (looks 25) who lives with his smoking hot mother (who also looks 25 -talk about awkward). The two live day to day, with less than 24 hours on their arm clocks at any time. Will works at a arm timer factory, where management is shown cheating him out of minutes. One night, at his favorite bar, he saves the life of a suicidal rich guy with more than a century on his arm clock. The rich guy rewards Will by giving a century of life before taking his own. Will than goes to meet his mother, but because she comes up minutes short on her bus fare,  she runs out of time before he can reach her, and times out (dies) in front of him. Will uses his new wealth to go to New Greenwich (where the rich people live)and hustle thousands of years as a poker player. Things turn bad and Will is becomes the murder suspect in the death of the rich guy who gave him the century. His escape involves the kidnapping of Sylvia, the daughter of a minute banking billionaire. The two fall in love and go on a Bonnie and Clyde crime spree.<br /><br />I have to say the premise of this movie is brilliant, as was the first 20 minutes. But after that it falls apart. It's almost like they wanted to write a serious critique of our economic system, but knew it wouldn't fill theater seats, so they turned it into a Bourn Ultimatum style action story after 20 minutes.So the next 20 minutes consisted of martial arts fight scenes and car chases.  But they didn't seem to know how to keep that action going, so they turned it into a Bonnie-and-Clyde crime spree movie, which seemed like plain old lazy writing to me.  Plus, where does a guy working in a timer factory learn to fight like Batman and play poker like Johnny Moss? Even worse than the structure was the dialogue. I guess the writers wanted us to know that despite the karate punches and car chases, they were making a serious movie about inequality. So they tossed in the lines that sounded like what a 6th grader might say after being brainwashed by Howard Zinn. It was all pretty lame and unconvincing.next 20 minutes consisted of martial arts fight scenes and car chases.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I have read this series multiple times, it has been copied by so many other authors for a reason. The characters are so interesting, the story sucks you in.  Just about everyone in my circle has read this series (and most have had their husbands read it as well!) and no one has had negative comments.  Makes me wonder if all of these one star ratings are from closed minded individuals who maybe should have read a review or two before purchasing to understand the genera.  I recommend this book, read it you will love it!

0893860468|4.0|A - possibly the - classic on Advaita.  If new to Advaita, one would do better to explore Nonduality briefly, to get some mental understanding of it, prior to reading I AM That ( which points beyond all mentality ).  I rate this I AM THAT and Ramana's Talks as two sources for inspiration and guidance for persons exploring the question &#34;Who am I?&#34; and, also, the spiritual philosophy of India.  Both Ramana and Nisargadatta point us to the nonideological, nondogmatic Truth that is already present, rather than the endless mentalisms that fascinate so many in spirituality and religion and, thus, demonstrate the egoic complicating that only diverts us from the obvious and simple Truth &#34;I AM.&#34;  Like Talks, this is in brief, dialogical segments, one segment short enough for reading in only a matter of minutes.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It does not have any of the specials features but I don't watch them anyway! This was a great purchase!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books were very explicit --- but it had a good story line.  Not fond of the author's writing though.  Used same words, phrases repeatedly throughout the book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I think that this is a story and Colleen is a writer that more people should know about.  U need to buy this book, you will not be disappointed.  Hoover writes about- strong women, sensitive men, emotional life events with wit and beauty.  She is sooo damn good.  I loved this more than slammed and point if retreat- and I really loved those books.  U will not be disappointed. enjoy
B0000541B2|5.0|I have bought the generic controllers a few times but I keep coming back to the real deal: SONY. This controller is the best there is and is well worth the extra money to purchase. Stick a fork in me........I'm done with the generic's. SONY Duel Shock Controller's rock!

B00APUYN0I|3.0|Good voices overall but really too unbelieveable/predictable with lots and lots of lip synching.  I added one star just for Rebel Davis; she makes this movie!  On the nit picking side, broadcast HD is never as good as Blu Ray for overall quality, but this isn't the type of movie I would buy, so the value is acceptable.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|My pre-Alien 24 year old son talked me into watching this.  Having been a big Ripley fan over 30 years ago (omg) and watching Ripley on DVD all those years ago, this was a nice followup, if not as heart pounding.  Loved Rooni as the female lead, loved the Peter O'Toole self styling of the android. The Guy Pearce character left something to be desired, though.

B008Y2IU12|5.0|Note: I saw the theatrical cut a few months ago with XFinity On Demand and I saw the Extended Cut a few hours ago.<br /><br />Snow White And The Huntsman is a unique take on the popular fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. Kristen Stewart does an incredible job as Snow White, Academy Award winner Charlize Theron really excels as the Evil Queen and Chris Hemsworth is terrific as The Huntsman. He reminds me of Brad Pitt, only with an Australian accent. Sam Claflin is somewhat underused here, but it's okay. The story draws you in from the opening music and doesn't let go until the final credits fade. Once again, James Newton-Howard creates a rousing, stirring and heart-rending score. See this film, and if this version isn't your particular cup of tea, stick with Walt Disney Pictures' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs & the smash hit ABC series Once Upon A Time.<br /><br />Now for my review of the Extended Cut of the movie.<br /><br />I don't have much to add to my review of the Extended Cut, other than what I said about the Theatrical Cut still stands, and the following. The Extended Cut of Snow White And The Huntsman is even better than the Theatrical Cut, in that it includes four minutes of footage not seen in theatres, and the scenes add a bit more to the story rather than slow it down. The film could have been much longer, like 2/1/2 to 3 hours, with more plot development, but the length of both versions is okay. I recommend the Extended Cut of the movie.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there isn't much to be concerned about, content-wise. As is usual with any film about Snow White, there is magic involved, and it's use here is more realistic and therefore could be frightening for younger viewers. There's one improper use of Hell and one use of P-ss, but aside from that, no additional cursing and absolutely no swearing (Damned is used a few times, but in an appropriate context). The violence is a little more realistic than usually portrayed in a film about Snow White, but there is barely any blood shown (save for a few scenes). There is one scene in both versions where the Evil Queen disrobes and dips into a milk bath; however, no nudity is shown thanks to the discreet camera angle when she drops her robe and her hands are over her breasts when she's shown from the front. It's very brief, though.<br /><br />There IS one film about Snow White that I would absolutely caution you about viewing, as I don't know if it's reviewed on this site. The film is Snow White: A Tale Of Terror. I do NOT recommend that version of the story due to the dark & heavy violence, frightening images and a satanic ritual that takes place near the end.ut there is barely any blood shown (save for a few scenes). There is one scene in both versions where the Evil Queen disrobes and dips into a milk bath; however, no nudity is shown thanks to the discreet camera angle when she drops her robe and her hands are over her breasts when she's shown from the front. It's very brief, though.<br /><br />There IS one film about Snow White that I would absolutely caution you about viewing, as I don't know if it's reviewed on this site. The film is Snow White: A Tale Of Terror. I do NOT recommend that version of the story due to the dark & heavy violence, frightening images and a satanic ritual that takes place near the end.
B001S86J0I|4.0|I love this movie, grew up watching it on VHS, and I finally switched over to dvd and I love it! The disc was in good condition and the case was well packaged, love it.<br />Thank you so much!

B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I liked the game pretty well,  but it was a bit slow. Takes too long to respond to touch,  and I'd like it better if there were more to do in each scene,  but definitely worth 99 cents!!

B00866JL96|5.0|This could be a Hallmark movie. It is a very feel good movie. Of course it is even better because of Zac Efron.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love it, can't wait to try more from this creater. the short videos we're cute, and love the puzzles, and the graphics also
B009CPN2G8|1.0|I actually liked the first two in the series and was willing to really be silly to appreciate the dogs, but this time they went too far into fatuousness.
B002BWP4A6|2.0|I did not really enjoy this movie.  The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is good, but the movie failed for me. While it was a bit \\"mysterious\\" and the acting was very engaging, I felt like the script plodded along at snail's pace without enough things going on to engage me in the movie itself. I cannot recommend this movie mainly for that reason.
B009CPES4I|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie as it was both funny and heart warming.  It is difficult to find many movies like this.
B004OYDVT0|5.0|Great songwriting, singing. One of the best albums in recent years. Performed by one of the most talented performers of recent years.
B003D7F3AO|3.0|I bought the DVD online in good faith.  What I got was obviously a bootleg copy.  I am not comfortable with that
B000005H3M|5.0|I like it quite well, but I also like Foie Gras. Will you llike this recording? I have absolutely no way of knowing that, but I can tell you this; If you liike any of the very talented Mr. Rich's otheer recordings, this one is worth a shot. A pretty sure bet or any fan of this type of music - highly recommended!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Kept me turning the pages and not wanting to put it down. I can usually figure out the killer by the middle of the book but this one kept me guessing.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Another Reacher novel that doesn't disappoint. This novel provides us with the reason Reacher becomes a civilian. As with all the Reacher novels there is plenty of action.
1451695195|5.0|Being a nurse, I appreciated this neurosurgeon's clear and specific account of his harrowing journey with eColi and as a woman of faith, I was reassured as he related his &#34;heavenly&#34; experience while in a coma.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Greatly enjoying the &#34;Dark Knight&#34; renditions of the Batman story. Nice tie-ins with old favorites, and Christian Bale has always fit this role very well.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|...the thing that turned me off to the book the most was Grey's character. He is such an ASS!!! I tried to stay with the book and made it to chapter 10, but he is such a self-involved jerk, I couldn't stand to read one more page.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was much better than I expected. Totally enjoyed the first book and was surprised that I liked this even more..Enough twists in the plot to keep your interest. Can't wait to read the 3rd book of the series.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It can be used as a stand in several different positions. Good protection for your Kindle Fire. :) :) :)
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I was afraid this would be impossibly hard, however it is a blast trying to figure out how to build some of these items.  What is nice is that they have different levels for different skill sets.  Truly worth the price.  Love it.
B0035FQ1UU|4.0|movie played great on my computer. the movie itself a little far-fetched but kept me on the edge of my seat.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I am not happy put it on my kindle fire and it didn't work and it said that  it would work did not
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is one of the all-time favorites that I watch every Christmas season. For me, this black & white version is the best one. It is a story about goodness and faith with a little love story thrown in. Very schmaltzy but so easy to watch. We enjoy watching it every year and have been known to watch it more than once a season.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its aglow game but there needs to be a free version of this game.abut besides that this game is great to play all day. Love this
1780891261|1.0|dolores j baylor would allow book to be given to evelyn coombes<br />  i had to go and get the book  how do i ship it back and get credit for it?

B005D4YHSO|5.0|Very Comfortable, true to size and washes well also looks better after age. The color started out a little green but then came around to the khaki color
B005IZLPMY|4.0|It was an average movie. The plot was predictable and the action was weak. It was probably the weakest of the Avenger movies.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Kesha is a talented songwriter and song arranger.  All the songs on WARRIOR express a savviness of what pop music can be when exhaustive work is put into both performance and production.  Each song is CRAFTED.  The hook presents itself almost immediately, followed by clever, bratty verses.  The lush vocals are often layered and harmonized to perfection, realizing a soundscape of voice and beats.  Each song embraces spacey bridges where step-phasers and counter-beat percussive elements redefine what you just heard.  Then you're back at it hard and heavy.<br /><br />I appreciate the amount of time and effort that went into the production of WARRIOR.  The pop genre would be given a great service if each performer and producer paid this much attention to their efforts.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I havent read the hole book yet a bit boring but un the future a will finish it i promise
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box. One of the best Harry Bosch of late. Keeps your interest start to finish. Turns into a page Turner...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is a great app, but runs like crap on tablets. It'll work for a minute then not, then seem to be ok, then crash. Plus this looks terrible on large screens, its the phone version scalled up for tablets and just terribly done. I found the reason why google play doesnt show as supporting nearly as many devices as this one does.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Over two hours of entertainment that you will watch over and over again. Make sure and continue watching after the production for an exciting tribute to the show!!!
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Story was a little dark and/or scary at times but overall it was a good movie and the kids enjoyed it.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Beautiful and sad. I have never read details more different than those that reside in this book.<br />A different outlook and somewhat refreshing.<br /><br />I recommend it to the empathetic and the curious, but also to any who have felt lost in the presence of death.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|One of the BEST Indie games ever made is now the FAOTD!!! GET IT!<br /><br />I played this on my PC and LOVED it!!<br /><br />Beyond a simple bridge-building game, this is one of the most entertaining puzzle games I've ever played!<br /><br />...I can't *Wait* to play it on my Android! ;-)<br /><br />Merry Christmas to EVERYONE! ^_^
0440244412|5.0|This was action-packed and satisfying. There was great tension between Mac and Barrons and fans of their relationship will be very satisfied. Everything definitely comes together in this book but it's not necessarily a happy ending. Moning, very realistically, leaves the world's problems unsolved. If you've made it this far, you'll eat this book up.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Like that it can either be plugged into outlet or into computer so that if I am on the computer while charging product, I don't have to run to a different outlet to charge Kindle.
030746363X|5.0|Already lost 30lbs with no hocus pocus promises.  Its smart and healthy way to lose weight without going broke.  Love that he also give page number to skip to.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Hard to put this book down once you start reading. Makes for a very late night, so start reading early in the morning of a day you have free of other commitments!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Good family entertainment !
B0086700CM|5.0|Honestly I don't even remember buying this game from Amazon, but the game is well made and I love it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I would love to write in depth how much is wrong with this book, however I do not have the patience. I bought this book because there was all this fuss surrounding it and I wanted to know why. I still want to know why. This reminds me of Twilight. The writing styles are similiar in the fact that it seems a sixteen year old girl describing her perfect man, just ridiculous. I couldn't even finish it. The fact that there are two more books blows my mind. In short: Do not waste you're money or time on this...book there is nothing of interest here.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Great price. I'd been wanting this show for a while. But I hate paying the huge prices when these type of shows !st come out. But Amazon is always there with the best deal.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|Unfortunately I could not download this app.  I went to B&N and downloaded the nook piano APP which I enjoy.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is living proof that there is still original ideas in Hollywood and, for me, it was the best animated movie of the year and one of the most original and clever films I've seen in a while.<br /><br />The story follows Wreck-It Ralph, a \\"bad guy\\" who is tired of being the character who's only purpose is to wreck things in an arcade game called \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\" Ralph dreams of being the hero, so he sets out to explore other games within the arcade to earn a highly-coveted medal, along with the respect he feels he deserves. The voice acting is top-notch here; John C. Reilly is great as the title character and Jack McBrayer is perfect as Felix Fix-It Jr. In fact, there isn't one member of the voice cast that is out of place. Even Sarah Silverman, whom I'm not much of a fan of, does a great job with her character, Vanellope von Schweetz. The story does have elements that are familiar, but sets itself apart by with the insertion of original jokes and clever references.<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about the movie is the appeal it has for everyone, whether it be little kids, adults, video game enthusiasts, or grandparents; there's something here for everyone. Those who grew up playing classic games like Pac-Man and Tapper will be overjoyed with some of the references this movie contains. It's fantastic to see companies collaborate and allow their properties to come together, and I sincerely hope they make a sequel. I also thought it was great how the creative team incorporated various gaming elements into the movie. For example, in the same scene they will have highly modernized characters with fluid movement interacting with jittery characters in the old 8-bit style, something I'd never seen in a film.<br /><br />As I said, this was the best animated film of the year for me and one of the most enjoyable I've seen in a long time. If you have nostalgia for old video games, you'll be sure to love this movie. I would highly recommend this to anyone.e.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie, Easy to stream with Amazon on demand video.  I wish the price was a little lower or the renal time period were longer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|wife loves it and plays it everywhere she carries her KF with her and plays<br />whenever she can find time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was the perfect end to the hunger games trilogy! It's by far my favorite book in the series!
B005HSL626|5.0|put on KF wife loves it plays allot and takes KF everywhere<br />good game while waiting for doctor or what ever.<br />I really like this game give it ten stars.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I bought this for like 7 dollars, it was definitely worth it, the picture quality is astounding, and I love Quentin Tarantino. Christoph Waltz is an incredibly talented multi-lingual villain, Brad Pitt has fun with his role, and the rest of the cast is brilliant. This movie has turned into one of my favorite Tarantino movies. It's obviously an alternate reality and not supposed to be taken seriously, like so many people have.<br /><br />I love that the original languages (french and german) are used, as opposed to many movies using american actors with foreign accents, and this is why I love Tarantino.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|i just found her last year after hearing a song that immediately stuck with me at the end of season 1 of revenge.  she is very good artist and i love her red hair
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I own this movie on DVD, but when I saw the low price on blu-ray I didn't hesitate. It's my favorite christmas AND romance movie of all time. The image quality is DEFINITELY better than DVD (think about it, a shirtless Rodrigo Santoro in hi-def!). This movie is enjoyable even in family (unless the casual nudity offends you).
B000S5E4SG|5.0|he is a god of vocals.  i worship this man's voice.  i would strongly recommend this and any of his music to anyone.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|I hadn't seen this movie in over 10 years, it used to play in our basic local channels when I was a kid, and I remember really liking it, being really afraid of the worm things, remembering mr. miyagi's death and thinking &#34;HOLY CRAP THEY JUST ATE MR. MIYAGI!&#34; lol. So when I saw it here for a really low price, I bought it, recently watched it, and loved it just as much as I did when I was a child. Definitely entertaining enough, Kevin Bacon is REALLY young in this, and you get to see Reba kicking some worm ass. The image quality in blu-ray is really good, considering this is a movie from the 80's.
B009YU62H2|5.0|hey i've been a fan of this band forever and then chris went his own way and i loved his solo stuff.  i listened to the samples a few times and then yesterday it was the right price and man does it jam.  i highly recommend it to any soundgarden fan.  it rocks...just a little more mellow but that comes with maturity.  i love it...5 stars..
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I love Zack Snyder's surreal special effects on all his movies. The movie is very entertaining, the soundtrack by Tyler Bates goes great with every scene, and Gerard Butler is great, but this is where I fell in love with Michael Fassbender. Many of the graphic novel elements are kept, as well as some historical facts. Not much is known about the spartans, and this is not an historically correct movie either, but some facts are kept, some are changed, either way, I really enjoyed this movie, and now I can enjoy it in amazingly high-definition.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller, nothing wrong with it. The moment my eyes fell down on the box I knew that it's genuine.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I love this movie, and I could watch it a thousand times. I decided to buy it in blu-ray since it was on discount. It was definitely worth it, the picture quality is awesome, and the movie is truly enjoyable. One of my favorites.
0823013626|5.0|Thanks to Donna Kato for an excellent book. Surprized at the length of book. Didn't expect that much information for the price.  Jim S
B008HK3SFO|4.0|I love this case but the Velcro is terribly loud! Keeps my kindle clean and protected. Happy with my purchase, though.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|It takes a lot for me to want to see movie more then once, so my being willing to see this film 10 times with family and friends should speak volumes. Well acted, choreography was great,and the songs were great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a very interesting real life experience written by a very accomplished physician,giving a look into the next life
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I got this game thinking that it was just like Angry Birds, only that the pigs had gotten their hands on the slingshot. Well, I was wrong. This game is great! I like making motorcycles and cars, and my brother refuses to play Angry Birds. If you like Rovio, but want a break from Angry Birds, you've just found your new addiction. But, I recommend getting the Ad-Free version, because in the middle of gameplay, (and this happens to me ALL THE TIME) a Temper-Pedic commercial starts playing. It is HORRIBLE!!!!!! Still, get the app.
B009CPES4I|1.0|The worst thing about it is the unintelligable British accents.  We couldn't understand half of what they were saying.  The humor is really strange.  Only watched about 20 minutes of it.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The movie is quite disappointing. I expected more as the plot was a bit dry and uninteresting from the 15 minutes onward. This clearly is a backward step from the previous installment.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|It's an OK movie.  It is pretty far out.  It isn't very credible.  It was long time ago that we watched it.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like the gameplay. Its not a very novel game, many other games are approximately the same concept. It seems to me also that the angles off the walls aren't exactly correct,  or it could just be me. Anyways, I can play this game for quite a while and for it being free it bad.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|I bought this for a friend who could watch this movie non-stop forever. She was very pleased with it. yippee
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of mine and my daughter's favorite games. We've played it a few times on my nieces iPod. I was so happy to see this game app available on the kindle fire I got my daughter. I was working on getting the Kindle set up so she could use it right out of the box. After I bought it and downloaded I sat and played this game for quite some time. It was difficult to put it up so I could wrap it for my daughter.
0393327655|5.0|Well written and documented!  The author provides new insight into a worthwhile concept. It should be read by everyone who has doubts about religion.
B0000024V2|5.0|I have been a Winter fan since 1969, so this was quite a blessing to be able to hear after many years. He does well with just a drummer and bassist. I liked his early lps such as this, but I never did get to hear much of his later recordings. This is some of his best hard rocking stuff, and the first of it's kind.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Got for aGreat price on black friday and<br />Quick 2 day shipment and<br />Good movie for family to enjoy together
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie has alot of singing in it by college students who are into music, really loved the movie it was funny and mostly clean considering todays movies of the same sort.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|25th Anniversary special features are great! One of Mel Brooks funniest movies that still makes me laugh years after first seeing it!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Its super ongoing Action with a Great Story Line. :) Enjoy The Movie its pretty intense and I will definitely be watching it again.
B009GEAWOU|2.0|I love this show, but to pay $2.99 per half hour episode is just too expensive.  Come On Amazon! You are Better than this.
B002ZG99NG|4.0|The Town has made it's way into the ranks of the best heist and bank robbery movies ever made. But for a better overall experience, you need to watch the Extended Alternate Cut. The extended portion of the film does more to develop the characters and provide a further backstory and the alternate cut changes the ending to a better, more fitting ending that faithfully reflects the source material.<br /><br />It may be 'Ben Affleck's' movie, but Jeremy Renner absolutely stole the show. In fact, Affleck may never again want to cast Renner in anything he does ever again because of how much he stole the show from Ben. If you've seen the Theatrical version and enjoyed it, but had issues with the ending, watch the Alternate Cut, it will change everything for you, I know it did for me.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It was not a spectacular film, but I do not think anyone expected it to be. It was definitely entertaining.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|So rarely does an event like this occur. Do I speak of the fifteen-year span of a trilogy? The immense critical success of a third film in a trilogy? Or am I simply speaking of the incredible blend of entertainment for the third consecutive time in a series for children and adults alike. I was fortunate enough to experience this trilogy from childhood to adulthood, although I really grew up watching Disney's classic traditionally animated films, which have now become more or less obsolete.<br /><br />The rage of 3 dimensional computer animated films has been in full swing since after the original Toy Story was released in 1995 and blew minds, now that a revolutionary 3D technology has been introduced to cinemas it's becoming even more popular. Pixar has achieved what has been perceived as almost impossible by producing hit after hit after hit, financially and critically, some not as much as others. The only way to understand Toy Story 3 and the impact and significance of the series it is to see the first 2 films, highly recommended in Blu-Ray or 3D. After being introduced to many lovable characters in the Toy Story cast and growing up with them, a big theme in the franchise, they become like intimate pals, characters that you can rely on to be the same time and time again.<br /><br />What this 3rd and almost assuredly final film does is take you to a very, very real and inevitable place, an ending. This can be a hard thing to accept because like many things in life you don't want this journey to end but like all things in life it has to at some point or another. After being attached to characters like this and seeing it all come to an end it is quite hard to keep a dry eye throughout the course of the film. In closing comments Toy Story has truly become an extremely important franchise, not only for the history of animated films, but for movies of all time.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I love Pixar movies and I was pleased to see one of their movies with a girl as the lead. Not as good as Toy Story, but then again, what is?! Still, it was a great movie.
B003E48AYC|1.0|I'm a big Alice in Wonderland fan, I've read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass and of course as any genuine fan, grew up on and absolutely cherish the original Walt Disney Classic (one of Disney's favorite stories as well). On that note, this movie is total garbage.<br /><br />I first hear Tim Burton (who I for a long time idolized) is doing an Alice in Wonderland interpretation and I initially hear a few years prior to the films release that it may be a dark stop action/live action film, ala The Nightmare Before Christmas with a live action Alice, which could have been pretty awesome. Much time passes and pictures of the characters start surfacing, I'm already worried at this point but I decide to trust Tim as I did with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which probably could have been much worse. This movie fails miserably on every level, acting, set design, costumes, dialogue, story, music, Avril Lavigne doing a song in a Tim Burton movie, what's up with that?!<br /><br />All the people that will like this movie are new age yuppies. The 3D gimmick only works well on a few films, this was not one of them. The film was originally not shot in 3D but because of the success of Avatar it was redone to get a better box office exit with it's shorter gap from the cinema to DVD. Beware of the ridiculous \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" Scottish accent and embarrassing dance coming from Johnny Depp's disgracefully portrayed Mad Hatter.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|I did not believe the reviews, my apologies for the distrust.  The worst Tom Clancy book ever and I have read them all.  this was written by an amateur, Clancy never read it or he would not have allowed  him name on the cover.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|I have to be honest, I am a Predator fan but only to the extent of the first film. Since then there have been 3 films featuring the Predator and they've all been terrible. Having said that I was pretty skeptical about this new Predator incarnation, even with Robert Rodriguez, who has done some killer flicks (Sin City, Planet Terror etc), overseeing the production. I was particularly shocked after seeing that Topher Grace had been cast, fearing yet again (Spider-man 3) he was miscast. Although in the end he was a little more than just comic relief, cool twist. I also thought the generally soft-spoken Adrien Brody, who can be an excellent actor, was miscast as `Arnold Schwarzenegger'. First off nobody can take Arnie's place in the world of Predator, Brody could pull of badass but he couldn't pull off Schwarzenegger badass.<br /><br />The dialogue was pretty generic (not uncommon in action flicks) probably should have stuck with the script Rodriguez originally wrote. One of the things I loved, particularly in Blu-Ray, was the aesthetics, the sceneries almost did make you feel like *spoiler alert* you were on another planet. All of the sound effects of the Predator were incredible the in camera make up (not CG) was awesome. On a final note, the film couldn't escape the horror movie formula of *spoiler alert again* killing almost everyone in the film off besides who you think wouldn't die, I do want to give Larry Fishburne mad props, he may not be known as much else besides Morpheus but *final spoiler alert* he was probably the best actor in the film.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I have been playing this game for months now on my galaxy and every time there is an update something always goes wrong with it. just to many things to list. now I just received the kindle fire and dowloaded the game on there and its still the same old problems. I cant collect energy from my inventory, the whole game just crashed. Its just horrible. Probably wont keep this game.
B000KQF6X0|2.0|Too generic and unimpressive to even be memorable. Surprising coming from Ridley Scott who has only done some of the greatest films of the 20th century (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator etc) Although Michael Douglas does a decent job portraying a NYC cop nothing really stands out here. Even his character is too trite and clich&eacute;, divorced, fighting for custody etc. The movie thrives on post 1980's style ie mullets, motorcycles and leather jackets, complete with an always 80's pair of aviator sunglasses. Could have been good if it was set in the future, say 2020 for the sake of 1989s vision (like 82s Blade Runners vision of Los Angeles in 2019)
B000YHG72E|3.0|B+ This movie is a Christmas must have. But get the uncut movie. That is version of the movie I really wanted to get.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|After falling completely off the wagon, as Walt Disney stepped down largely from the animated films at the end of the 1950's, this is, I would say, the greatest accomplishment of the lost Disney era (1960-1980). After Walt retired from this position, the individuals who came in his place were more concerned with saving money, recycling animation and doing everything cheap and quick (pshh, typical suits).<br /><br />This was NOT the motto of Walt Disney, which is why under his wing the best animation the world has ever seen was produced. Unfortunately by the time this film came out W.D. had succumbed to lung cancer, so he was never able to see the final cut of the film. Although this was during the period of cheap animation, it's obvious when the animation is this scratchy and unclean, the story was good, the songs were great catchy jazzy tunes, voice acting was on par contributing to the overall saving of the movie. Now every Disney movie in the world has their own fan base, there are movies lots of people love and movies not as many people love, but every Disney film is loved for one reason or another.<br /><br />The movies were also being much less produced then they had previously been, there were as many Disney films in the 1950's as there was from 1960 to the beginning of the new Disney Renaissance (1984-1994). Because of the quality of the films and reception after creating such great and seminal films as Cinderella how they could go to make hardly mediocre movies like The Aristocats?

B003YHSE7W|4.0|What had instantly become a critical and financial hit, not to mention a fan favorite among superheroes perhaps less known, Iron Man produced a sequel only 2 years later due to it's immense popularity. Probably the greatest thing about the first Iron Man film is that, nobody really knew what to expect. Those outside of the comic book community in fact were not very familiar or aware of the Iron Man character like they were of Spider-man or the X-Men.<br /><br />In addition Robert Downey Jr. had not created a very positive reputation in the preceding years and most did not know about director Jon Favreau's ability to helm a superhero flick. Well as it would be, all of this rode in favor of the novice superhero filmmaker and gave him the chance to wow the world with this movie. Because movie studios primary concern 99.9% of the time is making more and more money they green lit what was sure to be another money hungry superhero blockbuster and production was underway only a year after the first film had been released. Now this can result in a few outcomes.<br /><br />The movie could be horrible having rushed a screenplay, been careless with casting actors and performances and an overall lack of quality control. Luckily this was not the case. Although it wasn't as good as the first film, all too uncommon to do especially these days, this was a good Iron Man sequel. I think part of the reason it couldn't be as good as the first movie was because now that we all know how good the first movie was we expect par or perhaps even better. No expectation of the first film gave it the opportunity to blow us away.

B002UNMWAG|1.0|Do not be fooled, this film is most assuredly not the original indie sleeper hit we all know and love but almost a cheap imitation. After a 10-year hiatus from filmmaking, and with the mortgage on his house due, Troy Duffy turned to art to exploit his only cinematic achievement for money.<br /><br />Way too long of a runtime for a flick like this, the borderline ridiculous film sucks up tons of time doing flashbacks and random scenes with a character from the first film Rocco. Not to mention the use of a quirky confusing character to replace him. The film is really so much of a mess you might possibly even know less about the Saints after watching it. Duffy was quite obviously trying to fill a futile void to recreate his success. Once again another disaster of unseasoned filmmaking.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Kinda was lacking on story line and just going fro effects! I love the series but you could tell they are running out of steam.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Another of Walt's personal favorite stories that he had been trying to get produced for a decade prior to it's 1953 release. For people that were not familiar with the classic JM Barrie novel, which is probably very few children at the time, this movie embodied the story of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys for everyone, for all time. The movie was released during the period where Disney was relentlessly releasing masterpieces and ultimately building up the reputation it is now so famous for. All of the great and iconic voices of the characters have become staples in animation. Neverland is definitely a destination we all would love to visit as children and Peter Pan makes it even more so.<br /><br />One of the greatest aspects of this film is the villain, Disney being notorious for having the greatest villains in animation in the Evil Queen, the Stepmother, the Hunter, making the villain-less films really lack this quality. I'd have to say Captain Hook is the most famous of all Disney villains, mostly because he has a hook for a hand, how could you forget that? The pirate theme is also something kids of all ages and all generations love and will continue to love. Ignore all sequels, prequels or spin-offs from the film, I'd say this for all Disney movies, if you are a purist like I am it's just a scam that the current money hungry Disney Co. has employed to rake in cash.

0316010669|5.0|I took a speed reading class one summer, and the book we were practicing on was Blink.  First, I recommend learning speed reading.  If you stick with the techniques that you learn, you can read at speeds exponentially faster than what you're currently at.  Second, with regards to this book, I'd say it's pretty good.  The material is very interesting, it really gets you thinking a different way.  Malcolm Gladwell sure knows how to write books.  He is an excellent author, and I think that this book should be on your to-do list for the next year.  There is a little too much fluff in the book surrounding the juicy details, but nothing's stopping you from skimming past that.
1419553429|5.0|One of the best books while preparing for hard questions... To learn new strategies this book Will be really helpful.
0307949508|2.0|The first book in this trilogy was  modestly entertaining  with too many improbabilities to be considered well crafted. This formulaic sequel takes improbability to a new level, adding poorly written dialogue and shallow characterizations. The psychological and medical  discussions are factually incorrect, and add to the book's amateurish feel.  Larsson does not  even get simple anatomical details correct. Perhaps a skilled editor could have improved the situation, but it's too late for that now.

He didn't check very carefully and it's actually hard to find that information, but we were very disappointed, that they didn't add this song to the CD. Greed does seem to have no end.<br />The rest of the music is good,.

As a parent, you question what your feelings would be, put in this horrible situation. That I didn't anticipate the ending added to the enjoyment. I will definitely read this authors other works.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Love the fact that I can now share the movies I loved when I was a kid to my children.<br /><br />Didn't like the fact that the movie menu was completely digitalized and I actually had to begin to watch the movie to make sure it wasn't like that the whole way through.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Disney movies.
B009JBZH54|5.0|As soon as i heard about this i knew i had to get it! i'm a big Batman fan. the case is nice looking and sturdy. once you open the box you see the movies and their special features right there. and the fact that it comes with digital copies of the three is even better! can't wait for the Ultimate Collector's Edition next year!

B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I thought the cards were going to explain how to build the clues but instead it just gives you pictures of a space ship, house or shoes. It really takes imagination to come up with building the object and then for the team to guess it. Not like our other lego game and my children are 7 and 10 which really struggle with it and even the adults were having trouble. Like I mentioned we are disappointed.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I saw it on sale for 2.99, liked a couple of songs, and figured I had nothing to lose. Turns out, the whole album is great.  Nice sound, great energy!
0812993357|4.0|This is a great book!  It is a very easy, if occasionally thoughtless read (I sometimes found myself off track and daydreaming), CHOCK FULL of her personality.  The way she structures the book is lovely, and if you love Karl Lagerfeld - this book is for you!  It is full of KL anecdotes.  The one about him wearing a monocle and perfuming his beard with a discontinued perfume just made my week.  Just a great book.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie and, when it came out in Blu-ray I had to have it.  It did not disappoint me.  George C. Scott is Patton and this is his greatest role.  Technically this DVD is very good and looks great on my 60in screen.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It takes time to explain why TDKR failed to deliver a story equal to its successor, but in the end, TDKR's failures amount to much more than just the absence of Ledger and plot inconsistencies.  IMO, Hardy's Bane was more than a suitable replacement for the Joker and TDK had its share of plot inconsistencies.  But inconsistencies ultimately don't amount to much in the kinds of stories Nolan sets out to tell through his Batman series.<br /><br />Unlike most comic book films, Nolan's Batman series was successful in producing characters that were above and beyond human.  Batman, Joker, Bane and Ra's Al Ghul were established as mythological demigods, more like Hercules and less like relate-able human beings - or at least that was the goal.<br /><br />Nolan succeeded in building up the Joker as an \\"Agent of Chaos\\" in the second film.  The man had no identity, no face and no discernible psychology (very intentional on part of Ledger and Nolan).  The result was something we weren't used to seeing: a force uncontested by mere humans and countered only by an equally powerful hero, someone who was \\"More than just a man.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, Ra's Al Ghul was too relate-able as a human being to be presented simultaneously as a demigod (for lack of a better term).  He had a face, he was compelled by very human emotions (the loss of loved ones as he alluded earlier in the first film).  You could see that Nolan was aiming for in Batman Begins.  But he ultimately fumbled Al Ghul's character and Batman himself was brought down by the blunder - by meeting his match in a relate-able human character, Batman himself is established as little more than a relate-able man.  Not only was Al Ghul too relate-able, but his character wasn't present for most of the film.<br /><br />These kinds of demigod-type characters like the Joker NEED screen-time to be full established emotionally.  It's because of this kind of mythological story telling that a logical plot ultimately isn't as important as consistent emotional establishment of who the heroes and villains are and the themes each of them represent.<br /><br />The Dark Knight succeeded in delivering these super-human characters and it looked like the The Dark Knight Rises was going to be just as successful, if not more.  The Joker was like a force of nature, but was very limited in his influence.  Even though it seemed like Luck and Fate itself were on the Joker's side, he wasn't physically intimidating without his knives and his charisma and influence were limited only to the mentally unstable.<br /><br />Enter Bane, a Hannibal-Lector like warlord who carried all the physical prowess and charismatic leadership the Joker lacked.  While the Joker had Luck as his ally, he was no match for Bane's potency as a sort of inevitable and divine judgment about to come down on Gotham City.  Scene's like Gordon's escape from Bane's hideout painted the man as both judge and executioner, as he pronounces the error of his lackey before carrying out his execution.  And in just about every scene you see Bane's hands, someone is brutally killed.<br /><br />Nolan flawlessly established Bane through emotional characterization and mythological lore, until about the last 20 minutes where he attempts a sort of bait and switch.  It's revealed that Talia Al Ghul is the true mastermind behind Gotham's destruction and Bane is simply her lackey.  As Talia explains that she was Al Ghul's child, you even feel a glimmer of pity for Bane as she reassembles the mask, which while alienating Bane as a relate-able human being earlier in the movie, makes him sympathetic when we learn how vulnerable he becomes when his pain-relieving medications are delayed - the difference between his previous victory with Batman in a one on one fight and his later defeat boils down to distraction from a painful wound?<br /><br />All of the fear that Nolan had established in Bane is gone the instant Talia's true identity is revealed and yet NOTHINGthat Nolan established in Bane translates over to Talia Al Ghul, who is, as far as we've seen, a career woman, completely human in nature and entirely lacking the potential we imagined we saw in Bane.  First of all, she wears no mask; her human face betrays any attempt to establish a demigod in Talia.  Secondly, it's never appropriately established that she possesses any real abilities other than an ability to manipulate Bane.  While she is revealed as Ra's Al Ghul's child, Ra's Al Ghul was never himself sufficiently established as the demigod Nolan had envisioned (not to the audience anyways) and even if he were, Bane's potency derives from what we've seen him doing, NOT what we've heard other characters saying about him.  Talia is completely insignificant compared, not just to Bane, but even characters at the level of Catwoman (who is halfway between the demigod hero villains, as she's driven by very human motivations of self-gain and self-preservation) or Two-Face/Harvey Dent.  Having Talia Al Ghul revealed as Bane's Master and stabbing Batman in the back would have been as bad as having Commissioner Gordon single-handedly defeat the Joker, or Al Ghul, or even Bane.  For crying out loud, she dies in an AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT!  Can you think of a more pedestrian way for the Judge of Gotham to perish???<br /><br />As Bane is revealed as a puppet and his master as a run-of-the-mill peon, the film, along with its high-stakes conflict are left without an antagonist.  And without an antagonist, all the drama quickly evaporates and leaves us with the revelation that there never really was any.<br /><br />This kind of plot-twist is very appropriate in a spy-thriller from Tom Clancy, which features flawed and limited human beings in the central conflict.  It utterly fails in a story like this because the drama in a mythos-type story derives from seeing which force of nature will win out over the other.  There is a very big difference between drama that comes from limited characters doing the best within their natural constraints and forces of Nature itself vie for supremacy, which in a sense are immortal, very lucky, super-potent and in any case exist and operate outside natural constraints that the rest of mankind is bound by.<br /><br />Additionally, if we're going to start viewing this trilogy through the lens of consistency and logic necessary to feel drama arise from a plot-twist, then the rest of the story immediately begins to fall apart.  How could Batman heal his back in 3 months?  How did he arrive in Gotham City?  How could the Joker depend on the school buses driving by at exactly the right time to evade the police?<br /><br />Like I said, it takes time to adequately explain why this film failed to rise to the level of the second entry.  In my opinion, had Talia never been in the film and Bane simply been played straight as the sole mastermind of Gotham's destruction, along with a very different ending which pits Batman against Bane, TDKR would have easily surpassed the second.  We would have had the chance to see Batman rise to an even higher level of demigod-hood in confronting a force that surpasses the Agent of Chaos we knew as the Joker.<br /><br />At this point, it seems obvious to me that the mastery of TDK came from Ledger's prominence as the Joker, because if Nolan truly understood the kind of story he had been crafting, he would have never obliterated his primary antagonist in a VERY misguided attempt at some kind of cheap trick espionage-style drama. Nolan ultimately did NOT know what he was doing and while we, the audience might not have been able succinctly describe our disappointment while leaving the theater, we all knew there was something terribly amiss.<br /><br />And it wasn't just Ledger.

B0076DELIG|5.0|I've been a Michael Connelly fan for a long time, and have collected either on Kindle or in paperback format, all of the books in the Harry Bosch series.  People who enjoy elegant use of language with a touch of humour and humanity will appreciate each of these volumes. Connelly is consistent in offering a good story along with the slow revelation of who and what Harry Bosch is all about. I've never been disappointed in good old Harry - and admire his integrity and guts. The Black Box is another one I'm glad I purchased.
B00846F1YW|2.0|Main point, and the only thing I'm interested in saying is when you get to Chapter 13, task 1, you find everything that your suppose to then when it goes to load the next chapter, it kicks you out of the game completely. So I tried it again, couple of times and the same thing.  Ya know, it doesn't matter if you pay .99, or 2.99 for the game. I for one just want a game that play's all the way to the end. Get you money's worth. I'm a little apprehensive on ordering games by Nevosoft. Instead of writting and complaining to Amazon, (because we know how much help we'll get from them), maybe go right to Nevosoft themselves. The game is fun and I really liked it, just to bad you don't get to play it to the end. And because of that \\"I don't like it\\" ...

B007STBUIW|5.0|Perfect for larger screens for a more immersive experience. Still jump at all the scary moments with large screen and home theater surround. Free download to iPad maintains HD quality. Better than Shark Week.<br /><br />UPDATE: I use PS3 as my blu-ray player.  No issues on first playback in early Dec 2012. Then Universal messed up the online access to new trailers.  This Blu-Ray disc and others from Universal (e.g. Fast Five) hangs on loading.  However, it does play if you disconnect your Internet access before inserting the disc. But, this is a pain.  If you have a PS-3,  stay away from Universal Blu-Ray movies until they fix this or live with having to disable your Internet access.  Not sure if this is unique to PS-3 playing Blu-ray or not.  This is the status as of 30 Dec 2012.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie is somewhat based on the original, but then takes a different story line with a different ending.  While I thought it was a good action movie, it did seem to drag on. The chase scenes were to long with not enough substance of a story line and in the end the movie started to drag and both my husband and I started to loose interest. There are movies when time flys, this was not one of them.  I give it just an ok.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|I have been playing Guitar for thirty years, and its awesome when you find something that is inspiring like this DVD. Its great to get insight to what these guitarist think in conjunction with the history and all the technology that is and was available to them at that time.  This is a must for any guitar player at any level. The producers of this show hit three generations of musicians (very Smart) and I am sure they were very inspired by it as well as the musicians who are featured in this DVD who were by each other.
B00006AW2M|3.0|I never had this album on vinyl, so why not give it a try. It has some good songs, Mostly sounds like a acid fuled disc. This was their answer to Sgt. Pepper.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It is a flash to the past.  I am enjoying playing it again.  I gave it 4 stars because while the controls work pretty well sometimes changing directions is unsuccessful.  It overshoots and goes by the turn.
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|Fantastic movie. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys supernatural movies. Why do I have to keep typing.... I don't want to talk more.
B003YGSLDA|3.0|I remember liking this movie as a kid. I was looking forwards to revisiting it. People need to be aware that even though the packageing and Amazon listing state that this movie has English and German subtitles - it in fact has NONE. If you have a need for the subtitles do not purchase this. There is no option anywhere on the menus for subtitles and there is no result when you push on the remote's subtitle button.

B007MDB71O|5.0|HOW did this movie not rake in the BIG BUCKS? It wasn't because the movie was bad, I know that much.  I've watched this movie over 30 times and I'll watch it 30 more when my DVD comes in.  They picked great actors for every character.  The creature that barked like a dog was adorable. The love story was completely built up.  The death of his earth wife was put in all the right places.  The battles were great. The costumes were beautiful. I sure hope I get a chance to go back to Barsoom!  Get the movie, watch the movie, pray for a sequel!!!!!!!
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Yes, this is a film about snowboarding. Does that mean that only people interested in snowboarding can appreciate it? Absolutely not. A do snowboard, but I also study film and Art of Flight is an absolute triumph in film making. This movie is absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and the scenery is second to none. The camera-work alone makes this film worth watching, but adding a heart-racing soundtrack as well as some of the most progressive snowboarding on earth and this film is a must-watch.
003061368X|5.0|A most captivating book that is hard to put down, and a refreshing change in viewpoint, escaping the fanatical negativity of the Tudor faction to see Richard III as a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, and just as pious, generous, caring Dickon.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Pooh-pooh-ers of the Generation X persuasion may rake me over the coals, but I'll shout it from the rooftops anyway: The 2012 big screen remake of 21 JUMP STREET is better than the original. And maybe it's the low expectation... I never anticipated this movie to be this entertaining and this funny. The rumor mill indicates a sequel is in the offing. I'm so down with that.<br /><br />Whereas the Fox television series was a straight-up undercover police drama with teen angst thrown in, the film lifts the original premise but then veers off into different territory. The modern-day 21 JUMP STREET tilts heavily towards raunchy comedy, with the teen angst spun for laughs. It's a clever and affectionate spoofing of 1980s nostalgia and of familiar teen movie clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Seven years after high school, former pudgy nerd Schmidt and dim bulb ex-jock Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) are reacquainted in the police academy. Despite inhabiting opposite ends of the social spectrum, Schmidt and Jenko become pals. Something about one's reach not exceeding one's grasp, and the pair while on bike patrol ef up royally during a drug bust. They're reassigned to an undercover unit in which youthful-appearing cops pass themselves off as high school students to investigate crimes. Schmidt and Jenko are tasked with infiltrating a high school and smoking out the main supplier of a new synthetic drug. But Schmidt and Jenko take the \\"smoking out\\" bit too literally.<br /><br />Schmidt and Jenko are in for a culture shock. Things have switched up since their time in school seven years ago. Comic books and being environmentally responsible are now cool. Suddenly Schmidt is the cool kid on the block and Jenko, the dumb loser. Jenko's response: \\"Fudge you, Glee!\\" (Except he didn't really say \\"Fudge.\\")<br /><br />No cow is too sacred to slay in this movie. Tropes from buddy cop cinema are exposed and poked fun at. Even Channing's age is brought up more than once, how he looks more like a 40 year old than a teenager. I love how the action scenes would play out in typically thunderous fashion but then suddenly get undermined by either the switching of camera perspectives or the sudden muting of the score. 21 JUMP STREET will have you laughing end to end. Several satisfying cameos are guaranteed to stretch that grin. Just keep in mind that there are copious moments of profanity and drug use.<br /><br />Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Channing Tatum are pitch perfect. Tatum, especially, is a revelation, proving here that he can do comedy. He submits one of the most hilarious deadpan performances of the past few years. 21 JUMP STREET had no right to be this funny and sweet. I don't want to neglect Ice Cube's awesome turn as the unit's sullen head honcho. Sodapop came out my nose over his line about Korean Jesus.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary with directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller & actors Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum<br />- \\"Back to School\\" - behind-the-scenes peek with the cast & crew (00:07:44 minutes)<br />- 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:08:33 minutes)like a 40 year old than a teenager.

B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I enjoyed watching TOTAL RECALL 2012 through Amazon Prime Instant Video app on my iPad.  The rental was more competitive than other alternatives which is a plus.  The movie itself was action packed and the plot somewhat mind bending though not to the point of getting head ache from trying to figure out what is going on.  This was a great remake.  I recommend it!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Packaging was very good, and neat. The movies looked great taking into consideration they were not filmed recently like the last one!

I have seen the movie, and despite what a lot of people think i have always loved the movie. I love the characters and the idea of this alternate universe where nixon has been elected 3 times, we won vietnam, masked heros truly exist, and dr manhattan is a part of the world. Looove dr manhattan. Altogether a great book. I recommend it

B000AP04MO|5.0|This movie is a classic. The ups and downs in a relationship are presented in an interesting manner. As usual Audrey Hepburn shines in this movie. She has a presence on the screen, she is beautiful, and it is very easy to be in awe, but she also shows a very human, vulnerable side which is why I so enjoy watching her films. All I can say is Buy it!!

0312427646|4.0|Royal waves, tiaras, weddings, princes, princesses...suffice it to say, I'm a closet royalist.<br /><br />Diana, Katherine, William, Elizabeth - I love them all (except maybe Camilla) and would gladly live as a royal for at least one day.<br /><br />With that obsession - it's only obvious that I would adore Alan Bennett's The Uncommon Reader - a reimagining of Queen Elizabeth, in her later years, becoming a voracious reader.<br /><br />With the appearance of the mobile library in the palace courtyard, Queen Elizabeth's day to day life is about to change dramatically.  Once focused on the needs of her subjects, The Queen is now eager to read the next book in her TBR stack.<br /><br />In addition to being witty, original, and uniquely British - it was also a lexiconic wonderland of words like opsimath, amanuensis, and solipsistic.<br /><br />Also - the Queen had some great quotes (and thoughts):<br /><br />\\"...briefing is not reading.  Briefing is terse, factual and to the point.  Reading is untidy, discursive and perpetually inviting.\\"<br /><br />And<br /><br />\\"Pass time...books are not about passing time.  They are about other lives.  Other worlds.  Far from wanting time to pass...one just wishes one had more of it.  If one wanted to pass the time one could go to New Zealand.\\"<br /><br />And<br /><br />Books did not care who was reading them or whether one read them or not.  All readers were equal, herself included.<br /><br />My only quibble with this book - there was a reference to a sexual act that was odd and totally unnecessary.<br /><br />Aside from that - if you fancy a jolly good read (you can read this in one sitting), please pick up this book.  At the end, you'll realize that you and the Queen have far more in common than you once thought.<br /><br />Keep calm & carry a good book.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|\\"The Debt\\" is an intelligent spy thriller that will appeal to both those who enjoy a good spy movie as well as those who enjoy well-written intellectual dramas. This film manages to combine the complex tale of an attempted abduction of a Nazi war criminal in 1960s Berlin, a love triangle among the three Mossad agents assigned to capture him, and the repercussions of their acts more than 30 years later. Featuring excellent performances by Jessica Chastain (does this woman make a bad movie?), Sam Worthington, Tom Wilkinson, and Helen Mirren (who proves yet again that her range as an actress knows no limits), \\"The Debt\\" is a deeply satisfying film that refuses to settle for easy answers. Highly recommended.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Brittany Snow has way more talent than this movie showed, writing was thin and lacked creativity and the plot was sophmoric.<br />This movie had potential but failed to bring it all together.
0312576463|3.0|Amazing to me, insofar as my personal tastes are concerned, what a difference feeling  sympathy for characters makes in my enjoyment of a book. Not that this book is short (608 pages), but I had a slog getting through it--so many characters and so little interest in what happened to them.<br /><br />The lack of enjoyment notwithstanding, I have to admit that Franzen's ability to write original prose shines through. I finally became involved in Joey, Patty and Walter's spoiled-to-the-bone child. I enjoyed the book most when Joey met his match in the equally spoiled Jenna--sister of Joey's college friend--equally spoiled and perhaps even more detestable. In reading their encounters, I was reminded of the satisfaction I felt reading Dombey and Son (Dickens, 1846-1848): Dombey meeting more than his match in Edith.<br /><br />By the end of the book, Joey has changed for the better, without our knowing just why he changed; same for his mother, Patty; same for Walter's friend, Richard. Walter, by the time you turn the last page, has returned to being the person he was in the early going. I came closer to feeling sympathy for Walter than I did feeling it for any other character.<br /><br />Perhaps the message of the book, or at least the message I derived from finishing it, was that people seldom do well with freedom or too much of it.<br /><br />By way of criticism: This book is too episodic for my taste--long tracts mostly focusing on a single character, so long that I lost track of who some of the early characters were.<br /><br />Although I had planned to read all of Franzen's novels, I think I won't get to his two other works of fiction (The Twenty-Seventh City and Strong Motion) for a while.
B009POCG2C|4.0|I bought this movie for the cast. All are great except Justin Timberlake who basically plays himself.<br /><br />The story is a blend of MoneyBall (baseball) and Gran Torino (grumpy old man). The difference is the underlying family story. That bit of humanity makes it different and enjoyable. It's a bit on the light side, but that works too.
0307408833|3.0|Beautiful to look at, and peruse...my irritation liesin one major issue: a load of the recipes if not the majority rely on Bob's All Purpose...which contains bean flour and is very off-tasting to loads of tastes buds. Not only that...by requesting a specific all-purpose blend as opposed to individual flours leaves people hanging and less able to make subs.  I dislike a reliance in any recipe or cookbook on all purpose blends.  I am sure I could make my own....but know it will be an experiment that could fail if I do, and you buy cookbooks so you have some sure-fire recipes to count on.<br />I admire this woman for creating what she has, and am glad people with food allergies have an actual store to enjoy baked goods....but this cookbook was not for me.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Never figured it out until the last few minutes.  Was it based on a true incident?  If not, it very well could have been.
B00479SVBU|2.0|What this product does well is send a strong signal through FM so it delivers strong sound without contamination from FM radio broadcasts.<br />What it doesn't do well is everything else.<br />How do you play your music? If you are like me, you want to be able to access your music by artist, album, genre, or song. This device does not allow any of that. It accesses files by folders and files. If you want artist of album you would have to set up a directory structure with an artist level and a lower album level. Forget genre or song access - I suppose you could do song access if you are willing to scroll through thousands of files to get to the one you want.<br />This problem is compounded by the fact that you are limited to 99 folders and 1999 files. They highlight the fact that you it can access a usb or sd device up to 32gb in size. Well, 32gb can handle almost 10,000 typical mp3 files - so sticking in anything larger that 8gb is most likely a complete waste of memory. And the 99 folders? I think I'm reasonably typical in that I organize my ripped mp3's by artist, then by album. This means that my actually pretty small library consists of several hundred folders and several thousand files - both way beyond the firmware capabilities of this unit.<br />The bottom line? This is a good FM transmitter. It is a terrible mp3 player. Since the only way for me to access all my music and access it in the way I want is to plug a separate mp3 player which can handle my library and my access requirements into the aux input and use this strictly as an fm transmitter. Well...... there are good fm transmitters that are much simpler and cheaper than the soundfly.<br />If they ever produce firmware for this unit that 1) actually effectively allows you to utilize the full 32gb capability and 2) lets you organize and access and play your music the way most listeners want to then it would be well worth the money. The unit I bought is being returned.<br />Oh. and the remote was DOA.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have played it and learned love this game. I didn't even know it was for moblie until now. It is epic as well! If you wanna buy the app after the date of this review, check Wildtanget Games (I am not an employee or a parther with this company), as they will allow you to test the full version twice with free sessions of it. If you like it, you can buy the moblie version, or just get the darn game for nada if you are a Gamefly (Also not an employee or parther either) Member. Wildtanget is free, but Gamefly is not. If you did like the free sessions for this game on Wildtanget, you can buy this game here for around less than 2$ than Wildtanget. I would buy this game if I was allowed to anytime! I recommend it! Look, this game is indie, so it is very high quality for just two people and a first game, though I think they had training. This game can even compete with Halo as well! However, if you only love this game because of you being able to see how you compete with the world, this version is not for you.<br /><br />NOTE: Stop reading unless if you wanna be spoiled of the first world's ending!<br /><br />At the end of the first world, your goo balls go fly up and away from the world. The first time I saw this, I actually cried. I love those goo balls. It was sad.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I generally like this case.  It fits well and looks good.  My only reservation is that the angled stand is a little flimsy - it is fine for just sitting on the desk but not so good for surfaces that are not level such as a mattress.  I often use my Fire in bed at night  and the stand collapses when the cover falls out of the thin scored line in the back of the case.<br /><br />Good value for the price depending on how you want to use the stand.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Loved it. Very funny. Not for kids. If you like family guy? You will love Ted. Not to mention Milan Kunis, how can you not LOVE her.

1451648537|5.0|Critics who magnify Steve Jobs' abrasive personality above his creative genius come from the same mold as people who think that never-ending deficit spending can result in prosperity  -- they have a non-essentialized assessment of what's good and what's bad in the world, and they tend to arrive at their world-view dismissing important elements which should have instructed their outlook.<br /><br />In the spirit of the moment I got myself a MacBook Air, my first venture into the world of Mac, after decades of the clunky ole' PC.<br /><br />I recommend anybody give it a whirl -- and just as everyone says, the Mac is \\"beautiful\\" and it is \\"rewarding\\" to just hold it in your hands! And it is easier to type on than anything I've ever had all these many years. Every day I experience Steve Jobs saying: \\"it has to be this way and not that way!\\" Jobs calls the design \\"insanely great.\\"<br /><br />As Isaacson's tale unfolded, I was drawn into a spell -- who could resist astonishment at what Jobs was able to do? He was driven to create beautiful things. And the obstacles in his way would have been insurmountable to anyone else.<br /><br />He wanted to build something beautiful and something simple. \\"It takes a lot of hard work to make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.\\" Jobs' declaration stands behind the essentialized premise: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. He would say: \\"To be truly simple, you have to go really deep.\\"<br /><br />He loved the simplicity of Atari's games:  \\"The only instructions for Atari's Star Trek game were: 1. Insert quarter. 2. Avoid Klingons.\\"<br /><br />And where Jobs ended up was \\"at the intersection of humanities and science,\\" at the intersection of art and technology. He ended up creating beautiful things that everybody wanted.  He ended up creating whole  new devices and services that consumers did not yet know they needed.  He ended up with the largest company in the world, surpassing Exxon-Mobile.  It was a stunning accomplishment.<br /><br />He did it for the beauty, not for the money. He even cared about the look of the parts inside that you couldn't see.<br /><br />He did it by following Wayne Gretsky's maxim: \\"Skate where the puck's going, not where it's been.\\"<br /><br />He did it by building a team of A-plus players whom he could count on. It's the same thing that Andrew Carnegie did a century earlier; Carnegie always claimed that his success was all tied to the people he surrounded himself with. Jobs did the same thing.<br /><br />He did it by being simultaneously a strategic thinker and a master of the tiniest details. He was deft at framing the big picture and he was deft at mastering details.<br /><br />He did it by harnessing outrageous positions. Jobs decreed, to the astonishment of his colleagues, that the iPod should not have an on-off switch. The iPod killed the Walkman, which had been the world's leading personal music device. Sony's product was decimated. In January 2007, iPod sales accounted for half of Apple's revenues.<br /><br />He did it with vision. He dreamed up the idea of a computer that could fit on your lap, with a keyboard and screen hinged together like a notebook. He held up a Styrofoam mock-up of the laptop and said: \\"This is my dream of what we will be making in the mid- to late-eighties.\\" Nobody had ever heard of a laptop before that. It was born in Jobs' imagination.<br /><br />He did it by thinking: \\"customers don't know what they want until we've shown them\\"<br /><br />He did it by cooking up gadgets that we didn't know we needed, but then suddenly we couldn't live without them. I cannot live (today) without my new MacBookAir. I cannot jog without my iPod. I start each day putting my iPhone in my pocket. We cannot go a week without our AppleTV. I guess the iPad is inevitable.<br /><br />He did it ignoring the experts who prescribed market research before going into production. \\"Did Alexander Graham Bell do any market research before he invented the telephone?\\" Jobs asked.<br /><br />He did it with wit and humor. Asked about the fact that Apple's iTunes software for Windows computers was extremely popular, Jobs said: \\"It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell.\\"<br /><br />He did it with strategic thinking. Jobs began a whole new concept: the computer as a hub for all your digital activity [music players, video recorders, cameras, video players, TV].<br /><br />He did it ignoring the experts who said that the Apple retail stores would be a flop. The Apple stores average annual revenue per store was $34-million in 2010; they accounted for only 15% of Apples revenue; and they created priceless buzz and brand awareness and helped boost everything the company did.<br /><br />Apple's Fifth Av store, open 24/7, grosses more per square foot than any store in the world. It also grosses more in total -- absolute dollars, not just per square foot -- than any store in New York. That includes Saks and Bloomingdale's.<br /><br />And all the experts said those Apple retail stores would be a flop. The Apple Store is the best store in the Maine Mall. It might even be the best store on Fifth Avenue, down the street from Tiffany's.<br /><br />He did it emphasizing beauty. When you take your iPod out of the box, it is so beautiful that it seems to glow, and it makes all other music players look as if they had been designed and manufactured in Uzbekistan.<br /><br />He did it by deep focus on details. Designing the iPad, Jobs demanded that it signal that you could grab it with one hand, on impulse. So he gave the bottom edge a slight rounding, so that you'd feel comfortable just scooping it up rather than lifting it carefully.<br /><br />And now it's all over. Can any of you fathom how fast it all happened?! Prior to 1975 no one in history had ever typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer's screen right in front of them. Can you believe that never happened up to 1974, ever?<br /><br />As he was dying of cancer, he looked back: \\"Hewlett and Packard built a great company, and they thought they had left it in good hands. But now it's being dismembered and destroyed. It's tragic. I hope I've left a stronger legacy so that will never happen at Apple.\\" I hope so, too.<br /><br />Jobs' half-sister, Mona Simpson, wrote an astounding eulogy which was published in the NY Times. You must read that now. [...]<br /><br />I'm fully bracing myself for the company to drop its quantity and quality of innovation; so we must cherish the products that are currently being produced -- anything beyond that is a matter of crossed fingers. Bill Gates said: \\"The integrated approach (Jobs' approach) works well when Steve is at the helm. But it doesn't mean it will win many rounds in the future.\\"<br /><br />I love him for: \\"if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It's my job to be honest.\\" His was the quality of honesty that set the stage for a historic gathering of A-plus people<br /><br />At the end, I felt profoundly sad, as if I had known Jobs personally; I had a tear in my eye.  Well done, Steve Jobs!ut the fact that Apple's iTunes software for Windows computers was extremely popular, Jobs said: \\"It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell.\\"    He did it with strategic thinking. Jobs began a whole new concept: the computer as a hub for all your digital activity [music players, video recorders, cameras, video players, TV].    He did it ignoring the experts who said that the Apple retail stores would be a flop. The Apple stores average annual revenue per store was $34-million in 2010; they accounted for only 15% of Apples revenue; and they created priceless buzz and brand awareness and helped boost everything the company did.    Apple's Fifth Av store, open 24/7, grosses more per square foot than any store in the world. It also grosses more in total -- absolute dollars, not just per square foot -- than any store in New York. That includes Saks and Bloomingdale's.    And all the experts said those Apple retail stores would be a flop. The Apple Store is the best store in the Maine Mall. It might even be the best store on Fifth Avenue, down the street from Tiffany's.    He did it emphasizing beauty. When you take your iPod out of the box, it is so beautiful that it seems to glow, and it makes all other music players look as if they had been designed and manufactured in Uzbekistan.    He did it by deep focus on details. Designing the iPad, Jobs demanded that it signal that you could grab it with one hand, on impulse. So he gave the bottom edge a slight rounding, so that you'd feel comfortable just scooping it up rather than lifting it carefully.    And now it's all over. Can any of you fathom how fast it all happened?! Prior to 1975 no one in history had ever typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer's screen right in front of them. Can you believe that never happened up to 1974, ever?    As he was dying of cancer, he looked back: \\"Hewlett and Packard built a great company, and they thought they had left it in good hands.But now it's being dismembered and destroyed. It's tragic. I hope I've left a stronger legacy so that will never happen at Apple.\\" I hope so, too.    Jobs' half-sister, Mona Simpson, wrote an astounding eulogy which was published in the NY Times. You must read that now. [...]    I'm fully bracing myself for the company to drop its quantity and quality of innovation; so we must cherish the products that are currently being produced -- anything beyond that is a matter of crossed fingers. Bill Gates said: \\"The integrated approach (Jobs' approach) works well when Steve is at the helm. But it doesn't mean it will win many rounds in the future.\\"    I love him for: \\"if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It's my job to be honest.\\" His was the quality of honesty that set the stage for a historic gathering of A-plus people    At the end, I felt profoundly sad, as if I had known Jobs personally; I had a tear in my eye.  Well done, Steve Jobs!

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I downloaded and played this game on my Kindle Fire HD. The graphics were excellent and the storyline wasn't bad. I saw reviews complaining about not having a pinch to zoom feature. It has it now for the main scenes but not for the find the differences scenes ... and you really need it there. The music starts to get boring as does the fact that you end up looking for many of the same objects in different scenes. One thing that's very annoying is the sensitivity of the screen. Regardless of how gently you touch to move the scene when zoomed, it thinks you're touching an object (sometimes you find an object accidentally!). An interesting feature is the addition of scenes that are dark and you have to use a flashlight. However, when you you're zoomed, it doesn't know whether to move the scene or the flashlight ... very frustrating. Another thing I didn't like was the nearly constant use of silhouettes for the missing objects. Some of them are nearly impossible to find that way. Finally, on the higher levels you may want to turn off the timer if you want to get through them (especially the rearranged pictures of the dragon.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the 3D King so far. How much more advanced will Cameron get with his planned next two sequels
1451695195|4.0|Very interesting subject matter.  It is not written as well as I hoped but it got its message across. Anyone with an interest will find it to be an important read.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|It was a very cute movie! Would consider purchasing it to watch over and over again.  Beautiful voices by all the actors.

B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Holmes and Watson pursue Moriarty across Europe to prevent him from starting a world war and ending civilization as we know it.  This relatively straightforward plot-line provides the pretext for a series of rip-roaring adventures on trains, in deserted factories, at an ambassadors' ball and culminating in a cliff-hanging ending over the Reichenbach Falls.  The script is engagingly tongue-in-cheek, with Robert Downey jr's Holmes and Jude Law's Watson forming an ideal partnership: Watson always wants to branch out on his own but finds himself unable to,  Jared Harris makes a plausible villain, his smooth vowels contrasting with Holmes' precise, clipped method of delivery.  I thoroughly enjoyed this version: not exactly a pastiche but more of an homage to the Conan Doyle books.
1117994112|2.0|I purchased this book for my daughter who teaches French and enjoys reading books in French. With the release of the movie Les Miserables, I felt this would be perfect. I was disappointed to find out that this was only part of the story and I haven't been able to find the rest of it on Amazon so far. I also think it would be helpful if it was advertised as the first part of three and gave the list of the other two parts so I could have purchased them at the same time.
1449408656|5.0|I follow the cat vs. human tumblr, and love everything posted there, so I wanted a more solid form of it I could just flip through anywhere. This solves that! Thanks Amazon
1608871452|5.0|This book is amazing. So much eye candy I cant stand it. They have posters and sticker and postcards and just everything you could ever want. I suggest buying 2 just to have back up its THAT great. Its great for the coffee table but i might salt and burn anyone who dare touch it!! A truly beautiful book!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Hard to stop watching episode after episode!!  What will we do when we catch up to the current episode and run out of episodes to watch?????
B005LAIGRS|1.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />Safe House (2012) is just a typical action movie of the present day.  Very predictable.  Before watching this movie, I asked my nephew what it was about.  After he told me, I said, \\"Now let me guess...there's going to be gunfire galore, fistfights, high speed chases down streets and freeways, lots of reckless driving, car crashes, and a passenger in the car is going to try to take over the wheel and has to fight the driver in order to get control of the car.\\"  The movie started.  Everything I predicted came true.  This is just a predictable action movie of today.  If you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This movie has a thin plot as well.  It doesn't matter who's playing the lead role, Denzel Washington or the man on the moon.  It doesn't matter.  It's just mindless action and violence that we've all seen thousands of times before.  Now, I like action movies, but so many of them are all the same.  The only ones I watch are the very best ones.  I always ask myself how much of this stuff do I really need to watch because it's all the same, just a different movie title and different actors.  Another thing about this movie is that the camerawork is horrendous.  It reminds me of camcorder movies like The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc.  The camera always moves left and right, up and down, zigzagging, etc. even while the subject being filmed is sitting stationary, such as a person sitting in a chair.  Horrible.  A lot of the action/fight scenes remind me of some of the fight scenes in The Dark Knight (2008).  Poor editing.  Poor camerawork.  You can barely see what's happening on the screen.  Not that it matters in Safe House.  The Dark Knight as a movie, however, was cool.<br /><br />My recommendation:  If you like mindless run-of-the-mill action movies, this might be your cup of tea.  If you don't want to see a run-of-the-mill action movie, then steer clear of this dreck.er clear of this dreck.

1579128149|5.0|Of the three books I received in this particular shipment, I opened this first. Not just 'cause it was the biggest and therefore coolest.. *averts eyes* I LOVE it! The pictures are so cool and it's just so beautiful and.. *nerdgasm*

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Liked the book, loved the series.  The last book seemed to be a little too long, but that's just my opinion.  Not long as in too many pages, but long as in drug out.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The concept is great! However, the sound is almost as if its muffled. I have had this for a little over a month and would much prefer it be out of the case unless we're out on the water.

B0000669JL|5.0|We purchased this CD for our daughter's Christmas present.<br />Because She requested Bob Marley's CD. We were a bit surprised even she knew Bob Marley.<br />But she was very excited to get this and she loves this CD very much.<br />As long as she is happy with this CD, we'll be very happy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Loved this on the PC - glad it's available here and a really nice FAOTD Christmas gift from Amazon - thanks! :-)

B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is great for people of all ages can not wait to read the third. I have heard that it is just as good.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am an avid fan of the series and felt the limited edition boxed set was a excellent deal for the money. Worth every penny!<br />I've watched it several times since receiving it a few weeks ago.  It was nice to see the portions of the series that were<br />edited out of the PBS broadcast.  Those scenes--though brief--were like nuances; they fill in the little gaps that help you to better understand the characters and their stories. Also enjoyed the special features explaining the historical background of the period and the culture.  I feel this is some of the finest television I've seen in years.  Eagerly awaiting the airing of Season 3 in January in the US and the DVD release on January 29th!

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|As soon as my gra ndson opened this package he jumped up and put it right in the player and he and his toddler brother  both sat down and watched it.  They love.....it.

B005K2YTG4|5.0|I bought this product for my kindle paperwhite. I'm very pleased but was hoping that I would be able to put my kindle fitted with a jacket cover into the sleeve. This product is a little misleading that it doesn't tell you the dimensions but with a little homework on Timbuk2's website I found that this is an XXS sleeve measuring 8x6. Hopefully that helps everyone out a bit. I just ordered the sleeve for the iPad hoping it will work for me. You can also custom make a sleeve for you device on Timbuk2's website, I may be doing this in the future. =)
B009MO57H6|5.0|Are we not just viewing these purely to see Milla? Reviewers did not care much for the lack (?) of plot in Ultraviolet either, but it is all about one pretty lady here.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It was a real success!  Wanted to watch it immediately, but needed breakfast more!  Thanks heaps Also purchased the Dream Fairy earlier on, for my grandaughter - what a surprise.  Loved it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Enjoyable book.  Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the Mortal Instruments series.  Then I will probably read other books by Cassandra Clare.
1439156816|4.0|As a writer, this book helped me get over the unspoken demand for literary greatness, and focus on telling a good story. It also helped me develop characters and situations, rather than plotting out their responses ahead of time on some giant grid. Reflecting on King's ideas helped me find a more satisfying -- and more productive -- writing experience.
B006O3MU96|5.0|This game is really fun, and looks great. The game is not just the regular excellent doodle jump with more Christmas skins. Nope, the game is fun, and addictive. A really great must of for people of all ages.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Discs were in great shape as advertised, case has seen better days and might not be the original, but I have plenty of extra double cases so it was perfect!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|its ok, but, I would appreciate it if you did not have to use money. an FYI before you buy.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|After having high hopes from the first installment, I can say that this movie did no disappoint me.  I failed to see it when it first came out, but purchased it for Black Friday 2012 and quite enjoyed it.  Just as clever as I expected.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I savored every page of this book, sad when I got to the last page. I will definitely be getting the second installment in the series, The Wise Mans Fear.
B005QUQP76|2.0|I got this mouse as a second try to use a gaming mouse.  Will give 2 stars due to a couple of factors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Is very accurate and has nice settings in software.<br />I could see this thing working for me if it didn't break.<br />Cord is solid, but not stiff and restrictive of mouse.<br />DPI adjustment to 3 preset DPI settings on top of mouse.<br />Fits nicely in hand and seems to track well, although I did not have time to really dial it in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Scroll wheel broke within an hour of use.  Maybe it was broken before I used it?  Wobbled to the right and would not scroll up.<br />Sniper button is way to far up the mouse as others have said.  Useless unless you either have humongous hands or you place the back of the mouse against your wrist or you curl up your first 2 fingers while playing.  With your two fingers on the left and right mouse buttons as you would expect, your thumb does not reach the button.  Maybe by design????  Otherwise can't figure that one out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My seven year introduce me to this game. I played it one day and could not stop playing it. Now me and my seven year battles.
B0006J28BO|5.0|Discs were in great shape, case wasn't but it was listed that way, and since I have access to replacement cases it was perfect!
034580404X|5.0|It sucks you in so you have to read then whole series. Don't buy just one buy them all or you will regret it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie!!! The underlying plot may not be original, but it's a very funny movie that is definitely worth watching. And, it's better than 95% of the other crap that comes out these days.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It helps to keep track of my battery life and shows me what I can use and for how long.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game love to play very additive love the graphics and the movie fun for adults too enjoy too much
044024630X|4.0|As usual, I finish a reacher book strangely satisfied but uneasy. How can I like the excessively ruthless guy? But then, what he does is so logical after the fact. I guess that's it. So, now I know where he came from and how he became who he became. It's a typically good military copy thriller—the best of it's genre (which I basically find boring).
141659521X|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly. I bought it to take on my recent cruise and it filled much of the time while relaxing and reading.<br />This was better written than his last book.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This was  amazingly the best virtual English dictionary.it gave me so much information about words and their meanings I really enjoyed it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I is a great book to read at night. we learn about the spirt of God and his son Jeasus.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Cute storyline, and a nice twist on the traditional love story. I'm happy we were able to add it to our Disney collection. It is a little scary at times, so I don't recommend it if your child gets frightened easily.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game love to play mad that it erased when I had to redo my kindle now I start over
0761169253|5.0|I am a struggling artist and I love, love, loved his suggestions as well as absolutely relating to and agreeing with everything he wrote.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this series! I enjoy that era in history anyway, and this sexy cast does not disappoint. A provocative look at King Henry VIII and his wives. Intrigue and seduction; travesty and treason (alleged treason in some cases).<br />I am so glad that I got the entire set so I can enjoy every tumultuous moment!
B005LAJ16I|3.0|I was expecting non-stop action and intrigue. It's rather slow and drawn out. Im glad that I only paid $10 because I wouldve been pissed if I paid a penny more. Its entertainment and I am now invested to see what happens in season 2, but again, I will not be paying full price for this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun, addictive, mind challenging game. love it!! it is very easy to sit and play for hours.  good game to pass the time.  unlike some games.....this one makes you use your brain!!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The guy playing batman is just not believeable as the caped crusader. And the Alfred role is not very good either.
B005HSL626|5.0|My family and I really love to play this game. My three year old is a pro at this game.
B009LRE040|5.0|Fantastic movie!<br />Every moment was done with the same amount of expertise as the previous movies. I found that it definitely lived up to the hype, with only a few nit-picky moments, with only &#34;minor&#34; characters not exactly having the best acting.<br /><br />I recommend it to any fan of the series.
B0031RSA24|5.0|I feel that this book should be required reading for everyone over the age of 18.  An open mind is required.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We like the series so much we have viewed them twice and can't wait for season three. Some of the scenes with Maggie Smith are so exquisite, we watch them over and over.
B000002U6E|4.0|I have heard about enigma since 2001, and i loved that music. Mistic, Softly, very relaxing songs, like a mantra. I indicate that for everyone that like mistical songs, from orient.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie probably won't win any awards, but it was funny, light-hearted, and I loved the music.  Anna Kendrick was great, and Rebel Wilson is always hilariously perfect.  I enjoyed it.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Abercrombie builds this book on the characters of previous ones and brings in new ones that make us hope for future books. Some live, others die, others dissapear. You can never be sure who will survive, or who's time is over. Some scenes had excessive \\"Indiana Jones\\" parts to them, it seems a certain amount of pages had to be reached? That is why my review is only 4 stars. If Abercrombie left some of those out, he would be 5 stars every time. Not his best, but of the best you can find in fantasy writing these days. I strongly recommend it.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've seen this movie several times. But if I really like it, I want to own it. Have not watched it yet, but I will.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Today marks the forth(NOW FIVE)consecutive year I have watched Christmas Story (no,no,no, not \\"you'll shoot your eye out\\" A Christmas Story, but Christmas Story a beautiful foreign film) on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.<br /><br />Every so often I am surprised by a film and 'Christmas Story' is just such a film! The story of old Saint Nick told from Finland perspective is a marvelous story that is sweet, but never sappy and really belies the whole Holiday film clich&eacute;.<br /><br />The story of Santa Claus is told as if we are watching a biography. The film gets my highest 5 star rating, but the DVD gets one star deducted for sloppy dubbing and no original language option. The film would have been better if it ended about a minute sooner too. The shot of the spirit Santa Claus driving off in his sleigh just seemed out of place in this otherwise very engrossing and heartwarming film. I know, I know...it's a \\"holiday movie\\", but this film is so much more than that and I think it would have spoken louder and been more profound had it showed us a little less.<br /><br />This is a small grievance and the film will be in my yearly holiday viewing repertoire for years to come. The film runs about an hour and 20 minutes and shows you don't have to have an overly long film to develop characters or tell a complete story! If you like Christmas films (and I know you do!) this is one holiday film that should not be missed!<br /><br />Happy Holidays to everyone!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!
B004N66XYE|5.0|The first two episodes were interesting. Not as good as Downton Abbey, but it grew on me the more I watched. The problem for me was that I did not find a single appealing character.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I never realized that France was involved in deporting Jewish people to death camps.  This was especially distressing concerning the thousands of innocent children.  Of course, all of this would not have happened without the fear the Nazis generated.  This is a very touching novel that balances the past WWII atrocities with the present life of Julia, a reporter, who slowly uncovers the truths of the past as her own life unravels before her.<br />  V.W.

B0035FQ1UU|3.0|The best thing about this movie is the song Time for Miracles brilliantly sung Adam Lambert during the ending credits...a gorgeous song worth checking out, it was originally written by the songwriter Natasha Shneider and her husband Alain Johannes near the end of her life. It's a sentiment that will outlast the Mayan theme, obvi, and Adam Lambert's phenomenal range and power does it justice.
B001LF347E|5.0|Very high quality with a great picture and sound. The Merlin stories are always great entertainment and fun as well as interesting.
0345529057|5.0|after catching the game of thrones series on hbo, i wanted to start on the books and coincidentally this was going on the cheap. at least alot cheaper than my local bookstore.<br /><br />as for the content itself, there are already hundreds, if not thousands, of book reviews on the ice and fire series. it differentiates itself from the other fantasy fictions such that it is filled with intrigues, brutal yet believable depiction of human motivations and desires, battle of wits and tongues, and...<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />people die, many and often.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Movie kept stopping. Didn't get to enjoy the movie. Wish it would have been better. Don't know if I will keep my prime account. Hope other movies will work.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I had seen an excerpt of this on YouTube over a song I was listening too: Il Mondo by Patrizio Buanne.  I just had to see the whole film.  Loved it.<br />Very fast delivery to my home, too.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I went and saw the movie first, was a wonderful story, the book has more details, but they did a really good job, with the effects in the movie, kind of gave me faces when I read the book.
B007VT6QSI|3.0|The DVD is not very good the sound and picture does not match on all of the clips. We have not tried the cd yet
B000SEGEKI|4.0|This is a short book (A Book Apart length) that I could probably re-read every year on my journey from pretending to be a programmer to actually being a proper one. It didn't teach me to program anything, but I'm sure that it's planting seeds for better programming habits and cultivating a positive attitude to programming.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I listened to the samples provided on this page and wasn't really impressed, but the album went on sale so I went ahead and purchased it since I liked her previous album and was very pleasantly surprised!  It's really grown on me and I've been obsessed with certain tracks (particularly \\"My Blood\\", \\"Figure 8\\" and \\"JOY\\") for the last week.  The album is worth it just for those tracks!  I still need to give the rest of the album more attention though, I'm certainly not saying the rest isn't worth it!
034580404X|5.0|This series was VERY powerful.  I guess you could get caught up in the sexual nature of these books, but the characters were enthralling and the story absorbing. I have read all three books twice through now. I felt like I KNEW these people.<br />Thanks for getting it to me as quickly as you did.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Just downloaded this game to the kindle and I love it. So far it plays really well no glitches. Diner Dash plays really well also even better than on the pc,in my opinion.
B005BHNCO8|4.0|It's about what I expected, but still I'm impressed for the price what you get.  It's fine for the occasional use, everything seems quality enough that it won't just fall apart, but will break if you ham-fist something.  Everything is really light which is nice, and the bag is a little oversized so you can throw in other items so everything is all in one place.
1608871452|5.0|This is most definitely a very nice, top-quality collectors book. It's very large and filled with surprises! This book makes a nice addition to our collector shelves.

1419705849|5.0|Middle-schoolers will revel in this continuation of the misfit saga. Such stories prove that reading can be enjoyable, entertaining and fulfilling.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for a family night! It has enough content to keep the adults entertained as well as enough fun to keep the kids engaged.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Hook is one of my favorite movies from my childhood and the transition to BluRay has been a smooth one.  Great movie.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Well conceived, crafted and delivered.  My expectations going in were looking for something like &#34;how to train your dragon&#34; but this was a coming of age for a pretty, cleaver, charming, precocious and strong personality.  Watching Brave mature and make right choices felt good.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is an awesome CD! It took me a few times of listening to it before I really started to love it, now it's played on loop in my car. It's my go to CD. Buy it and give it a real chance and you will love it too.
B008J2GAKU|4.0|Greatness...Great at, great story...and Batman man smashing fools as always. Awesomeness. Granted I haven't read any batman yet that I haven't liked, this is most definitely in my top 3 ( along with Hush series and Venom)<br />Check it out, man
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Really good!!!! Amazon have the best prices ever and music selection is awesome. Purchase music or anything else is so easy and great experience and all time
0812984412|5.0|Cloud Atlas is the most amazing book I have read in years.  I bought it after seeing the movie which is also amazing and so deserving of all the awards it isn't going to be nominated for.  Following six stories taking place from the early 19th century to two times in the future, it is complex, well-constructed so you don't get lost in the complexity, and beautifully written in six very different styles and languages (all different versions of English so don't panic).  I bought the book so that I can read it closely and follow threads through the six different stories.  It will be with me a long, long time.  I can't think of a book I would recommend more highly.
B000W91RUG|3.0|The show it self is one the the funniest ive seen. The only beef I have with this season is, the video quality was painful for the first few episodes.
B0010SKSTO|3.0|Provided useful information on nonverbal tells. Lacking slightly on qualitative and quantitative backing for some of his claims. Other than that a decent read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Can't stop watching! Awesome show!<br />I just started watching season three and got hooked. So glad I did cause now I am caught up!
B0098VYKSA|4.0|The characters and special effects are amazing.  Kristen Stewart is mostly silent in this film, which can be a good thing, but makes you forget the sugary sweet Snow White from Disney.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written and easy to follow. I was pleased to discover that the book is nowhere near as graphically violent as the movie. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
0525953728|5.0|Got one for my brother also.  My son took several paperback versions with him on his deployment for his friends.  SUPPORT YOUR TROOPS!
1401232590|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She really loved it!  It is exactly what she was expecting.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|This movie is a fun, new look at the Snow White literature.  A perfectly modern storyline, set in a very cool and imaginative world.  The last quarter of the movie might be a bit predictable but definitely worth watching and owning.
B006O6EOII|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and was happily received. My grand daughter just loves these kind of dolls. I may buy more of them
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Beautiful scenery, keeps you entertained. Could be thought of as more of the same spy movie but had enough twists for me.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Have been a fan of Christian Bale since Physo. This movie was GREAT!!!! lots of action.  Hope there will be another Bat Man movie with Christian Sexy Face Bale.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|good effects, fun and action.  That's all I have to say, but I need 8 more words to submit -
B008G12ERC|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and myself.  We are huge Muse fans, and we were not disappointed.  Awesome!
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first released.  At that point I had just read the entire trilogy and was disappointed by the changes made and the lack of depth.  However I just watched it again the other day and once you forget all the book specifics then you will also enjoy it.  If you can suspend your knowledge of the book series you'll love this movie.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|We did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as we did.  The story was very good and it's locale added to its impact.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Through predictable the action packed movie was great, i like it. The ending was something more disappointing. Wondering was the next movie will be like.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|it's slim, light, and well made.  good deal for the money . I'm careful with my things and I think this cover Will last me for some time . have not had any problems with standing it up . no problems with recharging my Kindle either . I just lay it flat open on my desk to plug it in .  I'm very glad I chose this and recommend it.
B007I0WWEW|5.0|I have been a fan of Roxette's since they put out the first CD. Keep them coming, this is one of their best!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She really loved it!  It is exactly what she was expecting.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|I love that vinyls are making a comeback.  This particular album is amazing to listen to on a turntable.  The original track listing and the fun scratchy-fuzz noise from the turntable make this a perfect pairing.  Plus it came with pictures of The Beatles and a huge fold-out lyric poster with pictures of the gang.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The kids love this game and it keeps them entertained for hours..I even enjoy playing it when the kids are not..
B004YM6JI2|5.0|i love the show great price on dvds. love the show so much i bought a 67 four door impala
B009MF56GC|5.0|this movie is a great the action is fantastic and the story is great it brought a lot of actors together to make an all star cast action movie great
B00962341U|5.0|This was a Great New CD by Leona Lewis! This is a must for all her fans.The best Cd yet! A+++++
0060734191|5.0|I love this author. These books are amazing and I would recommend them for both adults and teens. Very imaginative, exciting, lovable characters, just the right amount of scary, and very suspenseful.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|It's a great story about infiltrating Hitler.  The action from beginning to end is meant to capture the ruthlessness practiced to gain control over a population.  Entertaining definitely not to be watched with children in the room.  Enjoy.
0736083863|3.0|The actual explanations of the exercises are not really that easy to follow and they have changed the names from the mat exercises that Rael Isacowitz usually uses so it is hard to cross reference his other books.
B009MF56GC|5.0|We had purchased the first one, and thought that we would complete the set.  Enjoyed seeing all of the older action actors together:-)
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|the picture and sound quality are amazing this movies are even better than before instant classics with a fantastic story
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always writes leaving the reader wanting to read more. Excellent modern day author providing good reading and great movie material.
140053271X|5.0|This was the first time I have used Amazon for electronics, and I was not disappointed!<br /><br />The Nook was a gift for my Freshman daughter, and she loved it...thanks!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie is captivating from the beginning.  The elements brought together, from futuristic to nature, love, and hate all wonderfully done.  Let the games begin!
B000WQW988|1.0|Got this disc for my husband for christmas, it was new And sealed in plastic,  but when opened the disc was cracked and cannot be played!  Sucks
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Clint Eastwood has always been gruff and opinionated,and he was no different in trouble with the curve.Amy and justin were very good for the movie and I liked the ending
0385523912|5.0|this book was very sad North Korea does not see the problems that are depicted in a book as problems but as ordinary lives great ready but very sad
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent book. Really enjoyed it.  My father suggested it and then my husband read it in 2 days so I had to give it a try.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Almost good for the whole family. Gets a little graphic, no more than a CSI show. Great concept for a story. Lots of hi tech goodness albeit already dated by today's current technology. Good action with a purpose not senseless violence or vengeance.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Good story line with action younger children can enjoy.  The digital copy is always a must have for traveling entertainment.
B0015AARJI|1.0|purchased and once opened tried to use it...doesnt work and had thrown out packaging..would not purchase online ever again.the main problem was top right button doesnt work
B009MCRHH6|5.0|2D Boy is one of the success stories that fuel the dreams of many independent game developers. As the story goes, two talented people, the &quot;tech dude&quot; and the &quot;art dude&quot;, hang out in various local coffee shops, cranking out a brilliant masterpiece on their laptop computers. The game is an instant success, bringing the two a vast fortune and the respect of their peers.<br /><br />The reality is, well, pretty much exactly that. Especially the part about &quot;brilliant masterpiece&quot;. Sure there was a much longer and more complicated development story, with more people involved, but ultimately &quot;World of Goo&quot; is still the vision of two very talented people. To their credit, the big studios have produced some genuinely enjoyable games, but as fans of &quot;indie&quot; games are quick to point out, big budgets are strongly correlated with low-risk variations on an established theme. If you're looking for something new, it's often found in coffee shops, on laptop computers, amidst people who are ling on ambition and short on experience. It's often nestled amongst more than few flaws and rough edges, but it's new, and when it works well (enough), I love it.<br /><br />You may have noticed that I haven't written anything about how the game works. Don't worry about that yet. It's better to let the game itself tell the story &amp; surprise you. Just take a look at all the glowing ratings, check the price, and give it a try. &quot;World of Goo&quot; is one of the best games ever made. Seriously. Don't expect it to be perfect, but trust that it's worth the price. Now go play it.
B005LAII9O|5.0|very good movie lots of action the plot is also very good and the cast is also great Oliver stone delivers every time
1451638450|5.0|Like other fans of the series, I wondered what I was getting in a Vorkosigan novel without Vorkosigan.  But the plot develops quickly and Bujold's characters continue to shine as they develop new wrinkles.  Ivan has been a mostly humorous character in the past.  The humour is played down here (although not entirely) and the sense of frustrated romance is played up. This has a similar feel to A Civil Campaign and Winterfair Gifts.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0062086529|5.0|So love this book. Bought it for my three month old step baby to grow into. His eyes track the purple line!
B0029SCFE0|1.0|I watched this movie twice as I thought maybe i missed the point of the movie,I thought with so many rave reviews of this move,as to how good it was and what a masterpiece of a movie it was LOL,maybe I missed something? maybe I need to be high or drunk to enjoy it? I would not say it was the worst movie I ever watched but its a long long way to be a great movie,it was not scary or disturbing,the movie is in the same class as the ring or the blair witch project,it is too convoluted and unconvincing to be a good movie,a waste of time.
B00AMS38YU|1.0|This was a true disappointment. I was so looking forward to a movie with a bit of bike culture in it. Do not waste your money. Instead hit the streets yourself.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|If you're looking for 'Halo: the movie' that got canned long ago.<br />Halo: Forward Unto Dawn, is a side story focusing on Tom Lasky, a character of importance in Halo 4. Taking place shortly after first contact with the Covenant, the focus of the movie is the characters (Lasky and the other cadets in his squad) and the bonds they make as they train to become soldiers -It is very similar to the Halo graphic novels in this respect.<br /><br />Forward Unto Dawn, is surprisingly good (special effects, art, direction, acting) considering this is an indie movie.<br /><br />The movie is available to view on Halo Waypoint (and youtube), however if you want a hard copy, the Blu-ray is the one to get. Also, it also comes with a decent amount of bonus features.<br /><br />If you are a Halo fan this movie was made for you.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|this isa great collection to own i had not seen any of them and all three movies were terrific great story
0606259090|1.0|I enjoy the one paperback book I received for $18 (eighteen dollars plus). I expected the trilogy (3 books) \\"Fifty Shades of Grey (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (50 Shades Trilogy)\\" as Amazon advertised.  Again, I only received one paperback.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Chosen after discovering I like several of the songs from the album.  Fun to sing along to.  Unique style.  Good beat.  Some parts are not suitable for young ears but other than that I would recommend it to anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I like how the book gives each of the characters a scene about themselves. I also like Riordan having Annabeth make her own journey, apart from the group. I would recommend this book to any Rick Riordan fans, or to people who just like the Percy Jackson Series, The Kane Chronicles, or The Heroes of Olympus series.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I like it , lots of options. A great community full of awesome people with artistic views of the world around them. :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun mini games, game progression is fairly easy and quick, so it&acute;s easy to stay engaged.  Definitely recommended for fans of the show!
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|a fantastic item for any south park lover as well as any monopoly player great for the holidays the game board is also great.
B003YBUSMW|1.0|The wheel feels great and the pedals work great on carpet even. The problem is the steering. I started out with Nascar and when you are going straight the car just veers left. I thought it was the game and setup so I put in Forza Horizon and it was even worse! It's like your driving on ice! Very laggy control to say the least. When you turn the wheel there is some delay and small steering corrections make huge impact which is realistic but its when you recover from a turn it over turns.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Not a bad movie by any means, but it takes itself more seriously than I expected (I expected something more in the vein of &#34;Bring It On&#34;).  Although the music is a focal point, this is really just a young adult/coming of age comedy, mining the popularity of &#34;Glee.&#34;  And there are just enough serious conversations that take place (e.g., between daughter and father about why she pushes everyone who cares about her away), to give the film a cheese factor that goes beyond the vocal performances, some of which are very good, particularly during a &#34;riff off&#34; in the quad earlier on in the film.  But as the movie goes on, the acappella performances get harder to sit through.  And then there's the cheese factor associated with a running gag having to do with vomit.  The film references &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; -- a movie that takes place at a high school, but with a script sophisticated enough to be appreciated by adults.  This is not the case with &#34;Pitch Perfect,&#34; but it's entertaining nonetheless.
B007HO392S|5.0|I bought this for a coworker for Christmas. She let me listen to it and now I want to get it too.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Snappy, clever dialogue, but hard to believe that it would come out of a teenager's mouth.  Good, quick read that despite the subject matter is not horribly depressing.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|My daughter had this cd.  I liked it so I bought it and have been enjoying it since. Nice Christmas cd
B005MMYBXI|4.0|I really enjoy the setting. I do really think however that graphics are over done. I understand the decay in the soceity needs to come accrossed . I still think that it  could have been accomplished with less graphics. The human imagination should have been regarded.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My fiance and I just started the 30 day shred. We are getting married in June and we both have let ourselves go this last year. We are currently on day 3 and although the workouts are tough, we are feeling great! We already have more energy and are feeling better about ourselves. We are a great motivator for each other we hope for great results! Jillian is a great motivator and this workout is intense, but fabulous.<br /><br />I am a nurse in a cardiac intensive care unit. I don't want to be a hypocrite and look at my patients after they have had open heart surgery and tell them they need to make some lifestyle changes when I haven't done them myself. I always told myself that I would never get to that point but I am heading there and fast. I'm hoping Jillian can help me lose the 3 pants I have gained since graduating nursing school 3 years ago so I can not only better take care of my patients, but be an example to them.<br /><br />I will keep everyone posted on my progress as I continue this journey!<br /><br />1/11/13<br />So, I am 2 weeks in to the 30 day shred. Since I have a history of knee problems I did level 1 for 2 weeks instead of 10 days and I always follow Anita in the exercises. Today started level 2 and although it is super tough, I still feel great!<br /><br />I am not one for weighing myself, but I have gone down one pants size since starting. I love that I am seeing results but I feel even better because I feel better! I work night shift and always seem to be low on energy on my days off...that has definitely changed and I am definitely getting more accomplished on my days off!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This games has way too many advertisements to make it enjoyable. Every time you need to try again another ad pops up and it is over the part where you need to see where the bird is going and it stays there 15 to 30 seconds. Other times ad just pop up and take up the whole screen. I had it on my phone but got so fustrated with the ads I've taken it off my phone.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|This was the only product that I was not satisfied with from Amazon. The second disc of Season 2 skipped. Then I ordered another one and the same thing happened!!! I was so annoyed. I wish they would pull these from inventory so no one else has to go thru the hassle of all this.
0525953728|4.0|Real and to the point. Excellent writing and in-depth coverage of the situation given the circumstances. Action packed. No beating around the bush and/or washing over the rough ends. Not sure I like all the detail being provided from a classified information standpoint. I am old school in that regard. This sentiment keeps me from rating the book any higher than four stars.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I normally don't like to listening to a woman singing but Susan Boyle blew me away.  What a beautiful voice!
B003FSTN52|5.0|I love to see other series, too! I like this drama, however when I received this DVD, one of the disc was damaged... So I asked for Amazon to replace it. I was so surprised they have great service to do it! It was fast and clear. I'm so happy for it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Really neat photo capabilities, too bad no viewfinder, but still pretty nice.<br />Not bad for a simple app. to add a few photos.
0307895475|4.0|Contains all the information you need about Skyrim. With Skyrim being such a huge role playing games this reference guide is a must have. The only thing I don't like about the guide is the print. It is too small and I do use a magnifying glass to read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids Love It!! Jetpacks... Subways... Graphic are Good and Get To Graffiti Without Getting In Trouble From Mom and Dad.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My son recommended this book for me to read and I Loved It. Have ordered and can't wait to read the 2nd book in the series.
B006O6F932|1.0|What an absolute waste of money.  As much as we have had to spend on products for this brand, I am completely disappointed in it.  It is not durable, the snap together pieces either do not snap together or do not stay together for long.  None of the seams line up correctly, the stairs do not snap in place and the top floor bends forward if you decide to put even one doll on it.  The plastic is flimsy and cheaply made and leans in every direction, except for straight up and down like it should.  I remember growing up with mattel toys and still have matchbox cars that look like new, but are over 30 years old.  Maybe if they didn't use cheap foreign labor to build and assemble these toys there would be better results.  I'm tempted to put it out with the trash this Thursday.  COMPLETE WASTE OF HARD-EARNED MONEY!!!!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This did not let down after a great Joker character. Bane was equally impressive. Great story through entire series. Must see.
B008220AVW|4.0|My daughter was very excited to get this movie for Christmas.  I saw it with her in the theater and was very pleasantly surprised!
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Main character seems not very bright, she seems silly and stupid at times. The ending seemed rather abrupt and contrived.
B00005JPFH|5.0|&#34;Two thumbs up! The price, very affordable, the quality, no need to talk about, very clear to my hdtv, over all, a friendly neighborhood item for the customer like me.&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a superbly written book.  I could not put it down.  If you like spy stories with all the twists and turns, this book is for you.
B008M721MS|4.0|like it so far just opened it though.see how it goes did have time to set it up be fore this. taking a few mins. now.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The Adventures of Tin Tin DVD<br /><br />The DVD was sent to my nephew in North Carolina.  Tin, Tin is .very entertaining for children and will keep their interest.<br />.
B000SCHBGQ|3.0|Light, easy read that was enjoyable. It was exactly what I wanted to read when I read it. Perfect young adult magical fantasy type book.
B008F9T76Q|5.0|Good Value for the money - daughter was very happy!  Great Christmas present for a teen novel reader - love the series
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is such a great show! I haven't had the time to watch the bonus features yet, but I'm on the penultimate episode of the second season. So. Flippin. Good. *dies*
B0011XBLV2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's the most iconic Western ever made.<br /><br />If you like movies, you absolutely must see this film.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|\\"the perks of being a wallflower \\" is one of the mot touching books I've ever read, I highly recommend it!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Couldn't of asked for more . Great HD playback . Complete first season . Plus additional black/white intro episode . If you're in for zombies then pick this one up for your collection !
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was confused at the start switching between the character point of views, but as I got to know them and by the end of the book I was hooked on the depth of the characters the realness of them and the life and the richness of detail.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Only allows you to comment on the last 10 or so postings.  I think it's actually better to do this through the net on Kindle Fire rather than use the app.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The guys stripping  was great the story and dialogue was horrible. I really wanted to love this movie and was excited to see it, that quickly went away once the movie started. In other words Magic Mick has no magic
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Threat Vector-<br /><br />A very confusing book, not up to the earlier Tom Clancy (only) books which feature a tightly knit, free flowing, enthralling narrative.<br /><br />I may not bother to finish this, it is like reading a series of news stories written by various reporters with differing points of view.<br /><br />M. Pierce
B00571F26Y|5.0|I starting reading this to see if it could help. Made some changes and I am now now living a new life because of this book. I am amazed how I can live without the migraines that I use to be accustomed to, with the daily medications and Botox shots to help, and the IBS and never realized the connection to wheat. Now after eliminating wheat, they are going away. I'm so excited and happy. It's like being born again. It's not an easy change, and it isn't a cheap change, but it is nice to live whiteout headaches and daily auras.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|great book want to read the original book too was glad I tried this one too though couldn't put it down !!
B002WIDRM6|3.0|The music and lyrics are good, but I just found that all of the songs to be a little more slower paced than the albulm title &#34;Lady Antebellum&#34;. It has nice songs that are worth listening to if you like the band, but not if you just want a taste of who they are.
034580404X|5.0|Showed up earlier than expected and was just as promised! Have not read it yet but can't wait to read it. I have heard great things about it. Merry Christmas.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This movie is one long reenactment of other movies, there were parts I had to fast forward out of boredom. There is no story, perhaps if the took the end of the movie, I mean five minutes before it end and created a story out of that it may not have been half bad. But if are a fan of the others steer clear of this one, no story, no real zombies, no villain and characters who have died in previous movies are back,they should have stopped before they jumped the shark.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I found this movie to be not bad but in between you could say, it has it's moments and stuff but at the same time your kinda wondering really? All and all this may not be for everyone but the role Alice took in this movie is fantastic, while meeting a few characters that are well known from the Resident Evil Franchise.<br /><br />I do however believe they should have waited to bring in Ada Wong into the movie, just because I felt the actor didn't fit Ada. But don't take my word for it but at least I gave it a chance. Leon's character wasn't too bad either. I guess we'll have to see how they finally \\"end\\" this franchise with the next movie.<br /><br />Also it explains very well why most of the older characters are back, so don't think otherwise. It makes complete sense once you watch it rather than \\"assume\\" their alive.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|The first Bond film with Daniel Craig definitely set the tone for and grittier bond which is less light hearted. This movie is no different. What really makes this movie less than a traditional Bond film and less than Casino Royale is the storyline which is rough in some areas and totally unbelievable scenes (building exploding in the desert, machine guns never hitting their targets etc.) (I got that the building was powered by fuel cells).
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It starts to pull up then stops and says, it stopped running!  Frustrated!!!  I need help with this darn thing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is the only Disney movie I have and it was in mint condition when I bought it and it plays excellently. The service was good too. It has an additional song that wasn't in the original. it was an okay song, not one that is memorable. Overall, it was a very good product.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I not crazy about Piano Master.  I really like Magic Piano much, much better.  It's okay but not my favorite.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great DVD! This gift arrived promptly after the order was placed! This is a great edition to my video library!
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|If you want a \\"bottom line\\" summary skip to the bottom:<br /><br />The book is a bit daunting.  It is just over 1000 pages and it doesn't waste much time throwing you into the world.  But here is the thing to keep in mind: when you don't fully \\"get\\" something in a book/series this long, don't get hung up on it.  As mentioned in some other reviews, there is a lot of mention of *blank*-spren and you aren't given anything else to go on to figure out what they are.  So you are left with a name and the context that the spren show up to piece it together.  Some readers seem to want answers as to what things are immediately as they are introduced but half the fun of an epic fantasy series is learning about the world/characters as things unfold.  You learn what things are along with the characters because it is made clear that they don't know what most of the most intriguing aspects of the world are themselves.  What causes the highstorms?  Who were the radiants?  What are spren?  What does it mean to be Truthless?  The point of a book/series like this is to immerse yourself in the world and go along for the ride and Sanderson does this expertly.<br /><br />One review complained that Sanderson jumps around from character to character while you're left trying to figure things out.  I already addressed why you shouldn't worry about trying to figure every little thing out and when he does transition from character to character he never does it at break-neck speed.  The character switches are always done at key moments that leave you wanting to read more and there were several times that I stayed up late reading through a character switch because I wanted to learn more about what the previous character was doing.  By the time I got to the end of the character that interrupted the story I wanted to read more of, I wanted to read more about what happened to THAT character.  By the end of the book some of the characters began to overlap and because of the build up to those points, I couldn't help but get extremely excited to see how they would interact with each other.  If you're still concerned with numerous character shifts, there are really only 4 main characters, one of which only shows up in the interludes between main sections.  The other three characters are the main focus of the rest of the book and their stories are distinct enough that there is no real danger of getting them mixed up or losing track of one of them.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" is a fantastic foundation book for a long series.  Sanderson leaves you wondering about enough while still giving you plenty of character development and world-building to keep you hooked.  I'm excited to continue reading about this world and it's characters.  The bottom line is to not get hung up on wanting every little thing answered as it comes.  If you can't stand loose ends then you shouldn't be getting into a series like this to begin with.  If you're looking for an immersive, expansive, unique world that you can explore along with the characters then you should give this book a shot.I couldn't help but get extremely excited to see how they would interact with each other.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love these book! I have read them three times now and planning on reread them again. I would recommend them anyone.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love how you don't have to depend on neighbors to do certain things or make progressive. it's not expensive but very addictive. Everyone should play
B004P1YX6M|5.0|Technically perfect. And his interpretive take on these compositions approaches profound. He has done wonders in his debut recording. Beautiful.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Got two DVDs of the movie for Christmas. It's a good movie for relaxing. However, it often felt like watching a high school play. The movie ended on a bland note. It did not have the spark that the earlier versions have. I'd give it a three or four, not bad but not great.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|This series was supposed to get better with each installment, but instead took a step backward when they introduced a new character instead of telling was what happened to the last one.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Great songs and a amazing artist. This guy and drake are a power house dream team. You get thirty songs for 3.99 not a bad deal.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is not the latest version because iPad has pink dragons &amp; New Dawn has more dragons but I love this game<br /><br />ADD ME: Rocko04
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Incomparable!  Exquisite presence, voices.  They get better as time goes on.  A remarkable group going on 10 years.  Love 'em!
B00008BRB5|4.0|I had this when it first came out and thought it was ok then. As I'm older now I am looking back at a lot of the music I used to listen to with a fresh perspective. This is one of those albums, enjoy.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I would definitely tell others to read.<br />in the grand scheme of things It felt like it could happen to you or someone you know.

1881273377|5.0|This book/CD has opened my eyes to the differences between myself and my husband and how we look at things.  A must read for every marriage/relationship.

B003CI90MQ|4.0|Very good book for a novice. Not much useful for advanced enthusiasts. Scott explains from in detail everything you need to enter into the great world of photography. He explains the general photography terminology used, basics of camera, suggestions on gear(these are pretty outdated), tips on specific scenarios and general photography tips.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Such a great book I finished it in about 5 hours! I still feel there's something missing at the end though. Like I said, it's almost there
B005LTDPJI|5.0|What a great way to appreciate the development of a great band and the skill of songsmith Jeff Lynne. The remasters sound pristine, and the bonus tracks are gems! Highly recommended even if you've heard these albums in the past.
0938045768|5.0|I have been following the program laid out in the book to the best of my understanding for the previous 22 weeks. I write \\"to the best of my understanding\\" which leads in to the only drawback I can find about it. It is somewhat hard to take instructions concerning body movements from reading. I have found that I need to return and carefully read sections over and over to settle some concern I encountered. I have realized after weeks that I did a particular exercise wrong. Or started on some other which Coach Wade doesn't recommend considering the level I am at. I am pretty sure that always flipping the pages of this book makes me appear a bit manic.<br /><br />I have sometimes been saved that I have had access to some acquaintances at the office that also follow this program. We briefly discuss and compare our understandings, share experiences and also give tips how to rig a good training environment. It is through such discussions I have discovered some mistakes, but also been encouraged to experiment with the exercises. E.g. your grip in horizontal pulls makes some difference. Yet, I have made no mistake in understanding convict conditioning is a solitary practice. And each body faces its own challenges. Socializing around the methods the book teaches aspects is very valuable. But I hope I have been very careful about not turning such discussion into bragging forum, about the level or number of reps I can do etc. I believe I would otherwise risk negatively impact me and my friends' training.<br /><br />Apart from these very minor negatives, my experience is the \\"promises\\" in the book have been fulfilled on every aspect. I have realized that when I started training I was in a poor shape. My body was hurting in numerous ways, mostly from practicing a field sport and also doing unbalanced weight strength training too hard. I have had aches in almost every joint like toes, ankles, knees, calves, back, tennis elbow, right shoulder, thumbs, and fingers. I had even developed a little limp due to my right toe was hurting. Still I deem my muscles and cardio-vascular was in pretty decent shape.<br /><br />Hence I was in desperate need of rehabilitating my body, and at the same time very restless since I deem I had quite a bit of capacity for a person in my age (I'm in my late thirties). I was also facing that my job and my family required more of my presence. I couldn't practice my favorite field sport, nor fit long hours in the gym, not even considering that I have 24 hours access to one very close to where I live.<br /><br />For these reasons the method this book teaches fitted me perfectly. And as I said it has delivered. After only 22 weeks all nagging pains have receded completely. Furthermore I have strength wise surpassed the capacity I had before entering the program. I think this is formidable results considering most of the time I have invested in the program is by doing the entry level exercises. But of course I have also been learned to rest more in between work-outs. I have thoroughly learned that resting is the key in training.<br /><br />I have also recently found that muscles grow on my body. This wasn't really my incentive for starting the training. I don't consider myself vain - the size of my muscles is not something I worry about. But it has recently dawned on me that I grow in a peculiar way. I rarely wear shirt and tie. I have a few that have been hanging in the closet for some years, but very recently find occasions to wear them. The other day I was going to attend a formal Christmas party which mandated wearing a white shirt and tie. To my big surprise I could not do the top button on two out of the three white shirts I own! My neck simply did not fit any longer. The shirts were also too tight cross the chest.<br /><br />But the most peculiar side effect of following the program laid in the book is that I have been forced to change my sleeping habits. After a long life of falling asleep facing the mattress, I now find this extremely uncomfortable. My back complains, but not by feeling painful, it is more of my spine is feeling like a very tight spring. It just doesn't want to be bended - it wants to remain straight. It is only satisfied with me if I am sleeping on my back. But I sleep very well like that.<br /><br />A very similar experience is concerning my work situation. I am an office slave. I am stuck behind my desk for the most of my time. Since I have started to train I have found that sitting is also very uncomfortable. But fortunately my office is equipped with elevatable desks. I have started to use the top position, standing behind the desk for most of the day, and some days only sitting when I am away from my desk during meetings.<br /><br />In summary, in only 22 weeks I have rehabilitated my body and it appears my muscles started to grow so I no longer fit into some of my clothes, and I have adopted healthier habits. I feel deeply satisfied with sometimes making progress in the program and mastering a new exercise. And I feel extremely encouraged by these results I have obtained so far and I expect I will continue my training, flipping the pages of the book for years to come. Bottom line I can deeply recommend the book to anyone reading this review.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn must have been in Clancy's graduating class. Every bit as good, but a more prolific writer. Another good guys wins no matter the cost book. Flynn's only problem is that he can write them as fast as I can read them!
1449410243|2.0|This book was like something for a kindergarten child.  It was put together very vividly a lot of thought went into the quality of the making of the book but not much into the content of it I am afraid.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|The only Idol album I was waiting for. Great guy and artist. Easy to listen to and nice to support a good person.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Great sound, fantastic arrangements and awesome vocals. What more could any fan of ELO or Jeff Lynne want? Give it a listen!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Some funny moments but pretty lame.  The sets are cool but the story just doesn't stand up and it is boring.
B00030DEQE|5.0|It just worked... period. No hassle with the drivers. Just plug the board into the slot and turn on the computer. Win 7 64-bit system.
B0053O89JM|5.0|What can I say?  I love HOUSE I would recommend this and any of the House series to anyone as I love them all.  Great show can watch it over and over and over again.  Truly cannot say this about much of things to watch on TV anymore but highly recommend this.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love the new Sherlock on PBS with Cumberbatch and so was very interested at another modern take of the Sherlock Tales, this time in America.  I rarely watch TV, having only a 2 shows that I currently follow, so I missed the first couple episodes, not knowing when the series started.  With the lovely Amazon feature of being able to buy just an episode, I downloaded the pilot and watched one evening while biking.  I was immediately hooked.  I thought the actors brought forth the known characteristics of Doyle's characters beautifully and that the essense of the novels translated nicely into a modern setting.<br /><br />After watching the episode, I put the series on season pass on my Tivo and have not been disappointed.
B009329Y30|2.0|Very disappointed in this movie. After just reading the book recently there were so many differences. I like a based-on-book-movie to at least follow the book even in the small details like where the story took place...Should have been NC, but in the movie it  was Louisiana. The acting and cast wasn't up to par for me either...Oh well. I really enjoyed the book--the movie? Not so much!
0812416503|1.0|Can you believe it?  A hardback is supposed to be a special edition, not a cheap paperback.  Of course my girlfriend opened her gift to find the pages were cut off along the top.  Hard to believe.
B008M721MS|1.0|Not able to use this app. Trying to talk to family not in this state. This is a headache to try and use
1452110581|4.0|This was a very cute book not maybe exactly what I expected as I expected more.  But it was indeed cute and I liked it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I really liked this movie! It was just the right mix of comedy and drama. It started out a little slow but definitely kept me watching. I found it very timely since I am also a senior citizen. I would recommend this movie to anyone but especially someone over 50.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great story. Easy to read. I'm impressed by the author's understanding of the human nature. The sociological insigth of the book is excelent
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this film.  Great story line, characters & graphics.  The wold family enjoyed it very much.  It was funny, lots of laughter.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Big fan of Phillip Phillips. I liked the album and listen to it frequently. It is a quieter side of this artist with quality products. If HOME is your favorite, you'll love the album. For me, I really liked more of his work that showed the funky side of him, like Superstition. I hope that the people that control his album will give him more artistic license on the next album. He is an artist and if they let him express himself more, everyone will be better for it.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|A truly wonderfully and eye opening book. Certainly worth the cheap price and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read. Maybe I've played to many video games but I didn't read anything that was too gory.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I didn't think I would like the movie as much as I did.  It suprised me. The real people and the animation were so smoothly and seamlessly integrated I was riveted. The colors just popped. It was an incredible experience.  I just sorry I didn't get to see it in a theater with a big screen and surround sound.
B009YQJ322|4.0|I grew up reading the comic book, so I was disappointed when the first movie came out with Stallone.  Compared to the comic it was way too comedic and the acting was way over the top (I am the LAWWWWW!!!!!!!).  Armand Assante's character was even more so.<br /><br />This version is much better.  This Judge Dredd is truer to form in this movie.  He does not say much and just does his job.<br /><br />The movie is action-packed and goes by very fast.  It gets straight to the point and is entertaining.  Be warned though.  The movie is not for everyone due to the graphic violence in certain scenes.<br /><br />Overall, I give it four stars.  I hope they make a sequel.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I got this for my daughter who just had a baby......it's amazing.....sound is great, picture is really clear.... It gives them total piece of mind.....awesome!!!
B0073L91MW|5.0|The movie was excellent and was a part of the history and events that took place during WW II which showed how<br />the Elite forces of the British Military was put together.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I think the game is really fun and action packed I love it BUT I need to know how to update the game so I can fight atom and zues.
1440503257|5.0|A delightful book full of authentic English recipes and some that may have may the house tables at Hogwarts.  If you've never had a treacle tart or tried a bite of Yorkshire pudding, this is the book for you!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and the Blu-ray looks great .The only thing that would make this movie better would have Julie Andrews in the lead part .
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love everything about this app.  It is well worth my time - I can't stay off of it.  I've already made things from it.
0340203161|5.0|1Volume, not what I thought I was getting but the book is the same and I love it. It is a book I have read several times and I love reading it before or after watching the mini series. It definately fills in the gaps. Greatest of the Clavell novels in my bookshelf.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is a great game it allows u two destroy pigs<br />and makes your fingers sore.it  also trains your mind
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I was reluctant to watch this remake.  The big screen reviews were not flattering and I'm a big fan of the original.  Having said this I broke down and rented it.<br /><br />From the start my interested was captured, the visuals are top quality and although the plot is not the same it was still future sci-fi, my favorite.  My worst fear with any remake are cheesy references to the original, however classic lines and scenes were well covered and did not give me that cheese vibe.  I was very surprised and highly recommend this movie even if you are a huge fan of the original!<br /><br />Not 5 starts but I would give it 4.5 if I could.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is a very good movie to have for anybody . The kids and adults .Great collection to have. Love it .
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|good enough for some laughs on a long plane ride! kept me from falling asleep on a 4+ hour ride.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Inferior to previous novels. Did not have the tension. Seemed like the book was written for its own sake and dragged on.
B00001U0DP|1.0|I took a chance on this movie due to all of its good reviews and its star rating. After watching the trailer, I wasn't sure if I'd like it (but thought I'd take a chance anyway because of the reviews/rating).<br /><br />Well, if you think the trailer is kind of silly, then there is a lot more where that came from...the entire movie is like that. Silly, happy-go-lucky, always smiles, always laughter, impossible \\"happy\\" circumstances, silly talk, and more happy happy.<br /><br />Oh yes, it's 1939 and World War II is underway. But never mind that...just more happy happy. It even shows Jewish people taken by train to a camp...shows them wearing black/white striped clothing...but even then...more happy happy.<br /><br />After 15 minutes, I increased the speed of my DVD player to hurry-up the movie (still able to listen to the audio). After 30 minutes, I started to fast forward into the movie to see if it would get serious at all. Nope. At 1 hour into the movie (at the happy happy Jewish camp scene), I decided to turn it off.<br /><br />Maybe this movie is your cup of tea, but it is not for me. I did not find it cute, happy, or entertaining. It's just silliness. Given the era and what was occurring in history at that time, I thought the movie was insulting. I would not classify this movie as a war/military drama (although some websites do).<br /><br />Prior to renting (or buying it), I encourage you to watch the trailers. On youtube, search for: \\"Life is Beautiful\\" trailer. And you can probably find trailers elsewhere on the internet too.<br /><br />The default spoken language is Italian with English subtitles, but you can change the DVD settings to spoken English.<br /><br />Visit my Amazon wish lists to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3DU5CH5ZFWRNI/<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/24H8TDYHFDOET/
B009FB3XTA|3.0|Album gets better after a few songs. Missing The Muse and Paramore in it but still enjoyed it. Added to collection of the Twilight saga.

B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use.  I have not had any problems at all with this app.  I was undecided on whether to download this to my kindle but I took a chance and I really do like the App.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|I was very disappointed in the options and controls. Picsart and photo editor are much better and free. Don't waste your money.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|Perfect modern jazz, intensive, progression and the sound its perfect, for who like the fision and experiment new sound with progressive sounds ,
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever played! GREAT graphics,and wonderful<br /><br />ul challenges. The only thing that I don't like is the cash part of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so cool that had to read it again<br />I love this book and I want to see the movie
030759565X|5.0|Great tasting recipes but easy to make in your kitchen.  Buy one for a friend, they'll thank you...and you'll enjoy the treats!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|UltraViolet doesn't work with iTunes!!! If you're going to sell a digital copy make sure it's at least easily accessible though the most popular digital players. UltraViolet is crap, I will never purchase another BluRay with this format on it again.
0425220931|5.0|Anyone who has heard Victor Wooten speak in person will hear his voice come through in this book.  Beautifully written - and so much more than just a book for musicians.  As a parent of an aspiring bass player, this book hit every note in my mind just the right way.  It allows you to see the world from a positive, accepting place.  Not sure if that was the intent that Mr. Wooten had when writing the book, but the intent is not necessarily going to equal the outcome - and the outcome was stupendous.  I enjoyed reading it as an educator, as a parent, and as a parent of a musician.

0765367351|2.0|The author tried his best to combine the two bioshock games... but it was obvious he had issues.  I also didn't like the way some of the characters where portrayed.  Rather boring.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has become my place to pigeonhole important thoughts, lists, and agendas.  Like a well made rolltop desk, Evernote consistently provides storage in a convenient manner.  It ranks in my top ten necessary apps for all my devices.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great characters, eminently believable psychology and world. Absorbing, well paced, constantly interesting, etc. Just buy it and read it already. And thanks to Amazon for steering me towards it - I had finished everything by David Mitchell, and was in between Haruki Murakami books, and although this isn't as fantastical of a world/storyline (more like Thousand Autumns than Wind-Up Bird Chronicle), the feel is comparably masterful to me.
0802473156|5.0|Very quick and enjoyable read.  The techniques to use are put in layman's terms and a good tool for any relationship.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Im very pleased with the headset for what I bought it for as the gaming end of it is just what they said it was,,,I hear things I never heard before in BF3 and dont think you ever are going to sneak up on me again. The sounds of the choppers,tanks,jeeps,guns,footsteps and anything else in the game have been brought to a level of sound that makes the gaming experience 120% better, not to mention it has made me a better player because I know where everything is in all my surroundings...I was also very impressed with the sound of my music as I listen to pandora regularly, with the equalizer you can make them sound as good as any I have ever had..Equalizer is NOT need in game but is awesome for music...<br />  In all I would reccomend the G930s without any hessitation to gamers or and music lovers who want the best..
B009MCRHH6|3.0|its an alright game but it is defenitly not my favorite game I wouldn't play it all the time but if your really super board them maybe I will play it
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great new artist - great new album!<br />Reminds me of Dave Matthews--music is incredible!<br />Buy this cd you will love it!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Not as good as the first two, I thought, but they took their time telling a long story and it almost seemed like a couple movies in one (and it was actually long enough to do that).  Cat Woman introduction wasn't nearly as terrible as I thought it would be.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I wrote a review about the open ear set, but as far as closed ear, it's better for someone without a huge head, such as a woman's. It's very very comfortable, lots of padding, so even when it loosens over time, there is no discomfort even after hours of use, which is my daily routine. Really good buy for the price. The wire attaching it is sturdy. This was a lot better than ones I've bought for $80. Recommended A+ !
B003TSEL7S|3.0|This book talks a lot about each of the characters, and needed a little more action to keep my attention.  Not riordans best.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|We are very empressed with the streaming video and we are excited to think that we own this video in our video library.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Great Led Zeppelin concert. The band is just as good as ever, and this shows why. Jason Bonham is fantastic!<br /><br />Fantastic price @ $20.<br />I would gladly buy this again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|We all had fun playing this game, even my two boys enjoyed it! A good way to pass some time!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is one of the greatest action hero movies ever. Thor is the man! Would recommend this movie for everyone.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Was so excited to receive these just in time for Christmas. I love that the Blu-ray was cheaper than the regular DVDs.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It cleans out hindering data and apps, allowing my tablet to be faster. Great and intuitive interface allows easy and complete use.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|it may be a little expensive but it is the best and I love it take it from me I love it period.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The best recording we have seen but disappointed that the chandelier does not move up and down.  That was one of the most exciting parts of the stage production we saw in New Orleans.  Surprised the Royal Albert Hall could not accomplish the movement.  Still, I wouldn't trade the recording!  Wonderful trailers and love the extras in the grand finale.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Was so excited to receive these just in time for Christmas. I love that the Blu-ray was cheaper than the regular DVDs.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While it was a fantastic continuation of a great series I believe that George has left far too many loose ends that have only two books left in which to be tied up.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This was a surprise gift for Christmas.  I am not familiar with Kelly Clarkson's music but the recipient was overly excited to have received it.

B005LAII62|5.0|My little brother and sister loved Paranorman, in fact the whole family found the movie to be in good taste. I specially found the movie to be just as entertaining as Coraline but with more comic moments.<br /><br />A good buy.
B005LAII12|4.0|Ted is about an 8 year old boy who wishes his teddybear would come to life.  As the boy (Mark Wahlberg) grows up, he and his best friend, Ted do everything from partying to everyday life situations.  It is raunchy and extremely funny!  If you like the show, &#34;Family Guy&#34;, then you will enjoy the humor in this movie.
B0076DELIG|2.0|This is not what I expect from Connelly.  I almost want to skip the one that is coming out on top of this one, but will wait to see what other people think before buying.
B009T8XBBO|1.0|my device is less than half full and still the app says it doesn't have enough space to properly load it. complete waste of money as I can not play it at all
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very addicting. I cant put this down. I do have one complaint tthough, the faces on the load screen look messed up. but that's just me nitpicking.
B000BVMAJ2|3.0|had already bought the Zoo playset and thought these animals would be smaller than the ones from that set...but they were duplicates...at least they don't fight over them now!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Have owned nearly every version of WoG since it came out (PC, Mac, Linux, Steam, Wii) so now I own an Android version!  Whee!<br /><br />Pros: Great storyline (seriously, there is a storyline, told within the cutscenes of the game)!  Amazingly funny signs!  Physics Gameplay that puts all other physics games to SHAME!  Creative building techniques encouraged by new \\"goo balls\\" that do different things!  And, for today, FREE!<br /><br />Cons: I've never been a huge fan of trying to do precision things in an Android Touchscreen.  This game likes precision, as a slightly mis-placed gooball can spell splattery disaster at the hands of a grinder.  Soon to see how that works.<br /><br />Other: You will learn to love the whistle.  You will learn to hate the corporation.<br /><br />Seriously, goo it up!  Cannot recommend this game too highly.  It's not possible.
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|I give this a 4 stars because it does exactly what it is designed to do.  It shows videos and picture slide shows really well through my tv and up on the big screen at my work in a middle school.  So I often watch my PBS shows or other videos on my big screen instead of just watching it on my iPad.  Also was nice to watch Netflix streaming at parent's house on their tv.<br /><br />What it does not do is mirror everything on your iPad. I did not fully understand that when I bought this product.  I'm keeping it because I enjoy what it does do.  Sounds like I need an Appletv type wifi receiver thing to do that.  So just be very careful that you read the fine print of what it actually does.  I was upset at first because I thought it was broken, just had to actually push play on video for it to work.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|nice game ......... colorful scenes addictive. but sad when you finish the game. got difficult in the middle. my kids love it too
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Having spent 30 years serving my country I can attest that to read this book about the actions of the men of the Special Forces, is refreshing.  I know first hand that the media always gets it wrong in their quest to create a story that incites sensationalism, when it comes to Military Ops. They will do this through rumors & 'facts' that they make up.  So to read a story from someone who was 'there' and knows the facts is fascinating and spell binding.  The book holds your interest from beginning to the end.  It is so well written that you can picture in your mind exactly what the Seals were see-ing and experiencing.  One of the best books I have read in a long time, well done!
B00005LOUP|5.0|Well loved and appreciated, came early in plenty of time as described.  it was a gift for my son and he loved it.

B004GVUPFE|4.0|a very good puzzle solving game that even kids of 5+ could do. uses your brain not shoot and kill and make noise
B008AT71WI|5.0|I love that they FINALLY decided to release this with the fully restored original ending.  What a revelation, and it's amazing to see how much different the film would have been if they stayed with the stage ending.  Video looks great, audio is great to listen to, and I'd recommend this set to anyone who loves the movie.
B000K7VHLY|5.0|i love this. i have loved Romeo + Juliet for so long, i actually keep a collection of vhs, blu-ray and dvd versions and soundtracks and special editions, so I couldn't miss out on this one! one of the things that makes this movie so amazing is the score, it just fits perfectly in every scene,<br />the music edition has a little overview on the choice of music on the movie and how they thought of everything. it's not so different from any other version, but it's still nice. i'm content with it.<br />what i was unhappy about was that mine came in the mail without the cream coloured framing cover over the actual cover. so basically what i got was this dvd, but not as shown on the picture here on amazon. that kinda bugs me out because i think it looks much much nicer on here, while on mine there's only claire danes and leo dicaprio standing with the palm trees behind them, no cute frame or anything. i mean it's kind of annoying that i was expecting something aesthetically different, but i'll get over it.... if you don't care about the lack of a cardboard little cover you should just buy it already :)
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I really enjoyed the original total recall.  And although i like all the actors in the new version its just not as good.  They added a few twists.  If u pick this movie just watch it as a totally new film not a remake and you will enjoy it more.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A total page turner! My only regret is I either read too fast or the book was way too short. Clancy needs to step up his game and be more prolific with his output, as long as he doesn't sacrifice the quality of his work. Otherwise, keep us thirsty for more!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most amazing game ever thank goodness this game was made because if it wasn't I would be bored every single day. And a shout out to the person who made this you are awsome.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like this game allot! It's very entertaining, but the gameplay can sometimes become repetitive. Play scarcely for the most enjoyment in small bursts.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|Before getting into why this movies sucks i will first say this.I have seen all 3 movies in the series,the first was good although it focused more on story than action but it was i guess an introduction of the transformers for people that might not have watched the cartoon.Part 2 was in my opinion decent,there were things that i didn't really care for like the cornball comedy also Devastator what purpose did he serve? & Optimus Prime coming back to life and not only damaging Megatron but also defeating The Fallen so quickly,it seemed to me that the ending was rushed..Now on to this piece of crap,the reason why this film sucks is because it focuses more on the human element than it does on the actual robots.I also think that some of the actors in the film served absolutely no purpose in it except for making it longer and more tedious to watch.The special effects in certain parts particularly towards the end look downright clunky.I found the part where the soldiers are either flying or glding through the air hard to swallow as well and since when do transformers get taken out by humans? Sam taking out Starscream at the end of the film pissed me off! Cmon man if Starscream had to die at least let him get taken out by an Autobot not a puny human..I think Michael Bay or whoever the hell directs the next one (Really? another one as bad as this one was?)Needs to take this in a different direction because to me this series of films just keeps getting worse.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|MORE THAN I EXPECTED, AND FREE! Not yelling, just happy. Had much more useful info than I had expected :-)
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This sim is about the best flight sim I've seen for Android.<br />I downloaded it as FAOTD but then kept it in the cloud because I also downloaded something huge.<br />Now I tested it and cannot confirm it's upside down on my Kindle fire.<br />Also, I don't understand the complaints about hard controls - there are tutorials and the controls are easy : thrust is the lever on your left ; on the lower right are landing gear, flaps and brakes - if you want to stop when you land use those brakes and have the landing gear down, please.<br />The one problem I noticed is that it sometimes does freeze, especially when using the turboprop planes.<br />It still gets five stars for being a flight simulator that feels authentic.<br />If you think it's too sluggish just adjust control sensitivity and see how fast this baby reacts.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Best Xmas movie I've ever seen, hands down! For a kid who grew up in Boston watching Flash Gordon, it doesn't get much better than this. Too funny!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Although, &#34;unlimited&#34; streaming only refers to the fact that you can do as much you like, not unlimited in the sense that everything is open to you. Even at $1.99, it was worth not going to the redbox in the cold to check availability on a brand new release.<br /><br />Good HD picture, Good Audio. 2 hours and 45 minutes of runtime - no glitches after the first 30 seconds of buffering.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love this show. It is laugh out loud funny. There are very few shows that I will watch over and over. This is one of them!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This movie really should not have been made. It totally made the first one look bad. Some of the worst acting
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great novel and I'm very interested in reading more from Quick. Saw the movie first and I appreciate both versions.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Good movie but really hard to grasp.  Its heart wrenching.  Wasn't too happy with the ending either.  Worth watching at least once.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The Terminator is by far a classic among movies even to this day and age I still enjoy watching this first movie in a set of movies that gave meaning to science fiction action movies.  I don't own the whole set of 4 movies because I didn't care for number three in the set, but I still have this one, T2 Judgement Day, and number 4 Terminator Salvation.  But back to this one this movie set the stage for all over action movies of this style,  plus it gave us one of the memorable movie lines ever because of the Police station scene. \\"I'll be back.\\"  I assume most people have watch the Terminator sets, but if you are one of few people who have yet to see this first one of the set pick this movie up and see what you have been missing all these years.  Between all the car chase scenes, gun fights, things being blown up just makes the action and drama and few other elements even more enjoyable of a movie.  It's well worth the money.
0316069434|5.0|Connelly has it down pat.  Just when you think you have it figured, here comes another sharp curve.  Really well-done and enjoyable.  Harry Bosch is one of a kind.

B00APUQT7I|5.0|Most people seem to have Scrat as their favorite character in this delightful series of movies, but after watching Continental Drift, my daughter and her friends put Granny right up there with Scrat, This movie is entertaining, has good values. I recommend highly!

B00A2BTCM4|5.0|2112 CD + Audio DVD Deluxe Edition.<br /><br />The DVD SOUNDED GREAT !!!!!<br /><br />The Visuals During the Music while playing the DVD_ Especially 2112, added More to the Story of the Songs.<br /><br />2112 has always been one of my Favorite Sections of the Album or CD.<br /><br />I never really played the other songs to much, After listening to them... Now I like them all.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Hilarious throughout whole movie. Definitely worth the laughs you get out of it. Rebel Wilson is the new IT co.edy girls...cant wait to see more comedies with her in them!!
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is so beautiful, so wonderfully written. It is definitely one of my favorites. I absolutely love this book.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|This was very entertaining. So much better than the blue screen over-done special effect factor that has seeped into the film making industry. This was just straight ahead entertainment...a dark comedy/drama wonderfully acted by all. I recommend this. Pop some corn, grab a drink and enjoy!!!
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Movie did get better toward the end, but the early half seemed like a bunch of high school kids playing at making a movie.<br />The concept for Halo is great for making an action Sci fi movie and we should have expected much better for this movie given the Halo game's popularity.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always liked playing these kinds of games. For me it just allows me to forget all of my troubles.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a great movie I found very funny. The music was amazing the story line had some depth and a little love story made this a fun movie to watch.<br />Sexual content- Lots of sexual jokes, references to body parts. Sex talked about often. Lesbian references. A shower scene where they stand and talked naked, a silhouette is shown.<br />Violence- A fight that is more funny then violent, people being mean, making fun of others.<br />Language- No F word, B and Sh were used a handful of times.
B00168OIP8|5.0|Para los fan&aacute;ticos del cine, esta es una pel&iacute;cula que no puede faltar... En alta definici&oacute;n est&aacute; acomodada para que se vea bien, el resultado es bueno pero no se compara a las pel&iacute;culas de ahora.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|While being deployed overseas i had given up video games until my return stateside. Then I saw someone with one of these. It is perfect as I can easily take my entire system anywhere I go, plus I don't have to buy a flat screen t.v. which was the main reason I hadn't been playing any system while overseas. T.V.s of all sizes take up a ton of room and depending on your living conditions, that could mean your desk/workspace is taken over buy a t.v. that you won't spend much time watching anyway (depending on your like for television). This answered a lot of issues I had about bringing my console overseas with me. First it is a briefcase style case which houses the built in monitor, the console and controller, cables and a bit more. This is great because it helps keep down on dust. Second the case has internal padding which helps protect your system while in transport provided your not playing football or hockey with it. And third (probably most important) it's size and ability to fold up to the size of a small carry on means you can easily stow it away which is a must for anyone who lives in a very small room possibly with roommates.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light<br />Compact<br />easy to store<br />Can easily transport<br />Protects System<br /><br />Cons:<br />Smaller screen (size of average laptop) may not be preferable to some gamers<br />must have either XBOX S; XBOX or PS3 Slim<br />no room to hold any games<br /><br />Recommended for:<br />College students<br />Military<br />Serious Gamers<br />Families who travel often<br /><br />I have read a few reviews on other sites and on the manufacturer's forums and I should point out a few things I have discovered. 1) if you have a 1st run PS3 (not a slim) this may not work for you as the first run PS3s are too bulky to be stored in the case and they may or may not meet the software requirements *look at their website for details before buying. They say that as long as the software requirements are met it will work but you won't be able to store the system inside the case. As that is the point of this you may as well buy a real t.v. Also I have read a few comments about the product only working for a week or so. I found out that they had a few issues with some of the earlier \\"batches\\" for lack of a better word as they had received water damage before shipping. However, the company seems to be very helpful in troubleshooting and replacing damaged units and they have a good manufacturer's warranty. Form what I can tell they heve been very helpful in replacing the damaged units and the cases have since dropped. I personally have not had any issues with my unit yet but will update this post if anything changes. (Knock on wood that it doesn't)

B000YMM3CC|5.0|After reading the book, and thoroughly enjoying it (years ago), the movie was finally made.  Typically, the book is always better, however in this case, the movie followed the book closely, and ending up receiving a 'BRAVO' review as far as I'm concerned.<br />I've seen the movie a few times (not something I do often), and bought copies of the movie for gifts.  It's really that good!

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Well for all of us Tarantino fans out there, here is my review in the simplest and most profound way, \\"It's a Quentin Tarantino film, what isn't to like and why haven't you seen it yet?\\"<br /><br />And for the rest of you....<br /><br />As you may or may not already be aware, this movie although a completely original Tarantino film does pay homage to the spaghetti western as well as other genre films and gets its title from an earlier film of a similar name called [[ASIN:B0072V394E Django]] (although the story lines are completely and totally different) which starred Franco Nero who by the way has a small part in this film as a patron in a bar. If you are familiar with Nero, see if you can spot him during his scene. And like Nero, there are a whole slew of recognizable actors throughout the entire film and I challenge you to recognize each one of them before they are realized during the end credits.<br /><br />The basic plot of the movie is as follows:<br /><br />The timeframe is approximately two years before the start of the Civil War and takes place throughout the South and West. The title character Django (the \\"D\\" is silent), played by Jamie Foxx (who we all know from [[ASIN:B00152M7ZI In Living Color]] and [[ASIN:B003498SDA Collateral]], who is a slave who is just recently freed by a bounty hunter/dentist by the name of Dr. King Shultz, played to perfection by Christoph Waltz whom I am sure you remember from a previous Tarantino film, [[ASIN:B002T9H2L0 Inglourious Basterds]].<br /><br />Prior to being freed by Dr. Shultz, Django and his wife Broomhilda, played by Kerry Washington, they both had escaped from a brutal plantation owner and while on the run accidentally becomes separated from each other. Broomhilda ends up being sold to another plantation owner, while Django is eventually freed by Dr. Shultz.<br /><br />After freeing Django, Dr. Shultz offers him the job of being as his partner, which Django accepts, and begins training him in the deadly skills needed to be a successful bounty hunter. However, Django had one, and only one, condition of Dr. Shultz and that was for Dr. Shultz to help Django track down his missing wife who, as they later find out, was sold to a ruthless plantation owner named Calvin Candie. Candie, as I am sure you are well aware, is played to a gleefully diabolical devilishness by none other than Leonardo DiCaprio who, in my humble opinion, turned in one of his most memorable performances to date.<br /><br />Dr. Shultz and Django work together for several months throughout the winter tracking and killing wanted criminals before embarking upon Django's quest to find and free his missing wife. When they do eventually find the plantation she is on, they also find the delightfully ruthless and quite evil plantation owner Calvin Candie, who is every bit the cunning adversary that one might expect of a Tarantino villain. This leads to a very \\"Tarantino-esque\\" showdown that really get the blood flying (pun intended). However, one must not forget the delightful performance of Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's uniquely brilliant \\"man of the house\\" who is absolutely stunningly hilarious in his performance. The entire theater was literally laughing uncontrollably with Jackson's over-the-top performance.<br /><br />Now of course there are going to be those that are going to be a bit put out by the obviously touchy subject matter \\"slavery,\\" which admittedly was and is a terrible thing, but if we continue to live in the past, and people it is in the past, then how can we every expect to move forward. And while we are at it, let's not forget the seemingly over-the-top violence and apparent sloppiness in the film-making, but that is really the point of the entire film and the genres in which it pays homage. Don't go to this film and watch it for anything other than the shear entertainment value in which it was intended. This is not an \\"art house\\" film, this is a Tarantino film and with that, nothing else need be said!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Movie Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.aid!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Movie Lover<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

B0083DJWGO|4.0|I am well acquainted with Mr. Taleb's work and have been reading most of the chapters as he posted them on his site... I firmly believe that everyone should read his work ... In my opinion his advice is spot on if a little harsh in tone... It is a clear antidote for the happy  talk that we get from academe, the chattering press and the anointed political class..<br /><br />The premises  that he ardently promotes are for me charts and channel markers for staying rocks of risk which are sorely needed in this age of happy talk, unwarranted certainly and willful ignorance...<br /><br />Few have his willingness to take that flack for their views that too many little emperors in their fields of study have no clothes many not even a shred of common sense...<br /><br />This book is a long read which is well worth the time ...This book will help prepare you for a better future... but you will have to learn to understand optionality...It is also amusing...

I cannot wait to see where it's going. Stay tuned I know I will.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I, like most folks, love Eastwood. I saw the trailer and thought that I might enjoy the movie. I loved the film. Eastwood is always great, so nothing more needs to be said about that. I haven't seen Amy Adams in a film before, but I certainly will in the future. She was more than excellent as the daughter. I left the movie with a warm feeling and that's all I can ask. I usually judge a movie by whether I would see it again. I definitely will watch this one another time.

1591843065|5.0|I originally bought this book in a bookstore to think about a presentation I was preparing in a different way. After reading the most helpful reviews, I wanted to contribute a different perspective. Most of the reviewers focus on whether there's enough information here to warrant a book. Or that author Dan Roam used his book to congratulate himself too much in finding a profession that really isn't a profession. Both perspectives are probably fair when you wonder whether this book is a good one to buy and \\"get through.\\"<br /><br />Regardless of all that, \\"The Back of the Napkin\\" has been useful for me on several occasions. When you see how people typically put together their PowerPoint presentations and whether they truly accomplish what they set out to do, I'd say generally they do not. They think about the most important subject matter they're covering and pull out the content to put up on the screen to read back TO their audiences. If done in a training class, the trainees mark in their notes that that's important so they can be ready for the test. Many, many PowerPoints for training or presentation are constructed in this way. Which is why PowerPoints often have a bad reputation for making presentations little more than presenters talking AT their audiences rather than WITH them. The result is that they miss the opportunity to truly discuss and analyze topics, to consider different approaches, to make decisions about solving issues, or to buy into whatever that presenter is selling.<br /><br />What Dan proposes in this book is that visualizing those kinds of presentations can get presenters to what they really hope happens with their audiences. Here is the short paragraph Roam offers near the beginning that really encapsulates what this approach accomplishes that makes this book worth reading:<br /><br />\\"...[This] was my watershed moment in understanding the power of pictures. I thought about all the problems [my sketch] helped to solve. First, simply by drawing it, I had clarified in my own mind a previously vague idea. Second, I was able to create the picture instantly, without the need to rely on any technology other than paper and pen. Third, I was able to share the picture with my audience in an open way that invited comments and inspired discussion. Finally, speaking directly from the picture meant I could focus on any topic without having to rely on notes, bullet points, or a written script. The lesson for me was clear. We can use the simplicity and immediacy of pictures to discover and clarify our own ideas, and use those same pictures to clarify our ideas for other people, helping them discover something new for themselves along the way.\\"<br /><br />I probably agree with the other reviewers that the act of originally reading this book is perhaps more than you want to know about the theory or science of why visualization works. But as a reference book, \\"The Back of the Napkin\\" has been helpful for me in several situations where we had to get away from words on a screen to get an audience understanding the complexity of an issue they were meeting to learn, discuss and problem-solve. Once you get through that initial reading, the idea and the numerous pictures Roam uses in the book can be a helpful step in improving a presentation you're about to give. It's a great book to have on your bookshelf for reference.g it, I had clarified in my own mind a previously vague idea.

B009C7ZQM4|3.0|First off, the user interface on this app is wonderful. It seems to clear the cache well too. I also like the feature to check what app installers are on the device from apps that you have uninstalled. As well as the option to delete them. This feature works wonderfully. Sadly, it only clears history from the default Android browser. Kindle uses Silk so this features does no good. I tried it just to see, but it doesn't clear browser history. Also, it will only clear Google Play history. It does not clear Amazon App Store history.

Am, also impressed it provides this protection on several different browsers. I have had no problems with updates like some of the other Kindle Fire reviews state. I only wish that this was more customisable for the Kindle. This comes with a lot of features that are useless on the Kindle due to it not being a phone.

B007ZGBZHE|2.0|The stand alone stories were very good.  This one does not flow and has Corrie and Constance stories which add nothing to the plot and leave you wondering why they were added to the story.  Killing off of Helen so quickly in the story without letting us get to know her felt wrong from that point on nothing seem right with the story line.  Not sure I will ever read another novel by them in the future.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Amazing album. Listening to King Animal made me feel like somebody put me in a time machine and blasted me back to 1991 -- when the world made sense. The 15 year layoff didn't cramp Soundgarden's style. Superlative tracks: Worse Dreams, By Crooked Steps, and Non State Actor will hook you immediately. The only song that doesn't seem to fit is Halfway There. It sounds more like a Chris Cornell solo act. Still a good track though. If you liked Soundgarden in the 1990s, you'll love this album.

B001F12J48|1.0|I ordered this is March but didn't watch it until Christmas and I wish I would have checked it right after I got it. I thought it was the type of 3D that I could watch on my 3D TV but it wasn't. It was the kind of 3D technology that came with the red and blue lens paper glasses of the 50s technology for a move made in 2004. I figured we'd bit the bullit and try to watch it with the glasses they included. When we put the movie in, the movie was so blurry we couldn't even watch it. The red in the glasses was also so dark you could hardly see out of the lens. It was total crap. So we put in the other regular movie included and it was blurry too and the volume was so low we could hardly hear it even with our surround a sound turned all the way up. I'm throwing this DVD in the recycle bin since it's not worth a nickle. We ended up watching Polar Express on Netflix and enjoyed it tremendously. I'm sorry that I didn't check this DVD out earlier. It looks like a cheaply produced copy and shouldn't be on the market at all. I'm VERY disappointed that I got ripped off like this but I guess you get what you pay for even though it was sold as new it surly wasn't one that was factory produced.

1401324649|4.0|REVIEW: THE ONE HUNDRED-YEAR OLD MAN<br /><br />The back cover of this witty and droll novel compares it with Forest Gump but that is a very superficial comparison. Jonassun's novel is much deeper, incisive and more relevant than Gump. The author takes the opportunity to use a centenarian's exploits not merely to place him alongside famous figures or events but to draw incisive caricatures of a wide array of historical figures from Harry Truman to Mao Tse Tung, Joseph Stalin, Charles DeGaulle and Richard Nixon. Each caricature is well-drawn, according to the author's disposition and each contains kernels of accuracy, although there is much left to debate.<br /><br />But debate is not really what this book is all about. This is a whimsical, absurdist adventure that is amenable to quibbling at every turn. But why bother? Why not just have fun and go along for the ride? That's what I did and despite my penchant for historical accuracy, I am a stickler on that count, I managed to put it aside and just have a good time, a snicker here and there, and an occasional laugh. This book is amusing, quick read and best of all, downright first-class entertainment. So toss aside your politics, save your quibbles for a different book and just have fun with an impossibly unbelievable centenarian who manages to get into and out of a myriad situations, each one of which would be the death of any real life character.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a great book that explains many of the &#34;secret&#34; behind stagestage workings of many recent administrations as far back as Truman. Great for history &#34;buffs&#34;!

My only complaint with this is the controls. If you do the finger flick or the control pad it just doesn't work quite right. It's almost as though there is a slight delay. That being said, it's fun and I did enjoy it overall.

B008B11RLQ|4.0|Really suprised and happy with this item, yet there are 1/2 * star \\"issues\\": sometimes too much is too much and here we have \\"bonus\\" songs (for this Reviewer and 48 year fan of the Big El) ruining the \\"nostalgic\\" aspect. Something like using a c. 1970 reissue cover of the first album can really *sting* the old-timers, like me. Continuing...<br /><br />Case in point: On SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY, we open with the song which \\"shoulda\\" opened it, \\"Surrender\\", Presley's international opera entries, but it throws me off-kilter. Using bonus tracks on an album also found on the preceding album is another strange aspect. Alright. Continuing, in the same vein:<br /><br />ELVIS PRESLEY, has additional stuff at the tail end...and tell ya the truth...I'm prepared to give it away to a friend. And *that* was the one (along with ELVIS FOR EVERYONE) that I enthused over the most while waiting for delivery. That 1956 album was supposed to take me back in time to that day in New Jersey in 1965 when I walked through two feet of snow, about three miles for the record.<br /><br />Have not played all the discs, but another \\"forewarning\\": I cannot hear any remixes, just \\"remasters\\" and so Elvis' majestic high note at the end of \\"There's Always Me\\", is still, mysteriously, lost in the crescendo.<br /><br />Another bothersome situation: the album jackets open like in the good old vinyl days but it's not user friendly (or disc-friendly) in 2014...guess why? the disc always finds it way partially out of the jacket! Bad!<br /><br />Ending this review on a \\"positive\\" for this Reviewer at least is the chance to revisit several albums I played 1.5 times way back when...such as LOVE LETTERS ('71)and ELVIS TODAY ('75). They are exceptionally good albums and most importantly, the man is *engaged*. Critics then and now will have us believe these are negligible but especially the latter album, from that supposed \\"jumpsuit era\\", has some of the best singing you'll ever get from Presley. There are certain albums where his voice really soars, such as G.I. BLUES, ELVIS IS BACK, FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS, etc., and this Country Rock effort follows suit. Yes, an essential.<br /><br />Excellent album-by-album mini \\"back story\\" notes, included.albums where his voice really soars, such as G.I.

B0083V2W6I|4.0|Quadrophenia came to theaters in 1979. It arrived at a time in my life when I was done with the trials and traumas of my late teens. I recently bought this dvd on a whim and I'm glad I did. Phil Daniels as Jimmy did a first rate job, as did the rest of the cast. This movie managed to be both funny and memory inducing at the same time. For me, Quadrophenia was definitely worth its price.
B005KIPVK6|4.0|highly overrated at this price but you must pay if you want the popular lego brand.  It's the rage of the youth of today.  For my 5 yr old grandson
B004SEUJ82|1.0|History issues don't bother me too much. Hollywood had not presented itself to the world as a source of factual materials, although sometimes it does. This film was never promoted as factual, just like Inglorious Basterds was not. And I loved that film because it pretty much sums up my fantasy of what SHOULD have happened to the Nazis.<br /><br />I didn't benefit at all from this film. It was needlessly horrifying at the end. I gained nothing from this film. I already have lots of compassion for the suffering of others. I already know enough about the Holocaust. I already have seen enough kids die, working in medicine. I've seen enough pain, angst, suffering... I like to be entertained by films or moved by films... but not horrified and depressed by films. And this film is depressing. If you want to walk away feeling moved or happy, don't watch it. If you want to feel depressed about a film, you'll love it.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Puchased this title solely on the strength of the memories I have of it as a youth and now almost two decades later it's still just as powerful and energetic. A lot of things don't hold up with time and are mostly carried on by nostalgia, I've certainly questioned my taste on certain titles from the past, but this is not one of them. A neglected gem, this deserves to be up there with other great films like Good Will Hunting, The Green Mile or Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />It may be a little &#34;violence&#34; prone (what isn't these days?) for some but the film does have depth and there is something to take away from it. It's certainly one of the best pieces I've seen to speak from the angle of the subjectivity of what precisely &#34;justice&#34; is and the catharsis that comes with revenge. A classic anti-hero story where something feels right about the main character's crusade even though he is clearly in the wrong. I also appreciate the film's subtle and cynical sense of humor. At the very least worth watching; won't be a waste of anyone's time. Love it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Other than being HIGHLY derivative from WoW, this game has so many problems and frustrations that it's hardly worth playing... especially on the kindle. The last time they rolled out an update, it updated on time, but all of my characters disappeared and i didnt get them back for nearly two weeks. This update has been just as bad -- the game is currently inaccessible and has been that way for neafly a week now. We simply dont have access to the update that all other android users have happily been playing for a week now. And the customer service response from GL has been virtually non-existent aside from the occasional non-native english-speaking employee popping into the forums to say something completely irrelevant to the situation. If i have to wait much longer, im pretty sure i will have completely stopped caring about this game. If you're considering purchasing this game, don't bother. it's occasionally fun, but the company is just completely incompetent. more trouble than its worth

My daughter was being kind of pain so I tossed the small package at her and told her to be quiet!! Boy was she, upon opening the package!! She was SO stoked that I got her it!!

B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is my kind of book....a real saga of 20th century history. Interesting characters during world changing times. I look forward to the next two books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|loved the story!!! but, now that I've read it, it's done.. as opposed to a regular book which you can give to others. so, i wish i could transfer this to someone else who has a kindle.  Is there a way?????
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I have been working on building my mp3 music library. This was a terrific find, because this is one of my all time favorite bands. I will be rocking this.
B009A87X80|5.0|One of the most moving voices I have every had the opportunity to listen to. The world lost something beautiful when we lost her.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I've also read all the Preston and Child novels.  This was the least enjoyable book I've ever read.<br />They must have run out of ideas to write about, to stoop to the easy way out, and write about Nazis.<br />Great idea guys; maybe some American scientists will try it; lots of rich billionaires would pay for<br />a reserve human for blood and organs!  LOL!!!  Needless to say, I will not be reading P & C anymore.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie was blah. I did not laugh as much as I assumed I would...more of a few chuckles. Glad I did not pay to see this at the movies. Watch if you are extremely bored and nothing else is on TV.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not good like others on explaining the depth of a book, character development and such. All I can say is that I am so happy that Colleen shares her wonderful talent with us. She truly is my favorite Author. This latest book is nothing short of amazing! I LOVE Holden and Sky! I didn't want it to end! I kept stopping and telling my Husband what was going on, until he ended up asking ME what was happening now  lol I know that people have different tastes, but it is so hard for me to even imagine that others wont like her books. I tried to read it slowly so it would last, but I just couldn't!!!  xoxo
B0084BMUFA|5.0|In these times, when is very easy publicate books, A Christmas Carol of Dickens show than the classics became classics because are high level books.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie will make you laugh and cry at all the right moments.  It's one of the best movies I've ever seen!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Great special effects, 3 D was okay, stupid decisions by crew, okay story, lotsa holes, answers no questions. Looking for sequel.
0143120530|5.0|Joshua Foer has done an exceptional job with writing this book. From start to finish, he takes you on a journey. He outlines the idea of how important memory is in society and how with the introduction of technology we have slowly stopped using our brains and instead look to other forms of memory (writing, computers, etc.). This does not teach you how to become a world memory champion although he does outline the methods that are used.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the mind and memory as a whole. He shows how everyone has the same memory (except for an few) and through little work one can learn methods to have an exceptional memory.<br /><br />Great book, plan on re-reading in the near future.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|La compré porque vi el Trailer y me pareció llamativa. La imagen en Bluray es buena. La historia carece de la fuerza dramática que lo mantenga a uno pegado a ella. Gran banda sonora.
B009B2VBWE|3.0|We really enjoy Diana Krall.  Her voice and piano are, well, gifts.<br /><br />That said, we prefer several of her other albums.  If you are starting your Krall collection, choose another for your first purchase.  If you like (love) her as much as we do, add this as your third or fourth album.<br /><br />It's all good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is by far one of my favorites it may even be better then Harry Potter the book and the movie
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This movie is so great. I had already seen it once but I just rented it so that I could watch it again because I like it so much. The acting is awesome and I feel that this movie outlines (on some levels) the average American family.<br /><br />Would recommend this to any of my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best. Book. Ever. I have read it multiple times, yet it never gets old or boring. If you like action stories, this is the book for you.<br />:)
1450419895|5.0|I have strength training anatomy as well, before this book and loved it. This one is much thicker and more detailed with the workouts needed for your routine or muscle group you want to sculpt. I haven't read it all, but i'm excited to pick it up and get the information needed for a particular workout. Pick it up, you'll love it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|A christmas classic in all it's blu-ray splendor. This is a nice compliment to any movie collection, one that is sure to be enjoyed every year at christmas time. Enables the viewer to make out fine details such as brands, prices, and other small detail that is often missed in lower quality versions. Gives older viewers something to reminisce about. Well worth it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|perfect for me. I  love mahjong and my kindle these two work great together . I recommend this game with five stars for the casual player.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Its very catchey from the start and kept me interested did not want to put the book down<br />waking up married<br />was funny
B008D563IC|4.0|MUCH better than American Pie 3, which just about killed the series, in my opinion. This is a much better, much more thought out movie than AP3. Not as good as the first two, but solid, nonetheless.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good reads! This was a good finish to the trilogy. Katniss showed the ups and downs of war and heroism
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This movie is not for everyone, but for the individuals who do not mind or enjoy dark subject matter, you can't do better than this movie. The aesthetic is beautiful and there is not one shot in the movie where the sun is shining, which is fitting due to the mature themes brought up in this movie. The acting is fantastic and the great editing moves the story along perfectly. I was never bored or confused about what was happening on screen. Also, the soundtrack should be placed upon the pedestal of all-time great soundtracks, as it fits the movie perfectly and adds so much depth to the story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|easy to level up.  fun and addictive. i loved oregon trail when i played in school. i reccomend anyone to play formindless fun.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Emma Stone is an absolute delight.  This is the first film I have seen her in.  Since seeing her here, I've watched her in  &#34;The Help&#34;  and &#34;Crazy, Stupid Love&#34;,  and she is wonderful in them all.<br /><br />All the main characters in Easy A are entertaining, and  (probably because of Emma Stone as well as the supporting cast)  I have watched this film several times.  While younger folk would certainly enjoy it,  those of us a bit older would as well,  as it is a fun, entertaining story with delightful characters.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|Enjoyed watching TinTin.  I was not sure ordering a DVD online would be beneficial, but it certainly was and I would do it again.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's deadpan dark humor is fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Cohen Brothers or to anyone who is looking for a classic comedy.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition. I really enjoyed the movie. I thought Gary cooper was a bit stiff in his part, but otherwise did a great job. Patricia O'Neal's performance was a bit too much. I think this might be in keeping with the acting and directing styles of the era. But, it was great entertainment with a good, strong story line. I am more than happy with this purchase.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Written by a physician,  the book contains much detailed medical information about the brain and cognitive functioning that,  while fascinating,  can also become a bit distracting for the layman from the main point of the book  --  Dr. Alexander's near death experience.  It is quite thought provoking,  and perhaps a challenge for those who have set views on the subject to remain open-minded enough to consider an alternate perception of reality.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander does a good job in communicating his story,  and I found it especially interesting to read about his transition afterwards to &#34;normal&#34; functioning,  as if anyone can remain the same after such an experience.  A fascinating read.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I am trading in Lady Lara Croft in for Master Cheif, don't get me wrong I still love Tomb Raider but I have been a fan of it since I played the second game. Anyway I saw this on youtube as the webseries and I fell in love with it. I love everything about it. The story telling was amazing, and this is an example of what i can do with my own webseries. I was excited to see the actress that plays susan from the narnia films, the first two anyway in this. It's a great way for new comers that are interested in Halo to check out. I hope they come out with more Halo movie and more webseries, this is awesome. People need to use this as a place to start when making future Halo movies. I got this for christmas by the way.
B002QP145C|4.0|This is a good addition to any WW2 collection, since you see what other countries went through, not just Germany and the United States, very good effects and use of equipment. Sub-titles as usual but that's not a problem. A good historically correct film.
B005I0DLXK|5.0|My interest in Rihanna is the product of the movie &#34;Battleship&#34;. I had never heard her sing or perform befor then. So, I decided to learn more about her via her music samples at Amazon. I was duly impressed. She isn't just another pretty face, but a talented singer. I especially enjoyed the song on &#34;Loud&#34;. S&M is my favourite. I don't think many singers are gutsy enough to do sing it, or capable of doing it so well.
1559210400|4.0|I have enjoyed many of Pearl Buck's books. This is another one worth reading if interested in old Chinese culture.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have owned several versions of this game since it originally came to the Wii. It is one of the most original and addicting physics puzzler i have every played.
0857860801|5.0|I have loved the Simon's cat video's from the beginning and this book is the best so far.  The artwork is brilliant!
B0068TL23G|5.0|Love it, very addictive.  For anyone who likes to compete on themselves this game will have you keep trying to beat your old score.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend gave us this book to read. My husband is retired and read it in a day.He insisted I read it, so I downloaded it. Great book
B003L77FYS|4.0|It came on time without any damage but I haven't watched it since it was a Christmas gift for somebody else.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My wife somehow caught her kindle cord on the edge of the bed, ripping out the wires.  Bare wires are not replaceable -- would the item even be repairable?  On calling Kindle Help, and after a detailed description of the damage, the \\"Kindle Girl\\" concluded all we needed was a new cable giving me the part no.  In what I'm sure was less than a week the new cord arrived and her Kindle back in use.  Thanks.
141659521X|4.0|It made me realize that I never want to go to Yemen! This country is not on my list of the 50 countries I must visit before I die. God bless the United States of America!
B007SGM084|5.0|My daughter in law kept telling me about these books she was reading on her kindle I bought her. She reads books but not the kind I like. Anyway I was at lunch with an old friend one day and she ask me if I had read them I said no. After lunch I went home and downloaded them. OMG is the best thing I can say. I'm 59 but a young 59 I like to think and I couldn't put them down
B008H6GH8I|5.0|The CGI Resident Evil movies can be terrible and yet amazing. I was entertained, learned more of the RE world and enjoyed watching Leon Kennedy run around while Ada Wong tried to screw everyone over again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. It is very,very good and addicting . I can never put it down. I love playing it all day.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game.  only wish coins accumulated faster!  Great way to pass the time for people of all ages!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I rented this one my Kindle Fire, he watched it several times in the 48 hrs, so I bought it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's an extremely  addictive book the details and events leave you wanting more. It is an incredibly well written action and romance book
B00A12VJZM|5.0|This is a must for ANY Stones fan.  Includes tracks I wouldnt have thought to include if I had piecemealed one at a time.  Now just need one for the newest stuff!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It found it interesting from the first page to the last.  I like court room issues, but I really liked the parenting angle (what would you do if your son was accused of murder; could you ever consider he could have done it) and I never ever expected it to end the way it did!  Liked it very much and looking for more books like it.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Downloaded for my daughter and now everyone in the family has on their kindle or iPhone. Fun times. Keeps bugging me to come back through.
B001OMJGD0|1.0|Shockingly bad. Too much emotion and drama. Wanted to see a super hero movie not a soap opera. Wow! That was disappointing.
B00466HM28|4.0|Gave it as a gift to a musician friend and they're loving it.  Would recommend. Good size and quality and its an Akai.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Although the story varies a little too much from the original, it keeps the kids engaged enough to get the underlying message.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a pretty fun Super Mario clone. A bit simplistic of course, to deal with only having touch controls, and keep the screen from being cluttered. Excellent way to kill some time.
B001LF347E|4.0|I'm a bit of a history buff, and it is part of the entertainment watching \\"Merlin\\" for me to note all the assorted ways its producers managed to screw up history. I mean, not that we know a whole lot about 6th century Britain, but we know enough to understand that Arthurian Camelot (if and when it ever existed) looked nowhere closer to its depiction in the series. Which is probably best described as one part late middle ages, one part renaissance fair. It probably tells us more about 21st century UK than about 6th century. (Seriously, casting an Indian actress as Guinevere? Not that there's anything wrong with it.)<br /><br />Other than that, it's a mildly entertaining PG-rated show, nothing too gruesome or complicated. Pillars of the Earth it is not. I guess it was targeted primarily at the adolescent & teen audience. Adults can watch too if you're tired and you just want to relax.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie got so much hype and great reviews, even from friends, that I was surprised to find myself not enjoying it as much as I thought I would. I still think it is a good movie. And I like this Bruce Banner best of the 3 (in the movies).<br /><br />If you like the other Marvel super movies, you'll enjoy this.
0316212377|5.0|The Culture will never lack for stories as long as Minds and ships mingle and meddle with sentient beings. I devour every new book and can hardly wait for the next one to appear.
0071762345|3.0|gives good overviews but this is geared more towards social media novices - which it'd be great for - but those looking for more &#34;in-depth&#34; tips, tricks, helpful/ useful info. might look elsewhere. overall though, it's a good place to &#34;start&#34; if you're new to social media.
B0011Z32KI|5.0|This album got me hooked on Michael Buble in 2005 when the song Home came out. Before that the only jazz vocalist I LOVED listening to was Diana Krall. When I heard &#34;Home&#34; I bought and started listening to this album ALL THE TIME.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|This holiday classic looks great on the Fire HD (8.9\\"). The text pop-up feature works well to enhance readability of the text.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The fowl language ( the &#34;F&#34; bomb) in this movie was totally over used. It took away any enjoyment if this move I could have had.  An occasional word or two is tolerable but the was pretty much over the top.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|the Android version is just as addictive as the computer version. it's nice to see that the programmers at 2D Boy kept the continuity going when they made the transition.
B001NB5BA4|5.0|I have my albums that I LOVE to listen to just about any time or day. This is one of them and has been for years. I'm a big U2 fan but I'm also a HUGE Michael Buble fan and a HUGE Drake fan and a HUGE Damien Rice fan...this album is distinct in it's historical roots and timeless rock sound.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wanted this for a long time though in this economy it was a bit pricey so I waited and it is better in a boxed set easy to keep track of all of them
1603427244|5.0|For a fairly new knitter, I am very pleased with this book!  I doubt I'll ever need another book of its kind.  Now, for more projects!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was very difficult to put this book down. As always an amazing story by Grisham, one of his best. The story sucked me in.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another classic John Corey tale.  Bonus character Paul Brunner from The General's Daughter and Upcountry. You won't be able to put it down.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|It is ok but to get much more creative requires buying more DLC and they are not cheap.  Still, some fun watching the world end. The original board game Pandemic is much more fun.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Prepare yourself to be immediately taken on a vicarious journey along with Pi!  It's so physical; my arm or leg would flex and jerk at times.  Metaphysical and so very profound; my sense of reason cried out for Pi's reasoning.  Feeling like I too was set adrift in the wretched, hopeless  ocean; salty tears ran down my face,  or was it the rain?  Felt like I was sitting on the tiny, battered 3\\" edge of the LifeBoat as a participant trying not to be noticed; both in fear and awe of beautiful Richard Parker,  the Bengal Tiger... or in fear and awe of Pi?  Amazing what the mind can do to protect itself from severe emotional trauma.  Everyone should jump into this lifeboat with Pi and Richard Parker... adreniline tastes' much better than popcorn.  What a stunning movie!  Wow!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Generally like wall berg in movies and Seth McFarland.  This was beyond awful and couldn't get past the first 20 minutes.
B00110K62U|2.0|WARNING!!! UNSKIPPABLE TRAILERS AT BEGINNING OF DISK<br /><br />You have been warned.<br /><br />I paid good money for this product. I own the disk. Why should I have to watch the same ads every time my family wants to watch the disk?  The actual content was quite good after the trailers. Buy something else if you value your time.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|title says it all, it says it will work on gen 1 but it didnt work for me. Return was fast and easy though.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read and insight to the accomplishments of a true soldier. Very exciting and moving all at once. Thank you for your service!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is the best dragon game ever. you guys should buy this thing. you can like breed dragons and. ame Thames bigger and you have lots and lots of dragons you can get. And there are many levels that you can reach. this game is supercalafragilisticexpealodocious. BUY IT!!!!!!
1432794426|5.0|There are simply not enough words to express how much I love and appreciate Karen Moriarty's beautiful book , \\"Defending a King.\\" I have been a Michael Jackson admirer for almost ten years now, and it breaks my heart how badly he was treated, misunderstood, and lied about when all he wanted to do was help heal the world, especially our children. He had a heart of a child, and I have never read a more beautiful,  truthful,  heartfelt,  and genuine book that explains Michael Jackson the way this book does.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book were how gentle and kind he was as a father and person.  It brought tears to my eyes how he changed and healed so many children's lives with his amazing, caring, and charitable spirit.<br /><br />This book not only shines a ray of light on Michael being the beautiful person he was, but also clears up any misunderstanding and false accusations he was so wrongfully accused of. It touches thoroughly on every part of his life with true facts and credible references. No doubt readers will see Michael Jackson in a  different more positive light than they may have before.<br /><br />I am so thankful to Karen for a book that was so greatly written and from the heart.  If I ever need a book written about myself, Karen Moriarty is the one to do it! :) I definitely want to share this Michael Jackson one with everyone I can!<br /><br />Much L.O.VE.<br />-Hayley L. Howell ♥♥♥
B005LAIGIM|5.0|EDDIE  MURPHY IS OF THE HOOK THIS TIME IT KEPT ME LAUGHING BOY I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE NEED TOTRY THIS I AM SURE YOU WILLLOVE IT AS MUCHAS I DID<br />YES I WOULD RCOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS
B004WR125O|5.0|My Onkyo NR 616 required this device to be able to use my router.  It worked as advertised.  I would buy this product , if needed, again.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does just what it is supposed to do and works nicely since my husband is working odd shifts and resetting our bedside alarm clock continually is cumbersome.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|Incredible acting, fantastic storyline and action to keep you on your toes. I love this movie an highly recommend it!
B0033G9OF0|4.0|The previous owners name was written in very large letters on the back of the sleeve. The fact that the name was written was mentioned just not to such a degree.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love rod Stewart and Christmas great cd. If you are rod Stewart fan  you will love it. Great price
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this game is very fun it will give you a whole bunch of seasons t o choose from. my favorite one is the Christmas one. I find it very fun and interesting. I'm not going to lie to you it will get challenging but overall it is very fun.
