B00008OWZC|5.0|'How the West Was Won' is nothing short of a godsend. The greatest hard rock band ever, recorded at the very apex of their incredible but short career, what more do you want? 'BBC Sessions' whetted the appetite for vintage Zep but 'West' delivered the goods for sure. So it's been about 31 years, better late than never! If you are a true Led Zeppelin fanatic and are not blown away by the live versions of the admittingly tired classics then what the hell is wrong with you! I couldn't believe how powerful this performance was and now it is mine to play over and over again. \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Black Dog\\" immediately deliver aural destruction and sensation in their majesty and power. \\"Stairway\\" and \\"Since I've Been Lovin' You\\" are in peak form! \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" combined clock in close to an hour and leave their respective originals in the dust with their innovative, loose jam structure and musical dexterity. The covers medley in the latter is a blast with standbys John Lee Hooker, Ricky Nelson and Elvis making an appearance. If you think because you have 'Song Remains the Same' and you don't need this masterpiece, you are screwing yourself! 'West' blows the former any in so many different ways. \\"Rock n'Roll\\" and the  three previews from 'Houses of the Holy\\" add some extra spice along with Bonzo's calling card, \\"Moby Dick\\" (outrageously 19 minutes long!) Set closer \\"Bring it On Home\\" is a nice treat and an extended goodbye from a \\"I wish I owned a time machine\\" type show. Zeppelin's reputation as a top live act was always secure even when regarding the soundtrack album, but 'West' leaves absolutely no doubt. Could be my favorite live album of all time, or at least top five. Greatest Zep album! Just might be! This the real deal!
0307276902|1.0|when i first read this book i was intrigued by the things that the author had to say, proud almost of the fight that he put up to overcome his alcoholism....about two weeks ago i read the smoking gun's report on all of the discrepancies, all of the lies, all of the things that weren't 'quite right.' i still didnt believe it. but after today's viewing of oprah, i have to say that i completely change my views on the way that this author has portrayed everything in the book. i am ashamed to say that i even read it. i am going to get rid of it, i do not want something in my possession that is based on a million little lies.

B000069HK2|4.0|Solid from start to finish with mind-blowing mixing, heavy drums with a sceaching guitar, complemented with heavy bass. Bert's vocals are top notch, and every song is full of captivating melodies and harsh screaming. Everybody will look back at this album the way people look back at At the Drive-in. Every sceamo band from this moment on is automaticly influenced by them.
0375420525|5.0|During a business trip, an associate suggested that I read this book. Told him that I'd never heard of the author or the title. He leant me his busted up paperback copy. I asked him if he'd got this used? Nope, he said, I'm the only one who's read it. <br /> <br />Needless to say, when I got home, I was curious. I began reading at 6pm, and by 4am I was finished. Now, when a book is very good, I'm able to speed read through it. This book made me go into overdrive --- endless coffee throughout the night. And, to make matters worse, when I got home the next night after work (riding on about 3hrs sleep), I went back to the book, and read it again. <br /> <br />I've now read this classic six times. And, yes, the word classic is not a hyberbole. This is thee hands down, best horror novel to come out in the last 15 years. (or atleast since McCammon's \\"Boy's Life\\" has come out). <br /> <br />This novel is frightening on so many levels, it's impossible to describe. It's a book, within a book, within a book. <br /> <br />I just hope that Danielewski hasn't written his Magnum Opus so young in his writing career. But, trust me, many an author out there would want this as their notch in literary excellence. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|What a girl! Yeah I love this Lebanese dyme piece!
B0007GAEGC|2.0|Put me in the \\"unimpressed\\" camp of listeners to this album.  As a fan of REAL Celtic music (Chieftains, Altan, et al.) I too find this an amazingly bland performance.  The vocals are uneven - Lisa Kelly's voice, for instance, is pleasant and warm enough, but Chloe Agnew, who seems to be touted on this CD as a headliner,  is no Charlotte Church - her teenage voice is thin and tentative.  The orchestral arrangements are at times sappy and overblown, sounding like \\"Riverdance Lite\\".  Some of the instrumental work is competent, like Orla Fallon's harp and Mairead Nesbitt's fiddle, but it's not like I haven't heard better elsewhere.  My overall impression is this was an assemblage of pretty faces whose primary purpose seems to be to create another popular PBS pledge-drive special.  Pardon me if I offended anyone - if this happens to be your cup of Irish tea, please indulge.  As for me, I'm going to put on an Altan CD.
B000A3XYZA|4.0|More than many opera seria, Handel's 1725 Italian opera, \\"Rodelinda\\", provides such a palpable story of jealousy, revenge and undying devotion that it is no wonder the opera itself has been given such widely diverse translations over the years. I was fortunate to experience two wonderful productions of \\"Rodelinda\\" just this past year. The first was Stephen Wadsworth's elaborate Metropolitan Opera production set on a beautiful 18th-century country estate, starring superstar soprano Ren&eacute;e Fleming in the title role and the extraordinary countertenor David Daniels as her husband Bertarido. The second also starred Daniels but with rising soprano Catherine Naglestad in David Alden's expressionistic film noir adaptation at the San Francisco Opera (first staged by Munich's Bavarian State Opera).<br /><br />The 1998 Glyndebourne Festival production, directed by Jean-Marie Villegier and captured on this DVD, takes yet another creative path by setting the story in the black-and-white world of 1920's silent cinema. Completely different in execution and style, all three versions simply prove how the highly charged drama and soaring music translate easily in almost any period setting. Although Alden's production is more audacious and heavily symbolic, Villegier brings a relatively simplified approach to the storyline and encourages a highly stylized, silent screen type of acting from his cast. For the most part, it works, and the minimalist sets by Nicolas de Lajartre and Pascale Cazales provide an effective counterpoint. Costume designer Patrice Cauchetier, however, sometimes gets carried away with the fussy, anachronistic clothing she provides, which does little to enhance the performances.<br /><br />Fortunately, the stellar cast is strong enough to transcend such stylizations and shortcomings. In the demanding title role that requires a strong enough voice to carry eight significant arias, veteran soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci is a fiery presence who conveys defiance with ease and feels at home with elaborately expressive vocal lines. Truth be told, her vibrato can be off-putting at times, and her regal demeanor works against the emotion of the more vulnerable passages, for example, during her extravagant rendition of the heartbreaking Act III aria, \\"Se 'l mio duol non e si forte,\\" in which Rodelinda thinks her husband Bertarido is dead. However, Antonacci's passion and professionalism carry the day.<br /><br />As Daniels has proven recently, Bertarido is one of the truly great roles for an accomplished countertenor. Luckily, Andreas Scholl has a beautiful, emotive voice and fluently handles the wide range of singing from the melancholy of \\"Dove sei, amato bene?\\" to the anger of \\"Vivi, tiranno!\\" with equal ease. Scholl is at his peak during his poignant Act II arias, \\"Con rauco mormorio\\" and \\"Scacciata dal suo nido\\", where his coloratura is particularly impressive. As an actor, however, he is not as charismatic a presence as Daniels (at least back in 1998 when Scholl was starting to emerge on the scene) and consequently tends toward a certain banality for a king who has been not only deposed but left for dead. All is forgiven, however, with the much anticipated duet between Antonacci and Scholl which ends Act II, the magnificent \\"le t'abbraccio\\", which does not disappoint.<br /><br />The rest of the cast handles their roles with uncommon skill - tenor Kurt Streit as the impatient usurper Grimoaldo, baritone Umberto Chiummo as the dastardly henchman Garibaldo, countertenor Artur Stefanowicz as Bertarido's faithful sidekick Unulfo, and mezzo-soprano Louise Winter as Bertarido's sister Eduige. All sing magnificently in this production, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment complements the voices perfectly under the seasoned baton of William Christie. The one major drawback is the way the opera is filmed in overly dark shadows, especially at the beginning, and the alternating long and medium shots that seem unnecessarily busy at times. The visual edginess and restlessness tend to distract from the onstage drama when the focus should be on the beauty of the music. Regardless, this is a faithful record of a Handel masterwork wonderfully performed. The superb Baroque music speaks for itself.stlessness tend to distract from the onstage drama when the focus should be on the beauty of the music.

B00000K31Q|4.0|But there is absolutely nothing I hate about the 10 Things I Hate About You. Personally, one of my favorite teen comedies in my DVD collection. If you read the other reviews you'll know the plot, based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. It's a great movie with a lot of funny lines (one of my favorite lines in the movie is said by Heath Ledger but I'm afraid it might be inappropriate to quote here). I also like the message that being yourself is what makes you cool in your own right. If you ever had strict parents, you can relate to the Stratford daughters. Very well done and entertaining. 10 Things will be one of those movies you'll watch 10 times over. Check it out!
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"BrokeBack Mountain\\" is a great love story,not dirty.I don't understand what the big deal is.There are movie theathers near my area that won't even show this film.I had to drive to Pittsburgh Pa.  I haven't seen a good movie like this one in  years.You have to see it.
B0000797IO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. After seeing Brokeback Mountain a few times in theaters, and basically admiring not only his terrific acting in that film (which I secretly want to come out on dvd a.s.a.p.; although, still in theaters), I felt it was time to rent some movies w/him in it. I chose Donnie Darko, and The Good Girl. Serious, and Funny at the same time. I believe women (men as well) can really relate to this movie if they are in a place they didn't think they ought to be at this point in they're lives. Jennifer Aniston says it best in the movie when she says: \\"Are you going to your deathbed with unlived life in your veins?\\" So, she acts on it w/ consequences in tow of course. Aniston's first love scene is in this movie which she recalls in the commentary. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal's character, and his flaws. He starts off relatively sane; however, disapointed with the world around him, and this is what ultimately brings his, and Jennifer's character together. You feel for Jake's character, because as a person misunderstood myself...you feel overjoyed when someone comes into your life; that finally can really vibe with you, long after you've given up hope. Under the circumstances (Aniston's character is married) there is absolutely no way this can go smoothly. When the bumps in the road start to occur, things get uncomfortable, and Jake is not as stable as she once thought. Jake Gyllenhaal's character \\"Holden\\" comes across as immature, with unclear thinking in the long run. Jake Gyllenhaal played this character very well. Even after seeing this movie, and possibly putting yourself in that predicament...I personally would of gone through it just to be w/ that character. Then again Jake has a different kind of look...considering the beauty mark above his lips, and what I call the whole \\"eye experience\\" (the eye color itself, the eyelids, thick lashes, and eyebrows) make him a curious cute and handsome + the cute little lips (can't forget those). Aniston's character is impulsive, and at first a bit selfish, and ending; I look at it as self preservation. This is packed w/ some hillarious moments as well. The full frontal male nude scene is quite funny.acter is impulsive, and at first a bit selfish, and ending; I look at it as self preservation. This is packed w/ some hillarious moments as well.

B000BJS4SU|3.0|Hey, this is nice to see; John Mayer really exlporing some blues roots. I'm a big blues fan, and Stevie Ray is one of my biggest influences when I play guitar.  However, they should have called this a SRV tribute album!  Now, the track, Out of your Mind is a nice non-Stevie blues song that shows how mature some of his blues voicings can be.  I agree with some other people on here, his voice doesn't quite fit, but I'm guessing that will improve.  Also, he definately copies Stevie's vocals on here, which I don't think is necessary.  I guess there is something infectious about playing the blues with that great Strat sound that makes you want to play SRV, Hendrix style, God knows I do at times.  But take it down a notch John, it's very transparent.  It's a step in the right direction however, and I applaude the move.  Let's see what they do next on the next album, because I don't think they could get away with this same style again.  Good luck Trio!!!
B000AARKOO|1.0|<br />Ridley Scott in his 'Kingdom of Heaven' obviously wanted to cash in on Orlando Bloom from Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.  <br /> <br />Too bad.  <br /> <br />Bloom's acting was fine just simply mis-cast. And the character \\"Belian\\" that he plays - a blacksmith turned warrior/military leader in what seems like 2 seconds flat is just ridiculous.  <br /> <br />Now the message of the film was very good - about respecting another faith/religion - that we're all part of humanity. Yes, i agree. But Ridley Scott's directing here was 'too much', that is, over-indulgant (especially with respect to the fighting scenes) and too characterized by feigned or affected grandeur.  <br /> <br />Simply put 'Kingdom of Heaven' felt contrived - and 'epic-ish'.  <br />
0440241588|3.0|This book starts off well with an interesting idea - Joel Backman, white collar criminal, is sentenced to a long prison term for various offences.  He is pardoned and relocated to Italy because the CIA has a vested interest in seeing which country will take him out first as retribution for Backman's shady business deals with them.    <br /> <br />Once this beginning is established, Grisham takes us on a leisurely stroll through Italy for the bulk of the book.  There is a lot of filler material in this middle section which bears no relevance to the story, but adds to the ambience of the story.  It's a little like taking a walking tour of Bologna with a well versed tourguide (nice to know Mr Grisham enjoyed his holiday there!). <br /> <br />Then about three quarters of the way through, we come to the 'action'.  However, whilst the reader is, by this time, expecting some very dramatic action to occur because of the build up, it is very anticlimatic.  Grisham had the opportunity to change the pace of his writing to create excitement, but didn't do so.  Therefore, the chase/action scenes are written in the same relaxed style as the rest of the story, which detracts slightly.  I would have also liked to have seen some closer calls and a much more frenetic chase (it is difficult to write about this section without spoiling the ending, so I am deliberately being a little vague). <br /> <br />Finally, the ending is all too easy.  There is no twist, no final close call, just a sort of lacklustre fizzling off to the last page which was very disappointing. <br /> <br />This book could have been a lot more than it was and I feel as though a reasonably good premise for a story was a little wasted with this book.  A lot more effort could have been put into the final quarter of the story to make it much more thrilling.  Joel Backman is a character you will care about and like and this feeling could have been exploited by the author by placing his character in greater jeopardy to draw the reader in further. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked the book but it wasn't keeping me up nights wondering what would happen next.  If you liked the movie The Fugitive with Harrison Ford, you will probably enjoy this book.
B0000584V3|5.0|OPETH - Blackwater Park  -  Blackwater Park is considered by most to be the magnum opus of OPETH.  I am not going to dispute this albums claim to throne, despite my loyalty to the Still Life album.  I do not see any reason to spend time justifying Opeth's best album.  In fact I feel Still Life, Blackwater Park and Ghost Reveries are all equally deserving of the title for different reasons.     [Anyway on to the Review:]  BWP is their first album with the midis touch of Steve Wilson, (Porcupine Tree) this mans genius cannot be disputed.  He took his musical background of Prog-Rock and only further helped Opeth, with their progressive elements.  Lending his vocal and keyboard skills to further compliment the bands sound.  [As of 2005 their touring Keyboard / backing vocalist, Per has officially joined the band.]  The Album opens with the amazing Leper Affinity... which to this day is one of the best openers they have ever done.  This song tosses more riffs into Ten minutes than most bands can achieve in an album, or even in their career for that matter.  I'm not going to bother trying to explain each song because every track on this album is beautiful.  Also, for me, BWP is the album when I truly started to appreciate Martin Lopez's drum skills. (The drumming at 3:20 in Leper Affinity is one of the coolest beats I've ever heard. - Mr. Lopez has only gotten better since this album too... Check out Ghost Reveries!)  I will go into no further details since there are ample reviews telling you to buy this album.    Favorite Tracks:  The Leper Affinity, Bleak, Harvest, and Blackwater Park.  -5 Stars.    [Seriously what are you waiting for?  Buy this, Now!]    IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:  \\"Was this review helpful?\\"
B0007O38F8|1.0|I can't believe rap is so mainstream.  It is the fakest music out there, and 50 Cent is among the worst artists ever, ranking with singers like Davey Jones and the jerk who writes the music for Barney the Dinosaur.   I reccomend you don't buy this album and save your ears for real music like the Beatles, NOFX,  Green Day (before 2005), Tenacious D, and anything else that doesn't suck like 50 Cent does.
B00006SFBD|5.0|OPETH - Deliverance<br /><br /> -<br /><br />As Destructive as it is Beautiful:  Opeth, once again, released another 5 Star album.  Deliverance is a primarily heavy album yet there are lots of ambient slower passages through much of the heavy songs. (Namely Deliverance and Master's Apprentice) Oddly enough, the Deliverance Album has my favorite slower Opeth song ever, \\"A Fair Judgment\\" Which is easily one of the most beautiful songs ever. (The part that comes in a 4:00 with the classical guitars and then Mikeal's vocals at 4:35 - Is easily one of the best music passages I have ever heard.)<br /><br />This album flows really well, however I would not recommend an inspiring Opeth fan start with this album.  The opener, Wreath is a difficult listen for a new fan, it is lengthy, punishing, and unusually heavy. (Even by Opeth Standards)  If you can however sit through that, the album unfolds into yet another Masterpiece under their belt.  The jaw-dropping, Deliverance follows, (listen to the drumming at the end...) then the radiant, A Fair Judgment which leads into the brief, heartfelt, instrumental passage entitled, For Absent Friends.  After that is the furious Master's Apprentice which is one of the heaviest and amazing Opeth songs to date.  And to close the disk is the 14 minute marathon called, By the Pain I See in Others. (Which to this day is possible the most experimental songs by the band.)  All in all, DELIVERANCE is yet another classic by Opeth... But you people should already know this so I will stop with my rant.  If you don't have any Opeth Albums Buy Them! You will not be sorry.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: Master's Apprentice, A Fair Judgment and By the Pain I See in Others.<br /><br />-5 Stars
B00004T9UF|5.0|Ok, everyone knows eminem, but you've never heard him like this before! This whole album is just incredible from the opening skit to the last song! So below heres my review <br /> <br /> <br />Public Service Announcement 2000 - Very good way to start the album off with some seriously twisted humor, it is also very funny. 5/5 <br /> <br />Kill You - I didn't care for this song the first time I heard it but it really grows on you even though the whole song is about violence and drugs. 5/5 <br /> <br />Stan - This is a great song, but it doesn't really fit the rest of the album. 4/5 <br /> <br />Paul - This is great because if you hear the \\"Paul skit\\" on the first album, its telling em to calm down and to stop rapping so harshly and offensivly, but now Paul is just giving up. 5/5 <br /> <br />Who Knew - VERY offensive song and it truly gets you hooked in and ready for the rest of the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />Steve Berman - This is my favorite skit on the album, very funny and it insults eminem but not in a bad way. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Way I Am - This song is great, it follows the previous skit very well and has some lyrics that will make you think about em's life. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />The Real Slim Shady - This song was over-played back in the day yet it never gets old because the lyrics are really funny. 5/5 <br /> <br />Rmember Me? - This is the only song on the album I don't really care for too much, em's part is great and the other rappers(RBX and STICKY FINGAZ)are decent, yet the song does get old. 3/5 <br /> <br />I'm Back - There isn't much to say about this one except that it sounds pretty average compared to most of the album. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Marshall Mathers - Extremely good song, the lyrics are well thought out and he disses ICP! How cool is that!?! 5/5 <br /> <br />Ken Kaniff - If you remember the \\"Ken skit\\" from the next album, you won't be shocked but other wise, be prepared, this is VERY sick and disturbing, but yet again makes fun of ICP, so it's verygood. 4/5 <br /> <br />Drug Ballad - This song reminds me of something off of his last album, because you guessed it by the title, it's all about drugs, but yes, it's great. 5/5 <br /> <br />Amityville - Woah! I never really cared for Bizarre too much, but he is awesome in this song! Em's second part of the song is also very good! 5/5 <br /> <br />B**** please II - This is the best song off the album because it's got four other awesome rappers in it(Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and Nate Dogg). The whole song is awesome! I just wish Nate had more of the song then the chorous. 5/5 <br /> <br />Kim - This song is NOT for everyone! It can be very hard to handle and is VERY sick, because it's not for everyone, though I love it. 4/5 <br /> <br />Under The Influence - You've never heard D12 this good before! Once again Bizarre is a lot better then he useally is. 5/5 <br /> <br />Criminal - This is the most offensive song off the album! It's very funny and the lyrics are very good, it also makes a great way to close the album. 5/5
0679777547|4.0|There are two threads running through the book, and one comes to a much more satisfying conclusion than the other. I appreciate the art of the red herring, but the one dangled in front of both the reader and the lead, Corso, lost its potency -- especially as the thread that is unrelated to the herring really takes off. <br /> <br />Regardless, I enjoyed the book. I like literary thrillers that intertwine history with fiction. (Although, I think books like this and \\"Da Vinci Code\\" really should include a page at the end that points out what is real and what is the author's construct -- I have met too many people that accept too much in this genre as whole fact.) The characters are expertly drawn, especially Corso and the mysterious young woman. And the obsession that bibliophiles feel for books is also well explored.
0307276902|1.0|Regardless of how powerfully written, when packaged and sold as a \\"memoir\\" this book became an insult to anyone truly struggling with recovery. Why? Because deceit never leads the way to wellness. My mother's step grandson is currently struggling with a serious meth addiction. He is currently in his second in-patient rehab. Meth addiction is harrowing enough without any need to embelish the truth. Truth itself can be grittier than the fiction passed off as reality in this book. And to lie about one's struggle with addiction... to lie about and dramatize the recovery process... belittles all of those who are honestly struggling to salvage their lives. Shame on the author, the publisher, and Oprah for making millions from lies.
B000003GBN|5.0|Upfront bias: I grew up hearing Reiner conduct this music in Orchestra Hall, and I doubt that the memories of those performances will ever really fade. That said, there are few performances that can equal these, much less top them. But as good as the symphonies are, the overtures also remind us of just what Reiner could do with \\"his\\" orchestra. I'm sure that I've never heard the 'Coriolan' performed with more vigor and control. <br />I wouldn't be without the Walter 7th either - but that doesn't mean I admire the Reiner less. Not enough stars for this one.
B0000004F9|4.0|Another nifty 2-fer-1 import CD for your late night listening pleasure. One of the few Soft Machine releases that I actually like.The two albums that have been mastered onto this disc,are 'Vol. 1' ('68) and 'Vol. 2' ('69). Total of thirty tracks with a duration of 74:48, show you just what this Canterbury / jazz art rock ensemble was capable of (in their day). Tunes I enjoyed checking out the most were \\"Hope For Happiness\\", the trippin' \\"Why Am I So Short?\\", their anthem-like \\"Save Yourself\\", \\"Dada Was Here\\" and their tribute to Jimi Hendrix \\"Have You Ever Bean Green?\\". Might appeal to fans of Caravan, Egg, Henry Cow and certain followers of Gong.
B00001ODGR|5.0|When you listen to this living legends they will definitely \\"Styx Like Glue\\". Whether they are singing mellow rock tunes or rocking all the way; the truth of the matter is you are in for a treat. Thank GOD they are still around to feed our appetite in a genre rock form of music.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera releases her most daring album of all time, featuring a lot of very different material than on her previous first self-titled debut! The album contains a lot of various types of music that she sings her entire heart out on, and beginning with the introduction to this album, Christina tells the world that this is the real her, and that this is who she really is, and will not pretend to be something that she absolutely isn't. Christina Aguilera represents herself with much confidence and a lot of bravery that she has the guts to do things her own way, and this album really shows that!
6305205620|5.0|This band is fully charged when it comes to live performance and will definetely pump-up that adrenaline rush through your head.

B0007TKH66|5.0|I just recent finish the first season, and moving on to the second. If you watched the other Star Trek series before, than there's no way you should miss this series. It's like a history lesion of Star Trek, a bridge between all the other Star Trek series and today's modern world. It's pretty cool too see them react to a hologram room, food replicator, tractor beam, photon-torpedo, or using a transporter on a human for the first time while all the previous ST crew took those technologies for granted. Even though I only saw the first season I can tell Archer is the perfect captain for this crew, he acts like a father-figure to the crew, always taking risk, always show compassion for other species. He has the perfect characteristic for an exploration crew trying to fit humanity into the galaxy. If you're new to Star Trek, it is still worth watching, even though you may not know what a \\"Klingon\\" is. Despite your experience with ST, most of the episodes are very thrilling. It always manages to hold my attention. In a tight dilemma when you think there's no way out, they get creative and resourceful, and the result is always a happy ending.
B00008WG3U|5.0|NoFX always make at-least-decent albums, but when they're angry at something or someone, the albums tend to get much better. An great example from a previos album is Dinosaurs Will Die. Well, on this album they're not just angry - they are p-o'ed and it shows. Anger is apparently the single most important ingredient in a punk rock album. It's not without its silly moments though. I doubt NoFX could make an album that was all anger from start to stop. I doubt they'll top this album for a long time to come.
0440224764|2.0|99% of the book was a fun page-turner.  The ending came out of left field, with nothing in the preceding 362 pages of plot and character development suggesting it could end that way.  Just a jarring, grating, train wreck of an ending that spoiled what was otherwise an enjoyable read.
B00001OH7U|5.0|As others have noted, David Bowie was in the ravages of drug addiction while he made this album, and reportedly he remembers little of the actual recording sessions. Even so, it has withstood the test of time and remains one of the best albums of a career that has now spanned four decades.  <br /> <br />The recording opens with the title track, which begins with synthesized train sounds amid sustained feeedback. It builds slowly (introducing the Thin White Duke) until a third into the song the tempo changes and it becomes an incredible rocker. The remaining five tracks are also among his best, and each song has played a part in Bowie's tour set lists over the years. From dance-oriented tracks like Golden Years and Stay, to the beautiful ballad Word on the Wing, there is no weak moment on this album.  <br /> <br />Credit must be given to an absoultely great band: THE Bowie rhythm section of Carlos Alomar, George Murray and Dennis Davis - as great in concert as they were on vinyl, the incomparable Earl Slick on lead, and Roy Bittan, on loan from the E Street Band, on piano. Buy this CD, play it a few times, and if you don't find these songs playing over and over in your head, you must not have been listening.
0671027387|3.0|This book is a disappointment after The Da Vinci Code, but reading it will give you more insight on Dan Brown's writing style. His most adventurous book, it involves much more action than his other books. Still suspenseful and mysterious, it follows the same general plot as his other books.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|This movie begins like so many other horror/thriller movies.  In this case, a woman in the midst of divorce and custody proceedings is moving into a new place with her daughter.  The daughter is apprehensive about the move and the mother reassures her that everything will work out.  We wait for something scary to happen...    The building/setting is indeed spooky, but nothing eventful happens for quite some time.  There are many boring stretches in the film that may not be able to hold your attention.  I honestly gave this movie a chance, but it simply wasn't scary or all that suspenseful.  It reminded me of \\"The Ring\\", but without the good story and lure.    There is plenty of bonus material on the DVD, but it's barely even worth watching people speak with such ferver about a movie that falls so short.
0930289455|5.0|Alan Moore's take on Batman's greatest foe, the Joker, is perfect. Much of the tale is seen through Joker's eyes, so we get to see what makes him tick -- and it is often disturbing. Moore moves seemlessly between current events and flashbacks to Joker's earlier, peaceful years. As Joker's past unfolds, it becomes clear that he has no intention of simply playing pranks. In the middle of the story, he needlessly shoots Barbara Gordon in the spine (which sets up her life as Oracle).<br /><br />Moore also takes a good look at Batman's motivations. He wants to bring in Joker without any killing, but admits that in the end, one of them will have to die. Easily one of the best Bat-stories I have ever read.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I saw this movie about 20 times when it was released in 1976! No other movie comes close. I am so sick of waiting for the DVD release, WHEN OH WHEN are we at least going to get a accurate date of release!!! Please would someone that knows anything please post your info on what is going on! Other than that, what a great movie that stands up to this day. Great music, great acting, and great directing. They got the most out of Kris Kristofferson. Thanks!!! Davy P.
1563898586|5.0|Alan Moore's terrific 19th century adventure story. Cast is a collection of various fictional heroes all brought together in an alternate 1898 London. Mina Murray from Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula,\\" Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's \\"20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea,\\" Alan Quartermain from H. Rider Haggard's \\"King Solomon's Mines,\\" Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" and H. G. Wells' \\"The Invisible Man.\\" The League is directed by a man named M, who may be the brother of Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft.<br /><br />The adventures are fun (Hyde's outbursts are not unlike Ultimate Hulk), but the character interaction really puts this book over the edge. Excellent dialogue sprinkled with plenty of dry, British wit.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I heard about this band through one of my Friends and I'm glad she told me this band is truely very good. I loved the very Show Tunes feel to the Last Five tracks. They are very talented to be able to use the Guitar, Accordian, Organ, and the Piano personally I think that is very impressive to begin with, to be able to put these sounds together well enough to sound cohesive and not overbearing. I loved the nod to the Sound of Music at the end of the CD! <br /> <br />Overall Great CD can't wait to see Panic! at the Disco in Concert! Feb. 17th
0553293397|5.0|Asimov wrote The Naked Sun in 1956 and as others have pointed out here, it is a sequel but a completely independent story from his previous novel, Caves of Steel.  For me, one of the most compelling things about this novel was how prescient Asimov was about how communication technology and technology in general, could isolate society.  There is a passage in which the hero, Elijah Baley, interviews a woman who is a murder suspect on the distant \\"Spacer\\" planet.  He is interviewing her by trimensional viewer - the equivalent of what we would consider a high quality, 3-dimensional webcam projection.  Interestingly, she has no qualms about nudity being viewed in this way.  Yet, like most of the \\"Spacers\\" and particularly those of Solaria, she is strongly abhorrent to actual physical contact and would, of course, never appear in a state of undress in the actual presence of a man like Baley.  In her own words, the fact that Baley is \\"viewing her\\" over the projection and not \\"seeing\\" her in actual proximity makes \\"all the difference there is.\\"  Asimov's thesis here is that having robots to do all the manual labor and having the ability to communicate remotely with so much intimacy that it rivals being in the same room, people are now so remote from one another physically that it takes tremendous effort for them to be in the same house with someone, let alone the same room.  You can see some parallels with how people today communicate with chat, e-mail and webcams across vast distances with a degree of intimacy and familiarity that would not have been possible until recently.  Long-distance relationships can actually be quite intimate, even sexual, due to the improvements in communications technology.  Asimov was visualizing the future of what we are now experiencing some 50 years ago.  I re-read this book now and then with amazement at how well he understood the impact our technology was going to have on our social and political futures.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|As a fan of John's earlier stuff, mostly the non-radio releases, I was anxious to see if he'd really strut his stuff on this album.  It's a must have for Mayer fans, blues enthusiasts, and  overall music lovers.  Track 5, Vultures, and Track 7, Some Other Green, are just amazing.  An overall sexy cd.  What are you waiting for, add Try! to your cart.
0156027321|2.0|The claim that 'This book will make you believe in God' is a bit of a stretch; the book provides an ARGUMENT for believing in God.  Oh well.  I am more of a non-fiction kind of guy and this book just wasn't for me.
0307276902|5.0|Does a book have to be 100% factual to be inspiring? James Frey wrote this story in order to take the romanticism out of drug use and recovery. Before he was exposed as a liar, thousands were inspired by his story and now they all feel \\"duped\\". Obviously lying is wrong but lets be honest with ourselves...WHO DOESN'T LIE! It is understandable for people to be disappointed and feel lied to, but should they suddenly not be touched by this story? Many novels in the past are known for the lessons they teach and the way that they make readers view the world, so why should Frey's \\"memior\\" be any different; especially since it has already greatly impacted numerous people? Fiction or non \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is a fabulous book.
0393324818|5.0|This is a very fun book to read -- the first 2/3 are awesome for everyone, and the final 1/3 is good for baseball afficianados (though the general population might get a bit bored).  I totally recommend!
B000077VR3|4.0|When I first heard about \\"Moulin Rouge\\", I really, REALLY had no interest in it whatsoever, thinking that it is based on one of those bad Broadway shows that the public was bamboozled by Holier-than-thou critics into thinking that they were so great. I, for one, is not into showtunes. Anybody can write a musical, given the sad state of affairs nowadays. Most of the songs sound like something you just make it up as you go along. <br /> <br />When a friend of mine got Moulin Rogue on DVD, once again, I really, REALLY resisted in watching it. For me, musicals began with the Sound of Music and ended with Grease. Yes, a maniacal Madonna fan like me have yet to see EVITA in its entirety, that goes to show you that I HATE musicals in general. <br /> <br />But as my friend watch the movie, I was drawn into the film by the incredible music, and finally, in the entire film itself. <br /> <br />Yes, this hater of musical has been converted. Well, I still hate musicals in general, but when they are as good as Moulin Rouge, I goes into full obsession mode. Yes, I love this movie! The look, the music! And yes...HUNKY Ewan MacGregor has a great singing voice. He did such a great job that it is hard to believe he is the same actor who woodenly plowed through the three Star Wars prequel movies.  <br /> <br />Yes Ewan all is forgiven. <br /> <br />Not to say that Moulin Rouge is perfect. The remake of Like A Virgin was funny until it became a full-blown gay Will & Grace \\"Just Jack\\" production. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is another prime example of why I dislike musicals: it has no discernable melodies. But still, watching Ewan and have his voice seduce you is worth the experience. <br /> <br />Oh, did I mentioned Nicole Kidman? Yes, she is a great singer to. Eat your heart out, Tom Cruise. <br />
B00000JCOV|5.0|Four and a half stars, actually, as some of the more nu-metal tracks don't work that well. <br /> <br />But, in my mind, nothing beats Slipknot for simple hate-the-world thrash that is musically competent with above-average intelligent lyrics and an ability to avoid going over the line to become cheesy, overdone or offensive.  Their self-titled album is easily the best example of their work, as later albums are a little more produced and lose some of the raw edge that these 14 songs possess.  <br /> <br />As far as those songs go, here's the rundown of my favorites: <br /> <br />Diluted, Wait and Bleed, and Me Inside are three great examples of the exploration of a troubled mind alienated from the world. <br /> <br />Prosthetics overcomes a possible serial-killer chic feel to become a genuinely creepy and real song. <br /> <br />Eyeless and SIC are tremendous examples of a tightly compressed and well-put-together package of incoherent rage. <br /> <br />And, finally, the best song on the album, Surfacing, is literally a F-you-all masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|[...] <br /> <br />I did not see this series when it originally aired.  I blame this on bad marketing on Foxes part.  This show is right up my alley.  I remember reading about the series post demise in an article in a magazine.  When it came up for sale cheap, I went ahead and took the chance and bought it.  I have really enjoyed this series as much as any other I have seen.  I now want more, as others do.  I also rented the movie and enjoyed it immensely.  I now want to know what happens to everybody.  Hopefully someone at one of the networks will get a clue and pick up the series again, if that is even an option.  Also if there is another movie, I am there.  Too bad, I wasn't able to enjoy / fight for this show when it originally aired.  We want more!!!!  Yes I am now a firefly advocate!!
6302561841|5.0|This was the first Chaplin film I'd ever seen, and I was astounded by Chaplin's genius. His physicality was simply amazing. The famous scene when he sings in nonsense French is hilarious. Paulette Goddard was stunning.  <br /> <br />A great film!
B00005JOHI|4.0|Okay, I was VERY skeptical of this remaking of P&P.  First off, feature films rarely do a good job of interpreting a book into a 2 hour film (I thought Zefferelli's Jane Eyre was just dreadful!).  I also questioned the casting of Keira Knightley as one of literature's most beloved heroines, Elizabeth Bennett.  I really didn't think she could pull it off.  But she really did. <br /> <br />I'm one of those fans that hold up the BBC/A&E mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the gold standard as adaptations go.  It wasn't perfect, but it was the best I'd seen to-date and I treasure my DVD copy.  And so, it was with fairly low expectations that I went to see this film.  But I must say that I was pretty impressed.  The setting, as others have pointed out, was of a much more rural world where people got dirty and farm animals wander about in the front yard.  I thought the depictions of the Bennett sisters were well done particularly Jena Malone's silly Lydia, Rosamund Pike just luminescent as Jane and Ms Knightly's fine job as Elizabeth.  Brenda Blethyn was a much less flighty Mrs Bennett from the BBC version which was welcome.  But I was not that wild about Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Mr Bennett.  He seemed more willfully neglectful of his daughters than the more benign neglect depicted in the BBC version.   <br /> <br />As for the men, I know that for many Colin Firth IS Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's played him twice after all) but I found Matthew MacFadyen's portrayal more nuanced and sensitive, almost vulnerable than the more cool and haughty Firth version.  I loved him!  MacFadyen interprets Darcy's reserve not as superior hauteur so much as a sort of shyness.  MacFadyen's Darcy seems to be a shy man who is uncomfortable with strangers and, perhaps, in his own skin.  He's attracted to Elizabeth because she is everything he's not.  She's totally comfortable with who she is and her place in the world even if she is often stifled by the social strictures of her day.  Charles Bingley was portrayed as a boyish innocent and one could see why Darcy felt he had to look out for him.  I really felt that the Caroline Bingley character was pretty inconsequential seemingly only there to give Jane the excuse to visit.  But one never got the impression that Caroline even liked Jane in this version so that part was not very well done.  I must confess that the portrayal of Mr Collins had me smiling with serious bemusement!  He wasn't the buffoonish comic relief so much as a bit of an oddity!  But the biggest surprise was what a small part George Wickham played in this story.   <br /> <br />And that is my biggest issue with the film.  Other than Mr MacFadyen, Ms Knightly is the star around which everyone else orbits and as a result, everyone else comes off as fairly minor secondary characters.  As expected, some events are missing or time periods compressed to fit the time requirements of the film.  I suppose it's as faithful as a feature film could be, but it does sort of boil the book down to just the romance between Lizzie and Darcy.  Other issues I had were some of the  costuming which would have been inappropriate at the time.  The almost slip dress that Caroline Bingley wears to the Netherfield ball would have been positively scandalous in the day (a night gown would have shown less skin!).  And gloves would have been worn by both ladies and gentlemen at any social occasion.  And there was also a scene where Lizzie and her sister are shopping in the village and her hair is down around her shoulders.  A young lady of the day would never appear in public without her hair being put up!  And I was very disappointed in the lackluster Lady Catherine DeBurgh this version offered.  Judi Dench is fine, but she lacks the amusingly pompous condescension Lady Catherine had in the book and in the BBC version.  She plays her too regally as my sister pointed out! <br /> <br />Ah well, nothing in life is perfect, but bottom line, I enjoyed thisfilm, I'd see it again and I plan to purchase it on DVD when it comes out.  Highly recommended!
031286504X|5.0|That person wouldn't be me but happens to be my husband. He has a thing for vampire novels and vampire films. So I've heard and seen and read quite a lot about vampires, if only by default, not being nearly as obsessed as he is..at first. Then he got me hooked on Buffy The Vampire Slayer (tv show) and that's when I knew I was getting interested in the vampire thing, the pain of remembering what it was like to be human after crossing into the world of immortality, with its own set of pains.<br /><br />So I moved on from Buffy (and an interlude reading  Interview with the Vampire) and went on to read this book. Couldn't put it down. It floored me. Yep, it IS that good.<br /><br />  It isn't a long book so those of you who don't have the time to tackle a large work will be glad of that...but every word counts, every detail, every nuance. It is also highly original, from the \\" scientific explanation\\" of how vampires came to be to digressions about religion,etc.<br /><br />  In the end, however, it is a good story that generally holds readers' attention and it was the plot that kept me intrigued. I also liked the apocalyptic elements (I'm a sucker for books about the apocalypse, end of the world,etc).<br /><br />  The story? It focuses on a man who is the last guy on earth (but not the last \\"being\\") and his alienation and feelings as he (slowly) traces the history of his life and the deaths of those around him.<br /><br />  I had to keep pausing at points in this book, lost in thought as the writer forced me to confront what it means to be \\"human\\"  and the \\"meaning of life\\" (yep, I know that is pretty deep, but that's the type of book this is, that's where it takes you) and what I'd do in the face of all the obstacles that Neville faced, all the losses and his world gone awry, far off its axis.<br /><br />  Make no mistake - this one has all the elements of good horror writing so if you want to stick to nonfiction or even fiction \\"based\\" on real life, fine... but if you're wishing to push your boundaries, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised (I did). It is  one fine book an an excellent introduction to the vampire genre, even if it isn't predictable or \\"the norm\\".ou might find yourself pleasantly surprised (I did). It is  one fine book an an excellent introduction to the vampire genre, even if it isn't predictable or \\"the norm\\".
B000001IQH|5.0|I bought this album when I was in 2nd grade.  I recently re-bought it and it still as amazing as it was back then.  They are incredible.  It has been 10 years since I bought this, and rebought it, and still the album amazes me.

It looks lik it has a hand with a milion little pisces on it (the cover) but, it is not even James Frey's hand! Why is he (James Frye) lying to us?!? with his hands? I feel so deceptered, and weak.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you haven't seen the series Firefly, it won't matter, but see it anyway.  It brings depth to the movie to know the motivations of the characters. (The DVD set has unaired episodes!)  What the brain-trust at Fox were thinking when they cancelled the series is a mystery. <br />   <br />\\"Serenity\\" is awesome.  Outstanding graphics, excellent plot, well defined and diverse characters, and brilliant acting.  This movie answers questions left hanging from the series, but those answers are framed in a movie that makes sense as a stand alone show.

0307276902|5.0|Within 10 minutes of Oprah's second interview with James Frey I had to turn it off because Oprah made me want to puke.  She has flitted through \\"Spriritual\\" enlightment, having Tom Cruise on who looked like a junkie and preached on Sciencetology, to Jerry Springer shows.  James Frey, hey, if he changed facts in his story, more power to him.  He told a story that I watched my beloved father go through but never knew the dept of his despair that went through his mind.  James Frey opened a deep wound in me that made have so much more respect for people who detox and go through rehab.  My father was the best man I have ever known, had demons that I never knew about until forced rehab.  I watched him take his last breath last October and I saw the awe of everlasting life on his emanciated face.  After 15 years of sobriety, I know that he struggled every day.  James Frey put a fresh face on my undying respect for my father.  So what if he changed things in his life.  Oprah, I have more respect for Martha Stewart and look forward to watching you take a nose dive when you are finally caught.
0553801503|4.0|Yes GRRM is still the King of fantasy writing.  Yes there are times I'm on the edge of my seat, but not enough times for a tomb such as this.  GRRM must be trying to get into the World Guiness Book of records for having the most characters in a series.  However, he is asking way too much for the average reader (say myself) to keep track of who is who plus their parentage.  Just stick to the meat.  The Lannisters, Starks, and Daenerys.  Everything else is just fluff. But truely, this review is hard to do since the book is incomplete.  Now that's power to publish a book that isn't finished.  I think Martin and Stephen King are a part of some secret society where they truely believe that the dumb masses will just buy anything they put out...again in this case (myself)...it's probably true.  So when is the next book coming out?

B00005JOFO|5.0|To say that I was delighted with this movie would be the understatement of this decade. There are 3 scenes that are totally captivating, the rest of this movie leaves you yearning  for more.After an evening of whisky Jack is feeling frisky and makes the first move on an unsuspecting Ennis. What ensues can only be described as an emotional rollercoaster for Ennis. Jumping up quickly, a brief scuffle, and angry almost violent sex (don't worry nothing is showing) He gives in to an obvious temptation. The next day he blows Jack off who is hurting big time. The scene that night in the tent when Ennis goes to Jack is mesmerizing! Apologizing between tender kisses Jack accepts his apology and a romantic interlude ensues. The 3rd of course Is the reunion kiss. Embracing after 4 long years out in the open you could see that they were dangerously near a kiss and both had to slow down, that is until Ennis backs up Jack pushes him against the bulding (strike the music) and bam more pure magic. I would recommend that the first time you see this movie, watch it all the way through. The second and third etc times you see it (once is not enough) leave the theatre happy right after that reunion kiss and imagine the way you may or may not have ended this movie yourself. I am a dreamer, so I want to believe that they got that cattle and calf operation and led \\"the sweet life\\" and lived happily ever after!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is an unbelievable album from start to finish. It is refreshing that a band like Wilco could be so bold as to tell their record label they would make no changes to this album and they were right. It is amazing that albums like this even still get made by major labels. If you love great music buy this cd you will not be disappointed this is a magnificent album. By the way, the Zak Wylde review on here is either the stupidest review ever written on here or someone's attempt(not a very good attempt either) to be witty.
B00007163D|2.0|I am giving this film 2 starts for the acting, which is good. <br />The movie itself was a huge disappointment. It's obvious that the film is based on a play; the way the actors interrupt eachother and repeat certain phrases makes you feel like you're watching a theatre performance. I didn't care for a single character in the film, every line is screamed, every third word is a curse. I felt exhausted half way through and my mind began to wander. Real estate is just not that exciting and if you find it too stressful, get another job.
6304806442|5.0|There are seven artistic moments in my life where i know exactly where and when i was when it happened, in order:  '87 see U2 video for Where the Streets Have No Name; '87 hearing the U2 album The Unforgettable Fire; '91 see Nirvana video for Smells Like Teen Spirit; '92 see Pearl Jam video for Evenflow; '95 seeing the movies Trainspotting and The Usual Suspects; '96 reading Jerzy Kosinski's Blind Date and The Painted Bird; and in '97 reading Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead...<br />  Trainspotting is a moment in time that can't be caught again...Britian was in vogue (music, fashion, and young actors; much like it is again today in '05-06).  The combination of Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Johnny Miller, and Ewen Bremmer is and was unstoppable. The use of noir camera tricks and music and background color and lighting is used to low-budget perfection in this film.  The Scottish language and humor takes at least three times viewing for Americans to pick up.  I don't know if this film romanticizes heroin use or warns of it; but it's a hell of a good film...one anyone could watch over and over and over...and i have, and will keep watching it...what a pace this movie sets...at the end, when the techno music is playing while Renton does his escape move; it's just absolutely perfect, as if you can feel your and Renton's heart beating and picking up speed with the music...absolutely perfect...
0307276902|5.0|I myself loved this book regardless of the newest scandal! I am disappointed in Oprah feeling she had to do her latest show and attempt to humilate and degrade James! This book is a wonderful read.  You feel his pain and his fury!  I could not put it down.  I also knew when reading it that it was probably highly exaggerated in places - but realized that those areas were how James really felt at the time during his journey to hell and in the Fury!  Also he is not the first author to edit the facts to protect others.  Let him add a disclaimer and move on! What a wonderful author and courageous young man.  I wish him the best of luck and hope he continues to write.  Also enjoyed \\"My Friend Leonard\\".
B000001DQG|4.0|This cd is the following to Elton John s' GOOD BYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, his best album ever. \\"Caribou\\" contains the hits \\"The Bith is Back\\" and \\"Don t'let the song go down on me\\". Other songs could have been hits also like, \\"Dixie Lily\\" or the second song from the album. \\"Tickin\\" is the best song, a tragic story about a boy who died on a motorcycle accident. The piano playing, the intensity of the singin and lirics, makes this song his best one, a song he should be playing in concert instead of other songs like the horrible \\"Benny and the Jets\\" or \\"I dont want to go on like this\\"...... <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|You should all be ashamed of yoursevles.  All of you haters, and die-hard core fans out there. Panning Mr. George Lucas just for making a few changes here and there to the Star Wars Trilogy. Changes that aren't even worth complainning about. Even though some are understandable. Han Solo not shooting first and it being that other guy. Not a complaInt. The original actor who played Vader's eye's being changed to blue to match Hayden Christensen's. NOT A COMPLAINT!!!!!!!!!!!! Hayden being replaced as the ghost of Anakin. Now that I can understand people getting upset about.  However, the view pleasure of the Star Wars has not been diminished in any shape or form whatsoever.  The films are still just as great as they were when they first came out in 1977. Besides forget the movie changes, did you see the look of the original teasers and trailers on the supplement disc. OH MY GOD!! Talk about as corny as they get. The only true disappointed to the DVD edition is the fact that ( and Lucas did this same thing for the release of the prequels too.) there's no DTS surround sound track on the disc. But maybe that's just me. I'm a hardcore fan of home theaters. So like I've said already, the Star Wars is still excellent. And for your information as well all of you haters out there in the Star Wars fan base universe if you're listening. THE PREQUELS ROCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND EPISODE 2: ATTACK OF THE CLONES WAS THE BEST ONE. NOW, THERE I'VE FINALLY SAID MY PEACE.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|What can you say about this legendary debut album that hasn't been said before.This new \\"expanded/remastered\\" edition sounds fantastic.The extra songs are new revelations on the early CSN sound.\\"Teach Your Children\\" was transformed by Stills from an<br />English folky tune to the countryfied hit we heard on DEJA VU.I found a few changes on this new CD. Dallas Taylor's picture has inexplicably been stripped out of the back cover.Taylor was such a big part of their early sound & it's kinda sad that he has been removed .Also,at the beginning of \\"49 Bye Byes\\" on the original album , David Crosby did his<br />best Robert Johnson \\"imitation\\" about inviting some babe into his kitchen.THAT intro has been removed.No big deal;doesn't affect the music but,if ain't broke,don't fix it.Highly recommended for the extra songs.A stone cold classic. The apex of Stephen Stills' career.

B000002UA5|5.0|This was one of the first Floyd albums to be remastered and repackaged about ten or eleven years ago, when I first really started coming around to FLOYD. It came with a bitchin' poster, that I still keep on my wall today. If you had to choose between one of its two discs (one is studio, and one is live) I would definately suggest the live side. The disc contains uncontained versions of early FLOYD live circa 1969, back when the show wasn't anymore overly psychedelic, but was still pretty much entirely for acid heads. This is very SPACEY type stuff, with little to know lyrics found anywhere. You can put this on in your bedroom and stare at your lava lamp for hours on end and not even blink once. I used to do it ALL THE TIME!! The four tracks that make up this half of the album are WAY superior and far more complex than their earlier studio counterparts. If you are familiar with the earlier version of ASTRONOMY DOMINE or even the version found on the live PULSE album, be warned... this is a whole different beast! CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE is my absolute favorite, caged insanity, very nasty stuff. By the time you get to SAUCERFUL you'll be too F'd up to know whats going on, but its great too.<br /><br />AS for the studio half, WATCH OUT! It's friggin' bizarre as all get. Highly experimental, you may not be sure what you are listening to. This half was divided into four sections, each composed by a different member. ROGER WATERS boasts longest song title here..(ready?)... SEVERAL SPECIES OF SMALL FURRY ANIMALS GATHERED TOGETHER IN A CAVE AND GROOVING WITH A PICT...its sort of like an orgy of little creatures having a party, while a drunken scottsman watches in awe and spouts gibberish.  The best section, in my opinion, though, is DAVID GILMOURES' THE NARROW WAY. There are lots of fancy guitar tricks going down here, and Gilmoure was the only one to bother with lyrics.<br /><br />I really dig this album, but have to admit it took a while to grow on me. Don't go thinking that its a DARK SIDE or a WALL or even a WISH YOU WERE HERE, cuz its far and away from any of that. This stuff is like waving bye bye to earth, and subtly going insane for about two hours. If thats what your looking for, well then, what are we waiting for?ARK SIDE or a WALL or even a WISH YOU WERE HERE, cuz its far and away from any of that.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Directed by Sam Mendes, Jarhead is about Anthony Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who joins the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in 1989, goes to Saudi Arabia in 1990, sees combat in 1991 in Iraq, and returns home thereafter. Early, during one of the voiceovers in the movie, the title is explained to have two meanings. A \\"jarhead\\" is initially produced visually by headshaving of Marine recruits, but subsequently the head is first emptied of any individuality and then refilled during training. For example, when reporters come to the Marines in Iraq, the commanding officer tells them what to say to the cameras; one Marine remarks \\"Censorship!\\" and another objects that America is a free country; but when cameras roll, the comments are mostly hellos to friends and family back home. Whereas such films as Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) demonstrate the dehumanizing aspects of combat in Vietnam, with the latter explicitly used as a training film in Jarhead, the focus here is on the training and the waiting before the combat. The plot focuses on several Marines in addition to Swoff, who evidently joined to impress a father who got a medal in Vietnam. Troy (played by Peter Sarsgaard) admits that he joined to escape imprisonment, and his criminal instincts sometimes come to the fore. Many of the rest may have joined because they wanted to enjoy the camaraderie of other young men, though their gay tendencies are closeted not only from one another but also from themselves. When Swoff first joins as a new recruit, he is subjected to on-screen bondage, leaving filmviewers to imagine that what follows is gang rape. Soon, Swoff admits in a voiceover that his mouth has become a \\"cum receptacle.\\" On two occasions, several Marines are nude (in the showers, at a victory celebration). Swoff celebrates Christmas eve with a thong; the front is covered with a Santa cap that is pointing, not hanging. For visiting journalists, the Marines simulate gang rape, whereupon the press officer whisks the reporters away. Sadistic, pointless orders are given at several intervals, and punishments are sometimes meted out just for the sadomasochistic pleasure of officers as well as noncoms. Swoff's immediate superior, Staff Sergeant Sykes (played by Jamie Foxx), admits that he enjoys his job, which involves giving orders and playing daddy. The tagline is \\"Welcome to the suck.\\" The combat in Iraq consists of holding a position for \\"four days, four hours, one minute,\\" after which the war is over without so much as a firing of a rifle. What is the point of the film, which strangely lacks a \\"based on a true story\\" title, though the movie is based on a real Anthony Swofford, who wrote A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles (2003), wherein he frankly admits that one of ways of passing the time is to masturbate? One reading of Jarhead is that the plot is an expos about how Marines were trained in 1989, and the death of one during a simple exercise is a clue about the Darwinism that pervades the Marine Corps despite the fact that the training is irrelevant to modern warfare wherein precision firepower wins battles, not hand-to-hand combat. A second purpose, similar to Steven Zeeland's Masculine Marine: Homoeroticism in the U.S. Marine Corps (1996), is to document how the Marine experience is a lot of fun for latent homosexuals. A third insight is that the Marines appeal to those in small towns with no other employable options who are prepared to go to war without knowing why; as Swoff says to the camera, \\"I'm 20 years old, and I was dumb enough to sign a contract.\\" If a purely political statement is found in Jarhead, similar to how Three Kings (1999) portrayed the same war, the message is that the Marines are ill equipped and obsolete. An eloquent scene is the Marine unit's tour of corpses, human and nonhuman, of a military unit that was bombed to smithereens, presumably by friendly fire, on the third day of the war. The final voiceover perhaps provides the best clue, saying that former Marines will never forget the experience and will remain jarheads, with a rifle always a part of their bodies; in other words, military training is a trauma that is unnecessarily dehumanizing and thereafter afflicts the families of former Marines. Accordingly, the Political Film Society nominates Jarhead as best film demonstrating the inferiority of violent forms of conflict resolution and by inference the superiority of peaceful methods.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Classic Pink Floyd with a modern heavy beat. <br />If it was the groups intention to recreate a Floyd feel, they did it.  This is the best Korn to date. What more can I say?  the continued theme thoughout the tracks mesmerizes you and takes you there. I started listening to the CD and didn't move until it was over! Like a really good book, you finish, but wish it to continue.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is my favoret movie of all time. I love the story line and the special effects are alsome. A must see.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a half-psychedelic-half-pop journey that transforms u into a person bright w/ joy and then changes your mood to adepressed sad man! These dual tranformations are frankly worth buying the ticket to the journey.<br /><br />After two extraordinary works of art (The Soft Bulletin & Zaeerika), The Flamings returned w/ this delicious valuable must-have album in 2k2. They prove to be extremely brave in experimenting different materials in both intruments and lyrics. The Soft Bulletin was a full symphonic album w/ less guitar sounds, Yoshimi is electro-pop! Hello!This album can be sliced up to 2 completely different parts : The First part (First 4 tracks)is about a virtual battle between a little girl named Yoshimi and the giant evil pink robots. What i have figured out is that the first track \\"Fight Test\\" is Yoshimi's own thoughts about the battle, the verse sounds alot like Cat Steven's \\"Father And Son\\" which is considered as a lowpoint for the opening track, but the chorus is ok! It can't be an art stealth! Track 2 is about a robot being made! \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots part 1\\" is story teller's recommendations for battle preparation and is a cute pop song. You can play it for your little child (lol). \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots part 2\\" is a great electronic instrumental performance and it simulates the battle scene between Yoshimi and the robots pretty well!<br /><br />When the battle is over (and i still haven't realized whether Yoshimi survived the battle and saved the world or she just died but i could hear hands clapping at the end of the battle and it was humans voices screaming in joy so...) u sink into a deep reverse sky with some fascinating ambient effects (reminds me of Brian Eno's works) and it's about waking up in a dizzy mood after the battle night \\"In The Morning Of The Magicians=20\\". Wayne Coyne's voice is so tired and relaxing here, this song is the album's disjunction point, there are no happy pop songs anymore,\\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" is like a puzzle to me and it's one of the album singles, and \\"Are You A Hypnotist??\\" Oh my god, this song is all about psyche and supernaturalism, it really grew on me, the drum beats are so randomly composed that u cannot follow with headbang, i compare the drumbeats for this song to Radiohead's \\"Pyramid Song\\" it's so unpredictable and beautiful, and the short lyrics shine!!! Here are the lyrics, take a look:<br /><br />((I had forgiven you for tricking me again<br /><br />But I have been tricked again -<br /><br />Into forgiving you -<br /><br />What is this?? Are you some kind of hypnotist??<br /><br />Waving your powers around - the sun eclipse behind the cloud...<br /><br />I thought I recognized your face<br /><br />Amongst all of those strangers -<br /><br />But I am the stranger now<br /><br />Amongst all of the recognized<br /><br />What is this?? Are you some kind of hypnotist??<br /><br />Waving your powers around - the sun eclipse behind the cloud))<br /><br />\\"It's Summertime\\"...the only thing this song duz not remind me of is Summer!! It's about out of space and aliens!! But i can's stop singing along!<br /><br />\\"Do You Realize??\\" yes i do! I realize, i realize that we're floating in space and everyone i know someday will die! The lyrics to this song f***ed me! believe,it's a lifetime advice!<br /><br />\\"All We Have Is Now\\" aliens again, psychedelic and Lynch-style and the last song \\"Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon (Utopia Planitia)\\" is a grammy winner song for best instrumental performance!<br /><br />I think the flaming lips reinvented alternative rock w/ this record. This album is the one to be proud of. The Falaming Lips never went mainstream. Instead they stayed focused on experimenting new material and styles. If u don't believe me, check their Zaeerika album, that album has 4 discs and in order to listen to it u should play them all together at the same time! that's enough experience!<br /><br />at the end of the 90s, U2 stopped pushing the music forward and they started singing songs about africa and gangs of new york!! Here is the flaming lips!!!!ongs about africa and gangs of new york!! Here is the flaming lips!!!!
B000062YB1|5.0|This is Slayer's best album, combining some great thrash songs and some more melodic slow songs. This is an album I'll love until the day I die. <br /> <br />1.

B000001EC1|5.0|Looking for a greatest hit album by Bon Jovi? This is it. His fanatic fans may want you to buy everything they made, but I don't have the will to do that. I especially like the guitar whaling and talking in the remixed \\"Livin on a Prayer\\". Brought back some fond memories of dancing at clubs. It is getting a fair amount of radio play lately. Anyway if you like 70s, 80s, and 90s music, no collection is complete without some Bon Jovi. I recommend this CD to fill in that slot. Granted it doesn't have all his best work, but it has several good ones and the price is definitely right. You are sure to find a couple tunes that will fill that Bon Jovi appetite.
B000AMPZGC|3.0|The actual songs (ie all lyrical ones) on this album are forgettable and boring. The best part about this entire album is the background music such as the haunting,\\"Moon Dance\\". In accepting this the album is worth a purchase for any Elfman fan.
0783230621|5.0|This is a great film. The story line okay but I was mostly suprsied at the special effects. The effects during the final eruption scenes were some of best effects I've ever scene. If you interested in disater films,this is a must see!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Want a different less comedic Batman? I have seen them all and I like this new way of looking at how Batman could have started out. This is a serious look at his beginnings and not comedic like the previous version \\"Batman\\". The support cast which includes Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, and Gary Oldman is excellent. They fill there parts very well. His journey to distant lands as a young man looking for answers to his doubts about himself is a nice touch. The training in marshal arts fits in with his journey to the East. The romance is there but not shallow as in previous versions, and it has an intellectual woman. Good acting, camera work, scenery, special effects, and music make this well worth your time. Don't pass on this because it was not part of the original series.
B000002UAX|5.0|Man I can't get enough of this song Birthday. Yesterday I was listening to this song like 10 times and it is so great. It was <br />before I listened to Abbey Road. And this is the best besides Hey <br />Jude. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a little slow but still a <br />good song. Back in the USSR is good too. The Beatles were a great <br />band, best behind Dire Straits. Go get this album along with The Beatles 1967-70.  <br />Thursday, January 26, 2006
B0000BWVCJ|3.0|Well...its a good movie. All the special fx are very well done and they build up the characters well. But it doesnt make the connection between the comics. I mean, most of the people taht watch it wouldve been familiar with the tv show or the comics, so why didnt they go with the original storyline that was so popular??? Jean isnt meant to just miraculously turn into pheonix, and now theres no room for the back story with rogue for her to get her flight and super strength. If its counted as a seperate movie from the comics/show then its fine, but if you want to see the 'real' x-men then maybe buy the original dvds or comics or something...
B00005JLWN|5.0|<br />First of all, because of the silly artwork many people thought that this movie is a clone of matrix.And matrix was good, (the first one,not the silly sequels)and it is definitelly better in artistic technics.But the thing is , while equilibrium is one of my top 5 films,matrix cant even make it into the list. because despite all the depth, it aims to be an action movie. One with attitude and depth,but an action movie.But equalibrium is depth itself,with action. <br /> <br />Equilibrium stars the great actor Christian bale,who is the newest and the best face of batman.(he made me like batman) The movie is set in near future,in a time where human race stopped their emotions in order to restain balance.Christian bale is a cleric,a champion of the system in charge of protecting it against \\"rebels\\" ; the people who still feel and want to stay that way.Well,what happens happens and christian starts feeling again,and it doesnt take long for him to see what is right and what is wrong.To give the natural balance to humanity,now he has to fight against it. <br /> <br />i'm sure you understood why this movie is always being compared to matrix.. <br /> <br />Equilibrium (the name comes from the building where they buy the thing they inject themselves to stop feeling)has a few logical flaws but nothing important.This great action makes you think about the meaning of being human in ways you probably never did before.it is interesting,original and unique. i hope no one tries to make squels for this one ,cos i still want my money back for reloaded and revolutions :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0307276902|4.0|This book is AMAZING. Frey is clearly a talented writer and even if he went through only a fraction of what he writes, he should still be commended.  <br /> <br />Oprah's recent backtracking on her earlier support of the novel and of Frey is sorely disappointing. Whether or not it is all true, partially true or entirely false, should not change the initial impact she felt when reading it. It was listed as a MEMOIR, not an autobiography. There is a difference for creative license between the two. If any of it is inaccurate, it would hardly be surprising... it is amazing that Frey could remember anything at all! After years of alcohol and substance abuse, he blacked out for long stretches of time nearly every day and going through withdrawl can't be a picnic either. <br /> <br />Truly a riveting read and anyone who picks it up can learn something about themselves, the nature of addiction and the process of healing. <br /> <br />I can't wait to dive into My Friend Leonard.
B000006IUQ|5.0|I finally broke down and bought this after periodically borrowing my mom's copy. I find myself regularly wanting to go back and watch it. If you like survival movies, this is one of the best I have ever seen. If you like great acting, F/X, beautiful locations, cinematography, and music, here you have it. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are both magnificent as rich boss and executive going on an adventure photo expedition in Alaska. When Hopkins finds out that photographer, Baldwin, is having an affair with his model wife. It gets frosty between them. While taking a flight together their bush plane crashes in a remote area and they must find their way back to civilization. When a huge bear attacks a companion with them and then follows them relentlessly the priorities change. A game of who is the real survivor and how to be attacked by a bear and survive. Hopkin's and Baldwin's mental and physical abilities are tested to the edge. Irony abounds as the stronger younger man may not be the best suited to a hostile environment. Great movie and one I highly recommend.<br /><br />Blu-ray Addendum:  I just got my Blu-ray version 4/12/2013.  The picture and sound are superior and any fan that has the DVD should get the Blu-ray version.  This was a beautifully shot movie before and the level of detail in the Blu-ray is simply amazing.  I'm a bit disappointed it doesn't have special features, but the movie and the price make up for it.<br /><br />CA Luster
0307276902|1.0|Three cheers for Oprah - not because she went on the air and admitted making a mistake- but because she made Frey see that he made the mistake. I think that he is a confused and obviously still disturbed person who is still dealing with some of his own demons.   <br />That said, I was TOTALLY DISGUSTED by the publisher Nan - she sat there grinning like a Cheshire Cat and letting Frey take all the heat - putting herself \\"above\\" error.  I feel a little sorry for Frey, but there is no excuse for publisher Nan - who just lied and made excuses and blamed other people right to the end. On the one hand she said she had no \\"right\\"  to question the memory of an author like Frey - then she turns around and says she has turned down \\"a ton\\" of other memoirs because she questioned their authenticity! She talked out of both sides of her mouth, grinned through the whole interview as if it was a joke, and she's a terrible example for any young women wanting to go into the publishing business. I'm glad Oprah exposed her!
0553801503|4.0|Readers will be disappointed, even feel betrayed, by the lack of involvement with their favorite characters.  It very much feels like you're reading the first book of a series because there are so many new characters.  If there's one thing Martin is brilliant at, it's developing characters.  Give them a chance.  Get to know them.  Half way through the book you'll realized you've become very engaged with them.  I can say I definitely liked this book as well as the first three.  The character development is amazing.  I give it 5 stars because Martin does such a good job of making you deeply hate a character and wanting them to die and then by the end of the book you have completely changed your mind.  You don't feel hate, but pity and sorrow, and you are so emotionally involved with them it almost breaks your heart.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|It seems there is some sort of contest here between Martine McCutcheon and Keira Knightley. <br /> <br />Well, although I am an extremely straight woman who adores men, let me cast my vote for Martine McCutcheon.  <br />Just \\"google\\" her name and you will see from top-to-bottom/back-to-front why this sexy, beautiful, vivacious woman beats out Ms. Knightley. <br /> <br />Cheers.
0688170528|5.0|This book was impossible for me to put down, meaning that in the week it took me to read it, I neglected two other books in progress!  Picoult weaves a beautiful tale of love and to what lengths people (boyfriends, girlfriends, soul mates, spouses, mothers and fathers) will go for the sake of the love they feel for another person.  Picoult mixes in so much meat into her themes -- making for a satisfying reading experience.  Little snippets in the book (e.g. James Harte's experience with his aging, sick hunting dog) -- seemingly \\"beside the point\\" -- are hidden treasures that make this story really rich.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I have never seen a film that got me involved on such a deep level of creativity. Every single scene change was deeply thought out. Every line, action, outfit, setting, and even extras were deeply thought out. This is the most impressive directing and writing I can remember seeing. See this movie. Listen to Marc Forster's Podcast on Itunes and do your research to get more enjoyment out of every little fact about the film.
031286504X|5.0|All you have to do is check the quotes from guys like Stephen King and Dean Koontz to see how important this was to writers and the horror genre in regards to popular modern fiction but also George Romero has said that after reading I AM LEGEND he sat down and compulsively wrote the original treatment for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, so it could be argued that I AM LEGEND is perhaps the most influential novel of its type written in the 2nd half of the 20th century; it is easy to underestimate the lasting influence it has had on not only  horror fiction but cinema and pop culture in general. Think about it: every zombie movie ever made after Romero's owes something to him and therefore something to I AM LEGEND. This is just begging to be adapted for the screen again; this time maybe doing it right; the first version starring Vincent Price is surprisingly faithful to the book but under-budgeted and limply shot and performed (it kills me to say that, but Vincent price seems bored and half-hearted in his performace and the movie drags) and THE OMEGA MAN really had nothing to do with I AM LEGEND. I was thrilled when, a few years back, it was rumored to be in the works with Ridley Scott directing but in almost the same breathe it was announced that first ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (please, no!) and then Will Smith (again, please no!) were \\"attached\\" and my hopes were dashed as that surely would have led to another misfire like The Omega Man.  To me this book has always seemed to be more about the psychological effects of lonliness and isolation than it is about pitched battles between Robert Neville and hordes of bloodsucking freaks. Perhaps Danny Boyle is the only artist currently working in the Cinema who has the right sense of story and style to do this one justice, judging from \\"28 Days later.\\"
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Nicholas Cage seems to do the classic (although now somewhat uncommon) practice of making a highly commercial movie to pay the bills, followed by a more interesting, more arty film. Lord of War is one of those artier films, but it has the ability to cross over to audiences who don't normally think of themselves as enjoying such movies. Think of it as the Goodfellas of gun-running.<br /><br />Lord of War is a blend of comedy and drama, weighted on the dramatic side, telling the whirlwind story of how a boy from Brighton Beach became one of the world's biggest arms dealers. The movie moves too fast for us ever to learn much about most of the characters, but the actors are mostly up to the cast, sketching out their characters in a few quick strokes that suggest hidden detail the viewer never gets to see.<br /><br />In particular, Jared Leto plays Yuri's younger brother who is tormented by the morality of their livelihood. Leto sinks his teeth into an arguably underwritten role and serves as the canary in the moral coalmine.<br /><br />Cage is his typical mix of manic and obsessive in a role where both work, and Bridget Moynahan is radiant while still bringing gravity to her role later in the film.<br /><br />The movie has no easy answers for the moral questions it raises.<br /><br />A solid recommendation for fans of intelligent crime movies, Nicholas Cage and Bridget Moynahan.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles' FAREWELL I TOUR- LIVE FROM MELBOURNE is great. The baggage involving Don Felder seems to have been lifted by the presence of his replacement, Steuart Smith, and, from a tape of the show made for me before I owned this DVD, I see that the band is playing the old songs better than they have in a long time, as well as throwing in a few new ones. The best of the latter is Joe Walsh's \\"One Day At A Time\\", which he says is about his recovery from alcoholism, but could be about getting over ANY addiction. In fact, the song has inspired me to put up pictures of pretty celebrities on my wall as a deterrent to falling back into old compulsive eating habits. This DVD is highly recommended to all fans of 70s rock.
B000005S6H|5.0|I was never a fan of the music that Nick Cave made with The Birthday Party,(though I am basicaly a hard rocker at heart) and had always considered him to be a bit of a phony, until I heard this album.The whole emotional depth of all the songs, and the way in which they are executed by Nick and the band make this album a treasure.Whenever Im feeling low I can put this album on,have a beer and feel like im sitting down with an old friend who understands my pain.Its one of those albums that will never date, kind of like an old earthy peice of wood or a good bottle of wine.I must say that after buying this album I have completely changed my whole view on Nick Cave. No matter what music you are into, I would reccomend giving this a listen, especially if you are feeling hurt over a busted relationship or a marriage.Its very soothing yet it still has a slight edge of defiance about it, and is not in the least bit contrived.(or phony!)
B00015HV1A|5.0|This album epitomizes the beginning and short life (including Bolan  himself) of the glam era in rock music in the early 70s. <br /> <br />Marc Bolan and Tyrannosaurus Rex (shortened to T-Rex) led the way, along with other mostly British bands, such as Mott The Hoople, David Bowie, Slade, Queen, Pretty Things, the Kinks, and to some degree, American bands, such as Kiss, Alice Cooper, and The New York Dolls. <br /> <br />These groups added a somewhat feminine, gender bending touch to their music, and their onstage costumes, as well as wearing makeup   and glitter. <br /> <br />Songs on the Electric Warrior album that became hits in the US: <br /> <br />Jeepster, Life's A Gas, Bang A Gong (get it on) which had been redux MANY times later in the 80s by groups such as Power Station, Chic (disco version) Blondie, Duran Duran, ect...  and Rip Off (considering the previous song, how appropriate!!) <br /> <br />If you want to get a glimpse of the early seventies, check out the DVD video on the disc of T-Rex performing the song Bang A Gong, as the audience is made up of mainly young women dancing to the song, (or is that swaying to it?? ;) Go-Go boots and miniskirts, oh my!!
B000301YY8|4.0|I am not a frequent purchaser of CD's, but the hauntingly beautiful video/song by James Blunt had me rushing out to purchase Back to Bedlam.  His vocals are unique, and for a debut CD, the majority of the songs are better than average.  A few stand out and may actually grab you and make you cry.  Goodbye My Lover and No Bravery are gut-wrenching, raw, emotional compositions, unlike any songs or vocals I have heard in a very long time.  No Bravery may well become the anti-war song of our new age.
B00005R26U|5.0|From what I saw on a tape made of this show before I owned this VHS, I can tell that Bruce Springsteen is very happy to be back with the E Street Band. The show has the feel of a religious service, with the Boss and his band, including wife/background singer Patti Scialfa and both Steve Van Zandt AND Nils Lofgren on guitars, testifying like nobody's business. It took a lot of guts for Springsteen to perform \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" in protest against police officers shooting an innocent person, but he pulled it off by hushing the whole audience. This show paved the way for the great CD/cassette THE RISING. Any classic rock fan MUST own this VHS/DVD.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|This album sucks bad.  Nothing about it is any good whatsoever.  Dont wast your money on it, and dont waste your time downloading it.  First of all, Korn sucks.  They think they are cool because they spell theyre name with a backwards R and a mispelled word, but who cares, your not cool, your music sucks, and you should stop making it.  I think this album should be removed from the market to prevent any other poor young kids from hearing this garbage.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|This has to be one of the best metal albums I've ever heard, next to Blind Guardian's Imaginations From the Other Side. <br /> <br />Holy Wars... the Punishment Due - 10/10 Incredible, great solo's and outstanding riffs. Probably my favorite song.  <br /> <br />Hanger 18 - 9.5/10 THE song for metal guitar solo's. <br /> <br />Take No Prisoners - 9/10 Great intro riff and a nice chorus. <br /> <br />Five Magics - 8.5/10 Cool and a little unusual sounding instrumental intro and a decent second half <br /> <br />Poison Was The Cure - 9/10 This song would be a 10/10 if the first minute was just taken out and the second part were the entire song. The dual guitars are interwoven to produce such a fast thrashy sound, it's amazing. <br /> <br />Lucretia - 9/10 Just in general a very good song. <br /> <br />Tornado of Souls - 9.9/10 Great riffage and chorus, not to mention one of my favorite solo's ever! Not a 10/10 because it can't be equal to Holy Wars. <br /> <br />Dawn Patrol - 4/10 Meh, I think of it as an intro to Rust In Peace... Polaris. I wont penalize an album for bad songs... they can just be skipped. <br /> <br />Rust In Peace... Polaris - 9.5/10 A very strong song.
0307276902|1.0|I was reading this book since the hype surrounding the book has been incredible, but once the allegations came out and Oprah announced her astonishment at the discovery of all the book's lies that make it more fiction than non-fiction I have to say that I feel really bad towards those that are recovering addicts whose stories will be forever doubted and full of questionable comments, thanks to James Frey.
B00005JOFO|5.0|My first impression when I was watching \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" was that I was being underwhelmed.  The film was receiving universal raves and the public debate about the movie had started to turn to something of a backlash with the argument being that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal should not praised as being brave for playing gay lovers because we are so far past the point when we can make any judgments about an actor's sexual orientation based on the roles we play.  That seems especially clear when this film wins the Golden Globe for best drama and the two top acting awards go to Philip Seymour Hoffman and Felicity Huffman for playing a gay man and a transgender man.  So the point being made about courage is valid enough, but given that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will be the most successful film to have love scenes between two men it does represent a hurdle of sort in American pop culture.<br /><br />It took me a while after watching this film to decide that the best parts of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" are not the acting but rather the writing, directing, and music.  This is not to take anything away from the cast, but consider that the script does not really give them the sort of memorable acting moments that win people awards.  Ledger's character of Ennis Del Mar is wired so tight that his emotions barely constitute ripples on his surface.  As his wife, Alma, Michelle Williams is forced to put off her eruption over her husband's infidelities with another man for years.  The contrast between Ledger and Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is that of ice and fire on the surface, and despite the passion that exists between the two men the story arc here is about Jack's efforts to get Ennis to thaw enough so that they can have it all rather than steal moments.<br /><br />I give the major credit for this film to the screenplay by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, based on the short story by Annie Proulx.  When a novel is adapted to the screen there is always so much left out, but with the source here being a short story there are hole, spaces of time really, built into the story.  The film provides sketches of the relationship between Ennis and Jack.  After the first sexual encounter between the two men, we never see that degree of intimacy again, and that leaves open the question of what sort of relationship they had.  I found myself wondering if the two achieved a level of reciprocity or if things continued along the same line.  My interest was not prurient, but rather a question of wanting to understand the character of Ennis and to know if he ever let himself be vulnerable in any way that another human being could tell.  Or did that moment come when he was literally all alone in Jack's bedroom?<br /><br />Consequently the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto and the music of Gustavo Santaolalla become critical in filling in the gaps in the narrative.  Images and music end up revealing more than words and it is significant that when the depth of the love between Ennis and Jack is revealed that there is only images and music, and not a word is spoken.  The credit that is due director Ang Lee ultimately has to do with bringing these people together to make this movie and tell this story in this particular way.  In an age when a digital screen can be filled with a million images fueled by a combination of imagination and computers, there is something to be said for the sparseness of this film, and not just the idea that less is more.  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" creates a elusive blend of intimacy and distance that actively compels its audience to make sense of it all and to find the truth the characters are reluctant if not unable to face.  Ennis will not tell us the depth of this tragedy.  That judgment is left to us.a short story there are hole, spaces of time really, built into the story.

6305181772|4.0|\\"Mission Impossible\\" is one cool movie.  It's a movie for<br /><br />A. Those who like non stop action<br /><br />B. A movie with a cool plot line (but be aware the plot can get kind of confusing, I had to watch through two or three times to completly get the whole plot.)<br /><br />C. Tom Cruise lovers,  This is one the better Tom Cruise movies, and it's also a good movie for those who like Ving Rhames, and Jon Voight, they both played great roles in this movie as well.<br /><br />This truly is a good movie, and for all the action in it, you will notice very little if any language, and no nudity or sexual refrences.  So it's a great action movie for adults and teenagers.
0694010081|5.0|Our 7 and 8 year old boys each had their own \\"Goodnight Moon\\" books. When our baby girl arrived a year and a half ago, we read one of the boys' books to her until we realized it was the ONLY book she wanted to hear. At 4 mos. when we'd try to read some of our other family favorites (Guess How Much I Love You, Wheels on the Bus, Chicka Chick Boom Boom and other GREAT classics) she would actually lean forward and shove the book away.  She'd continue to do so until we'd pick up Goodnight Moon. Needless to say, the \\"old copies\\" were bound to get pretty ratty with so much use so we asked Santa to bring her a Goodnight Moon of her very own. She was so thrilled and she LOVED the bunny slippers. Unfortunately, the slippers were a bit too small but she'd squish her feet in them and waddle around anyway! Now, I've convinced her that her big dolly has cold feet so dolly is allowed to wear the adorable slippers! And, while we still sit down and turn the pages of \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and read it the \\"traditional\\" way every now and then, it's become a nightly ritual -- after prayers and \\"tuck in\\" -- to recite (from memory) the story as we tiptoe out of the room. By the time we reach \\"goodnight nobody\\" our baby's eyes are closed and we don't hear another peep till morning. God bless Margaret Wise Brown!
B000AAF1U4|3.0|The \\"Emperor's New Groove\\" really is a neat little movie.  Usually Disney has the same plotline that they just repackage every year or so, but this movie is a total break from that.<br /><br />To say this movie is quirky is not telling the whole story.  It looks more and feels more like an independent arthouse movie.  The animation is sleek and modern, and the script is extremly clever.<br /><br />The Cast fills the roles perfectly,<br /><br />Don't miss this movie!
1565847032|4.0|As others say here, this rather long book weaves beautifully connecting about all the dots, and is really a rather easy read, since the professor is mainly answering questions presented at forums thruout the USA. Basically, he blasts away at the military-industrial complex, though he hardly ever uses that term, first formulated in 1960 by Eisenhower. Since the Defense Dept. receives over 50% of federal taxes, and is responsible for dropping so many hundreds of thousands of bombs, slaughtering at least as many people in overseas military adventures, his thoughts on this subject are deep and near limitless. So why is so much spent on bombs, missiles, and planes rather on schools and medicine? According to the author, mainly since if spent on the latter, citizens would have a say, which is the last thing the gov't wants! And the media is almost totally muzzled! On this point, as on others, he may simplify things a bit, the reason I humbly give this book only 4 stars! His comments on Central America in the 1980's, Russia and South America are on target, and his humor makes his comments, and the book, even more effective! Like \\"People in Guatamala would find Bulgaria a real paradise!\\". His also excorciates the universities, and many other large institutions.  Other reviewers make some fine points too, so I'll kep this review short, and simply end by saying this is definitely territic \\"anti-establishment\\" read, and you won't regret your time spent!
B00003CXCT|2.0|Who remembers a time when Star Wars was magical and unique and each new movie was better than the last (the first time) and really felt as if you knew the characters, as if they were special to only you and no one could evr possibly understand the realtionship you had with Princess Leia? Did you ever get jealous listening to someone bash HAn or angry when someone called Luke a sissy? <br /> <br />I remember those days, but George Lucas obviously does not. The man is insufferable. The dreadful and ....oh god! it gives me shivers just thinkig about them.....heinous, unnecessary changes that were made in 1997 were not enough. As if the crimes of a Jabba the Hutt in Mos Eisley regurgitating Greedo and Han Lines, a replacement for Lapti Nek with Jedi Rocks!?! (Jesus! George were you smoking the reefer?)and the Sarlacc Worm creature that drastically changes that entire scene? Were they no enough George that you had to go and screw it up yet a second time!?! <br /> <br />Well I am sad to say it has happened. Star Wars has hit rock-bottom. Now on top of the abovementioned crimes, we must also endure Hayden Christensen yet again in Return of the Jedi, Ian McDiarmid in Empire, a role he did NOT originally play! and Boba Fett redubbed to sound like Jango from Attack of the Clones! Doesn't anyone else find that wrong? What if someone remastered Gone With the Wind and added new digitally enhanced scenes and redid dialogue? Wouldn't someone be outraged? I would complain to George but I think he's too busy counting all the money he's earned from this release and snorting the booger sugar? <br />Damn, man get a grip! <br /> <br />I refuse to buy this DVD set, not only because of the trashjob remakesof stellar films but because the special features are...well not at par. You get like four hours of material. Big deal. You want special features? get the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings? At least Peter was kind enough to release both the ORIGINAL and the EXTENDED editions onDVD. Lucas well, he's not so fan-sensitive, we've become aware. <br /> <br />oh, well. I reommend purchasing the VHS versions of the original trilogy. They weren't lying when they said \\"The Star Wars trilogy...available to own for the very last time.\\" How prophetic. It really is the only way you'll be able to see Star Wars the way we remember, the way we love and not be dissapointed.
B000003TA4|1.0|Yes kurt did ruin rock music and he was the one responsible for every terrible rock genre you seen on the radio (Nu Metal, Emo, Pop Punk, New Alternative) although Nirvana did change the face of music, they also destroyed, now it's nothing more than a whining hyena thanks to this band, I Blame nirvana for every single thing that's wrong with rock from the 1990's to present, from this release to nu metal, pop punk, emo and other trendy crap (while good grunge bands like pearl jam & alice in chains get pushed aside)and then finally the worst thing to ever happen to modern rock St. Anger, The Greatest Metal Band ever made Metallica died in a very shameful and horrible death in the worse way's possible (Nu Metal), Smells like teen spirit was pathetic and about a girl was the only good song on the album <br /> <br />The Musicians are terrible (with the exception of Dave Grohl who moved on to better and way better things) and what makes me even sicker than rolling stone magazine put kurt over eddie van halen, Carlos santana, randy rhodes as the best guitarist of all time. <br /> <br />Nirvana really ruined rock and roll and paved the way for terribleness for the next 15 years and for that I Will never forgive them. <br />
0312305060|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  Cunningham's description of emotions are the farthest from contrived or cliche they can be!  An amazing writer who really captures the uncapturable.  <br /> <br />Also, an example why some books should never be made into movies!
1932100385|5.0|I have tried the following diets, all with initial success: <br /> <br />The Zone <br />Body For Life <br />South Beach <br /> <br />In every case I quit because I just plain felt terrible after a while. In December  I decided to try vegetarianism for 30 days and never looked back. I've lost 11 pounds eating AS MUCH AS I WANT and never felt better. My blood pressure dropped from 140/124 to 117/75 in 2 weeks.  Why didn't my doctors reccomend this for me? They recommended Beta Blockers and Statins. For a 29 year old! No way. I want to live, not become a 40 year annuity for some pharmaceutical company.  <br /> <br />Before I read this book, I thought my experience was unique. I was both excited and angry to find out that the scientific data overwhemingly would have predicted my experience. Plant based diets heal diseases of affluence (heart disease, diabetes, cancer)in humans. Its that simple. <br /> <br />I have read other books on vegetarianism (Food Revolution, Harvest For Hope, Animal Liberation) and they always seemed a bit partisan to me. I'm all for compassion, but health is my primary concern. Cambell is so thorough in his exposition of the data, from his own studies and many others, that it is difficult to see food through the same lens ever again. Cambell is not a tree hugging activist, or a vitamin salesman. He is not a political partisan. He is Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University.  <br /> <br />So why doesn't every doctor and health organization get behind Cambell's recommendations? Simple. Some want your money. And some don't believe you can do it. If you read Cambpell's book, it may just give you the motivation to give it a try. At least for 30 days.
B000002P5W|5.0|Most casual fans of Hendrix will want to purchase Are You Experienced? or a Best of Hendrix compilation, but true Hendrix fans will want to purchase all three of his albums with the Experience, if for no other reason than to hear the remarkably quick metamorphosis of Hendrix' songwriting from that of Psychedelic Blues Rock pop-length tracks to the more \\"concept-album\\"-oriented sound of both this album and its successor, Electric Ladyland. Just about every track on this album (with the exception of \\"She's So Fine\\") is worthy of mention, most notably \\"Bold As Love\\", \\"If 6 was 9\\", \\"Castles Made of Sand\\", and \\"Little Wing\\". Also worthy of mention are \\"Little Miss Lover\\", a damned funky number and one which serves as a signpost offering the direction his music would take after leaving the Experience, and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", a psychedelic romp fueled by heavily distorted guitar while at the same time hearkening back to Are You Experienced? in terms of general sonic feel. An essential album for Hendrix fans, but you should go get Electric Ladyland too, as well as his Band of Gypsys album with Buddy Miles.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Well after listening to FIOE in the car, at work, at the gym, on my ipod...I have to say I love it and I can't stop playing it!  <br /> <br />It's a bit different from their previous 2 albums but it's still The Strokes, just a bit older maybe. The lyrics are very clever, and I love the sarcasm of \\"Ask Me Anything\\". \\"I've got nothing to say...\\"   <br /> <br />My absolute favorite tracks are \\"You Only Live Once\\", \\"Ize of the World\\" (it's got the most brilliant guitar solo!)it's just WOW, \\"Fear of Sleep\\"(you're no fuuuuuuuuun!) and the retroish \\"Electricityscape\\". \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is completely different from the rest of the album but so good! Another great track is \\"15 Minutes\\", I just love how it starts off slow and starts picking up speed towards the end. So basically, I love each and every song 'cuz they're all unique in their own way.  <br /> <br />I have to be honest, I kinda doubted this album would be any good. With all the bad reviews and the fact that they changed producers...bla bla bla but I was wrong. The Strokes have once again created a masterpiece!
B000024D4R|5.0|Floyd has other albums which garner more attention than this one: notably, Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon and of course, The Wall. However, Animals stands beside those (rather than behind and slightly to the left) as yet another great concept album from a band known for concept albums. Animals strives to associate different personality types with specific animals: Sheep are the stupid following masses, Dogs are the takers, the wolves in sheeps clothing that look to take power, and Pigs are the greedy fat upper crust of society. I think (?) Pigs on the Wing represents the few people which break free of these groups, as rare as this may be (like Pigs Flying). As far as the music goes, this is Floyd painting their Floydian sound worlds to the nth degree, albeit in a more guitar-oriented way than either of the two previous albums, which relied heavily on keyboard accompaniment in terms of compositional style. However, this is no knock, as Gilmour has rarely sounded better (his work on Dogs is particularly noteworthy for his restraint and perfect technique). Each of the major tunes (Dogs, Pigs and Sheep) strive to immerse the listener in the world of the song, and each of these songs also seem to feature similar vamps which tie the entire album together in an amalgam of human misery and hypocrisy. A worthy purchase, as you can already see the dark madness which engulfed Waters on The Wall starting to take hold here, which makes the progression all the more palpable.  A must-have for Floyd fans or fans of Classic Rock in general.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club, for many years now, has been one of those movies that challenges many genre's of movie-making.  With the combination of action, dark humor/satire, drama, a bit of adventure, and wicked turns on love and heartbreak, this movie tests the boundaries over critics and other directors.  David Fincher, who also did SE7EN (THUMBS UP), The Game, and Alien3 (his first movie feature), Fincher has proven himself worthy of being one of the greatest directors after improving his skills of the rather dissapointing, last film, of the Alien franchise.  You have Brad Pitt, who is a loose cannon in the act of proving his \\"friend\\" that he is everything he is not as he FIGHTS his way through his own problems throughout the movie.  You have Edward Norton, who is referred to as 'Jack', making up his imaginary friend, Tyler Durden, to help him become...Shall we say, stronger as he tries to find out that HE WAS Tyler Durden through all of his kicking and screaming with Tyler Durden.  Other characters, such as Jared Leto (Angel Face) and Meat Load Aday (Robert Pulsen), play more smaller roles, but Meat Loaf's character helped make Fight Club hilarious in the most sickest ways.  I remember reading about how many bad reviews Fight Club got (The Collector's Edition has a thick booklet with most of them).  Some of them were funny and some of them simply tore the movie in half.  David Fincher gave no apologies to how offensive the movie got towards some issues and towards other questionable parts of the movie...If I was the director, I would've given no apologies either cause Fight Club was an excellent movie to watch and witness and was definitely a breakthrough for Fincher, along with Pitt and Norton.
0066620996|5.0|Why do some companies succeed - again and again - while their competitors do not?  Is it luck?  A charismatic leader?  Something special about the culture?  A razor-like focus on the bottom line?  Anyone who wants to know the answer to these questions will benefit from reading this book.  Jim Collins and others have researched thousands of companies and come up with a group of 11 that went from good to great and have now demonstrated continued success.  From their studies, Collins has uncovered a number of surprising findings, some of them non-intuitive: <br /> <br />-Great leaders aren't necessarily charismatic, and are more often quiet but strong <br /> <br />-Great companies don't always start with a transformative idea <br /> <br />-Great companies don't always have a formal business strategy <br /> <br />Plus many others. <br /> <br />I found Good to Great to be a fascinating look at the 11 companies profiled and an interesting challenge to some of my preconceptions of what makes a company great.  Anyone who is interested in business or in leading an organization will find it well worth the time spent. <br />
B00005JKG9|5.0|I can't believe I never saw this movie until 2 years ago! I always thought it had a weird name and would probably be boring (Shawshank Redemption's creeped some people out too), but was I ever wrong! I thought the name had something to do with Glenn Close!<br /><br />This film is simply fantastic, featuring an all-star cast and outstanding performances. If you haven't seen it, BUY THIS DVD NOW. You're in for a real cinematic treat. And it's only $10.<br />You get: 2 versions of the film (widescreen on Disc 1 and fullscreen on disc 2.. but who watches fullscreeen anymore?!). Disc 1: 3 audio tracks (different versions of Dolby surround) and 1 in French, a director's commentary track, and a 30 minute tribute to Jack Lemmon. (The Simpsons is always a good guage for the impact a work has on popular culture. The Gil character (failed salesman) is based on Jack Lemmon's Shelley in this film.) The 30 min tribute is kind of dry.. just a bunch of actors talking about Lemmon's work and life against a white screen.<br /><br />Most of the bonus material is on Disc 2. It's a bit strange how the DVD makers divided it all up and didn't put all that on Disc 1. I guess the widescreen version of the film took up too much room, but no complaints here. You get a good amount of bonus stuff. An \\"ABC\\" sales industry documentary (30 mins), another biography of a furniture salesman, 10 minute Charlie Rose clip, a very funny \\"Go to Lunch\\" bit with Kevin Spacey at an acting workshop, production notes, cast biographies, and bonus commentary from the cinematographer, Alec Baldwin, and 3 or 4 other members of the cast and crew (varying lengths). I haven't watched/listened to most of the features yet, but Baldwin's commentary offers some real insights into the movie industry and this film. He's someone I admire greatly and it's a joy to listen to him.<br /><br />I'm editing this review after I read another person's comments. I agree with another reviewer who was let down by this SE release. This is one of my top 10 or 20 films and there should've been more. (How about the original Mamet play, commentaries from Spacey, Pacino, Lemmon, or Ed Harris?). For $10, I can't really complain. Diehard fans of this film may be disappointed if they expect too much and compare this to some of the best SE DVDs out there. The number of features on this DVD is on par with other DVDs. Of course, it could've been done a lot better, given how many people love this film. I still give it a 5. $10 is not a lot to pay, and I guarantee you will be watching this film over and over again.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|Wow wear to begin. The movie had some hope untill johny came on...With the lame jokes...Horrible performance....And must i say they got rid of the good oompa loompa look? Instead they use only ONE person and multiply him a hundred times. Yes the same exact person. The songs continuesly interupt the movie which they suck badly. The only way you will enjoy this movie is if you are stoned completely.
B00005JOFO|5.0|As in, I cried for the last ten minutes straight.  I rarely cry in movies, unless they are truly devastating and from when Jack said \\"I don't kow how to quit you\\" up until the last frame, I was bawling.  This movie was spectacular.  It was less about sex, and more about how the denial of love and of passion slowly corrodes Jack and Ennis from the inside out.  The acting was magnificent, especially Heath Ledger.  When he and Jack were first reunited after 4 years, the smile on his face and his excitement at seeing his old fishing buddy was the cutest thing I have ever seen. He just smoldered through the whole film.  I had to cross state lines to see this film (\\"community standards\\" prevented it from being played where I live)and the ride, toll, and exorbitant ticket price were all worth it.
B000002J27|5.0|I admit, I am not a huge Genesis fan.  Like some of their Peter Gabriel stuff, could leave a lot of it.  Same with the later more pop-oriented stuff, like some, not all.  But this album is great!  The first after Gabriel left the band, one can guesss the remaining four bandmates, Phil Collins, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks wanted to prove there was more to the group than PG.  All the tunes are great.  Entangled and Ripples are beautiful songs, Dance on a Volcano rocks, and Robbery Assault and Battery is a song that puts a smile (or at least a smirk) on your face.  The tracks are well produced considering the year of recording.  I strongly recommend this CD.  It is so good I consider it one of my desert island disks.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|This film, above all things, is an insightful look at what the world has come to.  To see the conditions of those living in Africa is enough to make you tear up, but to see the common disregard by those of higher economic living is even more painful to see.  The film revolves around Justin Quayle (Fiennes) as he searches for answers to his wifes brutal murder.  What he uncovers is that his wife Tessa (Weisz) and her friend Arthur (McCabe) have been working to uncover a conspiracy involving big drug companys and their iligal and unethical testing on African's.  As Justin digs deeper to uncover th truth he finds himself playing a game with his life, and he finds that everyone he trusted, everyone he loved may in fact be working against him.  No one is what they seem and just when you least expect it they will show you their true colors.  Supporting actors are many but few stand out like Danny Huston who plays friend Sandy Woodrow, a man Justin thought he knew, but will soon know better than he thought.  Very well thought out thriller that keeps you guessing and keeps you thinking through to the end.  My only regret is that Fiennes acting seemed slightly forced at times.  There is one scene though, towards the end when he's staring through a window and crying remembering his wife and that scene I felt really captured the essence of the loss his character was facing.  Weisz was amazing as was Huston...great thills and great story addressing a global problem thats slipping right under our noses.  4 1/2 stars for me...well worth a watch.
1573226521|5.0|a great book, alex garland makes you feel like your on the beach yourself.  i reccomend this book for everyone.
B000062XGD|5.0|Whats so great about this film is that one actor can carry the whole thing on his shoulders and make you give a damn.  Hanks is a wonderfully talented actor who proves that here with what I believe to be his finest performance to date.  As Fed-X employee Chuck, Hanks is stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash and is left to fend for himself woth no one to keep him company but a ball named Wilson for four years.  Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive.  Hanks proves that he is one of our generations finest leading men and this film goes down as one of my favorites for that very reason.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can honestly say that I have never been as thoroughly entertained by a TV show- or a movie, for that matter- as I have been with \\"Firefly.\\"  I caught \\"Serenity\\" in the theatres on a whim after seeing the great reviews.  After borrowing the tragically short complete series DVD's from my brother, I am hooked.    You just can't beat the writing, acting, and pure-entertainment this show offers.  It is so original and full of heart and humor.    It would be a genius move of any network to resurrect this show, as I am positive through my personal experience and just a bit of Internet browsing that the Firefly fanbase has exploded in numbers since the movie and DVD releases.
1573223026|1.0|This audiobook was entertaining, and was made more interesting by the different voices on the audio book. It was slightly insightful but more funny than provocative. I rate this book one out of five stars because of the horrible language. Expect to hear the \\"F\\" word multiple times every minute. It was such overkill that it really took away from the book. While I understand the concept of having the different characters speak in their own words to show their personalities - three out of the four characters used this word non stop throughout the entire audiobook. Isn't that a bit much? Also expect a fair amount of Bush bashing. The author got his digs in several times about how The President is stupid, war monger, etc. I'm glad the author isn't in the President's position on the war on terror.....I suppose he'd use the F word to retaliate against the terrorists :) <br />
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|The thing that bothers me about this group is that some of the guys in the group have some decent talent, but you put them all together on a cd and wow, give me a barf bag.  Anyone who thinks their music is funny, fun, or entertaining, seriously needs their head checked.  The sad thing is all they have to do to sell a million records is make a stupid video with Eminem in it, people are that simple minded, they would buy a terd in a box if eminem put his name on it.  Anyways, enough of my ranting, just be sure to avoid this cd like the plague.<br /><br />The Zapper
B00000DGXN|5.0|Wow! What superlatives can you muster to adequately describe a collaboration of these five jazz giants? I'll spare you the hyperbole and just say that this is a mandatory acquisition for any semi-serious modern jazz fan. No if's, and's or but's. Burton, Metheny, and Corea all contribute new compositions as well as some of their own standards. The inclusion of Metheny's Question and Answer is reason enough buy this CD on the spot.    Although my rating says 5 stars, it is actually 4 3/4 stars because of a couple niggles I do feel like mentioning. Over the years I have not developed as much of an affinity for Corea's music as I have Burton's or Metheny's because he seems to treat the piano as a percussive instrument as much as he does a tonal instrument - which is not necessarily a good thing as far as my listening pleasure is concerned. His style is fraught with rapid fire, staccato arpeggiation and chromatic phrasing that often requires more effort to assimilate than I'd like to exert. And this album is no exception.    This issue is then exacerbated by the fact that the guy who was responsible for the mixing, James Farber, managed to produce the worst piano sound I have ever heard on a recording. Chick's sound is so compressed, flat, and lifeless here that it seems like Farber was intentionally trying to fabricate what a piano would sound like under water. It's mind boggling. Again, maybe this was intentional for some artistic reason that is way over my head but it is totally lost on my meager musical sensibilities.    Even with this notable flaw, though, the rest of the body of work here is so overwhelming that it gets swept away into the greatness of what is sure to become a modern day classic by these five jazz \\"titans\\". For those reviewers who don't care for the \\"jam session format\\" on display here, welcome to jazz. Buy it right now.
B000BHHVPO|1.0|I have not purchased this set of DVDs. One reason is Im only interested in about 20 to 25% of it.  I dont know that many will argue that the best show of all(London) you cannot buy on its own...I dont want 4 discs of of which only basically 1 I will watch.  I dont listen to or watch MTV and Im not interested in over half of the other bands....I DO HOWEVER WANT THE COMPLETE LONDON SHOW and thats it!  You would think that would be simple and they would sell even more copies.  Id be willing to pay good money just for the London show.  Until then I guess I can live without this set!  Im not gonna jumble through 4 discs to hear the bands I want to hear.
B000005JA8|5.0|I wonder what the people who trash this record would think of Cecil Taylor or Albert Ayler... If youre used to free-jazz or other forms of more \\"out\\" music, this record isn't inaccessible at all. IMO, it's one of the few rock albums that can be mentioned along with other works of genius like Eric Dolphys \\"Out to lunch\\" or Cecil Taylors \\"Conquistador\\". But I prefer the follow-up \\"Lick my decals off, baby\\" which, IMO, is the best avant-garde rock album ever... And to all those people who claim that they are just making noises, use the balance knob on your stereo and you will easily hear that they are playing repeating riffs (yes, riffs!!!), this record is NOT improvised but highly composed. If you still don't like it that's ok but don't say that it's just noise or that a 4 year old could have made it, that's just flat-out ignorant...
B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent is no big shakes as a rapper, but as a lyricist he's a disaster. He can't do metaphors - at one juncture he claims to have the dancefloor \\"hot as a tea kettle\\" - and his idea of humour involves referring to fellatio as \\"licking the lollipop\\". He can't even insult people properly. There's nothing except a string of cliches so limited that repetition is unavoidable, as evidenced by the opening trio of tracks. In My Hood, on which he threatens to beat someone's girlfriend up, is followed by This Is 50, on which he boasts about his arsenal of \\"clips\\" and \\"hollow tips\\"; this precedes I'm Supposed to Die Tonight, on which he throws caution to the wind and threatens to beat someone's girlfriend up, then boasts about his arsenal of \\"clips\\" and \\"hollow tips\\". <br /> <br />The Massacre sounds like the work of someone for whom music is merely a sideline, a distraction from the serious business of perpetuating a violent, ghoulish side-show. Depressingly, you suspect 50 Cent knows exactly what his audience wants.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is the GREATEST thrash/speed metal album of all time. It kicks the living s**t out of Master of Puppets. If you want fast, angry music, before anything else. It's has some of this angriest, and sickest lyrics ever, well the sickest lyrics ever would have to go to either Carcass or Cannibal Corpse. Bottom line it kicks major ass. If you like this album get South of Heaven and Hell Awaits too, you won't be dissapointed unless you're like my dad.

B000002I4S|5.0|It is rare to find an album that can be enjoyed equally under any mood or at any time of day.  \\"Giant Steps\\" is just that.  Each of the seven compositions are bold, daring, exciting, and yet still retain a sense of accessibility.  This is the most well-rounded Coltrane record that I have heard thus far; each song is extremely well-placed, both in sequential and harmonic/melodic order.  It is perfect for the Coltrane novice who is seeking something that packs more of his signature punch than earlier efforts such as \\"Soultrane\\", but with less full-fledged abstraction found on later records such as \\"Mediatations\\".  To an experienced Coltrane listener, this album is grammar school, and I mean that not in the elitist sense, but rather that this record is probably the one that got them into 'Trane in the first place. <br /> <br />The album begins as though the producer has caught the band in a hurried state, just as they're about to begin a tune.  The title track has become somewhat of a standard over the years, though most cover outfits would hesitate to take too many liberties with it.  \\"Giant Steps\\" is a crash course in the tuneful yet thought-provoking melodic and harmonic structures that Coltrane utilizes throughout the rest of the album, not only in his magnificent soloing, but in the support structures of the piano and bass as well.  \\"Cousin Mary\\" keeps the energy going strong with a powerful bluesy progression at its core, while giving the brilliant rhythm section a chance to shine during Coltrane's reprieves.  \\"Countdown\\" is a truly one-of-a-kind piece.  Starting with its signature drum solo and Coltrane's spirited wailing soon thereafter, the piece's structure is truly indicative of its name.  When Coltrane enters guns blazing, the listener has very little idea what exactly is going on as far as tonic is concerned.  Then the piano enters with staccato chords, and the harmonic base is subtly, but not entirely, introduced.  When Coltrane enters the last push, thesignature \\"melody\\" of the song, Paul Chambers explodes with energy, and the bassline of the song is heard for the first time.  By this point the listener is immersed in the song at its fullest, and Coltrane knows this.  After only a phrase, the song screeches to a halt with one of the gentlest, most lyrical endings ever committed to tape.  It only makes sense he would follow such an exhausting number with the still upbeat yet soothing \\"Spiral\\", containing some very dark, moody, and slightly restrained soloing from Coltrane.  He brings the funk back with \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\", a slightly mischievious piece that would perfectly accompany any bank heist (don't read into that, I just have a strange imagination).   <br /> <br />If Coltrane comes at you from all sides with his so-called \\"sheets of sound\\" throughout the record, he certainly tucks you under them for the powerfully beautiful \\"Naima\\", supposedly named for his wife at the time.  This is one of the finest jazz ballads ever written.  Coltrane uses his honest (some have called it harsh?) tone to convey musical feeling even a road-hardened killer couldn't shy away from.  There is also a slight personnel change, with the delightfully hushed Jimmy Cobb replacing Art Taylor on the drums, and Wynton Kelly taking Flanagan's place on Piano.  The end of the song is truly a marvel, despite any hard feelings the listener might have over such a beautiful achievement coming to a close.  I have on several occasions found myself rewinding the disc just to hear that last batch of soft, comforting notes.  Right before you pass on into the land of dreams, Coltrane rouses you back to life with the bucket of ice water that is \\"Mr. P.C.\\".  As the name suggests, this is designed as a showcase for the marvelous Paul Chambers, just as \\"Giant Steps\\" was named after his enormous harmonic leaps in that song.  Coltrane is clearly very fond of Chambers' playing, and they work off of each other brilliantly.  After trading fours with the furious and kinetic Art Taylor, the group brings the song, and the album, to a close.   <br /> <br />If you're new to Coltrane, there is simply no better place to start.  This is assuming, however, that you've got a knack for jazz.  Otherwise, some \\"Blue Train\\" (another excellent, yet more accesible album) may be in order.  If \\"A Love Supreme\\" is his conceptual masterpiece, \\"Giant Steps\\" is surely his finest batch of songs.  This is somewhat of a technical album, and it will surely be more readily adored by musicians than non-musicians.  After listening to this record front to back, I often get so carried away by the pervasive, torrential energy of the playing that I have to expel my own excitement on my drumkit.  When listening to Coltrane, you've got to understand what you're getting into; it is easier to let his notes cascade over you rather than try to fit him in a preconceived melodic box.  He comes at you from all sides, often using long streams of notes simply for their textural effect, and saving quieter, more lyrical passages for just the right times.  Still, even non-musicians will find plenty here to enjoy, if only they afford this album the time of day.  It deserves and rewards repeated listenings, preferably through good headphones, before the glorious nuances of each of the band members become apparent.  This is simply one of the greatest records of all time, and belongs in the collection of anyone who calls themself a jazz, or even music, fan.
B0007XT87G|5.0|How one progressive rock group can continue to release music that delights me each time is beyond me.  This group makes it seem so effortless, like rolling over in bed.  Then we have to describe each work of art for the next person following, always just a little short of being able to embody the artist vision with words; once more into the breaches, my friends.<br /><br />The title song is a twisting and winding thing the moves in and out and runs ahead and falls behind, makes me want to lose my mind, but it is too late, my mind is already lost.  This song is less bizarre and psychedelic than some of the Tree's other work, but it has a lot of change ups in speed and style, which make the song challenging to hear.  I do hear some Tool-sounding moments, but I also catch some 70s King Crimson flavors that are intriguing and interest; a spice to this wonderful progressive stew.<br /><br />The following song is a Ford F-150 in comparison to the sports car sound of the first song.  \\"Shallow\\" minimizes synthesizers in favor of heavy guitar tracks and a hard-driving rock sound.  However, there is an interesting keyboard inserted in the midst of the guitars to remind everyone that it may look heavy and sound heavy, but it is still the Tree.<br /><br />The next song is poetically awesome, with wonderful music to match.  I could listen to music like \\"Lazarus\\" forever, with a little water and food to keep me going to a blissful end.  This song is wonderful, and I know I do not understand the lyrics.  The music draws me in and makes me feel melancholy and longing for something and a fear of ethereal beings and times that lie beyond the veil of what I see and feel.  Truly, \\"...moonlight is bleeding from out of...\\" my soul.<br /><br />It is time for a changeup (\\"Halo\\").  Let the music churn you; grind and grate and wake you up!  \\"Halo.\\"  The numerous little complex touches in this song just scream that this is anti-Britney Spears music.  Give me more!  Give me more!  \\"Halo.\\"<br /><br />Then follows the song that everyone in the progressive world, or the Porcupine Tree world, or both, has been talking about, \\"Somewhere But Not Here.\\"  The lyrics on this wonderful song are surreal.  The music varies from ethereal and contemplative to expositive, with the feeling that just around the corner is a great revelation ready to be revealed.  This song is one of the best on this CD, and is also one of the Tree's best songs.  Similar to the song \\"Gravity Eyelids,\\" this song really explodes about halfway through, switching between a hard rock sound and progressive rock sound, until the song switches back to a slower, more cerebral interlude that includes a wonderful acoustic guitar.  The song wraps up with two minutes of speedy music, as though the group was trying to slip in a few more musical points as the song was trying to end itself.  This song consists of wonderfully imaginative music.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the mellotron, back to Moody Blues' heyday, and \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" took very little to be one of my personal favorites from this CD.  The song is introspective in Porcupine Tree's most charming and endearing way.  The vocals are poignant and pull you into the singer's melancholy.  The song does have a brief moment of exuberance at the beginning of the last third of the song before settling back for a quiet close.<br /><br />Back into some pound rock is \\"Open Car.\\"  The lyrics remind me of the Cars, but the music is crunchy and solid until the wonderful harmony just before the soaring refrain, which I love.  Crank the stereo up really loud in preparation for the refrain, just watch the subwoofer.  The song finishes with a nice acoustic guitar and quiet harmonies; a lament for a love that we knew was transitory even as it came to fruition.  This song, the shortest on this CD, is a nice little tidbit to keep a listener from being bored.<br /><br />\\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" is another of those songs that make me long for a life where I can just lay back and listen to music.  This song has variety of sound.  There are ethereal portions that are solidly progressive; there are fast and hard portions that would feel at home in a mosh pit; there are jazz influenced portions that appear out of nowhere; and, as always, there are those vocals that make me wish I knew how to sing.  Throughout this song counterpoint abounds, beginning with the drums that punctuate out of pace with the vocals and the backing music; another winning song in the Tree repertoire.<br /><br />Porcupine Tree has a very solid and unique sound, but if ever there was a powerful influence, this song contains it, sounding similar to Pink Floyd.  The music and the vocals are thoughtful and tender, caressing your brain with the fingers of mellow music.  I saw someone say that this song was formulaic.  So be it.  This is a formula that I can listen to again and again, and never grow tired of it.<br /><br />This version of this CD ends with a remake (remix?) of \\"Shesmovedon,\\" a song which has some of the most mainstream moments that Porcupine Tree has ever recorded.  However, make no mistake, this song is a good PT song, and is a worthy addition to this album.<br /><br />I have seen others describe this album as \\"In Absentia II.\\"  It is not.  Porcupine Tree is the same group, and there are identifiable aspects to the group's sound, but this album is as different from \\"In Absentia\\" as it was from PT's other music.

But stretching an overnight jail stay into 90 days is not a memory error, it's a lie. <br />Oprah says she continues to stand behind her choice because the book's message of redemption still resonates with her. But every redemption scheme, every 12-step program I've seen includes a prerequisite of honesty with one's self and with others.

B0001US8EO|5.0|Kevin Costner richly deserves every raspberry and golden turkey he's earned, and probably deserves every respberry and golden turkey ever grown, raised, bred, or made.  But in 1994, against all odds, the oddest actor in America made a masterpiece. <br /> <br />The first hour of Wyatt Earp is insufferably Kevin.  Almost every false Costner quirk that we know and loathe from almost endless repitition is on display.  Then magic starts to happen.  The dirty gritty magnificent grandeur of the West pulls even the constricted star of this movie into an approximation of greatness.  For perhaps the first time in his life, and certainly for the first time in my experience, Costner fills a role without making it ridiculous.  Before it's over, Costner's Wyatt Earp is the West, at least the longed for West of my imagination.  Coster stares out a backlit window into the night, rain coming down, and says \\"Kill 'em all.\\"  It's yesterday -- 1881 -- once more. <br /> <br />Most reviewers resent the amorphous sprawl of this movie, but life's like that, amorphous and sprawling and without tidy transitions.  The movie gets the rampant manic energy of creative destruction that filled those years (at least in my imagination) after the war and before the Gilded Age and during the second or third of America's great depressions.  And it gets the \\"accepted\\" record right, too, the things and places that (we believe) filled the days of the brothers, their wives and laudanum whores, their rowdy consumptive friends. <br /> <br />It also gets & gives magic moments I've seen in no other film and probably can't describe.  It's after the war; lawyer Earp & his family head west.  There's a western town square, seen from above, the camera looking down perhaps from a two-story false front at a tough stringy old man who looks up at the camera as if he sees the strange glint of something from another century.  It's as if we've wormholed back to 1867 and have caught a piece of time. <br /> <br />Later, a fistfighter walks past the camera and out of the frame as if the camera was an unseen intruder transported from another time and place.    <br /> <br />This film has mythic power that approaches mystic power.  It's a magnificent film.  It's a magnificent genre.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. I was not a fan of Johnny Cash simply because I did not know anything about him and had not been exposed to his music.  When I was little I always thought he was some dry and boring country singer.  Well I was wrong!  I am so glad they brought his story to the screen.  This was a well acted and directed movie and I would highly recommend that people go and take a look so they can enjoy seeing this movie win on Oscar night.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I had originally purchased the CD after hearing their first single \\"Attack\\" when I was in Maryland on a vacation. This CD is WORTH EVERY PENNY AND THEN SOME! Hear it once, you'll be hooked, so hooked that you'll end up listening to it months after you buy it! Also, see them live, their live set is PHENOMINAL! They add their touch to performing, and you'll enjoy it!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive can best be classified as a mystery.  The ending of the movie, which forces the viewer to abandon the idea that the plot is a traditional mystery story, allows one to realize that the mystery runs still deeper--that we must look beneath the surface of events instead of taking them at face value.  It is simply a great mystery film.  The scenes, as well, are routinely well done--never superfluous.  Two men uncover a nightmarish secret behind Winkies in a suspensful scene; the director Adam Kesher meets up with a mysterious man named simply \\"The Cowboy\\", who delivers chilling dialogue.  On top of that, the film is filled with humor.  The mobster with a hatred for bad espresso is particularly hilarious.  And only David Lynch could make a gruesome triple homicide by an inept hitman so funny.  The acting is also very good.  Naomi Watts' performance is wonderful.<br /><br />Part of the joy of watching this movie is figuring out what happened.  The thrill of finally piecing together all the characters and events, and finally understanding how they all fit together, is one of the main things that makes Mulholland Drive so enjoyable to watch over and over.  It is the type of movie that needs to be seen more than once to be appreciated, along the lines of movies like Memento.<br /><br />With that said, I must warn the reader that I will be giving away vital clues and interpretations of the movie in the following review.  Do not read further if you have not seen the movie.  See the movie, come up with your own conclusions, and then read the reviews, looking for stuff you missed.  That is truly the best way to watch the film, and to spoil the interpretation is to spoil the main draw of the movie.<br /><br />Now, what happens in Mulholland Drive is that Diane Selwyn is having a dream prior to killing herself.  In reality, she has had a short affair with Camilla, and she becomes embittered when Camilla gets a high profile role in Adam Kesher's movie and subsequently falls in love with him.  She feels inadequate as an actress, and the viewer can sense her anguish as she watches Camilla and Adam announce their upcoming marriage.  Angry and depressed, Diane hires a hitman to kill Camilla.  He kills her, and Diane suddenly feels overwhelmed with guilt.  She eventually commits suicide after waking from a dream in which she had attempted to hide her guilt and her flaws, only to have the dream collapse in a realization that it is in fact a dream, a misrepresentation, and that the reality is all-too terrible.<br /><br />All these events, which are the reality, occur in short flashes of scenes at the end of the movie.  The sustained narrative at the beginning is actually Diane's dream.  The dream is Diane's attempt to rationalize her inadequacies and flaws, to forget her mistakes, and which ultimately gives voice to her regret and guilt.<br /><br />Diane becomes Betty.  Camilla becomes \\"Rita\\".  And in the dream Camilla and Diane are reunited as Betty and Rita.<br /><br />Everything is different in the dream.  The hitman never manages to assassinate Rita (Camilla).  Rita falls in love with Betty, even needs her, unlike in reality.  Adam Kesher, a brash, young director who stole Camilla away in reality, becomes subject to all kinds of tortures--the mob casts his movie for him, his wife cheats on him with the pool boy, and he loses all his money.  Betty, an idealized version of Diane, is naturally a great actress.  In reality, Diane can only get secondary roles.  A further rationalization of her acting flaws is given in the idea that the mob controls the movie production--the selection of the actress is not based on talent, but a threat of violence.<br /><br />The whole idea of acting is also foreshadowing the fact that everything is a dream...nothing is real.  The whole beginning narrative is only an act, a dream; it is not reality.<br /><br />Now, David Lynch doesn't spell out this interpretation in big, bold letters.  The viewer hasto figure out that the main narrative is a dream on his or her own.  But there is much foreshadowing.  Following the opening scene depicting the jitterbug contest, we see the camera switch over to the first person perspective of someone breathing heavily and lying down to bed.  The word \\"dream\\" is mentioned constantly throughout the film.  Betty is living in the \\"city of dreams\\".  The two men in Winkie's are brought there by a \\"dream\\" of something terrible there.  The irony, of course, is that the men are the \\"dream\\" and the \\"reality\\" was the nightmare.  Diane hires the hitman at Winkies.  When the man finds a terrible, nightmarish homeless man behind the building, he is coming face to face with reality--with Diane's inner guilt.  The most obvious clue that all was a dream, however, is the fact that Diane is shown waking up after the opening of the blue box.<br /><br />The scene at club Silencio is also full of symbolism and foreshadowing.  All is an illusion there.  Everyone is acting, lip-synching to a recording.  It is here that Betty finds the box that Rita's key can unlock--the box that, when opened, reveals the truth and unravels the dream.  The spectacle they witness at the club, of the woman collapsing whilst her voice continues singing its terrible song, causes the dream to lose its consistency...the dreamer begins to realize that it is indeed a dream, an illusion.<br /><br />Rita is obviously supposed to represent Camilla.  But as the dream progresses, Rita more and more comes to represent Diane.  Rita symbolizes Diane's inability to know herself...she has amnesia, has no idea who she really is--just as Betty has no idea who she really is, that she is just an act, a fake misrepresentation of Diane.  When Betty and Rita fall in love, it at first represents Diane's wish to have Camilla love her...but eventually it symbolizes Diane's wish to love herself, to forgive herself for what she has done, to accept her flaws and inadequacies.  This is why, as the movie progresses, Rita dons a blonde wig, like Diane and Betty.  This is why, at the opening of the box, it is Rita who opens it, while Betty disappears.  Betty is no longer needed; she is seen to be a false representation...the dreamer is too close to realizing the dream isn't reality, that all is illusion.  It is Rita who doesn't know who she is, just as it is Diane who doesn't realize she is not actually Betty.  And then the box opens, and all is clear.  Rita is Diane...Betty is merely an idealized figment of the imagination.<br /><br />All of the scenes only add to these themes.  They are either manifestations of Diane's need to idealize herself, to explain her inadequacies--or they are manifestations of Diane's inner turmoil, her guilt and her fears.<br /><br />We have all desired to rationalize our faults, to see ourselves as good, to forgive our own mistakes.  Diane's emotions are universal, and the depiction of her descent into suicide, of her regret and her fears, magnified extraordinarily once the viewer figures out all the subtle aspects of the dream, is absolutely heart-rending.<br /><br />Mulholland Drive is a great film, and I'd recommend it to anyone willing to sit and think about a film, to tackle an unconventional mystery whose solution is wonderfully satisfying.wn.

B000002J29|5.0|Wow! This was my first ever Genesis album. I bought this and \\"And then there were Three\\" on the same day in 1978. From here I went \\"back in time\\" in regards to the Genesis catalogue whilst eagerly awaiting each next Genesis release (2 years later being the masterpiece known as \\"Duke\\" in 1980).    There is passion, power, superb musicianship and so much emotion throughout this album. Here is a live album from a band fronted by their drummer who appears driven to show they \\"still had it\\" after Peter Gabriel's departure. I really take my hat off to Phil Collins. At this time (1976/1977) Phil was not the \\"success\\" (commercially speaking) of the mid 80's thru to the 90's). In the mid 70's he stepped out from behind the Genesis drumkit  and took on the lead vocal duties and \\"front man\\" role from Peter Gabriel. The passion, drive and determination to succeed just pushes this live album to a classic status. There is hunger and a sense of desperation and emotion that Phil shows vocally throughout the album that needs to be heard to be believed (particularly on \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Musical Box - closing Section\\" and \\"Suppers Ready\\" (to me the definitive version, it is absolutely stunning).   Combine that hunger and the superb musicianship of the band (Tony Banks - Keyboards, Steve Hackett - Guitar) and Mike Rutherford - Bass and Guitar) and you have what to me is one of the greatest Live albums ever. The whole band seems intent on giving the performances of their lives, to move on and succeed after Peter's departure.     Last but not least, the drums. With Phil picking up the Lead Vocal and front man duties a live drummer was required. Initially Bill Bruford (ex Yes / King Crimson) was in the hot seat and plays on \\"Cinema Show\\" on this album. The rest of the tracks feature the new incumbent at the time - Chester Thompson (ex Frank Zappa / Weather Report). Chester went on to remain touring with the band for the next 15 years and its little wonder why. Given the very short time he'd been with the band he gives a stunning display. Chester provides a strong backbone to the songs, and gives the music a certain rhythm and \\"swing\\". The live versions of these songs really benefit from Chester's work, they just feel so alive and energetic, he really plays as though his life depends on it, and he gives 110%! Throughout the album Chester's work  is superb and is simply outstanding on \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\", \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Firth of Fifth\\", Musical Box - closing Section\\", \\"Suppers Ready\\" (especially the \\"Apocalypse 9/8\\" section with Phil - stunning!, \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" (including Drum Duel with Phil) and \\"Los Endos\\".  Chester has a certain style and sound and he absolutely rocks).     So, in summary, a fantastic live album and one of my favorite live albums of all time. The band is in absolutely top form. There's something special about this album, an \\"x\\" factor that pushes this album over the top and into classic status. It appears to be almost a hint of \\"desperation\\" that comes thru form two of the band members... Phil stepping into Peter Gabriel's shoes as front man and lead vocals and Chester stepping into Phil's shoes to provide the backbone and rhythm and adding a \\"swing\\" to the Genesis sound that moved them to another dimension live.     I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have over the years, it is so uplifting and musically stunning to listen to - a real classic.    Certainly one of my favourite live albums over the last 35 years (here are some of my other favourites)...     - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)- \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006)
0307276902|1.0|Zero stars. I cannot believe Oprah supported this book filled with lies and fabrications.  <br /> <br />I want my money back Oprah. I believed you but you are a liar.
0805047905|5.0|When our son was into learning colors, this was one of his favorite bedtime stories. We read it so many times, he memorized the final page where they list off all of the colors and animals. Repeating \\"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?\\" every time can get a bit repetitive (especially when your son just wants to turn to the next page), but it is integral to tying the structure together. While I call it repetitive, we still love the book.<br /><br />It's been almost 2 years since the hey-day of this book, but sometimes he'll find it in his book can and pull it out for a reading. And then we reimmerse ourselves in the funky colors and illustrations and figure out what the brown bear really saw.
B000C4SHRW|4.0|I have to agree with other reviewers that _Abhorsen_ feels more like it should've been part of the last book instead of by itself. It does have that \\"chapter\\" feel to it, but being able to go directly from the last book to this one helps to alleviate some of the problem. I imagine it was much worse if you had to wait a year for the conclusion. There are still plenty of point of view problems and indeed, Nix seems to have fallen in love with descriptive prose near the end. It becomes very difficult to visualize everything that's happening. <br /> <br />But none of that makes this a bad book. It makes it less than exceptional, true, but it's still a very good read and a decent wrap up of the whole story arc. <br /> <br />Lirael may have discovered who she's meant to be, but Sam still has a ways to go and it takes him until the end to even come close. So many questions are finally answered about Mogget and suspicions confirmed about the Dog.  <br /> <br />I really liked the ending. It pointed out that while the Big Evil may have been conquered, these people still had lives to sort out and they'd need help doing it. They're still people, ones with all sorts of emotional and physical scars from this war; it made me care about them even more, and even regret that this was the last I'd be seeing of them. At least there was some prediction about their future though, a way to see that they'd be all right, given time, and the very end itself was more than enough to make me smile. It really was a great way to close out the book. <br /> <br />I'll definitely be recommending this series.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Holy blanking blank!  How on earth did this escape my attention for so many years?  This release more than lives up to all of the hype you read in the accompanying reviews.  There aren't adequate words to describe this find.  I'll try.  Clapton's playing on this release is every bit as important and Charlie Parker's Cherokee, which ushered in the era of bebop.  It is to the guitar as Coltrane's Giant Steps was to the tenor sax.  Clapton is truly revolutionary in this session!<br /><br />This Mayall release finds Clapton sandwiched between The Yardbirds and Cream.  I always like Cream but really never understood the EXTREME Eric Clapton hype.  I thought he was a very good guitar player but there were others who sounded as good to me.  Now I get it. I really do get it!  Now I can see why others were just so blown away during this period of Clapton's career (circa 66), including one guitar player then known as Jimmy James (Jimi Hendrix).<br />From this point onward, literally EVERYTHING about rock and blues guitar changed forever.  The master tapes should be enshrined somewhere!  I don't go in for the \\"God\\" label or any of that \\"best guitarist in the world\\" yadda yadda yadda crap, but this is truly amazing music even by today's standards.<br /><br />If you like great electric blues your are going to love this, especially if you are a guitar player.  I can't stop playing Hideaway - wow!  I can't believe this was 1966 - the remaster  makes this session sound fresh - like it was recorded earlier this morning - it's THAT GOOD!  Click now and when you receive this little goody, pop it in your player and crank up the volume!
B0009I7NNA|2.0|\\"Bat Country\\" just loads it all on but is ultimately empty . . . I like music that ranges from the heaviest Death (try HUMAN) to the mellowist ambient but the music still has to be good and I just don't hear any great songs on this album.<br /><br />These guys brag about how they want unlimited access to $, drugs and trim. At least they're honest, but I can't say that I'm impressed.<br /><br />At least their tattoos are cool. \\"Gee, I'm a loser, but if I get a tattoo, THEN I'll be cool! . . .  The more tattoos I get, the cooler I'll be!!!\\" ---------- LOOO-SERS!
0307276902|1.0|[...]    When Oprah asked why he lied, Frey really didn't have a very valid excuse, he just said that the lies were a \\"coping mechanism\\" that helped him feel \\"badder/tougher than I really am.\\" Throughout the entire interview, Frey continued to hem and haw with each of Oprah's questions. It was blatantly obvious that he was STILL lying. As he stuttered and the audience laughed, it was obvious we were watching a pathological liar.    All in all, some readers will feel the end justifies the means, and that Frey's duplicity is acceptable as long as his book encourages people to feel better about themselves.    I'm not one of those readers. When I'm lied to, I feel like that person hasn't given me the benefit of the doubt to judge the truth on its level. Therefore, I think of James Frey as a duplicitous, manipulative scumbag who doesn't deserve any of the money he has received and definitely none of the accolades.    Hopefully, there is a special little place reserved in the afterlife for our Mr. Frey.
B00004BZ16|4.0|This was originally released as a triple album.  That was almost unheard of back in 1980, where the only triple albums you usually saw were live ones, or ones by Frank Zappa.  This was a triple album of new material, and for the most part, it's excellent.  I used to tell people this was my favorite Clash album, but it's now my second (predictably, London Calling is).  But this one has around 3 sides of excellent material, one side of good material, one side of average stuff, and one side of s*** (most of which is in the last 6 songs).  Just a few favorites...The Magnificent Seven, The Leader, Rebel Waltz, The Sound of the Sinners, Lose this Skin, Police on My Back, Version City.  There are some drawbacks, though.  There are some songs that should have been tossed in the incinerator (like One More Dub, Lightning Strikes, If Music Could Talk, Junco Partner), and the last five songs of the album.  3 of these (Living in Fame, Silicone on Saphirre, and Version Pardner) are all remixes of earlier songs (and vastly inferior).  Career Opportunities is a remake of an early Clash song, and Sheperd's Delight is an instrumental that sounds like it just got thrown together.  Is this worth picking up?  Sure, there's enough great material here for that.  There's a lot of filler, though.  But The Clash does get points for ambition.  I miss that kind of ambition these days...
B000062YAZ|1.0|Look, I love all kinds of hard-edged, guitar-driven musik, with great harmonies and intelligent lyrics.  Some bands however take things a bit too far.  Well, one day I was at the movie theater and I was getting hungry so I ran out to the lobby to get a snack.  I saw this funny looking fat guy with long greasy hair squirting butter on his extra-large popcorn and he had on this scary looking shirt.  I asked him just who the hekk it was, he said \\"dude, its Slaer, there best albumn is Reign In Blood and you should check it out\\", so check it out I did.  Wow, what a mistake, this is not hat good guitar musik should be at all.  First off, all the musik is fast, I don't see any talent in playing musik fast, any jerk can do that!!  There are no memorable guitar parts, the singer just screams, and the lyrics are violent, satanic and gross!!  I hate this!!  I don't see whats so great about Kerry King's guitar riffs or Dave Lombardo's drumbing...its all one big mess!!  For good guitar musik stick with Green Day, Linkin Park, KoRn, Hawthorne Heights, Taking back Sunday, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Papa Roach, Yellowcard, Atreyu, Death Cab For Cutie, Slipknot, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte and Reliant K!!  Slayer is junk and they need to retire!!  Go Bengals!!  Who-Dey!!
0790731940|2.0|I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual \\"pap\\" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.  <br /> <br />Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie. <br /> <br />This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Munich was one of 2005's best movies because it's ultimate message, for those who actually pay attention, was one of understanding.<br /><br />Munich is not anti-Semitic or anti-Islamic it is only anti-stupidity.  The repetitive and non-productive cycle of revenge that is present in all of society is the enemy that Speilberg sought to expose.<br /><br />Acknowledgement is made that both the Islamic extremists who perpetrated the terrorist plot at the Munich games and the Israeli assassin squad ordered to kill them are all products of the environment that reared them.<br /><br />This movie is often hard to watch and it spotlights the idiocy of issues like blind patriotism, murder, and religious zeal, when those issues are not counterbalanced with reason and intelligence.<br /><br />While I think Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are both better movies I believe Spielberg took greater risk by investing a heckuva lot of his personal beliefs into this film.  Obviously controversy would emerge with any film dealing with this subject matter, the fact that no sides are overtly taken is a true testament to Speilberg's genius.<br /><br />The only advocacy clearly nurtured in this film is for a worldwide push for peace, to set aside the differences that are more traditional than tangible, for nations to adhere to reason in diplomacy, rather than naked emotion.<br /><br />If you really want to know what Munich is ultimately about you'll have to wait until the very last shot in the film.  In the background there are two buildings that are no longer there.<br /><br />All things considered Munich is gutsy filmmaking by a filmmaker who certainly doesn't need to take risks, the result is heartbreaking and thought provoking.
B00000K19E|5.0|At the time it was made, THE MATRIX was considered a cinematographic revolution. Everything about it was so novel that it changed the way action moviemakers thought about making their movies. <br />THE MATRIX is just the perfect movie. It has a great stroyline, great philosophy behind the story, and great action scenes. It is, therefore, expected to satisfy a wide range of people with different tastes.  <br />I watched this movie many years ago and I consider it to be a great catalyst of my intellectual development. It is a movie that makes you think about the nature of the world, reality, metaphysics and much more. It is a movie that makes you question almost everything in life. It does that without getting you bogged down in the details, but instead, it does it while providing a kind of kung fu that you've never seen before!
B000C65Z1G|5.0|Satisfying and scary journey into the human heart is a breathtaking look at the horrors of big business gone wild and a touching look at pure love. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give Oscar worthy performances and Fernando Meirelles gives this film such a realistic touch that is almost too freighting to witness. Of all the films I have seen this year, this is the best.  This is a film that will have you talking long after the end credits roll. <br /> <br />Five stars all the way. <br />
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Vampires have been waging a war against Werewolves for over a thousand years. This movie involves a part of the war that takes place in the 21st century streets of Budapest. <br />The movie builds the world of vampires and werewolves very well. It shows both the \\"beast\\" and the human sides of these creatures (the thing that makes it most fascinating I think), so that one can relate to them more as \\"real\\" characters. It is quite nice how the movie shows some science behind vampire and werewolves; a far stretch but still a good try. <br />This movie is hard-paced so there is never a dull moment. It is one of those movies that really engages you and allows you into its world. It could very well become a classic. <br />
B000003H3M|4.0|This is beauty in the beast..what a fantastic album!!! Testament, since Alex Skolnic left, did not sit pretty, looking into their past and thinking how they were instrumental in getting heavy metal to the masses. Instead, they got the awesome shredder, James Murphy, and released kick ass album after kick ass album, begining with Low. I was into Testament quite heavily during the Low days but later lost touch as I moved more into doom (Paradise lost, Moonspell, Novembers Doom, My Dying Bride, Amorphis etc) and melodic death (Opeth, Soilwork, In Flames, Arch Enemy etc). One of my good metal friends gave DEMONIC to me saying its quite heavy.  <br /> <br />As soon the opening track DEMONIC REFUSAL blasted in my speakers I bowed to Testament in awe and respect. I could not believe what I was hearing. Testament playing death metal and it sounds so freaking good. I love this album and also the following The Gathering. Every track is fine blend of vocal melody and heavy, no-nonsense riffing. John Doe, Demonic Refusal, The Burning Times, Together As One stand out. All fans of heavy music unite and give respect where it is due...in these days of playing weaker and weaker music in the name of progression, only bands like TESTAMENT, PANTERA and few other old schoolers like ARMORED SAINT (check out Revelation), EXODUS (check out SHOVEL HEADED KILL MACHINE)are going against the grain to keep the heavy stuff, well, heavy. I like my metal, uncompromising, brutal and melodic...if you like it that way...get DEMONIC... <br /> <br />Man, the tempo change in Together As One at 2.10 minutes is so mind-numbing...you have to check it out yourself...STRAP IT ON, OLD SCHOOL...10, 9, 8, 7, 666..way to go my heavy brothers!!!
B00009P1O2|4.0|Queen was a unique band, one of my personal favorites, and this is a great time for fans of the band to preserve some great performances on affordable dvds.  The picture quality here is excellent, the audio is good, and the 80's atmosphere is very much alive and in the air.  Freddie is the best rock singer ever, but his vocals seem a little weaker here than they did earlier in his career.  Some have attributed this to his smoking habit he began in the 80's.  However, on disc 2, watch the Friday concert excerpts and Freddie's voice and energy seem stronger, at least to me. Crazy Little Thing called Love on disc 2 is sensational Freddie at his best. I wish the entire Friday concert in the rain was available on here, because Freddie and the band were loose, relaxed and in great form on the few songs we do see from that show. Under Pressure and Love of My Life are great songs that only seem average on disc one. Queen has done better versions of these songs elsewhere. However, there are better than average versions of One Vision, Hammer To Fall, Radio Ga Ga, and We Are The Champions on disc one. I think disc one is a mixed bag in terms of Freddie's vocals, but even when he is average, he's better than anyone else. Don't look for Somebody to Love or Fat Bottomed Girls on this DVD; you won't find them.  Overall, this is well worth it for Queen fans. Disc two, in particular, is great for showcasing Freddie's personality as he struts and sings during the Friday concert.  Also found on the second disc are interesting documentaries, recent interviews with Brian and Roger, a multi-angle feature spotlighting each band member individually, and rare rehearsal footage.
B00000JLWW|4.0|I have officially joined the ranks of Those Who Have Seen Titanic.  I fought it long and hard.  Back in 1997, when it first debuted, I waged a massive campaign, sent out a horde of evil beasts and mercenaries to destroy every living human.  Oh wait, that's when I was Sauron.  Anyway...<br /><br />It had become readily apparent that this was The Chick-Flick of All-Time, as well as the highest grossing movie.  It broke attendance records that were held by Star Wars for something like twenty years.  Demographics showed that every woman in America, age 30-50, had seen this five times apiece.  (Of course, I'm only slightly exaggerating.)  I decided then and there that I would not see it.  James Cameron, the mediocre bastard who gave us Terminator II and True Lies, did not need anymore fame or money.  This whole Titanic bit had clearly gone to his head.<br /><br />So last night, I finally watched it because I could do so with the knowledge that I was not giving a damned red cent to anything related to that film.  Because I checked it out from the library.  And you know what?<br /><br />It was pretty good.<br /><br />I could have done without the modern-day beginning, narration, and ending, though I can understand why they were in there.  The acting was fantastic, the sets were beautiful, and apparently pain-stakingly accurate.  I even got teary-eyed a couple times because of the intense emotional charge.  Especially when the band stayed to play, when the couple slept on the bed as their room flooded, and most of all, when Rose blows the whistle.  That scene is so fierce, as it is the fulfillment of her promise and there's just this I-WILL-LIVE ferocity in her eyes.  It was beautiful.<br /><br />I'm very happy this movie was made.  It allowed Leo DiCaprio to not work for a long time, and gave him the freedom to choose his roles much more carefully and allowed him to only do what he wanted and, unlike a lot of actors, not take crap roles just for the paycheck.  It also gave us Kate Winslet, who has become one of my favorite actresses of all time.<br /><br />So all in all, it was good, and I'm glad I waited eight years to see it.  I wouldn't have appreciated it back in 1997.  I'm a much more empathic and emotive person now, which allows me to enjoy life and its many accoutrements with a greater depth and breadth.<br /><br />I hereby anoint this movie with a large golden violin and a lifetime supply of towels.aycheck.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|It is official. I have watched Napoleon Dynamite. I put it off as long as I could because I was afraid. Yes, afraid. I didn't want to know if I was the kind of person who likes Napoleon Dynamite.<br /><br />When this film debuted, some of my closest friends told me it was an amazing film, hilarious, and even quite possibly the best movie ever. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions.<br /><br />However, there was a contingent group who hated it. These are good friends, whose opinions I trust. They have recommended good movies to me before, and I have been content and enthralled with their suggestions. Their loathing was only matched by the previous group's love for it.<br /><br />Napoleon yin to Dynamite yang.<br /><br />The media said this. Professional movie reviewers said this. Complete strangers I harassed on the bus said this. Just kidding, I don't ride the bus. But complete strangers did come to the same conclusions about this film.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is either the best or the worst film ever made.<br /><br />Suddenly, the world is thrown into sharp contrast. There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love it and those who hate it. I didn't want to know what kind of person I was, if I was a lover or a hater. What would it say about who I am and the structure of my personality and my taste in films and comedy? Which ever would I be? Let the spinning of the Tao commence!<br /><br />I've now seen it three times. Upon the first viewing, I kept waiting for the punch line. I kept waiting to laugh. It felt like it was a constant set-up with no payoff. (However, the introductory credits were clever and exciting.) It left me feeling blah.<br /><br />Upon the second viewing, for some reason, I started to giggle more. I paid more attention to the details. I submitted myself to that world. Napoleon's whiny GHAWD seemed less grating. Pedro was suddenly hilarious. And damn, I want that suit.<br /><br />By the third viewing, I think I figured it out. It's not a constant set up and no punch lines. It's all punch line. That's why it's one of the most quoted movies right now. Every phrase is a one-liner with a subtle punch. I bet the French love that movie. The background, the sets and clothes, the top-loading VCRs, the god-almighty moon boots, the ambiance is the set up for this film. At first I balked over the seeming lack of plot, but the more I've seen it, the less it matters. The wedding is the best part. \\"Sorry I'm late. I just got done taming a wild honeymoon stallion for you guys.\\" Salvador Dali would be proud.<br /><br />So, what can I say, I liked it. Eventually. It grew on me like an overzealous mole. Like a chia pet. Like bacteria on a forming brick of bleu cheese. The only problem now is that I have a nine-year-old running around occasionally belting out an exasperated whine of, \\"I told you! I spent the summer with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines!\\"<br /><br />This concludes another edition of Jeremy's Movie Review.

0307276902|5.0|I read this book back in September when it was chosen for Oprah's Book of the month.  I LOVE THIS BOOK.  I've bought multiple copies and given them out.  This messege to \\"hold on\\" while very few words, and so powerful. <br /> <br />I hope that America doesn't let all the recent hype and criticizim of the book and author cloud their vision of this book.  Wether memoir or fiction, this is a story that needed to be told. <br /> <br />In defense of James Frey, the lies he did tell, in the whole scheme of things are minor.  To alter the details of characters is something all authors do, especially in memoirs or books \\"based on a true story,\\" because the identities of the real people do need to be protected.  The dentist scene, we still are unsure if it is true.  He simply doesnt remember, and has documents and people at the treatment center saying that there is a possibilty that there wasn't any novicane used, and no one who knows the \\"truth\\" has told him otherwise.  As far as lying about jail, that is the one lie that I find pointless. But still is not a big deal, whether in jail for 87 days or 2 hours, the messege of the book remains the same. <br /> <br />No one says a memoir has to be 100% true, if that was the case, it would be called a Biography.  If you look back to A Bell Jar and Girl Interupted, both Memoirs, do you really believe every single word in those books are 100% true?  I highly doubt it, but they will remain some of the greatest works in literature, and this book deserves to be amongst that group. <br /> <br />Please do read this book, as it is really really great.  If you don't want to support the author take it out of your local Library.
1594200653|5.0|I was born in 1944 in England and lived there till 1987 when I came to this country. I was astonished when I arrived in the U.S.A. with the lack of knowledge about Europe, especially the \\"we liberated them - they should be grateful\\" attitude found mainly among those who have never been to Europe.<br /><br />Judt's book has huge amounts of detail about Europe, both East and West. He has a knack of summing up trends while showing interesting facts about how Europe developed. I learned how the French Renault car company was nationalized after the war after Louis Renault's collaboration with the Nazis. Judt also shows how post World War II countries like France that were occupied during the war tried and failed to run their economies without German production, just as Germany had been a vital partner before the war. And also, Judt shows how the Korean war was the reason why Germany rose again to be a world-class industrial power.<br /><br />Much of what Judt describes I knew as an adult, and his description of England is spot-on, especially the \\"old colonial\\" past. I also suffered under the reign of Margaret Thatcher, and can confirm that admiration for her is misplaced.<br /><br />Judt also shows how the breakup of Communism in Europe and the U.S.S.R. was not because of Thatcher or Reagan, but almost completely by Gorbachev, who wasn't aware of what he had started. In turn Gorbachev was affected by Russia's Afghan war, along with the disaster at Chernobyl, into realizing that the U.S.S.R. could not run many European countries or even itself.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book is a story of how Europe eventually came to realize what happened to the Jews up to 1945. I have a friend who emigrated from the U.S.S.R. as a Jew, who had a friend who went to Germany. The guy in Germany took his non-Jewish girlfriend's last name, not because of any anti-semitic problems so much as the hugely apologetic nature of today's Germans.<br /><br />And yet you find people who are nostalgic for living under communism. A friend's son went to Berlin, where his landlady said \\"I was spied on!\\" by the East German secret police. However, she had a certain nostalgia for the old days where everyone had a job and the future appears secure.<br /><br />Judt quotes the Radio Armenia joke (popular among Russians, about a mythical radio program that can answer questions). \\"Comrades, can we foretell the future?\\" \\"Certainly, comrade, foretelling the future is no problem, it is the past that is forever changing.\\"<br /><br />Thanks goodness that we have Judt to write this book. I feel glad that it's told the story of my continent, warts and all. And maybe some of you Americans can learn a little about where I come from.who are nostalgic for living under communism.

B00080Z53O|5.0|This movie is a must! It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Yes, it touches the topic of Euthanasia, however, the movie does not influence the audience to promote it.  <br /> <br />This is a beautiful film. It is romantic, magic, the photografy is beautiful and it has its moments of sadness as well as some humor touches. <br /> <br />I have seen this movie three times and I couldn't wait to buy it. I just bought it yesterday! This Academy Award Movie in 2004 could also win the Best Actor. Javier Barden is a terrific actor.  <br /> <br />Buy and see this movie! It will be unforgettable for you, it is truly WONDERFUL!
B000C65Z1G|3.0|What The Constant Gardener is about pharmaceuticals, AIDS, tuberculosis, and Africa.  I feel that The Constant Gardener is a movie about the cover up of the pharmaceutical industry as it relates to the diseases of tuberculosis and AIDS in Africa.  The critics have said that this is also a love story.  However, I feel that it is more a story of lies and betrayal.  I don't see how it can be a love story.  When the wife is lying to her husband about what she's doing, or perhaps just neglecting to tell him what she's doing. <br /> <br />The first hour of the movie is very slow with a lot of exposition.  The second hour of the movie is better.  Once we get into the meat of the story.  That is why I am only giving this movie three starts.  I felt that this movie could have been better, if only they would have paid more attention to the editing process.

0307276902|1.0|I began reading this book before all of the recent hype.  The hype began when I was halfway through the book.  I have to say that I found the book to be over the top before I found out about the lies.  I found Frey's arrogance throughout the book to be a huge turn-off.  Had the book been touted as a fiction I might not be as strongly against it, however, I find the lies that have been revealed completely mar the book.  On top of everything else, it is the most depressing book I have read in a very long time.

B00005JOIF|2.0|In the years after the terrorist attack on Israeli team members during the 1972 Munich Olympics, Avner (Eric Bana) leads a crew of Mossad agents as they attempt to hunt down and assassinate eleven of the Palestinians allegedly responsible... This should have been wonderful: a great historical story and a master director and his usual crew to tell it. Apart from making achingly obvious points about the pointlessness of tit-for-tat retaliation between Israelis and Palestinians, the screenplay helpfully eschews most of the politics and instead makes this a human story: it's an exploration of the immense personal cost of the politics of revenge for those ordered to exact it. At least, it tries to be that. As the story of a man who comes to question the morality of politically-justified murder, it should have been incredibly moving. As it turns out, it's incredibly dull. It's too long, too sprawling, too unfocused. It felt like a rough cut with 45 minutes still to come out. The all-important interpersonal scenes are badly written, and only one or two of the action sequences are up to Spielberg's standard. Janusz Kaminski's usually wonderful cinematography aims for realism but verges on ugly and banal. John Williams' music is, for the first time ever, utterly forgettable. Also, for once in their collective career, Spielberg and Michael Kahn have made a complete mess of the editing. Lapses in continuity abound. Intercutting the events from Munich with the story-proper probably looked good on paper, but in the viewing it feels discontinuous, pointless and even a little gratuitous - never more so than when the violent climax of the terrorist raid is intercut with a sex scene, presumably as a way of showing the psychological impact of the events on Avner's relationship with his wife. Pity he never witnessed them. The horrific nature of what happened might have been more usefully deployed at the start of the film as a way of encouraging the audience to share the Israelis' outrage. The casting didn't work for me - Geoffrey Rush, especially. What is it with Oscar-winners and bit parts? Does Spielberg really need a marquee name other than his own to open a movie? Is there no Jewish actor who could've more capably played Ephraim? I found Bana quite empathetic but only intermittently convincing. Perhaps it's my inability, as an Australian, finally to divorce Eric Bana the aspiring A-list Hollywood actor from Eric Bana the A-list local stand-up comic. Or perhaps it's just that he was a little better at the latter: as a movie star, he occasionally suffers from the same kind of woodenness that afflicts Spielberg's favourite leading man, Harrison Ford. But I guess there are worse comparisons. I wanted to like this film, but ultimately found it incredibly disappointing. The inner battle between the emotional impulse for violent justice and the rational desire to break the cycle of violence is the crux of the film, but it simply doesn't sustain intellectual interest on that level. The issue is explored in a far too obvious and superficial manner for it ever to really work.age. The casting didn't work for me - Geoffrey Rush, especially.

0307276902|1.0|While Frey's book may be an exciting read, it was also touted as being 'autobiographical.' Therefore, as a drug/alcohol counselor, I was horrified to hear Frey's admission that he \\"embellished\\"....or in more honest terms, lied, about every single character and most of the incidents in his book....all the while decrying the efficacy of every 12-step program and the Higher Power at the core of them.  One of the most difficult tasks an addiction counselor has is that of breaking through a client's lies regarding their life.  As noted in an editorial in the Baltimore Sun Times, \\"The hard work of recovery depends more than anything else on confronting the truth of what we are and what we have done, trying to make amends to those we have harmed and beginning to live our lives with transparent honesty.\\" Mr. Frey's rationalization for his actions is that, because many people have been helped by his book, the embellishments don't matter.  The reaction to this justification by the addicts at my drug/alcohol treatment center speaks volumes to the contrary....they feel terribly betrayed.  One recovering addict expressed it best, \\"Lying is easy...telling the truth, so difficult.\\"  I won't enable Frey's lies, which have already made him rich, by recommending this book to anyone.
B000000WCX|5.0|... and I mean that.  I'm not gushing unjustly.  This is a perfect package from the bottom up. <br /> <br />Most of the criticisms of this album take into account that Bowie was 50 years old at the time, like techno is strictly a young person's game.  It's sad to think that, had a 20-year-old recorded EXACTLY this album, in the same time and place, I'm almost certain it would have been huge.  HUGE.  But because it was done by Bowie, people attached the weight of his age and his musical history to it, which is missing the point entirely.  Take this album on its own, as it is, without any preconceived notions or ageism or anything, and this is a real firecracker. <br /> <br />Frankly, if anything, Bowie's experience only makes the album better than what a 20-year-old could have done.  The songs are actually structured like pop-rock, with moving chord progressions, ice-water piano, live drums mixed seamlessly with programmed ones, and some of the best vocals of Bowie's career (or, for that matter, anyone's).  This is not like any other techno out there, at all.  There's literally NOTHING ELSE LIKE THIS ALBUM.  It's entirely unique.  That really makes me sad, because this album is so spectacular, I want more like it. <br /> <br />One thing I find particularly interesting about this album is that there is a subtle A-side/B-side quality.  It may not be apparent right away, because the division is not nearly as obvious as it is on Low or \\"Heroes\\", but it's there.  All the songs in the first half of the album, from \\"Little Wonder\\" through \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" are positively-charged and upbeat - with the exception of \\"Seven Years In Tibet,\\" which is venomous, a sizzling acid burn.  Then, from \\"Telling Lies\\" through \\"LAW (Earthlings On Fire)\\", the album takes a dark, ominous turn.  There's a distinct sense of foreboding and danger in this second half.  It's a very clever arrangement.  This album is so flawless, I wouldn't even change the order of tracks! <br /> <br />In iTunes, one can rate individual tracks from 0 to 5 stars.  This is the ONLY album to which I have given solid five-star ratings.  \\"Little Wonder\\" and \\"Telling Lies,\\" being perhaps the least utterly amazing tracks on the album (and ironically, also the first two singles from it), I had initially given four stars each, simply because it felt wrong to say an album is perfect.  I finally gave in and gave them five stars as well, because honestly, were I given the option to tell Bowie what to change about those tracks to make them even better, I'd tell him not to change a thing. <br /> <br />This really is a perfect album.  Whether someone new to it is going to like it or not really depends on their expectations, biases, and so on, moreso than strictly the album itself.  But if one can strip away all that baggage and just let the album stand on its own merits, I expect they'll be blown away.  To anyone who can do that, I recommend this album most highly.
0307276902|1.0|I began reading the book and its appeal was in how such a traumatic series of events propelled someone downwards only to climb back up - now that this has become largely a work of fiction or faction whatever, its appeal is gone.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There, I said it, and I'm not taking it back.  The characters, writing, acting, and even the CG is amazing.  I don't know how a rag tag group of actors got together with a rag tag director and produced such an amazing show.   <br /> <br />I'm not surprised this show got cancelled, however.  All I do is watch TV, and I didn't hear about this show until 2006. How did this amazing show escape my notice?  The idiots at Fox apparently have no idea what advertising is.  I pity them; this show could have been a blockbuster. I hope to God that someone at another network grows a brain and picks up this show.
B0000033P0|5.0|Five stars is not enough to rate this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Any serious keyboardist/synthesist will tell you that this is a landmark recording of the highest order. Many drummers will rate this album very high as well. Emerson's keyboard work and Palmer's drumming on the title track have stood the test of time impeccably.  <br /> <br />This is the album that single-handedly opened the door for me to the jazz and classical worlds when I was 13 years old. It blew me away, from the very first listen! Soon after listening to Tarkus I began taking piano and organ lessons and haven't stopped playing keyboards for the past 30 years. <br /> <br />This recording was so different from anything else out during that time that I had absolutely no one else to share this album with. In some regards this album was responsible for alienating me from the rest of society(most everyone else I knew during that time was listening to Zeppelin, Foreigner, Journey or disco! LOL!). I, on the other hand, was going in a totally opposite direction.  <br /> <br />From Tarkus the door was wide open and I moved on to Rick Wakeman's solo works, Chick Corea/Return to Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jean Luc Ponty, Weather Report/Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, Monk, McCoy Tyner and eventually to Tomita, Vangelis and other keyboard masters. Soon after, during my mid to late teens, I began listening to classical composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Bartok and the list goes on... <br /> <br />Tarkus is an album that is very dear to my heart and is by far the most influential piece of music I have ever listened to. <br /> <br />I recommend this recording to anyone who is a fan of keyboard music or a fan of rock-jazz. I especially recommend this CD to young people who are tired of the garbage that pop radio dishes out. If you are a teenager yearning for music that goes beyond the 2-4 minute pop format, or are thirsting for deep, complex music, then Tarkus is your ticket.  <br /> <br />Give this CD a try and perhaps you too will see the gem that is Tarkus.  <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but in this case I feel obligated.  I rented this movie out of curiosity about a month ago, and I thought it was amazing.  Great writing, acting, and production values.  I have never heard of any of the actors before and these guys are fantastic (I laughed, I cried, I laughed again). <br /> <br />To my surprise I learned that this movie was based on a cancelled TV show known as Firefly.  I proceeded to purchase the TV series and the movie and boy have I been pleasantly surprised.  I hate to admit it, but I think I've fallen in love with a TV show/movie and not since Titanic have I felt this way.   <br /> <br />I then proceeded to pass the DVDs on to my friends (who hate sci-fi) and they had the same reaction I did.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, buy this movie, and then the TV show, and block away a weekend.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I couldn't even remember this show airing just a few years ago. When I watched Serenity a few weeks ago, I felt that something was missing. That something was the TV show Firefly. The movie was fantastic and in the special features I discovered the crew of Serenity had flown before. I quickly purchased the Firefly box set. This is one of the best shows in recent memory. The writing is top notchm and the character development is a throw back to the original Star Wars. This is an adventure like no other. Check this out any way you can.  <br />
B000BTJDGC|4.0|If you like thrillers, get this DVD. The movie has a number of scenes that will make you gasp. It's an unsettling psychological thriller. If you like tense courtroom dramas, get this DVD. The court scenes rival those of such classics as A Few Good Men, The Verdict, and To Kill a Mockingbird. If you like movies with an excellent cast giving memorable performances, get this DVD. Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott & Jennifer Carpenter give strong performances. This is NOT your typical gory, bloody horror movie. It provides its share of thrills, but it has a strong story line. VERY good flick.
0307236722|5.0|Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook is a stunning and impressive tome that is user friendly, chock full of all the information the home baker needs to get inspired, get organized, get started and get better.  I gave it to my neice for Xmas and she loved it.  Using classic Martha style, I laid the handbook on top of a baking sheet lined with a sil-pad, tied them together with red ribbon, then attached a big bow with a Xmas tree shaped cookie cutter affixed to it.  My neice responded in kind by giving me a Martha inspired food basket on New Year's eve.  It was lined with a vintage dish towel, filled with wine, cheese, fresh fruit and scrumptious herb bread that she learned to bake from Martha's handbook.  Of course, my neice included a laminated copy of the recipe, a tip that Martha has shared many times.  Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook is a great gift anyway you slice it.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I never buy soundtracks.  I had to have this one after I saw the movie for the third time.  I have now seen the movie 10 times and love the music each time I hear it.  I can't imagine any other music for this movie.  It is perfect.  It is the new classical! <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay has become a staple in modern music. No matter who you are, it's unlikely that you have escaped their reach of sound waves. Their album sales have surpassed a staggering 10-million in the recent years. Sometimes I wonder if people just buy Coldplay CD's because it's the cool thing to do.<br /><br />Musically<br />+ There is no question that Coldplay has strong musicianship backing their albums. X&Y is no different. Chris Martin's vocals sit comfortably on the blend of Electro-Pop. The album is deeply textured with keys and guitar, percussion and synthesizers; amid the layers, it still keeps its musical focus.<br /><br />- The album is cool to chill out to, but seems to lack the energy of their previous albums. Songs like \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\" were gripping, but this collection seems to be lackluster in comparison.<br /><br />Spiritually<br />+ None<br /><br />- Other than vague sentences with pseudo-spiritual meanings, this album doesn't have much spirituality in it.<br /><br />Highlights<br />A Message, Fix You<br /><br />One Word: Calm<br /><br />***For more reviews like this one visit- [...]
B00003CWPL|4.0|ERASERHEAD is certainly not for everybody.  But for those who appreciate art films as much (or more than) mainstream narrative films, ERASERHEAD may be as close to perfection as an art film can get. <br /> <br />The very simple plot of the movie takes backseat to ERASERHEAD's atmosphere.  Through brilliant sound design, fantastic black and white photography, and the strangest of subjects on which to focus his camera, Lynch has created a fascinating, unnerving tone in this movie.  It is certainly not reality - it is, in fact, quite nightmarish - but Lynch masterfully lets this movie get just close enough to reality to make the nightmare atmosphere extremely chilling.  This film sticks with you, haunting your mind for days after you view ERASERHEAD. <br /> <br />The DVD comes with an odd but fascinating documentary on the (years long) production of ERASERHEAD.  It is one of the most interesting tales of a movie getting made I've ever heard.  Highly recommended... Check it out!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Do you still beleive? I watched this excellent \\"animated\\" Christmas movie for the first time and immediately fell in love with it. What a hit. Be sure to also read the great review by Mark Blackburn.<br /><br />It's about a young child who is skeptical about Christmas (Santa Claus) as a whole and discovers faith, the true faith, that truly lyes within. He decides to get on a \\"North-Bound\\" train and also discovers other kids who are also riding with him, as they all become companions, and the adventure to the North Pole begins.<br /><br />However a word of caution: I would not recommend this picture to young viewers unless you've had a chance to see it yourself. The first half of the movie is INTENSE, and full of big heart-stopping action. (I won't give it away).<br /><br />You have to see to BELEIVE !!!! And you have to BELEIVE to see.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0002OERI0|5.0|hey this album is one of there best but i do think they have sold out abit. if you want to hear some even better music, check out scope at [...] they are realy making it big time
B00063MBU8|1.0|Ugh, no words can really describe how this band churns my stomach. I think i could go to a fifth grade talent show and find a better band. They only people who like this type of music are  ugly, fat chicks. That is because my friends, they are depressed and this weiner singing for this band probaly sounds a lot like them.
B000006MS3|5.0|Although the sound of The Dreaming is a little different than prior albums (especially the first couple), it is a sound that goes absolutely great with Kate's voice. You'll find a funkier side of Ms. Bush on several of the tracks, but Kate Bush lovers need not worry about missing out on slower more melancholy songs, cause there are still a couple of those too. The \\"sound\\" of each track is similar enough without becoming repetitive, and the theme of the album runs strong through all the lyrics. From the start, this album just comes blasting out of the stocks. I can't claim that every song is perfect, but enough of them are to justify the 5 stars. Wonderful,wonderful album!
B00006DEF9|5.0|Produced when Technicolor was a revolutionary and seat-filling innovation, \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is, regardless of its many other claims to fame, a stunning example of how to use the medium's clear, saturated colours to incredibly powerful effect. Every scene is meticulously crafted to amplify the contrast, atmosphere & impact of the technology and, on this superb DVD rendition, they just jump out of the screen at you. <br /> <br />A truly amazing experience for this reason alone. Add-in its wonderful songs - including Gene Kelly's iconic title number, arguably the best song & dance routine of all time - its brilliant comic sequences - including Donald O'Connor's \\"Make `em Laugh\\" slapstick rollercoaster, arguably the slickest & funniest slice of cinema of all time (watch how he catches his hat towards the beginning... incredible) - and its charmingly optimistic, infectiously entertaining story-line and you've got something very special. <br /> <br />They don't make films like this any more; in fact they didn't make many, if any, films as good as this then. Pure cinematic brilliance - sit back and revel in it all. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is indeed a true masterpiece which easily stands out among the garbage candy artists these days...Confessions On A Dancefloor is a very hooky album as it will get hooked on you after a couple of times listening to it and this will go for years. I am really impressed by Madonna's song writing ability in all the 12 tracks on the album as she proves to be a true talented artist. This is the album that drives me further to explore her previous efforts such as \\"Music\\", \\"American Life\\", \\"Ray of Light\\" etc. and make a full collection of all her remastered albums, greatest hits album and non-essential EPs. As the \\"Special Limited Edition\\" of the album is still hot selling, go grasp it to get the bonus track \\"Fighting Spirit\\" and another bonus track \\"Super Pop\\" downloadable on becoming a member of the Madonna's fan club. The second single \\"Sorry\\" is the highlight of this album, as Pet Shop Boys have remixed it and this danceable PSB maxi-mix will appear on \\"Sorry\\" maxi-single. This album is way up in heaven if compared to Kylie's Body Language album, which should be way down deep deep in hell.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This film reminded me in a way of Tim Burton's 're-imaginings'; Terry Gilliam has taken the story of the Brothers Grimm and come up with a novel twist - but one that fails - this one has the Brothers as some kind of 'Ghost-busters' who go around solving ghostly problems for customers. <br /> <br />This is quite profitable for them until they are engaged by Jonathan Pryce to do a job, and it turns out there's a real super-natural crisis going on. <br /> <br />And Jonathan Pryce kept popping up in the most annoying sub-plot of the entire film!
B00000DG1R|5.0|I graduated from high school in 1986, so how could I not be a Duran Duran fan?  But their late 80s/early 90s stuff never held as much appeal to me, and my interest in the band faded over the years.  Happily, this amazing collection of their \\"Greatest\\" has rekindled my enthusiasm for this awesome group and their unique sound.<br /><br />I attribute my love of these CD in large part to the masterful sequencing of the songs.  \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" is not necessarily one of my top picks, but it definitely start things off right with its catchy beat.  The strong rhythms continue with the next two tunes, \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"A View to a Kill\\" (I always find that the latter stays in my head for days afterward).  Then, the tone of the album changes with the moody \\"Ordinary World,\\" an offering from 1993's altered band that I had previously ignored but am now quite partial too, and \\"Save a Prayer,\\" a sentimental favorite.  Several other songs from the mega-hit album Rio come next, followed by the best two tracks from their very first album, \\"Girls on Film\\" and \\"Planet Earth.\\"<br /><br />By this point in the CD (about halfway through), I don't even mind that there are four songs in a row from the previously-dreaded late 80s/early 90s era.  The next five tunes are all more recent (1990s/2000) offerings, and to my surprise, I found each one of these to be incredibly fun, upbeat, and amazingly familiar, although there were actually two that I hadn't heard before (\\"All She Wants Is\\" and \\"Electric Barbarella,\\" a homage to the movie which gave the band its name).  Finally, the compilation draws to a close with \\"Come Undone,\\" another gem from the group's 1993 incarnation.  If you are a fan of Duran Duran in any way, shape, or form, don't hesitate to buy this CD--I promise, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JO04|4.0|If I can sum this movie up in a phrase, it would be \\"disturbingly real\\". This movie is right in your face, with it's political and socio-economical views, that I was left in awe when the movie ended. This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I'm sure it took some guts to make this movie, and I can see why it's creating a whole lot of controversy. <br /> <br />First of, I will give a quick recount of what's happening in the movie, and trust me...this is the tricky part. The movie's frames are sliced with different scenes, different takes on different events going on. They are however linked, some more than the others. It basically involves a merger between 2 large oil companies, the corruption and deal-making behind it. How the power players squeeze situations to their advantage. There's also a succession of a Middle Eastern ruler which of course has it's own problems. There's also another angle where a couple of Pakistani youths are driven to terrosism. <br /> <br />While all that seems a little too much to digest, I thought it was written very well. It is not as detailed as I would've liked it to be, but that would require a 10-hour movie, if not longer simply because the issues tackled in this movie are very relevant in today's world. They provide a glimpse of what happens, or what could be happening behind the issues we read about in newspapers everyday. And the beauty of the script is, they take a look it it from a global and personal perpective as well. We are shown news reports, similar to what we watch in CNN, only to reveal shady proceedings that are inconsistent with what is being reported. Does this in a way, reflect what is really happening? We never know, which brings me to my next point. This movie uncovers a lot, yet leaves a lot to the viewer to decide. For example, I really felt for the Pakistani boys who got lured into terrorism. Keep in mind, I DO NOT condone terrorism of any kind but it was definitely an eye-opener to see things from the other side of the spectrum. It's sad that many people join terrorist causes, not because of religion or what they believe in but because of ignorance and abuse. After watching the movie, my friends and I were involved in a heated debate about various parts of the movie and how many movies can do that? <br /> <br />The amazing script is strengthened with exceptional performances from some of the best actors in Hollywood including Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper and William Hurt. But the star that outshines them all has got to be George Clooney. Who knew the doctor from ER had it in him. It's like he redeemed himself from all the mediocre/cringe-worthy (Batman and Robin anyone?) performances he's ever given us. He's character is not the main one here, yet everytime he appears...he astounds me with the degree of perfection he plays his character. Throughout the movie, he is ragged yet skillful, confused yet determined and  pulls of the character very well. Soon, the acting disappears and he's a CIA agent. I suspect he'll get an Oscar nomination for which, I for one thinks he truly deserves. These actors not only brought some talent to the movie, but they also took it to an emotional level. You feel for the characters, you begin to look at things their way, you care and want to understand what they're going through, how their mind works. <br /> <br />A lot has been said about the plot being confusing. Well, I understood the movie and so did everyone I spoke to. And no, I'm not a political science student or the chairman of a large conglomerate. True, some parts of the movie were filled with jargon used in the business/oil world and world politics, but if you're nitpicking on that fact, I believe you're missing the whole point. This movie offers so much more than what is being shown to us. By making this movie, director Stephen Gaghan paints a few broad strokes of an unusually large canvas that makes us question the values of life, of businessand war, of what's really important. I think, if the movie was able to do that..it is successful. Brilliantly conceived and well executed. Definitely one of my favourites.
0596009208|4.0|My programming experience:  I was a heck of a BASIC programmer in the day (late '80s/early '90s).  I've done a very little smidgen with ActionScript/Macromedia Flash.  I know some HTML, but that doesn't really count as programming (any idiot can figure out the tags).  That's it. <br /> <br />This book does a great job at getting at the concepts behind Java.  The exercises are helpful and relevant.  It's a better way of learning the language than through the programming classes I've been through (although they were much in past, I doubt much has changed).  For someone with very limited programming experience, like myself, it's been a great text to get a handle on Java. <br /> <br />However, some of the presentation is choppy.  For example, the discussion of using ArrayList classes for different types of objects is broken up over a few chapters.  It seems like they dive into it, don't tell you enough, go on to another topic, and then return to the original topic when you've already forgotten about it.  That's why it doesn't get five stars from me.  Although you have to learn things one step at a time, putting on the brakes at weird times in the instruction is awkward for the student/reader. <br /> <br />Still, it's a refreshing way of teaching a computer language.
0385507755|1.0|Spare me. The guy was in jail for two hours but calls his book a memoir, then writes he was in prison for 87 days (far from embellishing but blatant lies). This author would've been better off categorizing his book as fictitious or ridiculous. He went as far as lying about his own girlfriend's suicide. <br /> <br />His formulaic writing approach to tug at the heartstrings of readers everywhere for lessons he supposedly learned from all the \\"hardship\\", geez, merely displays a Poor little rich guy with a selfish little drive.
0385507755|5.0|I read this book back in December and kept thinking to myself that some of things mentioned could not be true, and come to find out they were not.  HOWEVER, the fact that the author lied DOES NOT change the fact that this is still an extremely well written book that is gripping from the moment you start reading it.  I am not advocating lying, I am simply saying that if you can get passed the fact about the lying and simply read the book I am sure you will agree with me about the quality of the book.  In fact, I still cannot wait to read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" and would not hesitate to pick up another James Frey book in the future.

Then let me help you out. This whole episode is not about Oprah, and it's not about you. I guess it's not really even about Frey. <br /> <br />You bought the book and loved it when it was the truth?

B00009Z576|4.0|After the great Tormato album came out I camped out all night for tickets and got 8th row front and center (although with the revolving round stage it wasn't as important it turned out).  I was flying high on YES then and was ready to go through the routine one more time when I heard Drama was coming!  The first songs that I heard were cool - Tempus Fugit, Does it Really Happen, Machine Messiah - but along side the usual great playing of Squire, Howe & White was this Jon SOUNDALIKE Trevor Horn.  I was indignant and in disbelief...anyone else is just a chipmunk in an off-white wedding dress!  Paaaahlease!  What, ya didn't think radioland would notice, or the real YES fans wouldn't MIND?  I basically dismissed the album, didn't buy it, and decided not to go to the concert when it came through (I ended up in Europe anyway so it didn't matter).  In the back of my mind though I would often think of a few of those songs, they were pretty good, no, damn good hard hitting songs.  Squire is particularly great here and White is really hammering those drums this time...and DAMN, Howe has a fire lit under his butt and almost tilts metal.  Okay, I relent: THE POWER OF YES IS TOO STRONG, even (whisper: without you know who).  There I said it, I do like this album alot, even more than 90125.  It is still not above the 70's albums in my mind, but it has great charms and is one of the best 80's rock albums I would say.  The Buggles really didn't ruin it, in fact I like this variation as a diversion, Horn can sing - just not like Anderson, which is fine.  Sometimes the keyboards sound a little too 80's, but they are cool nonetheless.  The Rhino remaster is absolutely stunning sounding up loud (YES albums are pretty slick, Eddie Offord made sure of that this time).  The packaging is great with lyrics, great track notes, original artwork, essay on the history, etc.  Some of the extras are INDISPENSABLE!  Tracks 9 & 10 are great Howe jam sketches that would have been so cool if fully developed.  14, 15 & 16 are like lost YES songs, especially Golden Age and In the Tower, not perfect but interesting and promising.  Try Dancing Through the Light with Drama, Sorry Trevor, I really don't think you are a soiled chipmunk in a wedding dress, YOU ROCK!  Get this classic, it is a gem.veloped.  14, 15 & 16 are like lost YES songs, especially Golden Age and In the Tower, not perfect but interesting and promising.

0895260131|5.0|Simple reading of the Koran shows discussion of war in every chapter. The \\"acheivements\\" of Islam are all based on war. In fact the very economy is as well.  <br /> <br />Islam did well as long as it expanded by warfare in the context of agrarian society where motivation of foot soldiers was the key to winning. Conquering continuously gives a supply of low cost land, goods and slaves into the economy. This allows currency to continuously deflate. A deflationary economy delivers real positive interest on money lent out when the formal interest rate is zero.  <br /> <br />What we see in Muslim history is that as soon as Islam was stopped, (the defeat at Tours) it had to tax unmercifully the outlying provinces. (Spain.) It also had to stop allowing converts into Islam because doing so would prevent the people of places like Spain from propping up the empire's coffers.  <br /> <br />This led to to the revolt that for the first time reversed the fortunes of Islam when they lost Spain. This loss plunged the Muslim empire into an economic depression. Currency no longer had a real rate of positive return. In that context the Abassid dynasty's attempt to reform Islam and declare the Koran to be the words of man, not divine writ, failed to take hold.  <br /> <br />Islam is simply a war cult. The leader, Mohammed, was a vicious psychopath with all the classic signs of psychopaths. His conduct is recorded in Ha'dith. It differs little from David Koresh or Jim Jones except that Mohammed lived in a time when such creeps could take over the known world.  <br /> <br />Even so, Mohammed is an aberration. No other religious leader of a major religion that made it big was a psychopath. Jesus was not, nor was Gautama. Certain popes probably were.  <br /> <br />The world, and the West should not respect Mohammed. His life and works do not deserve respect any more than the life and work of Foday Sankoh deserve respect. Mohammed was simply an evil little man without redeeming qualities who had enough charisma and luck to hit the big time.
0307276902|1.0|This book was published as a non-fiction by a so called \\"recovered addict\\" and now an admitted liar.  The problem is how can we be certain he is recovered (sober)  from his chemical and alcohol dependency in order to trust the facts of his testimony and that his questionable 'innovated' method of becoming free, clean and sober worked for him then and is it still working for him now?  <br /> <br /> Thru his admission, this was written as fiction as it was greatly embellished but he could only get it published as non-fiction. This is the route he and the publisher chose to go in order to sell the book.  Frey hasn't come clean yet on the actual truths of the book other than he was an addict admitted to a rehab center.  He didn't write this book to help those dealing with addictions or as a how to book. He wrote it for pure entertainment.  It was the publisher and Oprah who jumped on the theme that , \\"wow, look how this man turned his life around...this book brings hope to and should be read by.....\\".  The book doesn't take the reader that far out of Frey's so called recovery........in fact, we're left hanging to see if he ever did commit to his jail sentence and how many times he stuck his nose in a glass of booze before he drunk like a fish.  Even if this book was 1/4 true, we don't know anything from this book of how or IF he turned his life around.  All we know is he was discharged out of a rehab center without completing a 12 step program; just picking 3 of the 1st 4 steps to haphazardly do..if you can call that working the steps,  thought AA/NA was a cult, had a genuine dislike for GOD, continuously intervened in Lilly's recovery and was a major cause for her relapse, through his own stupidity and lack of street smarts was recruited by Leonard the mobster, and basically told everyone to shove it as he wasn't going to get sober their way. Which in fact is what he did as an addict.  We don't even know the true story of how in got into rehab in the first place. Uponleaving the rehab center, he certainly retained his addiction personality.  That's a main character flaw he was unable to change. A personality of anger, resentment, and lies. You read it throughout his novel.  We are left at the end of the book knowing this is the personality that he will keep until he bottoms out again or receives some serious therapy.  How does one expect change if they continue doing the same old thing the same old way?  We only are made aware of how he changed from addict to recovered are by statements made by Oprah and the publisher and they have admitted they both were duped.  I think now, even Frey got caught up in this 'hero' and 'one of a kind' mentality and doesn't know how to back out. He's stuck..........right where he's been all his life. <br />Unfortunately anything we hear from Frey can not be taken as truth given his addictive personality that is obvious still within.  Those of you that want to know what an addict's life is about.........bottom line; the book wasn't written for that purpose. Oprah got duped. If you think like Larry King, (\\"how could he write it if he hasn't experienced it?\\"), by goodness I guess that takes creativity out of our English language. Come on naive Larry King!  <br /> <br />As far as those that say \\"who cares about the truth?\\".  The answer is those of us that care about addicts, recovered or not,  are concerned that they tell the truth.  We understand how important the TRUTH is to their recovery.  No Truth, No recovery. <br /> <br />My 'gut' feeling is that Frey the author is as phony as his fairy tale books.  If you're looking for an honest, sincere, truthful and helpful view into the life of a addict and recovery from, this certainly is NOT the book for you. This book is written either by a dry drunk or an addict not in recovery for purely entertainment purposes and to make a fast buck.  Keep in mind, addicts are VERY creative. <br />
0062502182|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\"...it was one of the best books I have ever read. I would have to say it would be in my top 15 of all time. It constantly had me on the edge of my seat, I nearly fell off of it. This book was very different and something I would have never expected it to be. It isn't inappropriate at all. It was very interesting as well. Everyone deserves to read this book in their life sometime.
0307276902|5.0|I know there is all this controversy about how James Frey lied and it isn't a memoir anymore but a novel.  But does that really matter?   <br /> <br />A Million Little Pieces was, in my honest opinion the best book I've ever read.  I read it last year before all this madness ensued so I had a clear-cut \\"honest\\" view of the story and not an Oprah/Letterman skewed view of it.  This book is intense, riveting, and written in a poetic, artistic, and very visual way.  <br /> <br />Yes, it is a little upsetting that the story is now fiction, but a story is a story and I can't say that it has change my view on it at all. <br /> <br />If no one anticipated embellishment, than people have to start reconsidering literature.  Think what you want, but this book was fabulous in every way.  It leads in perfectly to My Friend Leonard and both, no matter how exaggerated or untruthful, are excellent books.
0783225547|5.0|Enough of that stupid lava, magma effects. The outrageous, over the top plans, scenes, and people screaming at the top of their lungs. This movie had NONE of that to be honest. It had wonderful acting, amazing plot, and the greatest effects that I have seen in a natural disaster movie. So I can sum up that this film is really good, one of my #1 favorites, and recommended for everyone.
1577314808|1.0|My subversive suggestion is this: Eckhart Tolle did not have an enlightenment experience at all, save for the kind of enlightenment that comes from a thorough reading of spiritual literature. I have this doubt because true enlightenment to me seems mutually exclusive of the kind of condescending tone Tolle uses through-out his book. I think we all expect a more compassionate voice from spiritual leaders, a caring style of communication which empathizes with the frailty of the human condition. But I could be wrong! Perhaps haughtiness is in vogue for today's gurus. <br /> <br />Along that same line, Tolle continually comes across as a big know-it-all. He loves to be Tolle the Physicist, with his multiple references to the \\"high energy frequency of presence.\\" Then there's Tolle the Geologist: \\"Even a stone has rudimentary consciousness; otherwise it would not be, and its atoms & molecules would disperse.\\" And we have Tolle the Biologist: \\"The accumulation of time as the psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cell's capacity for self-renewal.\\" If an appendix were included with associated references to scientific research, his statements might have some credibility. But as it is, they don't, and for any reader with a modicum of critical thinking skills, these statements, along with many others, are met with puzzlement or just immediate dismissal. <br /> <br />A third observation from reading this book is that the author likes to make these grand, sweeping, unrealistically pessimistic statements about society which again are met with puzzlement. For example, \\"Because we live in such a mind-dominated culture, most modern art, architecture, music, and literature are devoid of beauty, of inner essence, with very few exceptions.  ...No civilization has ever produced so much ugliness.\\" (p.81)  Is that really so? And: \\"...we live in a culture that is almost totally ignorant of death, as it is almost totally ignorant of anything that truly matters.\\" (p.118)I doubt this is the case for the 12 million health-care workers in the U.S. who give their hearts out to the sick & dying every day, not to mention the countless citizens who are caring for their ageing & dying parents.  <br /> <br />I think it's with remarks like these where Tolle's lack of compassion (due in part to his haughtiness and distorted world views) comes across as hurtful or offensive to everyday people who by their actions exhibit deep thoughtfulness about things which truly matter.  <br />
B000002GB9|5.0|Yep, my first Styx cd. Got it for Christmas. I've I always liked Styx since I heard the legendary Come Sail Away but never got  any of their albums until my mother gave me her Pieces of Eight and Paradise Theater lp's. As for the album itself, it's pretty solid. It is a good mixture prog rock, pop rock, and areana rock. The first three songs are a great mixture of the above said different 'rocks', though the first two are less progressive. Then you have C.S.A., I'm not going to write an essay about this song but just trust me, it's excellent. It's the best song on the album.Five and six are pretty good and are probably the hardest songs on the cd. Song seven comes in a close second to C.S.A. and is the most progressive of all the songs. The keys in the middle are so sick! When I first heard it I thought of the theme of Halloween. Yes, thats right! The last song is like a combination of the first four songs and is a decent closer. This is a very good album, and anyone who is into, prog, pop rock, or is just into good music, doen't pass this one up.
0380002930|5.0|What more can be said about Watership Down?? Its everything that a piece of literature should be: thought-provoking, creative, and supremely entertaining. Whether you wish to disect the allegory in the book, or simply follow it as a charming and fun story about a group of rabbits, the bottom line is you will enjoy this book.      One of the wonderful things that Adams accomplishes with Watership Down is to humanize the rabbits: their characters and traits are recognizable and relatable, so you actually care about them. In addition to fine characterization, Adams throws in action, suspense, and a noble quest to weave a near-perfect tale. As a side note, Adams' followup Tales Of Watership Down is vastly inferior to the original, but is still a decent read.  If you have not read this book, please do yourself the favor. Watership Down also makes a great gift for any avid readers you might know (just be sure to first find out whether they already own it!).
B00004Y87O|5.0|This is classic Carpenter at his best.  I have literally seen this movie at least 150 times.  Carpenter stretched this film to the very limits, where cheese meets darkness and survival, and ended up with a brilliant film that made me want to be Snake Pliskin for Halloween four years in a row!!!! If you love end of society movies, but don't take them to seriously, then this is the flick for you!!!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Why people hate The Bourne Supremacy I have no idea but what I loved about this sequel was they got rid of a very weak piece of the cast right in the beginning. You break your neck to see this because you want to know the rest of the story and who Jason Bourne really is but when you get to the end to find all that out and well that's all you find out.<br /><br />You don't get a plot twist or anything to make your jaw drop; you just get a plain old mediocre answer to a plain question. One example of a film with a plot somewhat related to this but made it into a giant surprise is Kill Bill and I'm saying this as in when everything was getting to the end Uma Thurman found out her daughter was still alive. While The Bourne Supremacy has a little bit of a boring ending it still is a great movie thanks to Matt Damon and a few others pulling off great fight sequences much like the first film but more extreme.<br /><br />They did manage make a much needed and surprising change in the beginning of the film that makes it better in every way. Damon definitely isn't the best actor in here once again but he is great in these action scenes. There are a few people that become backstabbers but it's nobody you didn't already guess were villains in the first film. Bourne Supremacy is worth watching but you may get bored towards the ending.
0307276902|1.0|Frey got those anecdotes the no-risk way: he stole them from a real druggie/criminal author. A much better and more honest one, a guy named Eddie Little-specifically, Frey looted Little's great debut novel, Another Day in Paradise.  <br /> <br />Little wrote a column called \\"Outlaw L.A.\\" that ran when Frey was living in LA writing bad movies (eg Loving A Fool). I think Ruth's hunch was right: Frey, like the thief and conman he is, read Little's column, then his book, and started stealing. Naturally, he cut the key element of Little's books: the unhappy endings. The fake transformations suckers demand.  <br /> <br />Another lie, those transformations; people live and die as unvaryingly as insects. Frey himself illustrates this perfectly. He was a yuppie schemer from birth, a trust-fund bum with a roof rat's adaptive, though repellent traits: a rat cunning and lack of shame.  <br /> <br />Since Frey knows nothing about drugs and cares nothing for truth, he opts for the most lurid, criminal version of druggie life. He knows you pious hypocrites love that stuff. So he stole Little's stories, carefully leaving out all the good parts. See, that's the key: y'all like Frey not despite his weakness as a writer but because of it.  <br /> <br />Compare his stories with Little's and you'll see this. Little generates horror and triumph without resorting to tearjerking; Frey zooms to the weepy scenes, too ignorant to fake the details he doesn't know and too cynical to care about filling in his crude narrative.  <br /> <br />Compare outcomes: Little paid for his knowledge of junkie-dom and died a junkie's death; Frey stole Little's scars, tears and knowledge, skipped the weird stuff and sold you a cut-and-paste tale of tears ending with redemption, a hymn with a lot of curse words to cut the treacly taste.  <br />
B00023B1LC|4.0|First I'm just reviewing this movie and I have never read the Bourne Novels nor have I seen the old Miniseries from 1988 so I am comparing this movie to nothing. My one and only problem with this film is the leading female actress Franka Potente (Marie), I don't know if it was her character that was annoying or just her in general. She was constantly in the way and almost making you want something to happen to her character.<br /><br />It almost seems like the producers thought if they put a girl who isn't all that cute and has mediocre acting skills then there's no way she could out shine Matt Damon and boy did it work. For a minute you start to think Matt is playing his role a bit weak but then you realize he's good at playing a man who has lost his memory. The fight sequences are fantastic and this is where you start to give a little respect because all the fights are perfect but I think they could of used a little bit more of them, maybe two or three.<br /><br />The plot kind of reminds you of the Replacement Killers when Chow Yun-Fat wasn't able to assassinate the cop because the guys son was right there with him when he tried to do it but Chow wasn't trained by the government and definitely not as dangerous or exciting. If your watching this thinking it's a movie where you start to feel for the characters then don't bother with it, Bourne didn't even show too much feelings for his new love Marie. This is a plain old action flick with a nice and interesting story. Overall this is a movie that will have you loving it for the action and the crazy car chase in the Mini Cooper but I really think another leading actress was needed.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I had just read and reviewed a book on Madagascar so I was really interested when my granddaughter and I watched this movie. I'm telling you it was great. I won't go into the story as you can read about it yourself in these reviews, but I will tell you there were so many fun things about watching it that I'm still smiling.<br /><br />The storyline is great, the soundtract oustanding, visuals bring every activity to life, animation supurb and the characters are a chuckle a minute.  My top favorite, \\"GLORIA, the hippo.\\" Why is it that I believe I know some humans that remind me of Gloria.<br /><br />You have to see this one, with or without a child. It truly is entertainment at its best.  Sit back, relax, giggle and enjoy. Recommended.
0307276902|5.0|After all the controversy, I am still glad I read both of James Frey's books. They were both meaningful and entertaining to me and that will not change despite what has been said.   <br /> <br />I wish James all the best and hope he can move on.
0739301985|3.0|Unfortunately for many, Christmas can be a stressful time of year despite it's importance to those with Christian faith. The story is of Luther Crank, who is fed up with the commercial aspects of Christmas. He decides to propose a plan to skip Christmas for a year and go on vacation with his wife while their daughter is away in the Peace Corps. They take this idea to an extreme, and the two make a pact to skip all aspects of Christmas including the office parties, and decorations.  This is a much harder task than it would seem, with the various social pressures to take part in such rituals, and Luther and his wife seem to find themselves in many difficult situations and even labeled \\"grinches\\", etc... The story builds as the reader becomes interested in whether they will actually be able to pull this off.  It also takes some clever turns toward the end. This story is entertaining and clever for anyone who wants a quick read during the Christmas holidays, but lacks a greatness of many other Christmas tales.  Still, Grishman's descriptive writing will pull you in, and you will want to find out what happens next.
B000062X90|5.0|I must say the enthusiasm of the other reviewers is contagious.  But that's easy to understand when I (like so many of us) have had years--DECADES--to fully engage and internalize the unique dynamics of this GREAT band. Not that you need decades to warm to the heat of this highly-polished gem of a hard rock.<br /><br />It's totally unfair to single \\"Argus\\" out as the one Wishbone Ash recording to buy, but alas, if one MUST be selected, I fear this has to be it.  To me, you absolutely can't go wrong with ANY of their first five records, but I'd also have to say that the full spectrum of WA's talent came to full fruition with \\"Argus,\\" (the band's third release) AND this was as close as they ever came to a prog-rock concept album.  To this propeller-head, that makes \\"Argus\\" uniquely distinctive AND especially worthy of comment and praise.<br /><br />Another reviewer nailed it when he identified the lyrical themes of the album as \\"war & rememberance.\\"  Although their lyrics were never (for me anyway) the group's strongest attribute, I do admire their willingness to attempt such ponderous subjects and pull them off without sounding dumb.  Naturally it helps to have the incredible Martin Turner singing for you, surely one of the greatest unheralded voices in British rock.  And, let me be quick to add, his bass playing is equally underappreciated--Martin's nimble skill stands alongside or surpasses more widely celebrated (and stylistically similar) peers like Paul McCartney, Chris Squire, or John Entwistle.<br /><br />To me, these guys were the complete package--they could write GREAT songs, EVERY member was an outrageously talented musician, and they fearlessly took their show \\"on the road\\" practically every year, playing the shabby halls of the USA Midwest in the '70's with great panache.  In fact, they got busted here in my own home town back in 1973 for smoking pot in one of our bars after they finished their show. Hard to believe they didn't \\"catch a buzz\\" from the smoky arena they'd just played, where the very next week veterans with bolo ties would be swapping agates...<br /><br />Guitarist Andy Powell keeps the band going today, and their recent releases are totally consistent with the harmonic twin-guitar sound they pioneered in the '70's.  The new musicians (I hate to call them sidemen) are more than competent and so for me, as long as Andy's willing to keep pumping it out, I'll keep listening.  But I know they'll never write another song to equal the spellbinding drama of \\"The Pilgrim\\" (from album #2, \\"Pilgrimage\\").  Listen to that neck-breaking, propulsive drumming of the never-got-his-due Steve Upton; a veritable rock & roll Buddy Rich, as far as I'm concerned.  And we can hardly ignore those string-melting, brain-scorching flying V solos by Andy (and Stratocaster partner Ted Turner).  Nor will we ever get riveting ballads like \\"Persephone\\" (from \\"There's the Rub,\\" WA #5) or \\"Sorrel\\" (from Wishbone #4), impressive not only for their soaring Martin Turner vocals (and band harmonizing on \\"Sorrel\\") but equally meritorious for the precise and IN-TENSE bass/guitar/drum interplay between the entire quartet.<br /><br />But back to \\"Argus.\\" This is the work of a young band fully taking flight with a unified piece of great ambition.  For those of us who were there, this was an EXCITING time to be a music fan; so many teenagers (like me) who grew up under the spell of the Beatles & Stones were now hearing the next generation of bands emerging with their own take on what the basic \\"rock\\" template was capable of.  Wishbone Ash was just one of an explosion of great bands that jockeyed for some sunlight back then, and I'm glad to be able to try to carry a little forward on their behalf for the benefit of receptive ears today.

0307276902|5.0|Whether you are RUNNING WITH SCISSORS or you are DRY, I believe you are taking liberties with a life which takes more than its fair share of liberties with you.<br /><br />I agree with one thing: the country (Anderson included!) should really focus their attention on the life + death matters facing us all, and I know Anderson cares, unless he's been taking acting lesson. Hell, I'll even take more Katrina coverage over this book, the Menendez kid, Mr. Dunne, Ms. Hilton and (oh, I forgot) the gal who disappeared in Aruba and the guy who disappeared from the cruise ship. Sad, but there are lives lost there, and let's not forget the folks defending us overseas, so we can have CNN in NYC. I wonder how many service personnel died during the making of these shows (Oprah, Larry, AC360...)<br /><br />I'm giving a book I've never read, and don't really think I'm going to read, 5 stars because Mr. Frey was (somehow) fortunate to parlay WHATEVER he wrote into 15,000,000 serious minutes of TV coverage.<br /><br />I plan, however, to read IN COLD BLOOD. I'm ashamed I haven't done so already.<br /><br />And I'm in this for my book and movie deal too! Oprah? I'm waiting...
B00004YC2F|5.0|Sergei Rachmaninoff's compositions are often lumped in with other Russian nationalist composers, like Rimsky-Korsakov who wanted to raise the state of Russian music by incorporating modes and folk-elements of their native land into the mainstream.  With Rachmaninoff, you get the feeling his music is Russian, but without selling out; he avoided in most cases, overtly inserting folk-sounds, but instead, composed classical music which was greatly influenced by his environment and surroundings.<br /><br />The opening of his Piano Concerto No. 3 in d minor, is a fine example of that.  A simple unison melody for piano, with simple orchestral accompaniment seems delicate, classically balanced, and tuneful, but the integrity of the melancholy nature seems to listeners as Russian.  The theme returns three times, each time as charming and fondly remembered as the first.  A more positive secondary melody speaks of love and yearning, evoking Rachmaninoff's highly Romantic compositional style.  After the second reprise is a passionate piano cadenza (Volodos choose the longer one), bringing the moods of both motives.  The d minor opening movement has a feel of forward movement without being rushed, and the lush Romantic orchestration is colorful and dramatic.  The second movement has a potpourri of emotions, including a few reoccurring important ideas.  The opening pastoral string section continues the mood of the opening movement, but when the piano enters, it becomes a peaceful pastoral scene.  In contrast, a great sweeping theme of passionate emotion, in an almost exotic mode, takes over from time to time, again, rooting the listener in a Russian composition.  A brash conclusion links the second movement to the third with a whirlwind scalular passage for orchestra and piano.  The final movement begins with a forceful idea, again in the minor, which modulates around creating an interesting kaleidoscope of colors, much like the opening.  A whimsical scherzo, along with a reprise of the opening movement's \\"love\\" theme gives the final movement an emotional pastiche feel.  The work ends in an upbeat key, with broad Romanticism and stunning virtuosic athleticism.  The final movement is a work-out for both orchestra and pianist.<br /><br />This recording features James Levine and the Berlin Philharmonic.  Levine, the conductor of the Metropolitan Orchestra, has a natural timing for drama, and it aids this performance of a highly dramatic, Romantic work.  The Berlin Philharmonic is full-bodied and accompanies well (the piano rarely takes a break); although, I feel the orchestra could be more present, especially in the opening movement and parts of the third, where the orchestra is sometimes obscured by the piano.  Levine also keeps the music moving forward, never langoring in over-Romanticization, a plus for this performance (leaves the listener wanting more).  The engineers know who the star of the concerto is; Arcadi Volodos gives an extroverted performance of the concerto and is placed forward in the recording.  He is delicate and sensitive at need, but really shines in the virtuosic arena.  Minus the slight balance issue, this is a stupendous performance, if not the finest, at 40 minutes.<br /><br />An extra 20 minutes of Rachmaninoff's solo piano repertoire is added to the concerto.  The etude tableaux in c-sharp minor, no. 6(9), preludes in d minor and f minor, romance in f minor, serenade in b-flat minor, and Volodos' transcription from a cello sonata is included.  Showcasing sensitivity, as well as athletic virtuosity, the pieces fill out the CD nicely.  Interpretively, this CD can stand with most, sonically, it outdoes most.  If you are looking for just the 3rd concerto only, this is an easy recommendation of a digital recording.  Many labels, however, put out combinations of concertos, which might appeal to a larger consumer base.

B00004W52U|5.0|I think I've only met one person who doesn't like Operation Ivy.  How could you not?  They have the raw energy of punk and the catchy rythm of ska which makes for songs that are awesome as sh*t.  If this album doesn't get you pumped, nothing will.
B000AY807Q|4.0|By now I'm sure everyone knows who Neil Young is, so I'll just start by saying that some people might look at Prairie Wind as the album that almost didn't happen. Not only did Neil lose his father and the mother of his first child prior to its recording, but he also suffered a brain aneurysm DURING its recording. Fortunately, though, all this seemed to give him the motivation he needed to produce one of his best albums.<br /><br />My favorite song is the title track, but another song not to miss is \\"He Was the King\\", a silly but funky tribute to Elvis Presley. Those are really the only upbeat songs on here, but Neil does still score with mellow songs, like \\"The Painter\\" and especially \\"It's a Dream\\". \\"Here For You\\" is also an interesting take on the I'll-be-there-for-you ballad.<br /><br />Neil's vocal has always had sort of an acquired taste (see \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\"), which is why this album gets 4-1/2 stars instead of 5. But songs like \\"This Old Guitar\\" makes you forget all about that. Prairie Wind is a nice breezy album that you ought to have in your collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00003CWPL|4.0|But don't watch it unless you want even stranger dreams.  <br /> <br />A strange movie and definitely stays with you. I enjoyed it. It it somewhat like his other movies or a William Faulkner novel, in that you notice additional imagery or points of interest with each viewing. The sounds of the industrial city, spewing forth their mysterious product 24/7, will stay with you, keeping you awake at night.  <br /> <br />According to IMDB.com, Jack Nance was a victim of a homicide in Los Angeles.
B000BTJDG2|5.0|In terms of acting, this is one of the top two horror movies I've seen ... the other being Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Jennifer Carpenter is excellent as the very sick Emily. She's a natural athlete and pulled off the possession with minimal special effects. The horror scenes are well paced very creepy (without using gore) and most importantly ... realistic. Instead of taking place in an isolated country home ... the demonic visitations happen at a very ordinary looking university. Though I must admit Emily's dorm looks more like a mental hospital than anything else.<br /><br />Because of the intense realism I couldnt sleep after watching this. I don't face my bedroom closet when in bed so I kept craning my neck to see if a monster was waiting ....
B0000AM6LY|3.0|I am giving this album 3 stars because I only like track 3 on this album \\"Sunrise\\". <br />My friends mom told me that she heard this new song at the time by Hall and Oates and she said it sounded like they made an updated version \\"I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\\" which is one of my all time fave songs. She said it was really good but could not find a single for it. I just happened to be watching VH1 and caught a new video by Simply Red called \\"Sunrise\\" after watching the video I realized that it sounded a lot like the Hall and Oates song... I was thinking this is good...has a good beat to it...and the singing is incredible on this song...so I decided to go out and buy the album... my friends mom listened to it and she was like yeah this is the song! So she went out and bought the album...but I was a bit disappointed with it. <br /> <br />The first track \\"Home\\" wasn't a good placement for an opener because it's not strong and upbeat and doesn't draw you into the album ...but it is beautifully sung and I like the piano in it.  <br /> <br />\\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Money In My Pocket\\" don't even fit on this album. These 2 would fit better with maybe \\"Love And The Russian Winter\\" after the track \\"Ain't That A Lot Of Love\\".  <br />The rest of the album lacks anything unique...way too mellow for my taste. <br /> <br />So again 3 out of 5 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like millions of others, I missed the broadcast of Firefly back in 02. But then again, I'm not one spending much time with any of today's network or cable offerings. The \\"push\\" FOX gave the show obviously wasn't what it deserved for so many regular TV viewers to have missed it as well. Throw in the other deliberate blunders, and well, we know now what a precious moment of television entertainment slipped into the black.  <br /> <br />Mid December 2005: Looking through Amazon's top-selling dvds for gift ideas, Serenity jogs my memory... saw the preview at Batman Begins and thought it looked like something I'd like to see but never did. So, I check the reviews and Firefly gets mentioned in nearly every one. Back to the list and there's Firefly in the Top Ten with five stars and I'm baffled that I've never heard of it. Needless to say, after reading at least a dozen customer reviews I knew I had to have this duo of dvds - sight unseen, blind purchase - because the enthusiasm leapt from the screen; these weren't just viewers, they were genuine fans. And most of them, like me, were accidental, delightfully surprised fans. Somehow, the signal had caught their attention - it got mine. In spite of my wife's objections, I spent the money. And on Christmas day, we unwrapped the gift (to \\"Dad & The Boys\\") that the whole family, wife and daughter included, has come to cherish more dearly with each and every viewing -- time and time again.  <br /> <br />At 45, should I be ashamed to be so exited over a TV show and movie? Not at all! It's made me feel young again. I'm pleading with friends to get Firefly like I begged my Mom and Dad to go see Star Wars - the elation over Joss Whedon's characters, their stories and the patiently evolving plot seems just as fresh for TV now as Mr. Lucas' did for movies then. You'll be quoting lines, speculating on character's pasts, pondering future storylines, and wanting see episodes again just to take it all in. Then... you'll want to tell others. If fact, I'm hosting a \\"Firefly Hospitality Night\\" next week to show the intended pilot episode and the network's forced-pilot to a group of friends. I'm confident they'll be Browncoats themselves soon thereafter.  <br /> <br />If you're reading this and have not seen Firefly and especially Serenity, the blessing of dvd technology is allowing you and thousands of others to treasure something FOX grossly mistreated. You'll see episodes in their proper order and after finishing them you can watch the movie Serenity to bring a little closure to the unfinished TV series. And if you've seen Serenity, Firefly will take you deeper into the story like Star Wars: Episode III - only much, much more gratifying.  <br /> <br />I'm not one to tell folk how to spend their hard-earned cash (or to go further into debt), but... buy these two dvds!! You'll thank me or whoever told you to check out the reviews at Amazon for Firefly - or maybe a greater power in the verse led you here? <br /> <br />Now, I'm hoping the execs in TV-land will find the beautiful gem they dropped, pick it up with a kiss of joy and place it back where it belongs... in our homes weekly.
0440217563|5.0|Again, Galabdon does a wonderful job of spinning a web of vibrant, realistic characters.  It's easy to get emotionally involved with the lives of these people.  I was slightly amused that Jamie has almost a super hero quality.. there's nothing he can't do, nothing that can mortaly hurt him.... But thank God for it, what would we do if something happened to Jamie?!  I have learned one lesson ... always buy the next book in the series BEFORE you finish the current one.

1577314808|5.0|There are a few reviews here that don't recomend this book.  Because of this I almost did not purchase the book.  I eventually decided to go ahead and get the book anyway.  I can truly say that this is one of the best books I have read.  I purchased the audio book too so that I could listen at work.  I must have read the book 3 times and listened to the audio book more times than I can recall.   <br /> <br />I feel that Eckart has found enlightenment, and I have found what he says works.  His chapter on the pain body is fantasic; and I also love his chapter on focusing on the inner body.  I also mediate with Holosync from Centerpointe Research Institue (Please see the book Thresholds of the Mind to learn more about Holosync).  Together, I have found that The Power of Now and Holosync have been the most effective tools toward my goal of inner peace and spiritual growth (I have tried several different programs and read many books throughout the years).   <br /> <br />I strongly suggest the audio book.  His voice (to me anyway) is so peaceful and relaxing.  This book may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I am glad that I didn't take the advice of the negative reviews here and got it anyway.  If you do get the book, I hope that you find it as helpful as I have on my journey.  <br /> <br />Be well.
0307276902|5.0|it's a riveting work of writing.  They said this book sold only because there was a person behind the story.  Someone needs to call BS on the TV people.  This book would have sold as non-fiction just as well.  John Grisham sold books about fictional attorneys without saying he was the guy in the novels.  Oprah said she was \\"embarrassed\\" and \\"duped\\".  Let's see, is Harpo productions some little outfit?  I don't think so.  No due diligence process?  Come on.  Someone needs to call BS on this publicity stunt.  This drama put on by Oprah smells more than the funny \\"altered\\" details of the book.  Are we the one's being duped by Oprah?  I know that even most small outfits have due diligence.  Oprah tore this guy apart today and you know they all staged it before the show by telling each other how it was going to go and that everyone was going to walk away rich after he took his lashes.
0307276902|4.0|James Frey is a brilliant fiction writer. If he would market this book and My Friend Leonard as fiction, and see how they do against other fictional accounts, then it's a level playing field. But to write fiction and label it nonfiction, isn't that a sin? But it's easy to see why he does it. <br /> <br />All unrecovered addicts rely on the co-dependents around them to enable their lying. Can you imagine any other best-selling author appearing on Larry King with his MOTHER? James Frey and his puppy-dog act on Oprah's show brought out the fierce loyalty enablers have toward addicts and their bad behavior. Ah, he can't help it. So what if he's lying. What does it matter?  <br /> <br />And that's why unrecovered people like Frey keep lying, and drunks keep wrecking families and abusers keep lashing out. There's a lot of support for it. Who would enablers be if they weren't enabling?
B000BWI9U0|5.0|The Strokes are by far my favorite band to come onto the scene in recent years. In my opinion, their songwriting is unmatched by other bands like The Killers, or The Vines, etc. Not even close. <br /> <br />\\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" - the band's third album - is truly a charm! I knew it was going to be excellent when I heard \\"Juicebox\\" on iTunes. I was really looking forward to its release.... and it did not disappoint. The band really seem to be developing as PLAYERS as well as songwriters. The guitar solos are weirder than before, and the arrangements are more complex. Julian's vocals are not SO masked in that weird filter the way it was on \\"Is This It\\" - showing his capabilities as a strong rock vocalist.  <br /> <br />\\"You Only Live Once\\", \\"Juicebox\\", \\"Heart In A Cage\\", and \\"Razor Blade\\" - the first four songs on the album - are particular highlights for me. \\"Electricityscape\\" has a neat 12-string guitar part in it - the first time I've heard 12-string guitar on a Strokes song. \\"Killing Lies\\" is an example of what The Strokes do better than anyone these days - simple, strummy, strolling rock and roll. It reminds me a little of \\"When It Started\\" from their debut album. \\"Fear Of Sleep\\" is an interesting song that begins in true Strokes fashion - with choppy guitar strumming, and a lead guitar part that shadows Julian's vocals.. but then breaks with a tremelo guitar chords and Nikolai's bass runs. \\"Fifteen Minutes\\" sounds like a drinking song at first - even Julian sounds drunk... but, it then picks up into a more frenzied pace more typical of a Strokes rocker. \\"Ize of the World\\" is classic Strokes with Julian delivering a great meldoy, and nice guitar work (I think Albert takes the lead on this one). \\"Evening Sun\\" is a beautiful song with wonderfully understated instrumentation and sensitive vocals. The album closes out with \\"Red Light\\" which is a great bouncy little ditty which - like this entire album - has great hooks, guitar and bass parts and loose drumming by Fab. <br /> <br />If you are a Strokes fan at all, you are going to love \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\". I can't say it is \\"better\\" than \\"Is This It\\", but it's darn close. I never bought \\"Room On Fire\\" (out of fear that it could not live up to their debut release), so I can't compare it to that album.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a piece of propaganda.  To  call the guy a filmmaker is laughable.  He clearly hates this country.  His story was clearly biased and one sided.  Therefore, it caries no weight and can only be described as propaganda.  If it was a comedy I would have gave it at least one more star.  One guy in a recent review gave it 5 stars followed by a comment that he is from Yemen and hates this country and its people.  I say ... \\"get the eff out then you pathetic piece of garbage\\".  I certainly Hope our men & women aren't dying for your pathetic back side.  I hate Yemen and their people.  So these are the type of people that love this movie.  Read some of the 5 star reviews.  They are from radical left wing nut jobs.  For example, read a 5 star review and then click to see what else they have reviewed.  There is your answer.  Go figure.  Michale Moore is not a disgrace and an embarrassment to the human race because he has an opinion, its because it distorts his opinion to convince people to hate his county as he does.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never written a review of anything here before or anywhere else.  I never get fanatical about tv shows or movies, but I have to count myself as a genuine fan of firefly.  It's a great show with amazing writing and highly loveable characters.  I never got to see it when it aired on fox. I became a fan after seeing the movie when it was released in theaters.  I would highly recommend theses DVDs to anyone.
0307276902|1.0|Well let's see. It's a lie. He's made millions on lying; Oprah is making millions on calling him a liar . . . after she made millions on telling all of us how wonderful and courageous and inspirational he is.<br /><br />It's all Hollywood. Hollywood takes on  . . . . drug rehab. No. \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" wasn't enough. \\"When a Man loves a woman\\" . . . . not quite. \\"The Lost Weekend\\" . . . .Brrrrr. Old people. So let's let little Jimmy Frey . . . . oh I'm sorry, the self-admitted liar, tell us how he stood up to drugs and alcohol, gosh darnit!<br /><br />Let me tell you something. I haven't had a drink in 14 years. That's a long time but it really is just a series of 24 hour increments. Today was a good day. Yesterday too. Tuesday kind of sucked.<br /><br />And I do it because I have other people I am involved with. To remind me. Who need my help. Whose help I need.<br /><br />And in that 21 year trip, the first seven years missing, slipping and sliding, making mistakes, thinking I could beat alcohol, I never met anyone who stood up to the bottle or to the coke or to the weed, one on one, and won. And I never met anyone who knew of anybody who stood up to the bottle or to the coke or to the weed, one on one, and won.<br /><br />And anyone who tells you they did, is a liar. But maybe you're beginning to suspect that. I hate liars. They steal from us.  Larry Scantlebury
B000002KBD|5.0|This is Van Morrisons best album in my opinion, and to my knowledge, his least popular (of his old stuff). This album even contains \\"Domino\\" which is on just about every best of album he has. A great bled of slow and upbeat songs that (to me) has better tracks than \\"Moondance\\" and \\"Tupelo Honey\\" (which are my other favorites). All in all, a great album from an incredibly undercredited musician.
B00004RIV4|5.0|I'll keeep it short. If for no  other reason (even though there are plenty, believe me) buy this cd for \\"It's Nothing\\" (stunning, haunting, you will be floored!) and \\"Being is Bewildering\\" (I'll let it speak for itself). What kind of music do Moloko make?  Mark Brydon was once forced into saying it's \\"a kind of amalgamation of punk and disco\\".  If you ask me, I'll say they make music for people with hearts, minds, and souls.
0307276902|2.0|The book was a good read but I would not say that the writer is the best literary author in the world.  The story itself was full of horrors with an eclectic mixture of drugs, alcohol, crimes, and horrors of someone who is under the influence of God knows what.  It entertains and provokes the mind to imagine the scenes on the book at the same time.  However, it lacks the substance because if a book claims to be a memoir, should not it stick to the truth and nothing but the truth?  If the writer embellish just to make his story so much more dramatic and make himself sound tougher/stronger, then it should not be called a memoir.  It should be a novel, regardless if he claims to be a drug addict/dealer and whatnot.  In the end, to me, he's just another person who have done tons of bad things to himself and others and managed to make millions of dollars out of it!  How many more authors will milk our society of its precious money because of their \\"embellishment\\" and \\"pathetic\\" stories?  This for sure won't be the last one.
B0000024K1|5.0|Chuck D has the greatest rap voice ever.  Yeah, yeah, there you are with your Snoop Dogg and your Rakim and your Ice Cube and - shut up.  The angry, politically conscious baritone rules the day in the end.  And I'm not even rap's biggest fan. <br /> <br />We have masterful six-minute epics (\\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\", the disks' greatest song, with its incredible, impassioned Chuck D rap over that kickass tinkly piano sample interspersed with martial-sounding distorted Flavor Flav interludes), intense jolts of energy (\\"Bring The Noise\\", \\"She Watch Channel Zero\\" with it's SLAYER sample!!), slower and funkier things (\\"Louder Than A Bomb\\", which actually isn't as loud as some other songs on here, \\"Don't Believe The Hype\\", \\"Party For Your Right To Fight\\"), sampling genius (\\"Terminator X To The Edge Of Panic\\", \\"Caught, Can We Get A Witness?\\", and \\"Night Of The Living Baseheads\\"), cool little one-minute mostly instrumental linking bits (\\"Countdown To Armageddon\\", \\"Mind Terrorist\\", \\"Show 'Em Whatcha Got\\", \\"Security Of The First World\\") and... err.... everything else, including a Flavor Flav solo track (\\"Cold Lampin With Flavor\\") that actually kinda sucks, mainly because of how bowel-suckingly awful the lyrics are (yes, Flav, we get it.  Your name is 'flavor' and bad food puns can be made from this. Fine.  Good.  Say, when's Chuck coming back with the angriness and the politics and the baritone?). <br /> <br />But overall, the dense samples courtesy of the Bomb Squad, Terminator X's expertly placed scratchings and squeakings, Flav's brief snippets (despite \\"Cold Lampin With Flavor\\") and the total kickassedness that is Chuck D will leave you breathless.  And \\"Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\\"  is just SO good.  So, so good.
0307276902|3.0|First, I had to cover the book cover because it was  DISGUSTING!  The story itself is nothing new.  Many, many, many people have this same story and it's been told many times.  Grant it, Mr. Frey has a good editor and brought interest to the book.  However, for Oprah to come so against the man's integrity like she did, she kept uplifting the book as a \\"fantastic\\" book.  That told me that she was still trying to help the man and publishing house with sales in spite of her negative comments to cover herself.  Most of Oprah's book selections are boring, stupid and dull.  Even her movies are terrible (Their Eyes Were Watching God, Beloved, etc.).  I definitely don't want to see her stage production of The Color Purple--too afraid she would damage the completeness and virtue of the film. Oprah does not have an eye for good books or movies. I'm not trying to bash the woman, I just think that she's full of it--trying to please too many people. So what the man wrote a memoir and embellished it.  ALL books have fiction in them.  There is not a book out there, biographical, autobiographical or memoir that has the absolute, this is the way it happened, truth!
B00005NGAL|4.0|My message is to the hearing impaired.  I paid top dollar for this because it stated \\"closed caption\\".  The movie is not closed captioned, only the bonus material.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|In this recent cd, Madeline Peyroux defines herself more as a stylish singer,handling material with consistent emotional color.Her cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance me to the end of love\\" gives a romantic womanly cynical twist in contrast to Cohens' dry stark version.<br />Most hear the echoes of Billie Holiday in her rose-colored vowels and her dark-chocolate  intonations. She has a folk-inspired jazz sensibility that seems to fill a void in the current jazz-vocal scene that is  unimaginative.<br />Madeline does a sultry performance, encouraging a following that appreciate mature depth in contemporary female vocals.Her style has several influences and is difficult to peg down.<br /> Ironically the 'real\\" person doesn't go for all the hoopla,and runs literally away from her success.She spent years as a street singer in Paris,which is why her sound is so sincere and at home in itself.Her music has almost a folksy  jug- band quality at times.Her influences are Parisian ,New Orleans etc.<br />At first listen I couldn't dismiss the \\"Holiday\\" influence dominating her sound,but time did ammend this.I now listen to her without the nagging ghost of \\"Billie\\". I am hearing Madeline.
B00006DEF9|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE TWO DISC DVD NOT THE SINGLE DISC AS AMAZON TENDS TO MIX REVIEWS FOR BOTH EDITIONS. <br /> <br />Arthur Freed started his career at MGM as a songwriter with Herb \\"Nacio\\" Brown.  Then, he became one of MGM's most respected movie musical producers, the famous Freed unit.   <br /> <br />MGM decided to pay tribute to Freed by creating a movie around the songs that he wrote.  This became Singin' in the Rain.  Additionally as most of the songs were written for early movie musicals, therefore, the film is set in Hollywood at the advent of sound. <br /> <br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the stars of Monumental Pictures.  Lena believes that Don and she are a personal couple besides an onscreen couple.  On the way to the premiere party for his latest film with Lena, Don meets movie star wannabe Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).  It's love at first sight but Cathy doesn't want to admit it. <br /> <br />But Don has bigger problems.  Talkies are coming.  Production is shut down on his current film while it is rewritten for talkies.  Don and Lena go into training for talkies.  Don takes to it perfectly, unfortunately Lena's voice is like nails on a chalkboard. <br /> <br />Don tracks down Cathy and after a long night of commiserating with Don's best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), the team come up with an idea on how to save the movie.  Lena will lip sync to Cathy's voice. <br /> <br />All goes well at the movie premiere but Lena is blackmailing the studio to use Cathy as her voice in all her films.  In the end, Lena is her own worst enemy.  Cathy and Don live happily ever after on and off the screen. <br /> <br />This is a light piece of fluff that perfectly captured the early days of Hollywood.  Broadway librettists Betty Comden and Aldoph Green wrote the screenplay.  Having a team that understands book musicals and movie musicals helped with creating the films authentic flavor.  And having film veteran director Stanley Donenpaired with star Kelly as co directors works extremely well and adds depth.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor by this time were film veterans.  While for Debbie Reynolds this was her first musical and she actually proved to up to the veterans. <br /> <br />The big movie within the movie production number is a classic re-teaming Kelly and Cyd Charisse. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />Disc One - <br />Commentary by Debbie Reynolds with Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Kathleen Freeman, Stanley Donen, Betty Comden, Adloph Green, Baz Luhrman and film historian Rudy Behlmer. <br /> <br />Singin' Inspirations - Seven additional sequences from other films or newsreels are referenced into the film.  A green movie reel appears and this shows the footage. These range from 2 to 6 minutes in length. <br /> <br />Disc Two - <br />Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM - An 1:26 PBS/BBC documentary about how Arthur Freed changed the look of the movie musical featuring interviews with Cyd Charisse, Stanley Donen, Andre Previn, Comden & Green, Michael Kidd, Mickey Rooney and others <br /> <br />What a Glorious Feeling - A 35 making of featurette hosted by Debbie Reynolds with interviews or excerpts by Comden & Green, Cyd Charisse, Stanley Donen, Kathleen Freeman and Donald O'Connor <br /> <br />Excerpts from Features Where the Songs Originated - 12 songs are featured here with the original movie they were written for including Singing in the Rain <br /> <br />You are My Lucky Star Outtake - a four minute version with Debbie Reynolds singing the song to a billboard of Don <br /> <br />Scoring Stage Sessions - This is 26 alternate takes of songs.  This is the song only.  Songs were recorded first and then lip synced as filmed. <br />
B000003N7K|5.0|The fact that Coltrane believed Hartman to be the perfect Jazz singer,and the fluidity of this production,sets a standard for standard interpretations.<br />Johnny has never been better showcased,and he blends seamlessly with Coltrane.<br />\\"Lush Life\\" is the best version ever,as it haunts and pulls the listener into it's atmosphere.It is a classic teamimg,and there is no greater pairing in this idiom.Hartman does what few male vocalist accomplish,(perfect tonality,phrasing)and Coltrane lovingly supports him, however artistically is 50 percent of the mix.
B000B7HZXM|4.0|No, this is not Rockin' Rod but he proves that he is still can sell a song...even if it's an oldie.  Rod doesn't have to just sing one style of music...he does justice to these tunes from the past. I just love this album of familiar great American songs that have sensational melodies and clever lyrics.   It's sung with verve and Rod's in great voice!  I especially loved Elton John singing a duet with Rod on \\"Making Whoopee\\".  I have volume 1 and 4 and look forward to buying the others.
B000002J09|5.0|Yes, this is a classic album. This my favorite LZ album together with 'Physical Grafitti' and one of the best classic rock albums. You say overrated? Well, maybe. It's not the greatest record ever (no, don't think I'm like that retard Cincinnati Bengals #1 Fann, I hate Korn, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit and almost everything is on MTV), but it's still amazing and it's good enough to get 5 stars from me. Plant's vocals are in top notch here. The drums, bass are great and it has some very complex riffs and solos. Here I'll go through the songs...    Black Dog (10/10): A classic, very good vocals and solos. Not much need to be said about it that hasn't been said yet.    Rock & Roll (20/10): Personal favorite on the album, the riffs aren't very complex but this is the catchiest song here and also has the best vocals here, IMO.    The Battle Of Evermore (10/10): A great ballad, I find it somewhat underrated and overlooked. The riffing is perfect here.    Stairway To Heaven (11/10): Overplayed? Maybe. Overrated? Perhaps. Kick ass? YES!!    Misty Mountain Hop (7/10): It's not perfect, but it's not that bad. The vocals in the verses are weak but it has some baddass riffs that saves this track from sucking big time.    Four Sticks (9/10): Another great track, the riffs in the verse are bit repetetive but it still rocks!    Going to California (10/10): Another great ballad which is also underrated. It's acoustic all the way but there's no one single moment boring of it.    When The Levee Breaks (10/10): Fantastic way to close the album. The solos are some of the best Page ever made and it has also cool basslines.    There you have it. It's Zepp's best album (along with 'Grafitti'), it may be somewhat overrated but it rocks all the way. If you are a classic rock fan (or rock music in general) and don't have this, get this now!
0307276902|5.0|Make sure that you read this book from cover to cover.  It is amazing! <br /> <br />James wrote a memoir, not an autobiography. In my opinion that cuts him some slack to change it up. The book is wonderful and for someone that struggles with the same issues it has helped me allot. James has issues  he has listed many of them. You can't expect him to have the self-control and maturity to keep the story completely authentic.  <br /> <br />If you read the story and thought that he was really that much of a bad boy and people really backed down to him that much you are a fool. This is his point of view of what happened and I thought that anyone reading the book would realize that. It was a great STORY.  <br /> <br />All the money hungry lawyers should go back to chasing ambulances. If you want to change the category that the book is in do so. Then get over it.
0553801503|5.0|I've been waiting so long for this book and although it was enjoyable I feel cheated...where IS everone?  This reads like half an effort by GRR Martin and I get the feeling a couple hundred pages were left in a drawer.  I'll wait for book five, of course, but I hope I don't get stood up again. Heavy sigh.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I think in order to understand this movie better you need to be from some sort of military background. My boyfriend saw this movie and said that most of it is accurate to how he spent his days in boot camp. In order to understand it better it would probably be best to read the book itself. The only problem is now-a-days most people would not take the time out to read the book. <br /> <br />The whole point of this movie is NOT to take a side on the war. There is no opinion on it in this movie. It basically just shows what it is like to be in the military and how they feel when they themselves are waiting around for something to happen.
B00000GBHA|5.0|I was in the Peace Corps in Malawi in the mid-90s, was hitching through Mozambique with a couple of other volunteers in the spring of '95, just after the war.  The only other \\"mzungus\\" we saw the whole time there was this South African couple we met in a restuarant in Nampula who invited us to stay at their house on the beach.  They were working there to rebuild the roads and put on this album while we were hanging out that night.  It floored me immediately. <br /> <br />I asked who it was and the guy looked at me oddly and said \\"Rodriguez, he's AMERICAN\\" as if he thought I was a nutter for never having heard of the guy.  And he was right.  The next time I was in SA for holiday I snapped it right up.   <br /> <br />Listening to it right now.  If he tours here I would go in a heart beat.  His songs definitely have a Dylan quality to them as many have mentioned, but his voice reminds me a Jim Croche.  You won't regret buying this album. <br /> <br />I am now a SAHM, living in the 'burbs, my 1.5 year son is playing with the CD cover right now.  My how times change, but when I put on this album I am a wandering 20something, saving the world and hitchhiking through southern africa, where ever the ride takes us.  I am RIGHT THERE. <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|It's such a sad state when millions of people look up to a pillar and listen to a fool speaking.  Such a thing happened back during the Salem Witch Trials.  A town friar says because a woman skips menstruation, she be a witch, something laughable like the Monty Python parodies.<br /><br />Fools use melted wax to seal things closed as their stamp of approval, may such a stamp be unbroken.  Sometimes fools put a sticker on a book, call it a book club, and the denizons below read it now as gospel.  Not unlike the mob that carries torches to light the way up the witches path.<br /><br />But wait!  Other voices say it's bunk!  The preacher roundabouts but will the school of fish follow?  Of course.  The work of art in question is now invalid.  Forgotten?  Or just the whole thing pathetic?<br /><br />Oh Monty Python.  Where are you?<br /><br />Dave Chappelle.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|That is the only thing I can think of that would justify canceling this excellent series.  I, like many others who reviewed this DVD set, did not catch \\"Firefly\\" on TV.  Nor did I catch \\"Serenity\\" in the theaters.  I rented \\"Serenity\\" after seeing it reviewed favorably over and over.  I stuck it on my Netflix list and forgot about it.  Then the movie arrived and I watched it.  I LOVED it and watched it again.  I just had to buy my own copy and also picked up the boxed set of the series.  What a sci-fi treasure this show was!  Who in their right mind at FOX let this one go? (Then again, these are the same folks who canceled \\"Arrested Development.\\")  The shows will haunt you, as will the theme song.  I'm not a fan of network shows, generally speaking, but this one has gotten under my skin and I just love it.  It deserved a long run.  I sincerely hope that someone with an eye for quality and originality will pick this show up and we, the fans of \\"Firefly,\\" will get to see Joss Whedon's vision play out.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Like fellow Las Vegas natives The Killers, Panic! Are a young band with an appreciation for `80s synth-pop. Unlike Brandon Flowers and co however, they chose to tribute a song on their debut album to the charms of their home town, \\"When I say shotgun, you say wedding!\\". They also conveniently straddle a number of genres, it is not quite definitive enough to call them emo, pop-punk or new wave guitar pop. Drawing on Fall Out Boy's knack for a clever, melodious vocal styling, Panic! inject distinctly processed dance beats, adding their own twist. This works most effectively on the pulsating opener The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage (they are also well-schooled in the use of mildly-ironic, overlong song titles). Lying Is The Most Fun... is the spurned lovers' ode that Blink 182 never quite managed to master in their post-nakedness stage, while I Write Sins, Not Tragedies trumps it with heavy synth action and the album's most infectious, indeed feverish chorus. <br />Lyricist Ryan Ross manages to take swipes at a number of targets, but delivered with a smile, the sort of clever protest that escapes the likes of Green Day and Anti Flag. The only earnest element of the album is the constant compulsion to dance, even if the beats miss the mark occasionally. Besides, you have to admire a band as young as Panic! that can pull off a lyric as knowing as \\"We're just a wet dream for the webzine\\".
B00004YYWI|5.0|This is a really good melodic piece of work, opeth has a lot of catchy riffs, bass lines, and beats in this one. Too many people ignore Orchid and Morningrise but they are great albums produced and probably influenced by Dan Swano. On a side note it was good to see Mikael and Dan team up on the first two Bloodbath albums, check them out if you are looking for some metal to add to your collection.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|Timing is everything in the music world. Five short years ago The Strokes unleashed their debut Is This It on the world, paving the way for a slew of acts, across both sides of the Atlantic, to follow in their wake. Channelling influences from the Velvet Underground to Television, Is This It reinvigorated the indie scene with conscious nods to yesteryear, but its heart was in the future. Follow-up Room On Fire was a hastily-released consolidation of ground, narrow in focus but effortless in its precision. However, there is a growing feeling that when the movie of the guitar-band resurgence surfaces, its torch bearing leading men may be written out early. The Strokes however have other plans. <br />First Impressions of Earth arrives with subtle but noticeable changes apparent. Firstly the band have replaced the producer of the previous two albums, Gordon Raphael, with David Kahne, a creative shift aiming to instigate a \\"beefier\\" sound, with more staying power. The dour-titled opener You Only Live Once encapsulates all that made the other two albums so great: insistent, jangly guitars, a powerful rhythmic shift to the chorus and Julian Casablancas' unmistakeable voice. It is, however, a false dawn for anyone expecting a replication of their past glories. With a running time close to double that of their previous efforts, The Strokes are laying their claim to a contingency plan. Razorblade apes Barry Manilow's Mandy unashamedly, showing a confidence befitting a band of their status, while lusty throwaway single Juicebox is their crack at composing a heavy-riffed juggernaut. <br />Increasingly, Casablancas' lyrics belie a world-weariness particularly on the down-tempo Ask Me Anything (central lyric: \\"I've got nothing to say\\") and On The Other Side. Crucially though, there is an unmistakeable step-up in his song-writing prowess, in line with the swelling musical creativity framing the lyrics. First Impressions... reveals its charms slowly and is an album which will reward repeated listens. Electricityscape and Vision of Division probe new proggy areas, while 15 Minutes sounds as though it was composed during a quiet night out with Shane MacGowan. <br />Ultimately, First Impressions... is slightly over-long, indulgent and great. While never likely to be an album as important as Is This It, it suggests The Strokes are in it for the long haul and we should be thankful for that.       <br />
0307276902|1.0|I was about half way through this book when I began hearing all of the \\"hoopla\\" surrounding it.  At first, I was not all that interested.  Then, after watching Oprah, I fully began to understand the gravity of the situation.  Like Oprah and millions of other readers, I became really invested in Frey and his tales of addiction.  I wanted to read this book and find out what happens...not to some fictionalized character but to James Frey, the person.  If I wanted to read a fictionalized account of addiction and rehab., I would have.  This was put out as a memoir and thus, should have some semblance of authenticity.  It's one thing to change a few minor details to protect people, but it's another rhelm of literature all together to fabricate a story (it's called fiction).  I think this is just another fine example of the dumbing down of America.  We were duped again. <br />In the end, I thrrew the book away - disguisted.
B000059TPN|4.0|This review is for the Criterion Collection edition - and to counter the review that says it's a great movie on an awful DVD.  The movie is certainly entertaining, but far from a masterpiece of filmmaking.  The Criterion DVD is outstanding, as is to be expected.  And it's a two-disc set.  I'm guessing that the reviewer who hated the DVD has the inferior studio release and not the Criterion DVD.  The question remains as to why Criterion would choose this title, but the movie does have its admirers.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book right after Oprah made it her book club recommendation.  James Frey had not been on her show yet (the 1st time). After reading the book, I found out that he would be on Oprah and I could not wait to see the show.  I called my brother who is in recovery and made sure he was aware that the show was on and to watch it.  Then the bomb hit!  I was so angry for having thought that so many people would be helped by this book.  Now we find out most of it is a lie.  I am absolutely disgusted with James Frey.  I would not read another book of his if someone paid me to.  As far as I am concerned, James Frey is nothing better than an insect sucking the blood and money out of the American public.  He ought to go away forever.
0307276902|1.0|Well, when I first read this book I, like most people, was blown away by it's candor and story.  Needless to say, now that the \\"truth\\" has come out, I am sadly disappointed.  To know that an author called a book a memoir and knowingly lied about integral parts of the book makes me disgusted.  Part of the intrigue about this book was the unbelievable journey that Mr. Frey went on to effect his recovery and now we find that most of it just isn't true.  His \\"embellishments\\" as he calls them are just outright lies, furthermore, there seems to be no reason to do what he did.  Why not be truthfull about how Lilly ended her life.  Why would you say you were in jail when you weren't, why develop that whole engrossing passage about visiting the dentist and not being able to have novacain?  In my book, he's just a good liar.  I won't be wasting my money on his publications simply because there are so many better and more trustworthy authors out there.  Smoking gun was right when they pegged him as just a preppy from a rich family who never really had to answer for his discretions, because he certainly doesn't seem remorseful (on Oprah) for having fooled the American Public.
0307276902|4.0|I think that this is a very powerful book.  A testimonial to that statement is that the book has stirred up a great deal of controversy.  If it were a lousy book, no one would even care. <br />When I read the book, my concern was not the veracity of the book, but I did have the concern that addicted individuals would be able to deny seeking professional help when that is so important for a complete recovery.  A lot of times, the addictive personality rationalizes and says that they don't need help to maintain their newly found addictive free lifestyle, but that is usually not true.  They need the help of objective professionals who can assist them in their recovery!
0060555661|5.0|Despite the fact that I'm a uni student, finding a good book on investing was harder than I'd expected. After browsing around, I found out about this book on the internet, about how Warren Buffet, the 2nd richest person in the world, read this book in his early years. That plus all the great reviews on Amazon made this a must buy for me, despite its fairly high price (costed me over AU $50 at dymocks).<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed & found my money's worth. This latest updated 623-page paperback version is definitely a classic. The original chapters are intact and includes footnotes from Zweig. He provides his own commentary on each chapter contents in a separate chapter following each original chapter. These are really helpful as he makes each principle interesting & relevant by using recent examples which illustrate the principles at work
B00011RPB0|5.0|A great movie. The plot is...not much of anything, but the plot isn't the centerfold of this movie. Really this movie is about ideas, and relationships. An excellent movie with an excellent message.
B000002KIT|5.0|Lizzy is what every band wishes they could be. L&D is an amazing live show. But, it cannot encompas Philip and the Boy's careers. Black Rose, Chinatown, and Thunder and Lightning, all come after L&D, and illustrate the direction in which Lizzy was heading. T&L is one of their best albums. Sadly, Phil left us all that faithul day, but his spirit lives on in all of us. God Bless you Philip Lynott.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Everwood desrves 50 stars as having the finest writing, characterization, acting, and directing of any dramatic YV series in history! It is a terrible tragedy the ineptness of the WB \\"network\\" has caused this series to not survive to season 5 and beyond. WHEN IN THE WORLD WILL SEASONS 2, 3 AND 4 BECOME AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE ON DVD? WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE ANSWER ME? Buy season 1, everybody---you will never regret it! Maybe with a spike in sales for season 1 we'll see the rest on DVD too. This series is far too good to pass up!!!

006072448X|5.0|Are kids born bad, or do parents have a hand in creating a child capable of disturbing actions?  This book is an excellent exploration of this topic viewed through the eyes of a parent.  I knew nothing about the book before I read it and enjoyed it thoroughly (and probably more) as a result.  I recommend that if the topic interests you, don't read a detailed review - it will rob you of some of the experience.
B00005JOIF|1.0|I can see why Mossad broke cover and took part in two post-Munich documentaries, the second of which I watched the night before seeing 'Munich'. Professional pride was at stake after the angst ridden, Keystone Cops portrayal given here. Not saying Mossad's rebuttal should be taken as gospel and Spielberg 'trusts his sources' apparently. However, I'm not convinced by his film.  <br /> <br />In the documentary, the elevator assassins ask their target for his name and shoot him quickly using silencers. In 'Munich', they come across as bumbling amateurs. Another agent shows up after they've departed to look for shell casings, inexplicably exposing himself to possible arrest through his enigmatically slow lingering. But hey, doesn't enigmatically slow lingering look cinematic? The team doesn't hire an explosives expert, that would be too vulgar a display of professional competence. They take his word for it instead. No checking of backgrounds in Mossad it appears. This elite team will foolishly run back into a building to salvage a botched job rather than walk away. Curiously, the writer chooses to ignores facts about the Beruit raid concerning the loss of the element of surprise. Instead, he prefers to make up no end of far fetched mistakes. <br /> <br />'Munich' smacks of a writer constantly puting his own sentiments into the mouths of people least likely to have expressed such reservations. The most a real life Mossad assassin would admit to in the documentary is deliberatly avoiding sentimentality by not seeing his gun-downed target as a family man. Instead, he concentrated on his orders and trusted his bosses judgement implicitly. In a scene of stunning crassness in 'Munich', the paranoid lead agent strips his room looking for Israeli type assassination tactics and then goes to hide in his closet just as he had been told his enemy had been driven to. But why does he think tactics unique to Israeli intelligence would be used against him? Do I smell agenda? But to make sure we really get it, team Spielberg has the agent look like an x-ray during debriefing back in Israel. He's a ghost, get it. Haunting himself because of what the state has made him do. No wonder the real life Israeli intelligence community is feeling more than a little miffed.  <br /> <br />The Americans don't come out of the picture smelling of roses either, surprise, surprise. In the documentary I saw, the CIA opperative who handled a key PLO leader Mossad wanted to assassinate over Munich at least expressed sentiments sympathetic to the Israeli position. In the film, the CIA are portrayed as positely anti-Semitic, giving the Mossad team the proverbial one fingered salute. <br /> <br />I noticed that the writer had the Munich atheletes fight back against the terrorists, one even bravely climbing back into the window to tackle the bad guys single handedly with a knife versus assault rifles. Wishful thinking as an answer to events in World War Two? Or is the writer suggesting that the individual is entitled to fight back, but state sponsored assassination is a no-no? The message I took from the final scene was that Israel is a false construct that will turn Jew against Jew, a scurrilous piece of anti-Zionist muck raking that no doubt will find its constituency. <br /> <br />Why not keep to the facts? The real life botched killing of an innocent man that ended with the incarceration of a Mossad hit squad should have said plenty about the evils of violating international law. Instead we are offered indigestible hand ringing platitudes unconvincingly delivered by all and sundry. <br /> <br />Technically, I wish Spielberg would dump this cinematographer he seems to be using of late. Gloomy bluey grey washed out vistas with ghosting, especially against light sources. Enough. <br /> <br />Sorry, Steve. I went to bat for you over War of the Worlds, but I can't defend this clunker. Even Oliver Stone might blanche at this revionist claptrap. <br />
B000AP04L0|4.0|Wonderful movie... I LOVE this movie. However, truth must be told that the \\"flair\\" aspect is seriously lacking in this special edition. Which is a shame because let's face it there are a million things that would be done to \\"flair\\" it up from bottons, to post-its, to almost anything office related. It had special features like deleted scenes... but so many movies have that now that it really isn't all that special. I can't stress enough though that it's a great movie, I just wish the special edition was, well, more special...
B0009R1T7M|1.0|I'm completely astonished by the rave reviews for this album.  Singer-songwriter stuff works best when the artist makes you feel he's singing about experiences or events that have greatly affected him.  These dilettantish songs, on the other hand, sound totally forced, like they're based on encyclopedia entries (Or am I to believe that Stevens has strong personal feelings about Casimir Pulaski, Mary Todd Lincoln, Carl Sandburg, and the Columbian Exposition?).     The lame lyrics could be somewhat forgiven if the music had a pulse, but this album is totally D.O.A -- no energy whatsoever, melodies that are completely innocuous and instantly forgettable.    As for the song about John Wayne Gacy, Stevens is seemingly trying to be profound but in the end has nothing remotely insightful to say (Serial killers are people too?  Wow, how heavy!!!!).
7119005901|5.0|The title of this review truly says it all for this martial epic. One would not make an overstatement by comparing this bbok to such powerful works of literature as the iliad or the nibelung.Everything from characters to plot is richly portrayed.Characters are epic and complex and he storyline is iaginative and rich. The only chinese novel that cann supposedly surpass this book is The Dream of the red chamber and I can't wait to read it
1400031087|4.0|This is a riveting story.  I found the memoir to be heartwrenching and inspirational.  I don't really care if James Frey exaggerated or changed some of the details.  I don't expect a memoir to be 100% accurate, and I would expect any memoir describing addict's personal struggles to have elements changed to protect their identity.   <br /> <br />I look forward to reading My Friend Leonard, and Mr. Frey's future works.   <br /> <br />I also applaud his courage for putting up with Oprah's self-serving interrogation
0812550706|5.0|THE BOOK <br /> <br />I just recently read Ender's Game, and I have got to say it is one of the best pieces of science fiction I've read.  Orson Scott Card initially wrote the book so that he could write its sequal (which I have not yet read) Speaker for the Dead.  Both books received the Hugo award for science fiction -- an unprecedented accomplishment. <br /> <br />Ender's Game is not your typical science fiction focused more cool ideas rather than carefully crafted literature.  Every chapter was carefully and beautifully written, especially the \\"Fantasy Game\\" segments which serve as an effective literary device giving us a sort of poetry of metaphor within the bowels of this piece of science fiction.  And despite the intentionally uber-adult-like qualities in the children, I found Card's characters quite compelling and real. <br /> <br />Not only is the book an enjoyable read, but I found myself inspired by Ender and his relentless determination not to be overcome by the circumstances.  Instead of feeling sorry for himself and whining about injustices, he used his head to make impotent the \\"unfair\\" and overcome the impossible.

0307276902|5.0|I had not read a book in several years but decided this would be the one. Even with the recent controversy around it being real,  this book kept my attention by taking me into the mind of a drug addict. The vivid descriptions of what life had been like and the recovery process was outstanding.
0316172324|1.0|This is a horrible book written to the idiot in everyone, so, naturally it sells like hot cakes.  If you think this man is better at reasoning and theory than Socrates then go ahead and lemer off of a cliff, if you realize that Socratic methods will be more benificial for our society, then support Socratic bassed works rather than this bunk.   <br /> <br />God save humanity....
0307276902|1.0|This prose of this book is horrid and the story is utterly cliche. As such, it was no surprise when it came out that Frey had tried for a long time to publish his book as FICTION.  <br /> <br />It was horrible fiction and the publishers knew it. But then he tried to sell it as a memoir (or publishers coaxed him into doing that) since people are suckers for survival memoirs.  <br /> <br />It is totally despicable that Frey lied. But even if he hadn't, and had published this as fiction, it would still be a bad, bad book.  <br /> <br /> <br />(People interested in a good book on addiction, read Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus' Son\\")
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I have read some reviews of this CD that just rip it to shreds.  I don't undersatnd it.  Find me another band that can get together after 37 years and sound this tight.  These guys are incredible musicians, and we should be very thankful for this great \\"live\\" reunion CD, after all this time.  Quite frankly, I find it incredible, considering how long it has been since they all performed together.  Let's give them their due---5 stars from this old rocker.
0553801503|4.0|I've been waiting for this for a long time...it was worth it.  George is a genius.
0553801503|2.0|Any Martin fan knows that the author doesn't shy away from controversial subjects; themes of incest, treachery, and murder have always played central roles in his Song of Ice and Fire series, just as they did in the real-life British history that serves as inspiration. <br /> <br />However, the overt prurience, mysogeny, and just plain vileness present in this latest tome seems to serve as a literary crutch rather than honest narrative, as they did in the past.  The word \\"rape\\" is present on every other page of the book, with several rapes described in detail, some worthy of any contemporary American sexual predator.  I don't think there is a female in the book that doesn't have her nipples described to us in great detail.  The relative and variant tumescence of his male characters is never far from Martin's pen.  There is an extremely explicit lesbian encounter, and more of what would easily qualify as pedophelia in modern society than you can shake a stick at.   <br /> <br />It's to be understood that Martin is describing the lawless aftermath of a massive civil war, and that atrocities are always present in such circumstances.  He's also illuminating a period of our own history when sexual maturity was considered the measure of one's readiness for intimacy.  However, what is contained in the pages of this book goes far beyond what is required to get these points across and into the territory of lurid, leering, winking, slavering enjoyment of the very act of imagining and describing it. <br /> <br />Martin killed off all but a couple of his first-string heros in earlier volumes.  The second-stringers that are left are far from compelling--an atrociously ugly swordmaiden, a grossly overweight coward, and a twisted reagent, among other previously minor characters, are what are left to us.  Martin wisely focuses the lion's share of his attention on Cersei, and indeed her parts of the book are best, with her growing paranoia and horrible misrule of the kingdom. <br /><br />Martin is also not afraid to dispense of his main characters in his usual graphic way.  In the last pages of the book, one character's cheek is bitten off before they are hanged to death, for example.   <br /> <br />In the end, Martin's unfocused, million-direction narrative, the fact that his characters spend the first 200 pages of the book sitting around and talking, the unsatisfyingly slow plot development, and the horrifyingly vile narrative sink this book well below his previous efforts.  There was a time when Martin was considered by many, including myself, to be the finest contemporary American fantasy author, but that was a long time ago, and that younger, past Martin would no doubt blanch in horror at what he's created this time around.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is Nas at his prime. Nas has that sick rhyming flow and that sick production backing him up making this album flawless. Nas is never the same again after Illmatic but still delivers it hard unlike most rappers (don't worry I'm not looking at you 50 Cent)...50 Cent is a guilty pleasure of mine but he will never be as great as Nas. Nas made NY known once again and had the crown but soon stolen by Notorious BIG. When he died it came back to Nas and HELL NO! it's Jay-Z. Nas, forever my favorite rapper! Recommended to any true hip hop fan and I swear you won't regret this.
B000031WD9|5.0|American Pie is, hands down, the funniest movie I have ever seen. The first time I saw it, I nearly had a heart attack from laughing so hard. Even today, I still crack up at various scenes and soundbites. Of all the films that attempt to portray teenage sexuality, this one comes closest.    Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch are four high school seniors who vow to lose their virginity by prom night or face eternal embarrassment for entering college without ever getting laid. Each takes a distinct approach to attaining this ultimate goal: Jim sets his sights on a sexy exchange student, Kevin tries to up the ante with his girlfriend, Oz works on his softer side, and Finch relies on the rumor mill. Stiffler, an obnoxious party animal, provides motivation is a rather annoying way, while Jim's dad is ripe with coming-of-age advice.    The acting in American Pie is very well done, but what makes this film truly great is its comedy. There are several downright hilarious scenes (the most memorable of which involves an apple pie), and the different personalities of the male and female characters flow together nicely in the film. There are also many funny quotes in the movie that are not suitable to be posted here...many of which are provided by Stiffler (who has quite a talent using the F-word).    American Pie is a very accurate depiction of high school life, but be warned...this is NOT a film for kids! The movie is extremely funny, but its humor is strictly of an adult nature.    The DVD has some nice bonus features, including a documentary on the behind-the-scenes production of the film. If you haven't seen American Pie before, I guarantee you will fall off your seat laughing.
B0000019PA|5.0|To some people this album becomes all the music you want to listen to. Some of these people will stop with ITAOTS after giving On Avery Island a listen and finding it not to their liking. The few who like On Avery Island will find themselves trapped in a whirlpool of Jeff Mangum. No matter how much you like the Arcade Fire, or The Decemberists, you will never like them as much as you love Neutral Milk Hotel. This band will become that ex girlfriend that your current girlfriend hates you talking about. You will find yourself wishing you had never brought her home that one lonely September night, just so you wouldnt know the sweet taste that she brought to your lips. These thought will be followed by the dumping of your current girlfriend, running over to Milky's house in the rain and pleading for her to take you back. Like she has done countless times before, she will take you inside and light the fireplace and tell you that everything will be ok. I guess I am one of these people.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|OK so to start off I am a female & I LOVED Hostel.  I've seen it twice already & I'm probably going to take my bf this time.  Even though the first half is like a soft core porno it shouldnt take anything away from the movie... the first half didn't bother me at all.  The only thing that bothered me was the guy jerking off behind me the 2nd time I saw this.  The torture scenes I thought were amazing!  I love this movie & I can't wait for it to be put on DVD.  I would've liked more torture scenes in the movie but I thought the ones they had were great! This movie is more like an adventure with the main characters & is not just about torture which is cool. <br /> <br />Even though I loved Saw I preferred Hostel better because I can see that happening more than what happened in SAW... <br /> <br />Don't let Eli Roth's previous movie, Cabin Fever, deter you from seeing Hostel.  they are def two different movies that don't relate.  personally I didn't care too much for Cabin Fever.      <br /> <br />I hope this helps!
0307276902|5.0|I read this book when it first came out and loved it, and I still love it now. Mr. Frey did not ask to be in Oprah's lame club, why in the world should he have to answer to her?? If Miss Winfrey is so worried about \\"truth\\" maybe she should do her own fact checking before she reccommends a book. I mean come on, first she says no big deal and now she is pissed because she got some letters?? I did not neccesarily believe everything I read in the book at the time I read it, but for me that didn't take away from the message the author was trying to get across. OPRAH'S JUST A TALK SHOW HOST FOLKS, NOT GOD. The only thing Oprah has proved to me through all this is a reason to not like HER. Her brow beating him on her show just made me plain ill. Who in the world does she think she is?? I have no doubt that if Oprah did a memoir, she would \\"massage the truth\\" a bit too. Should the book be reclassified as fiction?? Maybe, but who is to say that any other \\"memoir\\" is entirely truthful?? I believe this whole thing was more about her promoting her show than \\"doing the right thing\\"  <br /> <br />I just hope that Mr. Frey is not dissueded from writing another book because of all this. I just read \\"My friend Leanard\\" and loved that too, and will buy whatever book he decides to write in the future. He didn't have to go on her show, but he did, and took all the crap that she gave him for an entire hour. I have more respect for him now than before. I say screw Oprah. He's a great writer.. period.
0307276902|1.0|This book simply put should be titled as non-fiction- it is a disservice to the reader to buy it under memoir, when everyone knows that it's been embellished, altered, fabricated, etc. Furthermore, the writing is horrible!  <br />The most important thing that wasn't addressed is the fact that the book has been plagiarized, it is a carbon copy of the author in Los Angeles that died of a drug overdose. <br />One another reviewer mentioned that earlier- I purchased the book and found it to be true. Even the writing style is copied!
B000002BBY|5.0|The hatred of Oasis has always baffled me.  Sure, they're arrogant, but aren't most rock stars?  I guess Oasis broke the one rock star taboo left by saying they were bigger than the Beatles.  Remember when John Lennon said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus?  If rock n roll in part is about pissing people off who take themselves too seriously, then I guess Oasis have fulfilled that bit of the bargain. <br /> <br />Regarding their influences-- anyone who has ever seriously listened to Oasis knows that they are not simply Beatles' clones.  Sometimes they sound like the Beatles (as does every other band of the past 40 years).  They also at times sound like the Sex Pistols, the Stones, T. Rex, the Kinks, and about 20 other bands of varying obscurity.   <br /> <br />The more you listen to popular music, the more you realize that there really hasn't been much progress from Elvis except more distortion and grittier vocal styles.  So if you think Oasis sounds like XXXX band plus more distortion and grittier vocals--then congratulations, you're beginning to understand music history. <br /> <br />With respect to the album itself, any objective observer would admit that Oasis pretty much nailed a perfect rock album here.  Unlike a lot of the albums from the era, there is nothing faddish about the sound that makes it sound dated ten years later.  Every single song on this album is solid, and they all fit together.   <br /> <br />The bottom line is that if you just listen to this music and stop thinking about how all of your music-geek friends hated Oasis in 1995-97, then you will probably really love this.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've never been the biggest System of a Down fan, not necessarily because I didn't enjoy their music but because I simply didn't pay attention. If you judge them on the surface, it's easy to dismiss SOAD as just another widget on the assembly line, that kind of laughable, proto-primal faux metal that gets churned out alongside such underwhelming luminaries as Papa Roach and Staind. But upon scratching the surface, I was shocked. I was stunned. System of a Down are, quite simply, one of the most important bands of the last twenty years, and are without question the most thought-provoking and genre-bending band out there right now. Until Tool releases their new album, System assume the throne, in my mind, as the best metal band in the world. Now, having said that, I think it's important to emphasize the fact that coming to this conclusion was not an instant revelation for me, as I've said that I never really paid much attention before. But when BYOB hit radios early last year, I stopped to take a second look. It was brilliant. The phrasing, the stop-start rhythm, the deceptive party-anthem-on-acid feel of the bridge erupting into the chorus. It was clear to me that this band was on a completely different trip than anything else that was going on in music, metal or otherwise, so I picked up the album on impulse. What followed was a listening sensation comparable only to hearing a heavier, more politically-conscious Mothers of Invention. Indeed, one can see the irreverent/brilliant influence Mr. Zappa has had on tracks like Cigaro, when the chorus strips away to a chuckle-worthy harmony of \\"Can't you see that I love my ****?\\" The exorcism of insanity and hatred is tempered on Mezmerize, as always, by gorgeous harmonies and articulate guitar work, apparent in songs like Question!, Lost in Hollywood, and Sad Statue, the latter featuring one of the most poignant statements of America's current polical situation with \\"You and me will all go down in history with a sad Statueof Liberty and a generation that didn't agree.\\" Mezmerize is one hell of an atomic bomb of an album to drop on slack-jawed, disillusioned middle America, and the fact that it's just one half of a giant whole is even cooler. If anyone was wondering what the future of metal sounded like, this is the prototype.
B000001EG6|5.0|This album was EJ's introduction to American fans as EMPTY SKY did not see a US release till much later.Better known as the BLACK ALBUM,it contains ten great songs that best showcase what Elton & Bernie had to offer us back in 1970.Starting with Elton' signature tune YOUR SONG,you journey through ballads such as I NEED YOU TO TURN TO and THE GREATEST DISCOVERY,the existentially tinged SIXTY YEARS ON and dance tracks such as THE CAGE and the FM and concert mainstay TAKE ME TO THE PILOT.BORDER SONG ,already covered by Aretha Frankling & Jose Feliciano left much to speculate as the album's protest song.Overall,this work heralded the beginning of a new era in pop music craftsmanship and hence the birth of one of rock's greatest stars.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|The reviewer that claims \\"she\\" is female is most likely an adolescent male, but whatever the gender, the review reveals a definite adolescent mentality.  I know one female that enjoyed this movie and thought it quite disturbing.  The fact that you have subhuman pieces of trash that literally are deriving an erotic thrill out of this movie speaks volumes of the moral decay and corruption of values in our society.  I seriously hope that Eli Roth meets with a violent, tragic end, as that fate is the only thing he is worthy of achieving in his pathetic, poor excuse of a life.   <br /> <br />From a less visceral and more analytic criticism of the movie, the fact that it was number one in the opening week of the first of the year was due to heavy commerical advertising and the fact that it was essentially the only new release, coming on the heels of movies that were in theatres for several weeks, such as Munich, Narnia, and King Kong.  The fact that it quickly shunk after that first week shows that word of mouth anulled the heavy hype and it's \\"success\\" was due to only a lack of choice by bored holiday movie goers having most likely seen the other major hits of the previous year. <br /> <br />The movie lacked any depth or story plot other than a very course grain think veiled attempt at narration, which proved more excuse for simplistic gratuitous puerile mindless sex scenes, spanning nearly 40 mintues of the first part of the moive, followed suddenly by a dramatic shift of scenes of torture and murder with an emphasis on extreme gore and excessive blood sheeding.   <br /> <br />The movie's sole goal is to disgust audience members via scene of a gagged man vomiting while being cut with a chain saw' a woman having her toes chopped off, one by one; another scene where a woman's face is scorched with a blow torch; another scene were a woman's eye is dislodged from her socket, shown hanging down, over her face, and then sliced off, close-ups of it gushing all over her.  Thisis Eli Roth's retarded notion of \\"creativity\\" and \\"entertainment,\\" where once again the only minds that could derive any sense of enjoyment are those with all the asethetic sensibilities of one that finds horse manure of deep, artistic significance, worthy to be praised and giving great visual pleasure to view. <br /> <br />For the rest of us with an IQ above 80 and no longer cracking a goofy smile when the word \\"annulus,\\" say, is mentioned this movie was just awlful and painful to sit through.  Indeed, the only thing more grotesque than the gore on the silver screen was the lack of acting and story telling and the horrific, embarrassing attempt by Mr. Roth to try to do justice to both those considerations. <br /> <br />If cheap sex scenes by artificial looking women and blood get you off, go rent a cheap porno flick and watch a cable documentary on slaughter houses.  It would most likely be a much more entertaining evening. <br /> <br />Eli Roth, however, only reveals his warped view of women, sex, and his projected, fixated fears of sex and death and a most sad adolescent state of arrested mental development.  Truly, he is destined to be a third rate hack, following on the heels of a Tarantino, where Eli Roth's \\"greatest accomplishment\\" will be this embarrassment of a stupid film.
0385507755|1.0|Readers know the deal with fiction, they take it for what it says, how it reads, enjoying the ride. It may, or may not, have anything true to say. That's just a possibility, maybe, you judge for yourself. When it deals with subjects that real people face it's at most a tour, barely an exploration. The problem with James Frey, whose work is listed on Amazon as a recommended book on the experience of abuse, yet now exposed as almost another \\"JT LeRoy\\", is that the writing is shot through with claims of truth, of terrible experiences that maybe verge on what some really might experience, but which he did not. Experiences which top, and distort those that real kids of the past and present, and too likely the future, suffer, effectively silencing them. Silencing people whose stories need to be heard, believed, and to lead to change. Thus the writing has that fatal difference, instead of being a tour, it is colonialisation, ignoring the boundaries both of those he writes about, and his readers. <br /> <br />How many more such abusive frauds are there awaiting exposure? When will the publishing industries take responsibility for checking the facts of what they promote as memoir? When will the reviewers, the interviewers, the celebrity promoters and fame-mongers follow the recent lead given by Oprah Winfrey and take care before, or some responsibility after spreading such harm?
B000BYA5GO|4.0|It not really a shoot em up. It's not much of a laugh. But what it is, is an under-seen, thoughtful, entertaining cautionary tale of our world. See it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Ah, what can you say about 'Underworld'? Most notably, it needs more action.  The biggest action scene is at the very beginning, and then we've gotta whole lot of plot for a very long time.  The action scenes are, of course, your standard John Woo knockoff, particularly this opening one.  This isn't really a criticism on my part-- If you're gonna knock of a particular action director, Woo is the way to go.  It's also hurt by the fact that the opening action scene is by far the best one in the film.  Ya gotta pace yourself, Underworld!  Still, their just isn't enough killing.  The story elements are amusing in their way, but the balance is way off.<br /><br />Almost equally important, 'Underworld' could really use a sense of humor.  This movie is so silly and yet it takes itself completely seriously which makes it all the more ridiculous.  If it had a bit of intentional, perhaps self-parodic humor I think I could take the whole thing quite a bit more straight-facedly.<br /><br />The best thing about `Underwold' is the way it looks.  The thing only cost like 23 million, and it looks completely gorgeous and totally creates the alternate, neo-gothic world that is 'Underworld'.  This film is a classic indictment of the excessive use of CGI in Hollywood, particularly for sets-- Not only does this film cost a fraction of what something like 'Revenge of the Sith' costs, it also looks WAY better.  It actually looks *real*, cause it mostly is.  It has some CGI stuff, but it holds well to my personal rule that you should always use practical, real world effects when they can do the job.  The werewolves themselves don't look so hot, but they're the only really disappointment, and the whole thing is really quite stunning considering the cost.  It's an intensely blue colored affair, but it fits the film and feels appropriate, so that's fine.  Another minor visual concern is that the film fails to differentiate between the visual nature of the vampires and the werewolves sufficiently.  More specifically, the human form werewolves lack any real particular style; they just kinda wear ratty old coats, for the most part.  The vampires are, of course, your Blade/Matrix style black leather neo-gothic night club vampires, the variant which has become utterly dominant in modern vampire cinema.  It disturbs me to think that there are probably a lot of people my age and younger who just think that this is the way vampires are, period.  Not that I particularly care for classically styled vampires or anything, I just fear they lack any perspective.  Anyway...<br /><br />Performances tend to be wildly over the top, as is de rigeur for modern vampire films.  Bill Nighy is especially fun as the head vampire.  Everyone is pretty hammy, but he really takes it to another level.  Kate Beckinsale is fairly bland, formless protagonist, but, on the other hand, she does spend most of the film in a leather body suit. (This fact which I believe has been mentioned in every review of 'Underworld' yet written, so far be it for me to break tradition.)  I should note that the music is generally overwrought and often irritating.  They used that glass harp or maybe just distant, squealing string sound like a trillion times here and it really gets on my nerves.<br /><br />I found the plot to be vaguely incomprehensible for most of the film, but it all came together eventually, so perhaps this was intentional.  Frankly, I wasn't terribly concerned with the plot.  This is a film you mostly just stare at, impressed half the time, snickering the other half.  The former impression is superior, obviously, but they both work, so it's not a total loss.<br /><br />Grade: C+ufficiently.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|Well, being European I am not that familiar with country music, so I don't really like or not like it. But this music goes perfectly with the movie, especially the instrumental pieces writter by Mr. Santaolalla, in addition there are some really great songs, the best example \\"Love that will never grow old\\", beautifuly performed by Ms. Harris. The only song, where I didn't really feel comfortabe was \\"It's so easy\\". Don't get me wrong, it might be a great song on its own but somehow in my oppinion does not belong with the others. Great music with the movie or on its own.
0307276902|1.0|This is the transcript from the most recent interview between the author and Oprah.  Bottom line is the guy fabricated his work.  He is a fraud.   <br /> <br />\\"I made a mistake,\\" he told Oprah Winfrey during Thursday's show (1-26-2006). \\"I made a lot of mistakes in writing the book and promoting the book.\\" <br /> <br />Did you lie or did you make a mistake? <br /> <br />\\"I think probably both,\\" he said. <br /> <br />Winfrey, whose endorsement of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" turned into it into one of the top-selling books of 2005, retracted her support of the author, saying she felt \\"conned\\" by him. \\"It's embarrassing and disappointing for me,\\" she said. <br /> <br />And even while Frey admitted altering information that he presented as facts, he maintained his book is a memoir. <br /> <br />\\"I don't think it's a novel. I still think it's a memoir,\\" he said. \\"I don't feel like I conned you. I still think the book is about drug addiction and alcoholism and no one is disputing that I was a drug addict and an alcoholic, and it's about the battle to overcome that.\\" <br /> <br />Among the facts he admitted to embellishing: he was jailed for only a few hours, not 87 days; and each character in the book wasn't wholly represented. <br /> <br />\\"Every one of the people in the book existed. I altered things about all of them,\\" he said. <br /> <br />\\"And you altered things about yourself,\\" Winfrey said. <br /> <br />She pressed: \\"Why would you lie about the time you spent in jail?\\" <br /> <br />\\"I think part of what happened with a number of the things in the book, is when you go through an experience like the one I went through you develop different coping mechanisms. I think one of the coping mechanisms I developed was this image of myself that was greater than what I was,\\" he said. <br /> <br />\\"In order to get through the experience of an addiction, I thought of myself as being tougher than I was, badder than I was. It helped me cope. When I was writing the book, instead ofbeing as introspective as I should have been, I clung to that image.\\" <br /> <br />Winfrey said: \\"Did you cling to that image because that's how you wanted to see yourself or because that would make a better book?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Probably both,\\" he responded. <br /> <br />Winfrey made the paperback version of the book a best-seller after picking it for her coveted book club last September. Frey was a guest on her Oct. 26 show, titled \\"The Man Who Kept Oprah Awake at Night.\\" <br /> <br />However, according to The Smoking Gun, an investigative Web site, a six-week investigation showed Frey's life was far less exciting than he made it out to be in the memoir, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies and remains atop The New York Times' nonfiction paperback best-seller list. <br /> <br />According to the Smoking Gun account, \\"When we asked Frey if his reporting of the laundry list of juvenile crimes and arrests was accurate, he answered, 'Yeah, some of 'em are, some of 'em aren't. I mean I just sorta tried to play off memory for that stuff.'\\" <br /> <br />On Thursday's show, Frey acknowledged the Smoking Gun \\"was pretty accurate, absolutely.\\" <br /> <br />\\"They did a good job detailing some of the discrepancies between some of the actual facts of the events,\\" he said. <br /> <br />Winfrey also apologized to viewers for calling CNN's Larry King two weeks ago and lending her support to Frey. <br /> <br />\\"I regret that phone call,\\" she said. \\"I made a mistake. I left the impression that the truth does not matter, and I am deeply sorry about that. That is not what I believe. <br /> <br />\\"I called in because I loved the message of his book. At the time, every day, I was reading e-mail after e-mail from people who were inspired by his story. And I have to say I allowed that to cloud my judgment. To everyone who has challenged my position, you are absolutely right.\\" <br /> <br />Nan Talese of Doubleday, the book's publisher, said she learned of the fabrications at the sametime everyone else did -- when The Smoking Gun published its report. <br /> <br />\\"I was dismayed to know that,\\" she said, adding that she never approached the author on whether Smoking Gun's report was true. <br /> <br />\\"As an editor, do you ask someone, 'Are you really as bad as you are?'\\" Talese said. <br /> <br />\\"Yes, yes, yes! Yes, you do,\\" Winfrey said to loud applause. <br /> <br />Talese said Frey has written an author's note, describing to the reader \\"parts of the book that have been changed.\\" <br /> <br />As for Frey, he's hoping to learn from the whole ordeal. <br /> <br />\\"I feel like I came here and (have) been honest with you, and essentially admitted to lying. It's not an easy thing to do in front of an audience full of people and a lot of others watching on TV,\\" he told Winfrey. <br /> <br />\\"If I come out of this with anything, it's being a better person and learning from my mistakes and making sure I don't repeat them.\\" <br /> <br />
B00007K02F|3.0|I might very well call this \\"the summarized version.\\" It just runs for about two hours. Most of the important scenes are here but not all. It has good sets, costumes and a very good view of the countryside. It also gives a good gothic feel on some parts. However, this adaptation I think lacks some soul into it.<br /><br />Yes, Charlotte Gainsbourgh fits the physical description almost perfectly (only she's not that small). I just get a bit distracted by her accent. Moreover, in contrast to Anna Paquin, she fails a bit. True enough that the adult Jane is not as passionate as young Jane, but the adult Jane still has some spirit that Charlotte Gainsbourgh failed to portray.<br /><br />William Hurt is not a very bad Rochester. Maybe he isn't given that much time to brood as Timothy Dalton. Due to the time constraint, he failed to develop as much as I wanted with Jane. As a result, his Rochester becomes only pathetic. He is not mad as Timothy Dalton. If one might not have read the book, one might surmise that Jane fell in love with him out of pity or something of that sort.<br /><br />For me, this adaptation can pass. Yes, \\"better than some\\" but not that \\"well.\\"
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera is one of the most awsome bands ever and Vulgar Display of Power is one of the best Pantera albums. Walk is probley the most popular song on the album but Its not my personal favorite but still a great song. F***ing Hostile is one of my favorite songs on the album. Mouth for War is a good song to. You got to get this CD.
B000784WMW|5.0|Goodness! My copy was just here for a week and my DVD player can't bear to part with it.<br /><br />Yes, Zerah Clarke is a little too old. But she's really a very good Jane who can really shoot out a good reply to Rochester's remarks. They are both very witty in their conversations. Beside Timothy Dalton, she's very small. In some scenes, she looks very childlike beside him so for me that makes up for the age factor. When one sees her, I think she is the perfect picture of what the Victorians call \\"the angel of the house.\\"<br /><br />Yes, one might not agree with Timothy Dalton when he said: \\"I know that you are no more pretty than I am handsome\\", but in terms of his acting, I think no one could equal him as Rochester. He extracts the reaction one experiences with Rochester in the book. One minute you hate him and then the next you fall in love with him all over again. He makes one understand why Jane really fell in love with a guy like Rochester. I became a little afraid of him bec. he talked \\"like a sphinx.\\"<br /><br />There is no breathtaking orchestra, no picturesque cinematographies but it all comes out very well. My favorite scenes are all there: Rochester begging Jane (\\"Jane, my hope--my love--my life!\\"), the gypsy scene, excellent Jane-Rochester teasings with very good chemistry, and some portions at Whitcross and Moor House. Sometimes though, the dialogue is too long. They could have trimmed it a bit.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the BEST Jane Eyre adaptation that a literary purist such as I could ever wish for.
B000002P6R|4.0|Death of Moon; band gets with Kenny Jones, they do some amazing shows that are widely acclaimed; unfortunate fans stampede brings gloom to the band that doesn't lift until they retire. Makes it way to this album which is the lighest, poppiest, boppiest, mellowest, weirdest, lamest, who album ever. <br /> <br />But you know what? It's still fine; if people like solo Pete (which this sounds EXACTLY like) why dislike this album? Because in the context of The Who it sounds weak; people had a rampaging monster of hard rock, synth experimentation, and desperation in Who Are You, one of the Who's finest albums, and then this album comes out and there is no synth experimentation; it seems as if Pete just used whatever setting the synth came with. Plus, one song has a chorus that goes THERE AIN'T NO BEARS IN THERE! And Roger sounds like he'd rather be balladering on Broadway. <br /> <br />But this album holds together because the songs are melodic, and all have interesting twists. Some have great melodies, some have interesting little twists in the arrangments... oh sure, this is among the weakest who albums ever. But one can sit back, and relax to it, and stomp their foot along to the beat, and smile at the homespun nature of the record. If Pete had released it solo... I bet people would have liked it. And enough about Kenny Jones; it's unfair to compare him to Keith, as nobody has ever drummed like Keith. Kenny is a good drummer.
0307276902|5.0|I too started this book, I have not finished it simply because I have 3 children and barely have time.  Now, I am not sure whether to complete the book or not.  I am so tainted by all of the controversy and wish I never saw any of it on TV until I was done reading it!!  I really liked the book and feel sorry for James Frey.  I think he truly regrets it.  Although he never said \\"sorry\\", I don't think he has to.  He has been humiliated enough and I think this may be detrimental to his recovery.  I believe he was/is an addict and that is all that matters (to me).  I even purchased one for my 11 year old son to read.  I am totally against the graphic words and violence in the book and think my son will be exposed enough to these words in 'real life',  but I was trying to show him the effects that drugs and alcohol can have on your life and just wanted to  SCARE the heck out of him.....does that make me a bad Mom?  If it scares my son enough, than I thank James Frey!   <br /> <br />Gina
0307276902|5.0|Blast off from the first paragraph...extremely powerful and inspirational story about courage, the strength of the human spirit, and learning to love and forgive yourself. I could care less if James Frey embellished details (frankly, I don't care if he got the entire story by reading tea leaves) in the book, it doesn't change the fact that it's the most powerful and entertaining book I've ever experienced. The audiobook is great: the narrator does an amazing job translating the raw emotion in Frey's words. I would recommend this to ANYONE.
0307276902|2.0|I try to avoid any book recognized by Oprah, and within the mainstream, but I thought I would give this one a chance for a change. BIG MISTAKE!<br /><br />As I read, some of Mr. Frey's drug/alcohol induced episodes seemed too \\"hyper-fantastic\\" to be coming from a memoir. I thought to myself: \\"This has to be fiction!\\" Sure enough, the truth came out....<br /><br />My quick review:<br /><br />Bad prose, inaccurate facts, fabricated story, and the book is promoted by Oprah, supposedly one of the most highly regarded literary critics in the nation. Need I say more?
B00003CXZ4|4.0|In the very first few moments of this strange film, you find out who raped and murdered Leonard Shelby's wife -- but as the story progresses, receding into the past, you become unsure until, at the very end, you know -- maybe -- that Leonard has set himself up. The whole world, you discover, is subjective. Short-term memory loss means you can lie to your later self and Christopher Nolan, who wrote and directed. makes the most of the possibilities. For one thing, there are no big-name stars (Carrie-Anne Moss from the _Matrix_ movies is as close you come) so you can concentrate on the story, and on the confusion that inevitably strikes the first-time viewer. And there are some problems: For instance, who the hell is Dodd? Can you believe Teddy's explanation? Inevitably, as in life, there are no absolude answers. And, as with _Pulp Fiction,_ _Mulholland Drive,_ and a few other recent non-linear films, you'll enjoy this one more as you re-watch it.
0307276902|1.0|When I was reading the book, I knew it was a lie - it sounded like a man's desires to be what he is really not.  If you listened to him, you will know that he is wimpy and a compulsive lier. Actually it was so fake, I read two other books between finishing this one!  Anyone could make up bunch of fantasies to help addicts and it is so sad that all he wanted in the end with his publisher was to make millions for themselves and NOT help by any means someone who needed the truth to help him through.  If I could return the book, I would because I do not want to contribute to any repulsive lier a penny of my HONEST earned money. Especially now that you all know it's a fake, believe me, it does not impress!  Just make up your own lies - it's more fun and cheaper! Definately NOT WORTH THE READ!
0385507755|5.0|Whether James Frey embellished actual events portrayed in this book or not, do not deter you from reading this classic book about recovery. This powerful piece of literature will leave you understanding addiction and recovery in a way you never thought possible. James has recovered and has stayed clean and for that he deserves respect and admiration for bringing a phenomenal read to all of us. I could not put this book down. Do not let the controversy rob you of reading an amazing story.
0446577383|4.0|I have read most of David Baldacci's novels and this is simultaneously one of his best and one of his worst books.  The story is fun, if you can overlook some of the coincidences (although not nearly as many as in a Clancy novel).  The most obvious are that the main character just happens to witness a murder, that just happens to get assigned to the one secret service agent that he knows well, and who just happens to be partnered at the last minute with the long lost daughter of the main character.  It's a bit of a stretch.  However, the plot moves along and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The worst part of the book, as has been well noted by many other reviewers, is his continual use of liberal propaganda disguised as fact.  One of the previous reviewers complimented Baldacci for his research.  Before he does that, the reviewer should look up some of the \\"facts\\" quoted in the book.  Many of them just aren't true.  In summary, it was an entertaining book, but most of the political propaganda could have been left out.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Much has been written, so I apologize for repeat observations here.<br /><br />Background wrt Firefly: I just don't know where I was when the initial Firefly series came out... I was watching one of the TV award shows, saw them get an award, but realized I had never heard of them. My loss as I love good Sci-Fi. When I was first told that it was a blend of \\"kinda western, in the future, with some people referring to it as \\"space opera\\" I had reservations.  However the original Firefly series blended it all together with a marvelous tapestry and cohesiveness that seemed believable and very enjoyable. It was as much a story about future shock, large government control, and close bonds of interpersonal relationships closely woven into each story line, as it was about being entertaining sci-fi.<br /><br />Regarding Serenity: First, I disagree somewhat with people who think the movie stands entirely on its own. IMHO, I really think you need to see at least some, if not all, of the Firefly series first to fully enjoy Serenity. For one example, the movie opens with the operative from the parliament that rules the Alliance,  reviewing the rescue of River. It first appears to be a flashback in someone's mind, but it then quickly becomes clear that the rescue is a stored recording the agent is playing back for his own purposes. Against the backdrop of the Firefly series it all makes perfect sense. Without it, it is, IMO hard to make sense of.<br /><br />That said, the movie was well done, and I said \\"close to marvelous\\" because while I couldn't quite put my finger on why I didn't enjoy it as much as the Firefly series, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars.<br /><br />One big disappointment was that they never explained away just what Shepherd Book's past was really all about. At his end he said something like, \\"And you'll never know.\\"  Another disappointment was I hated to see so many characters die. Maybe Josh was telling us that \\"that's it\\" and there won't be any more, but I hated to see the door shut on some of the characters I enjoyed so much and wanted to see a lot more of.  I also didn't like that Book's role was so minor to the Serenity film.<br /><br />In closing, I give it 4 Stars and recommend it highly, but strongly suggest you see Firefly first.r shut on some of the characters I enjoyed so much and wanted to see a lot more of.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|For Devotees of the 1995 miniseries who have disected, and can recite the entire thing ... this movie will annoy you slightly, but at the same time it will be a breath of fresh air.  I f you just can't get enough P&P, you will enjoy the new scenery and different take on several of the scenes.  What will annoy you is the much weaker, and more bland actors.  With the exception of Kiera Knightly, who in my opinion carries the entire movie, the actors are altogether less outrageous and entertaining than those in the 95 version.  Being that the novel is a study of human folly, the 95 cast brings humor and outlandish behavior to life, as they were meant to.  In this new film, they are just dull by comparison.  Aside from that, this latest version of the classic novel, has a much more lush and interesting setting, and Kiera Knightly is outstanding as Elizabeth, bringing her own witty and fresh flavor to a heroin that everybody knows and loves. All in all I found the movie to be worth my while, as a new way to experience one of my favorites.

B000AGTPUA|5.0|breathtaking. there is no other word for it. this movie was NOT boring or predictable as someone stated earlier. the animation was just beyond words and my whole family had fun trying to figure out which characters were played by tom hanks. and as to the comment that it might frighten young children, this movie is less scary than disney's incredibles (also a great movie)  this movie had everyone on the edge of their seats.  it was so well written and the music was fabulous. i intend on getting the soundtrack if they offer it.  if you like behind the scenes bits, get the two disc set. its it worth it.  it shows you just how they make the animation so real looking.
0670033375|4.0|Diamond's approach to the topic of how societies survive or fail to survive is based on a case-study approach of a number of ancient civilizations. It's methodical but not a wallow in high-science (although citations as opposed to a bibliography would have been nice); it's speculative, but based in the best facts that we have available to us. It's impressive to put this much information together into a coherent, accessible, relevant, and interesting work. He really delves into some interesting history, and the first part of the book is really the most interesting. I wouldn't say he has problems moving to modern times, but...<br /><br />Diamond does deal with counter-arguments to the doom-and-gloom scenarios he makes, but I'd rather have seen him apply the same methodical approach to those counterpoints--to really have taken on the critic's views instead of largely dealing with them in a few paragraphs. Despite the bulk of historical evidence that Diamond has so carefully laid out, critics can still dismiss the relevance of it to the present state of the world by citing some recent biased study puked up by industry-sponsored researchers that showed all is well and we should buy some more stuff. I mean, the way Diamond lays it out it all seems so obvious, but I'd rather have seen him rip into credible counterarguments (if those even exist).<br /><br />He (rationally) throws his objectivity out the door at the end of the book in his hope-for-the-future section. Who wouldn't, given that the alternative is to accept that your offspring (or their offspring) are going to be facing some pretty critical situations in the coming decades, and averting those are in the hands of our political l-haha ah ha aha. Sorry, our fearless political leaders.<br /><br />I was left asking \\"well, what more can I do then?\\" and here Diamond basically says \\"If you'd like to learn more about how not to pave the road to the next collapse, visit your local library!\\" Dammit, I want to know if there's any meaning to me spending 2 hours of my weekend sorting and hauling my recycling to the drop center in this podunk town when all the retirees on my block produce more trash in a week than I do in a month and my recycled glass is just ground up and used as cover for the landfills I was trying to keep it out of in the first place. Well, the book is a monumental work without that last part, but it does leave you hanging.<br /><br />After reading collapse, I entertained the idea of mailing this book to my representative--our region is brimming with the potential for wind, nuc-u-lar, and hydroelectric power, and he's a mindless drill-in-ANWR Republican. But, as the reviewer E Evans proves for us below, the knobs who need to read this book won't, and even if they do, they won't get it. So while it's a good read, if you're interested in reading it because you have some sense of community responsibility already--well, you don't need any more of a reason to ride your bike to work in the rain or to buy sustainably-harvested fish, so you'll get little from Collapse (you certainly won't get any consolation). If you just want good a nonfictional tale and don't give a damn about the problems we're going to be facing when we can't get lumber from Uraguay anymore cause you'll be dead by then anyway, you'll love the book. And if you're ripping pissed that those enviroterrorists are now infringing on your god-given right to tear through national parks on your 2-cycle snowmobile after the enviro-Commies already cheated you out of the lead you used to be able to get with your 0.99-dollar-a-gallon gas...isn't there a Fox special you should be watching?spending 2 hours of my weekend sorting and hauling my recycling to the drop center in this podunk town when all the retirees on my block produce more trash in a week than I do in a month and my recycled glass is just ground up and used as cover for the landfills I was trying to keep it out of in the first place.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I went to see Brokeback Mountain because I know that Ang Lee is a brillant director and I was more than pleased.  The movie is beautifully shot and very well acted.  Heath Ledger's performance was so powerful that I felt his pain of being in love and not being able to realize the relationship fully and openly.  At the end of the day, this was a deeply moving love story and the characters just happened to be gay.  Anyone who shys away because the film has gay characters is really missing one of the best films in a long time.  I encourage people on the fence about seeing this film to take the leap and go and see it and I am certain there will be no disappointment.  Themes about love and longing are color/gender blind and everyone can relate to them.   I loved the film!!! <br />

B000003TA9|5.0|A very good sonic youth effort, I must say. Admittedly, there are a lot of songs on here I actually just don't listen to for one reason or another. But the songs I do listen to make up for it.  <br />100% - GREAT. rocks. 'nuff said. <br />SWIMSUIT ISSUE -  really like the lyrics of this kim number. \\"don't touch my breast / i'm just working at the desk\\" <br />THERESA'S SOUND-WORLD - good vocal by thurston here, but the title really does it justice. it's a sound-world of waxing guitars. <br />DRUNKEN BUTTERFLY - this song even sounds like its title, and is one of my favorites on the album. kim sings ' i love you i love you i love you whats your name?' quite appropriately. grating riff. <br />SHOOT - another good Kim song, about domestic violence in some way, it seems. but maybe that's my over-literal interpretation. \\"you only hit me when you wanna be pleased\\".. kind of a sad, but in the end, vengeful song. i like it a lot. <br />WISH FULFILLMENT - another favorite on here. like the lyrics a lot, and good vocals by lee. check out the rehearsal recording from the remasters as well, for an interesting take. <br />SUGAR KANE - really great song, rocks hard. brings back a lot of good memories of someone i used to have feelings for, probably because they liked this song so much. <br />ORANGE ROLLS, ANGEL'S SPIT - don't listen to this one. just too obnoxious for me. <br />YOUTH AGAINST FASCISM - i really want to like this song, but.. <br />NIC FIT - no. this reminds me of being a 16-year-old at a TRUCK GRIND YOUR FACE show, not wanting to have people spill beer on me anymore. <br />ON THE STRIP - another great kim song. dark feeling, reminds me of SHOOT. <br />CHAPEL HILL - one of the songs i liked a lot when i first got this album because it was immediately accessible, and it still is pretty rocking. <br />JC - a high point of this album, definitely. something about this song is hypnotic and captivating, like you don't want to leave its presence. great lyrical work here andsonically it's just so fresh. <br />PURR - good song, but not -that- good. <br />CREME BRULEE - eh. like i said. <br />
0763627410|5.0|This is a big, fun book with bold, colorful artwork, typical of the clean, direct style that guides Cousins' wildly successful \\"Maisy\\" series.  A cute little fish, named \\"Little Fish,\\" gives us a tour of the undersea world, introducing us to a bunch of fancifully named friends (\\"ele-fish,\\" \\"eye fish,\\" \\"sky fish,\\" etc.)  This has a very Dr. Seuss-y feel to it...  It's visually arresting, rhymes well and fun to read aloud.  Recommended!
B0007DAZW8|1.0|A totally disappointing effort by the band. The whole thing sounds like they weren't interested. The best track on here is 'Robot Rock' which is an undeveloped sample of a funny song by Breakwater. After releasing this undeveloped work after four years it wouldn't surprise me if both of them aren't interested in producing  together, if at all, any more. Check out their excellent album Homework and forget this.

0307276902|5.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was nothing short of an amazing book.  Whether there are discrepancies in James Frey's convictions or not, it is still fantastic.  In this true story, James Frey tells of his six weeks in a rehabilitation center in the rural Upper Midwest.  What makes \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" truly unique is the fact that it is not only one story being told, but there are several little stories told along with the plot.  The stories that James reveal to the reader are shocking and, somewhat, entertaining; they keep you wanting more.  His use of the English language is rather interesting as well. <br /> <br />    <br /> His broken grammar and syntax seem to make \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" actually live up to its name, and they also add a feeling rigidness to the book.  James' vivid allusions to his teenage years also contribute to the landscape of the story;  they make it quite interesting.  Repetition is also a major device used by James.  Meaningful or important words or phrases in the book seem to be restated over and over again repeatedly.  The repetitions were probably included to aid the reader, and they sometimes served to show an emotion such as anger or rage.  <br /> <br /> <br /> James' style of writing is unique and one-of-a-kind.  The way that he expresses feelings is very personal.  His ability to convey an idea or a tone is superb.  The overall message that James was trying to display in \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was one of hope.  This hope is for anyone who wants to avoid conventional fixes to alcoholism or any addiction for that matter.  James' desire and hope to free himself from addiction entirely are contagious.  It was a masterpiece, and I would suggest \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey to anyone.
B000000W6R|5.0|This, without a doubt, is one of the best alternative albums of the era, nevermind that it's a b-sides collection of sorts. All of the songs are good, and it's very listenable. billy corgan obviously doesn't know when he's written a good song. <br />lol. <br />hilights include - \\"frail & bedazzled,\\" \\"whir,\\" \\"hello kitty kat,\\" and \\"starla,\\" which is classic.
0307276902|4.0|Listen, think what you want about the ultimate truth of the work. That's up to each of us. But for me, reading is an escape. I get to experience a life that I will usually never see. In this case, I have never been drug or alcohol addicted or through rehab. Whether all of the details are true or not, I got to escape from my reality and dive into another reality, and that for me is the essence, the joy of reading. I have read many memoirs that seem a bit fantastical, a bit too \\"pat\\", espeically when it comes to celebrities. So I applaud James Frey for getting this work published. I think the publisher should have had a disclaimer or some sort, such as \\"names, dates, events have been changed to protect the innocent\\" or some such. Other than that, I'm good. He's a talented man who seems to have helped a lot of people and that seems to be overlooked in all the hoopla. I like Oprah, but I think her anger is misplaced on the author: he did his job--he riveted her, he excited her, he gave her an escape. That is why we read.
0307276902|1.0|Many of you are going to be curious about all the controversy stirred up lately about the \\"truthiness\\" of this so-called \\"memoir\\".  If you've followed the headlines, you'll have seen that James Frey has been exposed as a liar and a fraud.  When I read this book a few weeks ago, I was very inspired and moved by its frank and brutal depiction of addiction.  Some of the passages were somewhat over-dramatic, but I believed them since Frey continuously hammered down the point that he is dedicated to \\"brutal honesty\\".  Anyone who saw him on Oprah recently saw how pathetic this supposed hardcore, no-excuses, bad-ass really is.  The man is obviously a pathological liar (like many addicts) and he wrote this manipulative book to make himself seem like a hero and a warrior for the modern age.  He is instead just a con and a coward.  He owes everyone an apology, and Amazon should reclassify this book as FICTION.  Anyone can embelish a horrible experience in his or her life and pass it off as a grandiose nightmarish tale of survival -- don't be suckered in by Frey and his bull$%&*  Avoid his new book \\"My Friend Leonard\\" too, since it's probably nothing than a gangster-fatherhood pack of lies as well.  Frey owes everyone a REAL apology.  I would highly recommend \\"Dry\\" by Augusten Burroughs as an alternative if you are looking for an honest memoir about addiction and recovery.

1400031087|5.0|With all of the media coverage regarding this book's truth or lies, I want to comment that regardless of how much of the writing is factual, it is still a very powerful book with an insight to the addicted mind and spirit that is unprecented.  The book has had an impact on me and everyone else that has read it.  It is still a great book.
B000003TA2|4.0|I'm a big SY fan, but this wasn't one of the first albums of theirs i got, thinking it to be overhyped and perhaps too overly commercial, if that was possible. So then I bought it, and I liked some of the songs, especially the very palatable KOOL THING, the rocking DIRTY BOOTS, and the spiraling DISAPPEARER. and other than those, this album mostly just collected dust for a while. This felt like a SY that belonged to someone else-- someone with a skateboard. But then I put it back in and, especially after the Goo Remasters came out recently, I haven't been able to put it down. TUNIC is a great song about karen carpenter, and i listen to it all the time. MY FRIEND GOO is a good, playful song, and TITANIUM EXPOSE kicks. and the rest of the songs except SCOOTER&JINX also are very good. One thing worth mentioning is that the Remasters have a really amazing song called \\"Lee #2\\" which is probably now one of my favorites that he's ever made, and i can't figure out why it wasn't put on the album in the first place!
0307276902|3.0|As everyone knows by now, many of the details of this story were completely fabricated by Frey. That being said, if taken as a work of fiction, it is an entertaining page turner. If this book had been labeled \\"based on a true story,\\" I think it would have stood up to all of the criticisms and Frey would not have come out looking so bad.<br /><br />This is a story of someone with a terrible past and nothing to live for. He somehow manages to find redemption and purpose in life while brazenly ignoring all of the advice given to him by the experts at rehab. If you are interested in taking a peek into the mind of an addict, this book is for you. If you are an addict looking for inspiration to stay sober, I recommend that you look elsewhere.

This truth and fiction business seems to have become an issue in our culture, from \\"reality shows\\" which aren't anywhere close to reality to staged fights on Jerry Springer to story after story in newspapers which turn out to be made up, wholly or in part.<br /><br />The truth DOES matter.

6305807086|4.0|It would be easy to analyze this film as a puppet show within a puppet show, as a puppeteer ultimately caught in his own strings, and so on, but none of that gets at what is most striking about it.  The film creates a world with its own logic, to which it stays true enough.  The characters act as we would expect them to, once we know who they really are.  What stands out in the film is the masterly, fresh comedy, from hilarious quirks to perfect deadpan send-ups of artistic and other high pretensions.  (And there's some excellent puppet work that the film doesn't invite us to fully appreciate.)  But all of that will be undermined for some by the emotional ambiguity of the film.<br /><br />It begins the way many quirky comedies do, with what appears to be a basically decent person with sensibilities normal enough that we can identify with them, surrounded by other characters who are more cartoonish and off-kilter.  The contrast and tension between the normal and strange heightens the comic effect.  We are drawn in a little, enough to sympathize, but by the end of the film no character has developed into anyone we really care much about, and to the extent we do still care, our sentiments are rewarded with what ought to be chilling results, though they're played more for their dark humor.  No one turns out to have the capacity for any but the most superficial human warmth and love, obsession and casual sex taking their place.  Arguably the adults in the film deserve their fates, or, in the case of Malkovich, deserve only limited sympathy.<br /><br />But what of the fate of the young girl at the end, whose psyche is already violated?  Well, either we can laugh it off and treat the film as a superficial comedy in which such things shouldn't be dwelt on, or we can identify with her as real and feel bad for her, in which frame of mind this becomes a more disturbing film all around than is generally acknowledged.<br /><br />This sour note isn't so much the fatal flaw of this film as it is the clearest indication of it.  The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.  At times we seem to be dealing with people like us, with whom we should identify; at other times we see them as lacking real souls.  This may be regarded as part of the conceit of the film, that the rules of this alternate universe include that humans aren't fully human, or are only ambiguously so (which, of course, can be seen in context of the puppet theme).  That makes the film consistent in its way, but it's an ambiguity that leaves us unable to fully respond to the characters and what happens to them.  Comedy mistreats its characters, but if we're induced to care about them at first, it's more than comedy when they're truly hurt, or when we no longer care if they're hurt.<br /><br />That will bother some people more than others, and, judging from the reviews, most people not at all.  If you like Fargo and Rushmore, you'll probably love this.  Just don't get too attached to the characters or anything else that seems genuine at first if you want to enjoy it as comedy.  And if you want to see it as tragic and disturbing, the overall comic approach may be more bothersome than helpful.rest indication of it.  The emotional balance of the film is unsettled.

B000000WA4|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made, by anyone. Where it fits in that list of top 25 is hard to say and quite arguable, but nonetheless, it deserves a spot.  <br />A lot of people will argue till they're blue in their faces about whether this or SIAMESE DREAM is the best Smashing Pumpkins album. Let me say, I give SIAMESE DREAM 5 stars as well, but  it is just not the same work of art that this is. This is truly a masterpiece, and Billy Corgan hasnt' made anything that's come close since. <br />MELLON COLLIE .. - great instrumental, perfect way to start an album. <br />TONIGHT, TONIGHT - obviously a classic. when i first heard this song, i was shocked. i'd never heard anything quite like this before. <br />JELLY BELLY - good rock song. great lyrics as usual. \\"welcome to nowhere fast\\".. but could be too 'heavy metal' for some people. <br />ZERO - great lyrics, great rock song. gets skipped a lot by me though since i've heard it too many times. <br />HERE IS NO WHY - i like this song a lot, but i didn't always. the chorus is great -- \\"may the king of gloom be forever doomed!\\" <br />BULLET with BUTTERFLY WINGS - great title, and great rock song. it always seemed like kind of a joke on angst to me. \\"despite all my rage, i'm still just a rat in a cage\\" <br />TO FORGIVE - sad song about childhood. not always immediately accessible, but it grows on you a lot. <br />F--- YOU (AN ODE TO NO ONE) - great song. the guitar work is amazing. really knocks my socks off. <br />LOVE - not one of my favorites, but still alright. good lyrics. <br />CUPID DE LOCKE - very interesting song, and there is no other SP song (OR ANY OTHER SONG, FOR THAT MATTER) that is like it. the lyrics are somewhat of an old-style (i dont know what it's called) poem, and the music is quite fantastic. <br />GALAPOGOS - one of the best songs on the album, and has great lyrics and the vocal he delivers is INTENSE, by all means. musically excellent as well. <br />MUZZLE - good rock song, but until i heardhis acoustic version from the United Center show (their 2nd to last performance) i didn't really 'get' it. it's his favorite pumpkins song, and the lyrics are very very good. empowering. <br />PORCELINA OF THE VAST OCEANS - amazing song, especially the encapsulating and hypnotic intro. great guitar work. great vocals. <br />TAKE ME DOWN - a good song by james, but doesn't really fit with the rest of the album, imo. <br />-DISC 2- <br />WHERE BOYS FEAR TO TREAD - excellent rocker. love the riff here, very dark. <br />BODIES - another excellent rocker, great lyrics. \\"no bodies ever knew / no bodies felt like you\\" <br />THIRTY-THREE - highly underrated last single from the album. if i were to use an overused word, it would be 'poignant' <br />IN THE ARMS OF SLEEP - one of my favorites, acoustic, amazing lyrics, a feeling all of us have identified with- \\"i'll always need her more than she could ever need me / i need someone to ease my mind / but sometimes a someone is so hard to find\\" <br />1979 - everyone knows this song. it's great. <br />TALES OF A SCORCHED EARTH - everyone hates this song. i don't, personally. i just never listen to it. good lyrics, but i suggest reading them instead of listening to it unless you're feeling angry. <br />THRU THE EYES OF RUBY - excellent song, and the end of it features the reprise to the title track, which is excellent, and done on acoustic guitar. <br />STUMBLEINE - one of my absolute favorite songs. very minimal, just billy on acoustic guitar, singing a very personal and touching song. excellent. <br />X.Y.U. - great rock song, great contrast after the previous song. i love this one. <br />WE ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT - very simple song, but i like it a lot. i like the vocals. <br />BEAUTIFUL - really really great song. great lyrics, great singing, great music, great production. great. should i say 'great' again? yes. it's great. <br />LILY - really good song for the voyeur in you. lily was his cat, and i think there's a picture of her on the back of the 'i am one' single, perhaps? in any case, another really good song. <br />BY STARLIGHT - spectacular song, and sonically it blows me away. such emotional intensity rules this song. 'and are you just like me? her eyes were as vacant as the seas..' <br />FAREWELL AND GOODNIGHT - great song that features all of the members singing, which is the only instance of this on an official release. i think they should have done this at their last show, but they didn't. jimmy can't sing very well but he does alright. d'arcy and james are sweet together though. <br /> <br />BUY THIS, and BUY IT NOW. Also highly recommended are the b-sides to this album, \\"THE AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH\\" boxed set, which features some of the Pumpkins' best work ever, incl. \\"MEDELLIA OF THE GRAY SKIES,\\"  \\"THE LAST SONG,\\" \\"THE AEROPLANE FLIES HIGH (TURNS LEFT, LOOKS RIGHT)\\" \\"MY BLUE HEAVEN\\" \\"MARQUIS IN SPADES,\\" \\"PENNIES,\\" and \\"ROTTEN APPLES\\" <br />

0307276902|5.0|CNN has been covering the revelation that this autobiography is mostly made-up for about 20 hours today, and I think it's safe to say that CNN will continue to cover this story for about another 3 or 4 days. So it looks like Frey's going to make out even better now than he did when Oprah first endorsed the book. You can see the book going up in the Amazon best-sellers list by the hour. I think all the coverage is going to be great for Oprah's show too. She \\"confronted\\" Frey today on her show. Yes, she was embarassed and humiliated and yadda yadda yadda. But her ratings were sky high. And Anderson Cooper of CNN can't seem to get enough of this story. Obviously, CNN is going to make out pretty good with the story too. <br /> <br />So what is the lesson to be learned here? No really, I'd like to know.
0790740249|3.0|Copycat sheds light on a serial killer who imitates other known serial killers in an effort to gain fame and immortality. <br />The acting and the dialogues are rather weak with the exception of Sigourney Weaver who does a good job of trying to cover up for the rest who really do disappoint with their performances, especially Holly Hunter who is much more like a schoolteacher than a police detective.  On the other hand the plot and the setting are actually very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers had made more of an effort. <br />Overall, far from being a masterpiece, Copycat will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.   <br /> <br />If you're in the mood for some AMAZING thrillers, check out Resurrection, The Bone Collector, Seven, and of course The Silence of the Lambs. <br />
B000002MTR|4.0|While four stars may indicate that I really, really like this album, to be honest, I more often than not skip it in favor of \\"Mother's Milk.\\" I also think that \\"Bloodsugarsexmajick\\" is superior to this album. However, the album spawned several great radio hits that are maligned I think more because people missed John Frusciante and may have since then maligned virtuoso guitarrist Dave Navarro for having \\"interrupted\\" the band's progress. I was only 12 or 13 when \\"Warped\\" premiered on MTV in 95, but I remember its having a strange grip on me years after its release. What people need to realize is that I had no idea at the time that Navarro was a new guitarist. Therefore, having been exposed to earlier Pepper's hits, I came into the new music unbiased but informed by previous releases by the band. I didn't necessarily like or hate the first single, but the strange rhythms and insane video left a huge impression on my mind. Years later, I would wait with bated breath for this song to play on the radio (which it rarely does nowadays). Quite simply, the song is manic, and amazing. It is one of the most experimental, challenging, and, to say the least, best singles that the RHCP have ever released. The intro is haunting, the verses are frantic and deliberately off-kilter musically, and the choruses are wonderfully constructed. The song peaks with Dave's frenetic, trill of a solo which manages to sound easier than it is to play. The solo verges on dissonance, but manages to stay in key, and is a perfect compliment to \\"Warped\\"'s frantic pace. Something isn't right in the Pepper's universe here, and this opening song is a good and haunting reminder of where the band (and it's troubled 2nd guitarist Fruciante) were at the time of its release. Navarro is an amazing musician, and is unfairly forgotten in the history of this band. The song drops into chaos and subsequently bottoms out into a pretty (and highly unexpected) outro that sounds quintessentially Peppers and, for me, is testament to the sound of early 90s rock radio. The bass melody and backing arpeggios here are beautiful and this part of the song is truly memorable. Other tracks of note are the addictive (but overplayed) \\"Aeroplane,\\" the funky \\"Walkabout,\\" the predictable but effective \\"My Friends,\\" Cobain tribute \\"Tearjerker,\\" and a few others. Other tracks, like the somewhat experimental but sloppily written \\"Pea,\\" where Flea plays bass accompanied only by his own voice, and \\"Coffee Shop,\\" which is enjoyable enough but loses luster very quickly, fail, sometimes miserably. While the album went multiplatinum, it has been unfairly dismissed by many who are similarly quick to forget that this album spawned more radio hits than \\"Californication,\\" which is truly testament to the time it was released in. To be fair, \\"Californication\\" had higher charting hits, and more enduring ones. Overall, this is a decent Chili Peppers release but nothing you'll ever find on a \\"Greatest Albums\\" list.
B000003TAL|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that Sonic Youth is my favorite band, and that I am beyond a huge music fan. I own [almost] all of their catalogue, and have spend countless hours pouring over their work, contemplating it in many different situations and states of mind. I like the very avant garde, the punk, the rock, and the noise. I like it all. <br />This album, however, as a whole, just doesn't flow for me. Some of the guitars have really great sounds, and there are a handful of actually amazing songs on here. ('Teen Age Riot,' 'Candle,' even 'Eric's Trip') But there are also some completely difficult songs on here that just don't make this album worth listening to very often. It doesn't feel like these songs were as well thought out as they could have been. <br />As far as Sonic Youth having a masterpiece, well.. Why do they need a masterpiece? They have so many great works.  <br />Like almost everyone, this was my first SY disc, but if you're looking for an introduction to SY, get something else. GOO, DIRTY, MURRAY STREET, NURSE, WASHING MACHINE, EVOL, EXPERIMENTAL JET SET TRASH AND NO STAR, and BAD MOON RISING all do it better for me.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a huge fan of this book, so I was surprised at how much I loved the film. Normally movie adaptations of books are more than pitiful.  <br /> <br />My only problem with the movie was that it was not long enough. There was so much more that could have been put in that was not. Though, what was put in was almost perfect. There were some historical inaccuracies as well as book related inaccuracies. Some of these inaccuracies helped show the degree of emotion or importance, like when Lady Catherine calls on Lizzy in the middle of the night, it shows the urgency of her manner. <br /> <br />This movie was well casted. Keira Knightley was absolutely perfect for the part. Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley have great chemistry and a believable passion for one another. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity gives Firefly fans what we all want (besides more Firefly): closure.  Director Whedon does a brilliant job of tying up loose ends by explaining the central mystery of Firefly and even developing the characters more.  He also leaves room for a continuation of the series, by advancing key relationships to points that would allow a new storyline, including making room for new characters.  I can't be more specific w/o including spoilers, but really, this movie's great strength is the amount of material it covers.  The Firefly saga gets wrapped up neatly and satisfyingly and Serenity works well as a a stand-alone because of the very fast pace required to explain what could have been the basis of an entire second season.<br /><br />As other reviewers point out, this is also the movie's only weakness.  Certain parts do seem rushed.  However, what is lost is not terribly significant.  For example, not much time is spent on Jayne, but, hey, Firefly had a whole episode focused on Jayne and his character isn't supposed to be terribly complex.  Meanwhile, Kaylee and Simon both get a lot of attention and River reaches a point where she could be more than merely mysterious and disfunctional.  We also get an explanation of the Reavers.<br /><br />Technically, Serenity is solid.  Good special effects, good dialog, good acting.  For non-Firefly fans, this is the best sci-fi movie to come out in a long while.  It moves faster, is funnier, has more realistic characters, and more interesting relationships than the Star Wars prequels. (I apologize in advance to the George Lucas fans out there). If you like sci-fi, Serenity will be pure joy.  If you like Westerns, it'll be good.  If you don't, this may be the one recent movie that can change your mind.<br /><br />Gongrats to the whole Firefly team.  Serenity could hardly be a better way to finish.
0553208845|5.0|I read Siddhartha after my second business-a venture-capital backed internet start-up-went bust.  As I read this book, I realized I was on Siddhartha's path more than I was on any other human being's path.  Since reading that book, I've realized the world consists of people who \\"get Siddhartha\\" and people who don't.<br /><br />After reading this, I came upon Srikumar Rao, author of Are You Ready To Succeed.  His book is the handbook to living the life of Siddhartha.  The two books are a source of endless inspiration and guidance.
0060527978|4.0|The Warrior of the Light is another great book and an easy delightful read by Paulo Coelho. It's full of wise insights and just as the jacket suggests, it is a companion to The Alchemist. It expounds upon the lessons and answers a few questions that might arise while reading The Alchemist.<br /><br />Although the story wrapped around the snippets of wisdom was a bit confusing, there were so many good insights (read words to live by).  At first I found only a little value in the manual, but as I read on I found myself bookmarking more and more pages.  When I returned to these bookmarks to blog about them, I found them even more inspiring.<br /><br />While I found the wisdom in the book to be very useful and very important, I've rated this book a bit lower than The Alchemist, because it wasn't quite as masterful in using a story to illustrate it's points. It's obvious that Coelho's intention was not to create a story such as in the Alchemist, but I found the lack of story a bit disappointing. I rate The Warrior of the Light at 4 Stars.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|\\"Don't be a coconut, god is trying to talk to you,\\" sings the Strokes front man Julian Casablancas on the song \\"Ask Me Anything.\\" Although I did not find the lyrical content to be truly uplifting on The Strokes third release, First Impressions of Earth, did we ever look to The Strokes for lyrical depth? First Impressions Of Earth is a musically mature and diverse album from beginning to end. The undeniably revolutionary sound The Strokes gave birth to in their debut album, Is This It, can be heard on songs like \\"You Only Live Once\\" and in the crushing guitar riffs of \\"Heart In A Cage.\\" Songs like \\"Electricity\\" host an ambient duo guitar line worth checking out. While a variety of tempos, like a rock-a-billy \\"Juicebox\\" and the wicked off-beats in \\"Killing Lies,\\" make the album interesting. Web link: thestrokes.com.

0060920432|5.0|In writing my own book on happiness, I've researched over three hundred books.  Csikszentmihalyi's Flow and Rao's Are You Ready To Succeed stand atop the pile.  Flow and Are Your Ready to Succeed can help you achieve happiness perhaps quicker and more consistently than any other book.  Reading these will help you internalize the notion that being in control of the mind means that literally anything that happens can be a source of joy <br />   <br />Flow explains that achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not.  Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It's not enough to know how to do it; one must do it, consistently in the same way as athletes. <br />   <br />Without discipline, he explains, we are always getting to live, but never living.   When you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but that your own judgment of them disturbs you. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgment now.   <br />
B000BKJ78U|3.0|This is a fine box set if all you want are the 2004 special edition versions of the Star Wars films of the 70's and 80's without the bonus disk.  The sound and image quality is very nice; much better than it was in 1997.  There are a few tweaks to effects and sound from the 1997 versions.  Like so many of us have opineons on changes for the better or the worse with the special editions, I have my own as well but I'll leave that out of this. <br /> <br />Sadly I had to give this product a lower rating because the packaging is deceptive.  It leads the buyer into thinking they're buying the classic unedited versions.  I think consumers have the right to know what they're buying.  That said, assuming one goes into this with knowledge; it's not a bad buy if you don't want the bonus disk.  You can save a couple bucks and get the same films as the 2004 box set. <br /> <br />That's my basic review of the product.  Now I'd like to say something that not many have said.  Although Lucas sais he will never release the Originals on a new format I think he's bending the truth for the sake of his plans for the films themselves. <br /> <br />By telling the world he won't release the Original films, he's essentially starving the consumer.  In this way when he does decide to release them; it'll be a full blown sell out of every copy on every shelf.  As an independent film maker; he's taking a big gamble editing his classic films; which i think if done in a technically superior form of film crafting is better for the story and the films.  Regardless if we as the audience believe that; it's what Lucas believes.  He puts up his own millions to make this happen.  If he fails to sell, he bears all the damages. <br /> <br />Eventually he'll be done editing the series.  He's even editing footage in the prequels, so none of it is sacred territory.  My belief is his goal is to make the six part series flow as a single body of work; it's supposed to be one movie according to his own words.  When it's all said and done, the OT may be all but consumed by the edited version.  But the unedited versions are still safe and secure in the Lucasfilm archives as well as the Smithsonian. <br /> <br />Regardless of his financial success or failure in the future, releasing the Unedited OT is his ace in the hole. <br /> <br />The point is; don't sweat it so much.  Ofcourse the classic theatrical versions of the OT will see the light of day again. We may not see it on DVD but perhaps BLUERAY, HDDVD or whatever format takes us to the next stage. <br /> <br />Lucas isn't a moron; he's just looking out for his investments.  If he releases the Original Form now then he plays his best hand too soon, before all the chips are in.  The guy knows film history and can appreciate old films for historic and nostalgic reasons.  The films themselves are born of the power of myth.  If anyone understands how OT purists feel, he does.  Just give him a few years to finnish what he started.  In 2007 the series starts its' run in theatres in 3D.  My hunch is this will be the final version.  After that makes a financial recovery, there's no reason not to expect the Original Versions soon after.  It's a nice way to say goodbye to the series and move on to other things.
0307276902|5.0|Alright, this review won't be helpful but it will explain why you should read this book.  Read for James Frey.  This poor man was doing his job by writing a book.  If every memoir was analyzed word for word I assure you that they would all have embellishments and lies. I think Oprah needs to step down from this throne that she has put herself upon and realize that not everyone can get rich from sitting on a couch and talking about useless stuff all day.  This man has the gift of word and he wrote an amazing book and should be rewarded for this.  So to any of you people who read the book, liked it, found out it was false, then hated it... Get a LIFE.  Just because Oprah feels lied to and betrayed doesn't mean the whole world has to.  This is a woman who caused a controversy over not being allowed to shop when a store was CLOSED.  I'm sorry but last I checked when a store is CLOSED, you can't go in and shop. Just because you are Oprah, shouldn't mean you get whatever the hell you want in life.  So everyone stop taking the advice of a crazy, vain, annoying, self-loving mad woman and read the book.  It is amazing and James Frey deserves better treatment than he is getting.
0385507755|1.0|I would not have bought this book if I had not been told it was a true story.  The power of the story I felt while reading it came from my understanding that it was a true story.  However, the story became more and more fantastical toward the end, and I started wondering whether it was true.  Does anyone really believe that he tore his own toenail off?  Does anyone believe that Myles the judge and Leonard the thug got together and managed to get his time reduced?  That sounds like a made for TV movie.  Give me a break!! <br /> <br />The publisher bears much of the responsibility for this con.  If I was questioning the truth of the book partway through, why didn't they?  And what about the parents?  They had to know it was a lie.  When I think of his Mom screaming when she heard O. selected the book, I wonder what she thought about her conceited, lying son making all this money off lies. <br /> <br />He knew that people would be more interested in his book if they were told it was true, so he lied to make money.  To me, that's stealing!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Rightly so, this CD remains a cornerstone record that deserves a place in everyone's library. The writing was superb, and Nash for one, would rarely come up to this standard after this. Stills was determined to prove he was the best damned musician working in the States at that time, and Crosby, oddly enough, was the inspirational glue that held it all together. It wouldn't last, but who knew at this point?  <br />The remastering is the issue here, and this music has always set a fidelity standard that you could measure every other recording by, again, thanks to Stills. Whether on vinyl or in digital formats, there is a presence to this music that is hard to quantify, but its quality is undeniable. The current remastering, on the heels of the superlative solo outing from Stills and the consistently brilliant work by Crosby post clean-up, offers you an intimacy and warmth I hadn't heard on even the very best pressings before. Forget the extra songs, even though they alone would justify a re-purchase, it is the original album that carries the day again and with a dynamic that shows all of Stills' perfectionist tendencies in the best of all possible lights. I'm looking forward, kind of, to the remastering of Daylight Again, and more importantly to Deja Vu, CSN, and Four Way Street, all scheduled for the next two years. Maybe it will be enough to fire up the creative juices for an original release. <br />Whatever, the point is that this is a worthy remaster that will enlighten the already converted and wow the novitiate. Well done, Stephen.
B000003TAR|5.0|this is a great album.  skinny puppy's 'last rights' is also a great album.  there is room for the peaceful coexistence of many great albums, much in the same way that it is possible for apples and oranges to both be great fruits.  by saying that an apple is a masterpiece of fruitmaking, the perfection of an orange's composition is not diminished.  similarly, the beauty of nirvana's 'in utero' does not preclude the possibility for there to be other beautiful works of musical genius, namely those of distinctively different artists.  on a different note, i am of the impression that nirvana was incapable of recording a bad song.  certainly some are better than others, but all are chock-full of a mysterious quality which elevates them to a level of superbness regardless of the production quality.  that being said, 'in utero' is an example of nirvana having recorded songs which, by my previous definition, are guaranteed to not be bad.  also, the production quality is well above par.  this album is wonderfully loud, noisy, and cathartic.

B000BKJ78U|1.0|Like some others, saw the cover art on this box-set in a store, saw no mention anywhere of 'revised editions', and thinking (hoping rather.. - 'A New Hope'? lol) that Lucas had finally 'come to his senses' about releasing the original films...  bought what turned out to be nothing more than a lame re-packaging of the last boxset. (Which I might add - I thought was a rather shoddy product in itself, as aside from the outrageous 'additions'... had some rather sloppy editing/effects (nastier cheap-looking Jabba, rubber-necked slow on the trigger Han, and black squares around some of the ships to mention a few), not to mention a rather cheap box. (I knew something was up when I first picked up that box... and it practically half-collapsed in my hand)<br /><br />Fortunately, I never bought that first set (just conveniently rented it from the library)  and after reading the reviews here on Amazon BEFORE opening the packaging of this latest bit of nonsense... Promptly returned it for a full refund.<br /><br />Sorry George, No cigar.  You want a little more of my money... release the ORIGINAL films on dvd, and I'll gladly hand some over...  Not til then.
B0000013GT|5.0|to me this is when outkast was very hungry, me im not a big fan of southern rap but this album is very different than other southern albums that came out in '96. i like the production on this album its dark and yes im a fan of dark beats.the standout tracks to me are Elevators (Me & You),Ova Da Wudz,Babylon, and Elevators (ONP 86 Mix), its the same as elevator the original except that they changed the drums and it actually has scratching and its edited for some reason. recommended for 90's hip hop fans and fans of outkast and their early material.
0307276902|4.0|What a joke. Stylistically, a find the book entertaining. The minimalist style leaves just enough to the imagination, which makes the read such a harrowing experience. The root canal, which everyone talks about without end, is truly one of the ugliest and most difficult to read literary spaces that I have ever come across. The book is phenomenal, few other words would fit so perfectly as that one. James Frey is a liar, however. He went through very little of what the book describes, and not with even a hint of the savagery he describes. This frat boy from Cleveland, who probably became an addict at one of his frat parties (where coke and acid and ecstasy are available in that one room) in the midst of other spoiled hitleryouths trying to tap their kegs. The smoking gun drilled him. So did Larry King. Now Oprah, on live television, has tearfully told him he duped her. I do believe he was an addict, and classically, addicts are always on the hustle for more. He found a new hustle for his newest high; Fame. Whatever. If I ever see the \\"FTBSITTTD\\" tat coming my way, I'll know that an overpaid fraternity liar with a talent for writing is the one wearing it. He wrote a good book that I enjoyed thouroughly. That may be the only thing that keeps me from gouging that ink out of his skin.
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I can't believe the reviews here! \\"I don't like digipak\\", \\"I don't have 5.1 capability\\", \\"I don't like dual disc\\". Why are you writing a review people? Let's do this proper justice. \\"Remain In Light\\" is arguably the best work by Talking Heads. It's their most multi-layer, polyrhythmic and complex work. Everything was spot on for this recording. The digital remastering on the cd and dvd side PHENOMENALLY improves upon the old cd copy I own. I can't believe fans of the Heads, a cutting edge and experimental band, would dismiss and complain about cutting edge technological advances in sound like the dual disc format! Or digital remastering in general.<br /><br />The cd side is great. The four additional bonus tracks, all previously unissued, are okay. I didn't really enjoy various jam sessions that were left on the cutting room floor. It didn't do anything for me other than demonstrate in interesting experiments the Heads were working on at that time. \\"Unison\\" sounded like a partial demo for what would later become \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\" on \\"Speaking In Tongues\\".<br /><br />The dvd side is phenomenal. I can't believe the improvement. Speechless is a word. Jerry Harrison talks about he 5.1 mixing process in the booklet and tells us that this was the obvious first choice for remixing in 5.1 surround sound, and that it was the first album to be redone in that format. It's easy to hear why. Proper equipment people, PROPER EQUIPMENT! I've never had any trouble with any dual disc I've ever bought. You must experience \\"Remain In Light\\" in 5.1 surround sound to truly have heard the album. The old 2.0 stereo is great, but this 5.1 mix will send you over the edge. There are also a couple of live videos tacked on, which, as I've said in my other reviews, are okay and nice if, like me, you didn't get to see the band in their glory days.<br /><br />The booklet has ruminations by various popular musicians about how great Talking Heads were, and how influential their contributions to popular music were/are. Unfortunately, as I've said in my other Heads reviews, the lyrics are not included like they were in the old cd copy. An oversight. I'm not a fan of digipak, but come on already! If you're a serious music collector like myself, then you know to store your cds in a safe place. I have Can-Ams (metal filing cabinets) where the digipaks stay nice and safe from harm. I'm not planning to use my discs as frisbees anytime soon and I'm careful about handling my cds. So what's the problem? We know the paper wears down faster than the plastic, but the plastic gets just as scratched and scuffed up over time. Dual discs are a bit thicker, but I have not have any trouble playing them in any audio device I own (meaning they have not be scratched up). The only thing I should think would keep someone from rebuying \\"Remain In Light\\" is the steep price, but if you know anything about Rhino, they have to do that in order to make money and to keep bringing us great remastered products like these from Talking Heads.

All thats come out of fifty cents music is stupid white kids fromt the suburbs thinking their gangsters an thugs which they aren't.

This should be in everybodys cd player.Such a wide variety here that it still sounds new even in 2006.Mike Patton, well what can you say about him his sobering to monstrous voice alone makes this album worth it. The rest of the band is right there with him too. Recommended tracks include Land of Sunshine, RV,Malpractice, Jizzlobber, Crack Hitler etc.This one never gets old, a breakthrough that has never been closely copied.One of my all time faves!!
B000BVD460|4.0|This album is not bad at all. I was suprised to see people rate it 1 or 2 stars. But I guess it's understandable, since some of these people don't even know how to spell \\"controversy\\" (hint: press control + f and search for \\"contreversy\\"). THe only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because not all the new songs are that great. But When I'm Gone is just so damn good. Eminem definately has some of his old sparks left in him. Well done.
B000C3H4L8|4.0|I'm not interested in whether this disc can play properly or not! Let's talk about the music here! As a debut, Talking Heads did a pretty good job. It's definitely one of their more sparse recordings and does not have many layers like their later work.<br /><br />The cd side is digitally remastered. So how does it compare to the old \\"'77\\" cd? A major improvement. However, there are no lyrics to the songs like on the old copy. There are liner notes from various musicians who appreciate Talking Heads as well as a note from Jerry Harrison about how he and Andy Zax remixed the album into 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />Which brings me to the dvd side. It's quite amazing to listen to \\"'77\\" through five speakers digitally remastered. You feel like you're in the studio with the band. The two bonus tracks are okay but nothing special. The two videos are okay. It's nice for someone like me to watch them since I missed the opportunity to see the band live. The 5.1 surround sound is excellent, but because this album is two dimensional sonically it doesn't quite compare with \\"Fear Of Music\\" or \\"Remain In Light\\".<br /><br />Okay, onto the music. As I said, this a good debut, but not great, and not their best work. It does contain the classic \\"Psycho Killer\\". It also has \\"No Compassion\\", \\"Uh-Oh, Love Comest To Town\\", \\"Tentative Decisions\\", \\"The Book I Read\\", \\"First Week/Last Week...Carefree\\" and \\"Pulled Up\\". In the bonus track department three tracks \\"Love --> Building On Fire\\", \\"I Wish You Wouldn't Say That\\" and \\"Sugar On My Tongue\\" all appeared on 1992's \\"Sand In The Vaseline\\". I particularly like \\"Sugar On My Tongue\\".<br /><br />For an album that came out nearly 30 years ago, \\"'77\\" holds up very well. Talking Heads were always ahead of their time and a true original. The digital remastering on the cd side is great, but you really need to listen to the dvd side and hear the album in 5.1 surround sound to be blown away. I'm a little annoyed by the expensive price tag to replace my old copy. I really think it should be $9.99, but then Rhino wouldn't make any money. If you really like the Talking Heads like I do, you will shell out the extra cash to get all eight albums digitally remastered.

0307276902|5.0|Poor Oprah.  She was embarassed.  ME ME ME ME.  I read this book on vacation in a day and a half and I could not put it down.  It is a memoir - based on the author's memories.  Not what Oprah wants them to be, her producers want them to be, nor his publisher.  Hasn't anybody ever read a book before that had names/dates/events changed to \\"protect the innocent.\\"  My advice is - if you want a riveting read, use your own mind and try this book. Do not be swayed by an over-hyped megalomaniac.
1401307450|1.0|And by that I mean truly unbelievable. The tales of excess and debauchery come across with little conviction and credibility. And after reading for the umpteenth time about Anthony `getting laid', `shooting up', `getting busted', etc, not only do the little yarns become somewhat tedious but one also starts to wonder if they indeed actually happened. So much so that even after the second attempt at reading this book I gave up altogether. <br /> <br />If you want read a good autobiographical account of people going over the edge in the music biz read The Dirt or Wonderland Avenue.  <br /> <br />Scar Tissue is badly written, has little story development and is altogether bland.  <br /> <br />Anthony should stick to what he knows best. <br /> <br />Avoid!
B000BVD460|2.0|Eminem Should Swing By His Self <br /> <br />The rap artist Eminem just released his new CD Curtain Call greatest hits. This is just another example of him losing his fire, which made him famous. It has a few of its old hits on it but a few new ones too. He's just a want to be Tupac and Dr. Dre but compared to their music he has no passion at all. They put their feelings out and really make emotions come out at the listeners. <br /> As you probably know there is some new tracks on the CD like when im gone. That song is the only decent song on there except for Stan which they bout show his feelings and how they come out. Lately they have been all a big laugh fest like he's trying to make the audience laugh, he has a lack of feeling in his newer songs. Unlike his old Cd's were he had anger to throw out and made his raps show that he still cares but once he sang just lose it, it started showing he had lost all his anger and he ran out of fuel to run on. If you like his older songs then I recommend a brand new artist named Ballistic he just came out with a new CD he's still small time and needs a little work on his lyrics but he has that anger from the streets. Also the most famous Tupac and Biggie Smalls both dead but have amazing talent and show their passion threw words. At last the old but famous N.W.A. including Snoop Dogg and many famous singers.  <br />  On Eminems CD there is a couple songs that still show emotions for instance Like Toy Solders, this song show his old ways of him bursting out with anger and saying how he feels. When I'm gone show his mad love for his daughter. Stan shows how his fans can get angry very fast and have real passion. When he doesn't have any passion in his music he should not write the song, maybe its his producers who push him so hard to write a song. But whoever it is need to stop. As time goes by I think that he just looses his anger but how could you hold it with large amounts of money and a huge house. <br /> Over all the CD was ok and not worth the 10.99$ and save your money for something you need not a passionless CD. <br />
B000C3H4M2|5.0|Talking Heads reached further into the multi-layered, polyphonic sounds with \\"Fear Of Music\\", and album truly ahead of its time. I dismiss the other reviews here complaining about this or that. The music is much better digitally remastered. The old cd copy is hollow, and this new remaster really brings the cd side to life, but again, if you really want to be transported to another place you must listen to the amazing 5.1 surround sound mix on the dvd side. \\"Fear Of Music\\" sounds fantastic in 5.1, and it reminds you that this is what 5.1 is all about.<br /><br />It helps that the music is perfect for this format. Such classics as \\"I Zimbra\\", \\"Mind\\", \\"Cities\\", \\"Life During Wartime\\", \\"Memories Can't Wait\\", \\"Air\\", \\"Heaven\\", \\"Animals\\" and \\"Drugs\\" come to life and breath anew. The dvd side has two live videos which are fine for those of us who haven't seen the Heads in concert. On the cd side there are four bonus tracks, three previously unreleased. \\"Dancing For Money\\" is interesting as an unfinished outtake. The alternate version of \\"Life During Wartime\\" doesn't improve the original. The alternate take of \\"Cities\\" is about the same as the original, just longer, same goes for the alternate take of \\"Mind\\".<br /><br />The booklet comes with comments by various popular musicians reminiscing about the Heads contributions to popular music. Jerry Harrison comments about the process of remixing the album into 5.1 surround sound which is interesting. There are no lyrics like the old cd copy had, which is an oversight in my opinion.<br /><br />All in all, ignore the old crones who are dismissing these remasters and the people who can't seem to get them to play. It's worth rebuying all of the remasters if you have proper equipment. The price is a bit steep, but the sound quality improvement is significant.
0385507755|5.0|This is a GREAT story - true or not doesn't matter.  It kept me glued through every page and quite honestly Mr. Frey is a brave man for putting it on paper.  I'm tired of the controversy and wish, for the author, that it would all just go away.  Do spend the time - for anyone who has known or is experiencing an addiction, directly or indirectly, you will completely relate to every word, thought and feeling.
B0000025KI|4.0|On \\"The River\\" Bruce is still sometimes seeking escape on songs like \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Out In The Street\\". But more often he now finds himself tethered to home, forced to confront his problems and accept his responsibilites. Though not as desperate and anguished as \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", this is still a fairly dark and somber album overall, as Springsteen's characters find themselves stuck in \\"Jackson Cage\\" and held back by \\"The Ties That Bind\\". But there is also a light at the end of the tunnel, as they seek redemption through faith, hope and love. The album's finest moment is definitely the title track, \\"The River\\" is a straight from the heart, soul stirrer that ranks among the very finest songs that Bruce has recorded.  <br /> <br />This album also has a somewhat more commerical sound, as apparently Bruce and the band were trying to reach a larger audience. They succeeded to some extent as \\"Hungry Heart was their biggest radio hit to date. But still what really weighs this album down is that there are just too many mediocre songs on it. If it had had been released as a single rather than a double LP, with filler like \\"Crush On You\\" and \\"I'm A Rocker\\" removed, it may have very well ranked among Springsteen's best work. As it is, it's still a good album and well worth owning. But you may want to use the \\"Skip\\" feature of your CD player more often than usual.
0385507755|5.0|Sorry Oprah, but we are not amused. First she raves the book and then she put the man in the frying pan... anything for ratings. Please, poor man. People this is a good book and you just forget about the smallness thats been made into a media frenzy by Godzioprahilla. Kudos, for Frey and next time be sure to say that it is based on facts and dont let anyone with enough money to use you to tell you or use you other wise. Buy the book.
B00005JOFO|5.0|First, let me say that this movie moved me in a way I didn't think was possible.  It reminded me of when I was 15 and saw Grave of the Fireflies for the first time, after which I bawled for hours.   <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain is a modern Greek tragedy.  There is the rise and fall of characters, the conflict between duty and desire, the pathos and the carthatic ending.  With all of these elements are an absolutely amazing cast, particularly Heath Ledger, whom I never have cared for and now respect greatly.  The passion between Jack and Ennis moves from understated and sensuous to fiery and palpable.  The instrumental score is gorgeous--truly full of heart. <br /> <br />And the best part?  The dialogue and action are practically word for word from the original story.  The only difference is the added scenes, which stem from references the characters make in the stories (birth of a son, Mexico trip, etc.).  Annie Proulx writes on her website that she feels lucky to have her story adapted so beautifully. <br /> <br />A lot of guys I know won't go because they feel their masculinity is threatened.  Our illustrious President will not comment on the movie.  <br /> <br />They are wrong. <br /> <br />This is a stunning, gritty, beautiful, moving film.  It's amazing what Ang Lee has done, how bold yet delicate the love story is--how realistic--how tragic.  How human.
0307276902|4.0|even though james frey fictionalized much of the book, it's still a good read.  i must say, everyone who wants their money back is just being ridiculous.  if you paid for the book and read it, it's yours. <br /> <br />the story is still powerful and interesting.  it's still powerful.  and, even though most people seem to have forgotten this, the man was a really messed up addict.  some details are going to be fuzzy to him...and some details are going to be changed b/c of defense mechanisms. <br /> <br />just give it a chance...you won't be able to put it down.
B000301YY8|5.0|This CD has been a great find, and I've had tracks on \\"repeat 1\\" all day long. \\"You're beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye my lover\\" are especially well done.  <br /> <br />The music has a haunting, but beautiful sound.  <br /> <br />Get this CD, you won't regret it if you are a fan of the thoughtful alterna rock scene.
6300214028|5.0|I saw this film when it first played at the Regency 1 Theatre in San Francisco in 1981.  I was gratified when Warren Beatty won the Oscar for his work, but I was disappointed the film was not more universally praised and appreciated.  Having spent several weeks in the Soviet Union upon graduating from college in 1967, I was stunned by both the historical detail as well as the emotional power of the film.  We visited John Reed's place on the Kremlin wall, and we discussed aspects of his push for the acceptance of his beliefs in America.  (I was on a college tour for credit -- Political Science and/or Art History -- of most of Europe at the time.)  It seems unfortunate that this aspect of American history is not more universally understood and appreciated.  It is both important and topical, considering all of the media coverage and discussion regarding our current president's use of Executive Privilege masked as \\"within the legal limits of the office\\" to give authority for surveillance of the citizenry.  It is interesting to compare the ideology of John Reed with the current political climate.  As a gay man concerned with our own equal rights quest, it's great to view the quest of another man somewhat outside the mainstream.  I can only wish someone at the studio which released this film would wake up and give it a full, complete and extended release on DVD.  IT IS QUITE LONG OVERDUE! ! !  Perhaps, Mr. Beatty is paying attention, and he will push for a proper remastering and release on DVD.  It is a great film -- one of significance and with enormous emotional power.  It also has an engaging and evocative musical score.  IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED.   <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|No film has ever impressed me with the hardships of war that an infantryman faces the way this one did.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a miniseries tracing E Co. of the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the storied 101st Airborne Division from basic training, to the D-Day jump, through the fighting at the Battle of the Bulge and on into Germany.  This is a great and true story which is based upon, and closely follows the book by Stephen Ambrose of the same title.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" is very possibly the most accurate story ever told about what it was like to be an elite American infantryman in combat during the Second World War in Europe.  The direction and scenes in the film are extraordinary and really seem to capture the noise, confusion, and fear that all soldiers feel and suffer in combat.  The uniforms and lingo of the soldiers seem very authentic.<br /><br />The story has its fast-paced portions and its slower portions, like most miniseries.  This film is best enjoyed by a viewer in a thoughtful mood who is not looking for a slam-bang action flick with a quick and satisfying ending.  This film is based on real life incidents within E Co., and of course real life rarely tracks the formulaic Hollywood good v. evil themes leading to a happy ending.<br /><br />The film has too many excellent episodes to begin to list them all.  My favorite is near the end; the episode \\"Why We Fight.\\"  Germany is collapsing, and the American Army is deep within that country.  The scenes depicting the defeated, surrendered German Army soldiers looked incredibly authentic.  As did those showing the concentration camp which E Co. stumbled into.<br /><br />The DVD reproduction is crisp and clear, with vivid colors which nevertheless seem to have a subtle 1940s tint.<br /><br />America can be proud of producing soldiers like those of the 101st Airborne Division, and I do not think that it is saying too much to say that this miniseries does the 101st justice.  That is high praise indeed.is high praise indeed.
B000002I6X|4.0|Though he never achieved any of the heights that his ex-Buffalo Springfield partner Neil Young did, Stephen Stills did manage to put out two fine albums (this and the double-barreled Manassass). A fine collection, highlighted by Fishes & Scorpions, Nothin' to do But today, Change Partners and (especially) the righteous fury of Word Game, a stripped-down acoustic tune with angry lyrics that resulted in a rather strange dream of mine, in which this song was about a crossword puzzle. Anyhoo, also good is Bluebird Revisited, though the Buffalo Springfield original is a must-hear. Also worthy is his dark acoustic tune, Know You've Got to Run, which quotes from CSNY's Everybody I Love You, and the Ecology Song, though the horns are a bit much. Though there are lesser tunes (Marrianne, Singin' Call), if you like Neil Young, CSNY/CSN, or the singer/songwriter subgenre in general, go with Stephen Stills.
0307276902|1.0|Any addict can tell you that one of the first casualties of addiction is the truth.  In this case, that is the only thing we can be sure that James Frey has in common with people fighting addiction is the lying.  But where recovering addicts realize that they must work to avoid the lies that help cover or enable their addiction, Frey has embraced the lying with open arms, profiting from it to the tune of millions.  This is _not_ an example to be held up for people who have real struggles with addiction.  It is a lie, a lie done with intent to exploit the suffering of others and to profit from that exploitation.  I hope everyone who purchased a copy of this book will demand their money back on the grounds of deceptive advertising.<br /><br />In addition, the publisher, Nan Talese, who continues to back Frey, should apologize to everyone who was deceived into believing that this book was factual, apologize to her fellow publishers for bringing discredit to the profession, and then quit the business entirely.
0684824906|5.0|Just when you think you've heard it all.  This book is amazing analysis of Lincoln's characteristics.  I couldn't stop turning the pages.  It is that little reminder that you should never give up.  Lincoln was an amazing man.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Though I do like Mezmerize, it didn't enthrall me as much as this album.  The track 'Hyptonize' is just a great single, really nice balance of the two vocals.  Unlike some of the reviewers, i actually really liked their opening song \\"Attack\\", it gives great energy for the rest of the album.  I also love \\"Dreaming\\", probably on of my favorite tracks.  They are able to maintain their sillyness, sometimes even irony, which they do a great job to show their fun side.  i mean, u really can make a song just about anything!  Also make sure to check out \\"Soldier Side\\", its quite emotional.  this was a more complete album than Mezmerize, but check out that one too!  It has a different feel to it
B00005JOGU|5.0|In 1959, Truman Capote (Hoffman), an author at the time best known for \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", read about the murder of the Clutter family in Kansas.  He decided to investigate the four murders for a non-fiction article, having grown tired of writing fiction.  He takes his good friend, Nell Harper Lee (Keener), and heads to Kansas.  The police chief reluctantly cooperates with themandsoon Capote is interviewing Perry Smith (Collins) and Richard Hickock (Pellingrino).  Capote and Perry form a bond of sorts, both using the other to their own benefit.  Capote even observes, \\"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house.  One day, I went out the front door and he went out the back.\\"  Their bond becomes torment for Capote, and he soon finds himself wishing for it all to be over.<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" is an absolutely fascinating film about one of America's most well known authors, and gives an in-depth look in to the writing of his masterwork, \\"In Cold Blood\\".  Philip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding as the title character, throwing all of himself into the role.  This movie is his, and he owns every scene.  If he does not win an Oscar for his performance, it will be a crime.  Supporting actors Catherine Keener and Chris Cooper, as well ast Clifton Collins, Jr. also give solid performances that make this film gripping.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is only in limited release, and has been since September 2005, but I highly recommend searching it out.
0307276902|5.0|Listen people: This is a great book. It's well written, and it's affected everyone who has read it. I don't understand the controversy over whether or not it's true. It's a book. When James Frey was on Oprah the first time, he said it was based on his life. It's not supposed to be an autobiography or a news story. Whatever happened to allowing for artistic license? Who are these people going on about how it's not 100% true? This book can still save lives.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book before James Frey was recently exposed as the liar that he is.  So during my reading, I loved the book.  I could relate.  Yes - there were several times where I read something that he claimed happened to him and I thought, \\"no way would that have happened\\" (like the first part of the book where he is somehow allowed onto a commercial airline flight drunk &/or drugged out of his mind and with a broken & bleeding nose, broken front teeth, and a gaping & bleeding hole in his cheek), but I was taken in and I read the whole book in just a couple of evenings. <br /> <br />Then...  I came across the smoking gun's expose of the fact that James Frey is a big fat liar.  Although this doesn't change my enjoyment of the book, it pisses me off because the book was respresented & promoted as a true account of his life.  Instead, it is a work of fiction loosely based on Frey's life.  I'm not sure I would have even read the book if it had been promoted as a work of fiction.  A huge part of the reason I enjoyed it was because I BELIEVED. <br /> <br />Ok, so I'm partly pissed off because I've been duped.  But there is also an issue of principle here. <br /> <br />So Mr Frey, I believe you & your publisher should provide a means for refunding the money to any buyer of your book who wants their money back. <br /> <br />For those readers who don't care whether it was fiction or truth, that's totally your choice.  I can understand that for some people this won't matter at all.  But if you're reading these reviews to try to determine whether or not to buy/read this book, consider in advance that it's really just a work of fiction - perhaps that's what you're looking for, and perhaps it isn't. <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Definitely the best work of Foo fighters, since they became a rock band.!!<br /><br />Dave Grohl's band after 3 years without a release finally shows a little spirit of Nirvana's days...<br /><br />I can say that this LP is even better from the most known albums of Nirvana, and why not.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Best of You\\", will be rock anthems in the future. I love this song, everything on it is perfect, Lyrics, Vocals, Chorus, Guitar, Drums, everything...<br /><br />I really can't understand why they decided to make an acoustic Disc 2 with slow ballads, the only good from there is \\"Miracle\\", and maybe another 1 or 2 songs.<br /><br />Even though, their singles were great, with the leading song Best of you making the difference, it became 2x Platinum in US, for 400.000 downloads.<br />DOA, the second single in US, and Resolve the second single in Europe were another 2 successful singles, then No Way Back, the third single in US was No.2 on Modern Rock Chart and No.6 on Mainstream Rock Chart, and now their latest single Miracle is maybe their last single from this LP.<br /><br />Well Done guys...
B0001ZX204|4.0|This release is the 2004 (Japanese, I think) import. If you're looking for the US release of The Very Best of Kiss and stumbled in here somehow...back out and try again. There is no need to pay over $30 for this release when the US release is readily available here at Amazon for about $10. All indications suggest that there is no difference between the import and the US release other than some Asian writing on the disk.<br /><br />As far as the music on this disk goes...<br /><br />You wanted the best and with this CD you almost get all of the best. The great misnomer associated with Kiss is that they \\"are all about the theatrics, they are posers and can't really make good music.\\" Well this CD proves quite simply that nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />In my review of Kiss' 2005 Rock the Nation DVD I said, \\"This DVD dispels the myth that Kiss were ever posers. They indeed were always great musicians and they were the inspiration for many metal bands rocking your world today.\\"<br /><br />In Kiss' The Very Best of Kiss, you get most of the songs that will go down in Kisstory as really making an impression on the world of rock. I'm sure that many who doubt that Kiss made a big impression on the world of rock would be surprised that some of today's bands that they think are superior were actually inspired by Kiss. Over the years Kiss have been in and Kiss have been out. But the bottom line is that behind the make-up and behind the awesome stage show you had a group of guys that wrote a stable full of songs that rock.<br /><br />The songs are good. You can understand all of the lyrics (unlike some of today's hard rockers that sound like the Devil himself is at the mic, i.e. Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel and the like), Kiss' melodies are pure rock and you get a great live show to boot.<br /><br />On this disk you get:<br /><br />1. Strutter<br /><br />2. Deuce<br /><br />3. Got To Choose<br /><br />4. Hotter Than Hell<br /><br />5. C`Mon And Love Me<br /><br />6. Rock And Roll All Nite<br /><br />7. Detroit Rock City<br /><br />8. Shout It Out Loud<br /><br />9. Beth<br /><br />10. I Want You<br /><br />11. Calling Dr. Love<br /><br />12. Hard Luck Woman<br /><br />13. I Stole Your Love<br /><br />14. Christine Sixteen<br /><br />15. Love Gun<br /><br />16. New York Groove<br /><br />17. I Was Made For Loving You<br /><br />18. I Love It Loud<br /><br />19. Lick It Up<br /><br />20. Forever<br /><br />21. God Gave Rock `N` Roll To You II<br /><br />Clearly missing from this CD are Makin Love, She, Love Her All I Can and most notably Parasite.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2006 and Kiss still have it together...going strong since the early 70s. Need proof? Check out their 2005 DVD release, \\"Rock the Nation\\". The DVD is awesome (see my 5 star review of Rock the Nation). The DVD has none of the wimpy Beth/Hard Luck Woman/Forever ballads, and it makes up for the missing songs on the CD. PLUS you get to see the great music performed in a sensational show. On the DVD you get:<br /><br />1. Love Gun<br /><br />2. Deuce<br /><br />3. Makin' Love<br /><br />4. Lick It Up<br /><br />5. Christine Sixteen<br /><br />6. She<br /><br />7. Tears Are Falling<br /><br />8. Got To Choose<br /><br />9. I Love It Loud<br /><br />10. Love Her All I Can<br /><br />11. I Want You<br /><br />12. Parasite<br /><br />13. War Machine<br /><br />14. 100,000 Years<br /><br />15. Unholy<br /><br />16. Shout It Out Loud<br /><br />17. I Was Made For Lovin' You<br /><br />18. Detroit Rock City<br /><br />19. God Gave Rock & Roll to You II<br /><br />20. Rock and Roll All Nite<br /><br />Unfortunately, missing from the DVD are Strutter, Hotter Than Hell, C'mon and Love Me and I Stole Your Love.<br /><br />Anyway, The Very Best of Kiss CD is a must if you haven't updated your vinyl to CD and you don't want to buy all of the individual early disks. And the Rock the Nation DVD should not be passed on if you are or ever were a Kiss fan. Got to Choose? Noway! Buy 'em both, but go for the US release of the CD.
0525948023|5.0|A NEW EARTH continues the important teaching first brought forward in THE POWER OF NOW. Its message is a light that effortlessly dissolves the darkness and confusion peddled by our corporate religions and established psychologies. Much like the works of OSHO, the writing is simple, straightforward, and genuinely healing. The book says \\"Yes\\" to life, and gives to the reader the priceless gift of hope. Written with courage and clarity, A NEW EARTH is the finest of books. Eckhart's insight into life and mind touches that intuitive part of us that proclaims, \\"This is it. This is the truth.\\"
0307276902|2.0|I, too, feel \\"duped\\" by James. I read the book before Oprah put her brand on it, and I was blown away. I was also shocked when she picked it, as it doesn't quite fit with her usual selections.  <br /> <br />I love that he had the guts to own up to his mistake, but he still came out ahead. He made a ton of money on his fabrications. Sadly, this will only cause people to buy his book more to determine was was truth and what was fiction. Save your money!
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I couldn't believe radio was playing a song as different as Bat Country...when I heard it, I ran out and bought the albumn. Upon first listen I thought some stuff was a little over the top, but now I can not stop listening. The riffs are in my head and will not come out...good stuff
B00006CXSS|5.0|this story of one rifle company during d-day and beyond is the finest world war II film and maybe the best war film ever made. this hbo miniseries pulls no punches as it tells the story of real heros of the war, the guys who had to spend everyday in the hell of combat and what it did to them. no glamor here just men or really boys saving the world and wanting to get home in one piece. you will never find a better story of war and the boys who have to fight. it belongs in everyones collection, and in a place of honor in the american list of great films. please check this fine film out, you won't be sorry.
B00000K19E|4.0|The Matrix was an enormously popular film.  While it would seem to be a rather monochromatic, brooding, recycled work of science fiction, its popularity will lie in its extraordinary visual effects, and a theme which resonated strongly with a generation.  <br /> <br />The title is taken from \\"The Matrix\\", which represents the world in which we presently live.  However, its inhabitants do not really exist in this world.  Rather, in the words of Morpheus, this world represents \\"a neural-interactive simulation that we call The Matrix\\".  While this world's inhabitants experience the simulation as though it were real, their real essences -- with the exception of a few -- are being tapped to power the simulation.  By implication, as a person's essence is drained from them, so is the simulation kept alive.   <br /> <br />Several issues recur in the film, and it is on these I shall focus here, rather than the more superficial progression of the plot.  The perspectives are characteristically postmodern:  <br /> <br />The film would suggest that the true nature of reality is such that it lies beyond decipherment.  Cypher states:  \\"There's way too much information to decode the Matrix.\\"  At first, when humans sought to impose an incomplete system on their world, they \\"marvelled at our own magnificence\\".  Yet these human constructions led to the loss of dignity and freedom, \\"a race of machines\\".  The artificiality of \\"the construct\\" led, in turn, to a sense of alienation among humans.  Trinity says to Neo:  \\"I know why you hardly sleep, and why night after night you sit at your computer.\\"   The film raises several other issues:  the arbitrary nature of identity -- \\"from clothing to equipment, weapons, training simulation, anything we need\\";  the question of \\"misery and suffering\\" -- conjecturing that this might enable human beings to \\"define their reality\\";  the concern that human beings are \\"a cancer of this planet\\";  and an apparent fixation with determinism, or fate.  In thewords of Neo:  \\"I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.\\"   <br /> <br />The film makes a few attempts to answer the conundrums of the human condition:   <br /> <br />It would suggest that we are capable of recognising our enslavement to the Matrix.  There is a reality beyond this world, \\"a world without rules and controls.\\"  The door is there -- you only \\"have to walk through it\\".  However, it is a one-way door.  \\"I can't go back, can I,\\" says Neo.  That is, the post- phenomenon is not just a fad.  Not only this, but we would appear to have a mission to destroy the Matrix -- hence, apparently, much of the violence of the film (it has an R rating in the USA).  Morpheus explains:  \\"The Matrix . . . is our enemy.\\"  The ultimate answer to life is tentatively suggested as lying beyond system and reason.  There is a difference between \\"knowing\\" and \\"walking\\" the path, explains Trinity -- and in the closing scenes, she says to Neo:  \\"If you're killed in the Matrix, your body cannot live without the mind.\\"  Neo, however, continues to live despite this, apparently through the power of love:  \\"Because I LOVE you!\\" <br /> <br />At the end of the film, Neo Anderson (tr. new man) is returned to his original environment, after having discovered the true nature of the Matrix -- yet now he looks around him apparently renewed.  Finally he looks up, and takes to the skies like Superman.  Is Neo truly a renewed man?  Does he truly possess new possibilities?  Where do we go from here?  After all, only Superman can fly.  Among his closing words are these:  \\"I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.  I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.\\"
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I think this cd is excellant.[...] Stevie Ray Vaughan would be the closest comparison I can see from this cd, and that's really saying something.... Thank goodness someone out there can still play the guitar!
1400031087|1.0|Read this book as fiction, for that's what it is. If you want to read a real memoir, read \\"The Glass Castle: A Memoir\\" by Jeannette Walls.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Boy has Martin lost his way. The script and story is low brow a' la \\"Titantic\\" and worst of all it shares the same leading man. The sets and costumes and all the CGI are state of the art, the blood explodes from every inflicted wound regardless if it induced by gun, cannon, hatchet or knife. Still the plot is plotless during the few minutes of non violence, correction, just about every conversation in this movie is drenched in the threat of some form of violence.  There is a \\"Dickensesque\\" story line of a son plotting to kill his fathers' killer.  Somewhere along the way pick pocket Diaz enters the story just to have a female character basically, her acting and character serve no purpose. Finally at the end of this long disaster the movie erupts into a city wide riot against the Civil War draft.  This is only to set the background for the battle of the titans showdown between the gang leaders. Daniel Day Lewis does his best Robert Deniro impersonation  throughout, what a ham. I can't honestly say enough to warn anyone that hasn't lost two plus hours of their lives to stay away from this horrifci movie.  Rent of buy \\"the Warrior\\" if you want to see how it should be done.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Ang Lee has done it again. This beautiful movie is so well crafted that the sex of the two lovers is irrelevant,their need for each other is ever-present and sensitively expressed. Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall are absolute perfection as the two men who commit to each other in their own fashion and live the rest of their days recapturing the magic moment on Brokeback Mountain. The wives of the characters, particularly Michelle Williams are outstanding as providing a reality check/counterfoil to Ennis and Jack. <br /> <br />A totally enjoyable, rewarding cinematic experience. Can't wait for it to be released onto DVD.
B000003S16|5.0|This is my favorite of the solo works of Fripp because he balances well the prog influences and the  rock n roll 3 minute capsules in a very intelligent way (and quite entertaining i might add). In many ways this preludes the 'discipline' Crimsom album with , for example, one of the singers sounding like Adrian Belew. But some of the best moments here belong to Peter Hammil who is just totally crazy in these tracks. A great cd , and a shame it is out of print.
0553801503|2.0|I am such a huge fan of the series and plowed through the first 3 books. I couldn't put them down. After the long patient wait for Feast For Crows I find myself very disappointed. It doesn't even come close to the excitment the previous books put you through. But, Alas, it is a must read regardless (if your a fan of the series). Just drink LOTS of coffee, finish it & pray the next book is back on track & is released a little sooner than 5 years! 5 years???
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I have to say that I am rarely blown away by a cd.  With that said, this album whipped my ass into submission and became without a doubt my favorite cd, ever.  Shadows' amazing growls and lyrical power, Synyster's incredible solos, Zacky's pace-keeping riffing, Johnny's thunderous bass skills, and The Rev's dominating drum lines combine to make some of the best music you will ever hear. <br /> <br />1.  Waking the Fallen  8/10 <br />Hands down the best intro you will ever hear (if you want to even call it that).  This sets the pace for the cd. <br /> <br />2.  Unholy Confessions  8/10 <br />This is the title's most accessible tune.  Extremely catchy (especially that opening riff), this is the song that hooks the listeners, and it isn't even the best song. <br /> <br />3.  Chapter Four  9/10 <br />This is where Shadows shows his best singing abilities.  This song will become one of your favorite songs, guaranteed. <br /> <br />4.  Reminissions  7.5/10 <br />Good song, but nothing to write home about.  Nice guitar work (but that basically applies to every song).  Not bad. <br /> <br />5.  Desecrate Through Reverance  10/10 <br />This is my favorite song on the cd, at least tied for first.  You really do have to hear this song to understand, it's pretty hard to expalin how great this song is. <br /> <br />6.  Eternal Rest  8.5/10 <br />Wow.  The guitar solo at the beginning of this song will make your ears bleed, but you'll love every second of it.  Kick ass song. <br /> <br />7.  Second Heartbeat  9/10 <br />This song has some of the prettiest guitar passages I've heard.  Spectacular. <br /> <br />8.  Radient Eclipse 8/10 <br />Pretty damn good song, but I never got into this one much.  Worth a listen for sure. <br /> <br />9.  I Won't See You Tonight Part 1  9.5/10 <br />One word, ballad.  Whoa whoa whoa wait, here's another word, epic.  A7X justifies the use of piano in heavy music with this song, period. <br /> <br />10. I Won't See You Tonight Part 2  10/10 <br />This is the complete opposite to Part 1.  It's also arguably the hardest song on the cd.  This is tied for my favorite as well.  The solo in this song absolutely wicked.  A must listen. <br /> <br />11.  Clairvoyent Disease  7/10 <br />Don't get me wrong, this is a decent song.  However, it really isn't up to par with the first 10 songs. <br /> <br />12.  And All Things Will End  6.5/10 <br />See the review for Clairvoyent Disease... <br /> <br /> <br />Buy this cd now.  Seriously.
0385507755|5.0|The fact that this book may be part fiction, or even wholly fiction, changes nothing about this harrowing, inspiring piece of literature. <br /> <br />Novels have always been more honest than memoirs anyway. Most serious readers recognize this already. And those who make such a clear distinction between non-fiction and fiction have never understood the nature or power of the written word. <br /> <br />The fact that James Frey is now ensnared in Oprah's web of moral hypocrisy, and now must feel the wrath of Queen Winfrey and her hordes of ditto-head clones, is at least partly his fault for aligning himself with her and that horrible cliche of a book club.  <br /> <br />However, he can always take comfort in the fact that, no matter how many factual inaccuracies he has in his book, he'll never be as fake as Oprah.
0307276902|1.0|This shows how easily the fake can be marketed more easily than the genuine. From the editorial reviews right on down, a total fantasy. And Oprah is right in there: first with the marketing, then with the attack . . . laughing all the way to the bank.
0446691437|5.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet--this book is a short and pithy kick in the butt that is sure to motivate your inner entrepreneur/artist/mother/etc to stopping avoiding the life God has intended for you and to ACT! Action is the surest antidote to fear and depression, I learned in this book, and creativity blossoms when you pay your dues and sit down daily to do your work.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|This is the new reissue with extra tracks (check the release date). Great stuff, too -- Stills' pre-solo album version of Do For The Others is terrific, as is the rendition of Everybody's Talkin'. This version of Song with No Words was on the box set (not sure if it's exactly the same, but it's the same recording), but it's pretty great stuff. The demo of Teach Your Children is awfully nice, too. Apparently, in about '69 or '70, every time these guys picked up a guitar and started to sing, it was pretty special. Of course, the original album is a stone classic, one of the best albums ever. It just has a quality to it that you can't exactly put your finger on. Every track just glows. If you don't have this album, you should probably buy it. If you have it, you're probably a fan, and I'd recommend this version just for the extra tracks.
0385507755|5.0|Okay, we've all heard the hype.  But putting all that aside - this is one of the best books I have read.  Whether it's all true, half true or not true at all.  James Frey is a great author and he wrote a book that I could not put down until I was finished and then I still wanted more.  Maybe it should have been \\"based on a true story\\" instead of a \\"memoir\\" but it was still a great book.  A must read.
B000A2GTNK|5.0|I did notice that there is a bit of a proggier feel to Warriors on the Edge of Time (1975), especially in contrast to earlier efforts such as In Search of Space (1971), and musically appears to continue the format of Hall of the Mountain Grill (1974). The lineup on this album is similar to that on Hall of the Mountain Drill, with the exception of the subtraction of keyboardist Del Dettmar, and the addition of drummer/percussionist Allen Powell along with vocalist/sci-fi author Michael Moorcock. Busted for possession of drugs while on tour, Lemmy was arrested and subsequently fired by the band. As such, this was Lemmy's last album with Hawkwind before he went on to form Motorhead.<br /><br />This great album of space rock opens with the approximately 10'30\\" minute Assault and Battery>The Golden Void, which is ushered in with the pounding, chugging, Rickenbacker bass work of Lemmy, while keyboardist/violinist Simon House establishes swirling clouds of spacey mellotron pads. The rest of the band then joins in with the heavy, straight and double drumming of Simon King/Allan Powell \\"cutting through the clouds\\", along with the \\"rough around the edges\\" vocal style of guitarist Dave Brock and great flute work by Nik Turner. This combination of spacey synthesizer textures (at times it reminds me of Tim Blake's work with Gong), tons of mellotron, sometimes distorted electric guitar, and a thunderous rhythm section pretty much characterizes most of the album.<br /><br />The odd pieces Standing at the Edge, Warriors, and The Wizard Blows his Horn each feature a heavily echoed and electronically altered spoken word passage and present a stark contrast to the rest of the material. The Wizard Blows his Horn describes hissing \\"snow snakes\\" and other strange imagery, which segues into my favorite track, Opa-Loka. This piece is hypnotic, trance-like, and features a repeated phrase on the bass, which is doubled by the snare and bass drum. On top of this pulsating rhythm section are odd electronic effects generated with the moog, heavily echoed guitars parts, and scattered bits played on various woodwind and reed instruments by Nik Turner. Haunting melodies and spacey mellotron/synth work are featured on the Demented Man in addition to a wonderful acoustic guitar part, making this another favorite track along with the propulsive and synth heavy Spiral Galaxy 28948.<br /><br />The only straight ahead and rocking tune on the CD is the reckless and comparatively \\"garage-rock-like\\" sounding track Kings of Speed, which features a great violin solo by Simon King.<br /><br />The bonus tracks include Motorhead, which spotlights the bludgeoning bass playing of Lemmy along with some ear splitting guitar work by Dave Brock and an explosive live version of Kings of Speed.<br /><br />This remastered version by the German Rock Fever label is pretty shoddy and does not feature much in the way of extras.<br /><br />This is a fantastic album of space rock that presents a nice blend of spacey synth textures, electronic experimentation, electric/acoustic guitar work, and a bone-crunching rhythm section. Highly recommended along with Hawkwind (1970) and Hall of the Mountain Grill (1974).ffects generated with the moog, heavily echoed guitars parts, and scattered bits played on various woodwind and reed instruments by Nik Turner.

B00070Q8DQ|2.0|I dont see how people can call this epic or one of the best releases of the year.  I find the album to be boring.  The overdubbing of the vocals just ruins the music; not that the music is anything to rave about.  I would say that this album, and the newest Nile album, Annihilation of the Wicked are the two most over-hyped death metal albums of 2005<br /><br />Instead of picking this up, I would get older Morbid Angel or Severe Torture.
B000003TA4|5.0|If you don't \\"get\\" the record it doesn't mean it's no good. It just means that you missed the most important band in rock history since Led Zeppelin. That's ok though. I wouldn't try to act like I dig the sixtys (although I can appreciate sixtys music), so why should anyone act like they understand the transformation that rock went through in the early ninetys? I mean, one minute we're listening to \\"She's my Cherry Pie\\" and the next we're hearing Kurt screaming \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". Quite a shock to the system, and it changed everything. I can't say that I disagree that nu-metal is the devil, and the worst thing since disco, but they aren't even close relatives to Nirvana- please don't make that mistake. It's cool to read that so many new listeners like Nirvana's music...welcome home! But if you don't get it then that's a shame. You should have been there. <br /> <br />
B000002J1Y|4.0|This was one of my first Yes experiences. I had been a Bruford fan for some time, and I knew that he drummed for some of these tracks. I found, however, that Bruford was the drummer for only two of the tracks. The rest was done by none other than Alan White.  <br />At face value, I was sorely disappointed. Once I gave it a listen, I was not too sad. This may be a bold statement, but I almost enjoyed \\"Roundabout\\" better this way. Bruford sounded very precise on the studio cut, and very tasteful, don't get me wrong. Alan White's drumming seemed to be more projectory, and lively; coming in on the ride cymbal instead of the hihats made it sound huge!  <br />The best track does involve he that is Bill Bruford, and that is \\"Perpetual Change\\". The song as a whole; great music, great solos, but most importantly, great melody. The chorus of the song is extremely beautiful. <br />By far, one of the best live performances I have heard.
0385507755|5.0|I read this book last August. I almost didn't buy it BECAUSE it was an Oprah Book of the Month pick. Any book I've read previously that has happened to be part of her Book Club list, were all pretty terrible reads (I don't know all the books on that she's ever had...I'm talking about books like Where the Heart Is and some other forgettable junk.) But this one, though not a shining example of writing at its best, is full of heart. It's full of the anger, frustration, desperation, feel like your soul is bleeding emotion that comes when confronting recovery and battling your demons - addiction. I have something to say to Oprah regarding the Truth -- if Truth is really what's so important to you, then where are all the government officials, members of Bush's administration, Bush, himself, that should be seated on your couch defending their lies or mistakes or whatever propaganda BS they wish to use to defend their see-through imperialist agenda?? Huh Oprah, where are they? Oh I forgot you'd rather be surrounded by your idol worshipping followers and fellow \\"in great need of a reality check\\" celeb friends...Hey Oprah if you're so about the Truth, then why aren't you in Iraq, checking out the truth, in Palestine, checking out the Truth, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Darfur, Sudan...Oprah is a joke just like the rest of Hollywood.
B000BWI9U0|1.0|Angst is so played.  I had to blast \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" to get the taste of Stroke outta my mouth.
6302482585|5.0|As time goes by, this remains for many people the greatest movie ever made. Start with one of the greatest, if not the greatest actors ever, in his best screen role as Rick. In addition to Bogart, throw in a perefectly cast Ingrid Bergman. Then back it up with a suspenseful and exciting script with one of the best supporting casts ever put together. Very special mention has to go out to Claude Rains as Louie. Louie is given many great lines but Raines makes them more special with his performance. \\"Major Strasser has been shot.( Long pause- roll eyes -look about) Round up the usual subjects.\\" A great line made even better by the way in which it's delivered.   Greenstreet is also perfect as is Lorre. Throw in an Academy Award winning song and that is how you get to the best movie ever made. I hope younger audiences find this great movie.
B0001HAISQ|3.0|The following review is repeated for the FULL screen DVD.  The sound wasn't any better.  Everyone else that didn't mention this in their reviews must be deaf. <br />      <br />\\"Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star, that's why I gave it a '3 star':\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I was impressed with the movie - Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan - just a little dickens of a \\"lady-killer\\", devilish sweet smile - but NOT with the SOUND. The sound engineers, or SOMEONE, messed with it. When it started to be loud - the music to show excitement - THEY (the sound engineers, or SOMEONE) TURNED IT DOWN. Same with any yelling (excitement), by the children, the pirates, or Hook.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"VERY disappointing! I'LL control my sound thank-you-very-much!\\"  <br /> <br />The sound engineers should be VERY ashamed that they allowed this to go out like this!!!  I am certainly EXTREMELY surprised, considering the MEGA sound engineers that were used on this film!  Shame! on you for being so lazy.
0743454537|4.0|I was instantly drawn by the provocative hook and wondered if Picoult could possibly live up to such compelling promise. In many ways, my expectations were far exceeded. The writing, in general, is evocative, rich and atmospheric, with the sole exception of dialogue, which I found uniformly weak.    The two-dimensional legal drama and romantic subplot was a serious detraction from the remainder of this moving family saga.    All in all, however, this was an exceptionally worthwhile read. Contrary to some of the other posted reviews, I didn't love the facile trick-wrist ending, but I didn't hate it either.
B00005JOII|2.0|The only thing that saves this film from a zero or one-star rating is the cast.  The screenplay on this thing is, to say the least, clunky.  Some of the dialog is barely palatable and I don't know how the actors managed to wrap their tongues around it without laughing out loud.  The set-up for Chris's \\"perfect crime\\" is blatant:  \\"The woman down the hall had a burglery earlier...\\" and, since it's Woody Allen, you KNOW he's going to get away with it.
0307276902|5.0|I thought that yesterdays Oprah was a disgrace. They attacked James in such a way that he couldn't even answer questions. What people need to know is that Memoirs are a recalling of events in someones life they way they recall it. Being the wife of a recovering addict, I have some insight. Most people including Oprah are cluess when it comes to addiction, and recovery. Lies and deceit are a hugh part of an addicts illness, and the truth in general becomes very hazy. James probably wrote this book based on how he remembered that time in his life. HOW HE SAW IT! He also had a story that needed to be told. If that meant making it a little more shocking...well it was worth it to get the word out. Hang  in there James. You have gotten through worse, and come out a better person! My husband and I loved both books, and felt some relief that  maybe some other people would learn about addiction and recovery. That was the one thing we felt when we went through it ourselves....how niave is the world and the people that live in it. Judgemental with out the facts! Way to go James,keep holding on!
B000002H70|5.0|A great party album, great for just about any occasion, except weddings, maybe after a couple gets a divorce you can give it to the guy, that way he goes out and gets married again.<br /><br />Just kidding, I really loved the album, and I think that if you are trying to get to sleep, you should listen to it.  I told my friend to hear it while I was at my computer, but he didn't like it at first, let him borrow it for the evening.  He called me in the morning and said that he loved it as well, I haven't received my CD back from him.<br /><br />Great for couples, especially goth couples, great bedroom music, sets the mood, don't believe me?  Date any girl and try it, if she doesn't like it, dump her, she's selfish.
B00005JLSE|5.0|In response to your review, i don't think that this movie is setting a bad example. Anyone with more than half a brain can see that there are consequences for committing crimes, even in this movie, and can tell the difference between right and wrong! Any husand or boyfriend who goes to see this with his wife or girlfriend just has to take it with good humor. It's only a movie!  <br />Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere AND Rene Zelwegger are all good actors, no matter how much plastic surgury any of them have had, and deseve recognition for their performances. It's not easy getting up there and snging and dancing, especially if it's good!  <br />This movie has morals and is trying to teach something, which you would know if you had been paying attention when you were watching it. It shows you what people will do for fame, yes, but it also shows you that those people don't end up happy. Even if at the end of the movie Roxie and Velma have a successful act, you know that they are never going to have a boyfriend for long and will either end up back in jail, or live a miserable life of 'jazz, liquer and drugs'.  <br />All of that aside, it is a great musical and you can critisize it all you want, but at least have a legitimate reason!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|As a long time fan of DUNE this set comes as something of a let down, I desided to watch the new theatrical transfer first as is was on side A. And all I can say is WOW!!! A great quality transfer and the NTSC colour code is a much better than the PAl edition I'm used to. The extras on side one were interesting but generally standard stuff. And so I turned to the extended edition on side B. Dispite was many have said, I've compared all editions and can say that this is 1.85:1 widescreen cut of the movie enhanced for 2.35:1 (some of the scenes definatley look croped from the other editions but dont have the pan & scan effects that were on video editions I've seen) - however, some scene look like 4:3 croped but for the most part it looks like it is an enhanced 1.85:1 - over all, the additional footage seems to repeat itself alot and the prolouge sucks. And to make things worse the narration is dreadful compared to Virginia Madson's in the theatrical edition. All in all, this is the best edition of the extended cut but I think its safe to say there really wasnt any need for it - I can see why it was cut down and changed - and is much better for it. I think this release is worth getting just for the enhanced theatrical edition, but if you already own a copy on DVD dont go to the extra expense
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Calling it now people: Richard Armitage IS the next IT guy.  <br /> <br />When will America wake up to this masterpiece?

Brian Percival - you are amazing. The cotton swirling, you are fantastic, can i please come and work for you? I am forever a huge fan.  <br /> <br />This WILL be the next CLASSIC - its only a matter of time. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD series, you will not be dissappointed.
1400032717|4.0|Today I decided to write a review. My counselor, who is called Harvest, told me that people like to read reviews about how you feel about a certain book. So I decided to write my review about The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time. This is because it is the last book I read. Even though my memory is really good, my memory about this book is the best.     I read some other reviews before writing this. A lot of people are saying that this book is about the dog being murdered. But I don't think it's about the dog. I think they are just being stupid because the book is really about a boy and his perception of the world. His perspective is unique and I think that's why the author thought it would make a good book. (I like that the boy is a lot like me. He doesn't like being touched and neither do I.) Harvest says I shouldn't call people stupid, but I don't understand why I can't call them that when that's how they're being.     A lot of people said this book was sad or depressing. I don't think it was sad or depressing. It made me feel safe. This is because the author writes in very simple terms. This made it easy to understand.     One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is an example of something depressing. I haven't read the book, but I have seen the movie, and it made me feel like this: >>> :( <<<. It is about a mental patient and it has a very tragic ending. I liked it because the movie has Jack Nicholson in it. Jack Nicholson is a good actor. I know this because he is very old and he has been in a lot of movies. And because he gets paid a lot to appear in his movies.     My counselor told me that I should write about what I liked and did not like about the book. Here is a list of what I liked:     1. I liked that the story was unique and very different from other books I read. There was a mystery, and I like mysteries.   2. I liked that the boy in the story tried to teach us random things (about maths problems and the constellations and how people think and God). I like to learn new things.   3. I liked it when he went off on tangents because tangents make me think of maths and I like maths. (I was going to show you my favorite maths problem involving tangents and parametric equations here, but Harvest says people aren't interested in reading about maths problems.)  4. I liked that he let us see the world through the boy's eyes. But I have already talked about this so I won't talk about it anymore.   5. I liked that I was always interested to see what would happen.   6. I liked that he liked animals because I like animals too.   7. I liked that it was short and I read it very fast.   8. I liked the illustrations, maps, and diagrams.     And here is what I did not like:     1. I think most people could probably write like this author writes. But it doesn't bother me too much since the story is interesting and good.   2. Sometimes the actions of the characters seemed a little too convenient. But it didn't bother me too much because it is not a true story.   3. His writing style is like mine. It was nice, but by the end I was a little bored with it. This is because it made me feel like I was reading a book that I wrote.   4. There was one inconsistency, and it bothered me. In chapter 113 he says he does not understand people because they imagine things that aren't real. Then right away in the next chapter he talks about imagining something that isn't real. This is a lie, and I don't understand why people tell lies.     Overall, I think the book should get 4 stars.    (New readers please note: This review deliberately mimicks the style of the book in order to give you an idea of how it reads.)
B00008PW2D|4.0|i love this series, especially the coffee shop scenes. they are hilarious everytime. the first time i watched season 5, i was very disappointed. i thought it was terrible. but then i watched it again and now i LOVE it! miranda's story with the baby offers HILARIOUS instances to be funny, like when her cat eats the baby's belly button and such. her and steve are so cute together. and i love kristin davis in the season as well. her character is so good even after going through a divorce and still hoping for true love. kim cattrall, as always, is excellent, and the samanatha/richard storyline gave her a chance to be a normal woman for once, not someone who has wild and crazy casual sex all the time without falling for the guy. because, believe me, NO WOMAN can do that for very long without feeling SOMETHING. <br />i do like carrie but this season she really pissed me off. it seems that the more i watch this show, the more her character bugs me. carrie is so self-involved, especially in this season, that i can't understand why any of the girls would want to be friends with her. i know the show is centered around carrie and her 3 friends, but for ONCE, couldn't they have NOT made it \\"all about carrie?\\" especially the episode where miranda has the baptism and asks carrie to be the godmother... where has carrie EVER shown that she would make a good guardian for a child? even she says it herself that she never thought she was very maternal. and i can't stand how, after everything miranda has going on in her life (her NEWBORN CHILD, her career, sleep deprivation), how she can still empathize and listen to carrie babble on about aidan and their mistakes, when she's already overplayed them so many times before? carrie, take a hint... @ least miranda's got real problems. <br />maybe i'm wrong, and i know there are episodes where carrie's character is sensitive to her friends' needs, but they are few and far between.
1896597890|5.0|Since the end of the Korean War, North Korea has become the most isolated, mysterious and fortified country on Earth. Unlike many other remote locations around the world North Korea is not a place many people would want to spend any time. However, thanks to globalization, North Korea's vast supply of super cheap labor and a real need for foreign investment the country has opened its doors just a crack and in peeked cartoonist Guy Delisle for a view at probably the most tightly regulated society on the planet. Mr. Delisle documents his experience in North Korea accompanied by his ever present \\"guide\\" and his translator. Pyongyang isn't really a story per se as much as a slice of life glimpse at the daily goings on in North Korea or at least as much of a glimpse as foreigners are allowed to see.<br /><br />The drawing style in Pyongyang is a minimalist black and white that captures nicely the mirthless life in North Korea. You get a sense that the leadership is desperately trying to maintain a good face for the rest of the world but like the bridge in the book that only gets half painted the rust is bleeding through and the cracks are growing. There could hardly be a better advertisement for Capitalism and Democracy than the sterile, dystopia that is North Korea where airports and restaurants operate without lights and massive construction projects sit unfinished and crumbling. Freeways are built without exits and all the people listen to the same state run radio broadcast featuring music that sounds like \\"a cross between a national anthem and the theme song of a children's show\\".<br /><br />North Korea has the same kind of creepiness as a cult except on a massive scale where Kim Jung Il acts as patron deity and his smiling visage is ever present in society. Each room has his portrait and his face appears on a pin that all Korean's are required to wear. This is a land where worker can advance by ratting on their fellow citizens and slight infractions can cause people to suddenly vanish.<br /><br />Guy Delisle does a superb job of capturing the bleakness and bizarreness of North Korea contrasting it with his own light hearted rebellious attitude.

B0002OERI0|1.0|I've certainly seen some studio-planted where employees or bigwigs of a company purposely post glowing reviews so buyers are duped into creating more record sales, but I never knew retail stores did the same thing... until I started seeing a similarity with Amazon Gift Card 'reviews'. Buyer Beware: Any review that says something to the effect of \\"Buy this and get a $500 Amazon Gift Card\\" was planted by Amazon.com. Amazon does the same thing with DVD reviews too. The five stars they give is no indication of how good an album or DVD is, especially in Green Day's case, with this bomb of an album (it only has three semi-good songs that were killed by oversaturation). <br /> <br />By the way, Green Day have lost their minds and gained monster egos... well, at least Billie Joe has. The negative reviews have much more of a ring of truth than the false five-star reviews. Green Day are nothing more than a tattooed traveling TRL machine that panders to the ultimate majority. Ironic for a band that claimed they \\"wanna be a minority\\" on their previous album.
0307276902|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out.  Yes, I bought it because it was in the Oprah Book Club.  I thought it was a wonderful story then and still think it's a wonderful story.  I have actually re-read it several times.  It shouldnt matter if the author expanded upon the truth.  It is a book and story and should be treasured like any other.  Mr. Frey continue your great work!.
0307276902|5.0|If you're reading this review, you must know about the whole fact vs fiction issue. Here's the deal, I have been blessed to never have to face drug or alcohol addiction or have a close family member or friend face it. But I read this book, and it wasn't the details of the Novocaine, Lily's death, or days in jail thay riveted me: it was when he revealed his thoughts, his feelings, his emotions - and noboday can stand on their soap box and challenge him on how he felt.  <br />I can see where Oprah was coming from - she must realize the power her endorsements gives these books, but I didn't understand why James didn't stand up for himself more - or just say he was sorry and he shouldn't have done some things the way he did. Do a 'Hugh Grant' and get on with it. <br />Plus, I thought the details about his number of days in jail, the manner in which Lily died, etc were in 'My Friend Leonard' which did have the disclaimer of information being changed - not in 'AMLP'. <br />Overall, two great books from James, and I hope he can bounce back from this - I would read anything else chooses to write. It's so easy to pick on those who are down - and so many people in the entertainment industry have done worse things. This man has a strong voice, a wonderful style, and I hope his contributions won't stop because of this. I honestly feel like the publisher knew more than they are admitting...
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I hate to admit it--I wanted to be the type of person who liked this film. I love indie movies and nerds (real and ficitonal). But this movie was patently uninteresting--it had no hook. I kept waiting to be entertained, to smile (forget about laughing). Or even just to begin to care about the charachters.<br /><br />Even if you disregaurd the fact that the \\"humor\\" in this film is lame the charachters obviosuly don't enjoy their lives so there is no way to laugh with them. The only way this film could be entertaining is if you decide to let yourself laugh AT the charachters and even that is difficult given that they are more grating than amusing.<br /><br />I can appreciate bizarre movies, but they have to be entertaining. This movie does nothing for me. It's just blah--and worse than that it's an unpleasant blah. The film was entierly unengaging, patently uninteresting, and mildly offensive. I am easy to please--I like almost EVERY movie I see. But this was hands down one of two or three worst movies I've ever seen.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Usually I am not thrilled by action films, but I was somehow persuaded to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith anyway by my brother. I was soon glad that I went; this movie is certainly not deep or philosophical, but it is entertainment in its purest form. If you don't mind watching a simple, literal film with not much left to the imagination, you could do much worse than this. It's funny, clever in spurts, and far from boring. The implausible romance and the incredible invincibility of Pitt and Jolie are, naturally, a given, but the screenplay more than makes up for the trite silliness of its plot with the dialogue between this interesting (and very attractive) couple. This is a movie that you can watch with the whole family (relatively speaking) and everyone will be equally delighted. Mr. and Mrs. Smith was an enjoyable trip to the theater and a worthwhile purchase, even if it isn't something you can watch three nights in a row.
B0000025OP|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dylan albums. It is not one of his most famous ore most astounding. None of the songs is very famous. It is not a musical breakthrough. But it has something intimate to it, that some of his other albums lack. <br />This album is like a brown-haired, simple, but mysterious girl (Hazel?). No gorgeous blonde or sensual mediterranean. It is a cute auburn, that needs to be discovered. <br />And the album is like a discovery. From the fancy \\"On A Night Like This\\" (the night we meet Hazel?), to the thoughtful \\"Forever Young\\", up to the more intimate last songs, crowned by the beautiful \\"Wedding Song\\".
B000BVEKO0|5.0|KoRn's album, \\"See You On The Other Side\\" is the ultimate rock experience. You can always count on KoRn to deliver a heavy, jam out album, but \\"See You On The Other Side\\" really has a different twist then the other albums, they took a more industrial sound with this album. This album still has the heavy guitar, bass slapping, and drum pounding sounds like with songs like \\"Liar\\" but it really is a new KoRn sound. They seem to always say in reviews that they have changed but this album really does put a new twist on KoRn, but I must say it was what KoRn has needed, being in this game for so long. As far has Jonathan Davis's lyrics and voice, they are still just as bone chilling as ever. With songs like \\"Hypocrites\\" and \\"2-way\\", he has out did him self with his messages, the whole album is a must hear. I must say KoRn is one of those bands that will be around forever and they really put their hearts into every album, which is very obvious with \\"See You On The Other Side\\". If you haven't listened to KoRn in awhile, check out this album, you won't be disappointed. If you buy this album be sure to get the limited edition one, it's worth the money with the awesome packing, pictures and original artwork. Can't wait to see them on tour in 06 to support See You On The Other Side.
B00008IAMD|5.0|This album is the culmination of a GREAT career.  My only wish is that Johnny was still around to make more beautiful songs such as these.  I am a kareoke junkie, with a deep voice, and I have seen barflys moved to tears by my cover of his cover of Hurt (and I am nowhere near the virtuoso Mr. Cash was).  Personal Jesus is probably my 2nd favorite song on this disc, it just rolls along, and you don't want it to end. <br />The haunting melodies of these covers and origionals make this album an instant classic.  The lack of more \\"traditional\\" backup instruments adds a personal feel to the songs, and really makes them really hit home.  I have found myself becoming introspective while listening to this compilation, and when it is over, wanting to start over again as well.   <br />The DVD is most definately worth it.  The video is the best I've ever seen, and I wish it still had the playing time it did when it first came out.  It made me cry the first few times I saw it, and I never cry, for any reason.  It is a powerful conclusion to a powerful career.  I would reccomend this album to anyone, country fan or not.

0440241588|5.0|Think that might be Grisham on the cover? Look at it and then check out the picture of Grisham on the inside back cover. What d'ya think?<br /><br />Grisham writes the way I like to read. Paints the scene, but doesn't overdo it. Defines his characters enough to make them believable, and uses dialogue to move the plot along. The balance between white space and text in The Broker was easy on the eyes. The chapters were not too long or too short (very short is popular these days), and the back-and-forth cadence of changing scenes helped hold my interest. I didn't want it to end. I even grew fond of the once obnoxious, smarmy, and selfish Joel Backman. Enter Marco Lazzeri.<br /><br />The political intrigue in The Broker is well defined and plausible, with multiple bad actors wanting to get their hands on newly pardoned Backman because of what they think Backman knows. Backman was a Washington power broker (one who brings together lobbyists and agents of the federal government)who has been in jail for his \\"illegal conduct.\\" It seems there's a software program (JAM), written by three bright young Pakistanis, that can manipulate a recently discovered satellite system orbiting the earth. Apparently, no one knew about the satellite before the three Pakistanis discovered it quite by accident. Once discovered, no one admits to having put the thing in space. (Techno-geeks will have some trouble with the technology part of the book. However, Grisham says in a note at the back of the book that he's technologically challenged. Most lay readers will just look past JG's technological shortcomings and enjoy the story as a whole.)<br /><br />Overcome by greed, the three young men decide to sell their software to the highest bidder, which is where Backman comes into the picture. It isn't long before people start dying and Backman flees to prison for safety. Suddenly, six years into a fourteen-year sentence (not six months as stated on the back cover), outgoing U.S. president Arthur Morgan pardons Backman and the fun really begins! The question everyone is asking is, Why the pardon? Evidence then appears that indicates Backman may have paid for his pardon. Could this be so? The CIA is deeply involved in this messy business, as are the Israelis, the Saudis, the Chinese, and the Russians. Can Backman outwit them? Will he die? The CIA is counting on it, but not until someone can get the information they want out of him--the location of the software program everyone covets.<br /><br />One of the elements of this book I thoroughly enjoyed was the exposure to the language and culture of Italy: the bits and pieces of conversational Italian and the descriptions of daily life in an Italian town/village. The Broker was a pleasure to read (editorial errors, notwithstanding). It has been a while since I've read Grisham and, I must say, he sure has a love affair with the adverb \\"mightily.\\"<br /><br />Arrivederci!<br />Carolyn Rowe Hillthe fun really begins!

B00005JOFO|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie , had high expectations,I thought the movie would be a great friendship that turned into love, but the men didnt seem to have the chemistry and they didnt even seem to really like eachother,there were no real tender moments,the scenes were rough and also drawn out, Im very emotional but watching this movie i didnt shed a tear I didnt feel the love or friendship of the two men  what a disapointment I left the movie feeling empty  the scenery was breathtakingly beautiful though  i enjoyed that
B00005JOFO|5.0|I grew up in the era this movie is based on. Let me say I have not yet seen it but it sure is on the top of an own list as soon as it is available..To all of you who havn't seen it, don't knock it or you afraid it might rub off? believe me it won't...
B0001KU93C|3.0|I grew up with and loved Sergio Leone's \\"Man with No Name\\" trilogy with Clint Eastwood. I tend to love Italian pictures (horror and otherwise) and recently having watched Leone's trilogy again, I decided to quench my Spaghetti Western thirst by purchasing a number of now rather unseen \\"classics\\" that Leone's films inspired.<br /><br />Of all the Spaghetti Westerns I purchased the film Django was one of the best. Does that make it a great film? Oh hell no. Django, released in 1966 was one of the first films to be \\"inspired\\" (ah-hem...Rip-off) Leone's Fistful of Dollars. The film molds itself along the same lines as that film. A loner anti-heroic cowboy (played by Italian B-great Franco Nero) travels to a remote, dying western town and ends up fighting two rival bands, a Mexican rag-tag army and an American rag-tag army. As you can tell from the story...it was majorly influenced by the much much better Leone picture. Not only the story, but the appearance of Franco Nero himself is a direct take-off of Clint Eastwood's character. The actor that dubs the voice for the English release even does his best to do a Clint Eastwood impression...an impression that only really induces laughter.<br /><br />The film tries to be another Fistful of Dollars but it doesn't come close to Leone's grand low-budget feature. The reason why is that this film suffers from some poor acting and some majorly poor dialogue. The bad dialogue could just be the fact of bad translating but some of the lines Nero spouts off are just hilarious! The plot also has some weird aspects such as how Django drags a coffin around. I won't tell what he keeps in the coffin (as it is a nice plot device) but I just found it thigh-slapping funny how this guy drags a coffin around wherever he goes! That would get really old after walking hundreds of miles! What's so great as they take this ridiculous plot device seriously! The directing on the other hand is typical Italian greatness. Sergio Corbucci has a real eye for making the camera shots interesting. He would prove to be the master of the genre (right after Leone) with his great films The Great Silence and Companeros...both of which are FAR better than Django when it comes to quality.<br /><br />Though Django has many problems it doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I had a great time with this cheesy spaghetti western that took itself a little too seriously. If you go into this expecting another \\"Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" then your going to be sourly disappointed. But if you go into this expecting a nice little cheeseball spaghetti western that delivers on the entertainment value, then you will find it much to your liking.<br /><br />As for the DVD Blue-Underground does another fantastic job at reasserting a long forgotten film. However, it should be warned, that Blue-Underground used the original uncut negative of the film and some of the scenes were damaged because of age. This could put off some people of but for viewers like me, we are just glad to the UNCUT version available in all its bloody glory. This includes an awesomely gruesome \\"ear cutting\\" scene. Being a huge fan of Italian horror cinema with the likes of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, I get a kick out of these controversial violent gore scenes. Thanks blue-Underground!<br /><br />The limited edition that I got comes with a bonus disc that features a Franco Nero western film short on one of those little mini-DVDs. The bonus film is under 10 minutes, features no talking making it basically a way for the director to show off style. It's good for a one-time watcher as most probably won't stick it into their DVD player after viewing it the first time.<br /><br />On a side note I love how Django was so popular that it inspired 50 unofficial sequels? Over 50?! That's unheard of. I know Italy is known for making lots of unrelated \\"unofficial\\" sequels (as in the case of Dawn of the Dead) but over 50 is just incredible! Of all the \\"sequels\\" there is only one official one made in 1987 called Django Strikes Again starring Franco Nero (haven't seen it yet but soon will). Blue-Underground released one of the \\"unofficial\\" sequels strangely titled Django Kill...if you live, Shoot! which I just ordered. One of my new goals in life to view every single one of the 50+ unofficial sequels to Django. Hell, I might even name my kid Django. Oh my God Django...what have you done to me?! Now you've got me talking kids.....YIKES!!!in starring Franco Nero (haven't seen it yet but soon will).

B0002VKZL6|5.0|I was gifted this album in mid-October.  Gave it a listen once and enjoyed the general sound of it.  And I didn't listen to it again until my XM trial-subscription expired on the first of December.  For some reason, the colder the morning, the better these songs sound to me.  I popped in the CD on a bitterly cold December morning and this album just clicked.  It was a perfect match, clean crisp guitar, vocals and lyrics that warmed my soul.   <br /> <br />I am unable to articulate words and phrases that describe the music, so my review stops here, you'll have to listen to it for yourself.  But I would like to leave you with one piece of advice for listening to this music and for most others.  Be alone, whether it's in your car or at home.  And turn it up so you can feel it.   <br /> <br />Additionally, I haven't seen a review that mentions the theme running throughout this album, \\"men in businesses, their successes and corruptions.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0307276902|5.0|Frey tried to publish his book as a novel, it was the publishing company that market it as a memoir, nobody seems to care about this little detail. Yes, things went out of control and Frey was already to involved with it to back out. That is regrettable, but not the end of the work. <br />The truth is that memoir or not the book is very well written and Frey is one of the best authors that came out in the last 20 years. He will be able to deliver great books in the future, and nobody should allow Oprah to destroy that. <br /> <br />As for Oprah, she appears on TV with her hair over her face, dark shadows on her eyes, everything wonderfully staged to make her look pissed off. She offers a 30 seconds \\"apology\\" and for the next hour she rips Frey apart and successfully ruins his life! Come on people! Is this the type of trash TV we want to watch. He made mistake, it's over let's move on! This is not the first time Oprah gets in trouble with her Book Club, anybody remembers Jonathan Franken, when she put her name on the cover of his book without asking for permission?  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and every time you see Oprah on TV change the channel, overtime it will make you a better person. And if you are so offended about this book go get your money back and really move on.  <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|Joaquine once again proved to be one of the most exceptional actors ever to hit the screen along with the talented Reese who proved to her audience that she is not only a comical romance actress but a true dramatic actress. Both poored their hearts into thier acting and into their singing. Joaquine threw out a rustic sound just as Cash always did. I was blown away by Reese's singing voice...she belt out such an amazing sound, off the charts! She is an amazing entertainer.  <br /> <br />The beginning of the movie gave me shivers....the setting was so thrilling and the music was pounding while the guards marched through the penitentiary. It was so intense that I was completely revved up for the show.  <br /> <br />The entire movie was amazing although I couldn't beleive the actors they chose for Elvis and Jerry Lee....They should not have been cast....Joaquine and Reese put them to shame. Cash's first wife in the movie was played by Ginnifer Goodwin who gave such an incredible performance. She was dramatic in every aspect and played the part just as real to life as it comes.  <br /> <br />I absolutely suggest to anyone who enjoys even a good love story to see this movie....Walk the Line could spark the interest of anyone. It is full of so many aspects of life.  <br /> <br />Wonderful movie!
0307276902|5.0|I read this book last winter on my brother's recommendation, long before Oprah, the Smoking Gun and the media at-large got a hold of it.  Frankly, having watched the Larry King interview and Oprah's follow-up lashing yesterday, I actually ended up feeling sorry for James Frey.   <br /> <br />Maybe I'm just naive, but I personally don't think he set out to intentionally fleece millions of readers and \\"dupe and embarrass\\" Oprah.  I doubt he could have imagined that one day he'd be getting such widespread attention from his book. Yes, James Frey wasn't entirely truthful about what he wrote.  Yes, names and facts and events were changed.  But I watched him calmly and openly admit these things to Larry King, as well as state that he had shopped the book as a novel, non-fiction, etc. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect and regard for Oprah.   And I can see how she would feel betrayed and embarrassed.  But along with the reviewer above, I have to agree that this is far from the first time that an author has stirred controversy with his/her work.  To use James Frey as a scapegoat for all authors of \\"memoirs,\\" feels wrong and unjust to me.    <br /> <br />At the same time, this whole situation seems to serve, in a way, as yet another example of wasted energy and focus.  We live in an apparent democracy of personal freedoms, free-and-balanced press, etc.  And yet our own government and certain media outlets are far from honest with us.  Where's the furor against them?  Where is our conviction?  Why are we so obsessed with Michael Jackson trials and yet so apathetic and complacent with our own rights? <br /> <br />Give this a guy a break already.
B0000584V3|1.0|First and foremost, this is not Death Metal. No matter what anybody else may say. Those who think so clearly know nothing of the genre. This is Progressive Rock with some occasional metal riffs and Death Metal-styled growls.  End of story.      Over the years, I have heard a lot of hype about this album.  I've heard a lot of hype about Opeth in general. But what I really don't understand is... why?    After listening to this album several times, I just can't bring myself to like anything about it. Sure, its got a lot of potential. It really could have been something great. But its... well, not.  The songs themselves seem to be long for the sake of writing long songs, as if its some kind of necessity for Prog songs to be lengthy. Each song is comprised of several passages, but the passages don't really come together well at all. There's no transition; the songs just change abruptly from one thing to another. Lifeless, repetitive guitar work and bland Death growls almost randomly become acoustic interludes with bland melodic vocals.  Speaking of vocals, the death growls don't really work well with the music, either. As has been mentioned before in other reviews, Opeth seems to like taking the \\"modern\\" approach to metal. But again, as previously stated, most of this isn't even metal. Its more like Prog Rock with what sounds to me like occasional Gothenburg guitar work. You know, those noodling melodic riffs that are present in several of these songs, such as The Leper Affinity. Then throw in those horrid death growls and there you have it: Instant modern \\"Metal\\".  Sometimes the riffs are actually interesting, but throughout the songs and passages they are repeated far too often, and any chance the songs might have of becoming interesting is lost once the next passage starts (or the song ends, whichever the case may be).    Getting back to song length, it seems that Opeth might be trying to go for that epic feel that is ever-present in the Prog world. Unfortunately, asstated before, the lack of transition between passages quickly eliminates any epic feeling to this album. If you want something epic, go buy an Ayreon album.  Akerfeldt is actually one of the vocalists for the latest Ayreon album, The Human Equation. He actually does pretty well, in my opinion. So why not here? Most of the time you can't really tell what he's saying, so whatever concept he's trying to get across is lost in his incoherent singing. And when he's not doing death growls, his melodic singing is too uninteresting for one to notice what he's saying. And he doesn't really have any feeling or emotion to his voice, much like the music itself. (See: Rob Halford and Daniel Gildenlow (Pain of Salvation) for how to achieve emotion.)    All in all, this album really could have been good. But Opeth seems to lack the ability to write coherent and interesting songs. (Dream Theater, anyone?)  If you want some real Prog, listen to Ayreon (Or just about any Arjen Lucassen project, for that matter) or Pain of Salvation's \\"The Perfect Element Part I\\" and \\"Be\\" albums. Unless, of course, you've a thing for incoherent and uninteresting music.    (Originally written for [...]
B000B894AI|3.0|What the heck was Dave thinking to end this otherwise excellent story they way he ended it ? I am only giving it three stars because the first 3/4 of the story would keep you breathless and guessing....until you get the the final four chapters...     The ending is - for the lack of a better word - dumb...Words 'totaly implausible' and 'extremely far-fetched' don't even begin to cut it...It's like he ran out of his imagination and figured it was time to wrap it up with a completely insanely unrealistic finale..    I feel almost like David went to Maui for some long needed R&R while his maid sneaked in, took a peek and finished the story to her simpleton liking...    The ending stands apart from the rest of the story and makes it feel detached... But David Baldacci is the master storyteller, no doubt.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|That was Churchill's (Winston, not Ward) characterization of the service he commanded, not masterfully, as Lord of the Admiralty.  More sober analysis suggests that the Royal Navy more closely resembled Aubrey's HMS Surprise than it resembled Chruchill's distempered reminiscence.  Someone, somewhere, recently wrote that the Empire's navy was the most democratic, meritocratic, and ennobling institution of the Empire. <br /> <br />Rum and the lash do appear on the Surprise, but nobility (in the democratic sense) and merit prevail.  This film has a large and noble spirit;  it's an anomaly & an anachronism in an era (ours, 200 years after Trafalgar) that weighs movies by the pounds & tons of deviancy they deliver.  Master & Commander delivers mastery, inspiration, and something almost forgotten & unexpected:  good men acting like men.   <br /> <br />
B000002I2M|5.0|Although they suffered a tragic ending to their career with Jim Morrison being found dead in a Paris hotel, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is certainly an album that can be looked back on highly as a good close to a fabulous career for the best Bar rock band that graced the 60s. While through their career The Doors often took different directions with their sounds, bringing in a dark, eerie mood for the album \\"Strange Days\\" and experimenting with more pop friendly tunes in \\"The Soft Parade\\", the group always held a place for the blues. Therefore perhaps it was fitting to close their career with a studio album featuring tracks pioneered by a slow, grooving blues sound.<br /><br />\\"The Changeling\\" is a nice, energetic organ driven track, with a familiar Doors sound of good rock and the group quickly establishing an edgy tone for the opening song. \\"Love Her Madly\\" is a Doors classic, very radio friendly and catchy, with a nice medley arranged mostly through the organ. \\"Been Down So Long\\" is a nice, fairly heavy rocker with Morrison providing a great vocal. \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" is strictly blues, slow paced with good riffs and lyrics.<br /><br />The self titled track simply has a sensational instrumental and some of the best lyrics on the album, an obvious highlight. The core of the song is outstanding, with quick driving guitar riffs. \\"L'America\\" is a little less memorable than others on this album, but is by no means worthy of a skip. \\"Hyacinth House\\" is a softer song, with beautiful instrumentation and an easy going vocal offering from Morrison. For another great, unreleased version of this song, check the Doors Box Set, Disc 1. \\"Crawling King Snake\\" ventures back into a bluesy sound, this song having a little more substance than a track like \\"L'America\\", featuring great, clean guitar work from Robby Krieger. \\"The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\\" generates more energy, with the drums being heavier and Morrison simply reciting the lyrics. \\"Riders on the Storm\\" is probably the shining moment of this studio album, a 7 minute epic song, highlighted by a brilliant Ray Manzarek organ solo, and some of Morrison's most poetic lyrics.<br /><br />Although unexpectedly \\"LA Woman\\" turned into the last Doors studio album, it does not by any means disappoint. Featuring three hit tracks, and some of the best blues/rock and instrumentation of by the band, this album should be owned by all fans of The Doors. As a group, The Doors redefined bar rock n' roll, and this album reaffirms why they should be remembered for their great feel for the blues and rock genre. Highly recommended.the shining moment of this studio album, a 7 minute epic song, highlighted by a brilliant Ray Manzarek organ solo, and some of Morrison's most poetic lyrics.  <br /> <br />Although unexpectedly \\"LA Woman\\" turned into the last Doors studio album, it does not by any means disappoint.

630460288X|5.0|This is Huxley's (everyone alive back then remembers where they were & what they were doing on the day Aldous Huxley died) Brave New World on rat meat, and it's a dish best eaten hot.  Which brings us to Sandra Bullock ... if only she'd let us come in and play. <br /> <br />It's said in another review that she steals the show, but that's actually done by a beautiful blonde, Wesley Snipes.  He and she and even Stalone are having a real good time in this movie, and I had a marvelous time watching them get it together.  Especially enjoyed Alfredo Garcia and his up-beat reverence for teevee's greatest hits. <br /> <br />And it's true beyond reasonable doubt that everything is going to be Taco Bell.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Korn's heavy hitting new album is what all the fans have been waiting <br />for.  Packed with 19 songs, if you get the Deluxe Version, which you <br />should get as it includes two music videos of live performances of <br />Twisted Transistor and Hypocrites.  Some of my personal favorites that <br />might not make it into singles include Love Song and Souvenir, so <br />definitely buy the album as you might not hear these on the radio! <br />
0307276902|1.0|While I am utterly outraged by the fact that he fabricated what I believe is a great deal of this book--from his own persona, to details of other people, to major events--what most annoys me about this book is that Frey's writing is at best sub-par.  His sentences are unoriginal.  He repeats himself in order to press a point.  He has an unbelievably irritating tendency to capitalize nouns, making it hard to read the book, because my eyes keep getting caught on all the capital words.  Now that I know that the trip to the denist was BS, I can't really get through the book because I am overwhelmed by incredulity.  The fact of the matter is, this book would never stand as a novel; the writing itself isn't creative enough and there is little over-all artisty to support the novel form.  The only way this book has magic is through what Freud called the unheimlich, or, the 'uncanny': the feeling of mystic wonder we get when we read or experience something that seems too fantastic to be true, yet, by golly, still is.  Now that we know it's not true, there is no magic, only bad writing.
0812550706|5.0|I was assigned to read this book for school. Usually the books they give us are boring and I hate them. I started to read this book and was instantly sucked in. I couldnt stop reading this book. With the constant action my eyes were glued to it. Ender is a young boy with extraordinary powers. He is a genius in war tactics, and the only one who can save the earth from the invasion.       The book had excellent character development. You get to understand the main character Ender very well. I found myself being able to figure out what he was going to do, and how he was going to react. There are also other well developed characters as well.        If you love adventurous books, with a suprise ending I highly recommend this book. You will not regret reading it.
0307155102|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my son when he was 1 year old.  He didn't read it until he was about 18 months. Now he is 3 years old and loves this book.  It talks about getting up in the morning, washing face, hands, making the bed, changing clothes, going to eat breakfast, etc. It also talks about the Supermarket, school, at the beach, camping, etc.  It is a great book.  My son really enjoys it.  He remembers Kenny Bear and tries to be like him.  I recently bought this book as a gift for a friend. I would give this book to others as well.  I highly recommend it!
B000BIQKXM|5.0|I've been a Westlife fan since I was in Primary, when they first came out, and with their latest album, Face to Face, I've been hooked onto the songs. <br /> <br />Their comeback album, after the interesting \\"Allow Us to Be Frank\\" experiment, is, as the 5th track suggests, amazing. Even tho Brian McFadden left the band to persue a solo career, Westlife do not disappoint at all. <br /> <br />Their first track might seem boring to few who aren't accustomed to such a genre, but the vocals are very different to their debut--more mature, more controlled. <br /> <br />The tracks following are simply magical. Amazing is definitely my absolute favourite, without a shadow of a doubt. The tune is catchy, it's upbeat, it's sweet, and it's very Westlife, just the kind of music you can imagine them singing live easily. <br /> <br />Some tracks made me quite uneasy at first, especially She's Back and Change Your Mind, because Westlife hadn't successfully produced such tracks, but after a few times of listening, I realized, hey, it's just something fun to kick off your shoes and sing to. <br /> <br />So any Westlife fans out there who have not bought this album have missed out their very best album ever.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Yes, people, I know you don't like all the whiney little emo-goths. I don't care for them either. However, despite the fact that MCR seem to be poster boys for that culture, this is solid offering from a solid band. <br /> <br />It's a bit pop-punk, a bit melodic metal, and a bit screamo, yet it adds up a surprisingly enjoyable album. The songs are somewhat schizophrenic, but in a good way - they are unpredictable and always changing, never boring. Singer Gerard Way in equal parts sings, screams and snarls his ass off, and there's quite a bit of harmonizing vocals, which I always enjoy. The music is entirely competant, diverging enough to keep things interesting without straying into \\"too weird\\" territory. The guitar solos are a welcome addition to the modern rock scene where solos are sorely lacking. <br /> <br />MCR is another one of those bands on the cusp of being something amazing. They're not going to be the Saviors of rock music, but they aren't going to vanish into obscurity, either. They're a welcome addition to the next generation rock music.
0307276902|4.0|Whether fact or fiction,(both of which I enjoy), the book is a very good read. You wont go wrong with this one.
B0009YA37W|4.0|Each song hits you like a wave of Bullets, making your Blood circulation race! This album is a real classic - it really deserves a 4 1/2 stars rating.Those guitars make me think a great deal about U2 (the drums also do this a bit), but Tom Smith's voice sounds as though he's the Brummie cousin of Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, but has been taking singing lessons from Interpol's Paul Banks. Those synths also remind me of The Killers suffering cold turkey after coming off Heroin. These factors all contribute, along with Smith's songwriting, to a sound more miserable than Joy Division and Nirvana put together. Each song is either a real heartstring-tugger or is a great anthem (Bullets, Blood) with a driving beat from the powerhouse rhythm section.
0307276902|4.0|Did I enjoy the book? Yes.  <br /> <br />His memoir reads like the person who wrote it had a minor mental defect, perhaps mentally retarded or a communication or mental defect. Short spare prose, capitalizing random nouns. As in: \\"I sit down on the steel bridge of the Jetway that connects the Plane to the Gate\\". Why not capitalize the word \\"bridge\\" too? Who knows. <br /> <br />In his subsequent book, \\"My Friend Leonard\\" he uses the same style but drops the weird noun capitalization. Why? Who knows. <br /> <br />Anyway, I enjoyed the book. I got tired of his endless descriptions of vomit, but that was the style of the book and the content of his story. Bare, raw, simple, crude. Like a caveman going through rehab. I liked his idea of \\"hold on\\" - that's a good message. And yes, AA doesn't work for everyone. I agree with his statements that AA just substitutes one addiction for another. If you've ever been to an AA meeting you know what I mean - a group of people furiously smoking cigarettes, drinking pots of coffee and reminiscing about the days when they were drunks or druggies, trying to top each other with their gross out stories. You can see they almost get a high from talking about it. But many people succeed with AA, it has worked for thousands of people. But yes, it is not THE Way. In that way, AA reminds me of some forms of religion. To say that their way is the ONLY way   that will work and all others will fail (or burn in hell as the case may be) is complete BS. <br /> <br />But I digress. Back to the book. I knew the moment I read it that it was BS. I guess a lot of people didn't pick up on this, so I can see why they feel cheated. When I read it, I didn't assume it was autobiographical, I read it as fiction. If you read it that way, you will enjoy it. If you enjoy books that are easy to read, riveting, graphic and include descriptions of drug use and strange/unusual people and situations, you will like this book. If you are looking for some inspiration tomefull of wisdom, heroism and triumph over adversity, you are looking in the wrong place.
0380820846|5.0|I have read many historical romance books, but I'm sure this one will always remain one of my all time favorites.  <br /> Colin's love for Penelope is so precious and tender. <br /> Penelope had been in love with Colin for years.  Colin had always seen Penelope as just a family friend, but when he finally sees through the surface to the woman within, he falls hard. <br /> Both Colin and Penelope came to life for me as I read this book (twice now).  I have enjoyed reading the whole Bridgerton series, but this one is definitely my favorite.
0307276902|1.0|This so-called \\"controversy\\" about whether \\"Million\\" is a \\"memoir\\" or \\"work of fiction\\" is highly amusing. First off, does anyone truly believe that Churchill, Eisenhower, the Clintons or any other major political figure ever distinguished between fact and fiction in writing their \\"memoirs\\"? Wasn't it Napoleon who said, \\"What is history but a fiction agreed upon\\"?  <br /> <br />Now, the American literary scene appears to be dominated by one Oprah Winfrey, who has somehow come to be the \\"Arbiter\\" of what constitutes acceptable literature. How laughable that anyone would be influenced by a mere talking head whose \\"talents\\" for gabbing and conning her audiences have earned her billions of dollars. Her fawning audiences bow at her feet daily, tossing bouquet after bouquet, largely induced by everything from free food to new cars. I mean it's not cool to dis Oprah, is it?  <br /> <br />So she hauls Frey's butt up on the stage to confess his \\"sins\\" for all the world, does a 180 and slams the guy for \\"lying\\" and \\"duping\\" -- which probably 80% of her guests do anyway -- and he walks away, publicly humiliated, but deeply grateful that the episode will probably boost sales by another one million copies. After all, you now HAVE to read the book, don't you?, to see what all the hubbub is about.  <br /> <br />I would have loved to see Oprah interview William Shakespeare to press the Bard on whether all the sonnets were based on true-love experiences, or whether the plays were \\"based on a true story.\\" Better yet, have John, Matthew, Luke and Mark make a joint appearance and press them on the dubious details of Jesus Christ's \\"miracles.\\" Perhaps Christianity would have suffered a major blow after Oprah's coming out party, but then again it might have gained millions of more converts.  <br /> <br />Oh, the delicious ironies that lend themselves to so many more books, be they fact or fiction!
B000002J2F|4.0|I'm a big fan of the early prog stuff (70-77), but found this album to be pretty good, even though this really was the beginning of the pop era for them.  Behind the Lines, Duchess, and Man Of Our Times are excellent, don't really care for Misunderstanding, but it's not a bad song, which brings me to Heathaze, I don't know what it is, but I really like this song.  Turn it on Again is classic.  The rest of what was originally side 2 of the LP is pretty unremarkable with the exception of Dukes Travels/Dukes End.  All in all, a pretty good record, not great, but pretty good.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Random plot twists, no point,  tried to be over dramatic, not good.
0800141601|5.0|This well-acted and told story features Richard Gere as the handsome, adventuresome loner, Lancelot; Julia Ormond as strong, principled Guineviere; and Sean Connery as noble King Arthur.  Ben Cross perfectly portrays the self-righteously arrogant, destructive villain, Malagant.  The settings move between the forests of Great Britain and the exquisite golden and slate blue castle of Camelot.  The brilliantly written script contains various references to Christianity.  The plot vividly portrays the struggle between forces of violent, oppressive domination and the defense of the innocent, which entails self-sacrifice.  This story is my favorite.  I've enjoyed it each time, and gain new insights with each viewing.  If you enjoy romantic, historical adventures, you will surely savor this outstanding film
B000BW7QWW|4.0|First of all, don't watch this movie if you haven't seen Firefly. I had recently emptied my Netflix que and I needed to get a few more rentals in before I cancelled my account. I came to Amazon seeing which DVDs were best sellers. Sereneity was there which led me to Firefly. So I watched all the Firefly shows and then rented Serenity. <br /> <br />You can watch this movie without having seen Firefly and you'll probably still enjoy it, but knowing each of the characters beforehand, makes this movie a lot better. <br /> <br />It's a great movie and Firefly fans were lucky to get a movie based off of a cancelled TV show. <br /> <br />At first you may find it a little different than the TV series. For instance, in the series not a whole lot of attention was given to River, she was kept a mystery for the most part. In the movie though, they focus alot more on Rivers abilities while leaving out of the stuff I enjoyed most such as Jaynes friendship with Book, Inara and Malcom, etc. The movie suffered most in that  it's believed to be the last of Firefly/Serenity on the screen so Joss Whedon had to cram as much as he could in two hours, still some questions are left unanswered. Maybe a SciFi TV movie can answer more?
0307276902|5.0|James Frey is getting a raw deal from Oprah...I joined the band wagon late and just finished reading this book at the beginning of January, 2006.  I thought the story was an incredibly honest account of James Frey's struggle with his addictions and his untimate quest for redemption.  All of the recent hype (specific details about the central people and length of time in jail) leave me with a particularly bad taste in my mouth, since that is not the central message in the book.  I would strongly recommend this book for any individual who has an addiction or is directly involved with someone with an addiction.  I found his story insightful and inspirational and my attitude toward his memoir is not even remotely affected by Oprah's outrage and the public criticism Frey is receiving.  Kudos to Frey for having the courage to get help, clean up and then relive the process by writing this book. <br />
0307276902|5.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was nothing short of an amazing book.  Whether there are discrepancies in James Frey's convictions or not, it is still fantastic.  In this true story, James Frey tells of his six weeks in a rehabilitation center in the rural Upper Midwest.  What makes \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" truly unique is the fact that it is not only one story being told, but there are several little stories told along with the plot.  The stories that James reveal to the reader are shocking and, somewhat, entertaining; they keep you wanting more.  His use of the English language is rather interesting as well.    <br />  <br /> <br />His broken grammar and syntax seem to make \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" actually live up to its name, and they also add a feeling rigidness to the book.  James' vivid allusions to his teenage years also contribute to the landscape of the story;  they make it quite interesting.  Repetition is also a major device used by James.  Meaningful or important words or phrases in the book seem to be restated over and over again repeatedly.  The repetitions were probably included to aid the reader, and they sometimes served to show an emotion such as anger or rage.  <br /> <br /> <br />James' style of writing is unique and one-of-a-kind.  The way that he expresses feelings is very personal.  His ability to convey an idea or a tone is superb.  The overall message that James was trying to display in \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" was one of hope.  This hope is for anyone who wants to avoid conventional fixes to alcoholism or any addiction for that matter.  James' desire and hope to free himself from addiction entirely are contagious.  It was a masterpiece, and I would suggest \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey to anyone.
0307276902|1.0|I purchased and read this book because I have personal experience with the subject. I was actually angry reading it as I didn't think it rang true and I thought it would do a disservice to the struggling addicts who were trying to get and stay clean. Yet everyone raved. Now I am heartened to learn that I you can't fool an old dope fiend, but you can fool people who don't know the reality.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|I had never heard about this movie when a friend of mine suggested I should check it out. It was after a conversation we had about Christian Bale's acting in Batman Begins.  <br />The acting in this movie is outstanding. Just seeing how much weight Christian Bale was willing to loose in order to play the role of Trevor is phenomenal, and is a crucial factor in allowing the movie to be perceived as \\"real\\".  <br />The plot on the other hand, is completely novel in my opinion. <br />The movie revolves around a man called Trevor who has not been able to sleep for over a year (which is possible in some sleep disorders like Fatal Familial Insomnia), and has lost an unbelievable amount of weight. It is a series of bizzarre occurences that makes one question whether what is happening is real or whether it is just hallucinations. One is definitely keeps thinking throughout the movie, and is awarded at the end with a superb ending that wraps everything up. Definitely 5 stars!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is truly and sincerely the film that paved the way for all great comic book movies. Up until this film, no one had ever thought of putting a serious adaption of a comic book on the big screen, until WB hired Richard Donner to helm a movie based on the popular comic book hero Superman.<br /><br />It seemed like a daunting task. There were difficulties with casting the part (Clint Eastwood and James Caan, among others, turned the role). However, they finally found the right guy in an unknown. 6'4, 20 something actor named Christopher Reeve. A large group of talented actors as well as composer John Williams and other talented behind the scenes whizzes joined Donner and Reeve, and Superman was ready to fly high.<br /><br />The film begins on the planet Krypton, where its leader Jor - El (Marlon Brando) has learned that the planet is about to be done in. Wanting to leave behind an heir, he sends his son Kal - El to Earth, where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford and an actress whose name I forget). Raised as Clark Kent, he grows up to learn that he has powers far beyond a normal man, and adopts a new persona: Superman. Under his Clark Kent persona, he takes a job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, where he falls in love with beautiful journalist Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Meanwhile, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is plotting to wipe out the West Coast with twin nuclear missiles, and only Superman can stop him. Can Superman save the day? Watch and find out.<br /><br />This is truly a fantastic film. Reeve will always be Superman. The cast, direction and score are great, and this new special edition has it looking and sounding better than it ever has before.<br /><br />This film is an absolute must have for any dvd collection.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Muse has a pop sensibility combined with the earthy and dark tones of which you think are reminiscent of early Radiohead (let's not forget about Pablo Honey).  But honestly, do you realize the folly in saying that Muse does Radiohead better than Radiohead?  You fool, Radiohead is the only one who can \\"do\\" Radiohead.  Furthermore, this guy sounds nothing like Thom Yorke.  The inflection in his voice, the breathy falsetto, the quivering vibrato is nothing more than an exact replica of JEFF BUCKLEY.
0307276902|2.0|I wasn't sure how to rate this book because I haven't read it. From what I have read and heard about the book, it has helped some people.  <br /> <br />I think it is great that Oprah recommends books to read....at least she has people reading. I don't however think people should pick up a book just because Oprah says so. <br /> <br />I have not read the book only because the subject did not interest me.  <br /> <br />I do feel however there should have been a note from author or publisher that not all incidents are based on fact. <br /> <br />A reader can get something entirely different from a book than another person. Take for instance \\"The Holy Bible\\". You can read a verse and get someting entirely different than another person....why do you think there are so many religions? So many different doctrines in so many churches.  <br /> <br />I recently read the book \\"Night\\" on Oprah's book club list only because the subject has interested me since I was a small girl.If you find a book, whether it is fiction, non-fiction, whatever, that picque's your interest read it. Get what you want from the book. <br /> <br />We can't always trust what the media is telling us anyway, TV, newspapers, magazines and talk shows.  <br /> <br />Listen to what your heart and head is telling you. If this book has helped people, more power to the author. <br /> <br />I think Oprah should find someone who will get the very young interested in reading....they are our future.
B000005YZM|5.0|In my searching for something different, I ran across this disc being what appeared to be over-hyped by the loyal music critics. I was familiar with all the classic hits, but \\"Odessey And Oracle\\" slipped between the cracks for me. It didn't seem possible that a disc this fantastic had been missed the first time around. Well, Thank you fellow rock critics, because this disc was properly hyped after-all. This is one of the most enjoyable cds from beginning to end. It's hard to believe that records like Sgt. Pepper are historically referred to as the Holy Grail of concept music, and this disc is a forgotten relic. These melodies are every bit as important (possibly more) as the famous Beatles masterpiece. Now I'm looking into the direction of the box set \\"Zombie Heaven\\". I urge the un-imformed to take a chance on this one.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This is a great movie that will give you the creeps and keep you on the edge of your seat. I usually like those movies that aren't all hyped up and this was one of them.This freaked me out more than the original Exorcist and I never thought another movie would. It doesn't steal any ideas from the Exorcist and has a pretty good ending, I thought. If you like horror movies that are more true to life and not the typical slasher movie, this is for you.

B000060OFT|5.0|When watching this version of Romeo and Juliet people really need to stop comparing it to other films of Romeo and Juliet...especially the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey. One thing I will say for the 1968 version is that its Juliet was far more beautiful than Claire Danes.  <br /> <br />Ok...I give this movie 5 stars. It was VISUALLY stunning! It was very vibrant and youthful and it truly captured the essense of YOUNG, immature love. That is what Romeo and Juliet felt for each other. It was not a truly substantial love because they only knew each other for a week before they decided they were ready to DIE for each other. That was just really STUPID and no NORMAL, MATURE human being would do something like that. However, it is a tragedy and I have learned to value the story and its message of love over hatred and all that stuff. The best scene, I feel, in the movie has to be the death scene. In no other Romeo and Juliet movie will you see the raw emotion and the tragic shift from joy to utter despair on Juliet's face when she realizes that her Romeo has just swallowed a deadly poison. It is probably only a minute or less, however, that one scene makes this movie. It is in that one scene that you see the true talent shine in Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes. Their performances up until that point are mediocre, but hey, what can you expect from modern kids acting out a script that is WAYYYYYYYYY before their time. Some of the executions of the lines were a little...dry and some were just plain HORRIBLE! The first words exchanged between Romeo and Juliet completely LACK any true emotion...it seems like their just...RECITING LINES! That should have been REDONE until it was perfect because it is SUCH an important part of the film. But, whatever. It's not like I was directing it...thanks MR. Luhrmann. <br /> <br />All in all...this movie is good. Probably my favorite Romeo and Juliet film because it introduced me to the tale and offered a very beautiful picture of it. Idon't think that the past films achieved such beauty simply because the resources were not offered to them...so it was lucky to have been made recently because it drew upon good lighting, cars and guns, nice beaches, crazy black guys, tattooed stoners and leather-wearing bullies, and a killer soundtrack. I don't know if EVERYONE should own this. However, EVERYONE should watch it because it is a landmark in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" adaptations.
0743454537|2.0|I agree with the other readers. The book is GREAT until the last few chapters as we watch Anna struggle to find her purpose in the world. Her purpose other than just saving her sister Kate. But then....the author gives us an unsatisfying ending that's a total disappointment. It's a copout and outrageous. And the end totally erases every step every single character took on their journey to the end of the book. Boo! <br /> <br /> <br />

Regardless whether you have a hot item or not, if Oprah has anything to do with it, it's going to be successful.  She may have intended to expose Frey's deception, but it actually motivated his sales.  It was all a ploy.
0307276902|3.0|Am I the only one that sort of feels sorry for Frey? I only got a 1/3 of the way through the book until I put it down for good. I didn't like it that much, however, I can see how other people could. I can understand the writer's impulse and compulsive need to get published. If you write books you want to get that stuff put out there and there will be plently of people (hello Doubleday) that will tempt you to compromise your integrity.  I know that he lied, he has admitted as much, but I can sort of understand the desire to get the book published.  I noticed back in September that he was extremely uncomfortable on Oprah when she was questioning him about his addiction and I remember his parents there- the absolute worst part of this whole ordeal is that he got his parents involved in this.  I think that we can all learn something from his situation.

B000C65Z1G|1.0|We were on holidays in Melbourne, and it was 43 degrees Celsius (109 Fahrenheit), so an air-conditioned cinema seemed like a safe escape.  Ha.  No, the cinema proved to be a dark box filled with disappointment.  For much of this film I felt as if a large thumb was pressed against the side of my head and I was being asked to attest to enjoying wanton displays of stupidity - a stupid plot, stupid characters, and idiotic editing and cinematography - the latter, specifically the unmotivated and constant use of jittering hand-held effects, induced a physical headache and nausea - this subsided after walking out - a prochlorperazine tablet might also have been of use.<br /><br />I fear this was meant to be a plot-driven thriller.  Sadly, the audience is virtually told the 'secret' within the first quarter hour. So, at this point, presumably the film becomes a character-led drama; however, none of the characters are believable - few of their actions make any sense.  Central to this is Rachel Weisz's and Ralph Fiennes' \\"marriage\\" - she tells him nothing about her \\"work\\" - the overtly stated reason for reticence is her desire to protect him, yet even cursory thought would suggest that no outsider would suspect him of being excluded from her knowledge and consequently her protection is utterly ineffectual.  At no level is the audience privy to any emotional intimacy between them - at best she sees him as \\"safe\\", much in the way she might see a cuddly toy, or a grandfather in a cardigan pottering in his garden.  The relationship has not been thought through by the author - I can imagine some viewers finding superficially attractive elements in both characters and feeling that these were enough to establish empathy, but then the same might well be said of the cast of \\"Friends\\", or the models in a Garnier \\"Fructis\\" advertisement.<br /><br />The plot, as stated in most reviews, involves corruption between government officials and a pharmaceutical corporation - Rachel Weisz's character, Tess Quayle, has incriminating evidence - this evidence, for no apparent reason, is not disseminated.  It becomes embodied in an actual letter - why?  She has the internet, she has contacts.  Was that Canon all-in-one fax, scanner, copier defective? The stupidity of this is so frustrating that one might be tempted to quietly weep.<br /><br />On a more serious note, the director feels obliged to tell his audience what to think.  The premiss that the poor of Africa, and elsewhere, are exploited by Western corportions and governments is not contestable - it is hardly hidden, but look at Amnesty's website, et al, for further disclosures - yet the actual scenario depicted is not as clear-cut as the director suggests.  Without elaborating too much, if a drug could avert an epidemic, what is an acceptable cost in terms of side-effects?  What is an acceptable trade-off in terms of development time, especially since it is by no means certain that a 'safer' variant could be developed.  To answer these questions details are crucial, and even then debate would necessarily ensue.  The director does not seem interested in debate, but rather would like a world of the blessed and the damned, the goodies and the baddies, and paints his cast, and the issues, accordingly.<br /><br />The cinematography at least provides some vistas of Africa and these are in the main disturbing.  Yet the editor feels compelled to have no shot last longer than two seconds.  This staccato of images is as cliched as the ubiquitous pop video clip - at times I expected a flashed shot of a lead guitarist, sweat flung from stringy hair, cut to a bald drummer earnestly bashing his Zildjian, and then back to Africa and Ralph's slightly gummy bewilderment.  Overexposed colours for the shanty-towns, a palette of greys and blues for the dreary mother country - it's not only obvious, but preechy and condescending.<br /><br />This is a badly crafted film.  A coherent dissection of the ills of Africa and the morality, or lack thereof, of Western policies towards the developing world, it is not.  Nor is it an engrossing love story - it feels as empty as Ralph Fiennes toothless smile.  For those expecting the raw shock of Meirelles \\"City of God\\", look elsewhere.
B000002HH9|2.0|The Cure are tied along with five other bands as my favorite band of all time, but not at all for their recent efforts.  I have loved all that Smith and co. have done in the past, and until this, I thought they could do no wrong.  Wish was a climactic amalgamation of all that I consider wonderful about the Cure's music, and then to drop an atrocious bomb like this was unbelievable to me.  This album borders horrible.  Everything is dull and uninspired, especially the songs which are supposed to feel melancholy, there's nothing.  Furthermore, songs like the 13th and Mint Car are laughable at best.  I think the 13th is not only the Cure's worst song, but one of the worst songs I have ever heard by any band.  This album has absolutely no flow, most of the songs seem out of place and lost, like none of them really belong with the others.  Everything is just wrong about this album.  For me, the Cure died after Wish, but at least they left us with a good amount of emotional, heartfelt and meaningful music before they left.
B000B8QF00|4.0|Alanis Morissette is an intelligent writer from Canada. She  sings passionately on her albums about interpersonal relationships, emotions and issues. I think she is really good, and I love her songs Thank U (1998) , Everything (2004) and Simple Together (a song I did not previously know) . Like most listeners to radio and pop/rock TV in the 90's , I was aware of Alanis through her 1995 debut CD Jagged Little Pill  and its five hit singles, but I actually prefer her later stuff, and I am very happy with this collection , because it has clearly been done with Alanis's blessing and contains a message from  her in the CD booklet. It also has an assortment of songs she has done that are not from her albums but from various film soundtracks and other projects, an idea I particularly like . The only song I'd have liked to have had included here that didn't make it is Precious Illusions (2002), but I was still very pleased with this 18-track CD.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
0307276902|1.0|Yes, it is a riveting book and yes, James Frey is a wonderful writer. Unfortunately, he \\"embellished\\" many key points of his so-called \\"memoir\\". Most notably, he claimed to have spent months in jail. In truth, as revealed by smokingun.com, he only spent a few hours in jail! And no, he never underwent dental surgery without painkillers. Which begs the question \\"How much of his memoir are based on actual memories?\\". Finally, as much as I want to read the sequel to his first novel, I won't buy it until it is re-classified as Fiction or states \\"loosely based on a true story\\".
0425152251|4.0|Fourteen-year-old Sophie Amundson lives in Norway.  Once she enrolls herself in an online philosophy course, she receives strange letters asking intense questions such as \\"Who are you?\\" and \\"Where does the world come from?\\"  As soon as Sophie reads these letters she begins to ponder whether or not her name or physical appearance matter and figures out that she alone cannot figure out where the world originally came from.  She begins to think, knowing that the world is part of the universe, and that the universe had to start somewhere.  That somewhere was most probably one thing, but where did that one thing come from? Sophie then contemplates the idea that God himself might have created the universe.  Even he himself must have come from something originally, but what from? <br /> Only a few days later, Sophie finds a postcard from Lebanon in her mail box.  It is addressed to a girl named Hilde Moller Knag.  Apparently the letter was supposed to be sent to this mysterious Hilde figure through Sophie.  Sophie is beyond confused  by this letter and desperately tries to find who Hilde Moller Knag is by searching through the phone book.  After her frantic search, she is sad to know that there is no one by the name of Hilde Moller Knag listed.  Sophie revisits the letter and discovers the name of the sender.  Albert seems to be another figure who could unlock the secret to the mystery.  The only problem is that she is unable to contact him. This postcard is just the first of a very complex flow of philosophical letters that will teach Sophie how to think for herself. <br /> Sophie keeps her mysterious letters a secret.  She secludes herself from her ordinary life and devotes herself to reading her letters.  When she checks the mailbox next, there is a three page letter about philosophy, saying it is the most important thing in our lives.  After reading the baffling letter, Sophie yet again checks her mail box and Discovers a new card expressing all you need for philosophyis the want to learn.  The letter also states that babies all have this wonder, but as life goes on and the human mind ages, the curiosity starts to die, Sophie becomes so intrigued with the letters that she tries to hold a conversation about philosophy with her mother who winds up questioning her if she is on drugs.   <br /> When her philosophy course integrates western philosophy, Sophie explores the world of myths.  She comes to the conclusion that myths are made up stories that made up by people when they cannot fully explain what actually happened.  The myths mostly help explain phenomena with creatures that more than likely did not ever exist.  This is why most myths are based off of higher beings that re said to really exist somewhere, but no one is able to present physical proof. If these mythical creatures do not exist, isn't it possible that God is just another myth?  <br /> Sophie's privacy is invaded when her mother finds one of the philosophy letters and believes it to be a love letter.  In order to keep her mother from going haywire, Sophie allows her mother to play and fantasize that thought.  Sophie receives a letter stating that she will be studying Greece.   <br /> As she is still new to philosophy, the words of the Greek philosophers are \\"just Greek to her\\" Although she is starting to actively question the orgin of the universe and why we are all here, Sophie is still lost about who Hilde Moller Knag is.  As Sophie becomes more obsessed over philosophy, she detaches herself from her \\"reality.\\" She pulls away from Joanna, her best friend, who does not understand why Sophie has become so distant.  Sophie is disappointed that she cannot converse with her kind hearted father, who is busy working abroad.   <br /> Half way through the book, the point of view makes a huge shift.  Suddenly we are not seeing the story through Sophie's eyes, but from the perspective of the mysterious Hilde Moller Knag herself.  It turns out that Sophie is more of a mysterious character than Hilde.  Infact, Sophie and her philosophy teacher, Robert, are just created charactors from the book that her father, Albert Knag presents to Hilde for her fifteenth birthday.  The book is so rich in detail that Hilde begins to suspect that Sophie and her teacher may actually exist beyond the pages of the book.   <br /> Albert Knag insists that he only made the characters for his daughters personal entertainment, but what if the characters in the book have taken on a life of their own? What if he was such a talented author that his subjects really come to life and really thought for themselves?  <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Broadway plays, but this movie adaptation of Rent is amazing.  I've never seen the play, but the amazing soundtrack is what attracted me to this movie and what made me want to go see it as soon as I found out it was coming out.  I bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie and was hooked.  This movie does not disappoint in the least.  Great film, though extremely depressing at times.
B000000WJK|4.0|'Star Sail' is great: starting off with dreamy chorals and near-whispered opening lines... then in with the cascading power guitars... thundering bass clipping like the audio on a Saturn V rocket launch... the murmered lyrics melting into the guitar feedback until the whole song is about to collapse, then... a magnificent resolve.  It's amazing.  'Slide Away' and 'The Sun, The Sea' are very strong. <br /> <br />Some reviewers object to the 'wall of sound' and atmospherics of this album, while others seem to object to the fact that it's not 'like' Urban Hymns.  I think this album has the same place in The Verve's and Richard Ashcroft's solo catalogs that Unforgettable Fire does in U2's: yeah, there's a lot of effects going on, in in many songs the lead singer's voice is held behind the instruments, but at its best still contains some gorgeous songs and moments.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been so psyched since buying the movie Serenity.  Missed seeing the movie while it was playing so on a whim bought it at Walmart (sorry, Amazon.com).  I was hooked and ordered the series Firefly from Amazon.  Yes, the free market is alive and well.  Anyway, that being said, the theme song keeps running through my head and I have even been dreaming about the characters since watching all 14 episodes and the movie again in 2 days.  Even rewatched some of the episodes with the comments just to get a new perspective   Came to this site today to see if there were any other fans.  See lots of normal type folk who are as nuts as I am about this series. It's nice to know that I am not alone in the \\"Gorram 'verse.\\" <br /> <br />The thing that got me was the nuance of the dialogue then the music. The character development makes me want to hang with each one of them. I am sad that we did not get to learn about the Shephard Book character.  I wanna know about his early life. I have never been a fan of Buffy and have not bought any TV shows on DVD. So all I am trying to say is that I am very glad that I don't have to up the meds!  It is like an itch that should be scratched when one finds a gem like this series.  I will definitly be more attentive to Joss Wheadon's work.  It is a tragedy that this series did not make it but such a blessing that we have the technology to experience it without the commercials!!!!
B000CBO04E|3.0|At first listen you'll be fooled. The CD has a fuller sound with better detail than the previous editions of the album that is, however, at the expense of the dynamic range. The best analogy I can use is it's like taking a piece of chocolate cake and squeezing it into a matchbox --while it may taste the same the look, texture and everything else is a mess and you lose so much. The volume has been pumped up using digital compression causing distortion (most notably on Gary Green's guitar solos). It probably sounds better simply because the volume has been pumped up but it suffers from something called \\"brickwalling\\", i.e., where the quietest sound and the loudestare almost equal in volume. That's a bad thing. The exact same master (probably the original CD itself)was used to master this as it does have the same error regarding the change over from one track to the next that was a hallmark of the original Columbia CD.<br /><br />\\"Three Friends\\" was the third album that Gentle Giant produced. Although it is a concept album (it's not a rock \\"opera\\" per se)the individual songs are all strong enough and not dependent upon each other so that you can enjoy them separately. Still, the desired effect that the band wanted to achieve is best when listened to from beginning to end. Be aware that if you order this it is currently on backorder for online and retail locations.<br /><br />This album was quickly followed by \\"Octopus\\" in 1973 which poised the band to break through to a larger audience. Interestingly, \\"Three Friends\\" was their debut in the U.S. as both \\"Gentle Giant\\" and the superb follow up \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" were not released in the United States initially. In 1974 before the band went into the studio again Phil Shulman left the band due to differences with his brothers and a desire to teach. \\"Three Friends\\" found the band finding their unique voice.<br /><br />Unlike the U.S. release this uses the original album artwork (the U.S. release strangely enough used the artwork for the first Gentle Giant album although both the CD and original vinyl reproduced the lyrics and most of the illustrations). The Japanese release duplicates the original release in a replica of the original vinyl packaging including lyrics. While the U.S. CD sounds fine, it suffers from a flat sound without much depth.<br /><br />4 stars for the album 2 stars for the \\"remaster\\".<br /><br />A couple of later reviews of the album criticizes the album graphics as looking like they were photo copies and are difficult to read.

B00009XITP|5.0|When I travelled to southern california last year to attend my niece's college graduation, my brother brought some DVD's with him and he showed me this one in particular. (It was his daughter who was graduating.) After watching it I understood why he showed me this one (out of all the dvd's he had) and why he liked it. It's a story of a girl who goes to find the father she never got to know and the father who wasn't even aware he had a daughter. Its about their new relationship and about what is most important in a person's life, relationships... not your career, your status, money, or power, etc.  In this case the relationship between a father and his daughter. It's not a chick-flick (by my definition thats a movie about a romantic love relationsip). This is a great family film for parents and children to see and for all to appreciate each other. As one young lady reviewer stated 'it made me appreciate my dad'. Hopefully it will also be a thoughtful reminder to fathers about their relationship with their kids.  When I got home, I went out and bought a copy.

0307276902|1.0|I'm both alarmed and appalled by the readers who dismiss the scandal surrounding Frey's \\"memoir\\" with such shoot-from-the-hip flippancy. We live in an age when the TRUTH is as maleable as clay - never did find those weapons of mass destruction, did we?, \\"I did not have sex with that woman\\", \\"I am not a crook\\".  Perhaps the author's message of redemption is intact; perhaps it's a bit \\"frey'd\\" at the seams. At the end of the day the TRUTH (and nothing but!) must be the standard by which we judge all the arts. What does it say about us as a people, when TRUTH is tossed aside for profit and no one objects? This \\"memoir\\" should have been published under FICTION, just as was Arthur Golden's brilliant, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". The author, his publisher, and his defenders need to take stock of what place the truth holds in our personal and public lives. The TRUTH can not be tampered with and remain TRUE - a LIE diminishes everyone and everything associated with it. I'm sorry to say that Mr. Frey's \\"memoir\\" is a dark spot on the contemporary American literary landscape.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|Simply one of the greatest albums of all time.
B00005JOIF|2.0|Steven Spielberg's latest film, \\"Munich\\", is among the most frustrating films I've ever seen:  The frustration comes from its Schizophrenic nature - going back and forth from high competence to utter brilliance during the first two thirds, then to a rapid deterioration during the last part, ending with three quarters of an hour of the most unwatchable, torturous, movie experience in memory.    During the break (and yes, we have breaks in movies in Israel - a cynical method of selling some more Popcorn), I turned to the friend I watched this film with and told him how much I enjoyed it.  During the last quarter of an hour, we quietly debated whether we really have to sit through the experience.    'Munich' is the tale of Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), the leader of a top secret, quasi official Israeli assassination squad, sent to execute the men behind the Munich Olympic Game massacre of Israeli athletes.  The film follows Avner and his team's attempts to 'target kill' the eleven men behind the plot.     The problem as I see it, is that Spielberg creates an action film with a deep underlying reflection:  Two themes run beneath the surface: one is that violence breeds violence;  The circle of violence is not solved by killing the murderers, who will be swiftly replaced by other, equally if not more vicious killers.  The second theme is that he who commits violence is effected by it.  In Nietzsche's memorable phrase: \\"if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you\\".     Unlike some critics, I do not think the movie ever really equates the Terrorists and Israeli assassins.  But it does ponder about the price Civilization pays, as Golda Meir says it \\"negotiates with its values\\".    Whether you agree with the messages or not, the film, initially at least, does not hit you over the head with them.  From the opening scene in which American athletes unwittingly aid the Palestinian terrorists to enter the Olympic compound, the film proceeds at full speed aheadas Israel calculates it response.  In one of the most effective scenes in recent films, Golda Meir (perfectly portrayed by Lynn Cohen;  if ever a performance deserved an academy award, this is surely it) debates and decides on launching an assassination attack on the terrorists.    What follows are two hours of a thinking person's action flick.  Avner Kauffman and his squad make the acquaintance of a family of information brokers, who tips them on the whereabouts of the 11 terrorists.  The relations with the family, represented by the mysterious Papa (Michael Lonsdale) and the cool Louis (Mathieu Amalric) gets tangled when Avner and his team pass on the information to the Mossad, and participate in an Israeli raid on the terrorists' headquarters in Bayreuth (which is based upon a real raid which was led by Israel's later Prime Minister, Ehud Barak).  Papa promises to keep doing business with Avner and his group, but it seems that the Family double crosses them, harboring them in a safe house with other Palestinian terrorists and possibly selling the information on their whereabouts to their enemies.    Things seem to head to a climax when the team goes after their prime target, Munich mastermind Ali Hassan Salameh,  Salameh is saved from assassination by a group of belligerent Americans in London, apparently CIA agents (Interestingly the implication that the CIA was involved with the Black September terrorists seemed to have gone without comment among the film's reviewers.  Surely that said something about the American trust in their own government).  Then the group is targeted by a beautiful and mysterious Dutch operative (Marie-Jose Croze)...     In Nick Cave's words, \\"Where do we go from here... but Nowhere?\\"  Throughout the film, Spielberg weaves in the aforementioned themes, in a way that is disturbing but not overwhelming:  The Group come within an eye blink of killing pre-adolescent Amina Hamshari instead of her terrorist father.  A Porter in a Cyprus hotel,who becomes unwittingly an aid in an assassination, throws away the blood money he receives.  But the weaving is subtle;  The message is in the details.    In the film's end, all subtlety is gone.  Instead, Spielberg seemingly turns to the audience and starts preaching:  \\"This is important!  I have a message!  Here Comes The Message!!! Make sure you don't miss THE MESSAGE!!!\\".    So we have forty five minutes or so of unwatchable film, as the action comes to a stop and Avner meditates upon the great calamity of violence.  Its slow, emotionally manipulative (alas ineffectively so), condescending, and utterly dull.  Spielberg is on the soapbox and he won't let go.    As I've said, there is much to like about this film.  The action scenes are gripping, and the acting is simply superb (It is a rare film indeed where an actor as good as Eric Bana - who was virtually the only redeeming virtue in the otherwise unwatchable TROY - is overshadowed by the other case members, particularly Lynn Cohen as Prime Minister Meir, Lonsdale and Amalric as Papa and Louis, and Geoffrey Rush as Avner's operator, Ephraim). Throughout much of the film, Spielberg does his usual magic.    But all is overshadowed by the dreadfully dull Coda.  It is so bad it really erases all the good will the film's previous 2 hours has generated.  And so as much as I loved parts of it, I cannot recommend Munich to anyone.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Slipknot have always been good for surprises and innovations. Of their current album \\"Vol 3:(The subliminal Verses)\\" meny were both surprised and overwhelmed.

Now, after the ingenious and pioneering Live DVD, \\"Disasterpieces\\", Slipknot releast their first live album documenting again the great best of programme of their three released albums so far. The first disc starts greatly with \\"The Blister Exists\\", followed by (\\"Sic\\"). Colin Richardson (Bullet For My Valentine, Cradle Of Filth, e.g.) was responsible for the mix and guarentees a perfect sound. Following are killers, such as \\"Before I Forget\\", \\"Left Behind\\", \\"Liberate\\" and \\"Purity\\". Both discs feature twelve strong tracks each of which espcially on the second disc hymns, like \\"People=S#!t\\" and \\"Duality\\" can really convince.  <br />This Live album is simply a perfect, powerful live-document in best Slipknot quality. All thumbs up!
B000BTDMDC|5.0|'nuff said <br /> <br />Ok a little more - brilliant tunes, witty lyrics, used the internet to build up a massive fan base before they ever released their first full release single. Believe the hype and see em live if you can. <br /> <br />To me this album is almost a little too polished compared to the demos released summer last year but, come it's still the best album you will buy this side of easter!
B00005JOFO|5.0|I had a chance to catch Brokeback Mountain.  I find one word to describe the movie----INCREDIBLE!  Highly recommended to those with an open mind, and can somehow relate to two men being in love.  The movie is tragic, yet rewarding.  One can relate to the \\"living a lie\\" scenario as it is so common today.  Even those who opose the gay life style need to give credit to an outstanding director, excellent cast, and most of all the beautiful scenery, which is a pleasant change from the congested, and urban setting.  I am eager to own this movie.  I would encourage people to see it, as it is a reminder to appreciate what, and who you have, because you never know when it, or who you have may be taken away from you.  I would have much rather have seen a happy ending, but life isn't always about happy endings.  It's just life, and this movie will tear at your heart.  I for one would like to see more movies like  this one.
0446577383|1.0|I have enjoyed all of Baldacci's previous books, but I simply could not get through this one. It is marred by the rapid introduction of many similar characters and frequent pauses to blame Americans for vitually everything that is a problem on this planet. All of the American characters are, at best, vacuous and self-absorbed, or are members of U.S. intelligence agencies who routinely commit assassination and other mayhem to further American interests. All of the Muslim characters are pure and devout but forced into extremism by American misdeeds. A sophomoric and annoying book.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This compilation is really great. Contains great songs, Civil War, November Rain, & Paradise City. Probably the greatest heavy <br />metal compilation of all time.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What is love and why do we humans fall in love against all odds sometimes?  What makes the sparks fly with one person and not another?  What makes one encounter a one night stand and another the love of a lifetime? Two people meet and destiny steps in to shape the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I think this movie is destined to be a classic.  It's both tragedy and romance in the style of the old masters; a modern day Romeo and Juliet, perhaps. It has so many subtle interactions and small, textural details woven in that more than one viewing is needed just to appreciate them all.<br /><br />This is a love story and once the \\"tent scene\\" is over with, you find you are also over any preconcieved ideas about it being a love story between two men.  From that point on, you see two people who are destined for heartbreak.  They try to do what they believe is right and honorable and each goes on to marry and have a family.  For 4 years they try to put their one summer of love behind them (no puns intended) but when they finally meet again, their barriers are shattered and they face the true meaning of their relationship.<br /><br />They give most of themselves to their traditional lifestyles and the expectations of society but their love for each other is enduring and can't be denied.  So they shave off just a small portion of their time over the years to go away, give in to their love, and to be true to themselves.<br /><br />As they age, the strain of this arrangemment begins to wear and they both struggle to come to terms with the paradox.<br /><br />I saw this movie over a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.  The acting is incredible and the entire cast and crew have turned out a work of art with what could easily have gone astray as the manifestation of the old joke about cowboys and sheep camps.<br /><br />The dynamics of the main characters are so real that I found myself associating their lifestyles and personalities to people I've known -- the way they deal with the issues, the hows and whys of how the relationship grows, even the rough and macho lifestyle Ennis leads -- made me think about how totally plausible this \\"love story\\" is.<br /><br />The high country scenery is breathtaking and it, too, is real.  You feel the cold up on the mountain, and experience the rough, hard work of life as a cowboy (or a cowboy's wife!) and your heart breaks as you watch these lives strain and perservere over the years as they just try to live their lives and make the best if it with what they've been dealt.<br /><br />This movie breaks all the molds and every stereotype.  These guys aren't \\"gay\\" in the way we've been conditioned to think of gay men.  The queen is nowhere to be found and these guys have all the foibles and mannerisms we've come to associate with the terminally macho.  They're human beings, with human emotions and actions and both virtues and vices in their everyday lives.  They are good men and they are real men, both are portayed as loving husbands and fathers.  Their relationship is very masculine and their affection is portrayed in a very masculine way.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my mother and my grown daughter.  All three generations came out of the theatre with a thumbs up opinion.own -- the way they deal with the issues, the hows and whys of how the relationship grows, even the rough and macho lifestyle Ennis leads -- made me think about how totally plausible this \\"love story\\" is.   <br /> <br />The high country scenery is breathtaking and it, too, is real.

B00008BXJG|5.0|Yeah!!! AC/DC rocks as the BEST metal band to ever hit the studio! I am in the process now of collecting ALL of their albums, music DVD's and clothes. I am telling you, I am a true supporter of one of the GREATEST rock-metal bands EVER! If you are just now introducing yourself to DC, then you should check out this album \\"Highway to Hell\\" and \\"Back in Black\\" Go on and treat yourself to some real music!
B00008BXJG|1.0|did the singer get drunk yet? Anyways AC/DC are one of the worst bands ever. the singer don't know his name just screams. The lyrics are dumb, the music is simple, noisy, and boring they're <br />just another overrated rock band that needed to quit right after <br />the release of the first album. <br /> <br />buy these albums insted. <br /> <br />green day american idiot <br />dire straits love over gold <br />guns n' roses greatest hits <br /> <br />don't waste your money cause the only good song is highway to hell.
B000C65Z1G|3.0|I'm perplexed why so many professional film critics raved about this film. Other than the main performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (sp?), the beautiful music, and the extras (including deleted scenes and the cool, complete 8 minute play that the film only shows snippets of)...I found this film somewhat boring, unengaging, with a choppy flow. For example, the scene when Ralph takes the train, the images on screen are hard to watch as it flashes with quick images of buildings, sky, monuments. Quite jarring and difficult for me to enjoy. It seemed to me that the director was trying to be a bit too artsy by using supposedly hip-looking shots. <br /> <br />The story is somewhat hard to follow. I couldn't keep track of all the names and who was who most of the time. John LeCarre might be a suspense master, but I'm currently reading John Grisham's \\"The King of Torts\\" that covers similar ground: a literary hero taking on \\"the evil pharmaceutical company.\\" Grisham does it better and I hope someone in Hollywood greenlights that novel for a motion picture. As for \\"The Constant Gardner\\", I had to constantly shake myself awake as I watched this film. Maybe next time, I'll be weary about seeing a film based on near universal critical acclaim. Sometimes, film critics are just drinking the same Kool-Aid...so don't believe their hype on this film. For suspense, you can find better films elsewhere more deserving of your time. Only fans of Ralph Fiennes, of writer John LeCarre, and of the director would be interested in this one.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I think this album is great. My favorite song on it is Tunnel of Love. A song that rocks and you can play over and over again. It is really a lovely song, over 8 minutes long. The live version rocks too. My other favorites are these songs, Expresso Love, Skate Away, & Solid Rock. It is a really much better record <br />than Brothers In Arms. Go get a copy today along with my 2 other <br />favorites, Love Over Gold, & On Every Street.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Scorsese produces a brilliant documentary of Dylan's early life.  He interweaves numerous sources, many of them previously unseen by the general public, including interviews he did with numerous friends and acquaintances from those days, some early family shots, Dylan's own words as recorded by Jeff Rosen at some time in the more recent past, and, most intriguing to fans, stunning color footage of the famous 1966 World Tour.  Out of this material emerges the tale of Dylan's rise to fame, the sources of his music, the themes of disguise and homelessness that have run through his art ever since. <br /> <br />Scorsese's documentary on the artist as a young man is a work of art in itself.  Despite its length, it leaves the viewer asking for more.  Like many fans, I'm desperate to see the complete song sets of the legendary 1966 Tour.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This movie is an interesting and provocative reflection about death and the role of death in our life. The actors go well and the script is well written. You can't predict what's going to happen in the next moment. This movie uses a non traditional form of story telling (I would say similar to David Lynch's style) trying to reach the unconcious.  <br /> <br />The reason I like this movie is because it has a point (I won't say what it is). And after my initial sadness of thinking of my own mortality, the movie actually made me feel better about myself and death. This is not just some weird movie that appeals to the wanna-bes of this world. <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|With this album, Avenged Sevenfold has raised the bar for musical genius beyond tangibility!  Every song in this album is simply amazing! What else is there to say other than GO GET THIS ALBUM
B000301YY8|3.0|If you're not into hearing f word in Your Beautiful don't get it. I was shocked when I heard it, I know when I bought that had explict lyrics but I didn't know the extent. Oh just a couple of minor cursing that wasn't the case. I like James Blunt, he's good singer but he does not need to add such horrible words in his music. <br />
B000BM6IQW|5.0|My opinion:  <br />I think the \\"Toxic\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\", \\"Breathe on Me\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\" remixes are the only real remixed songs, as all the others are (vocally) kinda the same. Don't get me wrong, I do like the other songs; but Toxic is just my favorite.  <br /> <br />Rate the Album:  <br />01. Toxic [Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix] - [10/10]  <br />02. Me Against the Music [Justice Remix] - [8.5/10]  <br />03. Touch of My Hand [Bill Hamel Remix] - [9.0/10]  <br />04. Breathe on Me [Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke] - [8.5/10]  <br />05.

Someday (I Will Understand) [Gota Remix Ft Mcu] - [8/10] <br /> <br /> <br />I like all the songs a lot, except for the remix of \\"...Baby One More Time\\". The beginning sucks, but I like the rest of the song better (when she starts to sing). Toxic is my favorite up-beat song by Britney, and the remix is wonderful too. It's just the best! This is currently my top 5 songs of the album, but it changes all the time, except for my #1 & #2:  <br /> <br />01. Toxic [Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix]  <br />02. Touch of My Hand [Bill Hamel Remix]  <br />03. And Then We Kiss [Junkie Xl Remix]   <br />04. I'm a Slave 4 U [Dave Aud Slave Driver Mix] <br />05. Someday (I Will Understand) [Hi-Bias Signature Radio Remix] <br /> <br />My album average is 8.2/10, very good for just a remix album! So it's surely worth buying!The extra remixes are good, I kinde wished they were on the original album and that she'd remixed hits like \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", \\"Do Somethin'\\" and \\"My Prerogative\\".
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I first started to listen to Nightwish about four years ago.  A friend who had heard them on the Winamp radio station GothAM turned me on to them.  My journey started with Century Child (AWESOME!!!!), and then Oceanborn (also great, pre-Marco album), and then Once.  After I bought it, it was nearly all I could listen to for MONTHS.  That in itself is unusual, but add to it the fact that the album had the power to drive me to tears, make me break out in goosebumps, and inspire me to write a huge amount of poetry and well...  The album starts with the masterful strings of Emppu's artistry on \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\".  The lyrics within this piece, expressed beautifully by Tarja's classical soprano lend it an inexplicable power.  The orchestration, arranged by musical genius and composer Tuomas (band's keyboardist) make this piece truly amazing.  \\"The angel learned to fly and took a step outside...\\"  The percussion on this song, when I first heard it, made me step back and rewind the cd.  Was that timpani (I know, I spelled it wrong)?  Yes, it was.  Wow.  On to \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\", which in my opinion, is not their best.  HOWEVER, Tarja's voice, and Emppu's guitar (he is my hero.  *sigh*) make up for that.  \\"Nemo\\".  Wow.  What can I say about this song?  Tarja expresses such yearning, and the opening chords of Tuomas's keyboard make it a truly unforgettable song.  Every time I hear it, I just want to cry.  The lyrics are unforgettable:  \\"...One without a name, without an honest heart as compass....\\"  \\"Planet Hell\\" is a song that I couldn't get out of my head from the first time I heard it.  From the opening lines, the choirs, it grabbed me.  Then the orchestration comes in, builds to a crescendo, and then...it hit me.  BAM!!  Emppu, playing sixteenth notes on his guitar, Jukka on drums keeping the beat, Marco's pounding bass.  Then Marco begins to sing in his pleasant tenor:  \\"Denying the lying, a million children fighting, for lives in strife, for hope beyond the horizon...\\" Then Tarja joins in the unforgettable melody, her voice hopeful and yet with a chord of anger:  \\"A dead world...Behold this fair creation of God!\\"  All the while, Emppu continues his relentless mastery, Jukka keeps his assault on the drums, Marco's beat continues to pound to the bone.  The song builds and builds, the lyrics covered me in goosebumps constantly, and then the chorus:  \\"Save yourself a penny for the ferryman, save yourself and let them suffer...\\"  Marco sings, accompanied by Tarja and the choir.  This song...is amazing.  The keyboard solo in the middle, played of course by Tuomas, reminds one of Baroque composer Bach.    Just when you think that the album can't get any more beautiful, the opening lines of \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" begin.  This song is the tale of the Cherokees, and their famous Trail of Tears.  How Tuomas, a Finnish national, managed to reach into the very heart and soul of this incredible people is at the least, remarkable.  Tarja conveys a sadness, a longing, a beauty...unsurpassed on this song.  The chanting towards the end is unforgettable.  \\"The Siren.\\"  This song...how can I describe it?  It has so many surprising turns in it, including a violin solo, and the gorgeous lyrics:  \\"I hear but how will I see?\\"  Goosebumps, goosebumps!  \\"Dead Gardens\\" is unapologetically angry and sad.  \\"The story behind the painting I drew is already told...\\"  Towards the end of the song, Tarja's narrative is unforgettable:  \\"Have I felt enough for one man's deed...\\"  I thought the guitars at the very end were a bit repetitive (I seriously thought something was wrong with my CD!) (it repeats the same melody over and over again for about a minute!)but the rest of the song is fantastic.  \\"Romanticide\\".  Unbelievable the emotion that comes through in Tarja's voice.  The lyrics on this are beautifully done, except one part, \\"The feel is gone...\\"  Shouldn't they have said \\"The feeling's gone\\"?  Ah well, their native language is not English.  It's forgivable.  This song is relentlessly angry, and yet hopeful and full of love and desire.  I wouldn't expect any less.  \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is quite possibly one of the most lovely songs I've ever heard.  The orchestration on it takes my breath away every time, and Tarja's voice is, as always, expressive, resplendent with charm and lust.  The lyrics are some of the most gorgeous I've ever heard:  \\"- My fall will be for you, -  My fall will be for you, My love will be in you, If you be the one to cut me, I`ll bleed forever... \\"...Singing on the shoulders of an angel without care for love n' loss...\\".  The orchestration in the middle is surprising.  I found myself (an admitted \\"band geek\\") going, \\"Whoa, listen to that oboe!  What a gorgeous flute solo!  Was that a baritone?  Listen to that clarinet!\\"  This is the longest song on the album (a little over ten minutes), but well worth listening to (repeatedly).    \\"Kuolema Tekke Taiteilijan\\" is the one and only song on the album that is fully in their native language Suomi.  Don't ask me what the song means, though the title has to do with artists, but Tarja...I don't care what she's singing about, ever, she could make anything beautiful.  This song is soft, and it's mostly a song that shows Tarja's considerable artistry.  Not one of my favorites on the album, but still worth listening to and marvelling at.  And last (at least on the European version of this album), we come to \\"Higher than Hope\\", a song that I believe is about transgression and redemption.  There are allusions in it that can only be interpreted as Christian-influenced:  \\"An angel by my side, but no Christ to end this war, to deliver my soul from the sword...\\"  \\"Within the dark holds hard...\\"  \\"Higher than hope my cure lies.\\"  \\"Your death saved me.\\"  This song is a little soft (compared to others on the album), but the lyrics, instrumentation, and of course Tarja's voice lend it a beauty that is indescribable.  The two bonus tracks that are on the American version, I'm not going to review, although I own both versions of the album.  However, I will say this, both songs are gorgeous.    Altogether (if you're still with me on this long review), \\"Once\\" is an album WELL WORTH checking out, especially if you love metal, but also enjoy Baroque classical music and opera.  These guys have got a BRIGHT future (at least if they either bring Tarja back in the band or find someone as good as or better than her as a replacement!).  Four of the five members are under the age of thirty (average age is 27, if I'm not mistaken), but you would never know it from the music they create!

B00002E23E|3.0|I saw it in the theater, first run, the 1970's, really good performance, but the bits between sure are strange. What's nice about the DVD is it's easier to skip to concert footage. <br />It's worth it just for the concert footage.

B000025SJ8|4.0|Burzum's debut album definitely left an ugly mark (in a good way) on the black metal scene, as its primal fury still resonates through bands like Blut Aus Nord, Xasthur, and Leviathan today. By far, it's one of the most influential records to come out of the early 90's metal scene, but it isn;t quite Varg's best. His playing abilities are a bit questionable here, his vocals are in the embryo stage, and a flat production provides minimal atmosphere. In spite of these faults, Varg manages to pull through and forge a new type of dreadful, emotional, and unnerving black metal. <br /> <br />This album's raw production is the first thing the listener will notice. The garage drum sound, basic guitar overdrive, and makeshift production don't give this album the oppressive atmosphere of following albums. However, the rawness of the sound enhances the sheer emotion in songs like the long-winded opener \\"Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown\\", the short but sweet \\"War\\", and the epic \\"My Journey to the Stars\\". These songs convince the listener that Varg was dead serious with his creation. His wailing vocals were, and still are, unlike anything heard in black metal today. They are filled with pain, hatred, and agony, and would get even better on the next few albums. The drums are bare-boned, and the drum sound itslef is quite, well.. punkish, in a good way. Varg does a competent job on most of the songs, but there is a bit of sloppiness here and there, though it helps to enhance the atmosphere. <br /> <br />The best tracks here are definitely \\"Spell of Destruction\\", which would be covered by a million different bands, and the classic multi-faceted epic \\"My Journey to the Stars\\", which features some beautiful leads. \\"Channeling the Power of Souls Into a New God\\" is a relaxing, atmopsheric, and minimalistic synth track to relax the listener. <br /> <br />The Aske EP is only OK. It has a problem of being a bit too repetitive, and the lack of variety in the drums just makes it uninteresting. (\\"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\\" is almost painful to sit through.) But overall, this album's influence beats out its flaws. Reccommended to fans of old-school dirty black metal. For starters, check out \\"Det Som Engang Var\\".
B000002UR7|3.0|At the climax of my initial Radiohead frenzy, I purchased this as a bit of an afterthought. It has a bad reputation in the fan community as a piece of trite brit-pop with a handful of catchy tunes and a lot of fluff inbetween. Upon first listening, I wasn't even willing to give it that much credit - I almost sold it back (the only thing preventing me from doing so was an irritating completionist tic.)<br /><br />Before I begin to scrutinize the various aspects of this album, you should know that even though it is disappointing compared to basically everything the band has done since, it is still an enjoyable pop rock recording and serves as an interesting history lesson for Radiohead's development as a band. Also, there are a handful of great songs on it that make it worth buying if just for those tracks.<br /><br />Well, first the bad - it's clearly immature and derivitive in many cases. The music is nowhere near as emotionally investing as their later work, and many of the tracks are simply dull, repetative pop tunes. One major lowlight is the shameless disney channel tune \\"How Do You\\" - probably my most hated (and possibly only truly 'hated') Radiohead song.<br /><br />The album also suffers from a long string of dull, mediocre tunes towards the middle. \\"Ripcord\\" bobs back in fourth with inviting playfullness, and has grown on me more in recent months. However, the sequencing of the tracks brings out its shortcomings - following \\"Ripcord\\" is a nauseatingly cheesey rock ballad called \\"Vegetable,\\" which I tolerate at best. \\"Prove Yourself\\" has a nice melody and the chorus is catchy, but the overall effect of this string of tracks ruins the effect - by now I'm getting pretty sick of this album. \\"I Can't\\" is kind of nice but nothing special, and the accumulative effect of so many mediocre songs in a row is threatening to make me throw the CD out my window.<br /><br />However it is not without some great songs as well. It starts off with a bang on \\"You.\\" \\"You\\" is a Bends-worthy rocker and is many times more mature than most of what follows it. Perhaps I would like this album more if it had started with a lesser song - sometimes I feel the first impression made by this song set me up for disappointment. \\"Creep\\" of course is next, and is a pretty good song. The lyrics are a bit too blunt, but musically it is a very catchy and compelling tune. The \\"run\\" bit in the bridge still sends chills down my spine.<br /><br />The album ends similarily with two of its best songs, \\"Lurgee\\" and \\"Blow Out.\\" The former is a slow, emotionally nude ballad of sorts that I feel is severely underrated, while the latter is an atmospheric, jazz-influenced jam. There are a few \\"inbetween\\" songs as well; \\"Stop Whispering\\" is a good idea that doesn't really go anywhere, so despite its nice melody and texturing, it gets boring rather quickly. \\"Thinking About You\\" is another nice ballad but just doesn't leave a big enough impression to be a highlight. \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" sports the most interesting guitar playing on this album, and is sort of a high point, although the chorus is just a little too Jimmy Buffet to fit in perfectly with the rest of the tune which is considerably better.<br /><br />Overall, Radiohead were already becoming a great band by this time, but they simply dropped the ball on this album in a number of ways. The sequencing is crap, and the song selection is equally dubious: if you ever get a chance, hunt down the B-sides for this album. Most of them would have made better choices for album songs that half of the actual album songs. \\"Yes I Am\\" and \\"Coke Babies\\" in particular wipe the floor with just about anything on Pablo Honey (not to mention a number of pre-Pablo Honey demo songs that never saw release under the Radiohead name, some of which were considerably better than the stretch of miserably uninteresting songs in the middle of this album.)<br /><br />Basically, if more attention had been paid to the fine details, Pablo Honey could have been a respectable album in Radiohead's catalogue. As it stands now, it is more interesting for its historical perspective, a yardstick that shows the band's amazing capacity to develop and grow. Recommended for completionists and Radiohead fanatics, or people who are very fond of early 90's grunge/britpop. It requires a certain amount of generosity to listen to all the way through, but there are gems to be found so you may want to give it a chance.Pablo Honey could have been a respectable album in Radiohead's catalogue.

B00009W8N2|4.0|When this hit the metal scene in the early 90's, some were skeptical as to how the band would progress over the years, but this album shows incomparable promise for a group of musicians willing to stretch the limits and challenge themselves. Although their formula continues to evolve and blossom with each album, Orchid gives fans a valuable insight to Opeth's beginnings. Their blending of Gothenburg metal, atmospheric prog rock, and acoustic interludes was just starting here, and it shows that Opeth were still trying to find their own little niche. They did after a while, but this album is still quite good its own. <br /> <br />The first thing that jumped at me from the start of the album were the guitars. Mikael and Peter collaborate beautifully, switching off some truly beautiful lead guitars which seem to resonate off of each other and create a rather autumnal atmosphere. \\"In the Mist She Was Standing\\" and \\"Forest of October\\" are good examples of this, and feature some of the best solos the band have ever composed. Their displays of virtuosity are jaw-dropping, but not self-indulgent. Another thing that jumped out in particular were three riffs in the opening song that sound quite familiar... Oh yeah, they turn up on Morningrise! You betcha. Two riffs from this song were re-used in \\"Advent\\", and another was slightly re-written to be used in \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Screwy, isn't it? <br /> <br />The bass here provides a warm atmosphere, and even a few jazzy moments on its own. (See the beginning of \\"The Apostle in Triumph\\" and a mini-solo in \\"The Twilight Is My Robe\\".) Anders's drums are basic but fitting, and he throws in some intricate fills to help move along the song to its next section. Mikael uses a gritty, raspy scream here, which is quite different from what he does now, but its rawness aids the album. <br /> <br />Orchid's production is quite similiar to Morningrise. It has a slight reverb to it, and the acoustic guitars seem to shimmer. The guitars used atrebly but thick tone perfect for harmonizations, and the bass has a nice slap to it. Anders' drum sound is amazing, and the double bass gives even the weaker sections some strength. However, the overall sound is somewhat dry and hollow, but maybe that's just the studio. <br /> <br />I reccommend this to someone who is eager to the band's past. It does take a while to absorb everything, and a little fat-trimming on the song structures would have helped a lot. (Let's face it, the songs are almost TOO long, and Opeth never repeat a riff twice in a song.) Some parts a bit disjointed as well. But the songs \\"Forest of October\\" and \\"The Twilight Is My Robe\\" are among the best songs Opeth have made, and \\"The Apostle in Triumph\\" is a total classic. So, prepare yourself, because this album is anything but immediate. It takes repated listens with a good attention span to really get it. But once you get it, you'll love it... Parts of it, anyway.
1401308201|5.0|This is a must have for any \\"Wicked\\" fan. I enjoyed the book, and am addicted to the Broadway soundtrack. I bought my tickets to see the show over a year early (in California).  <br /> <br />The book may be missing a few things, but if you are looking for some great information about photos to aid your understanding and love of the show, whether you have seen it or not, this is a great buy. Don't miss out, every bookcase and coffee table should have one.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a masterful performance as the eccentric Truman Capote.  This movie actually is more about Capote and his writing of \\"In Cold Blood\\" than it is about the life of Truman Capote.  I guess I hadn't read enough reviews before I saw it since I wasn't aware of this.  I remember seeing the movie \\"In Cold Blood\\" as a child.  It was quite a great movie in it's own rite.  Capote was very enlightening and compelling.   <br /> <br />The movie starts with the discovery of the bodies of the murdered Kansas family in which \\"In Cold Blood\\" was written about.  From there we see how Capote works his way into interviewing the killers to begin writing his book.  The movie does a great job of conveying the emotion of everyone involved and what it does to life of Capote.  He becomes obsessed with one of the killers, Perry Smith, played wonderfully by Clifton Collins Jr.  He actually pays for the first of their appeals.  Capote battles his emotions as we see he actually does feel compassion for Perry while at the same time knowing the man won't talk about the night of the murders which he needs to complete his book.  It seems the only way he will be able to get his ending to his book is if the killers get the death penalty which keeps getting delayed with a series of \\"stays of execution\\".  Hoffman does an incredible job of portraying these mixed emotions.   <br /> <br />This is definitely one of the best movies of the year.  The performance of Hoffman alone is enough to see the film.  The fact that Hoffman in reality is nothing remotely close to Capote shows his acting ability.  Let's hope he gets his due at the Oscars.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I wasn't sure that Brokeback would make it here because of an extreme religious right but shortly after it won the Golden Globes it was announced: Brokeback Mountain would play a week later. <br />I saw the film last night and everything about it is supurb.  The story is as powerful as the cinematography.  I won't go into details about the story as many on this review page already have but, sufice it to say, that there is not a moment of this film you soon forget and every single person who sees it is moved in one way or another.  If one cannot get past the issue of two men falling in love they should at least be moved by the fact that love transcends everything including time and distance and circumstances.   <br />I have been listening to the soundtrack and the score is equally as moving and haunting simultaneously.   <br />If you get a chance to see this movie, do so.  If you can appreciate good works by all the cast and crew, buy it.  This movie will surely go down as an \\"American Classic\\" and change the face of tollerance around the world.
B000005RFQ|3.0|'Born Again' is not terrible but my god, what were they thinking? And I am not criticizing the band here, I'm taking about reputable metal experts and several Amazon reviewers who praise this album very highly. I don't get it! This is not a slam on Ian Gillan. This man is a legend but 'Born Again' was a misstep and I think he would whole heartily agree. It is not all bad, \\"Trashed\\" is fantastic! Great opener to a slightly above mediocre album (hence 3 stars). I also like \\"Keep it Warm\\", which seems more up Gillan's alley than many of the other poorer song choices. The lyrics are a joke so I can't fault Iommi whose riffs are their usual stellar quality. I guess Geezer also hated this record and caused him to leave Sabbath after the poorly received tour for 'Born Again'. Incredibly Tony would soldier on after this debacle with several albums for the rest of the decade under the Black Sabbath moniker. Again not a bad record but nowhere near anything from the Ozzy or Dio years. Gillan would soon join the reformed Deep Purple for another successful run with 'Born Again' behind him. Good metal album? Yes, probably but sure ain't no classic. Still worth a discounted pickup for the Sabbath enthusiast or the Gillan diehard but others beware.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have a new hero.  Captain Mal of star clunker Serenity.  This movie caught me by surprise.  My ex told me he'd heard of a great sci-fi movie and took me too it. We were still married at the time.  But since I only dream of Mal contently, he's left me to my dreams.  Just kiddin'  I dream of the whole cast of Serenity.  In my mind they are still out there getting into more mischeif with River discovering she has a love of flying and takes the wheel on more of Mal & Zooey's steal from the rich give to the poor adventures with Jayne bringing all his grenades.  Doc & kayleey staying behind to do anything but talk.  Inara staying close waiting to tell Mal how she really feels, maybe even having dinner done by the time they get back from a successful heist.  Really.  I can dream... After I saw the movie I had to rush out and buy the Firefly series.  I fell in love with this show and would even call myself a browncoat and follow these guys right back to space.  I did hate to see two of the shows supporting characters killed off in the movie.  Wash & Book were great and did the series credit!If you haven't seen the show.  YOU ARE MISSING OUT.  This is old west adventure set in the future.  Love the fact that ther is no swearing.  If you saw it and didn't like it, then you must be an extremely BORING person (yawn).  Joss I want to be there when you write the new series, hell I'll even help.  Please TV gods somewhere pick up the show and get it going again.  You did it for Star Trek.  (Speaking of the only other sci-fi you'll see real fist fighting was Captian Kirk)I hope we don't have to wait long.  Don't hesitate to buy the movie and the series.  You want be disappointed.  The writing, character buildup, creativeness, everything is great!  If I had 4 thumbs, they'd all be UP!  Kids are welcome to watch this show, however the TV series has PG 13 scenes not suitable for kids.
B00005JOIF|3.0|I was aware of the plot of this ambitious Steven Spielberg film.  It's based on the real drama of the assassination of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  What followed was revenge killings secretly supported by the Israeli government of the 11 known Palestinian assassins.  This aftermath is what this film is about.<br /><br />And so there is international intrigue and bloodshed and lots of money being changed hands for information.  What's never clear, however, is how the informants got the information.  Lots of other important details were never clear either.  And as we are watching the bumbling of the assassinations, the compromise the assassins had to make and the possibility of some of the wrong people being murdered, the whole film played out as a discourse on the morality of it all.  This took almost three hours and I must say that I found myself glancing at my watch.<br /><br />Eric Bana was cast as the team leader of the five Israelis sent on this mission.  He's a good actor and did a fine job as did most of the cast.  But with the exception of the actor cast as the bomb maker, none of them looked Jewish, leading to a loss of authenticity.  Also, as far as authenticity goes, if a film is set in an international venue, I expect the languages spoken to reflect that.  Yes, there were a few subtitles here and there, but mostly all the actors spoke English.  Some of this made me wince.  I was also surprised to see that not one scene was shot in Israel.<br /><br />I understood the moral choices early on.  After that it was just scene after scene of one kind of compromise after another.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I think there is a time and a place and a reason to debate the consequences of violence begetting violence.  This is the stuff of Talmudic discourses.  However, I'm not sure if this film succeeded in this mission.  We saw a lot of bombs exploding, gunshot wounds, and people being hurt.  And at the end of the film we knew that the hero would never be free of fear of reprisals.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile film.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  And yet it lacks so much that I hesitate to recommend it.at the hero would never be free of fear of reprisals.  <br /> <br />This is a worthwhile film.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.

B0007VZ9DK|5.0|I saw Casino when it first came out in 1995.  I loved the story, the acting and the violence.  It was on TV a few days ago.  Nothing else interested me at the time so I thought I'd just watch a few scenes.  After all, I had seen the film before and there were a lot of nasty commercial breaks to deal with.  Well, two hours later when it ended I was still sitting in my chair, the remote control still in my hand and I hadn't even channel surfed one bit during the commercials.  Without a doubt I was completely pulled right into the story, based on some real life people and events.  The fact that I had seen this film before didn't matter at all.<br /><br />The setting is Las Vegas.  The story is about the mob and based on some real events.  Martin Scorcese's direction keeps the action flowing.  The relationship between the stars, Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone, sizzles.  And the musical score enhances the action and keeps the story upbeat, sad and violent all at the same time.  Joe Pesci is cast as a bad guy you love to hate.  His cruelty is awful, and yet I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when he, too, became a victim of the gang world which he helped create.<br /><br />The story of love and money and corruption is a universal one.  There's not a bit of this film that felt dated.  I loved every moment of it.  And, even if you've seen it before, it's worth a second look.  Highly recommended.
B00009W0U4|1.0|It's not the gruesome violence or the rape that bothers me -- I believe that they are very fair things to depict in films.  What bothers me is that this is ALL STYLE and absolutely NO CONTENT.  What a lame script Noe wrote -- it reminds me of the idiotic short films that dumb males make in film school where they try to show as much violence and sex and rape as they can, then try to do something \\"different\\" (using storytelling methods that have already been done before but aren't too conventional) to pass it off as intellectual.  The script doesn't have anything thought provoking to say and the characters were ridiculously one-dimensional.  That to me is exploitation. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was beautiful and I loved the camera work, but that was pretty much the only thing that was redeeming about Irreversible, and I don't think it was enough to save a bad story.  And I don't really understand why the story needed to be told backwards... to show what if something irreversible can be reversed?  That's the best I can think of, and it's a pretty dumb reason.  I don't think it would have had any different effect if the story was told in order.  On top of that, the film could have been much shorter... but I guess that in doing so it would reveal it's mindless simplicity: random old guy talks about thermodynamics to another random guy (how time destroys things), then a man with another man kills his girlfriend's rapist brutally and his girlfriend had just found out she was pregnant right before the evil man raped her. <br /> <br />So to sum things up... Noe's film is nothing but a pretentious, masturbatory film which unsuccessfully does everything it can to hide it's lack of substance.
0307276902|1.0|I'm shocked.  I was a fan of his literary work.  I even supported him when the Smoking Gun first revealed parts of his deceit.  I wanted to believe in Leonard.  I wanted to believe there was some good people out there who have overcome their addictions to lead meaningful, purposeful lives.  I watched his mom as she sat there on Larry King and Oprah, she looked so sincere, caring, and motherly.  Meanwhile, she was protecting his lies, covering the truth all for her own greed for the money.

B000002BFZ|4.0|No code may as well stand as Pearl Jam's most unique effort in their entire catalog and by far their best. <br /> <br />Masterpiece? Sure isn't, let's leave those for Zeppelin, the Stones or the Velvets just to name a few and after all Pearl Jam has never been about masterpieces but passion for the music, supperb live shows, a grand sense of human solidarity and a many times proved love and fidelity to their fans, again, just to name a few.  <br /> <br />While not being a masterpiece it does show the band's greatness, <br />building slowly from the start(Sometimes),rocking hard with the punk rockish \\"Hail, Hail\\", showing reflectiveness in a \\"Lennon style\\"(Who You Are)and hell that's just the three first track on the record,not to mention the neat production on it. <br />flawless it couldn't be but the first half ranks easily amongst the finest music made in the 90's, and while songs like \\"Around The Bend\\" or \\"I'm Open\\" may sound out of place they do help enrich the album in it's diversity and experimentalism.  <br /> <br />Ten,Vs and Vitalogy may have had much more commercial success and a much more impassioned sounding to it than No Code did, thought this last one defined Pearl Jam as one of the richest bands both musically and culturally, where their first recordings sounded like a band reaching to the masses, No Code sounds like a band reaching to themselves, and in the process reaching to the fans as well. <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've decided that Serenity is the perfect movie. I received my copy of the DVD for my birthday and I have watched it over and over again ever since. I cannot get enough of it! It is hilarious, action packed, emotional and the special effects are amazing. This movie has something for everyone. Even if you are not into the \\"sci-fi\\" genre, you will love this movie I guarantee. It is a movie that can be watched numerous times without getting tired of it, which is a very special quality.

0740748475|5.0|So happy to have this come out.  Each strip is still as hilarious as the first time I read them decades ago!    As pointed out by someone previously it does omit some of the cute little sketches that were included (possibly as filler?) in some of the books and that's a bit of a shame, but really everything else is in here and is so well done and in such high quality it's hard to complain.  As others have stated, 2 of the comics which used to refer to adoption have been changed.  (If you read his 10th anniversary collection he kind of talks about how some people were offended by his lumping adoption and cannibalism.)  I will be keeping the 10th anniversary edition because it has introductions by him explaining his philosophy/motivations but otherwise I think this collection almost perfectly replaces having to have 14 separate books.    I love how each page is dated so you can read it chronologically!    The only minor flaw is what seems like 2 coloring errors. On Sunday, May 10th (I think '86 or '87) the second panel (where he says \\"Dead Worms\\") shows Calvin's shirt as white (all the other panels are in red as usual) -was this a misprint?  Then on Nov. 19, 1989 in the first panel Calvin's seen dressing in the usual striped red tshirt w/ a turquoise coat.  In the 3rd panel he's suddenly in a pink shirt.  Then in subsequent panels he's back to the red striped shirt & blue jacket.  With all the care they obviously put into this it seems a bit strange.

B00005JOIF|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />There could hardly be a film more relevant to our times than Steven Spielberg's \\"Munich,\\" the master filmmaker's grim and controversial rumination on how violence only begets violence and how the philosophy of \\"an eye for an eye,\\" when taken to its extreme, only winds up with two men who cannot see.  It certainly wasn't a \\"safe\\" subject for Spielberg to tackle, especially in the extremely sensitive post-9/11 world in which we live, but Spielberg has never been a filmmaker content to rest on his laurels and he certainly isn't doing so here.<br /><br />Based on the book, \\"Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team\\"<br /><br />by George Jonas, the film uses as its starting point the tragic killing of eleven Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Olympic Games.  To get revenge for the murders, the Israeli government secretly hires a handful of assassins whose job it is to hunt down and kill those responsible for the act.  Avner, the man chosen to be the leader of the operation, is forced to abandon his pregnant wife and later their newborn baby to perform his mission.  As the body count begins to pile up, Avner is forced to question his actions, becoming more and more morally confused, guilt-ridden and paranoid as the story develops.<br /><br />Spielberg has been harshly criticized for being too egalitarian and non-judgmental in his approach, for implying a kind of moral equivalence between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  I don't really feel qualified to answer those charges, but from an artistic standpoint, I believe the director has taken the right approach, for in art, moral ambiguity is always more fascinating and challenging than moral certainty.  Spielberg certainly generates sympathy for the Israeli athletes who are the first in the movie to fall victim to the bloodshed, and the Jewish individuals called on to exact the nation's revenge are shown as generally righteous men motivated by a desire for justice and concerned that innocent victims not fall prey to their violence.  It's true that the Israeli government doesn't fare nearly as well here, and it is in this area that Spielberg opens himself up to the most criticism.  However, this is something for the more politically inclined to deal with. Those of us interested in fine filmmaking will have less trouble with this aspect.<br /><br />For as a movie, \\"Munich\\" is a powerhouse of a drama, thanks to Tony Kushner and Eric Roth's thought provoking, intelligent screenplay and Spielberg's incisive, tightly disciplined direction.  The movie doesn't wander off into side alleys or irrelevancies but stays intimately focused on the characters as they go through the grim business of hunting down suspects, detonating explosives and even engaging in challenging moral discussions from time to time.  Spielberg makes every moment count, whether it be showing us the intricate step-by-step process through which these men eliminate their targets or capturing a man's moment of joy and anguish as he talks on the phone to the little daughter he's never met.<br /><br />As a humanist, Spielberg seems less concerned with heroes and villains than with the devastating toll escalating violence takes on both the individual psyche and society as a whole.  He seems to be saying that we're in all this together, and until we begin to acknowledge our common humanity, the peaceful world we all long for will never come to pass.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the one by Eric Bana, who, as Avner, manages to make a complex and morally ambiguous character both believable and touching.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is not an easy film for many in the audience to warm up to or sit through.  It demands concentration and a willingness to look at some of the harsh realities of the world we live in with an open mind and unaverted eyes.  But for those willing and courageous enough to do so, \\"Munich\\" is a provocative and richly rewardingexperience.richly rewarding experience.

B000301YY8|4.0|I like this CD quite a bit and understand why it has been such a success in the United Kingdom.  While I agree with other reviewers who have noticed similarities between James Blunt and the Bee Gees, Damien Rice and even Rod Stewart, I still think he has his own sound...one which I like.  And, as other reviewers have commented, some of his songs continue to play in my mind well after I have turned off the cd player.  To me, the best tracks are High, You're Beautiful, Wisemen, Out Of My Mind (the beginning of which is excellent) and No Bravery.  The last one, No Bravery, is the song I like best on the CD.  Upon first hearing, I thought maybe it was about the Iraq War, and subsequently read his bio to learn that he was in the British Army and served in Kosovo.  No Bravery is powerful, somber and disturbing, but very moving and a song of consequence.    Another interesting cut is So Long Jimmy, which is a bit different from some of the others.  It starts out with an almost Reggae beat, has some nice organ playing in it and ends with an electric piano that sounds very much like the one in The Doors \\"Riders On The Storm\\".    In all I like this artist and like the CD.  I recommend it and am a bit surprised at the negative reaction some have had to it.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is the music your Mum wanted you to listen to - a homage to a materialistic life in the sun, a life of smart cars, pretty girls and milk shakes, with not a hint of politics or protest.  \\"Be True to Your School\\" sounds like a parody today.  Hard to believe, but it was perfectly serious in 1963.<br /><br />If you have grown up with synthesized and electronic music, you will find it hard to imagine the impact of The Beach Boys' music when it was first released.  \\"Good Vibrations\\" in particular, created a sensation and a real sense that popular music would not be the same again.  There was also considerable unease when it was realized they could not create the same sound live on stage.  How times change.<br /><br />Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that not all the tracks have been remastered into stereo versions, but bearing in mind that it was often a deliberate choice to record them in mono originally (the fact that Brian Wilson was deaf in one ear might have had something to do with it), you could argue that it is wrong to rerecord them in stereo.  You're hearing what they intended.<br /><br />Their two main influences, Chuck Berry and The Everly Brothers, are very obvious in this compilation.  It includes a Berry song, \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" which I could have done without, but it does help to show where they came from musically.  They began as a fusion of hard rock and soft country.<br /><br />Also obvious is their affinity with The Mamas and the Papas - complex vocal harmonies, a love affair with California, a smooth, tuneful sound.  If you like one group, you'll almost certainly like the other.  No surprise therefore that this album includes \\"Kokomo\\", a late hit co-written with a couple of Papas.  Also no surprise that offspring of Boy Brian and Papa John went on to form Wilson Phillips.<br /><br />The traditional \\"Sloop John B\\" serves to remind us that the 60s folk revival influenced The Beach Boys as well as it did the more obvious groups.  Lonnie Donegan had already had a hit in the UK with this song, years before, and when the Boys' version was a hit, he re-released his, \\"Because there's renewed interest in it.\\"  Inevitably, his version bombed.  When all is said and done, The Boys were more rockers than folkies.<br /><br />There is a huge number of 'best of' Beach Boy collections to choose from, so you may want to shop around.  This album has 30 tracks, comprising their big hits, and is available at discount prices.  So I recommend this as your best single-disk choice.ups.

0446310786|5.0|Few books can claim to be in the same league as this one (\\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" comes to mind). It is a beautifully written story that through the eyes of child captures the stupidity of adult life, the dedication of man and ultimately the dignity of human beings. The girls naive questions, here longing for being allowed to do whatever she pleases and her fathers grand figure are so compellingly crafted that I was simply floored by the writers prose.<br /><br />We all know a Atticus, a Ewell and most importantly we all have bits and pieces left in our self that truly understands a child's bafflement over a complicated adult life. The parts within that never grooved up, that still becomes respectfully astonished with the life of our parents and the part that wants nothing but to play in the dusk of a warm summer night. This book reached in to my soul and touched a part of me that have been gone to long - from the time when summer meant playing, fishing and walking around in shear happiness knowing that life would always be like this, that my parents would never grow old and that I would live a happy life for ever. No other book has ever done that, it is simply amazing and to be read again and again. I would give it a thousand stars if I could.
0312305060|5.0|Cunningham follows the lives of 3 women (Virginia Woolf in 1923, Laura Brown in 1949, and Clarissa Vaughn in the present day) in \\"The Hours.\\"<br /><br />I often fine multiple threads difficult to follow, but Cunningham expertly crafts consistency throughout and I was not disoriented as we moved between the story lines. I found the unification of the storylines at the end beautifully brought the storylines together without being forced.<br /><br />Cunningham's strength is the empathy you feel for the main characters as you experience their lives, travails, successes, failures and death.  While Woolf and her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" are the intellectual inspiration and the undergirding tie of the book, familiarity with either is not required to appreciate this work.<br /><br />\\"The Hours\\" is clearly worth of its Pulitzer.  Excellent read if you are a fan of Cunningham's earlier works or if you are yet to experience his prose.
B000001IQH|5.0|This album is perfect if you want to get to know Rancid. <br />Every single song is catching, you'll love it after hearing the first time.  <br />So,if you like newer punk bands that still 'have it', buy this record.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Ever since the days of Derek Dick aka Fish back in the 80's, Marillion while under the influence of Steve Hogarth aka H, not to mention Fish's replacement, has taken Marillion and their legion of fans on an adventure ever since.   <br /> <br />Since the conceptual masterpiece which was to become Brave 10 years earlier, the band have returned for which is perhaps their finest work since that very album.  Afraid Of Sunlight was fantastic, This Strange Engine of 1997 also was very good, Radiation from 1998 was interesting and perhaps their weakest link.  Marillion.com which was to be released a year later was a slight improvement over Radiation yet still didn't seem to capture the spirit of Marillion to it's entirety.  Anoraknophobia which came out 2-3 years later was even more of an improvement yet again.  That was a step in the right direction to what was to become the concept of MARBLES!!! <br /> <br />Now the ironic thing is that this album was financed by many of their fans.  The fans wanted an album so vadly that they decided to donate funds for the band.  So the band simply didn't want to let their fans down especially as it wasn't their money.  And hey hey my my did they deliver. <br /> <br />Marbles is truly a album of sheer beauty.  I'll be reviewing the 2 CD Campaign Edition which is only available at their website [...] <br /> <br />Every song on this album stands out.  There is not even a weak song at all.  Notable favourites include The Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud, Don't Hurt Yourself, You're Gone (which hit the UK Top 10 at #7 much to their surprise), Angelina and Neverland. <br /> <br />Each member of the band plays their hearts out.  They really did not let their fans down including myself.  On the Campaign Edition set each of the fans that donated to the production of Marbles were included in the booklet.  Kind of something like on the Lord Of The Rings Extended Editions where the LOTR fan club members names were listed at the end of the credits. <br /> <br />Now if ever you get the chance, go get the DVD Marbles On The Road.  You get to see them perform the album live though it's only the 1CD version.  You really get to appreciate the album more in it's live environment.  I found it to be very moving. <br /> <br />Marbles is by far one of their finest works since Brave and I do find that it's going to be very hard to top that.  I look forward to another album for Marillion even if I need to donate something towards production.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album is just.. a classic. And that's what it deserves to be. <br />The Clash are one of my favourite bands ever, and London Calling is just a great record. With songs like 'Rudie can't fail' or 'Death or Glory', it never gets boring.  I always enjoy listening.
B00005AQE8|5.0|If I would say that this is the best 2Pac album, some 'Pac fanatics would agree and others would point to MAKAVELI or ME AGAINST THE WORLD as his greatest achievement in one album.  I tend to think that this album has all of the makings of a \\"perfect\\" album.  Sure, not every song is great on here (albeit \\"Whatz Ya Phone #), but the album is produced to a T and the lyrics are among his best.  Every song on here is produced excellenlty (surprising is Dr. Dre only accounts for two beats on both discs) and his metamorphisis as a rapper was complete.  He had transformed from the political-minded 20 year old from 2PACALYPSE NOW and became the thug-on-a-mission, hungry from jail time and being shot 5 times.  Throughout his whole career, 2Pac's genius had been in his lyrics, and out of 8 months behind bars we got the fresh vocals of a man who felt like he had nothing to lose.  His obsession over Biggie Smalls and BadBoy is present on these discs, however they complement the rest of the material nicely as they do not dominate the subject matter (like most of his posthumous material would).  The other Death Row Inmates help out in numerous songs, and the style refreshingly changes from song to song, unlike most hip-hop albums that will run one style to death.  For example, you wont find the same thing on \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\" and \\"How Do U Want It,\\" or between \\"Picture Me Rollin\\" and \\"When We Ride.\\"  And going against what seems to be popular opinion, I don't think the 2nd disc lags behind the 1st in any way.  Most of the singles came from \\"Book 1,\\" however do not sleep on songs like \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug,\\" \\"Can't C Me,\\" \\"Wonda Why They Call U Bytch\\"(great story telling in this one), \\"Picture Me Rollin,\\" and the other hidden gems on \\"Book 2.\\"  My favorite tracks overall include the aforementioned and classics such as \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,\\" Life Goes On,\\" \\"California Love rmx,\\" and \\"I Aint Mad At Cha.\\"  Again, the varied style on each track allows for this double album to flow smoothly and not get old or dull.  Another mark of a great album is its \\"re-playability.\\"  I bought this years ago and I still have not gotten tired of it.  Remember, most of the stories on here are NOT true, but they do reflect the things that he went through and places where he lived in his life.  Pac was a great storyteller, but he did not have a criminal record until he became famous.  This is not to discredit him, however, because he did grow up poor and living in the ghettos and saw things that would clearly affect him for the rest of his life.  His songs are a reflection of problems that plague projects and poor black communities throughout the United States, and it was his ability to resonate within the richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor that makes him truly the best rapper in history.  Unlike many contemporary artists, he truly did care about the welfare of African Americans and its communities which is what separates him from all others.  All in all, this is a great album, if not his best.  Great place to start your Pac collection.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I guess I was locked out in a cave, because in spite of having graduated from high school in 1989, today I saw \\"The Breakfast Club\\" for the first time. Laugh if you may, but I guess this opinion from an eighties child who is now 33 years old may help you decide to watch it too.<br /><br />The movie is now over twenty years old, and it doesn't feel old. The first half hour or so, you may feel like you're watching a teenage movie, but the plot thickens a bit as it evolves and the definite personalities of the five characters float to the surface, baring their souls to each other and the viewer. You will find yourself finding one (or more) of them with whom you will be able to identify with. In my case it was Brian (the nerd), but you may find you had more in common with the ones depicting the athlete, the basket case, the princess or the criminal.<br /><br />The performances are all extraordinary, but the true standouts were Emilio Estevez (the athlete) and Judd Nelson (the criminal), who were perfect for their roles and delivered some of the best lines overall. Now I know why this is a classic.
B0000035E7|5.0|I was truly blown away by this album when I first purchased it a few years ago. The sound of it does take some getting used to if you've only heard Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\" material, but this is by no means a bad thing. Every single track on here is downright beautiful. \\"Swap Meet\\" and \\"Negative Creep\\" blow \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" out of the water, and Teen Spirit was already straight from heaven. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Nevermind and In Utero, but most of the tracks on both of those are fairly uninspired (and by that I mean \\"Lounge Act\\" and \\"Rape Me\\"). A lot of the guitar work on here sound almost other-worldly, and the album as a whole is pretty dark -- and that's what makes it great. I have a really hard time finding anything I don't like on here.  <br />Nirvana's \\"Bleach\\" belongs high on the greatest lists up there with the classics like \\"Back in Black\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Unfortunately I don't think people will ever give it the recognition it deserves over the all-too-common Smells Like Teen Spirit.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I have to write this because as I glance through many of these reviews I can't believe how many people want to stomp all over Nickelback (the same happened to Creed and many others) - especially Michael Smith. It is his comments I am going to address. The \\"formulaic\\" rock label he gives Nickelback is what I have a problem with. I am not going to say he is wrong I am going to argue so what.  <br /> <br />As a music student I got into a conversation with my music literature professor about popular music. In that conversation she referred to popular music as nothing more than nostalgia music. I thought about this for a long time and that is the most proper title for radio friendly music. It is the back drop for each person's experiences - what is on the radio at the time. Talk with someone that was a young person during the `50s they may talk of Elvis or Dion, talk with someone from the `60s they might talk of the Beatles or the Monkeys - etc - and talk to someone today and they might talk of Nickelback. Individuals will usually vehemently argue that \\"their\\" music was the best. The thing is no one is right. Yet in every generation you will get the pious like Michael Smith who just don't get it and try to make you feel simple minded and intellectually inferior because you like music of this type. Sad really.   <br /> <br />All the above mentioned bands followed formula, even the almighty Beatles, though not always, most of their hits would fit the \\"pop music\\" formula. My teenage years were during the `80s with hard rock bands like Ratt, Dokken, Motley Crue, and the like. All followed formula, but I say \\"so what\\". Irony would have it that I too prefer more complex music, after all my favorite band is Dream Theater, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy \\"formula bands\\". I love them.  <br /> <br />So fight the urge to grandstand on your pompous platform and feel the need to look down your nose at those who enjoy bands such as Nickelback. While little of this type of music truly transcends the ages, its purpose is simply to enjoy in the here and now. With that in mind this is a great rock album, nothing less nothing more, so keep them coming Nickelback your time is now. <br />

B00005JNQA|2.0|Just got done watching The Interpreter and I must say, it just lacked something. I really like Nicole Kidman and think she is a good actress. I also like Sean Penn in most of the work he has done and Katherine Keaner. But this movie just wasn't that good. First I found no chemistry between Penn and Kidman which would have been fine if they wouldn't have tried to throw in this stupid connection or love story with them. If it would have just been cop and the person he was protecting/suspecting it wouldn't have been bad that they didn't click together. They for some reason decide that Penn, who has only met this woman a day or two before and thinks that she may be a conspirator and possibly an assassin, for no reason at all is going to bear his soul to this complete stranger about his wife being killed just recently and how much he loved her and wanted her back and that she was coming back (which they show you by having him listen to his answering machine with a message from her saying she was coming back right before she was killed and how much he despised the guy she ran off with). No we are suppose to believe that he would tell somebody he doesn't even know this and show this total vunerable side of himself to a stranger but we are also suppose to believe that even though he is grieving the woman he loved more than anything and that she has just recently been killed that he immediately is falling for a woman that could be a killer. This is just forced, stupid and adds nothing to story but actually adds more time and makes it even more bogged down. If it would have been Kidman being a master manipulator and playing on Penns vunerablilities and using him, fine. But this was just crap that hollywood feels they have to add so they can have some love story that doesn't even need to be there.<br /><br />The pace of the movie is also slow. There are also so many African politicians, rebels, security, bodyguards and FBI, Secret Service, cops, survielance and UN Officials and interpreters that were unremarkable that I had a hard time remembering who was who. Keaner was also underused and simply a character that could have been really interesting but was basically just somebody that could say, \\"are you alright?\\" and \\"you need to go home\\" to Penn every other time she spoke.<br /><br />Its worth watching once but I really wish I would have rented it and not bought it. I wouldn't recommend it. Not one of Penn or Kidmans best efforts but that may be because of the story and direction which was a suprise cause Sydney Pollak (who makes his usual cameo) is usually very good and right on.and interpreters that were unremarkable that I had a hard time remembering who was who.

B0000029GA|5.0|The first album that Nas ever released to the world is also his masterpiece. Illmatic is pure hip hop, no strings attached. This album is deep, gritty, and is packed with great rhymes. Production is flawless, Large Professor, L.E.S., Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and Q-Tip all lend their skills. Every track is perfect, this is one of my personal favorite hip hop albums of all time, an absolute classic. Your hip hop collection is not complete without this album and you can get it for cheap because its almost 12 years old. Nas never matched this afterward, but was still relatively solid. He's one of my favorite mc's and this is a hip hop gem. Trust me.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I agree with D.Berstoni (July 10, 2005) that E.W.S. is about honesty, but differ in the details of the analysis. <br /> <br />Note that the doctor consistently lies, not only to his wife, but to several others, and, most significantly, to himself.  His eyes are wide open, he thinks, but his professional expertise is contrasted with his naive knowledge of himself.  Even his fantasy of his wife's having sex with the naval officer is a lie, since it is purely a product of his insanely jealous imagination, and he lacks the honesty to recognize what is going on in his psyche.   <br /> <br />The doctor's  dishonesty is contrasted with the wife's honest description of her dream, while under the effect of pot.  She describes what she was willing to do, but did not do. <br /> <br />Another aspect of the theme of honesty is represented by the mask theme.  The masks cover up the rotteness of the doctor, but also the other powerful figures, his rich friend who was also at the orgy scene, and the ones whose identity we would be surprised to know.   <br /> <br />The film is about dishonesty in society, especially at the privileged and professional levels, where masks are a routine fixture.  That includes marriage, but is more extensive.

B00079HZUM|3.0|this is, i think, one of the finest acting job around today.  and i mean all concerned.  i have aproblem with this movie, however.  i can remember when gays were called fey and straights were called square, so you can see i have been around for awhile.  i think the first gay movie i had ever seen was \\"the boys in the band.\\"  i also am fortunate to have a signed copy and a letter for the author of \\"and the band played on\\".  i think the author was randy shilts who has since died of aids.  in those days the main character was always gay but at the end saw the error of his ways and went to straight.  while this movie is not exactly the same, the end result was the same.  first of all, i hate  the last name of crudup, i think i would change it.  what gives with that. <br />this really was an outstanding movie with the shakespeare dialog which i love.  my only complaint is the above and i have thought for some time we were through with these endings.  i knew almost from the start of the movie, how it would end and i was right. to see the gay movies of today, it seems most all the characters are happy in their skin, or pretty much accepting of it.  after seeing this movie i get the feeling we are going backward.  also seems to be aimed at the straight audience, which is fine.  anyone that doesn't understand what i am talking about needs to drag out the old harvey fierstein movie and check almost the last scene he has.  as anne bancroft as his mother, he tells why.  it is a great scene which every gay person needs to watch.  miss bancroft cannot understand why mr. fierstein seems to talk about the gay lifestyle way too much.  what a great scene.  other than that the movie is truly great, thanks to the two main actors.  anyway that is the ONLY reason i gave this 3 stars.  if this scene was omitted i would have given 5 stars for the acting alone.  when i see one of these redemption scenes i always assume it is there to make the movie more palatable to the public.  sorry i can't remember the names of some of the actors and the harvey movie, which we call it.  i do highly recommend this movie.  fortunately i bought it.  happy trails and remember this:  OLD AGE AND TREACHERY ALWAYS TRIUMPH OVER YOUTH AND SKILL.

But as many big movie companies are spending millions of dollars to show you F/X all along, this one has genuine frightening moments and is at the top of its class. <br /> <br />Herk Harvey personally played \\"The Man\\" and is very good at it, Candance Hillgoss is a little out of place here, because almost everybody in that movie over acts, but so what.

0141301120|5.0|For the sake of briefness I'll use the following abbreviations:<br /><br />CATCF - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory<br /><br />CAGGE - Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed both CATCF and CAGGE.  Being an adult reader I was glad I suspended my cynical \\"the sequel's not as good as the original\\" approach and decided from the outset to just treat myself to some easy - and delightful - reading.<br /><br />Possibly the only part which dragged for me was when some of the grandparents were being (like magic) made younger then older then younger again in the latter part of the book.  But this is a minor complaint, and this part was quickly followed up by a surprise which came at the end, which I won't spoil.  Suffice to say that Charlie and his friends are rewarded for their good deed in the earlier part of the book.<br /><br />The illustrations in the copy of CAGGE that I read were by Michael Foreman, whereas those in CATCF were by Quentin Blake.  Both admirably done, in my opinion, but this gives the books a different \\"feel\\" from one another.<br /><br />Something I noticed was said in CAGGE appeared in the script of the original film of CATCF, which you'd miss out on noticing if you didn't read CAGGE.  That is (p11) \\"'We must hurry!' said Mr Wonka. 'We have so much time and so little to do! No! Wait! Cross that out! Reverse it!...'\\"  (I haven't seen the new film, but am looking forward to getting a chance).<br /><br />So, in short, here is another classic from Roald Dahl.  It is heart-warming and thoroughly worthwhile.

( I owned songs for the deaf, and downloaded every single, and a whole bunch of random songs.)  I didnt know if an entire DVD would entertain me.  I saw them recently on tour, And they are Incredible. The live accuracy of the (ever-evolving) band was perfect.  You hear almost EXACTLY what they have on their studio recordings.<br /><br />Luckily, their album sounds, and live show COLLIDES into this wonderful set of discs.<br /><br />During the first batch of songs(\\"Flow\\" through \\"little sister\\") I felt like all I did was spend $15 bucks.  But at some point I finally realised I was completely engrossed. A Perfect balance of familiarity and Improv.  And of course, the DVD goes on for TONS of songs after that!.  I Wish I could come up with a fault of this recording. But there isn't any. Great Sound,  Good Song selection, Awesome Visual/Angle Imagery.<br /><br />It also has alot of Hilarous crowd interaction and Clips<br /><br />If your just skimming this review, This is a Great DVD/CD set. The Sound Quality is listenable, not like cheap LIVE recordings. PERFECT for putting on in the background. And ABSOLUTELY AMAZING to sit down and watch with the lights dimmed, maybe a couple drinks. = )
0307276902|1.0|While the story line is interesting, events are fabricated with events embellished to make the author appear as a hero. Now that falseness of events is discovered by TheSmokingGun.com website, the author has stated that his book is not 100% accurate after all!. This has resulted in Oprah Winfery embarrassment. \\"I really feel duped,\\" Winfrey told A Million Little Pieces author James Frey who appeared on that show. \\"But more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers.\\" She added.    Sadly the author has marketed the book as an autobiography not mentioning it had a lot of misstated facts. The story includes a lot of deviations, for example, many characters in his book are fake. When confronted he mentioned \\"All the way through the book, I altered details about every single one of the characters to render them unidentifiable,\\" the author confessed recently. However, no part of the book mentions this disclaimer, instead this statement is being put in the flap of the book:  \\"AMLP is uncommonly genuine account of a life destroyed and a life reconstructed.\\"     I gave the book one star because the book was being mislabeled as a non-fiction.

She never stops making excellent music that inspires and touches the soul....this CD in particular is a real winner.  I actually consider it a blessing that she is not on the radio where her music would become mundane and ordinary.  Instead it's only by hearing about her through others that people have the privilege of listening to her wonderful music where you just can't get enough and it just makes you feel good.  She's the best and there's no one else out there like her.  That's a good thing!

But if you choose the wrong color you must choose until you get the right one. <br /> <br />The Making of Sleeping Beauty - A sixteen minute making of featurette with classic footage from the vaults. <br /> <br />Story -  <br />The History of the Story: A written history of the story from early lore to the ballet to Disney. <br />The 1951 Outline: The original film outline written and read (23 minutes). <br />Storyboard Sequence: 2 two minute sequences that show the storyboard with the actual film. <br /> <br />Production -  <br />The Music: 3 minute featurette with Mary Costa (Aurora) discussing the music. <br />The Design: 3 minute featurette with Pocahontas animators discussing how the unique production design was created. <br />Creating the Backgrounds: one minute interview with background creator Eyvind Earle <br />Live Action Reference: A staged sequence that shows how the animators would use actual people to choreography movement. An actual filmed sequence with drawn in effects for another scene and live action photographs for various scenes. <br />The Restoration: A 3 minute featurette that tells about the extensive restoration of the film. <br />Widescreen to Pan-and-Scan Comparison: A four minute comparison of the 2.35 original theater aspect ratio to the 1.33 television screen aspect ratio.  The scene used is Once Upon a Dream widescreen above the full screen.  It is surprising to see the difference.  Even when all the action is caught in the full screen, the extra animation on the widescreen adds to the sequence. <br /> <br />Sleeping Beauty Galleries - <br />Layouts and Background Galleries: A series of original concept sketches for the backgrounds with certain layouts and backgrounds having commentary. <br />The Sleeping Beauty Storybook Gallery: The book used for transitions is shown here with each transitional page. <br />Poster Gallery: 15 different posters and lobby cards used in advertising the film over the decades <br />Disneyland Walkthrough Gallery: This is the Eyvind Earle original concept art for Sleeping Beauty's Castle at the entrance of Fantasyland in Disneyland. <br />Concept Art Gallery: A series of original concept art sketches with certain concept pictures having commentary. <br />Character Design Gallery: Five character design galleries similar to the concept art gallery. <br />Storyboards Galley: Same as the above with Storyboards. <br /> <br />Sleeping Beauty Scrapbook: Various stills broken out between Behind the Scenes, Publicity, Merchandise and Theme Parks. <br /> <br />Four Artists Paint One Tree - A 16 minute segment of the TV show Disneyland that talks about animation using Sleeping Beauty.  (Disney often used his television show to promote upcoming films.) <br /> <br />The Peter Tchaikovsky Story - A 30 minute live action short subject on the life of Tchaikovsky was originally used on TV show Disneyland, as part of a larger show promoting Sleeping Beauty.  Later released theatrically as a short subject. <br /> <br />Grand Canyon - A 29 minute Oscar Winning Live Action Short Subject which was paired with Sleeping Beauty in its original release.  I remember seeing this many times in school.  It is stunningly beautiful.  The music is The Grand Canyon Suite.  You are going to have to click through a number of screens to get to this but find it.  It is worth the effort.   <br /> <br />As you can see, this DVD is chocked full of extras.  Some fantastic and some just okay. <br />
1400043662|3.0|I really liked the first half of this book.  In the second half, it got needlessly weird, characters went away and/or completely changed personality for no good reason, and it just plain got difficult to WANT to read it.  Don't get me wrong, I got completely wrapped up in the story--which is why I think I'm disappointed with it.  In a trend common to today's writers, the ending is vague and doesn't wrap up all the loose ends--obviously the author hoping for a sequel--and the proverbial gun in the story never seems to be fired.  (A common quote actually USED in the book, \\"If there's a gun, eventually it will be fired.\\"  Let's just say there's a whole, metaphorical, non-loaded arsenal here.)  It's a good read, but not worth a re-read...and the ending is disappointing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My other half brought the FIREFLY SERIES home having found a single copy at the video store and we watched and were amazed by this storyteller.  Funny, ironic, very much Joss and we loved it and couldn't wait for the movie to come out to see it.  Somehow we missed this series when it was on television and are truly sorry we were not able to add our votes for keeping it on the air.  Now, with so much more apcrae on t.v. in the form of the reality shows and such, with a zillion commercials, we find it very difficult to watch much network television.  FIREFLY was and is a wonderful series to watch over and over and we do as everytime it is watched we find something new we missed when watching the series previously.  A great buy if anyone who enjoyed the writing on Buffy and Angel missed FIREFLY, it is something to be enjoyed over and over even if you do not normally watch DVD's repeatedly. - Sandra & Johnnie
B00005JOII|3.0|I really like Woody Allen, particularly when he sticks to what he does best, namely writing comedy. His most recent endeavor aptly titled \\" Match Point \\" was a good attempt to prove to the audience that he is quite capeable of writing drama/thriller movies too. Sadly his efforts, though noble , proves that he isn't a good writer of drama nor thriller. The script sounded unnatural and forced. The acting was poor all the way around. It felt as if the actors were just going through the motions. The editing was very bad and choppy. There were so many scenes that should have been deleted from the movie. The movie jumped around too much. On top of it at the end of many scenes there would be a pause as if the director decided to yell \\" cut \\" too late. It was uncomfortable to watch. I think it is ok to see this movie but only once.
B000AM4PBS|3.0|Friends was an entertaining show with characters you cared about that was able to keep a dedicated and loyal fan base for ten seasons -- an enviable achievement for any sitcom. Shows like Bewitched and The Cosby Show limped lamely to the end of their runs and should have left the air years before. But Friends stayed on top for its entire run. For that, Friends deserves its good rep.    However, when NBC, during Friends' final season, started bellowing that its was \\"The Greatest Sitcom of all time,\\" I balked (especially since Frasier ended its run at around the same time). I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, All in the Family, Maude, The Bob Newhart Show, MASH, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Sanford & Son, Cheers, Seinfeld, The Simpsons, Frasier and Everybody Loves Raymond, to name a few, deserve that title more. Enjoy Friends for what it was, but don't buy into NBC's hype. Friends isn't the greatest sitcom ever -- it's a good, solid show and there's no shame in that. But for greatness, check out the shows I listed.
0783219733|1.0|I found nothing to like about this movie and I can't believe people actually take children to watch it. The father is an absolute jerk and I wanted to smack the mother, who stands like an imbecile while her husband says ugly things to the dog and kids. The filmmakers attempt to redeem him and show what a loving father he is by beating someone up! Riiiighhttt. Throw in a sadistic veterinarian and you have a horror show, not a family film. This is completely unfit for children and should be for adults as well.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Man I like all the lyrics on this album, not to mention the music and I love her soothing voice.  I read reviews for hints. If you are into meaningful, soulful, listen and appreciate... I have never purchased this style of music, but it was put on my MP3 player at work and when I wanted something with  relavance, there she was, Norah, my new found inspiration.  Try her, she will not disappoint.
B000002UA5|1.0|Why can't musicians just give up this artsy fartsy garbage and get back to making music that matters. While admittedly these guys bring some rock to the table on the live disc, most of it devolves into a psychadelic mess and they don't realy guitar solo very often. The studio disc is where they loose their audience completely. Plus there's not a single song about hot girls. If you can't make a ROCK album that ROCKS then stay the hell home you wankers. Not recommended for fans who like to ROCK. Buy some oldschool Bon Jovi instead.
B00018D44U|5.0|I love Norah's \\"sound\\", she is young and I look very forward to listening to her in the years to come.  Her first album was great, this one is not quite as rapturous, but, she deserves to express herself and grow and we in turn need to listen, learn, and appreciate.  I look forward to her next endeavor. Go Norah!
B000B8QF14|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have been a follower of rock music for 40 years. I taught high school and I remmeebr students that were big Green Day fans in the early-mid nineties. <br />I thought they were ok; but kind of a retread of earlier punk rock bands. I saw them as trying to ride the tails of Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam and Nirvana. <br /> My 14 yr old son bought this DVD/CD combo after Christmas. I had liked the songs I've heard from American Idiot so I watched it with him.I have to say that the DVD grows on you. The first time, I came away thinking it could have been edited and produced better. It has too many quick flashes between blac and white and color footage. That is the only thing that keeps  me from giving this 5 stars. <br /> <br />  The dvd impressed me from the standpoint of the energy that the band puts forth onstage, how they get the audience so intensely pumped up and how charged  they are musically.  The best clips are \\"Jesus...\\"; \\"Are we the waiting/St Jimmy\\" and \\"wake me up...\\", but honestly none of the concert footage is bad. <br /> <br />  Now about the CD version.It is the best live CD/Album I have heard in  probably 20 years. I would compare it to U2's \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\" and better then the Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\". There are only 2-3 Live albums that even come close to embracing the inensity, breadth and emotion of this collection. <br /> <br />  In closing, I think that American Idiot is just starting to hit it's stride as a great rock album. I think that when more people in their 30's and beyond hear about it, there will be second and third wave of consumers of this very important album. <br />There are alot of young people out there that fit in some shape or form the image of Jesus/St Jimmy. I congratulate Green Day for bringing it to this country's attention. <br />
B000002J27|5.0|Superb album!  I didn't know what to expect when I heard that Gabriel had left the band, but I eagerly waited to see how Genesis would follow up \\"The Lamb\\" (Yes, I'm that old!).       I was not disappointed.  Phil did a wonderful job on vocals, and the rest of the band sounds great (except for the fact that we almost never hear much from Steve Hackett, who is one of the best, and most underappreciated \\"prog\\" guitarists ever!).  Banks is, as always a bit overblown with his keyboards, but this is some tunefull stuff!     The whole album is just fine, but standout cuts would have to include \\"Dance on a Volcano\\", \\"Entangled\\", \\"Squonk\\", \\"Ripples\\" and the title cut.     While one can see the seeds of where Phil Collins and Tony Banks would eventually take the band, there are enough nods to Gabriel-era Genesis (the BEST Genesis!) to keep old time fans happy.  Wonderful effort from the guys here.
B000683VI4|3.0|I saw the movie, then read the book and rewatched the movie.  I have to say that the book is so much better for the following reasons:  1.  The love scenes in the movie especially the second one are not romantic at all.  In the book Noah and Allie reunite in front of the fireplace after some quiet conversation. Which makes their love seem deeper than just a physical attraction as betrayed in the movie.  2.  The ending scene of the 1940's when Allie comes back after talking to her fiance, the scene in the book has Allie talking to Lon about how she cannot marry him not agreeing with him that she should marry him like in the movie.  Also in the movie, the way Allie returns it almost makes you think that Lon didn't want her so she didn't have anywhere else to go i.e, the way she gets out of the car and shrugs her shoulders like here I am.  I wish they would've stayed truer to the book in those two respects. I do however, like the ending of the movie better than the book even though it is unrealistic, it is hopelessly romantic when present day Noah and Allie die together in their sleep.
B00006EXDM|5.0|If you're like me, then your one of those people who understand why the Rolling Stones are so great, but you won't go out and buy every one of their albums.  This album is perfect for you if you're like that. It is essentially a greatest hits album. It contains all their greatest hits from 1964-71, which is basically a greatest hits of all time from them. A hardcore stones fan would argue that, but for someone like me, its perfect.  This album contains all the songs that you would hear on the radio, even some that you may not hear. Be sure to get this one, it's a must have for any fan of rock.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I put in the disc and was instantly blown away!  Awesome remix, vibrant, rich, no discernable hiss...  SURROUND!!!!!!!!!  GOOD SURROUND!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Worth every penny and more, WOW!  Time and care was put into this release and I'm not surprised.  Or maybe I am, in today's cut'n'dirty world of \\"get it out as cheaply and as basic as possible\\".  Worthy items are worth paying for.  This is one of them. <br /> <br />And I'm listening to the Advanced Resoultion CD side right now.  I'll be trying the DVD side on my 5.1 theatre later on, but if I'm impressed right now... <br /> <br />Now if only they'd release the B-52s albums in the same format...

Of course not. Oprah, in her desire for integrity, should rescind the award, the only way she can retain her credibility. And Frey deserves to become a pariah. <br /> <br />
B000BYA5G4|3.0|\\"Lord of War\\" is a black comedy cum morality tale about a fictional international arms dealer, purportedly based on several real arms dealers, whose path to wealth and substantial market share takes him to hot spots around the globe through the Cold War and ensuing free-for-all. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) immigrated to Brighton Beach from the Ukraine with his family in the 1970s, where he had the revelation, after witnessing a mob hit in a restaurant, that, just as people will always have to eat, they will always have to kill. After selling guns to local mobsters for a while, he realizes, \\"The real money is in actual wars. Between countries.\\" Shunned by the big-time arms dealers who operated with the CIA's blessing during the Cold War, Yuri turns to the gray market with his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) in tow. Idealistic Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) becomes his persistent pursuer.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is told in biographical fashion, with Yuri delivering a biting, witty voiceover narration about his adventures in the arms trade throughout the film. The narration is smart, ironic, and funny. But it is delivered with droning lethargy by a self-loathing, vaguely regretful Yuri. This exemplifies \\"Lord of War\\"'s fatal flaw. Writer/director Andrew Niccol doesn't like his protagonist, hates guns, and probably disdains political violence in general. What's worse, Yuri is telling the story, so his own angsty, guilt-ridden delivery reflects his director's bias. Imagine reading a novel that is narrated in the first person by someone who can't stand himself. You will have a pretty good idea of what it's like to watch this film. Yuri is an interesting character who has a provocative story to tell. But he tells it with bored detachment, acute self-loathing, and without a trace of the salesman's vigor and sheer nerve that it took to sell weapons to the world's scariest war-mongers. Arms dealers are not, in reality, burdened by excessive guilt. Yuri enjoys his business, and he's good at it. Yet he refuses to act like it.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is ultimately critical of the arms trade. That's fine, but Andrew Niccol allowed his socio-political agenda to hamper his strengths. He wrote a smart, funny narration and then was afraid to let us laugh at it. The arms dealers and their ultra-violent clients are absurdly comical, but the film tries to shame us out of laughing at them. One minute, Yuri's commentary struck me as hilarious; the next minute I am being told that guns and killing is a very grave matter that only immoral people would make light of. \\"Lord of War\\" goes back and forth like this, constantly undermining itself. I commend actor Eamonn Walker for playing bloodthirsty Liberian President Andr&eacute; Baptiste, apparently based on deposed President Charles Taylor, with such gleeful viciousness that I couldn't help laughing at him. He seemed to understand that Baptiste was nuts but also completely ridiculous.  I like \\"Lord of War\\"'s script a lot. But it needed a more energetic lead performance and a director who was willing to make an all-out black comedy. People would get the message that the arms trade is unethical even if Yuri liked his job and relished his accomplishments. There was no need to emasculate the guy and bore the audience.usiness, and he's good at it. Yet he refuses to act like it. <br /> <br />\\"Lord of War\\" is ultimately critical of the arms trade.

B000002AS3|5.0|While Oasis' second album gets more attention, \\"Definitely Maybe\\" may ultimately prove to be the most influential work the band ever did.  \\"Definitely Maybe\\" has a raw, straight-ahead rock n roll sound.  It is meant to be played loud.    If there is a theme to the album, it is about wanting to be a rock star.  Being a rock star is obviously something to aspire to, but at the time \\"Definitely Maybe\\" was released, this seemed to be a novel idea.  Thus, the sense that Oasis \\"saved\\" rock n roll.    Though Oasis makes rocking, shagging girls, and doing coke seem like a lot of fun, they also show considerable emotional depth with songs like \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Slide Away.\\"  This is the other side of giving up your life for rock n roll: you might never become a star and end up a bum instead.  Throughout their career Oasis have juxtaposed their hard, arrogant edge with vulnerability, but they probably never did it better than on this album.    The idea that Oasis sound like the Beatles has always been overstated, but especially so with reference to \\"Definitely Maybe.\\"  No one who listened to this album would pick out the Beatles as the number one influence.  There are many influences here, but if I had to pick a major one, it would be the Kinks.    People who think they know this band and haven't heard this album are in for a treat.  It is easily one of the best rock albums of the past 15 years.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|After you've gotten over how awful the cover is (which is strange as the inlay book is quite well done), you'll be propelled into the world that is so uniquely Maiden. The opener, Wildest Dreams, is my least favorite and I must say had me worried. As Rainmaker blasted forward, I was relieved. It is one of the best tracks on the album (and one of the best Maiden tracks in a while). Dance of Death, Paschendale, Age of Innocence (for those who love Maiden melodic) and Journeyman are also way up there and will be instantly adored my fans. Not their best, but more than enough moments to warrant repeat listens.
B00006WUWQ|4.0|Austin Powers International man of mystery is one of the funniest and most original comedies ever created. Mike Myers at his best. <br /> <br />The Spy Who Shagged Me is also hilarious. It feutures two new fantastic characters (Mini Me and Fat Bastard), still incredibly funny. <br /> <br />Goldmember is the clear least of the three. It is still somewhat funny, but it doesn't compare to the first or even the second. Pretty much all of the jokes are either recycled from the first two or laughlessly blue.
B0000AUHPK|3.0|What would probably give you a pretty accurate idea about this movie is the curious fact that each (but one) of the 30+ reviews I read - some were extremely positive and others just as extremely negative - made a point I couldn't disagree with.     Like many people said, the 1992 version was hauntingly faithful to the atmosphere of the book. It did have just the right sets and cinematography. It did feature the most Wuthering soundtrack that could ever have been composed. Ralph Fiennes did do a fabulous job capturing Heathcliff's essence. I could go on.    At the same time, like many people said, the script was rushed, choppy and less than friendly to people not familiar with the book. Juliette Binoche was BADLY miscast and Bronte's original lines were often butchered into overly sentimental drivel. I could go on.    My guess is no future adaptation will manage to match this one's soundtrack, its Heathcliff, or its overal look and feel. It's all the more disappointing then that a movie with so much genuine potential and great choices managed to very effectively undo everything it did right - completely right, as far as I'm concerned. Still, it's well worth seeing, not to mention hearing (I'm referring to the OST).     Should you need more examples of the odd mix of brilliance and inadequacy this adaptation offers before vieweing it, just keep reading the reviews. Chances are each is correct. And speaking of customer reviews, I need to comment on one review in particular. Generally, when people read a 2 page work starting with \\"I'm not a Bronte fan. Decidedly not. Her work amounts to a 19 century soap opera\\", they assume the person who wrote it is familiar with the writer/work in question. That being so, the user called \\"A. Joseph Haschka\\", prolific a reviewer as he's proved to be, should avoid making references to, let alone mocking at, books he admits to having never read. It undermines the validity of whatever point he's attempting to make.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|This DVD rocks from start to finish.  Scorcese provides a comprehensive portrait of Dylan in the broader context of the tumult of the 1960's and his Midwestern upbringing in Hibbing, Minnesota.  This is sprinkled with interviews with the Bard himself, who comes off more lucid and humorous than one might have expected.  However, what elevates this to 5-star status is the superb footage of Dylan performances through the years, from the early \\"protest\\" songs to his seminal 1966 UK tour.  The full-length version of Dylan singing \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" on the 1966 tour is a brilliant display of an artist at the peak of his powers.  A must see for any Dylan fan and a good primer for those who might not understand how this ambitious folkie from the North Country became a rock and roll icon.
B00006FDCD|3.0|To start off, I'd like to say that I read the novel this is based off of. The novel is quite good, however I'm well aware that movie adaptations of novels are never oscar-winners. <br /> <br />That said, watching this movie really hurt me sometimes.  Seriously.  The acting was...beyond awful most of the time.  The kids were actually a little better than the adults, although only because they're allowed to over-act a little bit.  For the adults, there's no excuse. At all.  They're just BAD.  The first time you see them staring bravely off past the camera, it's a little annoying.  The fifteenth, you want Pennywise to come back and eat them all.   <br /> <br />To be fair, it's not all their fault; the script was really, really bad too.  I mean, come on.  Stephen King writes GOOD BOOKS. Couldn't he have at least proofread the script?  Once? Please? <br /> <br />So yeah. Bad script, bad acting, pretty bad changes from the book.  So why 3/5 stars? <br /> <br />Because it's freaky.  Sometimes.   <br /> <br />Mostly, Tim Curry was awesome as Pennywise, and there were some genuinely frightening parts to this movie; most of the scenes of horror were very effective overall, except for the ones that weren't pulled out of the novel.  (Cough cough...the ending). Even if the actors looked like they were being left by their wives rather than witnessing something terrifying most of the time, it works for the audience.  It really does. <br /> <br />Except the ending, of course. <br /> <br />Finally, I am tempted to drop this down to 2 stars because of the HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE attempt at recreating the romance triangle thing between Ben, Bev, and Bill.  As children and as adults, it left me feeling more annoyed than anything.   <br /> <br />But it gets 3 stars anyway, because of Tim Curry.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the story of two all-man cowboys that find love in each other. The film is unique because it is not the typical gay stereo-type; perhaps it is the first mainstream film ever made on this topic?     Ennis Del Mar (played by the very talented Heath Ledger) is a very quiet and rough around the edges kind of man. He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).      What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of \\"Titanic\\" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.     Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool. And it was evident that Ennis loved Twist when he sobbed like a baby on the street after they departed Brokeback Mountain separately.    The cinematography in this picture was absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is also amazing. I am certain that this picture is very Oscar-worthy.    I saw this movie about a month ago and I still can't get it out of my mind. It is a very full-toned and haunting picture. To say that it was the very best film that I have ever seen would simply trivialize it, because it is much more than just a movie.
0307276902|3.0|I read this book before all the brouhaha.  I bought it because I was beguiled by the cover, something that rarely happens with me.  The book was a quick enjoyable read, but so over the top in some places that I found myself shaking my head and going: \\"Yeah, sure, uh huh.\\"  I find it hard to believe that Oprah and everyone else didn't feel the same.  But no matter what, it's still an entertaining read.
B0000048CX|5.0|An excellent album. I am a fan of \\"I Can Hear The Heart Beating\\" and \\"Then NOthing Turned Into Somethin\\". This cd is entirely different. Yo La Tengo pulls a complete 180, and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff. It has a misty, thematic feel to it, a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals. \\"What Comes Next\\" evokes the Byrds, especially their \\"Notorious Byrd Bros.\\" phase. An excellent buy, sit back n enjoy.
0307276902|5.0|So what if James Frey changed a few facts and details about the book.  The overall \\"truth\\" of the book still resonates strongly, and that is that he was a severly addicted person, who received help, and has been clean for 13 years.  I never understood how a person became addicted, or if they wanted it bad enough how they could not stay clean.  I understand now.  He made it real for me, and I will forever look at addicts differently. <br /> <br />Before everybody judges and condemns him, watch him on Larry King Live, I thought that explained himself fine.  Should he have changed facts?  NO.  But what he changed DOES NOT take away from the book at all.  This book is about addiction and recovery, not how many days he spent in jail.  NOBODY is disputing the fact that he was, is still an addict, and that he spent time in a treatment facility.  The crust of the book is about his time in Hazelton, and his experiences there.  Only 18 pages and a few facts are in dispute, and he explained those already. <br /> <br />So, I recommend this book to everyone.  Read it knowing that some things have been changed.  If you ever wondered about the life of an addict this will open your eyes.
0307276902|3.0|I was in the middle of reading this when the controversy about whether or not it was a memoir and its purported exaggerations and falsehoods surfaced.  One thing I remember thinking before was \\"How can he remember so much detail of a time when he was going through drug and alcohol detox that was 10 years ago?!\\" <br /> <br />  I decided to keep going because like another reviewer I thought it did have its moments.  But the style in which he writes is very annoying, no paragraphs, no quotation marks, random capitalization, etc.  It is for that reason I won't be reading My Friend Leonard.  A lot of it just seemed cliche too...very TV movie of the week.

B00000GAIW|5.0|ALthough I have enjoyed individual songs from this album for over 30 years, I never owned it, I only just recently bought this CD. It is a wonderful album, and maybe one of the 10-15 best albums of the '70's. I do want want to delve into the thematic concerns of Ian Anderson, as other reviewers here have done so very eloquently. What I will say is that this is a great CD, many of the songs are staples of classic rock stations, but the CD transends that status. If you are curious about Aqualung - buy it   - you won't be disappointed; don't wait over 30 years like I did. <br /> <br />At the same time, the remastering evident here is more than a little stange. While the hiss and rather tinny sound on unremastered Tull recordings is absent; there also seems to be some \\"presence\\" missing on some tracks. I suspoect the desire to eliminate tape hiss led to some of the liveliness of the sound being diminished. Additionally, most remastered CD's I have play loudly - this one has the volume unusually low, so you will need to crank your stereo up higher than normal to enjoy what is contained herein.
0307276902|2.0|I think this is all very interesting.  I remember when the book first came out,there was an excerpt from the beginning pages on Amazon, where he describes himself on the plane--how low he had gone in his life.  I was not interested, I was turned off by the disingenous sense that he was trying to portray himself as tormented, while all the time getting a sense of self satisfied pride in showing off his own debasement--unfortunately a common theme in some autobiographic writing, etc. When I saw the Oprah segment when the book and Frey were showcased, I decided to give it a try, thinking there may be some genuine depth and inspiration in his story, and it was not just be a case of showing off.  How ironic, that in fact Frey was MAKING UP the degradation to make himself more than he is.  It is definately a commentary on our culture that a person would fabricate their own debasement in order to offer themselves a sense of accomplishment, street credibility, pride what have you. <br /> <br />I knew there were parts of this story that seemed unrealistic:  the constant throwing up,with no serious physical repurcussions; describing himself before treatment as being alienated,isolated, etc., yet having many friends and acquaintances from before treatment be in his life, and not having a particularly difficult time adjusting and socializing, etc, etc, etc (yes, I read his second book too). This all rang false for someone who supposedly was at the low he claimed. <br /> <br />This is too bad...I do not find any value in his story knowing that all of this was made up--what a waste of time. Maybe at least this will be a lesson, and we will get more truth from writers, publishers, etc.--then maybe we will be offered more examples of real introspection,inspiration, and triumph.
1400079276|4.0|All in all, Murakami doesn't disappoint with this latest novel. He has a knack for handling the surreal and making it seem plausible, and using that to explore those feelings and moods in life that are incredibly hard to put into words. The plot carried me along, and it was hard to put the book down a few times when I had other things to attend to. The character Nakata could have really been botched as a monotonous, boring, or else sentimental character if handled by a lesser writer, but Murakami gets it just right. Kafka Tamura did seem a bit too mature for a 15 year old, however. I kept picturing him as in his early 20's despite myself. But overall the characters are convincing enough and rather memorable.<br /><br />There were a few rough spots, though, where the characters made Murakami's literary devices a bit too explicit, as if he doesn't quite have enough faith in his readers to get the point. Similarly, even though several of the characters are avid readers, some of the dialogue gets a bit stilted in spots--just a  shade away from being pretentious. These are of course minor flaws in an otherwise excellent work. Murakami is perhaps starting to get self-conscious about being \\"taken seriously\\" as a novelist? If so he shouldn't--he continually writes some of the most profound, freshest stuff out there.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|Lord of War follows the exploits of Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian immigrant to America in the early 1980s.  Yuri decides to get into the gun-running business when he sees an attempted assassination of a ganglord one day in his hometown.  The movie follows Yuri's story over the course of 20 years.  All the highs and lows of the business, and the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not an action adventure.  It really is more of a satire; a serious, violent satire, but still a satire.  Somehow, the movie allows, even encourages us, to root for Nicolas Cage's ruthless, exploitative character.  Yuri is a good, deep character, who is aware of his flaws, but he is also aware that gun-running is the one thing he is good at, and he is not so willing to give it up.  Nicolas Cage is obviously a talented actor, and he does a good job here, but nothing that he hasn't done the basics of before.  Jared Leto, who plays Yuri's brother, Vitoli, does an admirable job of playing a distressed, drugged-out, morally aware sidekick to his brother's illegalities.  The best character of the movie, though, is agent Jack Valentine, played by Ethan Hawke.  Valentine appears sparingly, but the scenes that he and Cage share are the best of the movie.  The verbal sparring between the characters is extremely well-written, and has a deep meaning that runs underneath the entire film.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie expecting nonstop action and explosions, watch it for the ideas that it expands on, and the moral dilemmas it exposes.  The film asks many questions, and the answers are complicated.  But one thing is for sure: I enjoyed watching the questions get asked.
1400031087|1.0|Somebody should have told James Frey that if you're going to tell a lie you're supposed to keep it simple.  As I read this book I kept thinking, \\"this is just TOO much.\\"  The sad thing is that people are going to question legitimate and powerful memoirs that ARE true.  Unfortunately the controversy will keep the book on the bestseller list even longer as curiosity seekers check out the hoopla.
0553801503|4.0|This book resembles the second book in a traditional trilogy and for good reason. The introduction of new characters and plot elements that will be important in the rest of the series has slowed the action and the story does not move forward as it did before. The author is in the middle game. The ease of the opening, where the moves are predetermined, is gone. The swift pace of the endgame is yet to come. With that in mind, it is possible to sit back and enjoy the new characters and situations without jumping up and down, yelling \\"What happened to TYRION.\\" Possible but not easy. <br />In addition, the decision to devide Volume Four into two parts means that we are only seeing part of the story. While it does come from a publishing decision and not the author's decision, it is the main reason I am happy giving the book only four stars. I expect that the other half-volume will be transitional also and some will be dissapointed.
0920668372|5.0|First i want to say that if you think this book is 'wrong' and 'disturbed' your reading too much into it.  this book is written for children, are you analyzing it as a child or as an educted and sophisticated adult?  this book shows teh life cycle and what a REAL and TRUE love really is and feels like.  it teaches children that mommy is always going to love you for who you are.  Even if your the child who throws watches down the toilet or rocks out with you friends, no matter what your mother will always love you.  A WONDERFUL book!

(and i like oprah!)  just read it.  you won't be disappointed.
B00009UW0N|5.0|The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and one of my dopest favorite. Even though I've seen it numerous times I can't get enough, on Halloween night in 1963, 6 year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc amongst the trick or treaters. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still slithering creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie. If you only see one horror movie in your lifetime, then fire up a blunt, kick back and see this absolute classic again, Halloween.

B000000XB9|5.0|CCR specialized in rootsy pop-rock: Touches of R&B, blues, and rockabilly stewed with a Nawlins flavour and embellished with John Fogerty's gravelly drawl. If you listen to oldies or classic rock radio, you've heard these songs so I won't spend a lot of time detailing what they're all about.<br /><br />Absolutely EVERY one of the band's Top 40 hits is here. On that score, there's nothing else that needs to be said. If you want their chart hits, they're here..ALL of them.<br /><br />My only quibble...a very minor one...is that 1 song, their cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\", wasn't really a chart hit. I applaud them for filling the CD space, but if they were going to judiciously choose a single track to complete the disc, \\"Born on the Bayou\\" (also not a chart hit but still popular) would have been the obvious choice. The fact that that song ends up on CHRONICLES, VOLUME 2 feels like Fantasy's attempt to force the average fan to pay up another 10 smackers to get it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />You want a comprehensive overview of every hit Fogerty and Co. had as a band?

B00005KHEU|4.0|I have read countless times of how jeff lynne had sold out ELO to disco.(Discovery). ELO has been bashed many times even when the best of their music have proved masterful. these critics have grown worn and old while ELO's music has aged like fine wine. making one drunk while soothing the soul and putting a smile to ones face. \\"Discovery\\" is not and will probally never be the best ELO had put out, but it's appealing in sound and feel. to understand what jeff lynne was trying to do with this album, you have to understand that this was ELO's eighth album. Lynne had already proved what he could do with this group. He had just come off with two of the bands most popular albums, he had experimented with so many different sounds. Along comes Disco, a genre that many so called pure rock fans dismissed as trash. these souless tunnel vision air heads could not stand to see and artist take himself to another level and life in music. jeff lynne has done this with \\"Discovery\\" and other latter ELO music that has also been criticized. For myself \\"Discovery\\" is Amazing and near flawless. \\"Shine a little love\\" and \\"Last train to london\\" may have a disco sounding beat to it,as he calls it a \\"Dico very\\" sound. but it's the best. Lynne Stays away from turning his music into the bee gees, but takes just enough of this once menacing sound to suite his purpose. \\"I need her love\\" opens with what sound like a space ship landing, Followed by a guitar riff that digs deep into your heart, just as deep as the lyrics to this rare unconditional ELO love song. the string orchestra is not as prominent,just as the other songs on this album, but when the orchestra hits, it hits like a heavy weight champions money punch. \\"Don't bring me dowm\\" is hard rocking and most people's favorite from the album, but \\"Midnight Blue\\" shines! You want a classic ELO song, here it is. Like the album, this song has been over looked. It stands toe to toe with other classic ELO songs like \\"Telephone line\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\". Just this song alone shows the preciousness of this CD. \\"The Diary of horace Wimp\\" sounds off bells reminiscent of Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture\\" and it's just as rousing as it is sappy. Who but Jeff Lynne Can give you sappy and make you love it. \\"Confusion\\" shows just how far ELO had come to this point, Lynne gives off vocals that sounds as if his chilhood days of music are over and demands that you listen to this adult. But as you listen it becomes all to clear that he is mourning the chilhood that he has put to death. \\"On the run\\" is as different a song from the band as you will ever come accross. With a mock begining followed by a soulful bass sound that captures it's time and innocence. \\"Wishing\\" Sounds like an eerie ghost story, and makes you wonder if maybe the love he's wishing for is accually six feet under. Along with great music \\"Discovery\\" has probally one of the great album covers of ELO, depicting what seems to be an early muslim's discovery of an mysterious glowing ELO emblem. but what makes it even more great is the depiction inside of the CD, that has the same character hopelessly running for his life on foot in the dessert with a grim face and the ELO emblem tucked against his chest, while three men on horses with swords in hand,and looks as if they mean buisness and to take the mysterious magical looking emblem for themselves. The scene is one of despair. There's no way our hero is escaping his death. We will never get the full story of our doom hero. or if our hero is really a theif and deserves death.I would like to think ELO's \\"Midnight Blue\\" was being played threw the magical emblem during the chase, and Just as the hero was about to get his head choped off. Electric Light Orchestra just took a new direction. The love and feel of the music only got if not better, certainly bolder. No one got hurt, only people who refused to grow with time and music. these are the ones holding on to an emblem and about to get their heads chopped off.
B00005JOFO|5.0|After reading many of the other reviews it became clear there is a common misconception that Jack & Ennis returned annually to Brokeback Mountain to rekindle their relationship. In a beautifully crafted run-on sentence in Annie Proulx's short story she names all the mountains & ranges they traveled to in their times together over 20 years \\"but they never returned to Brokeback Mountain\\". In the film it's easy to see how everyone thought they were returning every year when Jack, in an argument with Ennis at their last meeting, gestured behind him & said 'all we have is Brokeback Mountain'. Brokeback Mountain remained for them iconoclastic, the only uncomplicated time in their lives, a time of unfettered love; when they felt as if they were the only 2 people in the world. After that summer they both moved on to marriages, children & in Jack's case, other men (which was probably the start of his downfall in Texas, word getting out in the rodeo circuit). But neither man felt any contentment or fulfillment with anyone else & after 4 years had an explosive reunion, unfortunately witnessed by Ennis' wife, Alma who had never experienced that depth of passion from her husband. Alma knew from that moment on that each time Ennis sodomized her (that 'thing he liked to do' started early in their marriage) he was recapturing the only real happiness he has known by taking his wife the same way he took Jack. Jack wanted to always be with Ennis from that point but Ennis, with his obligations & societal fears couldn't do it 'I like doing it with women but it ain't nothing like this, this has got no reins, it scares the piss out of me'. When Ennis sent Jack a message he was divorced, Jack joyfully 'redlined' it 1,200 miles to Ennis thinking they could finally be together only to find he had been mistaken. Again, Jack's heart was broken. Ennis, even at this point could not allow himself to move beyond his fears, terrified to live openly with another man; all Jack wanted out of life wasto be with Ennis- willing to take the risks. Ennis felt he was protecting both of them from `the tire iron'. There was a light that shone from Jack that's heartbreaking to watch each time his hopes were dashed. Ennis always loved him deeply and didn't fully realize that depth until he found the 2 shirts from their Brokeback Mountain days carefully hidden by Jack years ago in his boyhood home- now too late to reach out for Jack. Ennis didn't realize until too late that Jack could have given him true lifelong happiness if he would have allowed it- he now knew Jack was the love of his life. There would never be anyone else for Ennis & this realization came with bitter grief, loss & remorse. 'Jack I swear', the last line in the film, said through a few stinging tears, probably meant that if he could he would hold Jack tight, never letting him go away again saying \\"it's all right, it's all right\\"- just as Jack had always said to him when Ennis was troubled. For Ennis, finding those shirts obviously cherished by Jack, the stark realization of what he lost came crashing down on him, possibly realizing he may have, by denying Jack all these years unwittingly started the wheels in motion for Jack's death; a co-conspirator with Lureen. Jack was right, all they had was Brokeback Mountain. Truly a masterpiece, the film left me emotionally drained, took days for the full impact to hit & when it did, found myself bereft & grieving for these 2 men, 'as grieving as the high northern plains'. <br /> <br />
1577311523|4.0|To paraphrase Tolle, words cannot express the concept of light to a blind man or the smell of a fragrant bloom to one who has no sense of smell. So how can our infinitesmal minds comprehend the reality of the awesome God concept. <br /> <br />Tolle attempts to use words and the mental understanding of concepts to show the path to enlightenment. Yet he is critical of the human mind itself because of all the games it plays with us. <br /> <br />To the seeker of enlightenment words, concepts and thoughts will only provide an \\"idea of the taste\\" of chocolate. If the seeker wants to eat the chocolate and better understand the meaning of \\"I am that I am\\" or \\"Be Still and Know that I am God\\" the seeker must EXPERIENCE it for themselves. <br /> <br />There surely are many methods to still or calm the mind. One that I recommend from experience is the Vipassana technique. It is simple. It is pure. It does not need attachment or devotion to a Guru or teacher. It does though require 10 days of quiet practice. It will bring you into the NOW and hopefully bring you, as it did bring me, the \\"peace that surpasses all understanding\\". <br /> <br />Give Vipassana 10 days. It will be the beginning of the rest of a full life. For more search on Google or visit [...]
B00005JOIF|2.0|The closing scene of the movie pitches up a 1970's New York skyline with the Twin Towers clearly visible - what does this mean?, is it saying the terrorism is inevitable and violent means to try to stop are futile?  Does it means that the methods to combating terrorism portrayed by the movie - selective assassination - were not aggressive enough?. If the focus of this movie is to get us to think about our reaction to terrorism then I believe it is not clear enough.  If it is to focus on the effects of carrying out selective assassinations on the perpetrators, then I think it is too wooden and bleeding-heart.   <br /> As a movie there are some good points - the recreation of 1970s cityscapes is excellent - where did they get all the cool cars?  However there are significant plot flaws - who are the French guys who keeping supplying information to the Israelis about the whereabouts of the Terrorists?  Wouldn't you think the Palestinians might  become suspicious?   The French are presumably arms dealers, but the leader -`Papa' is shown as having a big family and we are treated to some stereotypical nonsense about the Papa's love of cooking and meals in the garden.  The actor who plays `Papa', did almost the same strange routine in the movie Ronin, only this time he gets to talk about cheese and truffles instead of Japanese warrior-dolls .  There is another scene where the Israeli hit team inadvertently share a safe house with a PLO team, and they talk.... Give me a break....This whole scene should have been cut.... later of course they exchange gunfire.   <br /> There is a good acting performance from Ciaran Hinds, who plays a middle aged agent who is realistically conflicted about his role.  Eric Bana - the lead actor - also emerges well, I think.  As an actor he has an uncanny ability to emerge from dreadful movies with his reputation unshredded; he did well in the Troy movie despite its being a complete Turkey [ yes, intended].   He manages to hold our interest through the movie, despite there being up to an hour of excess dialogue.   Poor Geoffrey Rush seems to have kept the glasses from his Peter Sellers movie, he plays the Mossad controller of the hit team, but I kept expecting him to break into Dr. Strangelove voices.  Almost every Israeli general was played by someone who escaped from the home for bewildered wooden acting - one poor guy gets introduced by Geoffrey Rush's character as \\" this is General so-and-so, from the army of the North\\", he hugs Bana, says \\"well done\\", smiles and leaves. That's it, the guy manages to make it look like he's a plumber moonlightling in the movies. <br /> There was room here for a better story - the sets were good, the tension was evident, there was even a flicker of humour :  Bana's character was let loose in Europe with unlimited funds, but being a government operation, we see him being warned to `get receipts', as he initially  meets his French contact he is asked what he needs for his mission, his answer is `I really need receipts'.  More of this could have moved this movie along.   <br />Speilberg is trying too hard for balance here - which is  just impossible with this topic, it would have been more realistic to give the characters white and black hats and get on with it.  By concentrating too hard on a message (which message?) the dialogue becomes wooden,  everybody - PLO, Mossad, mothers, wives, politicians, the French -  talks about homeland, justice, sacrifice ,and the spark drains from the film   A pity about this movie , it seems a sincere, but confused attempt to split the difference in a polarising topic. <br />

The death toll on both sides in both battles was horrific and, as in every war, included a great number of civilians.

B00005JNX0|5.0|This is what happens when you choose top talents all around to make an animated film:  you get a tight story, likeable and distinct characters, great dialog and a quirky but state of-the-art look.  What's more, the adults as well as the kids are entertained.  All this and more went into the making of Madagascar. <br /> <br />Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) are fast friends in a New York zoo.  We presume they have lived there all their lives because it's obvious that none of them are aware of the natural order of predators and prey.  They are also every bit the pampered New Yorkers that any celebrity humans of the city are; they live on schedules, customized diet plans and adoration.  For the most part the animals are quite content with their urban lifestyle, except that is for Marty.   He dreams of what it would be like to run free in the wild - or at least his fantasy version of the wild that he gets from zoo murals and publicity ads.  So one day, he orchestrates his own escape just for the heck of it, and his friends must follow in order to, uh, save him.  It was a disaster all around, but it got the attention of animal rights nuts, which ended in all of the animals heading on a ship for a wildlife preserve in Africa. <br /> <br />To make a long story shorter, the penguins had plans of their own and they hijacked the ship for Antarctica.  The four animal friends were jettisoned overboard accidentally and then drifted off course to the island of Madagascar (which they mistake for the San Diego Zoo).  This is the setup for some of the funniest misunderstandings and comedic moments of the movie.  Was the wild everything that Marty was hoping for?  Can Alex get over the loss of his star status now that he has competition from a lemur king - and more importantly, where is he going to find a steak in this freaky new place?  And, will Melman and Gloria be able to keep them all out of trouble? <br /> <br />As far as I am concerned, Madagascar is the best family film since Toy Story 2 (which my kids watched nearly every day for a few months, once upon a time.  I know, it's just horrible of me!:).  Everything was superbly done, from the big name stars' voices on down to the minor characters', the design of the animals, landscapes, etc and the little details that went into the animation. The humor worked through dialog jokes on the adult level (but never inappropriately) and visually for the kids.  The whole experience had LOL moments and a sense of fun and delight.  And of course it was impossible to resist the adorable but not syrupy lemurs and penguins.  I can honestly not find one thing to fault or criticize about this movie - splendid job! <br /> <br />Dvd extras include interviews with the cast and creators, which I found fun and interesting.  Madagascar is without a doubt one for your permanent home collection.  Enjoy. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />
B000001F6S|4.0|The first wave of the British Invasion exposed many young Americans for the first time to the sound of the Blues through the interpretations of such luminaries as the Animals, the Rolling Stones, and the Yardbirds. And over time, many listeners delved deeper into the Blues to discover the roots of these Brits. Some of the great blues artists that emerged as prime influences included Albert and B.B. King, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, and others. Virtuoso guitarists like Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, and the late Mike Bloomfield reflected these influences in their guitar work. What makes \\"Undead\\" such an interesting album is that Alvin Lee's guitar playing displays completely different influences that seem to be more Tal Farlow than Elmore James or Freddy King. There aren't a lot of tunes on this recording and, in fact, Lee's vocals, such as they are, are eminently forgettable. But, let's face it, you don't buy a recording by Ten Years After for the vocals. Highlights on this album include \\"I May Be Wrong But I Won't Be Wrong Always,\\" \\"Woodchopper's Ball,\\" and \\"I'm Going Home.\\" These are truly the numbers that Ten Years After built its reputation upon. Each of these tunes allows ample time for Lee and his band to fire off energetic solos at unbelievable speed. For many of us, \\"Undead\\" was our first exposure to Ten Years After and most of us became avid fans after hearing Lee's frenetic riffing, which seemed based more upon horns than the traditional blues guitar styles. If you love the guitar, this is a great album to have in your collection. This is a high point for Alvin Lee before he descended into self-parody by replaying his signature riffs over and over again later in his career. Points off also on this recording for self-indulgence (there is such a thing as having too many guitar solos) and lackluster vocals.
B000AYELVA|3.0|The X-Men movies are fantastic. The first being wonderful character-developing platform which re-launched the comics-to-film genre after Warner Bros killed it with the horrendous \\"Batman and Robin\\". The second being the typical rollercoaster action event with little plot, but multi-layered fight scenes and huge explosions.<br /><br />Fox's greed at cashing in on X-Men is rediculous. X3 comes out this summer, and fan furor will peak again, but why would fans want a bare-bones disc? especially considering most people have the two disc sets already (the original X-Men release and the 1.5 release) a third release is downright insulting.
B000005ZGZ|4.0|Fugazi, along with NoMeansNo, are pretty much the only innovative \\"punk\\" bands left in the music world today. Whereas once punk was eclectic & vibrant, it has now become a cartoon, loaded with Bad Religion and Green Day sound-alikes. Amazingly, Fugazi have completely transformed their sound and still been able to remain interesting. Gone are the dub-style bass lines, the amped-up funk drumming and the choppy power riffs. This would be the death knell for most groups, but Fugazi get away with it. Instead, I now hear a band that injects artiness and experimentation into their rock-out jams, as well as exploring their more ambient, spacious sound. \\"Break\\" is a classic Fugazi album opener, displaying a tightness that only comes with years of playing together. \\"Foreman's Dog\\" starts off with some classic rock riff, but quickly delves into a mid-pace display of tricky guitar lines. It also features the best example of their contrasting dual vocal stylings. Guy Piccioto has a sinister, minor-key delivery and a lyrical obsession with body parts, while Ian MacKaye delivers anthemic choruses and themes in his sing-songy yelp. Their songs are deceptively simple. The band aren't the greatest musicians, but have the inventiveness to take their limited abilities and combine all these simple elements into unique compositions filled with time changes and unusual chord progressions. The instrumental \\"Arpeggiator\\" sounds like it should be the theme to the Charge of the Light Brigade, it has a familiar feeling to it, like you've heard it before in a classical music piece. \\"Recap Modotti\\" is a laid-back, moody number that could easily be used in a movie somewhere, featuring bassist Joe Lally on lead vox. The band is light years ahead of any of their contemporaries. Even their fans have to catch up to the band's constant, gradual style transitions. \\"Guilford Fall\\" utilizes feedback and droning one-note chords, but somehow remains catchy as hell. Granted, songs like \\"Floating Boy\\" & \\"Pink Frosty\\" go nowhere, but as long as Fugazi keep one-upping themselves, even the lacklustre tunes become bearable. I'm totally not into their personal politics, but they are to be admired for doing whatever they feel like, fans and foes be damned. It's as if they knew that they'd eventually lose a large chunk of their fan base whether they sold out or not, and decided to at least amuse themselves. They've gone from rhythm-driven crowd-pleasers to more guitar and vocal based aural soundscapes. The rhythm section is more subdued but still very involved, ocassionally breaking into their well-worn, but still fun, formula (see \\"Five Corporations\\"). \\"End Hits\\" & \\"Red Medicine\\" are worlds apart from their debut ep's & \\"Repeater\\", and the end results of this evolution have been staggering. It's almost like one great band has split into 2 amazing bands. Fugazi are an awesome group that have been criminally ignored, due to their refusal to affiliate with corporate-driven labels and radio/video stations. Instead of taking the money and running, they've stuck to their guns and become an important piece of musical history. Give them a chance. It'll take a few listens, but when they grow on you, they are a pleasant surprise in the copycat music world.
B000BNX3B4|4.0|I have now watched this movie three times and I<br /><br />still don't understand what some reviewers<br /><br />dislike so intensely about this movie.<br /><br />I love Jake, John Cusack's character.

B00008J4P5|5.0|This wss a new venture for Jack White what with the bass for the first time. I don't think there is a single song that I don't enjoy on this album. I can honestly only say that for a few select groups. Please keep them coming.
B000006NPY|4.0|This album was one of intrigue. I feel that it very much sums up the year 1998. Dark. <br />TO SHEILA - one of the best songs on this album starts it off. acoustic, almost a confession. \\"you make me real\\" <br />AVA ADORE - i like this song, and especially the lyrics. it's a lot harder than the rest of the disc though, so don't expect to get 'more of the same' <br />PERFECT - i don't like the arrangement or production here. i would have liked to see an acoustic version. the version on the record seems almost forced in its context and doesn't fit the rest of the album. definitely a good song though. <br />DAPHNE DESCENDS - okay song. good production. fits the mood of the album well, but not particularly standout. <br />ONCE UPON A TIME - a good song here, the first to directly mention his mother, who he lost before recording this album. i like it a lot. pretty personal. <br />TEAR - that's like \\"tear me apart from you,\\" not a tear rolling down my face. i like this song a lot. spooky as hell. about the loss of someone. <br />CRESTFALLEN - excellent song, one of the best on the album if not THE best. lyrically, very introspective. musically very melancholy. great vocals. i wish it had been an actual piano instead of the gay electric piano though. <br />APPELS + ORANJES - horrible. horrendous. avoid this song. <br />PUG - great song, especially in the dark at night on headphones. <br />THE TALE OF DUSTY AND PISTOL PETE - i like this song, but it's not one i listen to regularly. i like the sentiment here though. \\"why can't she miss him?!\\" <br />ANNIE-DOG - supposedly, this song is a scathing portrait of courtney love, but i don't know the validity of that. i always liked the simplicity of the song. a kind of jazzy (although that word really isn't fair) take. enjoyable. <br />SHAME - recorded in a day, according to BPC2. the adore documentary had a really great ambient guitar part james was doing for this, but i find the album version to be somewhat of a disappointment. weak lyrics, some would argue. i like it sometimes though, and some people have told me it made them fall in love with the band, so.. <br />BEHOLD! THE NIGHT MARE - great song, but don't really like the arrangement here.  <br />FOR MARTHA - along with crestfallen, one of the best songs on the record. about his mother, with very personal lyrics. great piano work, some of his best, having just learned to play a couple years previous to this. amazing guitar solo as well, and very disconnected vocals, as if he's singing just to his mother, actually. touching. <br />BLANK PAGE - weak arrangement makes this otherwise good song somewhat boring. i do like the vocals though. the piano is just ruined with that muffled echoey thing going on though.  <br />17 - the melody of \\"blissed and gone\\" played on a piano for a few seconds. the poem in the booklet is ripped off of the cure song \\"seventeen seconds\\".. not like half of billy corgan's \\"work\\" isn't ripped off of billy corgan anyway, but.. totally cheap, i must say.
B000000OSE|5.0|just listen to November Rain...it makes me cry every time. Remember the good old days? this one will remind you!I wish they would ge back together and tour one more tme.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|okay, so Brendan sounds similar to Patrick from Fall Out Boy.  we get it, seriously.  and it's sort of true.   but end of story.    it doesn't mean the BANDS or the SONGS are the same, which is whats important.  i happen to think that Panic! At The Disco is much better than Fall Out Boy, but thats just my opinion.  (another similarity is the really long song titles that don't actually appear in the song at all, but honestly, who cares??) <br /> <br />i honestly love this cd.  it's the best debut album i've heard for years and i'm quite impressed.   the lyrics are clever, the beats are great, and the songs are ridiculously catchy.    this is the only cd that has an 'intermission' that i ACTUALLY LISTEN TO!   thats right, i do not just skip it.  know why?   because it's not a waste of space.   it has a purpose, which is to seperate the 5 more theater-y songs at the end from the 7 not so theater-y songs at the beginning.  i have to admit, i DO skip the introduction occasionally, but thats because it's a preview of the rest of the cd, which i have now listened to a thousand times.     if i had to pick a favorite song, it would probably be track 12 \\"Theres a Good Reason These Tables are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of it Yet\\".    however, the last 5 tracks (minus POSSIBLY 'I Write Sins Not Tragedies' just because they repeat lyrics alot, which isn't all that bad because its still a damn good song)  are all fantastic and you can listen to them over and over again for weeks. <br /> <br />this cd is truly very good and is worth the money.  GET IT!
B00005AQGH|5.0|Just want to say, Tupac is not necessarily showing disrespect towards Jesus. If you know anything at all about when Jesus died, two other ordinary people were crucified next to him, and this was something done quite frequently during that time. Now I can't say for sure what Tupac's intentions were, but I am not offended by this cover and do not believe he was trying to replace Christ or compare himself to Christ at all. I think he was trying to represent a message, something he does with nearly all of his music. He is my favorite rapper of all time, partly because of this. All the critics out there, you can have your opinion, and I've heard most of them. But don't be mad when people simply like an artist. Of course, when someone is mentioned as the best, many people will try to point out why they are not. Bottom line: 2pac was a poet, an artist, and he put his heart into what he did; he had a big heart and great passion; he chose to rap about bigger issues than money, cars, and gettin' some---he tried to make a positive difference
0307276902|2.0|When this book was announced on Oprah's Book Club, I thought, \\"Okay. That's nice.\\"<br /><br />Although I can certainly relate to overcoming some of life's challenges, I couldn't relate to the subject.  So, I chose to not get this book.<br /><br />And, now that James Frey has been caught having represented this book as a factual history of his addiction and related events, rather than a combination of fact and creative prose, I'm glad I hadn't read this book.<br /><br />I'll bet that this book would have sold just as well, had the publisher included a disclaimer, letting readers know that the story has a factual basis, with some creative prose, because strong readers would have placed themselves in the drama, or into the characters.<br /><br />And in so doing, they would have confronted unfinished business in their psyches, and replaced that business with enlightenment.<br /><br />I wonder now what James Frey will do to prove to the world that he is trustworthy.<br /><br />Will he donate 80% of the earnings from this book to clinics?  Will he invest 20% of the earnings into intensive therapy that forces him to be visible to a body of people who won't allow him to lie as easily as he bends his arms?<br /><br />Representing this book as a factual book, rather than a novel, James Frey took away informed choice from readers.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|The reviewer Rene is right, this is a \\"garbage movie.\\"  I think that the startling divide between those that liked this movie and those that didn't is largely due to age.  I think that indeed those in their early 20's and younger like this kind of movie, largely because of the sex and the gross-factor, which does appeal to the adolescent male mind especially in testing how strong a stomach they have.  In fact, in the commercials that had inundated the air ways, the movie was being introduced as a dare to see it, implying you are weak if you can't handle it.  This plays to a juvenile frail sense of masculinity and need to prove their toughness.  Just look at the review below going by the name \\"B. Perdue\\" (AKA \\"blendered fetus\\").  He (and it is obvious he's a guy) claims people are \\"whinin\\" (there's a letter g at the end of \\"whinin\\" genius), yet \\"Blendedered fetus\\" (did the moron mean \\"Blended\\" and just blunder yet again in basic spelling?)bought into the I-dare-you ploy in having to go see it and now thinking after seeing it it was a great movie because of some misguided sense of accomplishment and validation of male toughness.    In fact if you click on \\"Blendered fetus\\" and see the other movie he reviewed and thought so great, you will find \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" as his other \\"great movie.\\"          \\"Pirates of the Caribbean!!!!\\"    What is this guy like 14?    Yet another reviewer identifying himself as \\"A kid's review\\" first starts out by saying: \\"Many 1-star reviewers seem to think there is something wrong with enjoying a film like this.\\"  He goes on to say why it is OK to enjoy scenes of torutre and that one is \\"normal\\" to do so, yet his very last sentence is \\"So the next time you think about putting down a torture film, get a life. Realize it's the truth and is not just there for people's pleasure...\\"  Hmm...  Someone needs to take a logic and rhetoric lesson, for he concluded with the exact opposite of his opening thesis.    At any rate, seeing someone'seye popped out and then sliced off or what a chain saw can due might be gross but honestly it's far more silly a notion in terms of serving any entertaining, interesting role for me (I'm 28 now).  Perhaps once when pimples were still making their debut on my face and thoughts of naked girls prancing about filled my waking hour, along with someone farting oddly being the most hysterical thing on the planet, this movie would have been thought of as a \\"great movie\\" too.  For the laid-less losers of geek-vile, I can see how this movie would be right up their alley.  But for the rest of us with any adult sophistication, this isn't entertainment.  Moreover a lack of appreciating it, far from being a sign of \\"mental weakness\\" (as the boy wonder below sees it), is a testament to more sophisticated, mature appreciation.      This movie wasn't scary or even gross to me but just plain lame and silly.  Calling it \\"garbage\\" is being rather kind actually.      Lastly, I want to address a point that \\"A kid's review\\" and others like him think they've made when he says that \\"Things that happen all over the world like this all the time. That's the point of this movie; to show people this.\\"  Gee, this kid would definitely think that Oliver Stone's take on JFK is an historically accurate portrayal of real events.  Nice try there son, but don't confuse comic gore fantasies transcribed to the movie screen as taken out of the news.  The supposed reason for the film was not to educate you, you gerbil-brain mental midget, but rather the reason was to make lots of money in a short period of time from pimple-faced laid-less geek losers like you by luring them with naked girls that you can only fantasize about and nothing more.  Sorry there Leroy, but that is the truth.  You got taken sucker.  Now go pop your zits and stay in school.  If you ever want to get laid in your life, stay in school and hit the books.  Do it before you end up a loser 30-something that still thinks a fart is the pinnacle of comedy.
B000BKDOCA|3.0|These remixes are really good <br />Some better than others <br />All 11 remixes are exclusive to this cd and can't be found anywhere else <br />Here is a review of each remix: <br /> <br />Toxic (Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix)- Great intro.  I love the beat... <br /> <br />Me Against The Music (Justice Remix)- Never heard a remix like this before.  The chorus sounds like it's been played too many times and sounds as if it's skipping.  The background music is odd too...and what's that at the beginning of the song?  Britney?  Saying what? <br /> <br />Touch Of My Hand (Bill Hamel Remix)- I think this is the first time this song has been remixed.  I like it but the original is much better. <br /> <br />Breathe On Me (Thin White Duke Mix)- Sexual song.  Britney's signature song.  Can be another version of the song - more dancier. <br /> <br />I'm A Slave 4 U (Dave Aud Slave Driver Mix)- The intro is good, you can hear what Britney says more clearly.  The chorus is great for dancing and jumping around to. <br /> <br />And Then We Kiss (Junkie Xl Remix)- Never heard this song before (till now that is), so for all I know this could be the original.  Good song.  Love the bridge that follows up to the chorus. <br /> <br />Everytime (Valentin Remix)- Better remix than the remixes on the single.  <br /> <br />Early Mornin' (Jason Nevins Remix)- Okay remix.  Like the chorus. <br /> <br />Someday (I Will Understand) (Hi Bias Signature Radio Mix)- Like touch of my hand, I like the original much better, and also because I heard the original first. <br /> <br />...BABY One More Time (Davidson Ospina 2005 Mix)- I like the intro and the chorus is addictive. <br /> <br />Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (Hex Hector Club Mix - Edit)- Cheesy intro, and how they take bits and pieces of the song and remix them makes it even more cheesy.  For example, in the song Britney says, \\"I wanna feel the way you feel, c'mon\\", and they remix \\"c'mon\\", so it's like \\"c'mon...c'mon...c'mon...\\"  Other than that minor annoyance, this remix is pretty good. <br /> <br />Overall this cd is pretty good.  However, I strongly suggest you listen to it before purchasing.  I failed to do that, so now I lost something from my life that I can never get back...lol. <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|Oprah was certainly taken in by the story. But one of several people who weren't conned by Frey is John Dolan, a writer for exile.ru, who immediately panned the book as the cliche-laden hackery that it is, and in a later article even showed that the work is outright plagiarism of a far superior book by the late, genuine junkie, Eddie Little - Another Day in Paradise. <br /> <br />
B000BYA5G4|3.0|Director:  Andrew Niccol <br />Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan, Jeanne-Pierre Nshanian, Ian Holm, Sammi Rotibi. <br />Running Time:  122 minutes <br />Rated R for strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality. <br /> <br />Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.  Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detoxication. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law. <br /> <br />\\"War\\" is crowded with crisp, imaginative visuals, which Niccol (\\"Gattaca,\\" \\"Simone\\") mounts with unusual aplomb. Following Yuri through his 20-year journey as he rises from common criminal to respected trafficker, Niccol and his production crew take every occasion to show off some potent visual flair, padded with terrific CG work. One of the more striking moments of the film is sitting with a handcuffed Yuri in the desert, as he watches, through time-lapse photography, the immediate dismantling by the African locals of the cargo plane that he arrived on. \\"War\\" is a customary journey from poverty to criminal opulence, but Niccol's attention to detail perks up the screenplay, and constantly strengthens the ideas that he's frantically (emphasis on frantically) trying to communicate.  The casting of Nicolas Cage also aids Niccol's blueprint for \\"War.\\" Back in dynamic mode after sleepwalking through \\"National Treasure,\\" Cage coolly plays Yuri's rise to prominence, always making sure to underline his professionalism, loyalty, and cancerous doubt whenever he can. Though backed by a fine supporting cast, this is Cage's film, and he lives up to the promise of the role beautifully, skillfully weaving through conflict and opportunity like a used car salesman, but burdened with the soul of a pacifist. It's a complex role, daring the actor to play a greedy scumbag with sympathetic leanings and Cage is one of the few actors around who can pull off that treacherous character structure.  \\"Lord of War\\" may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a filmabout characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star.  An adequate attempt at highlighting one of the most underappreciated and unknown travesties of world government and crime; however, a slowly-paced, underdeveloped tale that could have been much more entertaining and resounding.
0316172324|5.0|Provocative book on the positive power of snap judgments, but it also addresses how they can mislead us. The \\"editorial review\\" here is good so I won't go on and on about the book. I liked a section on how it is more effective to make decisions when you are 60-70% sure, rather than wasting extra time getting to 100%.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Director:  Ron Howard  Cast:  Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Jason Gary-Stanford, Judd Hirsch, Austin Pendelton, Tanya Clarke.  Running Time:  135 minutes  Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence.    Director Ron Howard (\\"Apollo 13\\", \\"Ransom\\") has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is no exception. It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash (played brilliantly by Oscar-winner Russell Crowe), but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the \\"triumph of the human spirit over adversity\\" type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.  When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany), and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly in a fine performance). After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher (played by a creepy Ed Harris), informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using.     It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen, and accepted as fact, is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head.  The rest of the film details Nash's attempts, with the aid of his doctors and the loyal Alicia, to overcome his illness and to return to productive life as a mathematician.  Like a number of Howard's films, this one has been criticized for its alleged sentimentality. This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards. There is some truth in the criticism, but at least \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" sins less grievously in this respect than do some other recent Best Picture winners.  \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" shows us once again that Crowe is not only a powerful performer, but that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles.     It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. No biography; however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasize. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather thana biographical treatise this approach works well enough.  Overall, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is certainly a valid depiction of a great, yet troubled human being and Howard does a fine job painting his life picture on screen; however, it is certainly not one of the greatest films of the decade and may not have even deserved its Best Picture immortality.  A beautiful triumph of the human spirit; nonetheless, and a film to be enjoyed by psychologists and fans of Crowe alike.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|This album starts off so strong that it disappoints me to give only a 3 star rating, but that is what it deserves. <br />1. Painter is vintage Neil that could've fit nicely with any of his old CSN&Y stuff <br />2. No Wonder, the best song off this CD, hands down <br />3. Falling Off ... very nice song (though Neil could you refrain from singing falsetto anymore) <br />4. Far From Home, Great song, horns and blues and great steel guitar, can't go wrong. <br />5. It's A dream, love this song, it's so damn beautiful..sniff sniff <br />(This is where the down fall begins) <br />6. Prairie Wind,  awful annoying song, starts off OK then gets really annoying, the constant repeating of that chorus <br />7. Here for you, At first listen you think \\"Now here is a harvest-sounding song\\" and that you'd be right but Neil sings it so badly that is kinda ruins the song, it's still growing on me though. <br />8. This Old Guitar..reading a lot of the reviews it seems I'm the only person not to love this song, it nice but just too pretentious to me <br />9. He Was The King, worst song of the CD, it's a song I wanted to like but it's just bad. <br />10. When God Made Me, I love this song since that Katrina benefit concert, Almost sounds like he wrote his own funeral song..I guess having that life threatening illness has something to do with it. <br />     Overall an average Neil release, I like the production...sounds wonderfull and I especially like the gospel singers.  But Harvest 3 , this is not (I consider \\"Silver and Gold\\" the 3rd harvest).  If Prairie wind and He was the king were to be replaced by 2 better quality songs then this might be a different sounding review.  This is an Album I wanted to like and for the most part I did, but after the 5th song it loses it's steam and turns it from being a great album to an average one. <br />Sorry Neil.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Director:  Fernando Meirelles <br />Cast:  Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Hubert Kounde, Danny Huston, Daniele Harford, Packson Ngugi, Bill Nighy, Keith Pearson. <br />Running Time:  129 minutes <br />Rated R for language, some violent images and sexual content/nudity. <br /> <br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" seeks to juggle three film styles-the romance, the thriller, and provocative social realism. On all three levels, the film succeeds, especially with the latter.  Much credit should go to director Fernando Meirelles, who has synthesized a virtual textbook of different film techniques. The uses of set-ups, location filming, lenses, film editing, and close-ups were simply dazzling. While the panoramic scenes of the African landscape were breathtaking, there was a starkly contrasting approach to the close-ups in the scenes in the city. The jittery, hand-held camera sequences added to the dramatic tension and underscored the urgency of coming to terms with poverty and disease.  The romantic portion of the film was anchored by the two characters played by Ralph Fiennes (Justin) and Rachel Weisz (Tessa). Their first meeting was dynamically presented as Tessa was a social activist heckling Justin as he was making a political speech. When the hall was cleared, however, it was Justin who was actually comforting Tessa after her outburst. The juxtaposition of the placid, passive Justin versus the fervent, hyper-kinetic Tessa was brilliantly established in that opening scene.  <br /> <br />The strands of thriller and social realism are inextricably tied together in the film. As a whodunit, \\"The Constant Gardener\\" seeks to uncover what actually happened to Justin and Tessa on their African journey. At the same time, the main culprit that emerges is the heavy hand of greed as the pharmaceutical companies exploit helpless victims of tuberculosis for the purpose of testing and marketing an experimental drug. At one point in the film, it is disclosed to Justin that the pharmaceuticalindustry is no different than \\"arms dealers.\\"  Fiennes gives his most humanistic and endearing performance ever, perhaps even topping his Oscar nominated turns in \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"The English Patient.\\" Rachel Weisz is an illuminating revelation, turning in the performance of her career. Her character develops and becomes even more compelling after she dies and we learn her secrets through expertly paced flashbacks. Director Fernando Meirelles takes the amazing style he honed with \\"City of God\\" and adds a heart with \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" a big heart that bleeds a beautiful cinematic poeticism onto the screen. <br /> <br />This film truly rewards it audience as it works on so many levels. Like this year's earlier word-of-mouth and hot-button issue sleeper, \\"Crash,\\" you won't be able to stop talking about it after you view the film. The politics here are engaging and bound to stir up even the most complacent viewer. What's even more amazing is that all of the timely political discourse and subsequent thriller aspects of the film (courtesy of the source material, John Le Carre's novel) are wrapped up in a timeless romance. We, the audience, join Fiennes on his journey, and we rediscover the love story between he and his wife that anchors the film in a poetic realism usually reserved for movies with much less on their minds.  Meirelles again shows us he is a true artist willing to show both the shocking beauty and abject horror of the people and places that populate his films. Again he delivers a message that people are doing horrible things to other people the world over (be it in the form of wishy-washy governments turning a blind eye, greedy corporations putting a price tag on a human life, local thugs preying on the misfortune of their neighbors, or friends betraying friends).  Not a perfect film by any means and not for all, but an impressive effort from a fine director and an appealing drama that has many intelligent, thought-provoking layers.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album inspires people to be more creative themselves, my attempt at a creative title; for example... The white tones of the violin pull at one's emotions, \\"ils tirent le coeur\\" yes this cd is amazing after a break up, but not really if you're feeling like being happy. Musically, it's like nothing i've ever heard before. \\"C'est un album ravissante, qui etend jusqu'a l'ame.\\" The Blower's Daughter was heard in that movie with Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts... oh yeah, Closer. It's a beautiful, melancholy song with beautiful expressive lyrics and instrumentation. \\"I can't take my eyes off of you, and so it is, just like you said it should be...\\" and so on. The way Damien sings the lyrics seems to touch people and reach out to give so much more meaning to all the words. I've had this album for quite a while now, maybe 8 months, \\"et c'est absoluement fantastique!\\"
0062502182|5.0|If I was stranded on a desert island and could only take one book with me, this would be it.  Though I'd feel sort of cheated because it's so short and I'd be done with it in no time at all...<br /><br />It's a fable about following your dreams, yes.  But it's more than that.  It's a story about how to nurture your spirit, how to know the real you, how to take risks and trust that the Universe will provide everything you need at exactly the right time.  Leap and the net will appear, right?<br /><br />This book is amazing.  And for the few hours it will take you to read it, you'll reap inspiration, reawakened passion, belief in yourself and the world.  Not a bad investment.<br /><br />His writing is delicious, the story is exciting, and the parables are clear.  Read it in one sitting on a rainy afternoon.  You won't be sorry.
0783219695|5.0|This movie moved me. I was not around for when this event actually happened, and this movie totally recreated the situation for me. It is the most amazing non fiction movie i have ever seen because of the terrible odds the astronauts are up against creates intense situations and a great, inspirational movie.<br /><br />This movie is a classic must-have for your dvd collection!
B00008OLIO|5.0|I cannot personally think of a more Heavy, Raw sounding recording ever. I love this CD from start to finish.     LIVEWIRE- Kicks this CD off. Fast, Furious, and full of melodic metal guitar. 5/5    COME ON AND DANCE- Great song..not the best on the CD though 4/5    PUBLIC ENEMY #1- COWBELL!! I need more COWBELL! 4/5    MERRY GO ROUND- Tommy's drumming is in top form...love it! 4/5    TAKE ME TO THE TOP- This is the meat and potatoes. Heavy, melodic, quick, and a catchy chorus to boot! 5/5    PIECE OF YOUR ACTION- Right up there with the predecessor. I was hooked on this song as a teen. The Rythym guitar is amazing! 5/5    STARRY EYES- Probably my favorite from this Disc. Just listen..you'll see why 6/5    TOO FAST FOR LOVE- My favorite first line of any song \\"Livin' on a jet makin' love to someone elses dream\\", Wow! Why is that such a catchy line?    ON WITH THE SHOW- Great tune, just a tease of the \\"Home Sweet Home\\" phase down the road..yet still heavy..great story 4/5    Great Crue CD!! You won't waste your money.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|...which is hard to do when your already the best band in the world. People who respond negatively to this CD do not appreciate the genious that Daron is. Either that or they haven't listened to anything but \\"Hypnotize\\" (the song). This is possibly the best album that soad has produced out of their 5 total cds.
B000065AI3|5.0|This is the good stuff. The straight ahead snarling young man brand of rock and roll.The hits you already know (\\"Breakdown\\" and \\"American Girl\\") and that's enough to justify this CD but don't miss the excellent lesser known gems such as \\"Mystery Man\\". The different styles on display here presage his later work but this stuff along with his other early records are imbued with that thrilling virile snarly-ness that us ladies just can't resist.<br /><br />In addition to the excellent music, there is some hilarious album art...TP and the HBs in tight leather pants with heavy metal hairdos and...shotguns? What a scream! Ah, we thought they were sayck-EEEE way back in the day. What were we thinking.<br /><br />Recommended for all fans of the straight-ahead rock genre.
B000024D4R|4.0|While this album is a very good album, it's no Wish You Were Here or Dark Side of the Moon.  It opens and closes with a version of Pigs on the Wing (different start and end version), which are by far the weakest songs on the album. <br /> <br />However, the other songs are all good, and Dogs is simply stunning, all 17 minutes.   An attack on the rich and heartless businessmen, Dogs is one of Pink Floyd's top ten songs.  Pigs (Three Different Ones) follows, and is disappointing only to the extent that it doesn't live up to Dogs.  However, it is good musically, lyrically, and thematically.  Sheep is much of the same story. <br /> <br />This album is very good, even if not Pink Floyd's best.  It is well worth the money, if only for Dogs.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|I completely agree with reviewer Robert from Sydney. This movie is muddled, boring, confusing and preachy. Just another do-gooder against the oh so evil large corporations. The photography alone can give you a giant headache, trying to follow the hazy and sped up hand-cam like action jumping constantly from one place to another.  <br />Plot is completely loony. I like Ralph Fiennes, but what a disappointment. I would have given this much hyped movie a \\"0\\" if I could. Don't even waste your movie rental money on this lemon.
0765309408|5.0|For those of you like me, you remember the first time you read Starship Troopers. You remember the thrill of it. The feeling of an alternate and advanced (if only technologically) world out there that was almost tangible. Everything about it worked, and you ate up every word.  <br /> <br />Also if you're like me you've read alot of so called 'hard SF' since then... military and otherwise. You've run in to a few good ones, even fewer great ones... and sadly you can count on your hand the books with that \\"Starship Troopers\\" feel. <br /> <br />Add \\"Old Man's War\\" to that Starship Troopers list. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have is that it is too short. The characters are all well drawn, the technology seems very feasable. The world itself is EASILY concievable, even if you havn't thought of anythign like it before. I give \\"Old Man's War\\" the same praise I give \\"Starship Troopers,\\" I can only smile idiotically, think \\"wow,\\" and reccomend it to everyone I know. <br /> <br />Great books are too rare to ignore, and if you see how many reviews I've written you can see how often I'm moved enough to spend time writing one. <br /> <br />Buy this book, you will never regret it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I always thought live performance is not as perfect as the studio recording. But this is definitely not true in Buble's case. Not only this DVD provides excellent sound and image, but also most importantly, in my opinion, Buble sings ten times better at this concert than he did in both cds. Don't believe me? check it out for yourself. Of course, make sure you use a good sound system or headphone instead of the crappy tv speaker.
140003180X|1.0|You know how cake icing, whether  stuck on the box of a purchased cake or on the rim of your cake holder at home, when you scrape it off with you finger and put it in your mouth, has that shot of sweetness with no body behind it? That is how this book struck me - a little icing with no cake! I've looked through the other reviews and this is definitely a contrary view. I will never read another of this book series and will look hard at anything else by this author.<br /><br />The series was highly recommended to me by several friends and I have very broad reading interests. But, this is just too much fluff. As Gertrude Stein said about Oakland \\" There is no there, there.\\"
B0002MPU1K|4.0|I think I might be the minority here, I actually like this one better than his first album. Cincotti simply sings much better now. Although his voice still doesn't quit grab me, maybe he should foucus more on his piano solo, he surelly can play piano quite well. And add some spark. For his young age, I would expect more energy.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|I've been into the Arctic Monkeys for a while now due to the UK hype over them;  I sampled songs, downloaded a few things and loved everything I found.  The debut album has been well worth the wait and it does NOT dissappoint in the least.  Very fresh, fun sound- jammy, fuzzy guitarwork and that VOICE!  It sounds like the voice of the UK young-adult collective;  the lyrics speak volumes.  Some will probably be put off by the very thick accents, but the appeal of the lyrics and tunes is undeniable.  This will be in rotation for me for a long time to come!  Standout tracks include the singles \\"Fake Tales of SF\\", \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" and \\"Bet you look Good on the Dancefloor\\"- but the whole thing doesn't let up til the end....this is the stuff of classic CD's and I hope they are around for a long time to come.
B000001G16|5.0|I didn't really know about Richie's solo work until seeing a musician's post on a Bon Jovi message board as to what a masterpiece Stranger in This Town was, and that Richie was the most underrated musician in the world, by the public, but not within the music industry. He was hoping that Richie's new album was just as good as Strangers.  <br /> <br />So I purchased this CD and \\"incredible masterpiece\\" is a very fitting description. I can't believe how great this album is, and the incredible soul and feeling Richie was able to express in his songs.
B00001OH7P|5.0|David's most well-known album, Ziggy Stardust, is is his most popular for good reason. First, it was one of the first concept albums to ever be made, along with The Wall and Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band. Second, it was possibly the first album to tell visions of apocalypse, since there is that theme running through it. And third, it was the first album to reveal the tortured lifestyles most rock stars at the time had. I won't bother explaining the concept of the album, since most people already know it. So, I'll just say this: If you don't own this album, buy it NOW!!!
B0006284JQ|1.0|And to add to the dark family history, her talentless husband is releasing a rap album. Can't wait to bash and ridicule that album and the fact that her career is pretty much a trailer trash Jerry Springer episode is ironic for a chain smoking, alcoholic, bad mother has been.
B000002OX7|5.0|1st of all, f*** Homozon for taking down my perfectly good, inoffensive review with no swearing whatsoever. This is rediculous and un-called for. It bugs me that retarded reviewers like I Love MTV and 85 Dorlean are getting away with their completely false reviews and MY reviews are getting taken down left and right.<br /><br /> Now that I've got that out of the way, this album is f***ing awesome, and belongs in every rock fan's collection. Who's Next has more synth in it, and is more theatrical than any of their other albums. Other than that, it has some of the best songs Pete ever wrote for the band: Won't Get Fooled Again, Behind Blue Eyes, Baba O' Riley, and many more. This was the 1st Who album I ever picked up, and it's still my favorite(and that has NOTHING to do with the fact it was their most successful album). I still remember how surprised I was with John Entwistle's bass playing. I am a bassist myself, and after I heard his playing, he immediately became my other bass idol(the other is Chris Squire from Yes). Oh, and for the record, if I hear that The Who ripped Behind Blue Eyes off Limp Bizkit 1 more time, I'm going to break my skull with my tennis racket. Honest to God, The Who came out with that song in 1971, that was before anyone in Limp Bizkit ever existed(I'm looking at you, 85 Dorlean!)!!!!<br /><br /> Anyway, this is a great addition to any music lover's collection. Another great album from the planet's greatest band ever: The Who.<br /><br /> Thanks a lot, Homozon, for taking down my perfectly good and un-offensive review. You want to give me an un-helpful vote? Fine. But screw you because what I said abou Amazon taking down my review is true. In fact, I'd be surprised if this review even makes it.
B000002KBU|5.0|Theoretically, this review should write itself. It's Blue by Joni Mitchell, one of my favorite albums by one of my favorite lyricists (if not my favorite, period). So I could go avant-garde on you and end the review there. I don't think I will, though.<br />This was Joni's first great album. Yeah, Clouds had potential, but the melodies had a long way to go. Yeah, Ladies of the Canyon had its moments, but it was rather uneven. NOTHING is uneven about Blue. I consider seven of these ten songs absolute classics, and the remaining three are just really, really good.<br />The uptempo, all-acoustic All I Want sets the tone quite nicely, with some of the best lyrics on the album. But the REALLY cool part about that song is that it manages to convey several different emotions without being cluttered or confused. Not many other artists can do that, mind you. Considering the tone on this album is mostly... well, Blue, it's nice to hear that this isn't a totally depressing song.<br />Skip ahead a bit to Carey. Carey has her working closely with a backing band for one of the few times in her early career, and the backup singers really do add a lot. But Joni is the focus here, and her lyrics about a dying relationship are perfect. You wouldn't know it's about an imminent breakup at first, because it's a pretty fast song. Great melody, too.<br />The title song offers the exact opposite. One of the four voice-and-piano songs on the album. This is arguably my favorite song here. The imagery found is powerful, the piano's good, and her delivery is chilling. A very underrated song, if you ask me.<br />California is the only optomistic song on this album. Probably the most famous, too. And it really lives up to the hype, I'll say that right now. That pedal steel is the perfect touch, and the longing lyrics have just the right touch of humor.<br />Skip ahead a bit more to River. My personal favorite Joni Mitchell song. Yes, it's just another breakup song, but it's much more emotional than most breakup songs. And anyway, the lyrics breathe new life into a tired subject. Again the piano playing is of note, sarcastically incorporating Jingle Bells.<br />As far as lyrics go, the next song (A Case of You) is probably the best on the album, with her taking a very original metaphor just as far as it can go before it gets annoying. In other words, it retains its originality without getting old. Again, it's got that touch of self-depricating humor that occasionally crops up in Joni's work (i.e. Twisted). Probably her high point as a lyricist.<br />Still another unfairly forgotten classic is The Last Time I Saw Richard. This song could easily be a hell of a romance novel, I can say that right now. She creates two fairly deep characters in those five minutes, and as usual the atmosphere is appropriately somber. Another little bonus is her extended piano solo at the end of the song.<br />The other songs (This Flight Tonight; Little Green; My Old Man) don't reach that level, but they all have their merits; a great chorus and slyly incorporated electric section on This Flight; allusive lyrics on Little Green; and her singing on My Old Man is good as ever.<br />Blue is simply an essential album..

B00079FUI6|1.0|For Pete's sakes, it's Aaron Spelling all over again.  The portrait of living in suburbia is just ingenious.  All those beatiful faces and bodies living on the same block?  Where does the show take place again? <br /> <br />The show is generic, generic, generic.  Overblown supermarket aisle publication crap.  The messages could not be more recyclable nor superficial.  Some people have compared this show to Sex and the City (which is not precisely a shrine of depth in itself) and it's unfair to do that because it lacks all of that show's acidic wit and insider humor.  This is just a bad soap opera with cheap gags.  To the show's credit though, they did manage to feature some impressive guest stars to appear (e.g. Marlee Matlin).
B00006399Z|4.0|First off, the eleven-minute Dear Mr. Fantasy is great listening, not at all indulgent like the Allmans, Zep, and Cream could get sometimes. And then there's 40,000 Headman, a dark, unforgettable tune and one of Traffic's Best. Also worthy are Medicated Goo and Gimme Some Lovin'. Though there are a couple uninspired monents (Sad & Deep, Shouldn't Have Took etc.), it's a must-hear for Traffic fans, along with the hits.
1932907009|2.0|I should have known it when I saw that the author's big credit was \\"Stop or My Mom Will Shoot\\" - a film that even it's best poster was painful to watch.  If you've been attracted to screenwriting from those films that have made big impressions on you for being unique and as close to true art as film can get, please, please, PLEASE forget about getting this book!  If you'd like to try your hardest to get your name on a box in Blockbuster - *any* box, go right ahead.  This is a how-to guide to writing an incredibly formulaic screenplay.  The kind of movie that makes me wonder why I'm even bothering to spend two hours watching a film.  Every tip is presented in the light of how to get your script sold, no matter what.  You must do this and this to be sold today, you must create the mediocre scripts that are getting produced.  This may be viable advice but it seems more to me to be the perfect guide for a screenwriter who hasn't sold anything in years and his mortgage is bearing down on him.  He's stuck, foreclosure is in 90 days and he must write.  No genie is there, this book is.  It'll get your item sold, you just might want to use another name.  If you are someone who still has a decent day job and is writing to dream, please pickup a copy of Syd Field's \\"Screenplay\\" and try your best to write something great.  99.9% of the aspiring writers will fail in either case but if you manage to be that 0.1%, at least you'll have something that your children will watch with something other than a pained half-laugh on their faces.    If you can pick though this book and find the 5% that is universal good advice, go for it.  The same 5% is in all the other solid screenwriting books and they're not quite so insulting to boot.

2266144340|5.0|For a while I resisted reading this book, thinking that it could not possibly be as good as its hype. Well, I was wrong. This is simply one terrific book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. It is a very well-written, intricately plotted thriller in which a great number of esoteric historical facts and interesting theories of a religious nature are woven. Those who read it should, first and foremost, keep in mind that this book is simply a work of fiction.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose when Jacques Sauniere, the elderly and revered curator of the Louvre, is murdered inside the museum. The crime scene and the body itself are laden with symbols and cryptic messages pointing to renowned Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. He is invited to the crime scene by the wily Captain Bezu Fache, of the Central Directorate Judicial Police, the French equivalent of our Federal Bureau of Investigation, ostensibly to assist the police. Little does Langdon know that he is, in fact, the prime suspect.<br /><br />When he meets police cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, they join forces. They are then led on a merry chase by a series of riddles and ciphers that are ground in a historical context. They are always just one step of the French police, who seem determined to charge Langdon with the murder of Jacques Sauniere. During their voyage of discovery, Langdon and Sophie come across a secret society, the Priory of Sion, that has a startling list of former members, which list includes Leonardo Da Vinci, as well as the late Jacques Sauniere. There is also some interesting historical detail about the ancient Knights Templar, as well as Opus Dei, a conservative religious organization currently in existence.<br /><br />Langdon and Sophie peel back layers of historical clues that point to a secret of such magnitude that some would kill for it. As Langdon and Sophie surreptitiously travel from France to England and seem to be headed closer to the heart of the mystery that they are trying to unravel, an unknown nemesis is closer to them than they would dare imagine. This unknown adversary is marshaling resources in order to obtain the long hidden secret that Langdon and Sophie appear to be on the brink of discovering. It is one that has the potential to have earth shattering implications.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, plot driven, rather than character driven, thriller. It hurls itself into the reader's consciousness at break-neck speed, and before the reader realizes it, the book holds the reader in its thrall: hook, line, and sinker. For those readers who love historical detail and unusual facts and coincidences, this is definitely a fascinating book that will hold their interest. It is a page-turning thriller in which nearly every chapter leaves the reader on the brink of a precipice. The book is written in clear, effortless prose, which makes the most esoteric historical details surprisingly easy to understand. Simple in its presentation but intricate in its plotting, it is no surprise that this book has become a runaway, international bestseller.

0385507755|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one!  I was looking forward to a \\"can't-put-it-down\\" read, as so many had described it, including Oprah, but about four chapters into the book I couldn't bring myself to pick it back up (and this was before I knew about The Smoking Gun article).  It was simply too hard for me to believe that a detoxing alcoholic / drug addict could have such vivid recollection of the gruesome details of his first few days in recovery.  Addicts looking for something helpful to read would be much better off investing in the Big Book of AA or other AA and NA literature.  True recovery involves honesty about one's self and one's history.  This is something James Frey clearly hasn't come to yet!<br /><br />Simply put, labeling this book a 'memoir' is like Michael Moore labeling his movies 'documentaries'.
B000CQYCL0|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award, which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.
B000002H2H|5.0|What's not to like?  Ride the Lighting is an album for the ages, one that can be heard over and over again and each time you will notice something new that you didn't the previous time.  There is no \\"filler\\" on this album but classics like For Whom the Bell Tolls, Ride the Lighting, Call of the Ktulu (instrumental), and Fade to Black are standouts.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book before the media hype regarding Frey's exaggerations were exposed.    Either way, this book provides great insight as to what an addict must overcome to stay clean and it helps one realize that there are others ways besides the AA option.   It is really insightful if you have a loved one with an addiction as it helps you to see that it is beyond your control and not about you.
0679879269|5.0|Let there be no qualms about this - \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is an awe inspiring piece of fantasy literture, encaptulating every aspect that makes a good book for both adults and children; lovable characters, gripping plot and deep undercurrents for the more astute. <br /> <br />Reading through many of the reviews, there seems to be massive discourd over the way Pullman has apparently critisised Christianity. This is not so. Pullman, as far as I can see has no objections to religion (Christianity) but the way it has been institutionalised by the \\"Church\\", and what it/they has done to the base message of Christiainity - subverted it to their own devise. <br /> <br />This is summer up in the last few paragraphs where Pullman says, through Lyra, that the idea of a Kingdom of Heaven (ruled by God, with Eouchs etc) is ultimatly flawed, and that a much better idea would be a republic of heaven, with no Authority to watch over and control. In this, the moral views of Christianity would be upheld. For example, \\"be good to others\\" not because God will punish you if you don't, but because it's the right thing to do. <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway...kind of went off topic there... <br /> <br />Who ever you are, this is a book to read, and you can connect to it at any level you want - either an amazingly beautiful story, or a more thought provoking read on religious (and scientific) views/theories.
B00008DDRX|4.0|Forget the weak, simplistic love story, forget the hokey rivalry plot, this movie is about the hardest race in the world and the myth and magic surrounding it. One day, 24 hours, flat out, man and machine competing to see who breaks first. McQueen loved both acting and making this film and it shows in the little touches, like the carnival and campground surrounding the race and the people who come to see the greatest race on Earth, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.... <br /> <br />Plus, with Dolby Surround running though a home theatre system, the banshee war-cry wail of a Porsche flat 12 engine will raise every hair on your body straight out!
B00005JNRE|4.0|-Nanny McPhee- [delightfully played w/dreadful hag make-up by Emma Thompson] isn't pretty, doesn't sing, & her medicine *isn't* served w/a spoonful of sugar ... but she's a terrific nanny nonetheless.  She's no Mary Poppins but then again, the Brown children aren't the sweet moppets of the Banks family.  For 1 thing, there are *7* of them ... & no mother to rein in their gleeful attempts to drive away every female authority figure.<br /><br />When the local agency refuses to help him after his 17th nanny quits, Mr. Burns [Colin Firth, charming & befuddled in a quiky role *far* from Mr. Darcy, but hinting at What Might Have Been had Darcy been poor] is told that who he needs Nanny McPhee.  From there it's a quick hop, skip & danc[ing donkey] to the entrance of the stout nanny w/2 HUGE moles, 1 oversized incisor, & the unsettling abiliy to ... just appear when needed.  Or not; she's just *there* when she evidently feels needed.  Only the scullery maid Evangeline [the winsome Kelly Macdonald in a fascinating turn as the pretty but *quite* unsuitable maid, who can't even read] understands that it's grief, not mean spirits, that has led the Burns children to misbehave.<br /><br />When Simon [a complex role nicely fulfilled by Thomas Sangster] leads the others in a futile atempt to drive Nanny McPhee away -- an attempt, in fact, which boomerangs beautfully -- the lesson is well-learned.  & despite the dark fears of the 2nd-oldest son Sebastian [Sam Honywood aptly playing the 'mad scientist' child] that 'All Stepmothers are Evil', Nanny McPhee teaches the kids that fear -- not nannies -- is the real enemy.<br /><br />All in all, a sweetly confectionary fantasy which teaches w/o being dull ... the kids *&* the audience!

I do regret that it will be exactly the extended version that came on tv with the patchy edits, the recycled cut scenes and the scenes removed as mentioned in earlier posts; Baron pulling the heart plug out of that slave-boy, Baron spitting in Jessica's eye and the Mentat Piter DeVries wiping it with his finger, etc- squirmish stuff for some admittedly but visually enforced the idea of the depravity of the Harkonen. Hey dont forget, we also get that prologue that illustrates the time preceeding the Butlerian Jihad and the formation of the Mental Training schools, very exciting that was!    The added details included with the extended version filled in certain voids, added flesh to the bones so to speak to certain areas. The invocation of the Amtal rule and the preceedeing duel between Paul Atriedes and \\"whassisname\\" and the process and ritual of claiming the body's water (was his name 'Jamis'??..stumped right now), the 'Little makers' and the drowning process that leads to the harvesting of the \\"bile of a newborn worm\\" then distilled as the 'water of life'. Boy I was mesmerized when I saw it all for the first time.    I was 14 years old when Dune originally came out, and it blew me away. It was so other worldly and \\"fantastic\\" and although I initially had the gripe that it didnt faithfully follow the book, \\"back in the day\\" no movie adaptation ever did. The ending never quite let me sit well, with it raining and all but I have to admit like many of you guys out there, we were avid readers of the entire series and know that it was the rain (ecological change)that began destroying the worms, but only those who read the books will have had thought on this. (it's also only those that read the books that have kept Dune alive and out of obscurity these past 20 years or so).    As time has marched on and movie making technology has advanced and good movies have been produced, Dune has never ever left my top spot. Perhaps because I saw it at an age where it impressed itself upon me more than I realize, or that it is one of the purest fantasy science fiction I have ever put my eyes on... who knows. One thing I know is, flaws and all I will be happy to get this DVD. The Sci-fi channels Dune Chronicles adhere to the books more acurately but there is something about this original...who else cant see Gurney Haleck portrayed by anyone but Patrick Stewart? \\"They shall come all for violence, their faces shall sup up like the east wind, as they will gather the captivity of the sand\\"!!...
B00003CWPL|5.0|It's been a while since I've had a chance to sit down a watch this film. If you find you have no sense of humor watching the strange and unusual-\\"Don't watch this\\". I love Lynch!! <br />I love all the strange and unusual characters-theme-plot-subtext-begining-middle and end.

B000AP04FG|3.0|Angelina & Brad -<br /><br />the prettiest stars in Hollywood... too bad this movie put me to sleep.<br /><br />Somewhat predictable. Somewhat far-fetched. Pretty Brad and pretty Angelina get married, have a pretty house, pretty clothes, pretty normal boring life.. but, something amiss... ahh, they are both assassins, but failed to tell each other (yes, that happened with me and my husband, don't you just hate that!)<br /><br />They find out, accidentally, when their professional paths cross, then it gets boring. I liked it up until they \\"found out.\\"<br /><br />Happy ending, bal bla bla.. I didn't stay up. Did they kiss and make up? Or, did they kill each other? hummm, I can't tell you!!<br /><br />OK, watch this DVD for the fun of it,  and to see the pretty actors, but, not if you are looking for anything deep.

0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki is brilliant.  The content in this book is a must read for everyone.  Even the billionaires out there.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad changed my perspective on life...forever.  I grew up thinking that owning a business some day would be the best thing ever.  Thanks to the Cash Flow Quadrant illustration in this book, I now know the difference between owning a business that owns me AND owning a business system that provides income, builds daily, without me having to be present every day!  This book has given me the tools that created an income stream beyond my dreams.  All because I read this book, seeked mentors that implemented Kiyosaki's teachings, and opened my eyes beyond what I thought I knew.  I have moved from the E quadrant to the I quadrant.<br /><br />Thanks Robert!  I have recommended this book to tons of people who have also made positive changes in their life.<br /><br />Gratefully,<br /><br />Rob Lohman author of The Momentum Journey : Breakdown at Exit 63
0385507755|4.0|I waited until finish the book to read the expose on thesmokinggun.com, and to see oprah, and to listen to the gossip. At the start of the book, ever so graphic , on the plane, a hole in his cheer and bleeding, I began to wonder how he could remember this is his 'state' was so altered and injured. I wondered this again during the dental surgery.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book but I did know he attended the snot bag Hazelden rehab for frat-boys-turned-drunks. I also know that 99% of rehabs have \\"checks\\" every 15 min, in which each patient must be accounted for since they are liable. Knowing this; I wonder how James could take off with Lilly for such seemingly long amounts of time. I also wondered about the open campus rule.<br /><br />Over all the book was a quick read and I was definately riveted. Upon seeing him read passages on Oprah under the ruse it was real, it kinda turned me off. A book wrapped in scandle with many good point but you must use a questioning eye.

Some melodic songs, some heavy songs they have it all to be the greatest mainstream metal band <br /> <br />Bottom line  <br /> overal score 85/100 <br /> <br />Pick up this cd if you love all kind of rock or if you are a true fan since their first cd like me <br />

B000002BMV|5.0|I just picked this LP up for 50 cents from my local thrift.  The other copy I have is all beat up from use and I've never owned it on CD. <br /> <br />I forgot how much these songs mean to me.  This album came out when I was thirteen and it carried me for the next five years, all through high school.  Songs of loneliness, hope, angst and passion fill these songs, the intensity of which only occurs during youth.   <br /> <br />There is a sound that just radiates of driving late at night, alone, longing for something or someone to fill the ache.  I can't tell you how many times this album gave me hope and expressed what I could not put into words. <br /> <br />There are a few rockers on here (\\"Stone In Love\\", \\"Keep on Runnin'\\"), a few dreamy songs (\\"Don't Stop Believing\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\") and the epitome of ballads, \\"Open Arms.\\"  Every song in here is a song you can sing to alone.  If you play it for a group, don't be surprised if everyone knows the songs and sings along. <br /> <br />Side 1 is perhaps one of the best album sides ever.  The whole album is just classic, Journey at its peak. <br /> <br />Say what you wish about the 80s sound, the formula riffs and all the other criticisms, this album means a lot to a whole bunch of people.  It may never go down in history as a \\"classic\\" LP but there is no doubt that it is one that will stir up memories of anyone who ever owned it.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|Korn takes on a new direction, departing from their raw brand of metal to explore the more heavily produced sound. I never have a problem with a well established band branching out into a new style, but this effort is substandard for a band that I've come to expect great things from. <br /> <br />The beats are too straightforward, the songs are hard to distinguish, the choruses are repetitive, and it sounds like they stifled the band's most important & creative instrument, Jonathan's voice. He's been reduced to a piece of the band rather than the star that flies above, and interacts with, the dark & passionate instrumental melodies & harmonies we heard on past albums. <br /> <br />I have come to expect great music from Korn over the years, and this album simply isn't great music. I will make darned sure to preview any future Korn albums before hitting the \\"purchase\\" button in the future.
0307276902|1.0|Having read Another Day in Paradise by Eddie Little, it became very obvious to me that James is living vicariously through Eddie's book. You must read Eddie's book and then you will see how clearly AMLP parallels the Little book. From the same basic characters to their almost identical pasts, I found myself becoming angered at this blatant rip-off.  Lilly IS Rosie, right down to the description of the gang rape scenes in both books. As a result, I just do not believe anything in James book actually happened, other than the fact that he spent time in a rehab facility. It was all a fantasy based in large part on Eddie Little's book.    Another tip-off - on Oprah's site there is an interview with James and someone asked him the significance of the scribbles at the start of each chapter.  James stated that he had wanted to start each chapter with a full page of pure black, but it would have been cost-prohibitive.  Hmmmmm, Another Day in Paradise starts each chapter with a page printed half in black.  Coincidence, no?    This is just so wrong.
B0007OCG56|2.0|Despite Adam Sandler's top billing, the stars of the movie are Vega and Leoni with strong support from Leachman and the 2 daughters. The couple's son is almost invisible while the 2 daughters are heavily featured.   Leoni plays a very high maintenance wife to Sandler's reserved husband. They decide to hire a Mexican nanny/housekeeper who doesn't speak any English (Vega). Sandler and Leoni and their family speak zero Spanish. This is real sore point- if you live in a city where millions of people speak English and Spanish and your job requires that you deal with the public, you will have   at least acquired some basic words of the other language. Not these people- not even amigo, adios, vamos, si from the American couple or goodbye, hello, yes from the Mexican housekeeper.  Despite Sandler's presence, there is virtually no humor in the movie. So in that respect, it's just like an Adam Sandler comedy.  The focus of the filmis a brief period of a few months in these character's lives then it fast forwards a number of years to the point where one of the girls is off to college. Vega's daughter is writing a letter to Princeton University explaining why her mother is so special but what she apparently writes is a 2 hour letter on a 3 month period and nothing on any of the years that follow. So much for realism.   If you want to see a movie where all the female characters are strongly defined while the male characters are just window dressing, this is one you'll like.
B0002VL6ZA|5.0|\\"Hotel California\\" the song is so great, it could pretty much carry the album, but it doesn't need to. While I also enjoy the other songs, \\"Hotel California\\" is so good that it causes everything else on this album to be eclipsed, even though much of the rest of the music is very good. The Eagles created a series of very good songs, but when they recorded and released \\"Hotel California,\\" I think every listener realized that it was destined to be a great song from the beginning. Surrealistic, clearly southern California desert influenced, a song that becomes great because it is musical art accessible to nearly everyone.<br /><br />While \\"Hotel California\\" is a great song, several other songs on this CD are excellent. \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" and \\"Victim of Love\\" show some of the influence that Joe Walsh had on the previously country-flavored Eagles, as does the guitar heavy ending of \\"Hotel California.\\"<br /><br />Several songs fall into the ballad category, such as \\"New Kid in Town,\\" Wasted Time \\"and\\" Try and Love Again Then there are the other songs, including \\"The Last Resort,\\" which is a preachy song, but also a pretty song about the environment.<br /><br />The problem for The Eagles was that one song pretty much defined this album, and the group. Try listening to this album without \\"Hotel California,\\" and you will find some decent, well-played songs. Many of the lyrics are very inspired, and this would have been a hit-making album. Add back \\"Hotel California,\\" and you have an album that becomes a musical icon for a group and a generation. I love this song (like nearly everyone else that likes the Eagles), but this album is more than one song. As an album, it is one of my favorite Eagle albums. However, come for the Hotel, stay for the other courses...<br /><br />This particular version is imported from Japan.  While the Japanese are known for their expertise in re-mastering music, I do not believe they have substantially improved on the quality of the original.  At least, I am unable to tell much of a difference.  However, my stereo is not of audiophile quality.  My recommendation is to review the breadth of offerings available for this CD and choose the version that fits your budget and need for quality.inal.

B000003CMB|5.0|This is one legendary CD. Just 7 songs on the original double album and the length of the songs alone was revolutionary. What they did with the extended time to play was remarkable. This is the original lineup in absolute top form. Gregg's singing and organ playing, Berry's bass, the 2 drummers interplay and Dickey's guitar work all shine but the real star of this is Duane. You'll never hear better guitar playing from anyone. Dunae has solos all over the album and what he does with them can not be duplicated 35 years later. A collection of rock music, great guitar work, or live in concert performances would be never be complete without this one.
1400031087|4.0|'A Million Little Pieces' is a great piece of work, and I don't care what Oprah has to say about it. I didn't read it because of her Book Club and I'm not going to criticize James Frey just because the all-mighty talk show host feels the need to redeem herself for her own mistakes.<br /><br />She chose to put the book on her list, she chose to milk it for all it was worth. She should have done her research.<br /><br />James Frey made a mistake by not being completely honest. He is not infallible, and neither is Oprah, or anyone else for that matter.<br /><br />I don't care about his root canal, or his time spent in jail. What I took away from reading 'A Million Little Pieces' was that this is a man who struggled through addiction and alcoholism and has been sober for quite some time. That is what matters. He took control of his life and changed it for the better.<br /><br />'A Million Little Pieces' is his interpretation of his own experiences. We all remember things differently than they actually happened. That is the power of the human mind. Perhaps he should have been more careful. But that doesn't mean Oprah has to have him on national television ripping him apart and inviting others to do it along with her.<br /><br />Oprah wants to declare Frey a symbol of what is wrong with this nation today, a nation that will accept 'truthiness' without hesitation? I suggest she look towards the bigger cowardly culprits running our country, telling lies everyday that have more serious and severe consequences than this man's memoir.<br /><br />Why not invite Bush and Cheney and Rice and Rumsfield on your show, Oprah? And talk about truth and honesty and redemption? Maybe then I would gain back the respect I have lost for you.
B000021XS0|5.0|Words fail me on this album. Have you ever heard an album that simply gave you shivers from the rush of energy and creativity that was put into it? Listen to Dark Side of the Moon, Tommy, American Idiot, Bohemian Rhapsody, or any other great rock opera and trust me...this album belongs with the best of them. Metropolist Part two is one of those albums that can be heard over and over and over and over again. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, it's such a great experience.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Back in 1986, this was the fastest thing to ever come out on record. From the beginning of \\"Angel of Death\\" to the very end of \\"Raining Blood\\", the music seldom slows down. No clean or acoustic guitars are heard anywhere on this record, either. What's so amazing about this album is that it only reached #94 on the billboard charts, which explains that not all the best records sit up at the top of the numbers. I say most of them don't. But that's not the issue here. I don't think there has been anything unsaid about this album, because it is and forever will be a landmark and influential album - not just in thrash/speed metal, but all kinds of metal and other genres as well. The amount of bands that cite Slayer as an influence are countless. Hell, even Tori Amos covered \\"Raining Blood\\", so it's clear that Slayer has made a major impact on music as a whole. Now onto the album...there is nothing that qualifies as \\"filler\\" here, probably because it clocks in at about 29 minutes. Not to worry, however, the brutal force and speed more than make up for the albums brief length. Everything sounds good too. I liked the reverberated sound of the first two records, but this defined Slayer's sound for the better, as they ditched the reverb in a big way. Another amazing thing about this album is that it still stands strong, even today. While even some of the best metal albums of yesteryear tend to sound like yesteryear, you can listen to this record in 2006 and it still sounds just as heavy and brutal as a lot of the modern metal out there right now, if not more. I don't know what else to say except: if you don't own this album already, it is an absolute must, regardless of what sub-genre of metal you prefer. It's musical and lyrical impacts are priceless. Hopefully the upcoming Slayer record will take a direction similar to this one. Five full stars, no question about it.
0778321606|4.0|I enjoyed all four characters in this book, although I struggled with their \\"poor me\\" tendencies at one point or another.  The good news was that they all got over it. <br /> <br />I always enjoy this author and know her stories will be a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.
0307276902|1.0|I'm sorry I didn't say it first since another reviewer beat me to it.  But I couldn't agree more.  OPRAH IS A HYPOCRITE.  Frey and Oprah deserve each other.  Why Frey agreed to another interview with Oprah is beyond me.  He already made his money selling those lies so what did he have to gain---UNLESS (God I wish Amazon would let me underscore this) UNLESS Oprah PAID FREY to be on the show as PAYBACK just so she could whoop him and save face from the Larry King fallout.  Folks, it's all about ratings.  Oprah is a business.  She's an industry.  She can't stand to see her stock fall.  And she's no longer credible.  She and Frey have that in common.  As I say, they deserve each other.  I wish I had the option of giving \\"pieces\\" no stars.
0679441018|5.0|I found this novel highly entertaining and thought-provoking.  I was drawn into Lestat's adventures right from the start, probably because I am a big fan of the Vampire Chronicles.   The prose is rich, seductive.    That Lestat sank his fangs into Jesus' neck at one point in the story was admittedly shocking, but I didn't find it sacrilegious.  (I am a born-again Christian and ex-Catholic.) Jesus himself instituted the Communion at the Last Supper where Christians eat bread (or wafers or crackers) and drink wine (or grape juice), symbolizing his broken body and poured out blood.  So Lestat helped himself to the Holy Blood kind of early, so what?  Rice was not making light of this act at all.  It was handled as respectfully as possible, given the circumstances, and the act flowed well with the story.     What I did find disturbing was the sympathetic light in which Memnoch the devil was portrayed.  The devil abhorred the suffering that humans had to endure and kept questioning God's methods.  But when I thought about it, it makes sense that this is how the devil would operate in our world.  (Not that I am saying Rice's treatment is the end-all and be-all.  It is just her take on the devil.)  The devil would \\"side\\" with us and tell us, \\"Hey, this is painful.  You don't need to go through this event (or condition, sickness, death of a loved one, disability, loss of job, or whatever).  Why does God allow this to happen to you? Isn't there a better way?\\"  He'd make you question God all right.    Thus I found this devil more realistic than some other portrayals in the media.  Given the typical devil in most films and books--a being so evil and violent, one who usually does bad things to the protagonists and easily kills off minor characters--who in their right mind would want to be friends with him anyways, except the die-hard Satanists and homicidal maniacs?  I believe the devil is persuasive and has SOME truth to his arguments (note: SOME truth, not the complete pictureof things).     Now I've read all of Rice's Vampire novels up to this installment.  (I even trudged through the Vampire Armand but stopped there and didn't continue with Blood Canticle, et al, for personal reasons.)  Memnoch the Devil is one of the best.  But I am someone who preferred the Vampire Lestat over the Interview with the Vampire.  It's escapism, it's fantasy, but done so well.

0517123207|5.0|The Origin of Species, for the first time offering an adequate explanation for biological change and origins, should be required reading for anyone interested in biology, history, or life in general.  Because the book outlines the beginnings of a vast, new theory, it is accessible to laypersons.  It does not suffer from the esotericism of most scientific writings, which expect readers to have a working knowledge of a specific scientific idea.  Darwin starts from scratch and builds up all the evidence for his theory in a way that renders his argument undeniable.<br /><br />Darwin's idea explains the production of differing species through natural selection.  Darwin did little to explain evolution, or the change, of species, but this book fully outlines how the mechanism of selection would make sure such random changes would produce complex organisms.  The mechanism Darwin proposes is at once so simple and seems so obvious with hindsight.  It is something evident to any dog breeder--that traits can be selected and passed on to different generations--and Darwin even draws upon knowledge of artificial selection in birds and dogs to bolster his claims.  Ultimately, however, the evidence for evolution by natural selection lies not in a vague analogy to artificial selection, but in the predictions Darwin's theory made and fulfilled.  Darwin's expectation of biological similarity in ancestors and descendants is fulfilled by simply looking at exterior features or even bone structures.  He also notes that his theory thoroughly predicts and explains the existence of rudimentary features like teeth in whale embryos and flightless wings in birds.  The fact that island species correspond most with similar species on the nearest continent, instead of in distant lands, shows that these species are descended from them and changed after migrating to a separate environment.  Darwin also showed how his theory explained the difficulties with classifying species, because evolution thoroughly broke down the distinction of species as pure and distinct.<br /><br />Not only is this book useful in gaining an understanding of evolution, but it is also a good outline for scientific methodology and research.  One comes into reading the book wondering how one could prove an unobservable process that takes millions of years to occur, and is overwhelmed by the ingenuity of the predictions offered by the theory that are fulfilled by subsequent observations.  Darwin's book shows that the predictive power of theories are vital, allowing them to be tested and refuted.  The entire book outlines the vacuousness of the design inference as a common explanation for life, showing that an inference of design does not explain similarity in biological structures, vestigial and rudimentary parts, the geological distribution of life, and the difficulty in classifying species.  All of these observations are explored in meticulous detail by Darwin, and shown to be thoroughly explained by evolution combined with natural selection.<br /><br />From a historical perspective, reading the book causes one to marvel at Darwin's ingenuity.  One can see glimmers of later discoveries reflected in Darwin's reasoning.  One shakes one's head at his ability to explain the distribution of life by glaciers and flight and rafting...only to realize that the theory of plate tectonics would have been a delightful solution to the several problems Darwin noted with distribution for fossilized species.  Darwin often makes bold predictions that the modern reader knows come true, and it is simply a wonderful thing to behold such accuracy.<br /><br />The Origin of Species is a wonderful book, accessible to all, and a treasure to read for anyone with a passion for history, science, or life.oughly broke down the distinction of species as pure and distinct. <br /> <br />Not only is this book useful in gaining an understanding of evolution, but it is also a good outline for scientific methodology and research.

0385507755|1.0|Who cares that its all a lie? I'm a recovering addict. A REAL addict, not a spoiled privileged midwest frat boy with a penchant for lying. <br /> <br />I've been to four funerals in the last 12 months. One of them was a guy who dropped out of AA/NA after reading Frey's crap - before it had been exposed as a fraud. <br /> <br />He decided to follow Frey's advice - beliving that Frey was \\"one of us\\" - a hardcore addict who had beat addiction without NA. <br /> <br />He lasted about three months boefre he got high again. He was dead 2 months after that. <br /> <br />Maybe it's \\"who cares\\" to non-addicts, but to us, to see someone claim to be one of us and to advise people to \\"just hang on\\" and \\"you don't need the program\\", then to find out his is full of it & is actually a spoiled little pampered pseudo-addict who has NO BUSINESS advising any real addict...... <br /> <br />Frey has killed a lot of people with his lies. He should be sued for wrongful death and consumer fraud.  No, - he should hang.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|This album proves that in general people are easier to please rather than challenge, and although that has always been obvious, I liked being challenged by Madonna. <br />For the first time ever I find her sounding average, and maybe that is the biggest shock of all! <br /> <br />Alot of these tracks could have been on a Kylie Minogue album, and the worst moment is the plodding track \\"Isaac\\" not because of the ethnic vocal, but because the guy mainly sings Im Nin Alu over and over again, which was already a hit by Ofra Haza. Why not just sample that? Stuart Price can count himself lucky that his cheesy plastic derivative Pop tracks are saved by the sound of Madonna's vocal. Whether people think Madonna is a great singer or not is beside the point. She has a very smooth and pleasing voice, and when one thinks about how many classic hits she has written herself in the last 20 years, I find it rather sad that the songs here are so bland. \\"Hung Up\\" is fun, but seems a bit rushed and desperate somehow. <br /> <br />On the other hand, exactly this immediancy is what's lacking in the other songs. <br />\\"Get Together\\" would be my favourite for a single , but again lyrically it's got nothing to offer that she hasn't already written before. Finally, I wonder has any artist ever written two songs with the same title in their career? Forbidden Love was already a songtitle on \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Perhaps she'll win an award for being the first artist with the same title for different songs on albums 10 years apart. <br /> <br />The whole dance mess gets at least 2 stars anyway since I still would rather a new album from Madonna than almost any other new dance artist even if it's a bit weak. <br /> <br />Besides she hasn't really confessed anything here except she loves New York. <br />Pretty deep, huh? <br /> <br />\\"Hollywood\\" was better. It's not like she ever completely left the dance market.  <br />Come on you people, be honest about the quality of this album. Her best? <br />I'm going to tell you a secret. You can just F off.
B00064WSNM|5.0|In 1974, King Crimson released the followup to 1973's Larks Tounges In Aspic, Starless and Bible Black. I am surprised this album is not considered among Crimsons best, as only three other albums come close to it in the Crimson catolouge. All of the members of this lineup are virtuoso's at their instruments, and the instrumental interplay between the group is amazing. Robert Fripp is in a league of his own. His guitar playing is absolutely stunning, and this is probably the Crimson album that best shows off his abilities. Bill Bruford is also amazing, his style of drumming is very original and really is the only thing that keeps this album from being complete and total chaos. David Cross and John Wetton, are also great at their instruments, in fact John Wetton was the best Bassist to ever play in Crimson.<br /><br />The opening number \\"The Great Deciever\\" is a classic rocker that features some great violin playing. \\"Lament\\" starts out as a ballad but eventually rocks even harder than the song before. From this point on all the songs were recorded live, and for the most part are instrumental. \\"We'll Let You Know\\" is a great improv piece, with great playing from the entire band. The next two songs \\"The Night Watch\\" and \\"Trio\\" are extremely beautiful, with David Cross contributing great violin. The next three songs, are some of the darkest improv pieces ever laid to tape. \\"The Mincer\\" sends chills down your spine, the title track is extremely unsettling, and then there is one of King Crimson best songs \\"Fracture\\", there is probably no greater an example of Fripps mastering of the guitar than this eleven minute instrumental, there are places where it sounds like there are perhaps three guitarists playing at once, and you have to remind yourself it is just Fripp.<br /><br />I hold \\"Starless And Bible Black\\" in extremely high regard. It is however not the best place to start your Crimson collection, get \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\" and \\"Red\\" first, but Starless proves that many of the more inaccesable albums tend to also be more rewarding.f the more inaccesable albums tend to also be more rewarding.
B0007MUR2W|5.0|This is probably David Bowie's best known album.  It's a concept album about an alien who becomes a rock star.  Truly a classic, possibly the ultimate glam rock album.  Try to get the Rykodisc version, it has five bonus tracks.  The biggest revelation among the bonus tracks is \\"Sweet Head\\", a previously unreleased song from the Ziggy recording sessions that is every bit as good as the songs that actually made it onto the album.
B00005NP04|5.0|This is one of the best CD I have ever listened to!  Martina has a wonderful strong and pure voice that is easy to listen to.  If you don't like this CD I would be very surprised.  The best songs on here in my opinion, are: \\"My Baby Loves Me\\", \\"Life #9\\", \\"Wild Angels\\", \\"Happy Girl\\", \\"Whatever You Say\\", and \\"When God Fearin' Women Get The Blues\\".  These are my favorites but I really like all of the songs on this album.   <br /> <br />Here is my rating of each of the songs: <br /> <br />1). My Baby Loves Me - 5 stars!  One of the best on here! <br />2). Life #9 - 6 stars!!!  MY ABSOLUTE MOST FAVORITE SONG!!! <br />3). Independence Day - 5 stars  Very powerful song. <br />4).

B000BYA5GO|5.0|Yuri Orloff witnesses a Russian mob hit in a restaurant, and suffers a psychotic break. Focusing on the spent shellcasings, Yuri concludes the profit margin on weapons far exceeds the restaurant business, and you can get shot either way. Thus begins his climb to international arms dealer. <br /> <br />Cage's performance is sublime as the amoral but intensely likable Yuri Orloff.  <br /> <br />The \\"Making of\\" movie on the second disk was a sobering counterpoint to the film itself. Among the points made; it was cheaper to purchase live arms for the movie than to make mockups, and the Russian tanks used in one scene were due to be shipped to Lybia. <br /> <br />My husband and I have wiewed the movie 5 times now, and it peels like an onion. We enjoy the characters more each time, and all are very well performed.
B00004W52U|5.0|this is an awesome cd! amazing. it makes me a little depressed that i wasnt born until after this band broke up. the lyrics are fast and hard. yeah...so overall i guess all i can say is if you dont own this cd you are crazy. i dont care what kind of music you listen to. you should still buy this RIGHT NOW.  <br /> <br />and if you like them(which im pretty sure you will) i would suggest rancid. they aren't as good but two of OPIV's members are in it so its similiar. <br /> <br />stop reading this and buy it. pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!!!
0553382179|1.0|I bought this book after quickly breezing though it in the bookstore.  Quite honestly, I found it to have limited usefulness and to be targeted to a very specific audience (Christian, Married stay-at-home moms) For me, there's too much God in the book (and I'm by no means an aethiest)and a few of the suggestions seemed downright absurd and unfathomable to me (put on a pair of shoes everyday???? apparently that's a stuggle for a lot of these women as the testimonies attest to) As a single working person, who wears shoes everyday, this was mind-boggling to me. I have a busy life, which is what leads to the chaos in my home, but this book in no way imagines a woman would have any interests other than taking care of her man and kids, which is fine if that's your choice, but it in no way even allows that people might have a life other than this. It's also very gimmicky which I found rather silly.  Additionally, there are far too many testimonials included in the book--more appropriate for a website touting someone's business.  I find Ronni Eisenberg's book on organization much more insightful and to the point.  Very limited usefulness.
1551113376|4.0|This edition of the Origin is a rare item: a book for the classroom that actually does the job.  It contains a bibliography, explanatory notes, a chronology of Darwin's life, and a register of names. The appendices contain selections from Darwin's other works and selections from Darwin's sources and contemporaries. All for $9.95!  <br /> <br />In addition to these nuts and bolts, the editor has composed an Introduction to initiate students into the sublimity of Darwin's World.  Here's how it begins: `(The Origin) is one of the two or three most significant scientific works of all time-one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world.'  Interested?  Here's more: this surpassing achievement `requires no specialized scientific training'-great news for students mortified by maths.  And more: Origin is `also a great literary classic' that is `eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling'.  Holy Darwin!  How good can it get?  Even English lit students might go for that. <br /> <br />Surprise: editor Joseph Carroll is an English lit prof.  His speciality is the evolutionary analysis of literature, an innovation that he pioneered.  Lit departments aren't science-friendly territory.  Often they run an anti-science line, linking it to exploitation, global warming, racism, misogyny and the like.  Come to think of it, isn't Darwinism among the worst offenders?!  Survival of the fittest, let the weak perish and the rich get richer, eugenic breeding to clean out the bungled and botched, that kind of thing.  To block such negative thoughts, Carroll preaches an oration of superlatives about the Great Man that exceeds anything I've encountered.   In scientific achievement, personal character, wisdom, and influence, Lord Darwin in his shining eminence leaves all others in the shadows.  Here is Carroll on Darwin's most important contribution to culture: `The vision of nature Darwin offers is not that of some broad, abstract, intellective pattern, but that of living impulse, eager, frantic, animating every single organism, vast and minute, in inconceivable numbers, everywhere on earth, persisting throughout all time of organic life'.  It is a vision of `competitive struggle', of the `great battle of life', and the `war of nature'.  Interestingly, in this context Carroll notes that Darwin specifies an empirical finding that would `annihilate my theory'--a species that developed `an adaptation solely for the benefit of some other species'.  That's because, Darwin believed, as Victorians typically believed, that every organism looks out for Number 1.  It's called `individualism'. <br /> <br />What about that?  Is there any species with adaptations that benefit only another species?  Sorry to say this, but yes, there are.  The pattern is called `inquilinism', which lies at the extreme end of the spectrum of parasitism.  See E. O. Wilson, Sociobiology, p 371.  Note: Darwin says unequivocally that his theory is `annihilated', yet for some reason the ardent Darwinian Wilson doesn't draw that conclusion.   <br /> <br />An English prof isn't expected to know about inquilinism, but literary visions of nature are another matter.  Poets and novelists homed in on the implications of godlessness of the mechanistic universe well before the Origin was published.  Among those usually mentioned is Alfred Tennyson's In Memorium (1850), whose famous lines `Who trusted God was love indeed / And love Creation's final law -- / Tho' Nature, red in tooth and claw / With ravine, shriek'd against his creed' convey the temper of his sombre, lengthy meditation on nature.  `Nature red in tooth and claw' became a byword among Victorians for the world they had come to inhabit.  We might expect Carroll to seize on this fact, to stress how Darwin's vision fitted into the new cognitive-symbolic structures created by poets.  But not a word of that!  Carroll disregards not only Tennyson, but all imaginative writing that formed thecontext of Darwin's publications.  Why this silent denigration of the importance of his own field? <br /> <br />Probably because even summary recognition of the literary dimension of Victorian culture would expose the historical inaccuracy of Carroll's extravagant claims for Darwin's originality.  For example, he attributes massive innovative force to Darwin's replacement of creationism by purely naturalistic explanation in natural history.  In fact, this was no innovation at all; the physical and hard biological sciences had long since oriented on exclusively natural causes.  The only `scientists' still clinging to creative intervention in nature were naturalists-those amateur bird watchers and rock collectors who often enough were clergymen.  Since Darwin identified himself with naturalists, it was `natural' for him to challenge creationism.  But this challenge had been forcefully launched in 1844 in the anonymously published best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.  The author, Robert Chambers, wrote a defence of no-exception naturalism far more frontal, eloquent, and incisive than anything from Darwin's pen (Darwin was loath to give offence, especially to his pious wife Emma).   <br /> <br />Not only had the sciences eliminated divine causality, so had theology!  In 1846 the entirely secularist The Life of Jesus Critically Examined was translated from German into English by the novelist George Eliot (aka Marian Evans).  Eliot enjoyed a close friendship with Herbert Spencer; together they edited the Westminster Review.  They  were part of an intellectual circle that included Thomas Huxley, George Lewes, J.S. Mill, H.G. Atkinson, and Harriet Martineau.  Martineau, who translated August Comte's Positive Philosophy, published in 1851 Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development, which projected humanist unbelief as the end point of millennia of cultural improvement.  Carroll, whose speciality is the literature of this period, particularly thewritings of George Eliot, presumably knows all of this.  Yet he utters not a word about it!  Why not?  Perhaps because these facts reverse the relation between Darwin and his public that Carroll extols: far from being the mighty innovator who transforms English thought (`revolution'), he reiterates and magnifies the then aspiring progressive culture.  That culture seized on the Origin and magnified it because the weight of Darwin's high social status brought with it the promise of the triumph of progressivism (the real meaning of the `Darwinian revolution').  Indeed, one of the first reviews of Origin hailed it as `the Whitworth gun of liberalism', a clear salute to the political dimension of the evolution belief.  The author of the review was Thomas Huxley.   <br /> <br />Carroll apparently doesn't see that a Darwinian analysis of literature needs to be complemented by a literary analysis of Darwinism.   <br />
B00005JO04|5.0|Buried beneath the hectic 126 minutes of Stephen Gaghan's ambitious \\"Syriana\\" lies an impenetrable conflict: the world is apparently running out of oil, and there are people out there who want to get their hands on what's left. The question of who they are writes the kind of fate the world will have, and what their motives are will consummate that fate. \\"Ninety percent of what's left is in the Middle East,\\" says Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), an energy analyst who works for a newly merged oil company. What he says may or may not be true, but the real problem is the geographical location: the Middle East, that land which has, for centuries, been the hosting place of bitter wars and gratuitous conflicts. <br /> <br />Writer and director Stephen Gaghan has crafted a humdinger of a movie, which questions the very nature of America's international policy concerning oil. This is the cold and multilateral story of the aftermath of the merging of two major oil companies, Connex and Killen, and their perfunctory standings on oil consumption, which manages to connect with China. Observing the film from a distance, one would conclude that it is modern film noir, crediting it's influence from the Cold War paranoia films of the 1970s. <br /> <br />As far as espionage thrillers go, \\"Syriana\\" manages to stand in a category of its own. Or maybe I am putting the film on a pedestal because films like this intrigue me. Still, there are many material areas that appear to be unconventional. \\"Syriana\\" does not drift into the traditional moral gunplay of good and evil, right and wrong, Left and Right, dictatorships and democracy. We can count on Tom Clancy for those kinds of thrillers. Gaghan's film argues, from a neutral standpoint, that there are good guys and bad guys on both sides, and a deeper level of penetration is that the \\"both sides\\" can be on totally separate planes. <br /> <br />Describing the plot of the film would drive me to tears, because the film is so detailed and complex that giving a full synopsis would give everything away. What Gaghan gives us is a gallery of colorful and well-written characters, and the most important ones are played by famous actors who serve as breadcrumbs through the forest. There is Robert Barnes (George Clooney), a CIA agent who gets caught up in a messy predicament, Bryan Woodman, mentioned above, an analyst who is overseeing the finances of an oil company in Geneva, Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer), a lawyer who is overseeing the political and legal implications of the Connex-Killen merger, and Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright), Whiting's employee who is assigned to handle allegations with the Chinese. <br /> <br />By now you are probably tearing your hair out, calling me bad names, and wondering what the hell I'm talking about, but you are approaching the wrong movie if you desire to witness a linear transgression from conflict to solution. \\"Syriana\\" is submersed in conflict, with a solution that may never come to pass. What the characters experience in the movie is what tugs the film along, since things come to a near hault at several points and the screenplay becomes overwhelmed with character juggling. There were moments where I had no clue what was going on, but I was constantly drawn in by the characters themselves, their actions, their ambiguous motivations, and, more often than not, the dialogue. These people are obviously students of Shakespeare, because what they say sometimes makes no sense, but you know the undercurrents of the story and so you go with flow. <br /> <br />Most of this geopolitical mosaic is essentially people huddled together in conference rooms, offices, and restauarants discussing what they should do about the situation at hand. The situation seems unsolvable: we are running out of oil. These people seem powerless in their approach to a solution. But what we realize is that the film is all the more extraordinary because of that. What appears to be an arrogant liberal video game in the previews turns out to be a critique on global relations from outer space. <br /> <br />Stephen Gaghan is, unsurprisingly, the parent of \\"Traffic,\\" a powerful film that dissected the human nature buried beneath drug trafficking. You can definitely see the same quality here. Although it falls marginally short of total greatness, this is probably one of the most fascinating movies I have hever seen. Whenever a story crackles with suspense and drifts from locale to locale with purpose and ambition, you know that taking your eyes off the screen is next to impossible. Even if you are unable to follow it, which is the film's purpose within and of itself, you are still captivated by its shocking reality, and your skin begins to crawl because, like in \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" the horrors that are occurring onscreen are entirely possible. \\"Syriana\\" is a must see. - Isaac <br /> <br />Rated R; 126 minutes; Directed by Stephen Gaghan <br />
B00003CXA4|5.0|I would just like to agree with the reviewer below on the flaws exposed on this DVD version of Ghandi. While it IS an insult to give the American actors full billing and to ingnore the fine Indian actors on the bonus disk...I do not think it is racialy motivated. I simply believe that the stupid American Captialists selling this film prefered to give the American actors more spotlight in the special features because this DVD was marketed for an American market...and they wanted to make money. Money is thier God. The studio Ceo pigs wanted to ensure that they will get every penny out of this edition...and they were probably afraid that if they gave the Indian actors the full credit they deserved - then they would not sell as many copies. The reason is that Americans are idiots when it comes to real culture. All they want is to see the same actors over and over and over in every movie that is released now. \\"Titanic\\" had the WORST acting and screenplay EVER in a motion picture...and it was the highest grossing flick ever. I rest my case. True cinematic art is lost on the American Public.  <br />I liked the movie Ghandi. I am giving it a 5 stars because of the subject matter. And if there is a Hindi version available I would Love to see it. <br />
0684824906|3.0|The book's premise is that Abraham Lincoln was not just a great President but one who also had the motivational ability to create a highly effective team comprised of many of his rivals. These were men who had hoped to become President. Instead, they took a subservient role to a President whom Goodwin writes about in hagiographic terms.<br /><br />The team of rivals consisted of one time Republican presidential candidates William H. Seward, Secretary of State, Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary, and Edward Bates Attorney General. The other major player in this detailed work is Edwin M. Stanton, War Secretary.<br /><br />This is a good read although the author is stretched at times to continually bring the overall premise together. The opening section of the book paints individual pictures of the major players, which I did not find particularly interesting. This I think is partly because some of the characters - Chase and Bates, at least to this reader are just not compelling in their own right. Thus it takes quite some time for the book to grasp this reader's attention.<br /><br />Although peripheral to the main story, the hardships of life during the first half of the 19th century become very obvious. Chase lost three wives and two daughters before he was forty four, while Stanton between 1841 and 1846 lost his wife, a daughter and his only brother.<br /><br />Another fascinating and heart rending aspect portrayed is how the Civil War tore families apart. Four of Mary Lincoln's siblings and three brothers-in-law fought on behalf of the Confederacy, while Bate's son also took up arms for the seceding states.<br /><br />Team of Rivals is basically a biography of Lincoln with a different twist. It is not as detailed as other works - especially in relation to some Civil War episodes, because the author tries to paint pictures of so many characters. Her portrait of Lincoln to some extent lacks objectivity. Every Lincoln weakness or vacillation has a logic or rationale.<br /><br />Lincoln undoubtedly was underestimated by rivals and media. One Democratic newspaper referred to him as \\"a third rate Western lawyer ... a fourth rate lecturer, who cannot speak good grammar.\\" As a lawyer and in his early presidential years, the term \\"inspirational\\" does not come to mind. To some extent, his behavior did warrant this lack of respect.<br /><br />His lack of authority over his generals in the early stages of the war must have been disturbing for his cabinet. General McClellan treated him with a disdain and discourtesy that was mind boggling. Had Lincoln been more forceful with Generals Meade and McClellan, it is entirely conceivable the war would have ended much earlier. Kearns (and other writers) has tried to paint Lincoln as an accommodating, understanding head of state. It is probably more accurate to suggest as Martin Luther King did that he was at some stages a \\"vacillating\\" president. Much has been written about Lincoln's leadership, but I think, the student of leadership can learn as much from what Lincoln did poorly as he did well.<br /><br />Lincoln \\"grew\\" into the Presidency, winning over doubters and opponents slowly but surely with his down to earth, homely style. He most definitely has won over the author who paints Lincoln in very favorable terms no matter what the occasion. There is a tendency for the reader to become seduced by the portrait. Lincoln becomes more and more likeable, more and more presidential as the book develops. Ultimately, the reader does appreciate what a dreadful tragedy the death of this president was for the nation and almost certainly for what had been the confederate states. Although, no one can say for certain, it does seem likely that the assassinated president would have been able to salve much of the bitterness and hatred that followed the cessation of violence.rationale.  <br /> <br />Lincoln undoubtedly was underestimated by rivals and media.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Battle Star Galactica DVD's lead me to reviews of Firefly on Amazon recently, so ordered both the series and the movie--following the advice in other's comments to watch the series, then the movie. Simply delighted to discover an unknown, well crafted Sci-fi show--which Firefly certainly is.  The TV series was great fun, mixed with regret that it was all going to end too soon--its sad fate sealed and finished years earlier from corporate dictates.   <br /> <br />Once bonded to the first, short Firefly season, the movie brings  welcomed, well developed characters (with much unsaid) back to life on the screen, spewing the same clever diologue (sometimes breathlessly), some tying up loose ends.  My compliments to the special-effects guys for launching a space craft that looks like a duck and gains the effection I usually reserve for my '81 Subaru wagon. The sequence where a Reever ship follows Serenity through the Alliance battle, blazing away with a continuous ray bolt accompanied with a deep electric hum was noticably original in my book.  To great satisfaction, River's quiet, disconcerning persona is finally unleashed toward the movie's end.    <br /> <br />Genuinely sorry to see such a good cast and concept come and go as it has. I'll miss this idea. Someone should e-mail the 628 reviews here to date (just from the movie released in Sept. 2005) to the Fox gods on high to remind them they turned gold to dust. <br /> <br />As it turned out, my Firefly DVD first season set had two disc 1's--missing Disc 2.  So there are perhaps 4 more episodes to catch somewhere, someday.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This album is truly genious. Degraw has truly poured his heart and soul into this album. I'm not a soft-rock kind of girl but this album has changed my mind.

B00000260F|4.0|Reading some of these other reviews you'd think that Jeff must have been phoning it in while his producers assembled the bits and pieces just to throw new product out on the market.  The only problem with that view is the fact that this is a great album.  I've never really cared for the hit \\"People get ready,\\" so I was really pleased to find that the singer on most of the other tracks, Jimmy Hall, is in fact a major league talent.  <br />Sure this album is of its time but Beck's licks are timeless and he elevates any material that he appears on.  If you have any appreciation for late 70's Stones or 80's Santana then this album makes for a great listen.  In fact, I'll probably listen to it more often than Truth, Blow by Blow or Wired because it is a rare example of first class Beck guitar combined with good songs and great singers.  Don't fear the funk.
B000092ZYX|4.0|At 14 songs, some acoustic, some electric, some soundscape electronica, some difficult to fit in any category, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is Radiohead's most eclectic and elusive album.  Listening to it in its entirety can be exhausting and even, dare I say, difficult.  I would venture to guess that even the most ardent Radiohead fans use the skip button on their CD players or I-Pods for at least one song. <br /> <br />For me, the clear stand-out tracks are: 1. \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" with its crescendos and dramatic piano chords (Yorke again using repetition to great advantage: \\"The raindrops, the raindrops, the raindrops,\\" etc, etc., etc.); 2. the gorgeous and subtle \\"Sail to the Moon\\" showcasing Yorke at his haunting best; 3. \\"Go to Sleep,\\" featuring an (almost) \\"unplugged\\" version of the band with a curious Bob Dylan/ Paul Simon / Neil Young type feel; 4. \\"Where I End and You Begin,\\" haunting and compelling, both melodically and lyrically, and one of the two best songs on the album; 5. \\"There There,\\" the other best song, which proves that the band can rock when they want to; and 6. \\"A Punchup at a Wedding,\\" which one has to listen to several times in order to appreciate its quiet power. <br /> <br />My vote for worst all-time Radiohead song: the pretentious, annoying \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" which sounds like a poor attempt to imitate a spiritual from the deep south.  This one should have been left off.  The opening track, \\"2 plus 2 equals five\\" is fine, and curiously features Thom Yorke doing his best Johnny Lydon (a/k/a Johnny Rotten) impression.  \\"Backdrifts\\" features the electronica side of the band, and isn't bad, but frankly, I lose interest after \\"A Punchup at a Wedding,\\" which is followed by three rather mediocre songs, thinking that the album should just end already. <br /> <br />All-in-all, \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is a solid four star album, rating somewhat better than \\"Amnesiac\\" and worse than \\"Kid A,\\" with half a dozen or so very good songs.  It will be very interesting to see what Yorke and the gang come up with next.  I, for one, am hoping for more \\"Where I End and You Begin,\\" and less \\"We Suck Young Blood.\\"
B000BBOUU4|4.0|As a lover of the book and the earlier movie I was wondering what this would be. But with Burton and Depp you can't really go wrong. <br /> <br />And the movie is fun, it's pretty close to the book, with some updates to our time. Depp is brilliant as Willie Wonka. He sometimes sounds like Dr. Evil, Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' and other characters he himself played. <br /> <br />the special effects are all in good order as you would expect. Pay special attention to the remarks about other movies. I have spotted Edward Scissorhands, the Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, Space Oddity and Dracula (Christopher Lee is in it, and there is a scene where WW rises up from a table, dracula-style). But there are probably more. <br /> <br />enjoyable! as they say: from 8 to when you are only in bed at advanced age.

They played on the revolving stage, to this day from someone whom has seen many.. great concerts, this one still stands out, like Led zeps 20 min show..lol. Most people ie most critics just dont get it and never will, and Always judge for your self, never take any critics word, listen make up your own mind, and remember the era this comes from, if you can....
0441009425|5.0|If you claim that you like Science Fiction, then you've either read this book, or you need to. <br /> <br />It's not so \\"far-out\\", per se, in that characters and situations still have limitations and the science isn't perfect. In this universe that's been created for us readers, I can actually see the future being like this. <br /> <br />Understand that this is the first book in a three-book series. Alastair must have drunk a lot of tea over a lot of nights, because to call this story expansive is an understatement. You really don't even realize what's been created until you're mostly through the second book (\\"Redemption Ark\\"), and then you look over at \\"Revelation Space\\" with a mixed expression of awe and horror, because then you know that you'll need to go back and re-read it to catch the subtle things you didn't know to look for.  <br /> <br />\\"Chasm City\\" is an offshoot of this storyline, and is good, too, but I suggest reading \\"Revelation Space\\", \\"Redemption Ark\\", and \\"Absolution Gap\\" all in a row. You'll enjoy it.
B00004STPT|2.0|All the soundtracks in every movie since StarWars, and Superman (John Williams) Have been cheap unoriginal modern adaptations of creativity that was already introduced at the begining of the 20th Century. <br /> <br />Gustav Holst, Mahler, Aaron Copeland, and Igor Stravinsky are rolling in their graves! The creative evolution in this Soundtrack as well as others in this \\"Blockbuster\\" Movie category are very Adolescent in their respective artistic genres. The music of Gladiator is nonetheless enjoyable, but I find it truly deceitful to the originators of this style ripoff to call the Composers- Masters! or to call the Soundtrack a masterpiece? <br /> <br />This is truly adolescence in the sense that music if it is considered a \\"Masterpiece\\" should be original, fresh, and doing something new. Music should move forward with glimpses of the past, not entire Motifs ripped off from the real geniuses that created the originals! <br /> <br />My honest opinion.
B000301YY8|2.0|The songs are no better or worse than rock songs written over the past 10 years or so. Nothing new or innovative there. \\"Beautiful\\" sounds a lot like \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" by Joe Cocker... which was also a huge hit 25 years ago, but who NO one listens to today. <br /> <br />The voice? As good as most garage or grunge band lead singers. Scratchy, irritating to a mature ear, raspy, though he occasionally slips into a falsetto, so some may find that novel and \\"cool\\".... it's basically a gimmick and better suited to a female voice. <br /> <br />The grooming and image? Hey James, the \\"bed-head\\" look went out about 3 years ago, sleepy head.... and no, you don't look like Jim Morrison.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|My how the mighty have fallen...! The once great Avenged Sevenfold has officialy joined the MTV band wagon of nu metal losers. Its very hard for me,...man I loved their early stuff, but heck I can live without them. The vocalist Shadows had voice complications which led to the change, they tried something new and lighter and it turned out to be crap.<br /><br /> Bat Country was somewhat enjoyable and gave me some hope that they hadn't completely faded away. I then just had to go buy it....well anyways the guitar playing, drumming, bass great, but the vocals suck, as well as the songwriting. Real metal heads AVOID. Alternative fans will come to love this ablum, but from a broader point of view alot of their songs were weaker and repetive, which will bring mixed feelings about the ablum. Compare one of their earlier hits \\"Unholy Confessions\\" to \\"Bat Country\\" and you'll see a major difference.<br /><br /> If they would have kept all their songs at a fast and catchy tempo like \\"Bat Country\\",.... this ablum would be classified into the good nu metal(a rare breed). Yet, most of the time they border the emo genere. There could have been some better riffs, and more frequent solos,...and guitar action to make it a bit heavier. The gutairs are awesome, the bass was average....could of used some classic double bass. Alot of the songs also lacked sufficent lyrics,...some songs very creative while at other times just repetive. Avenged Sevenfold lays out some nasty guitar solos, but most of their tracks are barely listenable to a lover of true metal or heavy music,....the ablum has a few good points, yet most of the time the songs are more overated emo/mallcore material.<br /><br /> I see why people love \\"Bat Country\\" beyond that this ablum is a major set back for the band. They need more agression, that's plainly their style. Another sell out,....want GOOD Nu metal check out a band called Disturbed especially their new ablum \\"10,000 Fists\\" and of course \\"Down With The Sickness\\". Metal heads avoid,....mainstream MTV lovers embrace you posers.<br /><br /> Some nu metal/ alternative lovers will love this, metal fans will be disgraced and dissapointed. It all depends on your taste in music.<br /><br />Good Ablums That Blow \\"City of Evil\\" out of the water:<br /><br />\\"Waking The Fallen\\"<br /><br />\\"Sounding Of The Seventh Trumpet\\"<br /><br />1.5/5<br /><br />-Metal Expert \\"Metal CD Rater\\"ickness\\".

B000B8QEZG|5.0|24 years old, marketing director for a photography business. I never purchased a Madonna cd before but the single was like..........DANCE MAN ITS HOT. When it came on in my office my staff would look at me like I'm crazy, but she's good. The tracks flow from one to the other. If your into dance music this is the bomb album.
B000063DIR|1.0|I don't own this and won't own it. By an earlier version and hear Randy the way Randy wanted you to hear him, not the way pop superstars Ozzy and Sharon think you should hear him. Ozzy is such an idiot. How someone that can put together such a great group of musicians, year after year, can be so stupid is beyond me. Not to mention, this album is huge. You don't just go and replace people and mix down the real star of the band. Anyway, if you can find an earlier version of the CD, buy it. It's a great album when it hasn't been tampered with, other than raising the volume a bit. It's a shame people continue to support Ozzy, when all he has really done for the past 3 decades is ride the coat-tails of the person standing to his left.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Since so many have given detailed descriptions of who plays what and how, I'll just add my two cents for those of you who are still wondering whether these are a bunch of tired old geezers putting out second-rate versions of beloved classics, or virtuosos who will pin you back in your chair, hair streaming out behind you.   I listened to Cream back in the day for hours on end; they were my favorites.  I've followed Clapton through the years, and have heard most of what he's put out, and while I respect him personally, and his playing ability, and think his vocals have gotten better and better, I find him to be excellent at what he does best but surprisingly limited in the range of what he does well (just listen to him fumble along with Carlos on the otherwise fine Crossroads DVD).  So I don't expect him to amaze me anymore, unless maybe he's doing a slow blues, which he does extremely well.  OK, that being said, these shows are very, very good, and Clapton in particular is more fun to watch than in a long time.  If you liked his playing on the classic live Cream, you will not be disappointed in this.  He doesn't play \\"slow,\\" he doesn't play like he's in a \\"pub band,\\" etc. (Those who hearken back to the Cream live classics might listen to them again, and notice how repetitive Clapton's licks were; he was very exciting, and often more aggressive, but his playing is far less lick-heavy now, with an additional forty years under his belt.) (That being said, his lumbering, sluggish solo on this version of Crossroads is very disappointing to those of us who expected he'd use it as an opportunity to show us he can still rip it up.)  Those reviewers who say Bruce barely plays his bass, Baker looks like he's at death's door -- baloney. Baker looks healthier now than in 1968 (not saying much, of course).  In fact, although Bruce definitely looks somewhat the worse for wear, don't forget how decrepit they all looked back in the day.  Sure, Bruce won't blow you away these day, but they have their chops, and they use them.  Plenty of improvisation -- they give you your money's worth.  So don't worry, be happy.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|Is a great pleasure to enjoy music write for piano four hands, 2-pianos 8 hands, 4 pianos and string orchestra, and, eight pianos, all having a lot of fun playing and producing outstanding sound effects derivated from special coordinated performance, tunning and music writing. I think young early pianist students should see some of the views of six hands playing piano keyboard with diferent styles, ages and technics, but all in good shape and well coordinated.
0393327655|5.0|By page 3 I knew there would be plenty of Amazonians just waiting to hit this book over the head.  It is quite undestandable.  Sam Harris takes an extremely uncompromising and negative view of the role of religion throughout history and up to the present moment.  He even goes so far to indicate that the backwards effect of religion probably set Western Modernism back at least four centuries.  He asks us: What would it have been like if the Internet could have been set up in the early 1600's instead of now?  What if Medicine could have reached today's level 500 years ago, and so on.  These questions beg for answers under his philosophical construct.  His view may not be popular in the US, but just because some of us may not like it, doesn't mean we shouldn't think about it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Coen Bros., including Raising Arizona, and esp. Fargo, so I was expecting to enjoy this.<br /><br />What I was not expecting was that I would be absolutely enraptured by it.  I was so enveloped by the sense of place, the razor sharp acting, the constant self-inflicted misfortune, and especially the music.  The music!  What a stunning, skillfully rendered and executed soundtrack.  I didn't realize what I was missing all these years, ignoring bluegrass the way I did.<br /><br />Well, back to the movie.<br /><br />I don't have to repeat all about the movie being based on Homer's Odyssey... oops, just did.  Well, that aside, I spent some time thinking about what touched me and made this so enjoyable, more than nearly every other movie I've ever seen.  I found many things.<br /><br />Of course, the casting is delightful.  Where do you find people who can pull off Clooney's sidekicks the way they did.  If I met John Turturro or Tim Blake Nelson on the street, I would probably be just shocked to find they aren't doltish hillbillies!  John Goodman is a perfect cyclops, in a goofy, ominous, hulkish way, and Christ Thomas King, who I believe is really known for his guitar playing, still plays the understated Tommy Johnson beautifully, as if it makes perfect sense to meet the devil at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere and sell your soul to him for a good dose of guitar skill.  I could go on and on about the cast, but you won't find a sour note in there.  You'll be convinced that none of these people could live anywhere but the Depression ear South.  Before I move on from the cast, something that goes unmentioned a lot, is the brilliant performances by some of the bit players, such as Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop, Stephen Root as the Radio Station guy, and Millford Fortenberry as the Geographical Oddity storekeeper.  It may seem easy to do a small part for a little time, but this really underscores the Coen Bros. talent for getting a pitch perfect performance from every actor, no matter how small the part.<br /><br />Much has been made of the music... and rightly so!  I suppose it was less than surprising to learn that the music was actually a large part of the genesis of this movie.  You could almost say that this is a musical of sorts, not of the broadway style, but some sort of hybrid, as only the Coen Bros. can do.  My favorite musical moments are probably nearly the same as everyone else's, such as Man of Constant Sorrow.  How can you not just love that song?  The Sirens singing Didnt' Leave Nobody But the Baby with the way they used those rags for their loose-boned and sultry rhythm would certainly be tough to resist :)  O Death at a KKK rally, what a sendup that was!  The horrifying ridiculousness of that strangely choreographed scene was reminiscent of everything from the Nazi's Nuremberg rally to the Wicked Witch's guards from the Wizard of Oz (tell me you don't hear an echo of their \\"Oh we love--Noooo one\\" at the beginning of that scene.)  But I have to admit I was strangely moved and affected by my favorite scene, Down in the River to Pray, the baptism scene.  There was something beautiful, serene, and noble about those people in white, moving toward a turning point of purity and devotion down to be immersed in their new life.  I loved it, utterly.<br /><br />You may have noticed by this time that I haven't really mentioned Clooney but in passing.  There's a reason for that.  Probably the one thing that most deeply moved me was the character of Ulysses Everett McGill.  Though it's not obvious at first, I think Everett is a beautifully developed, complex character.  As the movie went on, I began to see him as insecure, loaded with good intentions, but without the inner strength to carry them out, full of regrets, yet a slave to his own passions and his desire to be admired.  When we begin to realize that what Everett's looking for is to get his wife back, the whole situation seems just delightfully silly at first.  But underneath, Clooney manages to display McGill's sensitive and wounded heart.  He's terribly insecure and masks his insecurity with too much talk and a know-it-all attitude, as well as his addiction to Dapper Dan and his own appearance.  A very telling scene is in the Geographical Oddity shop, when he obviously wants to tell off the shopkeeper who can't get his car part or his Dapper Dan for two weeks.  He's mad and looks to storm out, but instead he crumbles and buys the pomade and hair nets.  I think a lot of people miss that one.  Everett is lost in a mess of his own making and is desperate to find that one rope strong enough to pull him out of the hole he's in.  I think we all know people, or have one time *been* people who have become mired in their poor decisions and are further derailed by their attempts to circumvent the consequences.  When people like this get that one opportunity to escape their pattern of failure they often miss it, but once in a while they grab hold and make it.  I'll let you see what really happens in the movie, but George Clooney and the Coen Bros. have wrought a beautiful, tragically flawed, yet good and loving at heart protagonist and should be long recognized for it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie enough, aside from what I've mentioned, it is loaded with fun and frolic, good and evil and the strange, enormous grey area in between, tragedy and triumph.  Some of the lines and gags in this movie are priceless and the sort of thing you find yourself saying to friends at odd times just to crack things up (Do - Not - Seek - the Treasssure!)  It bears multiple watchings well, as there are so many little details to pick up on, and its fun to find the direct Odyssey references within, some of them less obvious than others.<br /><br />I'm not sure it's ever been so easy to give a movie five stars.lightfully silly at first.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|We are in the fifth year of the new rock revolution. The war is still ongoing. If you don't have bands like the Strokes you are often forced to the tepid condition of American Idol. Their last album was okay but not very daring. It was easily forgettable and forgotten. The Strokes are at that point in their career where they can just be another band or move into the higher echelons of classic rock and roll. \\"You Only Live Once\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" are a shock to the system. This is a band really evolving. Other songs like \\"Heart In A Cage\\" and \\"Razorblade\\" have some cool guitar work. One of the highlights of the album is \\"On The Other Side.\\" The Strokes have continued to stay in that Cars meets Tom Petty idiom, but they have really outdone themselves. \\"Vision of Division\\" has some prog rock moments in it. There is a lot more musical jamming on the whole album. \\"Ask Me Anything\\" is almost like an electro track. The Strokes seem to have that world-weary thing down. Most of the album is about trying to relate to the world. The album is long but the trip is worth it. For people who may have been turned off The Strokes in the past, this might be a good place to discover them. They are more mature, more interesting, have something to say, are making interesting music, and doing something worthwhile.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If a soundtrack is good enough, you can relive a great movie in your heart every time you listen to it.<br /><br />Frankly, that would be an understatement for this soundtrack.  I believe that T. Bone Burnett's masterpiece will live on as one of the icons of movie music.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of anything remotely resembling country music, yet I found myself captivated by the music herein and realized that I was truly missing out on some of the great beauty in life.<br /><br />The thing about this particular soundtrack though, is not just that it's beautiful and fun, but how perfectly it telegraphs the mood of the movie.<br /><br />My highlights:<br /><br />Big Rock Candy Mountain:  Let's you in on the fact that the escaping trio is not very rational, but rather goofy; that they're not seeking something real, but some crazy fantasy in their minds, and that the movie itself is going to be a ride which, even knowing the Odyssey, you won't be able to predict.  As a song on its own, it's beautifully cheeky and understated and transports you to a little gathering out on the ol' porch in Appalachia where there's nothing but the stars and the fire and the family and friends.<br /><br />Man of Constant Sorrow:  The centerpiece of the movie.  In a way it's the rock n' roll of the period, a little more edgy, exciting, with tragic lyrics that a down-trodden people of Depression could identify with.  Both versions are rip-roaring fun, though I prefer the radio station version for it's paucity and simplicity.<br /><br />I'll Fly Away:  I've always loved this old gospel tune anyway, and Allison and Gillian bring back the sense of the old time hymn sing and the simple beauty of two part harmony.<br /><br />Po' Lazarus:  Wow, what sorrow and pain, the shadow of slavery and the hope of the pathetic, downtrodden man for whom there is no hope on this side of heaven.<br /><br />Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby:  That sultry, rag-whipping rhythm, and that gorgeous, close three part female harmony.  Any man would be hard pressed to walk away from those sirens.<br /><br />Angel Band:  Oh, man I love this song so much, so simple, and such a beautiful message of faith.  My only knock on this CD is that I wish they had a version of it with the kids singing as they did at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Down in the River to Pray:  I guess you realized that I would highlight this one most of all.  There is a such a sense of faith, trust, turning, redemption, restoration, and love in this song.  I remember being nearly moved to tears by this scene, and in fact the first time I heard the song on its own, so simple and so lush, I did have to wipe away a couple of tears.  Even if the rest of the CD had been terrible, I would gladly have paid double just to have this version of the song.<br /><br />This soundtrack is as beautiful as it is unique, and will come to define the pinnacle of excellence in song-based soundtracks for years to come.gorgeous, close three part female harmony.

B0009Z5R3Q|5.0|It is 2006 already, and we have maybe the first exciting new band of the year. I first heard this record on the Rodney Bingenheimer show one late night. I thought it was a new obscure Interpol track. Of course I heard the whole album, and it seems that there is another band from England who loves Joy Division and some of the more forgotten post-punk bands. Singer Tom Smith even sounds more like Ian Curtis than Paul Banks does. On the first two tracks, Editors have the atmosphere of U2 (1982) more so than Joy Division. Like some post-punk bands, like Echo and The Bunnymen, Editors have a lot of dynamic with their two guitars, rather than being bass driven like Joy Division. Some of the songs like \\"Blood\\" and \\"All Sparks\\" are very catchy and remarkable. This band is no copyist. There are slow moody pieces and faster dancey songs like \\"Someone Says\\" which is more like Bloc Party. When you think that there is nothing left, they come up with a killer track like \\"Bullets\\" which has the repeating phrase \\"You don't need this disease.\\" There is a very hopeful yearning on most of the songs. The presentation is rather sparse and architectural. Most of the songs have one-word titles. Editors is all about saying more with less. I look forward to seeing them play live.

B00006IU73|5.0|Here is a rundown of each song: <br /> <br />Blackest Eyes: This is the best opening song ever made. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br />Trains: Perfect song, beautiful, and most people's favorite PT song, I have found. <br /> <br />Lips of Ashes: Seen as a transition song, this actually holds its own as a brilliant gem. This is probably PT's best makeout/hookup song, and has such nice harmonies and atmosphere. Wow. <br /> <br />The Sound of Muzak: One of PT's greatest riffs, this used to be my favorite song of all time, but I think I listened to it a few too many times...still terrific and innovative.  <br /> <br />Gravity Eyelids: This song must grow on you, but the second verse, when the bass comes in, might be my favorite PT moment of all.  <br /> <br />(By the way, I'm really not exaggerating about these) <br /> <br />Wedding Nails: Awesome! PT's heaviest song yet (at that point), this instrumental is just killer and never gets old. Great riff and jam section in the middle. <br /> <br />I must interrupt my rundown to say this: After listening to the first six songs, it is safe to say that if the album continues to be this good, it is easily the best album of all time. Unfortunately, the album gets worse in the second half... :( <br /> <br />Prodigal: Eh. Kinda boring I guess, it has its moments though, and an awesome ending, with a great drum fill. <br /> <br />.3: This is not a very good song. Some cool harmonies but other than that pretty dull. <br /> <br />The Creator Has a Mastertape: It takes a lot of listens to really absorb this track, as it is the busiest song on the album, but I think it's great. The riff is very different than what PT normally does, and extremely dark overall, but works great for the tone of the album. <br /> <br />Heartattack in a Layby: Here's the thing with this one. I have listened to this song many times on the CD, and was never thoroughly blown away with it. Then, when I saw it live, it absolutely got me, the harmonies at theend are just sublime. Terrific song. <br /> <br />Strip the Soul: Not as good as everyone says it is, and sounds a lot like .3, which is a big thumbs down, but still okay. <br /> <br />Collapse the Light into Earth: I don't know how I can say this really, but I don't like this one at all. Probably my least favorite PT track of all.  <br /> <br />This album still gets 5 stars, just because of the first half, and if ONLY the last 6 could keep up with the first.
B00005JOII|3.0|It's ironic that \\"Match Point\\" has earned Woody Allen some of the best reviews of his career, because it's a film that has just about nothing in common with the other 40-odd movies he's made. As a fan of his, I have to say if I didn't know in advance he'd directed it, I probably wouldn't have guessed -- Mike Hodges or Mike Figgis or Stephen Frears or Neil Jordon, maybe, but not Allen.    For starters, this is a dramatic thriller, not a comedy, and it takes place in London, far from the director's beloved New York streets and apartments. There's none of Allen's usual jazz on the soundtrack, only operatic selections, particularly a mournful Enrico Caruso performance of Donizetti's \\"Una furtiva lagrima.\\" And there are no jokes, either; there's some humor, but no actual punchlines and none of the self-deprecation that typically trips from the mouths of Allen's characters.     As the movie begins, a young tennis instructor named Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) makes fast friends with suave aristocrat Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Tom introduces Chris to his family and before long Chris has a job in their business and is dating Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), who defines the phrase \\"nice enough.\\" Chris doesn't protest too much over his good fortune (actually he protests just enough to get exactly what he wants) until he meets Tom's girlfriend, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an American who looks exactly like a woman named Nola should look, which is to say: fairly smokin' hot. And that's when things get complicated.    \\"Match Point\\" is a cold, calculated movie, and while Allen has turned down the directorial temperature in the past (in movies such as \\"Interiors\\" and \\"Another Woman\\") this time he seems to be channeling one of Patricia Highsmith's sharp-edged \\"Ripley\\" books. The change of climate works well and Allen is surprisingly good at ratcheting up the tension and depicting a little shotgun violence.    It's a shame, though, that Rhys-Meyers' tennis pro isn't a more interesting protagonist. He has eyes that manage to be both intense and kind of blank, and he's mostly callow, neither very sympathetic nor enjoyably devious. As his foil, Johnansson makes a formidable femme fatale, but the movie kind of stacks the deck against both her and Mortimer and eventually turns their characters into one-dimensional nags.    The rest of the cast is solid, but a little underused. Goode's velvety-smooth brother-in-law is exponentially more engaging than the lead, and I wouldn't have minded an entire movie centered around the police detectives played by Ewan Bremner and James Nesbitt; it's also too bad that the great, owlish Brian Cox, who plays a cryptic father, isn't given more to do.    Those faults, however, don't prevent the movie from being an engrossing old-school potboiler. \\"Match Point\\" plays by the numbers just long enough to throw viewers off, then gets suitably dark toward the end (especially with a chilly scene in which the dead speak). It may not be highly original -- in fact, it owes quite a lot to Allen's masterpiece, \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" -- but it's a precise little stopwatch of a movie, and one that might surprise Allen's fans and detractors alike.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Of course I hate musicals (it's a guy thing; you wouldn't understand) but the musical Cabaret is my favorite film.  It nearly tells us how ordinary Germans let Hitler happen.   <br /> <br />Among other miseries, democracy gave post-WWI Germany Liza Minnelli & the Kit Kat Cabaret, emblematic of a nation that lost its way and lost its honor.  Cabaret, the symbol and the film, is a swamp and cesspool of decadence and decline.  Minnelli is perfectly cloying and annoying, someone who counterfeits the act of acting in a movie that's about the sick surface of things.  All ze girls are beautiful, except Minnelli.  Joel Grey is beautiful, a mascara'd marriage of Goebbels and Mapplethorpe. Everything here is beautiful in its own way if beauty and purpose are discounted as uncounted casualties of blood, iron, vomit, poison, trenches, and lost war.  Inside the Cabaret everything is beautiful, dark, and sick;  a democratic republic is eating itself, ripping itself apart. <br /> <br />Then in a magic moment the din and the sin are gone.  Outside, at a biergarten very far from Minnelli and Grey, there is sunlight and pure song.  Ordinary, defeated, torpid Germans hear and glimpse renewal: a blond boy, ultimate-Aryan blond, singing at first alone and then with dozens and then hundreds as the camera pans down from his blindingly blond head to the red-and-black banner on his arm. And tomorrow belongs, and tomorrow belongs to me.

B000E6ESL2|5.0|It's true that this film sat on the shelf for a long time and did horribly at the box office. That can be bad news, but in this case, it simply means that no one knew how to market this film. It was advertised as a horror film, but is more of a Hitchcockian/arthouse film than anything.  <br /> <br />This is not a film for everyone, but for those who enjoy films that make you think about the art of the film itself, not just about some supposedly profound 'message' being pushed, this is a great film. Roger Ebert has nailed this film on the head in his review.  <br /> <br />
B000001EYW|5.0|You don't have to be a Bee Gees fan to love this CD. <br />It is brilliant!. <br />Lovely collection of songs. <br />It can put you in \\"the mood\\" for anything!. <br />You would \\"kick\\" yourself if you didn't buy it!.
0553573403|3.0|First off, I am no expert on fantasy books. This was my first fantasy book I read from cover to cover so I cannot compare this to other fantasy books. However, since I did read it from cover to cover, it can only mean that it didn't suck. I would have liked little less detail and more action. If all other fantasy books are this much detailed, I think this will be my last one.<br /><br />One good thing about this book was that all the characters are flawed in someway. I do not care for the \\"hero can do no wrong\\" stories and this isn't it.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing Clash of the Kings. Instead, I will borrow it from the library as I find this series interesting but not exciting enough to spend even $7 for a paperback.

7119005901|5.0|You should. Three Kingdoms is the number 2 bestseller in the history of mankind after King James Bible. Couple billion readers cannot be wrong so have your faith in this book.  <br /> <br />Three Kingdoms.... I read it about 8 times now. Everytime I read it, I learn something new or see a different point of view according to my own maturity.  <br /> <br />You can talk about Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.  <br /> <br />Part fiction, part history, get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none. You have just found the book of your dreams.
B000001GAJ|5.0|If you didn't know these were early works, you'd assume they were the dazzling works of a mature virtuoso.  I had never heard them or heard of them before until stumbling on them via a search for Argerich recordings and I was completely bowled over from the first bars.  I was so impressed and fascinated that I listened to the CD over and over that weekend.  While I have a terrific home theater system, the sound recording on this CD is clearly above average: it's sumptuous and clear at the same time.  That also goes for the performances which are crisp, dynamic, seductive, and have a dynamism all their own.  They have given me even more respect for Mendelsohn's genius and the artistic excellence of the two soloists.  I have rarely enjoyed a new CD so much.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|so your going to read some other reviews that say something along the lines of \\"good album but not the korn they used to be\\" heres an idea for all those people... how bout korn keeps playing the same songs for you over and over and doesn't grow as people or artists. Of course they're not the same as they were 10 years ago, but neither are chicken mcnuggets, things change. Bottom line, i bought it, i like it, and i recommend it
B000BRBA8S|2.0|I believe Kar Wai Wong is one of the greatest directors this planet has ever seen.  His ability to bring images and characters together cannot be compared to any other living director.  He is original, energetic, and all together poetic with his form and style.  Wong's work is what those infamous directors of Hollywood dream about at night.  I was impressed with his gripping tale of love in Happy Together and mesmerized by his emotionally draining film In the Mood for Love.  Wong is brilliant behind the camera, creating some of the most beautiful visuals ever to grace the silver screen.  Alas, I can spend all day here speaking about this master's work, but it doesn't conceal the fact that 2046 was not his best work released.  As a man who enjoyed Happy Together and In the Mood for Love, I was expecting nothing short of perfection with this film, yet somehow, I did not get it.  I believe I was duped by the marketing behind this film.  I must warn others that if you are renting this film expecting a science fiction film, you will be greatly disappointed.  I even thought that it would follow a path similar to Blade Runner, but again, I was wrong.  After watching 2046 all I could think about was Wong's refrigerator.  This film reminded me of all the leftovers in Wong's fridge.  If you took all the elements that made his prior films extraordinary and slopped them together on one plate, threw it in the microwave, and watched it cook, than you would be experiencing 2046.  This film was nothing more than Wong's leftovers handed to us in hopes we wouldn't see through the charade.<br /><br />Harsh words, I agree, but I didn't feel the emotional strain, the power of the characters, or the challenge of the story as I did with his prior two films that I experienced.  Kar Wai Wong is a brilliant cinematographer, capturing some of the most beautiful images in film, I believe though that he didn't quite know what to do with them all in this film.  In 2046, we are handed, nearly pounded down, with image after glorious image of characters attempting to build their lives together.  With pastels, blurred backgrounds, and off centered camera angles, Wong has created one of the most beautiful films of 2005!  Yet, no amount of beauty can honestly disguise leftovers.  Everyone in the house knows what you are serving, there is no need to literally color-coat it.  One of the images that annoyed me greatly was that centered around Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Ziyi Zhang in a taxicab after a night of drinking.  We even revisit it later in the film, but was annoyed me about this scene is that it is exactly the same scene from Happy Together, nearly cut and pasted onto another film.  The final conclusionary remarks of this film were completely reused from In the Mood for Love, while breathtaking in its own sense, it just didn't work for me to have all of these repetitive scenes.  I wanted creative Kar Wai Wong, but all I was handed was a poorly spliced reprint of his older films.<br /><br />Science fiction is a difficult genre to handle.  A GOOD sci-fi film is a rarity.  2046 is not a science fiction film.  For those considering this film due to the sci-fi press that it received, you will be surely misguided.  There are moments in the film that are supposed to be in our future, but they are so poorly crafted that they distract from the already budding story.  I believe it is these science fiction \\"train\\" elements were cheap, dull, and completely underdeveloped.  In fact, they stole from the rest of the film.  In 2046, it is not uncommon for you to find yourself completely caught up in a character, learning about their mannerisms and challenges, only to be snapped into this random world which trains have apparently become the dominate species.  While other praise Wong's work in these moments of the film, I believe them to be very unlike Wong.  These paper mache science fiction elements were not the reasons I first fell in love with Wong's work.  While changing genres may work well for the likes of Spielberg and Ang Lee, for Wong it doesn't.  Wong does better with his character driven stories that are simple, yet beautiful enough to keep your eyes on the screen.  2046 was so poorly developed that sleep seemed like a better option, and I hate to say that about Wong's work.<br /><br />The characters were decent with the material they were given.  Ziyi Zhang gives a Nicole Kidman-esque performance that should open up more and more doors for her.  Her range is amazing, and I think that Wong captured it extremely well.  This was less of a character-developed story and more of an actual plot, which is where I believe Wong theoretically shot himself in the foot. Wong need to keep with characters and beautiful scenery and his stories will then just fall into place.  I must admit, this was a confusing tale.  I was intrigued one minute and befuddled the next.  2046 is not a film for the light of film watchers.  It is not your \\"date night\\" film, but instead one that needs to be watched with microscopes attached to your eyes to ensure that you do not miss any elements.  I, a novice film watcher, had trouble following this film.  Wong didn't fully have his direction tied on tightly enough with this film.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't impressed. I could not watch this film again.  I saw what Wong wanted to accomplish with this film, I do not think that he had enough control over the finished product.  2046 reminded me of my first thesis paper.  I knew what my thesis wanted to be, but it was buried so deep within my paper that it ultimately ruined the entire body of work.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****ing genres may work well for the likes of Spielberg and Ang Lee, for Wong it doesn't.

0757302661|5.0|I don't know what promoted your desire to support O'Neill, but you are wrong in all categories. O'Neill may have thought in her head that HypnoBirthing was a catchy idea, but she never promoted it. If she has any proof that she created the term, she has never delivered any proof to Marie Mongan or the Federal Government and has never had a lawyer represent her even though her husband (assuming she is still married)is an attorney. The fedarel government has awarded to Marie Mongan, the trademark for HypnoBirthing(R).
0307276902|2.0|Originally I read this book as non-fiction and thought that it had a real quality to its writing a \\"raw\\", unedited, run-on sentence, no structure sort of feel. But now that I no that it is fiction i had to change my rating from four to two. As a fiction novel it is flat out horrible novel and i can see why it got rejected from 17 publishing companies before it was picked up.
0060536357|5.0|Excellent.  This book is to Private Equity what Monkey Business is to Investment Banking and Liars Poker is to Bond Traders.  A must read for any one who deals with Wall Street.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love this CD soooooooo much! My favorite songs are Love Me Do, Let It Be, Paperback Writer, A Hard Day's Night, All You Need Is Love, Get Back and I Want to Hold Your Hand. BUT ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND I LOVE THE BEATLES!
B00005JOQ9|1.0|This is just a shameful movie.  The whole idea that people would enjoy this movie sickens me.  That is what I find genuinely gross about this movie.    No, I didn't waste a single dime on this movie, but I did get the chance to spy a bit of it while waiting for Munich.  I saw enough of it to get the whole premise.  Once more, and what I loved about this, is when our audience came out of the Munich, the audience members of Hostel from another showing were coming out.  They all looked like a bit of their spirit was sucked out of them.    Munich was a violent movie in its own right, but the violence served a purpose in speaking of the inhumanity that can arise out of what might first seem a morally acceptable thing: revenging murder.  We quickly see that violence knows no limit and grows in its demand for mayhem and soon what might have begun with a more morally sound foundation crumbles beneath an ever strengthening wave of blood-thisty want for spilling more blood.    In Hostel, in contrast, the violence tells no tale of darkness.  Instead, the darkness is just glorified, and like the golden calf, whorishly worshipped for all to see and take part in adoring.  In a very real sense, the moive itself, if you think about it, is the Hostel portrayed in the movie.  Here, the lure of sex on the screen, lures a young sexually charged audeince, primarily young males, who then have their minds warped for some 90 minutes.  I saw their faces, and they were f*cked to put it delicately.  They just didn't realize it.  I am sure that in the future, neuroscientists will demonstrate without a shadow of doubt that movies and experiences like this actually physically rewire the brain.  I am far from an \\"old fuddy duddy\\" but I am more and more believing the case of rising violence and desentisation to it is due to violent realistic movies and video games.      If Eli Roth wanted to really show the inhumanity of the world, why not a documentary on say the human organ black market, where the poor are taken horrific advantage of daily, paid a low sum of money for their kidney or how we Westerners are more interested in paying over 10 dollars to see a  pointless movie like this that celebrates murder and cruelty instead of donating $5 to countries in Africa, in which $5 would help eliminate malaria, which claims millions of lives each year.    Something is terribly wrong with the world when a movie is not uplifting the spirit but designed to take part of it away and foster a sense that life is cheap and unworthy of fundamental respect and is not inherently precious.  That to me is the sickest part of the whole premise behind this movie.
B0009X7664|5.0|A most for your tape library.  Everyone can relate to this magnificent story!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Having recently read the Stephen King book, I felt I should watch the movie to see John Carpenters interpretation. Although many details are cut out for time reasons the whole of the story remains true and intact. I love the characters and love the struggle in the movie between the car, Arnie, and Dennis. The visuals are great and the music is cool too. Make this a part of your collection.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd is without a doubt one of the most influential bands of all time!  And the 2-disc \\"Echoes\\" collection is proof!  Although, every REAL Floyd fans needs to have more than this record....this is a great place to start out!  \\"Echoes\\" Features some of Floyd very best material, no arguments with that!  Although the tracks are from a variety of different records, they've managed to put these 2 records together perfectly.  If You Like these records, i'de then recommend..\\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", And \\"The Wall\\".  Peace
B00004UFTU|5.0|What a first album! Such a harmony exists only if the members of the band share the same ideas,dreams,thoughts,musical feelings.Fish's voice is: gentle,angry,soft,harsh,melancholic,mercurial.His range of emotions is infinite!The bass guitar by itself is a symphony.A lot of off time drums and bass.Very progressive keyboards.That is what i call ART-ROCK! Fish has the ability to transform his feelings into a poetry with unique style.Marillion( with Fish)is not easy to be assimilated.It is not for everybody(and that is the beauty of it).Fish's Marillion is very misjudged and unproperly appreciated(mainly in the US,like many other bands and singers[for example: Van Der Graaf Generator,Atomic Rooster  <br />Blood,Sweat&Tears,Styx,Kansas,The Alan Parsons Project,Glen Hughes,The Boomers YYZ,Terence Trent D'Arby,Demis Roussos and Aphrodite's Child,Chris Rea,Supermax, Sam Brown,Vaya Con Dios,Clannad,Incognito,Jamiroquai,Infectious Grooves etc.] On ,the radio you can listen to Led Zeppelin,The Who,Rod Steward <br />Black Sabbath and other bands that i used to like,but come on-every day,365 days a year,only the most popular songs[ by their opinion],i'm sick and tired of it!But let's get back to Marillion. I love the music,the lyrics. All 4 studio albums with Fish are a work of art.There is an album called \\"B'sides Themselves\\",import-i recomend it to everybody who is into Marillion.Expand your mental outlook \\"...but don't be fooled by the radio,the T.V.or the magazines,they'll show you photographs  <br />of how your life should be,but they're just someone else's fantasy...\\"-STYX \\"The Grand Illusion\\"1977
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington is one of the best actors if not the best actor in the history of movie making. He further validates that with his performance as Alonzo Harris, a rogue veteran detective with questionable behavior. Ethan Hawke is equally outstanding as Jake Hoight, Alonzo's idealistic and conscious rookie partner. The story really takes off when Jake discovers the other side of Alonzo. Now it's a battle of wills as Jake sets out to stop Alonzo once and for all. This is a kick ass movie with great action and an excellent story line. Like Alonzo's phrase, this is a boom!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Of course, being a fan of the short-lived TV series, perhaps my opinion is biased.  Still, this movie is one of those genre-bending, fast-paced quirky films that appeal to many types of people on many types of levels.   <br /> <br />With top-notch special effects, the sci-fi buffs get a good taste of a possible future--not the traditional Star Wars/Star Trek ultra-hi-tech, all-is-good world.  It's 500 years in the future, and yes, there are still no aliens!  Get over it. <br /> <br />Western fans can really appreciate the witty banter, gun-slingin' action, and quite impressive fight choreography. <br /> <br />There's enough romance to entertain the ladies; the characters are fresh, exciting, flawed and dedicated.  The actors are top-notch, if not well known, and bring a fresh look into a new world. <br /> <br />The network might have made a mistake in canceling the show, but you don't have to make a mistake by missing this movie.  Check it out.
B000BJS4BM|4.0|So much has already been said about \\"Confessions\\", it's all dance, all Madonna, and all gay.  But in truth, it's light years behind Madonna's \\"Madonna\\"...the last true Madonna dance record.  Starting with \\"Hung Up\\" and straight through to \\"Jump\\" the album soars with very little flat notes.  Madonna is great at writing stunning pop/dance tracks; \\"Sorry\\", \\"Get Together\\", and \\"Forbidden Love\\" are truly remarkable.  But the latter half of the album falls short.  It seems of late, Madonna's song writing lose much of the impact of latter years and she seems content to match her words even if it doesn't make sense (the fan clube only \\"Super Pop\\" anyone?).  On this \\"Special Edition\\" release, fans are given the chance to write their own confessions via an included journal, have the chance to join Madonna's fan club (and download the rare \\"Super Pop\\"), and take a listen to the bonus track \\"Fighting Spirit\\".  Which isn't half bad (far better than the latter half of the offical \\"Confessions\\" release).  All in all this album hasn't been promoted in the US at--Madonna has been spending most of her time in the UK and Europe) but has done fairly well.  More Madonna-lite fans it will all make sense, but for those who truly understand the prowess of \\"she who is\\" even this \\"Special Edition\\" falls slightly short of a classic.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles are one of a kind. Their music has endured decades and will live on as some of the best music ever produced. They understand the concept of concert performances and have the ability to make live music sound just as it does on their albums. Not even the Rolling Stones can accomplish that! <br />I highly recommend this 2 disc set, it contains some of the world's biggest hits!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly offers a feast to those starving for decent characters and story in film. Firefly is proof that film need be neither shallow nor amoral to be art. We must be grateful Firefly slipped through Hollywood's mediocrity sieve undetected for the diamond it is. Can Wheeden do it again? I pray so.
B000025XKM|5.0|I do not need to reiterate the other reviewers' analyses concerning the technical aspects of the music on this album, other than to state that it is all true (5 stars). Musically, the CD is a supreme technical achievement. More importantly, however,  the CD is truly an inspired piece of art in every sense of the word. The songs were written, composed and played while the artist was in the throes of depression. The collection as a whole is a swan song for this musician.  <br /> <br />It is this combination of the artist's technical genius and his intense level of emotional inspiration that make this such a timeless, profound and moving CD.  I have listened to the CD at least 50 or 60 times in the last few months. It is simply that original,  and emotionally affecting.....it is simply that exceptional. It was no suprise to me, that Sufjan Stevens, another talented musician that I recommend,  lists this as his favorite CD.
B000000OUJ|5.0|WU TANG IS NOT A MARKETING SCHEME. THEY'RE A REAL TRUE HIP HOP GROUP AND THIS ALBUM IS PROOF OF THAT!!!!
B000068QY7|3.0|Really 2.5 stars.  People who have read my other reviews know I am a big Oasis fan.  No other rock band of the past 15 years has put out such a huge volume of high quality music.  Oasis' first two albums are straight up classics.  I also think \\"Be Here Now\\" is one of the most underrated albums of the 90's and will be recognized as a classic in time.  Oasis' newest, \\"Don't Believe the Truth,\\" is great as well-- as good as anything they've ever done.  I am sure they have a lot more in them as well. <br /> <br />That said, \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is a really weak performance.  It's slightly better than \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants,\\" but that's not saying much.  In all, there are really only three decent songs here-- \\"The Hindu Times,\\" \\"Hung In a Bad Place,\\" and \\"Better Man.\\" <br /> <br />The production sucks too.  The production on \\"Be Here Now\\" was big and loud, but so were the songs.  The songs on \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" just can't stand up to all of this clutter.  Noel was smart to hand over the production reigns to someone else for \\"Don't Believe the Truth.\\" <br /> <br />Like \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants,\\" \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is an album that only hardcore fans will want.  Still, the fact that Oasis put out two crappy albums doesn't mean they're not a great band.  Out of their 7 major releases, 5 have been great.  Look at how many awful albums the Stones and Bob Dylan have put out
B000009EAD|5.0|I'm sure some fans are going to be appalled and throw rocks at me for saying this, but I wasn't that big on Iced Earth. That was before I heard their fifth album, that is. \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\\" is doubtlessly this band's finest hour (based on what I've heard--I don't own every Iced Earth C.D.). The drumming is energetic, the guitars are usually downright exciting, and some songs feature foreign instruments (\\"1776\\" has a flute solo and \\"Blessed Are You\\" includes a mandolin.) Matt Barlow's vocal performance is also quite impressive; he usually sounds like a cross of Tony Dio and Bruce Dickinson, but on some songs (like the album closer) he even ascends to sound somewhat like Rob Halford. Matt has a great voice for singing clearly, and he sometimes even digs deep to pull out his surprisingly soulful upper register.<br /><br />The main reason why I think \\"Something Wicked\\" is Iced Earth's most infectious, exciting, and all around strongest effort is because of the great slow-fast and soft-hard friction that this album (and many of these songs) have. There are a few songs (like \\"Stand Alone\\" and \\"My Own Savior,\\" which has a buzzsaw rhythm) which are blisteringly fast and heavy, but most of the tracks on  here are both heavy and melodic. Songs like \\"Melancholy\\" (a power ballad) and \\"Blessed Are You Something Wicked\\" are largely slow and restrained, but have hard choruses. And \\"Watching Over Me\\" (a song featuring a guest guitar solo by Jim Morris) and \\"Consequences\\" are partially acoustic, but mostly crunchy.<br /><br />And the rest of this album is jam-packed with goodies, too.  \\"Disciples Of The Lie\\" has big, churning riffs and also an instrument which sounds like an organ. \\"1776,\\" which is an instrumental with a stellar, fast, running guitar lead, is maybe my favorite song on here. \\"Prophecy\\" starts out slowly, but its wailing guitars make the beat work up quite a bit of momentum and speed. Finally, the album ending track, is almost an epic song since it nearly reaches ten minutes in length. It begins with a cool piano solo, but the rest of it is pretty fast and riff-heavy.<br /><br />So, this album is nothing short of a masterpiece. Plus, since I wasn't a huge fan of this band before I heard this album (but when I did hear it, it blew me away), \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is recommended to all types of Iced Earth fans. No matter what type of metal fan you are, this C.D. is well worth your time and money.en minutes in length. It begins with a cool piano solo, but the rest of it is pretty fast and riff-heavy.

B00005JOQ9|5.0|For everyone who didn't like this movie: There is an endless supply of serial killer themed , rehash horror sequels with trendy twenty-something stars just oozing out of Hollywood every other weekend. They are destined to end up covered in dust at your local Blockbuster's bargain bin waiting for your consumption. You can go pick them up after church or whatever \\"feel good\\" activities you do to cleanse yourself of your personal issues.  You can ignore this movie and remain like the other 70% of Americans who never applied for a passport.      Hostel is a very timely reverse exploitation film.  I honestly have not seen an American horror movie this good since the 80s. As if most American men didn't realize 50% of the porn they consume comes from some Eastern European country willing to exploit their youth for anyone willing to pay. Do you really think the underground sex market in most underprivileged countries caters to locals?  Also, this movie is tame compared to most things Americans condone as foreign policy (Hostel gives nod to America's acceptance to their own secret \\"interrogation\\" prisons).      For anyone who has traveled and bumped into those annoying American tourists behaving like they never would behave in the states, this is some vindication. Yes, I feel it could have even been gorier. However, what is here was sufficient to make my wife run to the bathroom and puke so be warned. People actually were applauding when it ended (as in they liked it).       Wow, Frank Simmons was really bothered by this movie and my praise of it. If Hostel wasn't effective, would he have bothered to write such a long winded and obvious rebuke?  I stick by everything I said.  I don't feel a need to go into specifics, shed light on all of his double standards or point out how many times he misquoted what I actually wrote.  Sometimes movies don't need to literally cite a relevant situation to make one consider an analogy.  This kind of allusion is common in art, literature andmusic, not that this movie is in the same category.  Don't act so reactionary Frank. You can like this movie and still feel proud to be an American.  I would try to be more open minded to the mechanisms used in these kinds of narratives.  Sometimes an open-ended interpretation is sufficient (I usually do not expect much from \\"soft-porn category and the blood-gore category\\" movies).  Also, I believe the \\"Twist\\" is a cheap and overdone narrative device used to provide a culmination without addressing the more ambiguous and usually more interesting aspects in horror movies (High-Tension & Saw).      By the way Frank, if you are going to use big intelligent words while calling me dumb and dim-witted, at the very least use the correct spelling (opprobrium, not opprobium).  Now if you change it everyone will know.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Christopher Nolan set out to make the best Batman movie possible.  He spared no expense.  He recalled looking at the success of the first Superman movie back in 1978 and decided that part of making the film work was having the right cast.  Christopher Nolan more than succeeded in his aim!  Snatching up some of the best actors around in Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and even the young talents of Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy helped make this, not only the best Batman adaptation ever done but one of the best comic book adaptations of all time.<br /><br />Nolan also made sure to find a screenwriter who was familiar with the Batman universe.  He looked at various bodies of work from Frank Miller to other graphic novels as well, trying to find the best story and the best medium for making the movie.<br /><br />First, Christian Bale NAILS the role of BOTH Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Reports are that he put on nearly 100 pounds...so much that he, in fact, had to drop some weight in order to fit into the suit!  He makes Wayne more of a philanthropic playboy who is more interested in cars and women than about the corrupt state of Gotham City.  But as the Dark Knight he is relentless and brutal in his mission to make crimelords and corrupt public officials pay and pay with interest!  You gotta love the scene where Batman snatches Detective Fass off the ground from 10 stories up.  \\"I don't know anything, I swear to God!\\" cries Fass.  \\"Swear to ME!\\" Batman growls at him.

B000F6IOBQ|5.0|I haven't seen a sequel this good since Terminator 2! They really went back in history to give so much more storyline, or just added to the original story in such a clever way. They also did a great job in out-doing the killings from part 1! I was so intrigued by this movie I felt like I got my moneys worth in the first 20 minutes. The director did a great job of bringing you into his underworld. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part ot this story anymore. It isn't mostly centered on love like the first movie, however it is all there, from love, to the long history, to time jumping. <br /> <br />I love this movie like I love giving my daughter anal!
068987474X|3.0|I wish I had read this book when I was younger. I spent my best years with all the various characters in this book. I had more than a few married men I was enthralled with, a couple of real freaks, a disappearing act, a few serious drug users, alcoholics figure in there and yes, a slew of decent guys who loved me that I ditched because they didn't make my heart sing. Now I am 55 and alone. I don't know if I would have listened to the advice in the book because I was headstrong. But I recommend all of you girls (and grown women) who are wasting your time with Mr. Wrong I, II and III to take a serious look at what you're doing. Being 55 and single is no fun. My past annoys me in the wee hours and the field is now very narrow. Proceed with caution.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|panic! at the disco is an amazing band with room to grow. their songs may be catchy but do not lack in lyrical quality as most bands do.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never watched it until I saw the movie \\"Serenity\\". Loved the movie and bought the TV Series DVD Set and couldn't stop watching until I was done. Can't believe I missed it originally or that it was ever cancelled.
B000BGH22W|5.0|No, it's not as good as the Prisoner Of Azkaban soundtrack, but it's still excellent.  The standouts are \\"Harry In Winter\\", which John Williams would be happy to call his own, \\"Do The Hippogriff\\", a fun rocker played during part of the Yule Ball scene, \\"The Story Continues\\", the movie opener which is a scarier take on the traditional \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", \\"The Dark Mark\\", the seriously spooky \\"Frank Dies\\" \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\", \\"Another Year Ends\\", and \\"Hogwarts Hymn\\".
0307276902|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  So what if some of it was embellished, I think all writers do that. As for Oprah I think her true feelings came out on Larry King when she stood up for the book. Then only because shes \\"Oprah\\" and no one should embarass her she changed her tune entirely. Why do so many look to Oprah as the final word?  I watched CNN and the man who was \\"Miles\\" in the book called in, he said that as far as he knows the story is true, at least James story in rehab is. I think I'll listen to Miles (Alan Green) over Oprah. So if you want a good read this is very well written, I plan on reading My Friend Leonard too.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|If you like unique vampire movies.  I would like to suggest that you give Underworld unrated 2 disk extended cut a try.  Underworld is a story of Selene (vampire, death-dealer), and a human turned lycan (Lycan is short for one who has the lycanthropy virus.  Meaning one, who had been bitten by a werewolf.)      Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, Sophia Myles plays Erica very well, and she can also be seen in the new movie Tristan and Isolde.    Needless to say, I think Underworld is the most unique vampire movie since Innocent Blood, and the extended version of the movie on DVD is chock-full of extras.  So, if you liked the movie, you'll love the DVD.  If you haven't seen the movie, like vampire movies in general, and want to see the beginning, before you go see Underworld Evolution, please check out the extended cut of Underworld.  It's well worth the money.
B000BYA5G4|3.0|First of all, I'm concerned about the number of people who think that this is news--\\"an eye-opener\\".  Where have you been?  In that respect, maybe this is a somewhat important film.    Anyway:    This movie is similar to Goodfellows and Casino in that there is a narrator (Nicholas Cage) and ambient tunes to the scenes; unfortunately, the execution is inept.    The narration wasn't interesting; it was uninspired and unecessary.      The hodgepodge barrage of popular tunes and orchestral score weren't enhancing but distractingly and annoyingly cheaply obvious.  Don't beat me over the head with it!  If they were popups, I would have blocked them. (I actually accessed the setup menu to see if I could block the score.)      In addition, the casting was off.  The love interest model, Eva Fontaine (give me a break--before she became a model?) had no personality.  I wondered why they bothered with her.  The pretty boy brother can't act.  I figure that he was meant to titillate teenage girls.    So many scenes that could have had impact were so poorly executed.  It turned out to be shallow and not so slick.    If you enjoy the hackneyed, cliche, obvious, then buy this movie.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|If you like fractured fairy tales, then you should like The Brothers Grimm.  It's real simple.  If you like Monty Python, and The Holy Grail, or Time Bandits, or Baron Munchausen.  Then you should like this tale of two con men, and how these stories might have come about. <br /> <br />I have read the Grimm fairy tales, and I view this movie as simply a Monty Python twist on the old stories.  If your humor is of the Monty Python sort.  Then you will appreciate this movie.  If you are a fan of Matt Damon, you will appreciate this movie.  If you are a fan of Heath Ledger, and you want to see what he did before Brokeback Mountain you should see this movie.  If you like Time Bandits, or Baron Munchausen.  I don't believe that you will be disappointed.
B000066744|1.0|It takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the Virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service.  And it is two completely wasted hours.  Hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover, the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship, the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship, the bad acting, the farcical piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like Amelia Earhart confused about why she's on a ship instead of her plane. The movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much.  I watched it because of the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso.  He is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables.
B000BM6IQW|5.0|I love this remix album, too bad the US did not get this one, for one, the cover is so much better actually having Britney on it and all. The songs are great, its great for working out, partying and all in all, just a great collection of music remixed, revisited, and reinspired. FIVE STARS all the way!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya never dissapoints, this album is great from top to bottom with at least 4 fantastic songs...absolutely first rate.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie. It was alot darker than the tv series, but it was good in its own way. I also recomend getting the tv series.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I absolutely love Alicia Keys' music and particularly the way she puts her heart into her music.  She is such a talented pianist, as well as singer, and I would buy any CD that she created.  She is so very talented.
006097625X|5.0|This book has really helped me to understand coomics like never before.  I am an artist and I am considering creating and publishing my own comic book, with the help of this book, it will be a whole lot easier to do so.  Because, I now understand not just the mechanics of creating a comic book, but I understand the art of comics as well.   <br /> <br />Thank you.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|If you are familiar with John Mayer's music you most likely LOVE this album because it clearly shows a young artist becoming more comfortable with himself, and in this case, truly finding his voice. If not, you will appreciate the pure and earnest mix of blues and slightly jazzy brand of music heard here. <br /> <br />Mayer seems to be straddling the line between guitar-god-in-the-making and the sensitive singer-songwriter voice of a generation struggling to find its identity. You have to forgive John's obvious Stevie Ray influenced performance here simply because he does it so well. What is plainly obvious on this recording is chemistry and pure music chops. In an age of heavily produced studio music, its so rare to find a live recording like this that has the impact and clarity despite the live setting. Only time will tell how deep the well runs with John Mayer. But this latest offering is a testament to a musician who doesn't mind sharing his personal journey on the  road to discovering just how good he really is. This is the turning point in John Mayer's evolution from young, sensitive pop craftsman to a versatile, substantial and above all honest artist. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000002LPD|4.0|I've read so many reviews of this album and it is passed off by the pro's as below average but saved by the track \\"Right Now\\". I completely disagree with this misconception by the critic elite. Van Halen have more than enough to offer the average fan of rock or hard rock on this platter. \\"Poundcake\\" is a fun rock song about what else? Chicks! a couple of decent album cuts then another top notch track \\"Runaround\\" appears and has an excellent Sammy Hagar strut all through it. Sammy Hagar was not better than David Lee Roth in Van Halen he was different. I think this album is the second best complete album of their career after the brilliant debut and just ahead of the very fine 1984. But this album also contains my personal favorite VH tune of all-time in \\"Top Of The World\\". Again there is filler here and there but the filler is still decent and complimentary to the rest of the album as a whole. If your only a passing fan of VH then this is the album you should own from the Sammy Hagar days. They came off their second weakest album in \\"OU812\\" only eclipsed by the devistatingly weak \\"Fair Warning\\". Two decent songs wrapped up in seven filler tracks of nothing less than abismal filler. You will not be unhappy when the cd is playing in your car nor will need to reach for the skip button as the album plays wonderfully front to back.
0307263118|4.0|Grieving for his dead wife, Anna, the recently widowed - widowered? - art critic Max Mordern returns to the seaside village where he passed the summers of his childhood. He doesn't move into the old family chalet, but rather into a room of the large holiday house once occupied by the wealthy family of his childhood friend, Chloe Grace. There he's supposed to be writing about the artist Bonnard, but instead - or perhaps as well - pens a meditation on the past, exploring the nature of memory and loss... Sounds depressing, but this novel actually made me laugh out loud several times. Banville virgins coming to this direct from the Man Booker winners list might find the absence of a compelling plot off-putting, not to mention the knowingly unreliable narration and the lurking sense that the reader is being elaborately toyed with - especially in the final pages where melodramatic revelations are self-consciously, almost wryly, deployed. It isn't you. It's Banville. As David Mehegan reported recently in the Sydney Sun Herald, most of Banville's novels are like this: relatively thin in terms of plot, scene and dialogue, and virtually all of them are told in the first person by a more or less dislikeable male narrator in an overwrought, lyrical style. His tormented men see everything, and what they see and think unrolls in dazzling verbal pyrotechnics, thick with arcane words and startling metaphors (you'd best keep a dictionary handy). Mehegan quotes other critics as saying that Banville does stretch the reader at times, looking for exactitude and precision, always searching for the mot juste. At its most intense, there is a kind of preciousness in his work. When it's most liberating it reveals the resources of the language and how much is going on in things that look like still life: the light coming in the window, someone sitting in a chair. For some readers, it's not the style that's a problem but the want of traditional novelistic elements. Banville's response to this complaint: \\"I'm not really interested in fiction. I don't regard the novel as a very interesting art form.\\" Asked if that means that his books aren't novels or aren't interesting, he says, \\"If I had the choice of what kind of artist I would be, it would be a composer or a painter, but I have no skill whatsoever.\\" That's perhaps the best way to think of \\"The Sea\\" and most other Banville novels: as something akin to a painting or a piece of music. The thrill isn't in the tale, but in the exquisitely rendered details. It takes some getting used to, but once you know what to expect - once you work out that the artful pomposity is a deliberate function of the character-narrator, and not a failing of the author - then Banville's work is amazing. Lovers of language will adore it. Lovers of plot will be dozing. Lovers of Dan Brown will be furious - which is a nice change, considering they're usually so infuriating.complaint: \\"I'm not really interested in fiction.

0307276902|1.0|This book is greatly disturbing. The five star reviews must becoming from the author, or family members, since no one who has a shred of intelligience would give this book a 5-star. Let me begin by saying that the 5 star reviewers say who cares, if it's true or not, forget the lies. WRONG! The fact is that Frey should be accountable for this and made liable for the fraud he has committed. The fact that he absorbed his character and traveled the country \\"in character\\" for over a couple of years is a matter better addressed by the medical community. The 12 step programs: They're based on HONESTY- a trait he surely lacks. His book has as much to do with recovery as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" has to do with Kansas. Pure Fantasy!  <br /> <br />Besides, to the ones that say \\"Who Cares\\", if it's memoir or fiction, everything aside the fictitious nature of Frey's book is more than just a deception of an audience, it is dangerous. Oprah- should seriously think about choosing this book as her 55 th  pick for her \\"Oprah Book Club\\". His portrayal of recovery as a solitary process is misleading to anyone enslaved by addiction. Oprah, the great humanitarian queen now shares the responsibility of spreading a false message to those in need of help. <br /> <br />Furthermore, if you have a problem with drugs and alcohol, odds are that you will not lick it alone by sheer willpower, as Mr. Frey so romantically (or fictiously now) suggests. Instead, you will need help. <br /> <br />Now, my fellow readers, besides the game of (memoir or fiction), before you diss me, consider reading the book by Eddie Little \\"Another Day in Paradise\\". I did!  Quite the same, ladies and gentlemen. <br /> <br />Forget for  a moment that he lied, he also blatantly ripped off the book tittled \\"Another Day in Paradise\\". How clever, Mr. Frey! Knowing that the writer Eddie had died, so he cleverly stole his book, the characters Lily, guess what, is Rosie in Little's book. <br /> <br />Disturbing, and I'm not fooled!
0307276902|1.0|As shameful as the author's actions of lying in the book and lying on national television are, and of Oprah's too-slow realization that the truth did matter, the real villain in this saga is Nan Talese, the publisher. She sat on Oprah's couch and took no responsibility whatsoever and disavowed any knowledge that the book was a fabrication. I am the owner of Brookview Press, a small, literary press that publishes books in the memoir genre, as well. So I know the process. There is absolutely no way that she could not have known she was publishing a false story. An if she didn't, she is derelict in her duties. A few simple questions asked of the author would have indicated problems. And when they surfaced, some basic fact-checking from the multi-million dollar publishing company's staff should have followed. If we as a small press can do it, Doubleday can't? I believe that they are complicit in the fraud. This book would never have reached bestseller status if it hadn't been billed as a totally true story. <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|Without a doubt, her best yet!  Nora Jones' smokey vocals and stunning lyrics are the marks of an amazing talent.  \\"Don't Know Why\\" is my favorite from the album, with it's soft vocals and beautiful intrumental style.
0316096199|2.0|I bought this book and read it after seeing the high ratings it got.  I was very very disappointed, and like many other reviewers, started skimming and skipping pages just to get through the book.  The beginning was good, her account of the rape was very disturbing (as it should be), but I was expecting this book to be about how she dealt with the rape.  How she went on with day to day life after experiencing such a horrible event.  But it seemed most of the book was about her childhood and what her parents were like, how her mom always had \\"flaps\\" and her sister was sooo perfect, and her dad being the itellectual disconnected father he was.  Where was the recovery?  Besides her having sex with other men and one mention of a woman, there was no telling of the healing, did she have instances where she felt her rapist was watching her?  Were there times she felt alone and scared?  I was never raped (thank goodness), but I was brutally attacked when I was 17 and I can explain in vivid detail the emotions I experienced in the months and years following the attack, I can explain what it took to get over the fact that someone tried to kill me.  But she had none of that in her book.  Like I said, most of it was about her parents, her childhood, friends that she knew and talked to and how they reacted to her rape...although even that wasn't really elaborated on, just a simple \\"he felt uncomfortable around me\\"......and then all of a sudden it was back to the present, it caught me off guard and I had to go back a couple pages to see what and where it changed from the past to the present.  There was no insight into her feelings.  Not even when she saw her rapist on the street, where was the emotion? How did she feel? All she did was explain how she ran home after seeing him, called a friend, talked to her teacher, called the police.  She didn't describe her reaction in depth or how she felt seeing him for the first time since the rape.  And the courtroom part of the book was soooooo unbelievably boring.  I felt I was watching an episode of Law And Order where the defense is badgering the witness.  She never explained how she felt being in the same room with her rapist, never explained how it went with the prosecution.  There was a brief mention of her sweating and crying and I thought \\"wow, here it comes\\" but then nope, it just went back to the boring questioning that really went no where.  Even when they announced he was found guilty, it was just mentioned in one paragraph how the lawyers called her and told her, she called her mom and that was it.  Nothing more, nothing less.......unless I missed all that from the amount of skimming and skipping I did to get through the book.  And then the last part of the book, I thought, okay, now it's getting good again......whoa, when her friend was raped it was just touched upon, it didn't talk about how Alice truly felt, it was just really boring.  I couldn't wait to finish this book. I read all the great reviews of this book and it makes me wonder, Did I read the same book?????
0307276902|3.0|Not that this book needs another's opinion, but for good Christ, people, lighten up! Who cares whether or not certain parts of it are embelished --- did you LIKE the book or not? Frey is not someone so special that the whole of the country should be discussing his life. Take the book for what it is and go on with your life. Unfortunately, the world we live in with Amazon and other online reviews readily available, books are hardly sacred anymore because too many people who have no right to have a say on things all of a sudden have found a forum to make themselves feel important; things in the book world were much better and much more authentic before online reviews were available.
B00008YZYM|5.0|i first saw this movie on an airplane with my dad and during the scene where hallie (annie) is in the car with her dad whom shes seeing for the very first time we both got teary!!! me and my dad were apart when i was young too and it just totally hit home. lindsay lohan was a great little actress even as a child. when i first saw this film i totally thought she was really twins! if she hadnt become famous i would probably still believe that she was twins and be none the wiser! this movie is perfect for people of any age! highly reccomend!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is our 3rd go-round on From Earth to the Moon. We watched it originally on HBO. Having been present at some of the launches and knowing some of the engineers, it was a masterful blend of people and technology. It never erred on being too sunny or glossing over the personal side of things or too technogeek. A few years later we watched it with our teenage daughter who is not science oriented. She loved it, especially Apollo 1 and the Wives Club, which is about the wives of the astronauts- quite a sobering segment. Now we are watching it again with our 10 year old son, who is science oriented, and he is fascinated by it. The series holds up.
B000066AXE|5.0|The movie is not a very accurate biography of Nash's life. Nash's life was very painful according to the book. The movie only touches the outskirts of the pain his schizophrenia caused. The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likeable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have.     The movie is a hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife.     I enjoyed the movie immensely. The movie touches on the nature of reality and our dreams. The DVD extras are good as well. There is an interesting interview with Howard talking to Nash. Pretty cool.
B000002AS3|5.0|Great album!   <br />I believe its the highest selling debut album in British rock history!
0671027387|5.0|I usually don't like reading very much. I'm 15 years old and I read this book last october. I read it in about 4 days, because when I started reading it, I couldn't stop! This novel is very interesting and very detailed, so you actually see the images in your head and you feel the emotions and excitement as if you were there; you totally disconnect from real world.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot, and I recommended it to my friends and they liked it a lot too.<br /><br />The characters have a very specific attitude and if you think, the story isn't that impossible...why couldn't it happen in the real life? See? thing like that are the things that make novels and other books like this very good, entertaining and famous, as well.<br /><br />There's another book that was written by this author, Dan Brown, and it is Angels & Demons. That is a very good book too, but now I just have to talk about this one. You can get this book very confidently, because it'll make you have a very good time.
0446577383|5.0|Most books describing plan to do harm to the President of the United States, the plot line involves a race to save the President. <br /> <br />Without giving too much away be prepared for major surprises. Baldacci's tale of the post-9/11 government is frighteningly efficient, frighteningly mad and frightfully lucky. Civilians and government agents press an investigation where the worst case scenario is much more than the death of one man, even the President. <br /> <br />Start at page one and enjoy the ride, because you won't be able to put it down. <br /> <br />
B0007M22TI|4.0|Awesome music and well done on the recording. Something I will enjoy for years. I love to expose my kids to different types of music and this is a great one for any music library.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I have collected most of Clapton's albums for the past 20 years, and believe \\"Back Home\\" is one his best ever. There is wide diversity in the genre, not just blues which I've come to expect and enjoy, but a mix of reggae, Stevie Wonder influences, and just generally upbeat tunes.  The guitar solo on \\"One Day\\" is awesome, and his tribute to George Harrison is reminiscent of the \\"Layla\\" episode.  Recommended without any reservation.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|I think this is a very boring band, always the same riffs live they sounds like 300 cow without food. If you want to get into system of a down, please don't do it your life will be proved from this commercial s**t. They do in tehir career only one song and they manipulate it for 5 albums...They want to be independent but they are the first who have a contract with a majuor. System of a down is good music? Nothing more false. Don't spend your money for this band, if you like I think you are very underrated. Chek all TOOL works. They can open your eyes forever.
0316172324|5.0|As hard as it has been to think about some of the limits to my attitudes Blink has created a new awareness in me of areas where my judgements have been too quick and based on prejudices. It helped me see areas where I have been influenced and not really thought about how I think. A great read.
0307276902|1.0|I began reading this text several months after Oprah had embraced it on her show, and was at first disgusted at the language and then at the graphic description of events that supposedly happened to the author.  You need a strong stomach to read parts of this book!  Then came the reveal that the author had embellished details of the text.  I haven't opened the book since and probably won't again.  I can overlook vulgar language in a text of this type, and even some of the disgustingly graphic details, but being lied to I cannot overlook. <br /> <br />It should have been the job of the editor to verify the truth of the story being told before promoting and publishing it as non-fiction. <br /> <br />Oprah was duped by this author -- and so were we, his readers.  That, to me, is far more disgusting than vomit and snot crusted clothing.
B0000041ZT|4.0|An excellent rendition of Shostakovich's two jazz suites plus his Piano Concerto #1. However, I've heard Rostropovich conduct all three in person, and would welcome a recording of his, since he was a great friend of Shostakovich's. It hasn't been done, and until it is, this will suffice as a fine addition to any classical library. <br />
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|First time I saw this film, I was sixteen, staying the night at my best friend's house.  We had not smoked anything (except cigarettes) and I remember feeling like I was higher than I've ever been when it was over. A lot of people say that this is strictly a \\"stoner\\" film.  Not so.  Out of the hundreds of times I watched it, I was stoned maybe once or twice.  Sure, it was great those two times, but I got more when I was sober. <br />The thing with The Wall is you have to look BEYOND the visualization to really get it.  For example, the scene that accompanies \\"Empty Spaces\\"(extended), watch that carefully.  You'll see the Wall going up, destroying buildings, churches, and finally stealing innocence.  Going backwards in the movie, the war scenes at the beginning that keep flashing to the stampede/riots at the concert has so many possible meanings it's astounding.  And what about the rampant death that goes with the song \\"The Thin Ice\\"?  The part where Roger is singing \\"Mama loves her baby...\\" and it's showing a young man who couldn't be more than eighteen who was badly injured gave me chills.  That portrayal is all too true for those times.  The only war that had more children fighting in it was the Civil War.   <br />So what is The Wall REALLY about?  The walls we build within ourselves, our facades, our ugliness and beauty, our private pains made public, our betrayals and the horrible things we do to others (and to ourselves).  Sure, the nudity on \\"Young Lust\\" is gratuitous and not what I would expect from Pink Floyd but all the rest of it?  VERY deep.  Dark, yes, a little strange (but what would you expect from them?), yes, but deep and beautiful.  Watch it.  If you're over sixteen and like Pink Floyd.
0694003611|5.0|This book deals with nearly everything in a child's room and house, and page-by-page, it says \\"Goodnight\\" to real items as well as some that had their birth in fairy tales. It says \\"Goodnight\\" to these items, ending with \\"Goodnight noises everywhere.\\"  All of this is from the perspective of a rabbit in bed that children seem to \\"know\\" represents them. I cannot add much to the existing posts, but I think I understand why the mother of 23-month old twins \\"just does not get it.\\" <br /> <br />Twins have a very close sibling to share scary sounds like things that go bump in the night, while most children do not. <br /> <br />This little book is very rugged, so you do not have anything to worry about if your child plays with it.  <br /> <br />I rate this book five stars, and I believe that it will remain popular as long as hardback books survive. The back of the book reads, \\"This classic bedtime story, which has lulled generations of children to sleep, is the perfect first book to share with a child.\\"  That, it is.
0345409671|5.0|Let me say first, that I consider myself to be a born-again Christian.  No, I don't attend services, but I believe in the Bible, in God, and in Christ.  I LOVED this book.  I can overlook some of the more graphic scenes in exchange for the fascinating way that Anne Rice managed to incorporate her own religious journey into the Vampire Chronicles.  I don't believe that Lestat was \\"whiny\\" in this book any more than the other books.  How would anyone else have reacted if they were shown for a fact that God, Satan, Heaven and Hell all exist?  That Jesus truly did walk this Earth and he WAS crucified?    The imagery in this novel is ASTOUNDING.  As always, Anne drew me in to the world through Lestat's eyes.  I saw the Creation, I saw God, I saw Jesus, and it ALL MADE SENSE.  How can a Vampire find redemption and forgiveness?  How can their existence be justified?  I believe that Anne's representation of both God and the Devil are almost completely accurate.  God is a \\"gentleman\\", allowing us to make our mistakes, and weeping when we transgress, while Satan makes following him seem like the most obvious choice.  The fact of the matter is, he is the Father of Lies, and this was represented perfectly.  I don't believe that God is shown to be \\"callous\\" and \\"uncaring\\" as one reviewer here said.  No, not at all.  He was HEARTBROKEN that Lestat would think of going against His will.  Is that uncaring?  I think not.  That's about how God would be, I believe.  This book is amazing.  With grace and precision, Rice takes us into the world as Lestat traverses in this unforgettable journey.  Yes, it's a bit different from the other Vampire novels, but it makes sense that Lestat would be trying to find reason.  He has been through so much already: Claudia, Louis, Akasha, Marius, trading bodies with a mortal, and associating with the Talamasca, not to mention what he saw in the Mayfairs.  It makes sense that this is where his journey would take him.  Read this book with an open mind, expect there to be some changes because of what Lestat has experienced, and just let yourself go into this world that Rice creates.  You won't be disappointed.
B000AY807Q|5.0|the reason to buy the DVD is the hi resolution soundtrack.  So smooooooooth you may wind up not playing the CD again any time soon except in the car. Not that the CD isn't anything short of excellent. It's just that it's a CD. I'm not suggesting you go out and spend your hard-earned dough on one of those over-priced hi-end get-ups. The 24-bit 96 kHz soundtrack on the DVD can be played on any decent DVD player and played through your stereo or home theatre system and it'll sound great.  You can enjoy the music and it'll sound as good as Neil meant it to sound.  Take it from him and go out and get the DVD.    The studio recording sessions are an added bonus!!!!

B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles released albums of widely varying texture and flavor from each other beginning with Revolver.  All of them are great and interesting, but for me Revolver is the most satisfying.  Every song is at least catchy but usually also intriguing.  \\"Love You To,\\" by far George Harrison's most underrated song, is to be found here.  Cataloguing all the songs would be pointless; it's been done better than I could by other reviewers here, and it might even take some of the fun away if you're new to the Beatles. <br /> <br />The key thing, though, is not simply that basic musical literacy requires you to know this album.  It's that basically no one has ever failed to enjoy Revolver.  It will make your life a little happier, which is reason enough to get it.
B00004RJEG|4.0|1999 may have been the year of the Corrs. The group finished a whirlwind world tour, culminating in their famed Lansdowne Road concert in Dublin, sold millions of albums, and became one of the only acts ever to sing in an \\"MTV Unplugged\\" session that was taped for - and aired for - European fans only. However, with the long-awaited US release of the DVD, Americans can enjoy the concert for the first time.<br /><br />Backed by the Irish Film Orchestra and featuring their two road band members, Anto Drennan and Keith Duffy, the Corrs put forth a beautiful show full of their classic hits - 'Only When I Sleep', 'Runaway', 'Dreams', as well as two previously unreleased songs (that would later appear on the \\"In Blue\\" album), 'Radio' and 'At Your Side', as well as covers of favorite hits, such as 'No Frontiers' and 'Old Town'. With most of the tunes performed acoustically, the show was organic, raw, and touching.<br /><br />Why only four stars, then? While the DVD quality is extremely high, with a clear picture and great sound, this disc has absolutely no extras, which is a bit of a letdown. After waiting five years for Region 1 release, I had been hoping for something extra - but it was not meant to be. The show is, however, exquisite, thus the high rating.<br /><br />Looking for a beautiful acoustic show featuring great music, great songs, and an enjoyable ninety minutes? Look no further.

The vocals by Wetton have never sounded as great as this album and Fripp's guitar work on Providence really shows his soloing talent. Every song from the dark Fallen Angel which the lyrics sound like they came from a S.E. Hilton book to the grand finale on Starless this album makes for a great listen.

0307276902|3.0|I see what there was such an investigation into the story because some aspects of it seem unrealistic.
0385334206|3.0|There were three main characters in this book.  The first was Dwayne Hoover.  Dwayne was suffering from a chemical imbalance.  His decent into madness is chronicled throughout the pages of this novel.<br /><br />The second character is Kilgore Trout.  His journey is more literal than Dwayne's.  He travels across the country to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, so as to be the catalyst to Dwayne's ultimate demise.<br /><br />The third character is Kurt Vonnegut himself.  The author in the first three quarters of the book tells the story from the perspective of the narrator, occasionally coming out of that role to tell the reader something about his mother/father/self etc.  In the last quarter or so of the book he enters the story as a character and it's a little bizarre.<br /><br />The story is written as though it's for something not of this planet that doesn't know what tombstones look like or how we reproduce.  It contains many little doodles to act as visual aids.<br /><br />This book is crazy.  The thought process in it is rapid and intelligent.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the ending of this book.  After being given all of the detail-laden-pages that lead to the last ones it felt rushed.  The climax of the story seemed to go by too quickly.  I re-read the last chapters because I thought I missed something but I didn't, it just wasn't there.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I liked this movie better than the first for a couple of reasons. First and for most (SPOILER ALERT)...<br /><br />They kill off his ugly dog faced girlfriend right at the beginning.<br /><br />A couple of other reasons are these:<br /><br />1)Brian Cox is a great actor and is good in everything I have seen him in.<br /><br />2)Joan Allen is also great.<br /><br />3) Julia Styles... not so great. Why the hell she was even in the first one is beyond me. For god sake she stinks as an actress but her part in the first one was almost nonexistent so I can only assume a great majority of her part must have ended up on the cutting room floor, no great loss. But then they bring this schlub of an actress back and expand her part. The only thing that was good about her was when I thought that Jason Bourne might actually be ruthless enough to kill her.<br /><br />The villians in this are also really good.  Damon is pretty good as an actor though his really large head is sometimes distracting but he makes his buddy Bad Actor...er... I mean Affleck look like somebody from you kindergarten play that portrayed a tree cause he couldn't keep his booger eatin' finger out of his nose long enough to speak and chew gum at the same time. But I say, check out Bourne Supremacy. The first one was good. This one was better. If you like fast paced action and intrigue you'll like this one.

B00005JOII|4.0|The same buzz. Woody Allen's new film debuts at Cannes. It is said to be a return to form. It has critic's drooling. It is Hitchcockian. Stop. It is being nominated for numerous awards. STOP!<br /><br />My first reaction - just about the worst title for a film about a tennis teacher. My second reaction, how can you take the strong backbone subplot of (Allen's) \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\", and use it as the singular thrust of a new film? You can't, Mr. Allen. That film left an incredible impression on me and you musn't tamper with it.<br /><br />Not unless you do it quite perfectly. You can hammer it home again. You can make me feel that I haven't returned from a movie theatre but from an art gallery, showcasing a stunning, but depressing new exhibit. After viewing \\"Match Point\\", I'm not strolling along with a renewal of life, wishing for a Manhatten weekend, chuckling to myself, no, I'm dragging a guilty heart for hoping, for even a moment, that the fortunate son-of-a-gun in this film gets away with his crime. I momentarily understood the mindset of an unwilling accomplice. When tragedy befell a character in Allen's \\"Bullets Over Broadway\\", the loss and exit of a hysterically funny performance was felt as if someone had really died. And in \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" all I could think was, ...yes, yes, people are probably like that. Here, the bottom falls out competely. There's no brushing shoulders with those with little regard for human life. We are as insecure as the tennis ball wobbling atop the net, as alike as the trapped rat defending his space.<br /><br />The pretty lipped lead, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is pretty impressive, and Scarlett Johansson, so vital, genuine, and sexual here, proves herself in all sorts of ways. Woody Allen has delivered us a cold slap in the face, and maybe we need to be reminded how badly people can suck. \\"Match Point\\" is a disturbing thud to the heart. I'm in the movieplex lobby, as the real world falls back into place, and the tinge of guilt I feel is complimented only slightly by the sudden rationale realization, that I don't think anything, could have me buy a ticket, and enjoy, a gay Harlequin romance about cowboys.the tinge of guilt I feel is complimented only slightly by the sudden rationale realization, that I don't think anything, could have me buy a ticket, and enjoy, a gay Harlequin romance about cowboys.  <br />
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I have been watching 'Meet Me in St. Louis' since Christmas Eve 1995. and so far I have not skipped watching every year. Happily, from now on, I can make enjoy with a DVD edition. I think this is one of the most masterwork of Vincent Minnelli and Judy Garland. Yes, this is one of the most memorable musical gem too. This movie shows importance of family, relationship of neighbor. I was deeply moved by flow all the way long heart warming mood and I felt touching melody pervaded the in my mind.

0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess rips open our minds, throws in an entire imaginary universe and sews it back together, leaving the universe with us forever in his style-driven novel, \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  <br /> <br />Burgess weaves the English language with Russian slang to create a fictional teenage dialect for our protagonist, Alex and his gang of \\"droogs.\\" These characters shock us with their extracurricular activities of raping women, beating up bums and exploring hallucinogenic drugs at the age of 15.  <br /> <br />The crimes catch up to this villain that we want to hate, but can't. Alex takes the fall for his droogs and receives a 15-year prison sentence. However, Alex's doctors have been working on a case study, \\"Ludovico's Technique.\\" They offer Alex the opportunity to participate in this experiment as an alternative to prison.  <br /> <br />Alex does what any 15 year old would do and takes what seems the less painful choice. Ludovico's Technique is an experiment designed to condition its subject to lose their evil tendencies and become the \\"perfect Christian.\\" This technique comes right out of Psychology 101. Dr. John B. Watson first conducted the experiment with a rat and a child in the \\"Little Albert\\" case study.  <br /> <br />Although Burgess creates a new world, he leaves our imaginations to fill in our own world. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" will have the reader questioning the dangers of conformity, the roles of society and their own existence. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" should be read with an open mind. It took me two weeks to get past the first chapter, but once I did, I never wanted to put it down.
B0000028M7|5.0|If you ask me what my favorite album of the famous \\"Grunge\\" era would be, it would have to be Alice in Chains. But hold on, with all the great music that was released in the 1990's, and think of all the great Hip-Hop, Rock/Grunge, Electronica, and Metal that was released during this era, I rate \\"Dirt\\" the best album of the time. For those that haven't experienced \\"Dirt\\" you can be ready to take the ride of your life. Every single song on this CD is awesome, with no filler material, and fans of all types of music should like this one. Even though I never thought of Alice in Chains to be a metal band, there is a small guest apperance of screaming by Tom Ayera of Slayer. I believe that Alice in Chains sold a lot of records because of they way that they appealed to audiences, and people that liked all types of music could find something to like about this band. Even though Alice in Chains got their share of airplay on MTV and the radio, in no way were they selling out. They were just making music, taken everything from the heart..EX..The rooster was Jerry Cantrell's father and talkes about his experience in Vietnam. If you are a fan of any type of music, this belongs in your collection. ENJOY

B0000024IE|5.0|Most of the younger generation (those born in the 1990's) are probely familer with Flavor Flav with all the TV spotlight he gets on VH-1. Yet back in the Day when Flavor was cracked out, he was with the likes of Chuck D and Terminator X in a very important rap group Public Enemy. This is my favorite PE album of the bunch. They say three times is a charm, and since this was thier third effort, not only did they manage to pull off their best album, but one of the top ten best albums in hip-hop EVER! Almost every song here is a Gem, and for all those that listen to garbage hip-hop (50 Cent, Juvinelle, Little Jon, D-12) then maybe you should use those CD's as coasters or frisbees, and pick up Fear of a Black Planet to hear what REAL Hip-Hop soundsl like. Unfortanltly, the band started to go downhill from here, with two less then steller efforts after this one, and then completely vanishing into thin air. With the return of Flavor outta nowhere being on VH-1's \\"The Surreal Life\\" and 2 other shows on VH-1, it seems like Public Enemy also came back. I have heard some of the newer material, but it just doesn't live up to this. This is a real important piece of hip-hop history, as a matter of fact, MUSIC history. Please Put this one in your collection if you dont have it. ENJOY

Recently, Live and Dangerous was chosen in a popular UK music magazine as the top live album of all time by both critics and the public. For almost thirty years Jailbreak has flown under the radar notwithstanding the incessant play that The Boys... gets on classic rock radio. Anyway, this recording stands the test of time. Terrific guitars and percussion are accompanied by one of the truly memorable voices in the history of rock and roll.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|Up til now my favorite video Napoleonic naval \\"hero\\" was Horatio Hornblower, whether the Gregory Peck movie version or the Ioan Gruffyd TV version.  Role over Mr. Hornblower!  I have not read the Jack Aubrey books on which this movie is based, but I love this movie.  It has so much to commend it.  There are amazing battle sequences, a storm scene that has me checking my living room floor for overflow water, great sadness, great excitement and a host of memorable characters.  Among this host are not only the captain and the ship's doctor, but also the very young midshipman who loses an arm early on in the film, yet surmounts his disability with great dignity and pluck, the older midshipman paralyzed by his own fears, which end up costing two lives, and the ever grumbling Killick, Aubrey's servant, whose running commentary provides some comic relief.  Add to that a great score, full of classical music, and fabulous photography and special effects (especially the effects of canon fire at night and in fog) and what's not to love!<br /><br />In addition to the action scenes and blood and guts, the film explores quiet moments of ship life, from the opening scenes of the sleeping crew, through scenes of the doctor and captain playing string duets to the doctor engaged in his scientific pursuits both on the ship and on the Galapagos Islands.  There is a wealth of detail about shipboard life in the Georgian navy and of the organization of its personnel.<br /><br />The interpersonal conflicts and interactions are believable and memorable.  But probably the most impressive thing about the movie is the study it presents in the choices that may confront a leader in wartime.  From the light-hearted \\"lesser of two weevils\\" moment we are led through several episodes that illustrate the brutal truth that lies behind the joke.  In war the leader must often choose the lesser of two evils:  to sacrifice one life to save the other 196, to punish insubordination even when you don't want to do it for the sake of ship discipline, to sacrifice one's mission in order to possibly save the life of the ship's surgeon who is also your friend.  These moments are uncomfortable and even heart breaking to watch (especially when themed with the music of Vaughan Williams \\"Fantasy on a theme by Thomas Tallis\\") as the viewer is torn between sympathy and revulsion.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one great movie which ought to satisfy both the action lovers and the thinkers.he sake of ship discipline, to sacrifice one's mission in order to possibly save the life of the ship's surgeon who is also your friend.

6305744793|5.0|I must respectfully disagree with the reviewer who disliked the plot. A movie adaptation of a comic or a TV show needs a strong story, and this is a wonderfully strong story: the homecoming of Fester Addams. It illuminates the central Addams theme that, weird though its members may be, this is a close-knit family. It is bold, well made, and clever. Although there are issues of clutter, and one or two unneccessary characters, the basic story is ingenious.
0596009208|5.0|I know only one programming language well, Actionscript. I wanted to know Java, too, to make servlets (and also because Macromedia's many tools seem to be increasingly Java-related).<br /><br />I was skeptical when I flipped through this book because of its goofy diagrams, but I bought it because of its price and the many glowing testimonials in the first pages.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The first half covers syntax, datatypes and objects.

That is, it takes a problem-solving approach, and investigates the wrong turns almost as much as the right ones. This makes learning-by-reading much more like learning-by-doing, which also makes the material stick.<br /><br />There are a few cons: some of the exercises are grating or useless (to my taste); the proofreading isn't that great; the chapter on generics was confusing...but overall, this is probably the best programming book I've read.isn't that great; the chapter on generics was confusing...but overall, this is probably the best programming book I've read.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|My favourite movie for the past 20+ years has been Ladyhawke and I never thought another movie would ever replace it.  Was I wrong.  Phantom of the Opera is the most amazing movie I've ever seen.  I saw the stage version 12 years ago and loved it but the movie is so much better, I think due to the fact that there is so much more that can be portrayed on film as opposed to on the stage.  I only wish I had seen it in the theatre. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler-what can I say except the man is one of the most amazingly talented actors around.  The emotion he portrays in Phantom is heart-wrenching-he made me feel everything he was feeling.  His singing voice is incredible considering he's not a trained singer. I love the rock and roll edge he brings to it. And mercy, he's so handsome and utterly sexy. Perfect in every way. <br /> <br />I thought Emmy Rossum was wonderful.  So much talent for someone so young. I'm sooo envious. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson is also good but I must admit there is NO WAY I would have picked him over Gerard Butler. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Minnie Driver's performance.  She's wonderful as Carlotta and injects humour into her role. <br /> <br />The entire cast, music, settings are everything that is good in a movie. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that it was over way to soon to suit me.  I was totally enthralled.
0307276902|1.0|I love this guy.  He so totally played Oprah and her whorish money making way.  With her facade of concern and feigned empathy, she has played so many people didn't thinking she gives a damn.  Yes, she does good with her Angels Network, but like the cars she gave out, it was not out of her money but rather from that of other companies and charity that made far more back than what they \\"donated\\" in terms of sales revenue and free publicity and media attention. <br /> <br />Oprah is clearly a hypocrit, never reading this author's work, which was clearly so ridiculously off center and preposterous that the only conclusion you could draw was that Oprah is seriously stupid as a piece of dung or simply didn't give a damn and not concern herself with the important details of truth.  At first she kept defending the author and it was clear that she had no real contention with the author when she was on the phone interview with Larry King.  Yet soon after that she got all self-righteous and took her oh-most courageous stance and bravely stood up to lend voice and defend the truth.  Can I get a hallelujah brothers and sisters! <br /> <br />So what happened from that short since her Larry King interview to when she had the author back on her show, now on the proverbial hot-seat?  It's not rocket science people.  Clearly one of her PR people pointed out the obvious that was lost to her, namely that she would have a serious lost of confidence with her audience.  But do not think for one moment that Oprah was now suddenly concerned for \\"truth.\\"  No, this was, as all of Oprah's motives are, a financial move; for in the final cost benefit analysis, Oprah comes on top yet again by feigning the poor \\"duped\\" good samaratin, helping out a poor \\"Joe\\" that made it through a dark time, whose voice can lend yet courage and hope to those who think they have reached their proverbial rope's end.  Break out the tissues, for the emotional string-tugging, took place then and yet again when Oprahmanipulated her audience into sympathizing with her as a \\"victim\\" of this author's scheme.   <br /> <br />Well, I got one thing to say to Ms. Oprah (Harpo spelled backwards by the way): How does it feel to get a bit of the taste of your own medicine that you've been feeding to your audience?  It will take a new generation to see Oprah for the manipulative person that she truly is.  Already the world has gotten a glimpse of it here and there, and this incident highlighted it more in recent times. <br /> <br />I do think however that Oprah feels disgust for the author, for when she sees him, she sees all the lies and facades that she herself broadcasts five days a week reflected back at her. <br />
0895260131|5.0|Informative book that pulls no punches. The author goes through step by step the history of Islam, what is it like living under an Islamic leadership, what dhimmi is, are women really equal in the eyes of Isalamic society. He also investigates if it is true that Islam is tolerant of other religions and were the crusades an agressive action on the part of zealot Christians. The answers to these questions are not what we have been taught to believe.   The author backs up his assertions with quotes from the Koran, from leading Islamic scholars, and from the religion's founder. This book should be read with the Koran, so that verses quoted in this book can be read direct from the Koran to check accuracy and context. Doing so paints an ugly picture of this \\"religion of peace\\". Don't take my word for it try it for yourself. More Americans should educate themselves on this subject and not just believe the hype from CAIR and those on the PC side of things. This book is a good first step.
B0000062FJ|5.0|As most people will attest, Carlos Santana is a true survivor, still relevent after nearly 40 years despite myriad personnel changes, changing tastes and other stuff. Still, the original lineup as seen on this debut and the subsequent \\"Abraxas\\" and \\"Santana III\\" is still the personnel that best defines this band, and the self-titled debut best defines the lineup of Santana, Rolie, Carabello, Brown, Areas and Shrieve. They weren't the only, or even the first, band to combine blues, psychedelic, African and Latin influences, but no question they did it the best. <br /> <br />Why? This is strong stuff; further, you know it's Santana even if you're not familiar with a particular number. Carlos Santana has a distinct guitar style as does Rolie on the B3. And the percussion! Whenever I hear Vicky Sue Robinson sing about how she \\"loves to hear percussion\\" on \\"Turn the Beat Around\\", I always think of Santana and assume she has this record in her collection. Best track for the percussion is \\"Soul Sacrifice\\"; it precedes the other instruments, never lets up and defines the tune throughout. Jose Chepito Areas is a genius. <br /> <br />Lead-off track is the instrumental \\"Waiting\\", a free-form jam that may be a little rough around the edges, but so what. It's followed by the huge hit \\"Evil Ways\\"; no further explanation necessary; just a great tune. \\"Shades of Time\\" also features Rolie's raspy voice, which segues immediately into the hard-charging \\"Savor\\" with its wicked percussion, which then segues nicely to the somewhat quieter \\"Jingo\\", also a radio hit. <br /> <br />Side two is not quite as tight; staring off with \\"Persuasion\\", followed by the catchy \\"Treat\\", which is an easygoing instrumental that according to Rolie was influenced by sax man Eddie Harris' music. Then it's \\"You Just Don't Care\\", which as bluesy and raw as the band ever got. The original album ended with perhaps the number that best defines the band; the aforementioned \\"Soul Sacrifice\\"; which is 6 minutes and37 seconds of musical bliss. Everyone steps up on this one. <br /> <br />Bonus tracks include three selections from the Woodstock concert: \\"Savor\\"; the classic concert version of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" and \\"Fried Neckbones\\" featuring a trumpet solo by Areas. All good. <br /> <br />Woodstock and a subsequent appearance on \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" catapulted this band to superstardom. But this is the album where it all got started. <br /> <br />In the liner notes, Santana calls all the elements of his music \\"the cry\\". It'll be the best cry you ever had. <br /> <br />If you're new to Santana, get the \\"Essential\\" greatest-hits CD. But also get this one, and work from there. <br /> <br />
B0000AMRJC|4.0|The Hour is later than anybody thinks, amigo mio, and Tony Montana stands alone.<br /><br />He is besieged in the black-marble-and-gilt inner sanctum of his rapidly crumbling drug empire, and if you take a look-see over his shoulder at the roughly two-bazillion video security monitors you can see what appears to be the entire population of Bolivia doing the 5-minute-mile through Montana's living room---well, anyway, things don't look so good.<br /><br />But whatever. There stands Tony Montana (Al Pacino, sinking entirely into the skin of what is without a doubt one of the biggest bada**es of movie history), snarling defiance, all enraged animal aggression, snorting a few million bucks of his own Bolivian white and ready to go to war, armed for bear with a fully locked-and-loaded streetsweeper, complete with grenade launcher!<br /><br />And seeing as he has a few unexpected late-night visitors, he's way into Introduction Mode.You know, inviting his gate-crashers to say hello to his Little Friend, and all.<br /><br />You know, the Little Friend with the handy-dandy grenade-clip accessory, for those Close Encounters.<br /><br />How did it all come down to this? How did Montana's burning desire for his own little steaming slice of the American Dream get so, well, messy?<br /><br />Whatever the case, be warned: \\"Scarface\\" attained its cinematic infamy largely because of two unforgettable scenes that just drip with insanity.<br /><br />Boiled down to its guts, \\"Scarface\\" is a flick anchored at one end by a chainsaw in the shower and a heavy-machinegun and a mountain of coke on the other. In the middle we'v got a big, long, endless desert of stylish but lethargic white noise in the middle. And at the end of the day, puzzlingly, \\"Scarface\\" is a major downer.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I love \\"Scarface\\", relish it, probably for all the wrong reasons. I went so far as to get the Deluxe Super-Duper Special Edition all packaged up in a fake gator-skin case with a lining of red velvet, making you want to do a double-take to make sure you didn't leave the silencer attachment to the 9MM FN Browning rolling around inside the box.<br /><br />So now that we've got my \\"Scarface\\" street creds out of the way, let's just face up to facts: Brian De Palma's druglord epic sprawls, sweats ambition, has a lot of really cool \\"chit\\" going for it.<br /><br />It has great, supple acting: Pacino chews up every inch of the landscape as Montana, exuding this raw, furious energy, and bloodlust and drive and this curious, weird, endearing integrity---or maybe even naivete---that helps him ascend, muy rapido, into the counsels of first one drug kingpin (Robert Loggia, playing it down a notch) and then another (the great Paul Shennar, playing it like Ricardo Montalban with a straight-razor tucked up one of his Cerruti-clad wrists).<br /><br />A very young Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira Hancock) is all withering barbs, sultry-bored looks, and coked-up emaciated allure; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina, Tony's sister and one of the many objects of his jealous, crazed attention) is perky and all, but for some reason gives me the creeps---ditto for Wayne Doba (formerly the monster in Tobe Hooper's \\"Funhouse\\") as the weird-as-batsh*t Octavio the Clown. Yech. Was anyone else besides me relieved when that weird, fat little b*stard took a dirt nap?<br /><br />Steven Bauer as Manny is completely believable, and completely doomed. And F. Murray Abraham might very well have opened up one of the final Seals to Armaggedon by merely appearing in this flick as whiney gangster Omar Suarez, tempting ridicule and the Last Days by baring his sparse chest-hair in one of those seventies disco-fever-number silk shirts. Blech. Seeing him doing a hangman's tapdance from a hovering jet ranger was goofy cool.<br /><br />So is \\"Scarface\\" a great movie, one for the ages, worthy of all its hip-hop street creds and gangsta aplomb? I guess it goes two ways: it's a classic for me, and I love itin spite of all its warts. But it does have warts.<br /><br />Now: \\"Scarface\\"has those two unforgettable scenes, a character I can truly dig, a surface theme I happen to agree with (you have to carve out your own destiny in blood, sweat, toil and tears), and a generous slathering of cheesy cool---but I think I know why, ultimately the flick rubs me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think Brian De Palma wanted to make a morality play about how having it all, having all the money in the world, really being able to wallow in the truth of \\"The World is Yours\\"---well, Esse, at the end of the day it ain't all that. He tries to do with Tony Montana---who I want to see win, and so do you, stop lying---what Oliver Stone did with Gordon Gekko in \\"Wall Street\\".<br /><br />That's why \\"Scarface\\" feels off, somehow: the flick zags when, dammit, you want it to zig. It's right, it makes sense, that Montana would whack Castro's toady Rebenga and then brag to Loggia about it being fun; it's right that Montana takes a no bullsh*t approach and drives his way right into druglord Alejandro Sosa's heart of darkness.<br /><br />It's right, it's in character, that Montana, in the grip of utter contempt, puts down his former mentor Frank Lopez (Loggia) like a sick, fat, egg-s*cking dog.<br /><br />But come on: would the Montana we know and love every really agonize over sending a couple of squawling brats, ultimately executing the assassin with extreme prejudice and sealing his own fate? Would he really take lip from his mealy-mouthed, money-laundering banker, or would he introduce the interfering little c*bron to his Little Friend? Would he really get all henpecked by Elvira, finally dissolving into a puddle of drug-addled futility? Would he really blast long-time amigo Manny for getting jiggy with Gina?<br /><br />Of course not. But it's a morality tale: what profit it a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?, and all.<br /><br />So yeah, we've got a big bottle of Crystal, but the grapes are rotten; we've got a silver tin of caviar, but it's been out in the sun for a week; we've got a Rolls Royce Phantom with a V4 engine. So Tony Montana slouches down into the bubbles of his marble soaking tub, snapping at Manny and Elvira and pretty much anyone who comes into periscope range, with that livid look snarls \\"is that all there is?\\"<br /><br />Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe the real lesson of \\"Scarface\\" is this: if you're gonna doublecross a brutal Bolivian drug-lord and his army of whacked-out M16 wielding zombies, you'd better spend a little of that fortune hiring some muscle besides Chi-Chi and Nick the Pig.<br /><br />Or maybe it's more like this: what profit it a man to gain the whole world if he doesn't have any damned fun afterwards?<br /><br />JSGscenes, a character I can truly dig, a surface theme I happen to agree with (you have to carve out your own destiny in blood, sweat, toil and tears), and a generous slathering of cheesy cool---but I think I know why, ultimately the flick rubs me the wrong way.

B00005JOFO|5.0|For such an intensely spare film, I would like to spend only the necessary words: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a great virile love story, beautifully rugged and limpid, destined to become a classic.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is NO JOKE- John Cleese's BEST stuff is in these episodes! He's an eccentric hotel owner who just doesnt like customers- it's hilarious! Its not just good all-round humor, but the physical aspects and just the antics of John are HILARIOUS!!!! He and his then wife Connie Booth wrote the series, and it's great!<br /><br />The DVD's are worth it because the bonus features are good (not great) with some interesting interviews and it has subtitles for the episodes in case you can't quite understand the english. :)
B00006GFAB|1.0|It's tragic that a group like this became as highly popular and successful as it did, considering that Kiss was a band that really could do nothing, musically speaking. Their live \\"act\\"-or whatever it was-was something that belonged in a circus or perhaps in a Las Vegas hotel, rather than in the real musical world. In fact, I remember some kids in school who were huge fans of this abomination, and they all seemed to be in true need of psychological help. And to hear Gene Simmons, who sounds more like a Jewish accountant  than a musician, which he barely is to begin with, go on the Howard Stern show and take credit for virtually everything and anything in music makes he and his band all the more absurd. He even claimed that Kiss were better than the Who live. Excuse me? In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear him claim that Kiss invented the Who. And he should keep the makeup on all the time-he looks better with it on than without it.
B00003CXCT|3.0|In December of 2005, in conjunction with the release of \\"King Kong,\\" Peter Jackson released a two-disc DVD set on nothing but the film's production. Over three and a half hours of behind the scenes footage was presented, chronicling everything from set design to special effects and everything in between. Packaged with the discs were four production art prints and a fifty-two page booklet, which contained many on- and off-set photos. <br /> <br />Wow. A two-disc set of production footage. This alone is proof that Jackson is a director who knows how to cater to his fans. <br /> <br />George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Peter Jackson. For his \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" DVD boxed set, Lucas apparently decided against going the extra mile in terms of special features. This is a real shame, not only because they're such classic films, but also because this is their first release on the DVD format.  <br /> <br />Nearly everything about this disappointing set is minimalist. Each film is given only one disc without any special features; all of those are reserved for a fourth disc, one that really doesn't go very far. The best we're given is a two and a half hour documentary on all three films, entitled \\"Empire of Dreams.\\" Two and a half hours may seem like a decent length of time, but because it covers the entire trilogy, it was forced to simplify each of the films' productions into general, nonspecific analyses. It would have been better to devote a two and a half hour documentary to each film individually. Everything would be much more in depth and satisfying. <br /> <br />Of course, there are a host of other special features that were neglected. For one, only a handful of the Trilogy's many trailers were included. Furthermore, virtually no artwork is presented, and promotional material is sparse at best. Storyboards and test footage are nowhere to be found. (Wouldn't watching the original animatics be awesome, especially for the battle scenes?) And what about deleted scenes? Any \\"Star Wars\\" fan knows of Luke's conversation with Biggs on Tatooine in the first film or of the moment when C-3PO tears away the \\"Do Not Enter\\" sticker from a door in the second film. Shouldn't we be allowed to view these moments in digital clarity? It's a side of \\"Star Wars\\" history that so few have had the chance to see. <br /> <br />One of the biggest issues surrounding this set is the fact that only the digitally enhanced Special Edition versions are included (which, interestingly, have had more reworking since 1997). Lucas has remained quite adamant about this, claiming that the Special Editions represent what he wanted to see in the films originally. He's also said that the original versions will never again be released. As we all know, many fans are outraged about this; for them, only the unaltered Original Release versions are acceptable. I, for one, don't have a problem with the Special Editions. They are what they are, and in my opinion, they work just as well as the Original Releases. That being said, I still feel that Lucas was a fool to not release the original versions. He may not agree with the way the films were presented back in 1977, 1980, and 1983, but they are still a part of cinematic history. Denying them release is akin to denying the past. <br /> <br />I'm sure Lucas will never change his mind about this. But in the off chance he opens to suggestions, then mine would be to include BOTH versions of the films on the same set. That way, everyone comes away happy: Lucas gets his Special Editions released and fans are finally allowed to choose which version they'd prefer to see. Many DVD sets offer this option, anyway (such as the \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" set, another great example of catering to fans). It's puzzling why Lucas would be so blind to such a win/win scenario.   <br /> <br />Imagine someone trying to fill an empty swimming pool with a mere glassful of water. That's the way I see the \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" DVD set. I suppose it would be fine for those who prefer DVDs without bonus material (and some do). But for the rest (and the majority) of us, this is not enough. I want to know everything about these incredible films, all the ins and outs, all the highs and lows. I want to see the details and hear the ideas that went into each film, even the ones that were rejected or changed. I want to see photos of set construction and footage of original interviews from the 1970s and '80s. I want to watch all the screen tests. I'd like to be able to read the first drafts of the scripts. I want to see model construction and hear some explanations as to their design.  <br /> <br />In short, I want more. <br /> <br />If I were to describe the ideal DVD set for the \\"Star Wars\\" saga, it would be one that included all six films. Each would be given two discs, and they would all be packed with the special features I mentioned earlier, plus many more that I didn't mention. Episodes IV, V, and VI would have both the Original Release versions and the Special Edition versions available (as I said before). I'd probably include a booklet of some kind, something detailed and probing that wouldn't disappoint fans. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I have no control over the format of the \\"Star Wars\\" DVDs. For now, I have to stick with what was offered. I can only hope that future releases will do a better job of presenting what the fans want to see. Mr. Lucas, you're going to have to try a little harder if you really want to impress us. Give us something that is truly a collector's item instead of a bare bones gathering of three movies. These films redefined the meaning of the word \\"blockbuster,\\" and it's time they get recognized for that. A good start would be a decent DVD set.

B000002UB3|5.0|This album should be in every home throughout the world, yes indeed. This album expresses the era to the tee, somewhat the same manner as Sgt. Pepper's, but lets remember one thing, this one isn't a concept, but still a true gem. Even though attacking his personal manners and habbits, Lennon's Come Together, for one for all. Something is probally the most reconized song of the Beatles, and funny enough not written by Lennon-McCartney, but by our quiet one, George Harrison. Next we go to a comical Maxwell's Silver Hammer, very cleverly written by Paul, almost like Manson taking notes. Oh Darling, another Paul song, almost like having a seizure with the screaming and the mercy to even a lonely soul with putty in his hands for a gal. Now we got Ringo's swan song Octopus's Garden, almost like a trip back to memory lane with Yellow Submarine, except with no cartoon, and this one was written by him. Now even though this song actually only has three sentences repeated over and over again, you can't loose with Lennon and Harrison's guitars playing on this very aggressive track written by Lennon, I Want You, love it. Harrison comes back with Here Comes The Sun, acoustically fit for any moment in time to keep you smilling. This one always gives me goosebumps when it's played, Because, almost good enough to be sung in any chapel accross the world, or even chanted by monks in their code of silence. You Never Give Me Your Money, probally a far cry from the truth as far as the Beatles are concern, they got all the riches in the world, and that's not including the money (you figure it out). The next few songs are put together in a collasal like they were meant to be together in harmony, Sun King, partially sung in a different tongue, Mean Mr. Mustard, sleeping in park shade, Polythene Pam, so good looking, another Lennon number, both written during their time in India. She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, written by Paul, and suppose to have been on the slot for the Get Back (Let It Be) session. Now you got the finale, almost making you want to sigh with Golden Slumbers, the very British sounding, Ringo overwelming but cleverly sung Carry That Weight, and finally from this set The End, almost like it wasn't even played in this time frame, but like it was played during the mid 70's fom a arena band, making stardom with their multi-million seller album, but it's our four lads playing their hearts contempt, and closing an end to a beautiful band known as The Beatles, and also an end of an era. SIKE!!! Almost, Paul comes back with Her Majesty for a few seconds, just to leave you stunned. This album will always have an ache in my heart knowing this was their last with Lennon (physically). But lets reflect a little, he made this band, and the rest was elements stir together, Paul, George, and Ringo (something that was definitely needed for sucess), a true friendship shattered in the end, or was it. I truly believe in each of their hearts even after this album they loved each other (like brothers, soulmates). They will always be my favorite band of all time, and they will always have a place in all Beatles Fans hearts.
0780020693|5.0|Federico Fellini's satiric yet lovingly nostalgic look back at his youth and home town (Rimini, Italy) just before the war. Viewed through the eyes of a teenaged youth (played by Bruno Zanin), we see all the crazies in this seaside town: his ever-fighting parents, the town floozy, the lecherous priest, his school, etc. Crudely humorous one moment (Zanin and his buddies are obsessed with female anatomy) and drippingly sentimental the next, the movie is a potpourri of half-forgotten, half-imagined memories: it is truth filtered through the screen of time and imagination. Fellini has given us a lot here to marvel at. A wonderful movie.
B00006FM77|4.0|not very good recording quality. that fourth CD truly makes the box set worth the money. that version of 25 or g to 4 is much better than the originally released live version. terry kath's solo is just balls to the wall nuts. you can hear his influence on countless guitar players now. The horns (which has been said before) don't sound stellar but being a trumpet player for almost 5 years I don't care and neither should the average buyer. Danny Seraphine and Peter Cetera just groove. Walt Parazaider, Lee Loughnane, and the amazing Jimmy Pankow may not sound good but you need to remember it is Carnegie Hall. As a side note when the beatles played their the recordings they had were unsalvageable because the crowd over powered the tunes so just remember that. But if you're looking for a comprehensive Chicago early days set with awesome improv solos this is it. The posters and booklet were all shrank down and all look awesome. It's well worth the price that amazon charges just to hear the unemulatable terry kath play his solos. Truly underrated guitar player he was. BUY NOW!
B00000IMTF|4.0|Originally released in 1976, this is the follow-up to their debut 'Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow' album (see my review). Didn't realize it until now, but this second effort brought in keyboardist Tony Carey, bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Cozy Powell (R.I.P.) to the band's line-up, joining Blackmore and vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Best tunes here include \\"Tarot Woman\\", the classic \\"Stargazer\\" (some might think it's title is \\"Where Is Your Soul?\\") and \\"A Light In The Black\\". Notice the playing here is really good. I've heard several patrons compare 'Rising' to that of classic Deep Purple.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At the risk of sounding cliche, I will start by saying that I consider most television programs to be of excrement 'quality'. Once in a while comes a show that makes it worthwhile to have purchased a box and justifies spending precious minutes staring at moving images. 'Firefly' is one such program. The setting, while not completely new, is very interesting (think post civil war America transferred into space). Characters are treated with depth and always show new facets of their persona. Plots are a very unique mix of western movies and space operas, which will probably please fans of both 'genres'. The fact that the show was cancelled is a testimony to the fact that television programs do not last due to their quality but rather live or die by the whim of managers for whom money is the ONLY bottom line. Buy this show and enjoy every second of it, then go online and participate in the effort to revive it.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Originally released in 1978, this was Rainbow's third studio lp and final work with vocalist Ronnie James Dio. In my humble opinion, 'Long Live Rock & Roll' was the best of the band's first three albums. Two new members are present here, keyboardist David Stone and bassist Bob Daisley. This effort was produced by Martin Birch, like the first two and 'Onstage', the live offering. Killer tracks here, that I can never get enough of are the title cut \\"Long Live Rock & Roll\\", \\"L. A. Connection\\", the powerfully done \\"Kill The King\\", \\"The Shed (Subtle)\\" and the intricately played ballad \\"Rainbow Eyes\\". A truly outstanding '70's heavy rock classic pick, and an absolute must-have.

B000068CNX|5.0|I have watched this season so many times I have literally memorized every plot..every guest star..practically every line! All the episodes are hilarious but these are my favorites: TOW Ross' New Girlfriend, TOW Ross Finds Out, TOW the List, TOW the Prom Video, TOW Ross and Rachel...You Know, and TOW Joey Moves Out. The second season of Friends started the monumental relationship of Rachel and Ross which goes on and off more than a lightswitch throughout the entire series. Also Tom Selleck who plays Monica's much older boyfriend, Richard is a spectacular guest star. The second season starts with Ross returning from China, new girlfriend, Julie attatched snugly to his shoulder, and ends with Ross and Rachel together, Monica and Richard in a tragic breakup due to his reluctancy to have children. Many plot twists and turns make for an interesting season that I have enjoyed for a very long time and I'm sure I still will!
B000002U82|5.0|DSOTM IS THE GREATEST MUSICAL ALBUM EVER DUE TO SONGS LIKE TIME AND MONEY.RECOMMENDED
B000BOH8XW|3.0|From a purely artistic standpoint, I'd have to give this album a FIVE star rating.  It is very creative, very well produced, and (as usual) very well performed.  So why overall do I only give it THREE stars?  Because, sadly, it seems to be missing that \\"fun factor\\" that makes you want to listen to it over and over again!  Riding around with it in my car for the last two months, I find that after listening all the way through, it gets yanked in favor of something else.  Unlike Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1, this album just hasn't grown on me.  While DON'T BOTHER is a good single, it doesn't have the grabbing power of earlier Shakira tracks like WHENEVER, WHEREVER (SUERTE); CIEGA, SORDOMUDA; OJOS ASI; ESTOY AQUI, or even NO from FO#1, that make you keep listening to the WHOLE album until you've got it memorized.  I'd say that O.F. Vol 2. is just a bit too melancholic and moody for my tastes.  Definitely NOT a \\"pick-me-up\\" album.  Again, artistically, it's well conceived and executed, but if you want an \\"Exuberant Shakira Fun Fiesta\\", I'd go with DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES or LAUNDRY SERVICE.  F.O. Vol 1, while equally artistic as O.F. Vol. 2, is also cheerier in tone and, unlike the Amazon \\"official\\" reviewer, I'd give DIA ESPECIAL a much higher rating as a song than its' English translation available on O.F. Vol. 2.  So, in conclusion, if you want \\"artsy\\", then you'll LOVE this album.  If you're READY FOR THE GOOD TIMES and want fun, pick ANOTHER Shakira album to enjoy!  As for Shakira's NEXT album, I'm hoping for MORE FUN, LESS ART!!!!
B0002DB50E|5.0|Cronenberg at the top of his game.  An amazing director, that all the world will hail a genius when he is gone.  Why wait, I am telling you now, check this out.  This film is really impressive when you consider what Cronenberg was doing with special effects in 1983!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Fabulous movie.  Animation was phenomenal.  What a wonderful story.  I used to read the book to my children when they were young.
1565117700|3.0|This was disappointing because although Gary Sinise does a good job read the book, the sound quality is bad.
B000002KON|5.0|I remember getting this album when it came out...what was it, 1969 or 1970?... and being awestruck. 35+ years later it's just as impressive. How this album and several of the individual tracks have escaped fame is beyond me. Victoria, Australia, Shangri-La, Some Mother's Son, Driving all should have been top 10 singles. For me it's one of the top 5 rock albums of all time along with Abbey Road, Blind Faith, Morrison Hotel,and Low Spark of High Heeled Boys.
B000002UAR|5.0|Before I write my review let me first make an observation I've noticed of other reviews here: That Beatles fans have hyped this too far and that Beatle detracters have bashed it for the wrong reason. I don't like the fact that this album is bashed for being a \\"RELIC.\\" I guess we should blame the Beatles for being born in a more distant decade or realize that that is an idiotic criticism. The other thing I hate are the incorrect comparisons. Everyone agrees that the first major concept album, whether fully conceptual or not, is Sgt. Pepper's NOT Tommy. Another thing, what is with the new ANTIBEATLE schtick? Do you guys belong to some evil cult or something? They were the best at what they did and the most popular while doing it. That's right, they were better then any of the obscure bands you can name. Don't name an unknown band and try to act like a high-brow critic; its pathetic! Another group that must be addressed: the fans. You guys need to stop it! This album is great, but don't call it the best cause that is impossible to distinguish the best album they ever made. Just try to be fair about it. Is this the best Beatle album there is? That's a personal thing. No one can tell you what you will like. I think that this is the most inclusive album with nice easy McCartney tunes to reel in new Beatle fans and psychedelic masterpieces for the veterans. All in all, a good mix. So now to the people I'm truly concerned with: you, that adventurous spirit that has decided to try this band for the first time and wondering what you should get. Personally I think this, Rubber Soul, and Abbey Road are perfect for beginners. You won't be bogged down by the more psychedlic stuff, but will be slowly introduced and that's always the best way to do things. (Best songs on this album In My Opinion are: Got to Get You Into My Life, Elenor Rigby, Taxman, I'm Only Sleeping. Be wary of Dr. Robert and Yellow Submarine!)
B000063V8S|5.0|The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not... <br /> <br />$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?) <br /> <br />Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the entire series IS fun... but season 4 sees the loss of the inimitable Ron Jones; who was sacked because the production team wanted to alter the series' format to more soapy drama, less action/adventure and much less sci-fi concepts being used.  (big mistakes, IMHO) <br /> <br />best of Both Worlds II:  The end cure-all is cheezy, but it works. <br /> <br />Family:  The first of 4 stories to have the same plot: Character survives a nasty situation and has to feeeeeeeeeel the repercussions.  It got trite quickly.  This one makes sense; it's Picard visiting home and has to deal with the Borg assaulting him.  Yes Virginia, men can be raped too. <br /> <br />Brothers:  Data has a homing device and reprograms the ship to go to a strange planet.  Of course, this is the ONE TIME that Crusher can't heal a sick patient so the ship has to get to Starbase 269 or whereever...  Of course, they get there and we meet Data's creator.  Of course, Lore picked up the signal too...  Kudos to Brent Spiner for handling THREE roles with aplomb.  In the right mood, this one is highly enjoyable, but the daft sick-kid diversion is nothing more than a diversion and is a bit of a copout. <br /> <br />Suddenly Human:  The worst of the bunch.  A kid raised by a race of aliens (that look like wolves) is being sent back to his biological human parents, not realizing thatyears of existing upbringing cannot be undone...  Just think if Picard was a Borg for 17 years and then undone... Holy Hugh...  garbage, this story is. <br /> <br />Remember Me:  It's Crusher's turn to lose her world only to get it all back at the end, being saved by the Traveller.  It's an interesting take on the show's science (living in a warp bubble), but it all feels empty once she's saved; little better than a dream sequence routine. <br /> <br />Legacy (#80):  WOW.  Made solely as homage to passing TOS' number of episodes (79), this one is a terrific action-packed piece.  Tasha's sister and association only sweetens the pot...  there's little to dislike here, except an obvious re-use of sets from Best of Both Worlds - a story that is hardly forgettable. <br /> <br />Reunion:  Worf subplot continues... <br /> <br />Future Imperfect:  Not a bad story; Minuete returns unexpectedly (which was way-cool), but it's revealed that the latest candy bar winner of the year is why it was made at all.   <br /> <br />Final Mission:  Wesley's swansong is a bit dull.  A shame; Wesley matured in season 3, and Wil Wheaton deserved better (great actor, not a good character written for him, though. :(  ) <br /> <br />The Loss:  It has a ring of realism to it, but unless you enjoy Troi moaning and whining all the time, there's little of interest here.  Except for a new science concept to be re-used next season. <br /> <br />Data's Day:  A weird one, ending with a slap in Picard's face thanks to a Romulan spy... <br /> <br />The Wounded:  A vehicle for O'brien and a new race known as the Cardassians.  (uh-oh:  new species invented.  They're struggling for new ideas and parallels to Earth societies already...) <br /> <br />Devil's Due:  Another 70s-revival story dug from the grave, it's fun but it's obvious the story was meant for Kirk.  (why not have Riker be the object of Ardara's interest instead of Picard?!  Just like how every other woman of the week was for Riker during seasons 1 and 2...) <br /> <br />Clues:  Namby pamby by the end; but the ideas are nice enough. <br /> <br />First Contact: Don't confuse this with the fan-centric movie from 1996; this one is rich, deep, and brilliant in its use of showing one's self to new cultures.  Riker isthe perfect character to use as the injured party - and there's a woman of the week for him too!  :D <br /> <br />Galaxy's Child:  AWESOME follow-up made in Booby Trap.  Pity Dr Brahams didn't return.  She and Geordi (as characters and as the actors playing them) have an obvious chemistry together and it's wonderfully played out. <br /> <br />Night Terrors:  Empty horror-wannabe. <br /> <br />Identity Crisis:  I don't recall the plot, so it can't be very memorable... <br /> <br />The Nth Degree:  Barclay returns; and seems a dream-come-true for anyone like Barclay:  To become normal and then better.  Lovely stuff. <br /> <br />QPid:  I love this one; Q chides Picard over obvious affection for Vash (introduced in Captain's Holiday).  Q and Vash make the perfect couple and the perfect foils for Picard to boot.  And Worf hates being a merry man!  ROFL <br /> <br />The Drumhead:  Preachy beyond belief, yet noble in its cause regarding keeping an open mind and not drawing quick conclusions. <br /> <br />Half a Life:  Controversial, but not preachy, this story regarding a set \\"death date\\" is intelligently done on the whole. <br /> <br />The Host:  Another species is introduced, the Trills.  Forgettable and another species being introduced means they're clutching at more straws for future ideas (few of which get used until DS9...) <br /> <br />The Mind's Eye:  AWESOME, if not predictable, tale of Geordi being kidnapped and brainwashed by the Romulans. <br /> <br />Redemption:  Part 1 is actually very good, continuing the Worf subplot and revealing somebody we'd never expect:  Tasha Yar! <br /> <br />All in all, season 4 ends the best that TNG had to offer, though later seasons still had some merit...
B000002UAO|5.0|If you have to steal this album I would recommend it, not for all the album's sake, but for one song: In My Life. This is the most beautiful thing the Beatles ever wrote and they themselves admit that this was one if not THE best song they ever concieved. Not only that, but the entire album elevates this to a level that will never again be reached. The Word is a fabulous little hippy anthem, Nowhere Man is graceful, yet powerful in its message, Drive My Car opens you up to more, and Michelle always makes an impression. My personal favorite and I'm sure it will grow on you to. For new listeners I recommend sticking to some of the easier tracks like 1 and 11. Norwegian Wood and others are amazing, but hard for some newcomers to digest for the first time.
B000063V8T|3.0|The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not... <br /> <br />$50 per season is on par and is a good price.  (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?) <br /> <br />Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end. <br /> <br />Season 5 really hits home with its depletion of cool sci-fi concepts, in lieu of more drivel drama, preachy society-parallels, and stereotypes. And technobabble to make everybody think the show is sci-fi anyway. And then there's the music.  Interesting music scores are replaced by what sounds like near-identical stock music for every single episode!!!  It grated very quickly and did NOTHING to help the quality of ANY of the stories...  it's dated badly too. <br /> <br />Redemption II:  Data seems to react very angrily toward prejudice aimed at him... and by 1992, making a 2D tachyon web is asinine when the Romulans can see the thing - and conceivable use WARP DRIVE AND GO AROUND IT IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid. <br /> <br />Darmok:  Ignore that the alien language is just a mucked-up Yodafied English and the premise is noble. <br /> <br />Ensign Ro:  The producers finally figure it out that some friction on the Enterprise may be a good thing after all.  But the subplot is about as trite as anything they could find; occuptation of a malignant enemy.  Ro is a Bajoran and her enemy are the Cardassians...  Ro has potential... <br /> <br />Silicon Avatar:  Let's shatter the crystal for good; complete with huge tear-shedding subplot over the mother of a victim of the Silicon Entity that Lore used to destroy the Omicron colony...  (Datalore)  She transposes Lore for Data and just doesn't seem to get it.  And while the story is uber-preachy and far-fetched in its bubble-like dreamland, her decision to destroy the wretched crystal was the correct one. <br /> <br />Disaster:  More scientific inaccuracies and lamentable drivel-laden dialogue make this a disaster.  Movin' on.  (Ds9 has a similarly themed story too...) <br /> <br />The Game:  Wesley's first reappearance is well handled.  A stock \\"Wesley saves the day because Riker got it on with an alien babe of the week\\" plot, it's well handled - and a better anti-drug message to boot.  (they seem to do better when they DON'T try.) <br /> <br />Unification:  Part 1 is overly long; part 2 is the entertaining part.  Especially with \\"cowboy diplomacy\\" that made it clear Berman and his production team were never keen on Kirk's era.  (so why they had to bring back Kirk-era aliens, ideas, and crewmembers to bring in ratings remains a mystery...  well, not really...) <br /> <br />A Matter of Time:  Matt Frewer hams it up in a half-decent use of time travel.  Unfortunately, the gibber about CO2 is as ridiculous as it gets... and it's a core element to the story.  Ugh. <br /> <br />New Ground:  Worf subplot continues, though at this point it probably shouldn't have. <br /> <br />Hero Worship:  Candy bar winner of the year, come on down and pretend to be like Data! <br /> <br />Violations:  A GREAT story; the second I can properly recommend, apart from The Game.  Very well done.  Even the music isn't as annoying as it should be. <br /> <br />The Masterpiece Society:  Uberpreachy and ridiculous to the core; sometimes people HAVE to change in order to survive.  It seems our oh-so-noble Picard would rather have let the people die, saying \\"Waaah, we shouldn't have broken the prime directive\\"?!  What a steaming pile this waste of celluloid is. <br /> <br />Conundrum:  Well, it tries.  An alien manipulates the Enterprise crew in an attempt to wipe out an enemy.  (with mental powers so great, why involve anyone else at all?) <br /> <br />Power Play:  Bad music hampers what is actually a decent action-based plot, particularly given the low nature of season 5; incorporeal aliens taking over bodies as they desire escape from a situation they're trapped in. <br /> <br />Ethics:  UGH!  As usual, when logic and the reality of risk-taking doesn't work, make stupid adjustments and contrivances to have it your way because your point of view is so much better, no thought is allowed...  Apparently, Worf has two brains too.  :rolleyes: <br /> <br />The Outcast Society:  Hmmm, the \\"bold\\" attempt at a pro-GLBT story has a bunch of sexless nitwits wanting to act like... HETEROSEXUALS?!  Even Jonathan Frakes has said he'd have preferred the androgynous person being \\"male\\" instead of \\"female\\".  (right on!!)  As usual, TNG does it best when they don't try to make social parallels:  Picard in \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" gets it right when saying \\"If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.\\"  Besides, Berman never realized that Trek was about the human condition.  Not being preachy to an audience that obviously can't handle the topic as they had to go so far out of their way to make the topic as shrouded in as much abject doublespeak inanity as possible.   <br /> <br />Cause and Effect:  Another time travel type plot, this one takes us inside the bottle.  A+++ for perspective.  C- for being repetitive; it is not enough material for 44 minutes; most of us had figured it out by act 2 anyway. <br /> <br />The First Duty:  Another moral piece; but Wesley is true to form.  I have a soft spot for it, however. <br /> <br />Cost of Living:  I dunno if I should laugh or cry...  Lwaxana introduced Alexander to the wild side of life and Worf thinks that she's got no business in dealing with Alexander.  Whatever, I may as well tune into a 2PM soap opera and get the same drivel... <br /> <br />The Perfect Mate:  I don't recall it, except it's got a loveinterest for Picard that wasn't to be his...  somewhat fun as I recall... <br /> <br />Imaginary Friend:  Another candy bar promotion winner?  Either way, this one is fun and I don't know why.  Others may or may not.  Kids will love it, regardless. <br /> <br />I, Borg:  Oh good.  Have even Guinan shed a tear for these Borg monsters... the net result of which being a bigger embarrassment, but that's next season...  \\"Vendetta\\" (the non-canon book) did a great job at continuing the Borg saga.  But I, Borg onward... puerile preachy garbage. <br /> <br />The Next Phase:  Sci-fi concepts, action, Romulan trechary?  yeah, there are some science logic gaffes but they're easy to ignore because this one is such a breath of fresh air!  The Geordi/Ro interaction is terrific too.  Highly underrated! <br /> <br />The Inner Light:  Overrated; I never saw what's so great about this...  of course, if it's the life Picard wanted to have instead then I can see the merit... it's just not my thing. <br /> <br />Time's Arrow:  I don't remember this one; except thinking it was all uneventful and uninspired. <br /> <br />All in all, the show has clearly gone downhill; but a few gems still remain.  Does the trend continue?  And will it turn around?
0380799006|5.0|I just read this book and have put it on my husbands nightstand to read (that way we are both on the same page).  It took me about 3 days to read (I have 2 small children so reading is a nightime ocurrance) and I have already implemented quite a few strategies.  My husband has taken my lead and even though he hasn't read the book he too has used some of the ideas.  The results have been great.  Our kids (3 and 8) are pretty good together and in that area we are blessed but there are moments that the ideas in this book have been great diffusers.  Just acknowleging the boys and their feelings has stopped situations from escalating and it allows us to stay out of the discussion and stay impartial.  The biggest thing for me is...I have learned to pause before responding because I want to think about the impact of what I want to say and how it may affect my child.  Just reading the book and seeing the childs point of view and that of the other participants in the book has given me such a greater understanding of how my words can stay with my child for a lifetime.

Wesley starting the problem is a big boost too. <br /> <br />The Ensigns of Command:  Another home-run with this entry of Picard having his hands full; fighting a stolid species of inflexible corporate bugs while finding means to persuade a bunch of colonists to vacate the planet that the inflexible corporate bugs claim ownership too.  Very good story indeed! <br /> <br />The Survivors:  An oddball, but highly enjoyable and well cast.  Especially if you've never been keen on Troi. <br /> <br />Who Watches the Watchers:  Badly dated and preachy, but it's got enough set pieces to remain worthy. <br /> <br />The Bonding:  I think, as with When the Bough Breaks, this one features kids on it as a result of a candy bar write-in contest...  It's a bit soapy, and why the alien wants to cajole one little kid seems silly... <br /> <br />Booby Trap:  Shades of season 2, but this one is back on form with good ideas; especially with seeding an idea to be followed up next season.  Though, in reality, the ship caught in the trap would not survive a thousand years... <br /> <br />The Enemy:  Utterly perfect, with one problem:  No Vulcan, a race that is ablood-brother to the Romulans, has the blood type needed to save the captured Romulan - yet Worf, a Klingon - is the sole person who CAN save this Romulan?!  Talk about shoehorning rubbish science into a scenario that's otherwise excellent, even with the silly uberdrama...  Maybe he should donate some blood and have it transfused into a poodle and see if the poodle survives.  That's what it boils down to. <br /> <br />The Price:  Even today, the romance subplot is heavyhanded, but the Ferengi get just desserts with their meddling.  :D <br /> <br />The Vengeance Factor:  Well done story about blood feud. <br /> <br />The Defector:  I used to love this one, but rewatching it reveals the uberdrama petty soap opera it sadly is.  It DOES have potential and a few surprise twists, but Picard taking all that time to instill excess drama into a situation that warrants fast response?  At that point I'd be cheering for the opposing team!!   <br /> <br />The Hunted:  A decent parallel to Vietnam vets; and hasn't dated much by today's standards either. <br /> <br />The High Ground:  Whew boy.  This anti-terrorism story doesn't fit well today.  It's too one-sided... <br /> <br />Deja Q:  Another Q episode.  How can't it be good?!  CLASSIC!  Q becomes human and the interplay with the crew is classic.  Especially when Guinan hears about the development...  Picard saving Q's bacon by the end is to be expected, but well handled. <br /> <br />A Matter of Perspective:  Pity we didn't have that in the terrorism story.  :rolleyes:  This one is far worse for having it...  best left forgotten. <br /> <br />Yesterday's Enterprise:  Classic.  Nice to see Yar back.  Also sets up a concept to be revived later on, which all things considered is brilliant. <br /> <br />The Offspring:  Remake of \\"The Measure of a Man\\" and the story, much like Lal, self-destructs because it's 100% derivative. <br /> <br />Sins of the Father:  Continues the Worf saga.  Until season 6 then DS9, this saga is fun. <br /> <br />Allegience:  Preachy and predictable, but has some nice set pieces. <br /> <br />Captain's Holiday:  More Ferengi?  A few nice set pieces and comedic moments, but naah... <br /> <br />Tin Man:  Another classic.  Reuses some f/x from Star Trek The Motion Picture, but it's easy to relate to Tam and especially To the Tin Man entity. <br /> <br />Hollow Pursuits:  Unworthy of any spite accorded to it; and Dwight Schultz is inspired casting.  great story on a man who isn't like the rest of us.  Pity we don't get more background info on him, but it is highly underrated. <br /> <br />The Most Toys:  Another well-handled gem.  The toy collector getting his just desserts in the end, too...  Great Data-centric story. <br /> <br />Sarek:  A plot so good that it got reused in Deep Space 9...  Sarek comes aboard and Picard mindmelds because Sarek is past his prime...  also sets up for a later story too... <br /> <br />Menage a Troi:  garbage. <br /> <br />Transfigurations:  An anti-xenophobia story.  A typical entry but has its momenets. <br /> <br />Best of Both Worlds:  A bit soapy at times, but there's no real reason to even begin to dislike it.  The Borg never improved after this story (apart from a novel released in 1991 that isn't considered canon...)
B000B8QEYC|5.0|5 stars are not enough for this wonderful CD. It gets at least 10! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CD. It arrived in perfect condition and within the least amount of time. Thank you!
B000062XFG|5.0|The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not... <br /> <br />$50 per season is on par and is a good price.

Nice talk re: abortion too.  Pulaski makes a great intro and despite being lambasted as a McCoy ripoff (for which the TNG spinoffs never get too many of), Pulaski was a great replacement for Crusher.  <br /> <br />Where Silence Has Lease:  Half trite, but the creepiness/horror factor kept it interesting.  All in all underrated. <br /> <br />Elementary, Dear Data:  Ah!  The stuff that REAL sci-fi is made out of.  A+++  Daniel Davis as Holmes is inspired casting to boot. <br /> <br />The Outrageous Okona:  Rejected Season 1 script?  best left ignored... <br /> <br />Loud as a Whisper:  An interesting take on mediation; things naturally go awry. of course... <br /> <br />The Schizoid Man:  Not the best, but very underrated and the creepy factor is also well done. <br /> <br />Unnatural Selection:  Ripoff of every \\"let's age 'em quickly\\" plot ever made.  Pulaski is fun to watch, but that's about it... <br /> <br />A Matteer of Honor:  Great Klingon story.  A bit pedestrian in its presentation (a frequent season 1 complaint), but I love it to pieces anyway. <br /> <br />The Measure of a Man:  The first and by far BEST story regarding Data's status as a sentient being.  <br /> <br />The Dauphin:  Bland entry. <br /> <br />Contagion:  Another AWESOME story.  Great use of ideas and is the first \\"computer virus\\" story.  Nice solution too. <br /> <br />The Royale:  Don't bother.  It's filler. <br /> <br />Time Squared:  Yowza.  Another story that goes where nobody has gone before; the first and best story regarding being caught in a time loop...  <br /> <br />The Icarus Factor:  I never cared for this type of story.  Too soapy.  Nice set pieces, but not ideal as a whole story. <br /> <br />Pen Pals:  Lovely in thought, but breaks Federation rules all over the place.  Not to mention Data being grossly out of character. <br /> <br />Q Who?:  Q is reminiscent of the 7th Doctor as he meddles with Picard and introduced them to the Cyber... whoops, the Borg.  Don't get my sarky comments wrong, this story is well defined, well acted, and is a total CLASSIC.  I could care less about the \\"Borg Nursery\\", but it's logical they'd have one... <br /> <br />Samaritan Snare:  A bizarre story, and watchable in its own mind, it is a bit disconcerting to watch...   <br /> <br />Up the Long Ladder:  Nice comedy piece that turns to horror as two branches of the same race ultimately have to learn to live together; one similar to 1800s Earth, the other that bleached its gene pool thanks to excessive cloning.  It is a noble story, but Riker - as usual - gets it on with the alien chick of the week... <br /> <br />Manhunt:  Another comedy piece; it depends if you like Lwaxana or not. <br /> <br />The Emissary:  Worf's background is explored.  So is K'Elhyr.  Pity she gets killed off. :( <br /> <br />Peak Performance:  A clever entry; simulating war games and in come the Ferengi in a performance on par to \\"The Battle\\". <br /> <br />Shades of Gray:  A clip show?!  Little faith in the series (half-understandable) or behind-the-scenes strike and other issues preventing a proper story from being made? <br /> <br />Season 2 is a big improvement; using directorial styles invented in other series.  But it's as much original as it is derivative thanks to exploring usually decent sci-fi ideas and making them work within the sphere of Trekdom.  Sadly, later series would ditch the cool sci-fi element and make the show drivel-preachy-drama of the week, with the Enteprise-D used (yet again) as a mere cargo ship...
B000BYA5GO|1.0|Beware, the so called widescreen edition presents the film in a 1.78:1 ratio whereas it was shown in a 2.40:1 ratio in theaters. Lion's Gate version of pan and scan
B000063V8U|1.0|The DVDs themselves are of good quality; I've rented many seasons' worth and reminded myself which stories throughout the run were good and which were not...<br /><br />$50 per season is on par and is a good price. (So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)<br /><br />Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.<br /><br />Season 6 continues the inane preachy banality introduced big-time for season 5.  The music continues to degenerate; and another composer with the same garish yet banal style only makes things even less interesting.  I'd say that, by this point when I first saw these in 1992-3, I was begging to see season 1 reruns as they were far more interesting (and still are)...<br /><br />Times Arrow II:  It's dealt with, Data survives.<br /><br />Realm of Fear:  Worst Barclay story; he's scared of transporters because he sees big centipedes in them.  Nice to see the 'effect' of teleportation, but the story is crackers.<br /><br />Man of the People:  A trite concept, but reasonably well handled.  not a classic by any measure, but it is watchable.<br /><br />Relics:  Dig into the vast well of Classic Trek to bring in the viewers for some reason; and we get James Doohan's best performance ever as Scotty.  Well written, well acted, nice sci-fi concept (Dyson sphere, even if improbable), there are no downsides here.  (unfortunately, the same people involved in making this story totally forget about it when writing the movie \\"Generations\\"...)<br /><br />Schisms:  Paying homage to \\"alien abductions\\" in general isn't very bright, but in a sci-fi show where you're travelling the galaxy in a starship, it's definitely scraping bottoms of barrels for plot ideas.<br /><br />True-Q:  Gee, a gay themed story that never meant to be!  And it's so much better than \\"The Outcast\\"!  A niche piece, I have a soft spot for it, and Q turning Crusher into a dog is priceless.<br /><br />Rascals:  Underrated and fun.  I'm not sure why as it's easy to tear this one apart.  But the Guinan/Ro discussion alone makes it worth watching; the talk of re-living a past to make up for its down sides was really good.  Gotta like this one too.<br /><br />A Fistful of Datas:  I don't recall, but it's a holodeck story that makes Data a villain.<br /><br />The Quality of Life: Yet another \\"is a machine sentient\\" story, as if all the others we had before weren't enough, this one outdoes all the others in terms of inane, pointless rehashing of old ideas.  And it's so shamelessly one-sided that I had to throw up.<br /><br />Chain of Command:  Replace the Borg with the Cardassians and it's 90% the same.  There are 4 lights, we know...  David Warner makes for a cool villain, however.  And his quality of acting would make \\"there are 5 lights\\" believeable.  It's a mixed bag, this one...<br /><br />Ship in a Bottle:  Nice continuation/conclusion to Moriarity except they didn't include the continuity from the first story; Moriarity knowing quite well about the Enterprise... still, it's great fun - with a terrific ending to boot.  A far better Barclay story!<br /><br />Aquiel - filler.<br /><br />Face of the Enemy:  Empty \\"Underground Railroad in space\\".  Troi is irritating, to say the least.  More concerned about being kidnapped, it's amazing she got the job done at all.<br /><br />Tapestry: CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC!  Best season 6 story BY FAR. (well, Relics comes close...)  Picard dies in an explosion and Q intercedes to give Picard a second chance...  And Picard learns a lesson about living in fear or having the guts to try to get ahead...  highly refreshing in a season of drivel that redefines the word to new lows.<br /><br />Birthright:  More waffle in what seems to be a parallel to America regarding part 2 with Worf...  pt 1 is centric to Data.<br /><br />Starship Mine:  Typically banal music hinders what is a decent action plot.  Though Picard being butch does stretch credibility; it's passable and there are some terrific set-pieces.<br /><br />Lessons:  Wow, Picard falls in love again - but has to send her to a possible death.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is surely Ang Lee's finest film to date. It is a profound and deeply moving meditation on the nature of love; masterfully directed and adapted for the screen and featuring two incredible, couragious performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.    Having read Annie Proulx's novella I found it remarkable how the details of her story and the flavour of her writing- those spare and startlingly matter-of-fact sentences- have been faithfully rendered in the film. Despite the length of the film, I don't feel there is an ounce of fat on it- the very deliberate pace, the long, lingering shots of the Wyoming highlands, the silences- all work to build the movie slowly but surely to its heart-rending final scenes. One review I read criticised the aforementioned nature shots but they are anything but gratuitous- throughout the course of the film the landscape comes to symbolise Ennis and Jack's intimacy- their freedom to express their love for each other- and all these shots are full of that tension.     Heath Ledger is extraordinary in this film. His Ennis is a strong physical and sexual presence, but the way Ledger essays Ennis' inner torment is quite unforgettable. The mumbling, barely opening his mouth to speak, the constantly averted glances, the eyes, the smallest changes of facial expression. His emotions are always there, simmering away, never far from the surface. Some of his scenes are almost unbearable to watch- and these are usually the scenes where the depth and intensity of his love for Jack are revealed. I'll single out four such scenes.     Firstly, the scene after they first leave Brokeback, where the two men have a terrible, awkward goodbye- Jack's longing for them to remain in touch is thwarted by Ennis' inability to resolve his feelings and Jack eventually drives off, leaving Ennis walking down the road. When Jack is out of sight Ennis moves to the roadside and sobs uncontrollably, overwhelmed by his emotions, shielding his face with his hat. Then the scene in which the men are reunited after four years of living apart, in which Ennis is totally unable to suppress his emotions and his desire for Jack- this is the  scene that is witnessed by Ennis' shocked wife. Then two scenes from the last part of the film. Firstly, when Jack desperately reveals that he can't bear to be apart from Ennis, which is followed by a flashback of the two men standing in front of a camp fire, all those years ago when they first worked together, Jack looking love-lost in front of the fire, Ennis softly singing to him. The potency of this scene is how quickly and efficiently it draws high contrast between the young, high-spirited men and the men who, 20 years later are leading completely different lives. The scene in which Ennis discovers Jack's blue parker in Jack's parents house after Jack's death is played to perfection- we register Ennis' profound sense of loss but he does not break down- as Jack's parents are downstairs and his fear, even then, keeps him from allowing his emotions to flow.     Ang Lee has taken themes in the novella to a whole new level. With his restrained and almost at times austere direction I found that the homosexuality drifted to the back of my mind- that I was not seeing two men but two individuals fighting to realise their love for each other in the outside world. Indeed I feel that the films great message is that if you are unable to live the relationships you are supposed to live- then this can and does serve to damage and even destroy other relationships.     Jake Gyllenhaal is also superb in this film. He creates a character that lights up the screen in every frame he is in. Of course Jack is a foil for Ennis- being lighter and more idealistic than the laconic, tormented Ennis- but time and again I was so moved by the way Jack articulates his love for Ennis- the cajoling, the horsing about, the harmonica playing, the humour- especially in the scene where he demonstrates his rodeo riding to Ennis. Jack's death is so terrible, especially as it comes true almost as a prophecy to Ennis, bringing full-circle the shocking vision he was shown as a child.     I really enjoyed the way Ennis' eldest daughter was drawn in the film. Revealing to the bar chick that Ennis 'probably wasn't the marrying kind' was a beautiful, prescient observation of her father's nature. We feel her want to be closer to her father, nowhere more so than at the end of the film where she asks her father to come to her wedding, and Ennis- so lost, disoriented, alone and bereft manages to turn his thoughts towards her, to be there for her. But only after asking her if 'she really loves Curt'.     The film is a draining but totally rewarding experience and it will stay with you long after you've left the cinema.    It's a classic.     See it.
B00005JO1P|4.0|I suspect I knew a dozen Johnny Cash songs prior to seeing this movie.  At its conclusion, I wanted to go out and buy the Folsom Prison album.  That probably makes it a successful movie!<br /><br />I did wish I knew how much was fantasy and fact.  Was June Carter really such an angel?  Did Johnny Cash really improve that much between his first and seccond song?  Did Johnny really interact with all these other famous musicians?<br /><br />The acting was first rate.  The singing was passionate.  The tension (or lack of it) between the characters was believable .<br /><br />I guess this movie was rated PG-13 for drug use and mild profanity.  This is a pretty good movie to invite friends over to see (when it comes out on DVD).  Enjoy.
B000005YZM|4.0|'Odessey and Oracle', released in July of 1968, was the last of four albums released by The Zombies in the 1960's. It's often regarded as the band's zenith, which is ironic since they disbanded because they felt stale musically (although leader Rod Argent went on to record the single 'Hold Your Head Up', it doesn't seem like reason enough to have left this seasoned group of musicians).  A good number of people regard the album as one of the masterpieces of the 1960's, but it did not chart well when it was first released, which hastened the dissolution of the band.  In fact, The Zombies did not even tour to promote the disc.  Ironically, in January of the following year, 'Time of the Season', the last track on the disc, was released as a single and rocketed to number three on the US charts, prompting unrequited cries for the band to reform.  The album charted better on the heals of 'Time of the Season' (the band's first Top 10 number since they hit number six with 'Tell Her No' in 1965; their only higher charting single was 'She's Not There', released in 1964), but there was always a disconnect between it's perceived quality and its commercial success.    The failure of 'Odessey and Oracle' can probably be traced to the overall feel of the disc.  While many bands were exploring a a variety of genres in their albums, much of 'Odessey and Oracle' is sweet, melodious, and relationship-based.  There are no angry guitars, few psychedelic musings, and no experimental or revolutionary gimmicks.  The compositions are all solid, some outstanding, the musicianship is sharp, and the harmonies rival the best of the era, perhaps excluding only Crosby, Stills and Nash.  So there is much to be enjoyed on 'Odessey...', but it is essential that you enjoy, and don't tire of (for the most part), soft, well-constructed, melodious fare.    The best track on the disc is, of course, 'Time of the Season'.  It's an epic track that has become timeless, and along with anthems such as 'Going Upthe Country' by Canned Heat, a song that epitomizes the late 1960's.  Not much else on 'Odessey...', however, sounds as fascinating as this, the closing track on the disc.  When listening to the CD, keep in mind that these songs were first released on vinyl, with the first six tracks accounting for side one.  That side ended with ' Hung Up On a Dream', clearly chosen for its crescendo as the first closer.  The opener on side one is probably the second best track.  'Care of Cell 44' possesses an unequivically upbeat mood, which fits with its 'reuniting lovers' theme, but belies its amusing twist: the man's girlfriend is serving prison time.  'A Rose For Emily' follows, unique in that it deals with lonliness, while 'Maybe After He's Gone' focuses on wishful thinking for the demise of an ex's newfound love.  'Beechwood Park', a soft ballad, is an exercise in nostalgia and vibrato sounds, while 'Brief Candles' offers a sweet contrast in tempo between the verses and the catchy chorus lines.    Side two on the original vinyl starts out with two of the less distinguished, more generic tracks, 'Changes' and 'I Want Her She Wants Me'.  Either keyboardist Rod Argent and bassist Chris White, who penned all the tunes on 'Odessey...', began running out of melodies, or it all just starts sounding too similar, until track nine introduces the first non-relationship based composition.  'The Butchers Tale', subtitled '(Western Front 1914)', tips off the nature of this song as an anti-war track.  Although chronologically nested in the First World War, one can't help but to listen to the song as a contemporary anti-Vietnam War track.  The words speak to the brutality of all war, however, and Chris White's vocals at times can make your hair stand on end, so it is a vibrant contrast with the bulk of the albums fare.  'Friends of Mine' is yet another catchy number, giving kudo's to couples who are friends, not to one another, but to the singer in a third person perspective.    The 30th anninversay edition of this disc offers the entire album in stereo and mono versions.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to hear these recordings in mono, although it may be how one first heard and remembers the original vinyl edition.  The stereo version is vastly superior.  Alternate versions of three tracks are offered as a bonus, although you will have to listen closely to hear any discrepencies.  The alternate version of 'Time of the Season' seems most altered, but that is probably due to being overly familiarity with the original version of the song.  Lyrics are included in the expansive liner notes, which also features band photographs and displays of news clippings and other memorabilia.  This album is certainly a must-listen for anyone interested in the best of 1960's popular music.
0792833201|5.0|That was my first reaction after watching the film.  Although people call it a Spielberg film, director credit goes to Tobe Hooper, man responsible for Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Unlike that film though which is creepiness galore, this film is a bit more streamlined with memorable spookiness. With Spielberg you'll get kiddie friendliness although how this managed to pull off a PG(apparently hard fought) is beyond me.<br /><br />The film can accurately be described in one sentence: a family tries to get back their daughter after she's abducted into the TV. There's nothing else really besides the occasional thing that goes bump in the night that happens to have teeth or can move around. Usually these kind of films don't have much of a plot anyway but we're not looking for novel-like twists and turns, just a good scare or 2.<br /><br />The film contains many memorable moments such as the classic line \\"they're here\\", and probably the fastest facial surgery you'll ever see(which to be honest I think Stir of Echoes \\"borrowed\\" from). Not to mention the film had a great pace. As co-star Heather O'Rourke(Carol Anne) said: \\"The first one really kept you going. It was exciting. Well, after you see it a lot of times, it isn't so much. But the first time you see it, it really jumps you.\\" No arguments here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that very same actress was part of a sad duel tragedy as a rare disease ended up claiming her life at age 12. It's really sad to see her quotes on IMDB since she obviously would've loved to pursue acting as a career. The other tragedy was co-star Dominique Dunne(Dana), who was killed in 1982.<br /><br />Now hopefully I'm right but I hear there's going to be a Special Edition soon and it sure needs it. There's literally 4 menu options, the only bonus feature is the theatrical trailer. We need commentaries, making-ofs and retrospectives. It's a well-made horror film without being outright scary. It's more like a fun kind of scary, if there is such a thing.h a thing. <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|What can be said about Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain... beautiful. I was so excited that it was expanding to my area, and I went to see it the first day of release. I had heard so much hype about the film that I was almost anticipating disappointment. I was wrong. Brokeback Mountain is a delicate film, full of life and splendor. The cast and writers handled the subject matter with elegance and passion, and the simpler aspects of the film, cinematography, etc. were just as well handled. <br /> <br />I was so pleased with the cast of Brokeback Mountain. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaall made the perfect couple - sexy, dangerous, and forbidden.  Their chemistry was beyond description, and their love scenes were realistic and sensual. (The tent scene is unbelievable, I blushed through the entire thing). I could constantly feel their pain and longing - especially Gyllenhaal's character Jack - amazing. Furthermore, the women were just as fascinating. Anne and Michelle were able to achieve in a few short minutes what some actors fail to do in hours of dull film They were thoughtful and powerful; their reactions to their husbands' behaviors were unbelievable. I was crushed by Michelle, who is receiving most of the praise, and Anne, who is unjustly being overlooked. Her phone conversation with Ennis is one of the most moving scenes in the entire film. <br /> <br />Ang, Heath, Jake, Michelle, and Anne's greatest achievement is their delicacy. They turned what could have been a \\"gay cowboy\\" film into a work of art. I think Ebert said it best. He came to the conclusion that the film is so affective because it does not focus on the \\"gay\\" issue but rather on the story and characters. Ennis, Jack, Alma, and Lureen are so real that the reason for their existence is a non-issue.  The is a story about love, passion, and pain, not about homosexuality and adultery. Brokeback Mountain does not preach or judge for or against the characters' actions, rather it seeks to tell a story - a rarity in Hollywood - and it does so flawlessly.
B00005JOFO|5.0|The reason \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is such a powerful movie is based on what isn't said, rather than what is. <br /> <br />None of the major characters, Ennis and Jack, and their respective wives, know how to communicate with one another or even know how to make sense of their own feelings. The inexplicable love the men feel for one another and the growing bitterness of their wives due to emotional neglect are clear to the audience, but not to the characters themselves. This lack of communication is probably a universal trait affecting everyone at one time or another. <br /> <br />This lack of communication leads to the final bittersweet realization for Ennis that a life lived for the sake of societal approval can be an empty life indeed and that if one allows outside influences to trump love, one may be left with only memories and yearnings of a life that might have been. <br /> <br />And yet, Ennis grows and matures from his experiences. In a particularly poignant scene, Ennis gives up an important job so that he'll be free to attend his daughter's wedding. If Ennis's inability to deal with his emotions made him a distant father while his daughter was growing up, he has finally learned to value her love and acts accordingly. <br /> <br />A scene between Ennis and Jack's mother is also particularly touching, since the non-verbal communication indicates a bond between them -- a shared love for Jack -- while Jack's antagonistic father looks on. <br /> <br />There are many such scenes, but it would be difficult to touch upon all of them without giving too much away for those who haven't yet experienced this film. <br /> <br />On a different topic, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is an important crossover movie. Although there are many gay-themed comedies and dramas, they seldom hit multiplex theaters. \\"Brokeback\\" is different in that it is a love story with universal appeal about the nature of love more than it is about love objects. And as such, its critical acclaim and awards (with more to come) are well deserved. <br /> <br />I have one other general comment.  From reading through some of these reviews, it is apparent (and sad) that certain homophobic people who have not experienced \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and probably never will, go through these reviews so that they can secretly vote on how \\"unhelpful\\" all the positive reviews are to them and then vote on how \\"helpful\\" the very few negative reviews are to them. If such people actually sat through the movie, it is just possible that some of their hatred and some of their fear might go away. If this were to happen, would it be such a terrible thing?  <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|So the most important question is: Was shakira able to prove her artist credibility after she released the catchy, aimed-to-mainstream-united-states Laundry Service album? And the answer is yes. She did it, and I knew she would. I never doubted her talent because Laundry service was still good album in comparison to the omnipresent musical junk out there. It was just shakired watered down so it would be easier for her new public, mainstream U.S. I laughed when I read people comparing her to the Latin Britney. That is just wrong. Where's britney now?Oh yeah, who cares. In contrast, Shakira has maintained an impressive career. Laundry Service was just a smart move to alude the masses. With Fijacion Oral Vol. 2 she proves that she has matured. The lyrics in her songs are shorter than in her previous songs, but they are just as intense and full with force. Her lyricism has also matured well. And the music is just unbeliavable! Who brings so much musical diversity  into one album song--contrasting beats, gregorian choruses, latin,rock-, let alone into one song, and emerge so triumphantly? Not many. So buy this album(and FIJACIONORAL 1) and appreciate her talent. Viva La musica LAtina! I also recommend ELY GUERRA's LOTOFIRE. THAT ALBUM WILL ALSO BLOW YOU AWAY!
B00007GZR5|5.0|What Dreams May Come (a line from the famous 'To be or not to be' speech from Hamlet) is ranked among my all time favorite movies.  I personally believe in a life after death, and my own views vary from those presented in the movie a bit, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie thoroughly.  What makes this one of my favorite movies is perhaps the attention to detail that they put into feelings and human emotions, particularly the concepts of regret and what it means to have true love.  Ever since I lost my own true love, this movie makes me cry, but I love it all the same.  It also helps to remind me that I need to always strive to be a better father.
B00005YJMX|5.0|bravo. superb. a german masterpiece. the best vampire movie, yet. if you are into art films, then this is a must for your collection. no blood and gore, no sex, no violence, and no cheap hollywood stints. there is just plain, excellent acting, directing, musical score and photography. the plot stays true to the original novel and the 1922 silent version of the german classic. the only blood in the film, is when harker( victim)accidentally cuts his thumb. klaus kinski(nosferatu), the best dracula, ever, says very little, but instead acts with his eyes and body laauage. isablle adjani, the seductive heroine, saves the day. and, she is as beutiful as her acting talent. the movie flows so beutifully, from one scene to the next. it is a must see, even if you are only renting the video.
B000AP04L0|5.0|A must have for any DVD collection.  Office Space can make you think of all the jobs you've had where you simply wanted to get through the day. Exceptional acting, great supporting actors and the Flair does justice for all the movie buffs who want to know how it was done.  Fast becoming a new classic to symbolize the 80's and corporate America.
0800177177|3.0|Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are (in my opinion) terribly miscast in this film. Their performances are wooden and unnatural. But Gary Oldman is worth the price of admission alone - it's obvious he takes great pleasure playing Dracula and does a great job. The sets, costumes, music and effects are all wonderful as well, making this a decent version of Dracula - but not necessarily a DVD worth owning unless you're a die-hard fan of the genre.
B00004SW9R|5.0|Something about this music connects much more deeply than you might expect. Dr John grew up in the midst of strong currents, and he brings them into a place we can access. I 'preciate it.
B000002KDM|5.0|Mud Slide Slim brings back old memories of music you could sing along to. James Taylor blends his music with your life. Highly reccommended!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|I adore John Cusack and have since \\"Sixteen Candles\\". I love his versatility and his choice of distinct characters. My rule of thumb is if John Cusack is in the movie, it's guaranteed I will love it. It hasn't failed me yet. <br />However, as with loads of women who grew up in the '80s, I have a real soft spot for Lloyd Dobler, his inimitable \\"Say Anything\\" alter ego. Who didn't fall in love with this guy? So imagine my surprise when, already eager for this romantic comedy, I tuned in and got reaquainted with my old crush. <br />Cusack's Jake, to me, is Lloyd 16 years on. Adorable, witty, goofy, insecure...in short, he was fantastic. Diane Lane shines as the ambivalent divorcee thrust into the online dating pool. Elizabeth Perkins, so perfect as the bitchy friend from \\"About Last Night...\\" is endearing as the meddling older sister. Stockard Channing is hilarious as a three-time divorcee pining for Diane's dad, played by Christopher Plummer. And Dermot Mulroney is terrific as the cad. <br />This is an enjoyable, heartwarming film all around, but the real prize is seeing John Cusack bring Jake to life as a man not unfamiliar to us, but as lovable and charming as ever. No one can do teen angst like he did, and he's a master at the adult version, as well. <br />Watch for the scene at the Armenian restaurant when he gazes across the table at Diane Lane with that piercing, lovestruck gaze. SWOON!
0307276902|5.0|I know there has been a big hoopla about James Frey and that he embellished his book to the point of lying.  I also know that Oprah stood behind him when she called the Larry King Show, but inevitably changed her mind and apologized to the world on her talk show recently.  I saw her show when James Frey was on (both times), and to tell you the truth I felt bad for him the last time he was on (just a few days ago)when Oprah lamblasted him from all sides.  I'm actually surprised that he would subject himself to all that humiliation. <br />Personally I do not believe anything in \\"type\\" anymore, because so many people lie.  I used to trust my hometown newspaper, but not anymore.  Sensationalism seems to be where it's at.  You see it daily on the newscasts. So, whether or not James Frey lied is irrelevant to me personally, because I did enjoy his story.
B00008PC2O|3.0|I was really excited to see this film in HD format.  But because of the licensing for the film you can only watch it in America or Canada.  Of course that is not stated anywhere.  The normal film is good quality but I wanted to see the HD format.  Amazon should state that a product will only work within the USA or Canada.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I had no idea what to expect with this, good sci-fi movie's are so hard to find these days, plus I had never seen any of the short-lived TV series 'Firefly' which this was based on. Well, I'm happy to report that not only do you not need to have seen the series to follow this, but you're going to have a real good time watching this. It is really done well, strong action and acting with some perfectly timed comedic touches. It is two hours long, but I was actually wishing it had been a little longer as I was that into it. I'm probably going to get torched for this, but I'd pick this over the last Star Wars just slightly, which was the last decent sci-fi I'd seen before Serenity.<br /><br />Keep this name in mind, Summer Glau, she plays River, the whole movie is pretty much based around her, and she is one hell of an actress, plus the girl has some incredible fight scenes that will knock your socks off. I'm sure she had some training and a stunt double, but even if that means she only performed half of the stunts, it's still pretty impressive. Nathan Fillion plays Reynolds, the captain of his ship 'Serenity' and I know once you see him you'll recognize him, he was the husband of the girl in 'Two guys, a girl, and a pizza place. He too is very solid, both charming and intense when need be. Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays the main bad guy from The Alliance, a group that wants the powerfull River all to themselves, but can't seem to catch up with Reynolds and his crew who River and her brother are flying with. He shows no emotion, you almost think he might be an android, but he to can kick alot of butt, and his fight scene toward the end with Captain Reynolds is quite a watch.<br /><br />The rest of Reynolds crew are all very good, including Adam Baldwin, who plays Jayne, and some of his back-and-forth with Reynolds is priceless. Also, the movie looks great, no grain, great sound, outstanding sets and locations, and the battle scenes between the spaceships does rival some of the best Star Wars endings. It is surprisingly violent for a PG-13, and also has lots of salty languange, I'd say 14 years old and above should be fine. I'm not going to go into much of the plot, mostly because it's rather complicated and I don't want to ruin anything for anyone who wants to rent Firefly first before watching this. My only complaint is the man who plays River's brother is a real wuss, and I didn't care for his character at all, it may or may not be the actor's fault, but it sucked. He whines alot and gets his assed kicked severall times by both the good guys and the bad........wuss.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Hollywood doesn't seem to into sci-fi's anymore, but it was real refreshing to not only see one, but a good one at that. Although they tied most of the loose ends up, I have heard rumors that a sequel is being discussed, mostly because it was such a surprise at the box-office. But if you think about, why was it such a surprise? there are so many sci-fi fans out there, and so few movies, you are almost guaranteed success if you even make a crappy one. Well, I rented Red Eye with this, so I'll be back soon with some thoughts on Wes Craven'a latest suspense ride, until then, take care all......tween the spaceships does rival some of the best Star Wars endings.

074325144X|5.0|The book is clear and concise and actually has something new to say. Dreyer writes without ego, a refreshing change from most books on running. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to run and would like to love running even more.
0307276902|5.0|Anyone who has ever known an addict should be able to tell you what they think is real and what we think is real are sometimes two different things.  James stated \\"It was my reality\\" <br />I have no doubt(even though he admitted some falsehoods) that  <br />he actually could have thought the things he was writing were at least in  some way true.  My son was an addict and I heard some tall tales from him that I knew were not true, but he  <br />absolutely believed them. <br />Besides as someone else said if this book can help people what is the difference?
B000301YY8|5.0|all of a sudden, james blunt is a big deal.  i started listening to him about 2 months ago before he was on SNL and before his cd became a top seller.   i got the cd because i liked 'so long jimmy'  and thought 'goodbye lover' was an okay song.   i listened to the cd maybe 3 times before i got sick of james blunts whiny falsetto voice.   okay, so his songs are 'ballads'  and supposedly super deep and meaningful.   but i dont get it.     the guys voice isnt great, i've heard songs like his a million times, and so what if he plays piano instead of rocking out on guitar?        i just really wasn't impressed.   plus what's with the jim morrison album cover thing?      oh well.     i'd say the only good songs are 'so long jimmy', 'billy', and possibly (if i'm being very kind) 'wisemen'.   i used to like 'you're beautiful', but then it was the albums single and its so overplayed that i hate it now.      ya, so if you like breathless british men singing in falsetto about love and war, this album is definitely for you.      (btw, i accidentally rated this 5 stars and it wont let me change it back for some reason, so just for the record, i didnt mean it.   i say 2 STARS.   certainly not 5...sorry for the mistake)

You choose a card to fit into the easel, where it sits nice and secure-it can't fall out.<br /><br />You'll want to read or listen to The Power of Now first, however. These cards are just a brief excerpt of the masterwork.

A sneaky villian who tells everything about their evil plot in the end?  A bond forming between these two agents as they chase the sneaky villain?  An action thriller that uses such descriptive adjectives as \\"murderous\\" and \\"deadly\\" on seemingly every page instead of actually taking the time to examine actions and motivations? <br /> <br />Yes, dear reader, all this awaits you in this bestselling piece of pabulum from our very un-original sissy thriller writer, David Baldacci.  If it seems like you have read it all before and better, you have.  But remember, this heroine (with the unfortunate name of Michelle Maxwell) wins olympic medals.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Alright so i bought this the other day,i never knew who behemoth was  but deiceded to see if they were any good. And man was I amazed! I knew i made a good choice. This is some of the best death metal i heard yet. I loved the drums, and the vocals were different but awsome! Some of the best tracks are- Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth, Slaves Shall Serve, and The Reign Ov Shemu-Hor. I def. recomend this.
B000002KD9|5.0|A great rock album from 1970. Everyone knows Southern Man, but I find myself listening to all the other tracks. Great lyrics, piano, guitar throughout. Easy listening.

B00009UW0N|5.0|The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and one of my dopest favorite. Even though I've seen it numerous times I can't get enough, on Halloween night in 1963, 6 year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc amongst the trick or treaters. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still slithering creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie. If you only see one horror movie in your lifetime, then fire up a blunt, kick back and see this absolute classic again, Halloween
B000BYA5GO|4.0|There is one scene in Lord of War where Nicolas Cage's character leans over a statue of Lenin counting his profits on a calculator, which symbolically provides a strong notion of how a nation has failed its people.  However, the notion should not only be applied to the former Soviet Union, since as the film unfolds it is obvious that the corruption exists in all nations of the world.  This suggests that numerous nations in the world have failed their people.  Lord of War focuses on the arms dealers and the corruption and deception that trail this spineless profession, as they sell weapons to all of those who can pay regardless of human lives.<br /><br />Empty shells in the millions lay on the ground spread out around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), which means business is booming for a stone cold arms dealer.  Yuri's expensive suit bears proof in his success dealing in arms trade and that he never gets involved wherever the weapons are sold.  Consequently, he provides the audience with staggering facts that there is one firearm per 12 people in the world to which he comments on how he could arm the other eleven.<br /><br />A jump cut brings the viewer to the manufacturing of a bullet from the stage of being a sheet of metal to when it is fired and enters the head of a child.  The child who is shot is also firing a machinegun.  It is a powerful message displaying the impersonal machinery of making weapons, but it also shows how penetrating personal each bullet is when they hit an intended targets.<br /><br />Through a large amount of voice-over the audience learns the story of Yuri.  It is a told in an authentic manner, according to Yuri, as he begins with informing the audience about how he got started selling weapons.  It is clear that he began for the same reasons many try to make a better living for themselves while dreaming of a better life.  Besides this he tells us about the importance of the environment, and how it affected his choice to go into arms dealing.<br /><br />The story stretches over a 20-year period, as he makes deals with anyone interested in buying weapons.  It covers drug lords, warlords, freedom fighters, terrorists, dictators, and nations trying to get their hands on weapons otherwise not accessible.  Some of these characters affect Yuri's life in a negative manner, but he ignores the bad aspects of the business, as he is good at it.  Yuri also does not care to whom he sells his weapons, as long as the paycheck comes through.  He even informs the audience that he does not make business with Osama Bin Laden, as his checks bounce.<br /><br />It might seem a little morbid, but the film also effectively applies a heavy dose of irony in order to show the two sides of the story.  The irony also works well to Yuri's comments, as he rationalizes why he is in the business of selling firearms.  After all, the only true winners of wars are the arms salesmen.<br /><br />Initially, it feels a little frustrating with the large amount of voice-over, however, as the story unfolds the voice-over enhances the authentic atmosphere, as if Yuri really was telling his life story.  The camera functions much like an extension to Yuri's voice-over that helps fill in the details of his dirty job.  In addition, the cinematography occasionally augments the visual imagery through excellent scene framing that brings out an artistic side of the dark world of arms deals.  The visual aesthetics and powerful issue in the film brings together a genuinely intriguing cinematic experience that keeps the audience thinking while being entertained on a high level.. <br /> <br />The story stretches over a 20-year period, as he makes deals with anyone interested in buying weapons.

0312995423|2.0|This book was the literary equivalent of fingers scratching a chalkboard.  It was a root canal in print.  Poorly researched science, characters crafted from imitation cardboard (the real cardboard must have been too expensive) working toward goals that were anything but noble (oh no! What a tragedy if the government can't spy on all our emails!  What would become of civilization?), and plot contrivances that made you groan at how childish they were.  As if the greatest codebreakers in the world couldn't figure out the stupid riddle about uranium isotopes.  The whole theme of cryptography is overplayed in such a forced fashion by the geeky Mr. Brown that he actually tries to incorporate it into the courtship ritual of our two egghead hotties (of course).   <br /> <br />Perhaps the most offensive part of this book is that we must be on the side of an Orwellian organization that maintains the unwarranted ability to spy on every message sent by every person or organization in the world.  Why should we favor the unimpeded government access to all our personal writings?  Because the hot cryptographer works for the government, of course. <br /> <br />I must confess that this is the first Dan Brown book I have read, and I am not going to pick up another.  Anyone whose thought processes allow him to create a book of this ilk is not on my reading list, no matter how many people bought his previous work.

B00009P1O2|4.0|The concert presented on this DVD was amazing and had a spectacular presentation. One of the things i didn't like was the audience participation. Of course they went for a sing-along with Freddie but their reactions were a little disapproving. At every concert, their should be applause and even a lot of screams and cheers but at this concert their were few moments where the audience screamed and cheered and most of it were hand-clapping. In addition if this aired on TV some parts should have been censored. For example, Freddie said the \\"f\\" word twice and most of all in the bonus feature of QueenCam, I saw one member of the audience raise both arms and stick up both middle fingers.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|FIREFLY is a Sci-Fi channel series about a crew on board a firefly type spaceship called Serenity. It's an amazing series where you are instantly immersed into the lives of the crew trying to survive being outlaws in a kind of futuristic western. <br />I personally saw the series backwards by watching the movie SERENITY first, falling in love with it, and then watching the series FIREFLY second. I don't recommend that. <br />If you love a good immersive sci-fi series, FIREFLY and the movie SERENITY is amazing. I highly recommend it.

0307276902|4.0|Though we now know this book is mostly fiction, and should read it as such, it's still a good book. The writer should've stuck with a 'fiction' label, but that's useless hindsight now. Perhaps what needs to be pointed out is that I've read many nonfiction research books that were later found to be 'less than accurate', and that goes for newspapers, magazine articles, etc. Anymore, you have to do your own research and keep in mind that just because it's in writing, that doesn't mean it's true. I've never had such illusions, no matter which memoir or other work of nonfiction I'm reading. However, this is still a great read and I don't regret buying my copy. Oprah has my sympathy, but we can all learn from this and 'move on'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />Author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
B00005KHJV|4.0|This movie is timeless. It is scary in every generation. John Carpenters Halloween is a classic.<br /><br />The movie is about a young high school girl named laurie strode and her skanky friends. They are being stocked by a crazed lunatic named Micheal Myers. So the deaths come rolling in. What makes this movie amazing is the creepyness of it. The way Micheal moves and kills his victums weather its dressing as a ghost with glasses of strangling some girl in a car. He is so scary. The scariest part is when Jamie Lee is crying and she thinks hes dead and you see in the background him getting up in some creppy way and looking over at her. Scary as hell. So I say buy?
0307276902|4.0|Frey's writing style,  a feeling of stream of conscious thinking, is a very compellng read.  He exposes himself in a way that you are routing for him to win his battle  and stay sober. Personally, It doesn't matter to me that he embellihsed some remembrances, the story at it's core is one of his own experience.  He is genuine, and a great story teller.
B00003CWPL|4.0|The one and only, Eraserhead.  What can I say about this film?  I can either say it's boring and stupid, or that it's artsy fartsy or that Lynch is  genius who has created a wonderfully nightmarish film.  Whether it's your thing or not, Lynch has created a rather unique film.  Personally, I'm not gonna tell you that I understand all that is going on.  There is a thin plot running throughout the film, so it's not just a bunch of nonsense that you can't follow.  I just like the mood and feel of the film, which is rather unsettling.  If you allow yourself to get into the mood that is.  Alot of folks will just watch this, shake their heads and not allow themselves to just go with it.  Like most folks say, it's like a filmed nightmare.  That's quite accurate, coz it does play out like one.  It's full of bizarre sounds:  Humming, wind, machinery, steam, strange music, crying, squeaking, factory noises.  The sounds themselves are nightmarish.  The film looks to be either in the future or a really desolated part of town.  Everyone in the film needs psychiatric help coz they say and do oddball things.  With no \\"normal\\" characters to relate to, you lose all sense of reality.  Even Blue Velvet had a few normal characters to save you from the craziness of it all.  Jack Nance looks either frightened or confused the entire time, yet he is probably the most normal one in the film.  The dvd looks and sounds great.  It even has an 84 minute interview with Lynch about the film.  It's very long winded though.  He talks for a half hour before he even gets to the meat and potatoes of the whole thing.  He tends to get off on tangents that are just downright boring unless you're a drooling Lynch fanatic.  I'm not gonna sit here and tell you this is a great movie.  It's hard to do that coz this film doesn't really exist in any other film category.  It's not really as pretentious and arty as you may think-I think Lynch just did a great job of making an extremely unsettling universe.  If that's artsy, than I guess it is.  People into Lynch and have seen many of his other films will no doubt want to see this.  Not all Lynch fans like this, I've known a few.  Some feel obligated to like it coz it's Lynch, and that's no reason to claim to like a film.  And no, you're not shallow or \\"unintelligent\\" if you don't like the film.  If anyone calls you \\"unintelligent\\" for not \\"getting\\" or enjoying Eraserhead, you can always be happy with the fact that you're at least not a snobby, uptight prick.  I suggest not disregarding the negative or positive reviews posted here.  You will most likely fall into one of the two camps when you finish the film.  However, the staying power of this film cannot be denied.  Many of the negative reviewers state, \\"I saw this movie 20 years ago......I saw this years ago.....It sucked and it still sucks!\\".  If you saw this film once many years ago and are now looking it up on Amazon to bash it, there is something to be said for that.  Should you watch Eraserhead?  Most definitely.  Then you decide, then tell us how much you love it or hate it.  Now you don't have to wait 20 years to do so.t's artsy, than I guess it is.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Ya know, for TRL favorites this band kicks some serious rear end, I'm an old dog who was weened on bands like Slayer and Megadeth and I gotta say, Avenged Sevenfold sound like my teenage years.<br /><br />Just a great band for those that like it loud and hard in a time when it all seems to be soft and sweet.
B00005V331|5.0|This album is a true 5 star album,it is easily the best of any other black metal album and probably even Venoms best. <br />I remember the day i bought it because when i put it on it was an experience i had never had before then and have never had since. <br />When the first song came on i was already thinking it was worth the money. <br />The riffs on this album are good although its a simple made album it is truly a master piece. <br />I personaly think the lyrics are some of the best but alot of people i know werent as keen on them.If you like black metal or Venom then you cannot resist this album. <br />It may not have the sound quality of the newer stuff but it has more class and darkness to it then any of the newer stuff. <br />Im not gonna beg you to buy it because if your smart youll go buy it right now wether i say so or not <br />because pretty much every review about this album is a 4/5 star. <br />Well worth the money.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This release is without a doubt A7X's best.  They take their hard hitting metalcore style of their previous album and throw a bunch of sweet melody into the mix, making for a great mix of style.  Please, if you're just discovering A7X, get this and not City of Evil.  Please listen to all of the other people here who agree with me, City of Evil is complete sellout trash, and this is true A7X before the media raped them up the ass.
068983571X|5.0|When Henry Baskerville, the last remaining scion of the family, travels from Canada to England to take up residence in Baskerville Hall after the puzzling violent death of his uncle, Sir Charles, he is immediately greeted with a string of baffling mysteries not the least of which is the legend of an enormous hound residing on the moors in Devon. Dr James Mortimer, family friend to the Baskervilles, engages Holmes and Watson to advise and protect Henry and to resolve the issue of the hound's existence once and for all. Not one to believe in supernatural phantoms such as this spectral hound from hell endowed with \\"blazing eyes and dripping jaws\\", Holmes dispatches Watson to scout out the terrain and place the neighbouring residents under the proverbial magnifying glass - Stapleton, the accomplished entomologist and his beautiful sister, Beryl, who attempts to warn off Henry from taking up residence in the hall; Frankland, a crotchety busybody with a telescope and his troubled daughter, Laura Lyons, recovering from an ill-advised marriage; and the Barrymores, long time butler and housekeeper to the Baskerville family, who are clearly carrying a disturbing secret of their own.<br /><br />True to the well-established paradigm of the Holmes canon, Doyle allows Watson to tell the tale with a deliciously full serving of speculation, theorizing based on \\"incomplete data\\", emotion, gentlemanly bravado, flowery Victorian atmosphere, elegant dialogue, and extensive detail on the routine of daily living at the turn of the century such as communicating by telegram and traveling by coach. His development of the bleak, dark, gloomy atmosphere of the moor is masterful:<br /><br />\\"Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream.\\"<br /><br />An easy one evening read over the comfortable space of a couple of hours, The Hound of the Baskervilles moves swiftly from the traditional cozy opening of Holmes' Baker Street digs to a resounding climax that is packed with more excitement and action than almost any other story in the entire Holmes litany. Two thumbs up and a five star recommendation to readers of all ages!<br /><br />Paul Weissurs, The Hound of the Baskervilles moves swiftly from the traditional cozy opening of Holmes' Baker Street digs to a resounding climax that is packed with more excitement and action than almost any other story in the entire Holmes litany.

B000A6T1KE|5.0|OK I'm biased being a Trek fan however despite the battering this film has taken it's worth a second chance. <br /> <br />The acting is excellent and the story itself is fine. <br /> <br />All of the usual stuff is there the evil villain, the epic battles, fantastic sound quality for your home theatre system and of course the Earth in mortal danger. <br /> <br />My only niggle about the film is the lack of work for Worf, Crusher and Geordi, in what was pitched as the final outing for this crew. <br /> <br />Hopefully the rumours of getting the band back together for one more trip around the holodeck are true, and we'll get one more blast into the Trekverse.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This album is by far DT's heaviest release, resembling more the style of bands like Metallica, but staying true to their awesome progressive nature.  This is a nice change from their other albums, and the musicianship is great.  My only problem with this album is that the lyrics seem to be so much less sophisticated than their other releases.  Lines like \\"Don't tell me how to win <br />This fight / It isn't your right /To take the only thing that's mine\\" and \\"I'm so far away / And so alone /I need to see your face\\" make Dream Theater's lyricism sadly seem to drop to Linkin Park level standards of marketing to angst-ridden teenagers.  <br /> <br />Having said this, I still don't think that this album is worth missing just because of the lyrics.  Personally I find them much less interesting and deep than other releases, but the music is still great, and with a band like Dream Theater, that's what really counts anyways.

B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets (1986.), Metallica's third studio album<br /><br />The Metallica of the 1980's was one of the main defining bands of thrash metal and of the metal genre as a whole. Drawing from influences of bands such as Motorhead and Iron Maiden, Metallica were one of the first bands (along with Metal Church etc.) to pioneer the thrash style. Metallica's excellent first album, 'Kill 'Em All' had a very raw sound to it; you could say it was thrash at it's purest. The masterpiece 'Ride The Lightning' followed in 1984; another album filled with more untamed aggression but noticably more structured than it's predecessor. Following this, the band returned to the studio to work on a follow up album. What emerged from this, in 1986 was 'Master Of Puppets'. The album has gone on to be regarded as one of the defining moments of thrash metal; frequently topping greatest metal album polls. So does the album really live up to it's monstrous reputation?<br /><br />'Master Of Puppets' is an album that succeeds in practically all areas. With this album, the band developed their style further from what was seen in 'Ride The Lightning'. In structural set-up, this album is similar to it's predecessor - Metallica stuck to a formula in that respect. However aside from this, 'Master Of Puppets' progresses the thrash genre into new territory. The album features plenty of lightning fast riffs, as is the norm in thrash, but the band begin to use even more complex styles to their music (something expanded further in '...And Justice For All') and squeeze in plenty of new ideas. All of the songs on 'Master Of Puppets' are long, ranging from 5 to 8 minutes in length but none of the songs ever lose interest or get boring. This is especially due to the number of different riffs the band put into individual songs on this album. It's literally awesome how the band manage to seemlessly interchange riffs in some of the albums songs - just listen to the smooth but still heavy, bone-crunching transitions in songs such as 'Disposable Heroes' and you'll see what I mean! Furthermore, the album also succeeds amazingly with the themes within the songs. Where 'Ride The Lightning' explored themes of death, 'Master Of Puppets' looks at the misuses of power and the iron-fisted control it involves. The band members of Metallica in the 1980's always said they would stick to real life issues in their music and they managed it excellently. It's kind of ironic and sad that in the 1990's they became everything they once laughed at with their later music - just look at the lyrics on 'The Black Album' for example. Anyway, going back to 'Master Of The Puppets', you see an album which has themes ranging from the sacrifice of soldiers to war to the views of an inmate in an asylum. It's facinating stuff and excellently lyrically executed. All four members of the band play out of their skin on the album - there's some fantastic perfomances. What's mostly noticable is firstly Lars Ulrich's drumming, which has even greater presence on this album and secondly James Hetfield's vocals. By the time of this album, he had perfected his trademark growl and his singing is much more powerful than on the earlier work. Kirk Hammett's solos are diverse, fast and explosive throughout and Cliff Burton gives one of the all-time legendary performances on the bass. Sadly though, it would be his last as he tragically died a few months after the album's release.<br /><br />Metallica's magnum opus kicks of with 'Battery'. The Spanish guitar opening gets things going before the crunching guitar riffs burst in. This is one of the fastest songs on the album and is an amazing opener. It has infectious riffs and great lyrics such as 'Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me'. After 5 minutes of full out onslaught, the opener runs into the title track epic. This song has plenty of complex moments but it never gets boring. The interlude is a clever departure from the song's main style and the commanding chorus is very strong and potent. The mysterious opening 'The Thing That Should Not Be' follows. It took me a while to get into the song, but my persistance was worthwhile. The song's dark, foreboding nature is captivating. Next, to end the first half of the album is 'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'. This is an impressive song, in a similar mold to 'Fade To Black' from 'RTL'. The guitar work is awesome and the lyrics are strikingly powerful, where James Hetfield sings from the viewpoint of an asylum internee, trapped in a world of insanity. The change of pace in the song is great later on also.<br /><br />Then, side 2 of the album kicks off with what is for me, the album's best song in 'Disposable Heroes'. This expressly fast epic has some amazing riffs which all interlock brilliantly. This predominantly anti-war song hits home very strongly. The 'Back To The Front' chorus and crunching guitars are not to be missed. The underrated 'Leper Messiah' follows. The song opens with plodding riffs, with an odd time signature rhythm and a call and response chorus. Then though, the track gathers pace into a fantastic interlude with a great solo from Kirk Hammett and resonating shouts from Hetfield before cleverly decellerating into the original riff. 'Orion' follows. Metallica's instrumentals are by far the most underrated part of their catalogue and this 8 minute work is shows this. The first part of the song features classic Metallica riffs, with powerful bass lines from Cliff Burton. Then though, the song takes an unexpected turn. The next part of the song is then a showcase for all of the band members. A smooth bass line provides the basis for some great Hammett and Hetfield solos before Cliff Burton plays an awesome solo (he makes his bass sound just like a lead guitar!). A phenominal track. Then finally, to finish this classic album, we have 'Damage Inc.'. The song has a sonic, futuristic sounding opening before developing into the fastest song on the album, and one of the best. The riffs are at breakneck speed, the drumming furious and the vocals powerful and aggressive. There's a superb Hammett solos also. This song was so popular amongst fans that the album tour was named after it!<br /><br />'Master Of Puppets' saw Metallica improve even more on their excellent earlier work to come up with another thrash masterpiece. By developing their style in a more complex direction but still maintaining speed and heaviness, the band produced classics in this album and the follow up, 1988's '...And Justice For All'. Sadly though, this was the last Metallica album to feature the 'classic' line up of Metallica due to Cliff Burton's tragic death soon after the album's release. 'Master Of The Puppets' is a definitive album and is a near perfect work. A must for any heavy metal fan's collection; this is Metallica in their golden years.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10and potent.

B0001611DI|5.0|Wow, what a movie! I settled down late last night to watch this classic for the first time, and was highly impressed. The gore effects are brilliant, and it's also very funny. Personally i found none of it scary or particulary freaky, mainly because the makeup for the zombies isn't that good, and obviously low budget. The average zombie is basically covered in blue face paint wearing a torn bloody shirt. However somehow it makes the film better.  <br /> <br />Get it.
0399103422|5.0|Exellent story of the crime world of New Yourk! It takes time to understand the meaning of trust, honor, respect and reveng! Puzo's way of telling this is remarcable. He comes in form of Corleones the ruling family in the states. He doesn't let you cold at any time. Like most mob books the crimes aren`t the guideline for the book! It`s the story of the family. the bond they have to eachother, how nothing can come between them. The gang fight's which had to be taken to protect THE FAMILY.

The  title  \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam\\"  might put off some that lean heavily toward multiculturalism and tolerance, but they are the very ones that should read it. <br /> <br />If one has doubts about the truth or accuracy of many of the   statements that might be considered inflamatory or sensational, there are 23 pages of notes and references to back them up and make them hard for a thinking person to dismiss.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|It was good.  A nice tribute to the show.  Can't bear to give it less than 4 stars, even though there were a few things that I didn't like - like the deaths of certain people, one especially . . . . it just wasn't right.  But then, Joss Whedon has a dirty habit of killing off beloved people in the last \\"episodes\\" of his serieses. And the contention at the beginning between Mal and Simon.  I mean, it was just like, boom, all of the sudden River saving the ship and expressing how she feels about the crew in the last Firefly episode is all but forgotten.  Alas.  But it worked.  Mal finding the thing that could help bring down the Alliance for good was a nice touch - though it would have worked better in a season two ;).  Anyhow, any Firefly fan MUST see Serenity, and any Buffy/Angel fan must see Firefly and then Serenity (Otherwise it makes less sense)!
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Former Saturday Night Live funnyman Will Ferrell left the weekly comedy routine for good to focus all his attention on the big screen. Though he has done a couple of films, the release of \\"Elf\\" embarks as his first Christmas adventure. <br />  <br />Ferrell was known for playing as hyper, nitwitted, and downright unpredictable on SNL, which director Jon Favreau (best known as the writer and star of \\"Swingers\\") implements in \\"Elf.\\" <br />  <br /> <br />Thirty years later after a baby happen to crawl inside Santa's (Ed Asner) toy bag, things turn silly as full-grown Buddy (Ferrell) stand much more taller among fellow elves in the North Pole. The camerawork make the regular size people play as elves appear much shorter compare to Ferrell, in fact it'd be easy to mistake him as The Jolly Green Giant.  <br /> <br />Ferrell finds his comedic zone when his character goes across country to reunite with his real father (James Caan). Foreign to anywhere outside the North Pole, Buddy behaves as he would at home.  <br /> <br />How he acts while floundering around in NEW York will make you laugh. Just by looking at Buddy's retarded wide-eye glare should cause anyone to laugh out loud.  You won't know what to expect. The most hilarious scene of all has to be the off-tempo song he sings to his father:  <br /> <br />\\"I am here with my dad and we never met and he wants me to sing him a song. And I was adopted but you didn't know I was born. So I am here now. I found you daddy. And Guess what? I love you, I love you, I love you!\\"  <br /> <br />Throughout most of the movie Buddy is unable to bridge the gap with his long-lost father. Apparently, saying he wants to go ice-skating, eat sugar plumbs and hold hands with his father doesn't help bring the two closer. <br />  <br />Caan plays as a Manhattan children's book publisher. His son (Daniel Tay) doesn't like how his dad only cares for making money. Is there hope that the Christmas spirit can change him? <br />  <br />Of Course \\"Elf\\"wouldn't be a Christmas story without involving a love interest. Jovie (Zooey Deschand) meets Buddy in the mall. At first impression she ignores his goofed-ball, retard personality. Buddy antagonized her until she gave him a chance.  <br /> <br />The rambling Christmas carol sung toward the end was gruesome to sit through. There's nothing wrong for carolers to sing in light of the Christmas spirit, but it came out horrible in this movie and the choir takes a serious approach to sound musical and family orientated when in fact it sounds utterly fake. <br />   <br />Ultimately, Ferrell fans should enjoy this Christmas comedy.  <br />
B00005JOIF|3.0|According to Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Steven Spielberg commissioned three scripts for MUNICH: one from David Webb Peoples and Janet Peoples, one from Charles Randolph, and one from Eric Roth. Roth's script was chosen and subsequently revised by Tony Kushner. But he needent have bothered. Instead investing in so many writers and buying the movie rights to George Jonas' book \\"Vengeance,\\" Spielberg should have simply used the script from the made-for-TV SWORD OF GIDEON.  <br /> <br />Even though seven out of ten professional critics rave about Steven Spielberg's MUNICH, for me it was a big disappointment. That's because I had seen its forgotten predecessor, SWORD OF GIDEON made for HBO cable TV in 1986. <br /> <br />Spielberg's movie was a frustrating dj vu experience because it had clearly followed much of the SWORD OF GIDEON story. Both movies were based George Jonas' book \\"Vengeance.\\" But MUNICH lacks the excitement and especially character development of the SWORD OF GIDEON. Oddly enough, none of the \\"professional\\" movie critics seemed to have recognized that MUNICH is seemingly a failed remake of SWORD OF GIDEON. Accordingly, the two movies must be compared -- here. <br /> <br />MUNICH is not such a terrible movie but it simply doesn't come up to Spielberg's usual standards. Based on actual events, the movie begins with and often flashes back to the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre of eleven Israeli athletes and coaches. Palestinian terrorists broke into the Olympic village in Munich and captured several Israeli athletes. After the German police tried to intervene, the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists, most of whom were also killed. <br /> <br />Prime Minister Golda Meir's Israeli government is horrified and quickly set plans into motion for punishing those who had planned and executed the massacre. Israel had always denied putting an assassination plan into action. But what happens next is the way legends tell it. <br /> <br />In the movie, anassassination team of dedicated men is assigned to avenge the athlete's deaths. A rather young Avner (flatly played by Eric Bana) is ambiguously introduced as a government bureaucrat who is chosen to lead the team, albeit he is a married man with a pregnant wife. Avner is controlled by Mossad's Ephraim (fairly convincingly acted by Geoffrey Rush). Avner and his team are given a dangerous, secret mission requiring hard hearts and nerves of steel. They must locate, hunt down and kill the architects of the Munich Olympic Massacre -- and never put anyone else into danger. <br /> <br />Spielberg's hopeless effort to be fair to both the Israeli hit squad and also the Palestinian terrorists is a major weakness of MUNICH. At times, Spielberg lets the Palestinians state their case. But given the circumstances of the massacre in Munich, this is impossible. Indeed, by the movie trying to be fair it waters down the anti-terrorism message which the film seems to present.  <br /> <br />Just imagine a movie trying to give the 19 mostly Saudis who carried out the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the U.S. a platform for presenting THEIR case. Maybe for trying to clearly assert his anti-terroist position, Spielberg's closing scene dwells on a panoramic view of New York City's skyline; focusing our attention on the the 1970s twin World Trade Center -- smack in the middle of the screen. <br /> <br />Eric Bana plays Avner singularly uncharismatically. Neither Bana's role in BLACK HAWK DOWN nor as THE INCREDIBLE HULK showed good acting skills. Maybe in (the Brad Pitt) movie TROY in which Bana plays Hector, he generated empathy from the audience. But not in MUNICH. Also, Spielberg only let the Avner undergo character changes in the last 15-20 minutes of MUNICH. So then maybe Bana's unsympathetic Avner isn't completely the actor's fault. <br /> <br />MUNICH can be considered an important movie because of its subject, and because it was made by Steven Spielberg -- maybe. But the disjointed -- sometimes illogical -- scenes, emotional coldness of the movie, the silliness of trying to treat both the Palestinians and Israelis evenhandedly, plus a not very attractive lead actor makes this one of Spielberg's worst movies. Sorry. <br /> <br />Director Michael Anderson's the SWORD OF GIDEON (he also made AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, 1956; MILLENNIUM, 1989), like Spielberg's MUNICH, is based on George Jonas' book \\"Vengeance.\\" But, by contrast, Anderson's script and direction are excellent. Plus with such familiar and well-seasoned actors as Rod Steiger, Michael York, and Colleen Dewhurst the SWORD OF GIDEON is exceptionally well cast. The cinematography is also excellent with stunning scenes from locations in Israel, London, and all across Europe. <br /> <br />In SWORD OF GIDEON, Avner (played by the then sexy and sympathetic Steven Bauer) is a skilled commando leader in the Israeli army. Indeed, the movie opens with Avner leading a practice raid in the desert that devastates an \\"enemy\\" fortress. We get an early sampling of Avner's deadly yet nice guy bravery. Also, he is the son of an embittered former government agent (convincingly played by John Hirsch).  <br /> <br />As in Spielberg's version, Mossad (Israel's version of the CIA), secretly aided by Golda Meir and her cookies and tea, recruits Avner as a counter-terrorist. His contact, Mossad's Mordechai (Rod Steiger) recommends him to lead an international hit squad to kill the terrorists who had master minded the 1972 Olympic Massacre in Munich. <br /> <br />Although Avner is made leader (the only combat-hardened soldier), others on the Jewish assassination squad have a lot more espionage experience. An Englishman Robert (Michael York) is an expert in explosives, the Frenchman Jean (Laurent Malet) is a professional race car driver, the sensitive German Hans (Robert Joy) is an experienced hit man, while the older German Carl (Peter Dvorsky) is the \\"sweeper\\" who removes all the evidence from their hits. <br /> <br />Colleen Dewhurst briefly, perfectly plays Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. Leslie Hope plays Avner's attractive, pregnant wife. Maybe SWORD OF GIDEON tries too hard to get sympathy for Avner's hit squad with its excessive hand wringing and remorseful dialogue. They not only mourn their fallen comrades but also weep for their targets' families. But Mossad's Mordechai (played with creepy cynicism by Steiger) comes across as a sinister, cold-blooded character. Mordechai is probably an amalgam of several real life Mossad leaders. <br /> <br />A very serious deficiency in Spielberg's movie is completely neglecting Avner's relationsip with his father -- convincingly played by John Hirsch in SWORD OF GIDEON. When Avner's father learns that Avner took the Mossad assignment, he becomes extremely angry and alienated: \\"You'll see! They'll screw you the same way they screwed me!\\"  But then -- still the loving father -- he gives Avner the name and telephone number of a French \\"asset\\" who's simply called Papa, in case Avner needs \\"special\\" help in Paris. \\"You must always have at least one Joker up your sleeve when you work for the Mossad. Papa is that Joker,\\" warns Avner's father. <br /> <br />In Spielberg's MUNICH the French Papa occupies a pivotal role, but  he are never allows us to know how Avner, his father and the French informant are connected. We never learn in MUNICH that the French Papa owes a very big favor to Avner's father (who had rotted in prison instead of Papa). That's why Papa shocks his own spook team by bending the rules of espionage for Avner.  <br /> <br />In MUNICH there is a lot of dialogue between Avner and Papa about loyalty to one's father and family. But without knowing the relationship among the three men, Papa's all knowing, dramatic speech is totally out of context. At a critical point in Spielberg's film, a very nervous Avner asks Papa (without getting an answer), \\"How did you know my name?\\" How indeed?! [you'd have to see SWORD OF GIDEON to find out!] <br /> <br />The scenes in SWORD OF GIDEON are filled with mounting tension, especially when the explosives expert Robert is checking out their safe house in Paris for booby traps. Despite its minor limitations (maybe the result of its made-for-TV), SWORD OF GIDEON is a spy thriller with a lot greater intelligence than most of the others in this genre -- including MUNICH. <br /> <br />When it comes to telling the story of Israel's retalation for the 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre, the SWORD OF GIDEON is pure white knuckles suspense while MUNICH is simply banal. <br /> <br />

0307276902|5.0|(We rate all of our books five stars) <br />The book was not good enough to be picked up as a novel. It failed at 17 houses- big and small- including ours. Gang rapes, root canals, and suicides dont cut it in fiction. They're too trite and easy. But when they happen to people in real life, everyone pays attention. Its riveting. The solution was obvious. Pretend its real and market it that way. It will sell, sell, sell!  <br />Fact: <br />This book got picked up by one of the biggest houses (if I don't say so myself) after it was marketed as non fiction. <br />
1400079276|4.0|Like a few reviewers have said, I thought the first half of the story was great but something was lacking in the second half. Perhaps it's the venture into the spiritual realm that got some readers, me included, frustrated in the second half. A big part of Japanese culture is the belief in the spirit of animate and inanimate objects -- every object has a spirit within and they can travel to multiple realms, including the one inhabited by humans. This perhaps could explain the wierdness experienced by non-Japanese readers when reading about the spiritual realm of things.<br /><br />Many things, mostly the metaphysical, are discussed in Kafka on the Shore. But the one thing that was stressed on near the end of the novel is: memories. What defines us as humans are our individual memories and experiences. Our memories are what made each one of us different. For all of us, these memories can be painful to recall or bring sweetness to our lives. People with bad memories tend to view life negatively and question the meaning of their life: if life is bad and causing me to have painful memories, why do I go on living? The answer is: To keep the spirits of our loved ones alive. The dead are gone and they have no memories -- it's like they never existed. By remembering them, even if it's painful for us, we keep them alive. Hence we must keep on living for as long as we can to keep our loved ones alive. This is what I think Murakami is trying to say.
B000002KON|5.0|This album, along with Village Green Preservation Society, marked the highwater point for the Kinks.  Ray Davies was in full bloom during that late 60's period in a way in which he has rarely been since. He had found his voice, and was at the top of his form.  On Arthur, almost every song works.  Ray seems to have been born to write a song like Victoria.  Who else would ever have written such a rockin' tribute to Queen Victoria?  In 1969?  (No wonder this didn't sell at the time.)  Shangri-La is one of Davies' best Everyman songs.  He takes the theme to an almost epic level in the song, and succeeds.  She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina is a hoot; Ray's willingness to be preposterous in those days was a definite asset.  One could go on.    The compassion & loopy humor that inform Ray's best work were never more evident than on this album.  It holds up well more than 35 years later.  Highly recommended.
B00000099Y|2.0|Disclaimer; to all Tool fans reading this review, relax. To all fans who complain about one star reviews, don't bother; it's all a matter of taste. It's important to remember that you are not better than me because you like this album; and it's important for me to remember that I am not better than you for disliking this album. It's all a matter of taste, and all a matter of opinion. Also, saying I don't \\"get\\" Tool, that their music is too \\"complex\\" for me, too \\"intelligent\\" for me, and that it goes \\"over my head\\" need to know that i love Frank Zappa and King Crimson, both of whom are much more complex than Tool ever got. Thank you. <br /> <br />I give this album two stars because it has two songs on it; Hooker With A Penis and Aenima. These are very catchy songs, and very entertaining. Above all very short. From now on, time restraints did not exist in the world of Tool.  <br /> <br />I also give them props for the goofy jokes Harry Manback and Dier Von Satan. Those are geniunely funny. However, those props kind of lose their well, propability when one examines the other \\"nonsong\\" tracks, and runs into record needle feedback, a baby crying, and four minutes of shaking sheet metal. Experimentation indeed; it's too(l) bad that the band didn't incorporate this sort of 1915 sonic experimentation into their actual songs. <br /> <br />As for the songs, they generally suffer from overlength; an average Aenima song has many musical ideas as a general Undertow song. However, the musical ideas are better, so even if they're stretched out, they're balanced by the fact that they're better. So in the end, the album balances out to be roughly even with Undertow. <br /> <br />Danny Carrey needs to get out of Tool and find a better band. His amazing drumming is what propels the band and makes it interesting; Adam Jones needs to go back to special effects work, as his \\"three-barre-chord-riffs-right-on-top-of-each-other-on-the-frets-up-down-up-down\\" guitar playing, combined with his\\"Uh, I can't play solo's so let's throw on a lot of distortion and effects to trick everybody\\" style is very wearing.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are typical maynard garbage. <br /> <br />So two good songs, followed by typical Tool garbage. Greatest album ever, indeed.
068987474X|5.0|I think most women already know about this language barrier, or behaviour barrier, or do we? I don't think we want to know most of the time. Maybe it is more comforting, in the short term, to think that a promised call REALLy means that he is busy, gone to china, or dropped dead on his way to call us. It is probably no surprise to finally know that was not the case. I am so happy that Greg wrote this book. I think it is about time we all say what we mean, and mean what we say!! How idealistic of me!! <br />Happy reading!!
B0007ZAL66|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD versions, but I did have the VHS one. I found it a very moving film.  <br /> <br />But what has grabbed me ever since 1992 about this movie was the Vangelis soundtrack. It is FANTASTIC! Along with his Blade Runner, Chariots of Fire and Antarctica soundtracks, this truly stands in contrast and in uniformity... classic Vangelis through the decades of his career. Then for those albums that should have been soundtracks... The City, Soil Festivities, Voices, Oceanic, El Greco, Mythodea... there is even a webring for the guy's music.  <br /> <br />Go for it! The music will carry you away to far distant shores, even if the film doesn't. <br />
B000001EYW|5.0|\\"Still Waters\\" has no musical flaws in my eyes and ears.  My three favorites \\"Closer Than Close\\" has the late Maurice heading the vocals and he is so good.  The special harmonies that weave through it are soothing and reminiscent of the young Gibbs boys. \\"Alone is a right-on song with a wistful premise and \\"Still Waters Run Deep\\" is another example of the BeeGees magic at haunting musical background and just the right lyric.

B000BYA5GO|5.0|There are a lot of critical reviews regarding the fact that the movie isn't as funny as some would like, or because \\"the message\\" isn't exactly what they want it to be.  But, this is a great movie.  As a story, it does a good job of dragging the viewer into the protagonist's head.  The shocking thing, that many reviewers don't like, is that Ury is kinda nuts.  He just doesn't \\"get\\" other people, probably because he doesn't care about them like a normal person.  This guy's passion is the rush he gets from trading arms.  Although, there is a lot of ambiguity about exactly what Ury's thinking.  That's part of story.  Just how far gone is this guy?<br /><br />Basically, this is a solid movie about an upleasant topic with a plot twist at the end.  Very graphic, fair amount of action, good script, strong acting in the important roles, and some very dark humor.  If you have a very dark sense of humor or are looking for a hard-hitting drama, this film is excellent.<br /><br />The plot itself is straightforward (guy becomes int'l arms dealer and faces unique career and family issues along the way), but the ending will be surprising to most people.  Although well foreshadowed, it is also well-concealed.  It's one of those things that will make you re-think a ton of what came before, like \\"Fight Club.\\"  I don't understand why some reviewers think the portrayal is so innaccurate.  Ury had lots of help, but the structure of his organization isn't so important.  In fact, Ury could have taken a very personal approach to sales, that is a typical feature of the Russian mob and makes them hard to catch.<br /><br />I can see that the movie wasn't as funny as the trailers implied.  It was funny at times, but ultimately the movie is a tragedy.  I suspect that a few of the jokes were so dark that many people just didn't find them humorous.  For example, there is a scene where a customer shoots a guy for no apparent reason.

B000AP2ZLC|5.0|How much more of a perfect release could Cryptopsy have wanted? This CD is amazing. The first time you listen to it you are just completely stunned, taking a few minutes to try and comprehend the technical perfection you have just experienced. I'm a Lord Worm fan, so having him back on vocals was good enough. Flo, the man with 80 arms and legs, takes his drumming to so much of an insane level that it's hard to even put it into words. Take what he did on None So Vile, multiply that times 10 and maybe you have it. There's no need to go into each song: they are equally 10 out of 10 masterpieces. Sound quality on this recording is sick! It's one of those CD's that's so loud and clear while still having that raw edge that makes all Death Metal the most extreme music in the universe. Once Was Not WILL go down as THE technical Death Metal release that all others will be compared to. Only one (in my opinion) that comes close is None So Vile. Don't even think about getting this one, just do it. All Hail Cryptopsy!!! <br /> Necrosoul.
B000001OAA|4.0|I first heard about Garbage about 7 years ago, when they came out with the song 'Special'. The song had appeared on a 'Now' CD and at the time, I had really enjoyed the song. Unfortunately at the time, I was also eleven, and was too immersed in Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys to go out and buy a Garbage CD. Now many years later I've rediscovered the alternative rock genre that was going on when I was a kid in the '90s. Since I enjoyed the song 'Only Happy When It Rains' I decided to buy Garbage's debut CD on a whim. I'm pretty glad I did, because one of the miracles about this CD is there is hardly any filler at all. Almost every song probably had the potential to become a hit single. Garbage combined a lot of the elements that were being used in the '90s alt rock genre: sassy female singer, catchy hooks, grunge-sounding guitars, and bitter lyrics. The album starts off with 'Supervixen' a unqiue and empowering song that has interesting stop/start noises. 'Queer' undermines exactly what it means to be an outcast. 'Only Happy When It Rains' was the big hit from this album, a very tongue-in cheek song about the depression state of the '90s. 'As Heaven is Wide' has some of the most clever lyrics: 'As far from god/as heaven is wide/as far from god/as angels can fly. 'Not my Idea' is extremely catchy and Shirely Manson is able to pull off singing 'Dut dut dut dut dut dut do' without sounding corny. 'Dog New Tricks' is an empowering rocker while 'My Lover's Box' is longing and self-pitying. The closing track 'Milk' is haunting and longing, a great way to end the album. In short, if you are looking for an album that offers more than just the radio singles released, then I highly recommend this album.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|I was driving the other day listening to the song \\"Chicago,\\" and through my rear-view mirror I saw two girls riding a vespa were behind me zooming through the frosty streets. The morning light poured onto their faces as they pointed and laughed as they held each other to keep warm. It was a perfect moment with a perfect song, and reminded me why I like music so much in the first place. This is one of those albums that will quickly become a classic. <br /> <br />With that said, sometimes this album feels a bit overlong, and you'd really have to be in a Sufjan Stevens mood to listen to it all the way through. Part of me wishes that it had 10 or 12 songs rather than 17, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because they're really great songs. Recommended.

B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes came onto the music scene with their album, The Strokes - Is This It, quickly becoming one of the Top 10 best reviewed bands of the millenium (Their album stands at number 10 on the All-Time High list of [...] These indie-rockers were compared to the likes of The Velvet Underground and were garnering attention from big critics for their retro-garage sound, carefree music &honest lyrics. The album sold in the millions.<br /><br />With their second album, The Strokes - Room on Fire, the band did it again. The hooks were still there. The precise sound. The raw music. Yet, the critics were not as excited about it as its predecessors. Nor was the public. While I enjoyed their latter album more than their debut, The Strokes, departed their former style with their new album, First Impressions of Earth. While searching for a new sound, The Strokes, however, get muddled in aggressive riffs and mumbled lyrics. Many people will be turned off at first, but after several plays, the listener will become more fond of the album. While their hooks are no longer apparent, if you have been a fan of this band in the past, this album will be well recieved. It is not on the same level of their two previous albums, but it is an above average record. In a month or two, many will forget about this album and do not expect to see it on any yearend lists. But for now, this album should satiate the masses. Well until the new We Are Scientists album comes out next week.<br /><br />Grade : B- (81)<br /><br />Download : The Strokes - Electricityscape, The Strokes - RazorBlade, The Strokes - Ask Me Anything<br /><br />Skip It : The Strokes - Evening Sun, The Strokes - 15 Minutes Of Pain, The Strokes - Killing Lies
0307276902|5.0|I loved the book.But like I say in my title Time doesn't equal recovery.Thats what James has is time. He has to be working some kiond od program to have recovery.I know everyone is flipping out because he lied in it. But people have to remember we are human not saints. You have to admit James has come a long way from where he started.  My thing was about the 12 step stuff. I just wish he didn't put that stuff in at all. He really didn't need it. We got the point he didn't want AA. But, maybe someone who needs the 12 steps (like me for one) needed him to at least validate it.I have been in and around the rooms of the fellowship for a while I have a few 24 hours in and it(AA/NA) helped me.I once heard a speaker at a convention tell me Recovery is a super highway NA is just one of the lanes.People use all kinds of ways to get clean. But as James is finding out lying damn sure isn't going to keep him clean.

0307276902|5.0|This book is incredible, I finished it just before the media frenzy about the \\"lies.\\" Parts of it may be embellished, but that makes it no less of a page-turner. Frey has said that he wrote things how he remembers them, when you're on drugs and recovering, things sometimes seem different than they actually are. All the people criticizing him have most likely never been addicted to drugs, and therefore don't understand what truly goes on in the mind of an addict. I applaud James Frey for having the guts to write this book, whether it is 100% true or not.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Two really good laughs & thats it.  This is one of those films you're told that \\"...you've gotta see it!\\"  Trust me you don't!  I should have know better when I saw the Mtv logo.  Mtv hasn't brought anything good to the table in over 15 years.

B0001CNRS4|5.0|I found this movie to be upbeat and also uplifting . It deals with Jessica Alba as a Hip Hop Dance Instuctor at a local Community Center and she is a Godsend to the inner city youth . She is genuially interested in providing a safe place for young people to go and dance ,  have fun as well as make the community a better place to be . This movie was Choreographed by Laurie Ann Gibson one of the best Choreographers in the Indusrty so you will definitly see some great moves and tight routines , i give this movie 5 stars.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|Why the hype machine of the Matrix churns on.  The Matrix as art has been overlooked.  Taken as a whole this collection does, shows us that the Matrix story is the story of humanity at the dawn of the 21st century.  The question of reality, humanity, life and existence are the questions of the day.  At no time in human history have we as humans had to question our own existence.  The ten disc collection brings it all home.  While there are arguments the the two follow up movies (especially \\"The Matrix Revolution\\") fell short of moviegoing expectations, the complete collection fills in the gaps.  The absolute best past of the collection is the commentary from the philosopers.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I am not really a country fan, never really listened to Johnny Cash or June Carter, wasn't really sure I wanted to see this movie, but when a friend of mine called me at the last minute to join her in seeing this film, I reluctantly agreed.  <br />Not knowing anything about the life of Johnny Cash, I didn't really know what to expect, but from the moment the movie started to the moment it ended, I was riveted. The onscreen performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were dynamic, nothing forced or false. The story line and acting captured the emotion and feeling of the time and lives of these people. The music was entertaining and might actually have made a fan out of me. I haven't felt this satisfied about a movie in a very long time. It is well worth the time and money to see this movie at least once. I'm looking forward to the Oscar results. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|System of A Down has always been one of those bands that has never had to worry about talent because even crap can be popular now too!  I guess if ranting over the microphone in what is the worst conceived metal band ever then this nutjob frontman has what it takes.  I'm going to just throw a few good rock cd's out there and maybe you'll do yourself a favor and pick one up... <br />     Into the Heavy? : the new American Headcharge, Blindside, Hotwire, and yes...Slipknot is still acceptable. <br />     Into Rock? : Breaking Point's new release, Cold's \\"A Different Kind Of Pain\\", or Jonah33's new cd \\"The Strangest Day\\"
B000BEZQ18|3.0|This is a great album for some nostalgic songs by really great artists of the last half of the 20th century (Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt).  Also, the original score songs are full versions of limited clips that appear in the movie (which are naturally there as background to the cinemagraphic experience).   <br />I really like tracks 10 and 11 (\\"I don't want to say goodbye\\" and \\"I will never let you go\\").  They are both fun country-western ditties that are easy on the ears and quick to pick up if you like to sing along.  Track 4 (\\"A love that will never grow old\\") by Bernie Taupin and Emmylou Harris is fabulous and haunting like the movie; however, it's not my personal favorite for casual listening (leaves you depressed...like the movie). <br />I think you'll like this album to rip to your ipod and other devices; but, remember it's a true movie score and not a casual listening album.  Rip the songs you like and play them over and over again. Save the whole original CD to pull out every now and listen to when you're in a nostalgic mood to remember the whole movie experience.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Stargate Atlantis started a little slow but developed into a very good show.  I thought there was no way I would enjoy Atlantis as much as I enjoy Starget SG-1 but I was wrong.  I find I look forward to this show as much as the other.  The producer, director and writers did a very good job establishing a separate identify from SG-1, developed a good story line and character development.  Great job considering what they were faced with!
6305428220|5.0|the faculty is definently a guilty pleasure. combining the classic aliens invade earth scenerio with a hip teen vibe put into the mix, kevin williamsen and robert rodriguez then mix it into a fun ride with clever humor, creepy aliens, and tons of water. all the while biulding up the suspense and parinoa. the film is about six high school students each diffrent in everyway who begin to suspect there teachers are not from this world and soon they find out about this alien that takes over humans, think of it like a invasion of the body snatchers scenerio. now they must stop this thing from being unleashed to the whole world. both sides deliver good characters from the faculty of stars like famke janssen, selma hayek, and the terminator guy along with the six students but its obvious that duvall and wood steal the show. good movie to watch on a off day, it will really give you that sense that maybe your teachers arent what they seem.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Andrew Niccol, who both directed and wrote the screenplay for Lord of War, has made an engaging, interesting movie.  In the end, unhappily, its main message is corrupted and fails.    Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performances playing Yuri Orlov, a self-absorbed loner turned arms merchant.  The movie's tension revolves around the duplicity and mendacity of Yuri.  He has a trophy wife, wooed by lies and money.  He has a younger brother whose drug addiction and unhappiness arise from being co-opted by Yuri into helping with the arms dealing; his depression is enhanced by Yuri's strange doses of misdirected brotherly love.  Tension grows as we wonder:  Will Yuri give up arms dealing, and become the person his family needs?  Will we discover what motivates Yuri, and men like him, to deal arms in the midst of the savagery and death that he is selling?    This story is well done, and is compelling viewing.  But Niccol goes too far in portraying Yuri as an isolated loner, traveling the world with no more than his brother at his right arm, and his quick wits as his guide.  This portrayal clearly settles into fantasy land:  a actual multimillionaire gun-runner like Yuri could not travel the world without lawyers, accountants, strong-arm men, etc., a complete retinue, gang, mini-mafia of people that would take care of details, such as keeping Interpol agents well away from their affairs.      The rub for Lord of War is that the crucial story cannot be that of Yuri, as interesting as it is portrayed.  Niccol and the viewers cannot escape the awful realities about arms dealing, and the message about governments that not only turn a blind's eye, but actively participate.  The movie ends strong, and hits all these notes hard.  But by this time, Niccol has lost credibility with his portrayal of Yuri.  Fantasy does not belong here, and we know it.  Lord of War is flawed in its essence, and that is very disappointing.  Our times needed Niccol to be better.  Lord of War should have been so much more important than it is.
6305308659|5.0|I love this movie. Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are great! The movie has many hidden meanings or reaches ppl on differnt levels, however you like to take it. Either way, it is definately worth watching at least once, and i on the other hand, had to own it. Great movie!
B0000025DV|5.0|I remember the first time I listened to \\"Out of the blue\\". I can recall a feeling of being completely alive. Yes, this is where it's at. The only CD I had before from the band was \\"Strange Magic\\", a best of CD. But that did not prepare me for what was to come in \\"Out of the blue\\".  <br /> It's all too clear on this CD that Jeff Lynne does nothing half stepping. The blood, sweat and tears of this masterpiece shows. You feel rewarded. That is the greatness of ELO, they pack a punch in every song they make, that it exhausts you to a high of satisfaction. <br /> Each song has its own brand and flavor. \\"Turn to stone\\", soars in like if from out of the blue. (No Pun intended.) With its greatness and rousing introduction to this CD, it gives you the feeling of something mastery at play and yet to come. <br /> A lovely classical piano takes control on \\"It's over\\". As if Debussy and Rachmaninov had invited you over to share in a sad moment of a break up, that the singer tries to convince of his own self of what is already obvious, but still inconceivable. <br /> Of all the songs here, \\"Sweet talkin' woman\\" steals the show. The orchestration here would have put a smile on Mozart's face. The song in whole is crisp and solid, Restraint but daring. It is most defiantly an ELO classic. <br /> \\"Across the border\\" has the sounds of a Mexican mariachi band. <br /> \\"Night in the city\\" and \\"Sweet is the Night\\" are lovely songs that have the lyrics stealing the show. The latter: (\\"In your city dress you stand and stare, and you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair.) <br /> \\"Starlight\\" gives you the feeling of lying in an open field, where like the lyrics, \\"The stars are looking down on me so far away.\\" It reminds you of a great big forgotten universe that surrounds us still. <br /> \\"Jungle\\" shows again how Jeff Lynne can bring to life a surrealistic world where jungle animals invite you to dance and sing along with them in honor of a \\"wondrous great blue ship that sails around  the mighty sun.\\" as they give \\"joy to every one that rides along\\". <br /> .\\"Believe me now\\" is a short piece that gives you the feeling of being launched into space. <br /> Once again Lynne pulls on your heart strings on the song \\"Steppin' out\\". Leaving you with an optimistic unsurely feeling of breaking threw to new grounds. <br /> \\"Standin' in the rain\\", \\"Big wheels\\", \\"Summer and Lightning \\"and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\", play out on their own. It's Reminiscent of a Beethoven symphony. It is intense, sad, frustrating, but in the end, beautifully Uplifting.\\" <br /> \\"The Whale\\" is an instrumental piece, with a backdrop of whale cries, which give you a peaceful feeling of the beauty of this senselessly harmed mammal. <br /> \\"Birmingham Blues\\" shows you that no matter how deep ELO can be, they still know how to put down a rock song just as moving as any other band out there. <br /> \\"Wild west hero\\" (my personal favorite of the CD.), Packs in an old time Scott Joplin like piano, straight out of an old time west saloon. It also has one of Lynne's most heart-felt, out of the gut-wrenching vocals you would ever want to hear over and over again. <br /> It's sad when you have critics downing this CD or ELO. These same people have a one sided mind and fail to grasp that Electric Light Orchestra does not fall just into their one precious category of rock music. ELO is the expansion and possibilities of what could be in music. Inviting you to open your eyes and feel refreshed and put away far from the same routines of soulless, mindless and heartless music.  <br /> Don't pass this CD by. The experience of listening to \\"Out of the Blue\\" will have a lasting impression on you for a good while. <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book is one of the most compelling I've ever read, though as it turns out, it's not a true story at all but essentially a work of fiction.  Don't let that stop you--many of the greatest works of all time have been novels!   This book thrusts you right into the world of drug addiction in a more interesting, complex way than, for example, \\"Bright Lights, Big City.\\"  And my high school students (I'm an English teacher) are loving this text--even the non-readers.  When I read this book a couple of weeks ago, I had no idea it was an \\"Oprah\\" pick--one of my students suggested that I read it.  I can't praise the content, style, and overall brilliance of this book enough; it will keep you up at night reading.  Don't worry if it's true or not: just enjoy it.

0671799320|5.0|Reading \\"The Prize\\" is no easy feat, and it is certainly not your typical Sunday afternoon engagement. But the book's volume is testament both the complexity of the subject with which it is preoccupied as it is to the author's willingness to approach it with sufficient detail to do it justice (and the book's references are a great guide for further reading). After all, the story of oil begins in America almost a century and a half ago, and, in the meantime, fascinates entrepreneurs, politicians, strategists, economists, and, increasingly, consumers who care about the price on the pump and of the heating oil to keep the house warm. To put all this in a single narrative is no small task; and yet Daniel Yergin succeeds admirably, and it is no wonder that he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his effort. <br /> <br />What makes \\"The Prize\\" a great book is that it is a great read; it is sufficiently attuned to the broader history that it gives the reader a sense of perspective and purpose--it offers a continuous idea of how the part fits in the whole. But Mr. Yergin's talents extend beyond his ability to make sense out of a complicated story; it is refreshing to read his book combine politics and economics in a coherent and understandable fashion; to read him navigate through various historical and political settings, whether that is turn-of-the-century America, conservative Saudi Arabia or revolutionary Iran. And yet the richness of the story is to be found in anecdotes--the brief glimpses which reveal so much in so little space, whether that is insight into a personality or a window into a historical moment. <br /> <br />If making sense of a disparate story is the book's chief goal, the need to do so is the book's real significance. Our current preoccupations--whether regarding the price of oil, or the search for alternative energy sources, or the instability of the regions which produce oil--are rather old, about as old as oil itself. In a way, this offers comfort--itis always good to read that previous alarms have proven largely false. But it is also a warning to avoid simplistic ways out--if nothing else, \\"The Prize\\" offers a wealth of information which can put oil in a historic context. Reading it will prove not only educational, but it will also help a reader distinguish between the serious and the silly in the public debates on the future of energy in general and oil in particular.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Right off the top I'll say that I love a movie that really moves me and wrings out my emotions.  Everyone can use a good little cry now and then, and Ron Howard has a way of delivering.<br /><br />There are several powerful things about this movie that make it work.<br /><br />The first is, of course, the fact that it's based on a true story.  There is nothing like knowing there are real human hearts behind the drama on the screen to really draw you in.<br /><br />The second is the stunning cast.  Russell Crowe is amazing as the menatlly tortured John Nash, the mathematical genius whose work changes the face of economic theory, yet who finds himself crippled by schizophrenia.  Russell plays the paranoid schizophrenic doctor with poignancy and an intense vulnerability.  Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as his wife, Alicia, who has to make the decision whether to stand by him and fight, or find more placid life of her own.  She plays the part with such love and openness that when she goes into the bathroom and screams in frustration, you feel it deep within your soul.  The supporting cast, including such distinguished talent as Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer, is just as brilliant, bringing the story together with skill.<br /><br />The third is the method in which the story is told.  Warning, if you haven't seen it, do NOT read most of the reviews below.  They will spoil one of the most important aspects of the story that is critical to identifying with John Nash's quandry.  Suffice to say that Ron Howard does the job and you will be delighted.<br /><br />This movie is wonderful and inspiring.  If I had one gripe, it would be that I would like to have seen a little more of his day to day coping, when it comes to that.  As it is, though, you feel every little bit of pain, anguish, and joy throughout this gorgeous biopic.
B00005O5UJ|5.0|Jethro Tull's 1971 classic....when  I hear this CD it gives the image of a low budget Sci-Fi Movie.....and that's not meant to be rude, that's meant as a compliment to J-Tull....This is one of my absolute favourite Tull CDs along with Minstrel In The Gallery....Pure Theatrics and deserves its rightful place next to The Who's 'Tommy'.......2 words to describe this CD.....ABSOLUTE CLASSIC
B000002J1O|5.0|At the time of this writing, this album is number two on the ProgArchives.com Most Popular Album List. It is the finest of the Gabriel era Genesis albums. While the earlier albums of this era generally showed great genius, this album didn't seem rushed and sloppy.<br /><br />This album also has a personal connection for me. My first concert I went to was Genesis at Princeton University during the 1971-1972 school year when I was around 13 years old. I enjoyed the concert so much that I dragged my mother and my younger sister to their return during the following year. While those days are very long ago now and seen through the sands of time, I seem to remember hearing the opening song of the album at one of those two concerts, with slides of a knight being displayed.<br /><br />As has been mentioned previously, the album is tied together with one theme, that of the decline of the English Empire. But the theme isn't labored by the album. I didn't realize what had tied the album together until I thought about other reviews of the album. But once the theme has been noticed, the theme strengthens the album and the unconscious links between the songs are brought into the light.<br /><br />Dancing With The Moonlit Knight starts off plaintively, with Peter Gabriel asking (a cappella) \\"Can you tell me where my country lies.\\" The rest of the album consists of observations of the psychic location of England.<br /><br />Much has been said (mostly disparagingly) about Phil Collins' vocals on More Fool Me. While the song is an acoustic song, which seems thin in comparison with the stronger orchestrations of the other songs, it provides both a break for the listener, and a potentially commercial song, a requirement for an album both then and now. But as you listen to the song after noting the theme tying the rest of the album together, a reassessment of the song seems called for. Is this a song about being dumped, or is it a song about being left behind by your country?<br /><br />All in all this is a brilliant album, well deserving its place in the annals of Progressive Rock.r /> <br />All in all this is a brilliant album, well deserving its place in the annals of Progressive Rock.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|For lack of a better intro, over the top says it all. For anyone who came of musical age in this period, this is the quintessential tune collection. I might even go as far to say that without this collection, Miami Steve would just be a  guitar player for Bruce. This set had to be a major influence for the Underground Garage. A must-have collection!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000BTJDGC|2.0|The trailer of this flick is misleading.<br /><br />A somewhat decent courtroom drama, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is not a horror movie as the advertising would have you believe.  It's an okay put together study of was she/wasn't she possesed melodrama that doesn't fully answer that question, but that's about it.  The suspense in this film is stillborn and the chills are fleeting.  When first released the marketing campaign led the wary viewer to the conclusion that they would be subject to a new fangled 'EXORCISM' movie with a dark and dreary plot regarding a new, fresh take on demonic possesion.  Instead this motion picture is more of a character study for LAURA LINNEY's lawyer character, who strugles with the assumption that her  client (the exorcising priest, TOM WILKINSON) is or isn't witnessing the supernatual.  All of the supernatural events are witnessed in quick flashbacks which were all shown in the previews and aren't too unsettling at that.  I was waiting for some huge plot twist at the end which never came and made the proceedings even more laborious.  Given the subject matter this could've been creepier and better on a whole, instead the viewer is given the kind of movie typical of the SCI-FI channel sans any action or twisted humor.  A well made but run of the mill drama.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|If you missed this concert on PBS when it aired, this set is well worth the price.  Buble is in fine form and the audio and video on the disk do justice to the performance.  This DVD is especially good if you have a good 5.1 sound system and a wide screen TV.  The DVD is the compilation of two shows recorded at the Wilturn Theater in Los Angeles.  The main difference between this disk and the PBS special is the ending.  The Chris Botti guest appearance is the last song on the PBS special while on the DVD it is part of the bonus material.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|Although this version isn't as emotionally powerful as the Judy Garland-James Mason musical remake, this film does have some good moments, especially during the musical sequences.  <br /> <br />Of course, the one that is most powerful to me is Evergreen. I especailly love the way she sang it live for the film. She was exactly right when remarking in the AFI special \\"100 Greatest Songs\\" that if she had lip-synched, it would have destroyed the spontaneity of the moment. Once again, Barbra was right on target. <br /> <br />Like many of the reviewers here, I'm anxious myself for this to be released on DVD. But as the say \\"All good things to those who wait\\". Since this was really the first picture Babs had control over, she would want nothing less than the best product out there. The best picture transfer, soundtrack sound and supplements. It will definitely be worth the wait. Who knows, maybe they'll include the first time Barbra was interviewed by Barbara Walters?  <br /> <br />But I'm dying to see what the wardrobe tests will be like. Since her wardrobe was from \\"her closet\\", what will that extra be like? :-)   <br /> <br />

B000024D4R|5.0|As my title says, Animals is more agressive than other Floyd albums. It's also more acoustic driven than others. But as agressive as it is, it's still the Floyd, and the Floyd is amazing! This album has the spacy keyboard sound that Rick used on Wish You Were Here, which I have grown attached to. Dogs is a brilliant song, it really is. It's 17 minutes long but it seems to last but 2 or 3 minutes. Of course, Pigs On The Wing, Pigs(3 different ones), Sheep(Where Rick really gets to stand out), and Pigs On The Wing are also great. Sheep was also brilliant, it seems ot be a mixture of Dark Side with the edge that would be expored in The Wall. Yes, this album was dominated by Roger, but he's still a great songwriter. Animals was underappreciated by an accident. It would've been more successful but this was when punk rock was getting popular. All the punks were bashing Pink Floyd so Roger refers to Sheep as them and the angry dogs as the punk rockers(I got nothing against punk rock I'm just telling the truth).<br /><br /> But then, Pink Floyd won the throne back with The Wall, but I'm not here to talk about The Wall. Anyway, this is still required in all Floyd collections without a doubt, and Animals definately ranks among Pink Floyd's best.<br /><br /> Leave those sheep alone, you dogs!
1400031362|5.0|alexander mccall smith's series about the traditionally built mma ramotswe and the people in her life is truly a landmark: a quiet and humble landmark, but a landmark nonetheless. with great compassion and humor mccall smith describes the trials and errors of modern africa, seen through the eyes of a most formidable private detective. the series is written with a lot of humor, a great deal of humility, and a love for africa that is so strong that it seeps through the text and pours into the heart of the reader. it has been a long time since I last read something this enjoyable: mccall smith has truly captured the heart of africa in his series.
0307276902|1.0|All in all, this is the book to read if you have a heart condition and your doctor has warned you off any sort of stress. Or if you're insomniac. Or if you're a pacifist -- there won't be any of that bothersome action and intrigue in this book. Of course, a picture book would work just as well -- you know, one of those coffee table deals from Ansel Adams or something -- but if you feel you really should be looking at words, but don't want too much excitement, intrigue, or action to stress your system, well, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is the book for you.  <br />It's a book full of Lies!!!! UGHHHHHHHHHHHH! <br /> <br />I mean, provided you didn't pay list price for the book, in which case you'll be kicking over furniture as you stomp toward the bookstore to demand a refund. (Little danger of paying full price for this dud, though, as AMLP has deservedly become a fixture in the remainder bins of most bookstores.)  <br /> <br />What an awful piece of crap!! Some of the dialogue was just atrocious. I mean, really, have you ever heard anyone actually talk like the character's in this book?  <br /> <br />I'm so shocked at Oprah- for picking this book, It's pathetic, mindless, jingoistic, boring, offenisve RUBBISH!  <br /> <br />
140003180X|5.0|yet another wonderful addition to the series about the traditionally built mma ramotswe in botswana. a great deal of redbush tea is consumed, small and large problems are pondered, and hands are held underneath the table. mccall smith possesses a rare gift for making the small things in life stand out like shining jewels, and his characters are charming, vivid and loveable. a thorougly enjoyable reading experience!
0307276902|2.0|I read this before all the controversy started, and my opinion hasn't really changed. As I read it, I kind of had a suspicion that things would turn out as they have. Frey seemed like a spoiled rich kid, trying to show everyone that he was \\"badder\\" and \\"tougher\\" than he really was. When I saw that he had admitted just that, I was not surprised. <br /> <br />The book is written in an interesting way, and I guess it's interesting, but I couldn't enjoy it because I disliked the narrator/author. I was hoping that he would have changed in some way (other than not drinking) by the end of the book, but that didn't happen.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This CD is from the movie Brokeback Mountain, it is excellent and worth the price. As always it is a pleasure to deal with Amazon.com
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I never read the books of Sin City but I've heard of them. The movie looked good but I wasn't expecting much of it. But man I was wrong. This film was amazing. It was really dark, had alot of action and alot of blood. The movie is broken into three stories. My favorite is The hard goodbye. See theres this big guy named Marv. Not really a ladies man but he loved this hooker. She was murderd and Marv gets framed. But he won't go down easy and won't let the cops get him easy either. He beats people up or kills them or does both. The movie gets very graphic too. For example Marv tends to cut off a guys legs and arms. Or you'll see peoples heads get choped off. I'm gladd to own this 2 disc box set. You get the entire novel of The Hard Goodbye, trailers, behind the scenes including the cars of sin city, and of course the extended uncut version of the movie broken down into four stories. Very good piece of film and one of Frank Millers best work as a comic creator and hey as a director. Who knew he could direct.
B000023VR6|5.0|Like The Beatles, this is just a collection of really great songs. Ready to get the party started. Crack a bottle, spark a joint, or just cruise down the street in your six-four. Fresh off the success of Eminem's Slim Shady LP, Dre wanted to capitalize off the hype. He came strong with 18 great beats. Not a bad song. Some people complain that there are too many rappers featured, but it's just a great party album. A west-coast party before everyone started beefing. Everyone comes strong with their verses, including the not-so-well-known rappers. This kicked off the short-lived popularity of Xzibit, the rapper, before he pimped your rides. It also resurrected the career of Snoop Dogg, and proved that Eminem was more than a one-line joker. In 1999, Dr. Dre could do no wrong.    This goes well with the Up In Smoke DVD.
0802755240|5.0|I read Richard Matheson when I was a kid.<br />Now am rereading his works and appreciating them.<br />My favorite of all his works is I Am Legend, a tale of Robert Neville, who is the only non-vampire on earth. He spends his day trying to kill vampires and must endure their attempts to get him and taunt him by night.<br />It is in short brilliant.<br />But remember, it is part of an collection of other stories, but saying I Am Legend is just a short story in a book is like saying McGavin's Night Stalker was just another series.<br />I read this every few years since 1970, and regrettably lost track of it until now.<br />For fans of this genre it is a must. Who becomes a legend and the feared? The population or the last of his race?
B000BW7QWW|2.0|This is a continuation of one of the worst SciFi series ever to waste an airwave, Firefly. If that's the future, please, end it all now.  Bring on Armageddon because the human race is at an end.<br /><br />Collective I.Q.'s drop to the single digits. The gene pool is stagnant. Those are the only reasons I can think off why the politicos are so stupid, the military so inept, and the \\"heros\\" are idiots.  Please!<br /><br />And how about using a few brain cells. Let's see. It's the future. China and the USA have become \\"the\\" merged power. The resulting language is 1800's country bumpkin.  Mao says \\"hey\\"  No wait, that was Gomer.  No, the Captain of this lame starship.<br /><br />The chase scene between the zombies-to-dumb-to-talk-but-can-operate-a-spaceship and the pathetic crew really looked familliar.  I was watching Star Trek Nemesis - and it hit me.  Well, it was really, really obvious.  Serenity stole the ground chase from Nemesis almost shot by shot, up to and including the ship maneuvering in front of the racing ground vehicle so it can jump inside. But S.T. did it much better.<br /><br />The rabid fan base needs to get a life and discover real science fiction - not this trumped up hodge-podge of rehashed tired cliches and down right rip-offs of other movies.
B000BTC5LW|1.0|If a thousand fools rated a thousand movies that haven't yet been released on DVD, would a thousand silly consumers go in debt to buy the movies?  Good question. <br />This DVD, and so many others, especially in the concert video line, generate so many reviews.  I'm constantly amazed at how many people can recommend a movie and foam at the mouth over the extras, when the darned thing hasn't even been put on the market. <br />Yes, Pink Floyd is fantastic.  Yes, this was a killer concert.  Yes, I saw this and many other Pink Floyd tours since the mid 70s.  No, I won't give it 5 stars until I actually see the DVD.   <br />I'm sending in one star just to give some balance to the other reviews. <br />PS.  I got it from a reliable source, who got it from David Gilmour's sister's boyfriend's garbage man's auto mechanic that this will be released on the sixth sunday in June when there's a full lunar eclipse at noon. <br />Cheers, everybody!  Until then, let's watch the other great Pink Floyd stuff...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Holy Crap, why would FOX cancel such a great show. I'm a fan of all of the new Sci-Fi shoes (SG1, SG: Atlantas, Battlestar) and this is one of the best series ever.  Even my girlfriend likes it and wants to watch it over and over again. Part of what makes it so great is its ability to be believable. Very few parts of the show have grand futuristic scenes seen in shows like Star Trek. It is simply one of the best shows ever thought up and the writing is superb.
B00003CXXM|4.0|Director:  Doug Liman <br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Gabriel Mann, Walton Goggins, Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles. <br />Running Time:  119 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for violence and some language. <br /> <br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a cold blooded assassin, but he doesn't know it. He can kill anyone with just a glance, yet he doesn't even recognize his own name. Left for dead when a hit goes wrong, Jason is rescued from his watery grave in the sea and stitched up by Italian fishermen. Set loose in Europe, Jason tries to put the pieces of his life together (including his rapidly emerging ability to inflict violence when prompted) as it becomes clear that this dangerous and mysterious man is suffering from amnesia. Bourne is helped by Marie (Franka Potente from \\"The Princess and the Warrior\\" and \\"Run Lola Run\\"), a German woman desperate for cash, who takes Jason out of the dangerous hive of Paris to safety, but soon finds herself in deeper trouble than Bourne. On their tail are two dueling government agents (Brian Cox and Chris Cooper from \\"American Beauty\\") who would like nothing more than a dead Bourne, and a team of assassins who are sent out to finish the job.  <br /> <br />The poster for `The Bourne Identity' screams: `Matt Damon Is Jason Bourne.' Honestly, they couldn't be more right. In perhaps his biggest star performance to date, Damon conquers his new film with the authority of a Schwarzenegger, and the sleekness of a Brosnan. His performance is elaborate, moving back and forth from a man who doesn't understand what he's capable of, to a man who uses his capabilities to answer all of his questions. With his natural physicality, Damon can play the role easily. But with his ever-searching actor instincts, Damon finds shades within Jason Bourne to play with; just enough to help elevate the movie into territory Bond stopped trying to reach for three decades ago. Damon's chemistry with Potente is also a treat, as the film never veers too much into romantic territory, but leaves enough room for the heat between the two to seep through. They work very well together.  The real star of the picture is director Doug Liman, formerly of the anemic 1996 comedy \\"Swingers\\" and the appealing 1999 caper \\"Go\\". There is nothing in those two films that would suggest that Liman is capable of handling a spy thriller. And that's the beauty of `The Bourne Identity.' It's a story (here based on the best selling series by Robert Ludlum) that's been in play many times before, and Liman takes the challenge head on. Directing with a dazzling flair for tension and action set pieces, Liman conducts his \\"Bourne\\" very simply and efficiently. There are minimal explosions, no godforsaken quips from the lips of the characters, and the film is one of the fastest paced in recent memory.  <br /> <br />Liman is helped by fantastic European locations (shot crisply by Oliver Wood), an exhilarating score by John Powell (\\"Shrek\\"), and a swift script by Tony Gilroy and W. Blake Herron, but you can easily tell Liman's heart and dedication is really into the story and the characters. His heart is into the action as well, with the film containing many impressive hand-to-hand combat scenes that feel fresh and real, a mid-movie car chase that spells doom for any fingernails in the audience, and a climactic shootout that has Bourne literally riding another bad guy down the middle of a staircase. Wild, unpredictable moments like these are scattered throughout the film, and they make the ride that much more pleasurable. Liman has a clear vision for \\"The Bourne Identity\\", and his mission is accomplished.
B000063UR2|3.0|\\"Legend\\" has become one of those movies from the 80s that was originally a box office bomb but attained a huge cult following as a generation (myself included) grew up with it on cable (\\"Clash of the Titans,\\" \\"Dragonslayer,\\" and \\"Willow\\" were in the same boat). <br /> <br />This is Ridley Scott's great experiment with the Joseph Campbell-via-George Lucas world of Hollywood fantasy, and it's one of the richest, most beautiful visual experiences ever committed to film.  I'm not sure what awards the cinematography, special effects, and costume design won, but I hope they swept the Oscars in those categories.  There has NEVER, EVER been a more beautiful fantasy world created in all of film history.  It outdoes even the Lord of the Rings trilogy, despite being made a decade and a half earlier without the benefit of any CGI. <br /> <br />While it has the nostalgia and mindblowing visuals going for it, it's hard for me to watch this movie as an adult because of the weak characters and plot.  Nothing wrong with the simple story of the hero's quest to save the world from evil, but this one is so by-the-numbers that it put me to sleep when I tried to watch the DVD.  The only saving grace is watching Tim Curry chew scenery through all that makeup, reveling in the archetypical simplicity of pure, childish evil while the other actors (especially Tom Cruise) never shake themselves out of archetypical stiffness. <br /> <br />A word of warning about this DVD.  I saw an earlier reviewer mention that a disk was missing from the Ultimate Edition they bought at Circuit City.  The same thing happened to me with a copy from Best Buy, so I didn't get to see the Euro version that I bought the DVD for in the first place!   Beware!
0307276902|5.0|Art is from the artist's perspective. This book is not a self-help book, but the writer's thoughts about his experience.  Would we chastise a work of art because the artist's interpretation of a person or landscape or any object doesn't look exactly correct.  That's what art is about the way someone sees it.  I loved the poetry in how this guy tells his story! James Frey should not apologise for anything. To stir this emotion proves it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I will not say too much about this film; there are surprises beyond the \\"They're gay!\\"<br /><br />But Heath Ledger -- whom i've seen 2ce this weekend -- deserves the Oscar.  His near-inarticulate Ennis, a blue-collar guy w/a lavendar undershirt [talk about closeted; he's practically 'drawered'!] is a wonder, loving Jack Twist [Jake Gyllenhal, equally superb; but then, he's*always*  sensitive & underplays his roles well] despite his own heterosexual yearnings.  He's great whether riding a horse, kissing a girl, *or* kissing his one True Love.<br /><br />Here's hoping this film convinces people that being gay is not a sin [think otherwise?  & do *you* poop a mile outside the city limits?  It's commanded right there in The Bible, right next to the prohibition against gayness...] nor [as psychologists accepted a generation ago] a 'mental illness', but something inborn, like eye color or blood type.  All those in favor of stoning those w/brown eyes...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I really love this CD - the music is intoxicating and I can listen to it's rhythm over and over again - it's a nice CD to walk or excersise to because it has a wonderful beat! She has done it again - Bravo!
B00005R23S|4.0|I've never really been a Spingsteen fan but after watching this DVD I am converted. So is my Wife & Son. The sheer energy that is generated is enough to give the viewer a full 'workout', no need for a gym when you watch this DVD. In parts it is very serious, in others, a party atmosphere ensues, but whatever the mood, it is guaranteed of being top-notch entertainment from begining to end. The picture is in 16:9 format and is extremely sharp. The sound is in DD 5.1 and is also pretty good. If you love good music then there is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best music DVD's around.
B00004VY01|4.0|This is a well acted, quirky period piece with an unusual story line. Here, an English gentleman (Stephen Dillane) is looking for a weekend of fairly anonymous sex in hopes of fathering a child, as his invalid wife is not up to the task. An impoverished Swiss miss (Sophie Marceau) is desperate for money due to her family's circumstances. She passes muster during the initial interview with the English gentleman and is hired for the job of potential surrogate mother. Their nights of anonymous sex turn out to be a surprise for both of them, yet they part with the understanding that they will never again meet. Their union having proved fruitful, she ultimately gives birth to a child, their daughter, who is taken from her immediately after birth and given to the father, as contracted. For seven long years they are separated. They are then all brought together, causing upheaval and tumultuous changes in all their lives.<br /><br />This is a well acted drama with fine performances by the entire cast. The only wrong note is struck by the child who plays the seven year old daughter. She is simply odious and obnoxious, making the viewer itch to slap her. There is nothing that the child does that makes the viewer feel the child's desire for a mother. The other performers, however, more than make up for this one dimensional child actress. Moreover, the cinematography is quite beautiful, with stunning shots of a fairytale lake house. All in all, this is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Now I have to go out and get that 4-cd box set of Cream.    This DVD has some incredible playing on it.  That old guy on guitar can play, can't he?  I'm trying to figure out what he's playing through--is it a Fender Bassman amp?  Never would have been loud enough back in the day, but amazing tone when amplified through a PA.      Stormy Monday, wow, when he starts hitting the solo notes, sending them out into sustain and feedback, then listening to the crowd come unglued, THEN ripping into blistering riffs, WOW.  Just too many amazing musical moments like this, but that's the one I watched last night.      I've often wondered about Clapton's legacy, given his tame solo career output, I often asked \\"What gives?\\"  Pretty tame stuff.  Going back to Cream and the Bluesbreakers, and placing it in historical context...ahhh, the lightbulb comes on.      Great concert.  Get it.  I have both the DVD and CD set, its worth it.

I've seen all the chapters subtitle in spanish and It was a long time ago that I waited nervous to see the next one (I think it was \\"These wonderful years\\"...10 years ago...?).

0307276902|1.0|If it were true, it would be life-changing. <br /> <br />Since it is not true, yet referred to as a memoir, it is appalling. <br /> <br />I don't appreciate being lied to.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|First off, I am a big fan of Grimm's fairy tales in general.  I was curious as to how they would pull off a movie about it.  I was surprised in a good way the way the screenwriter went about blending so many stories together.  I also give extreme credit to director Terry Gilliam.  He is the reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place.  He has always had an incredible eye through the camera.  I highly recommend anything he has done in the past.<br /><br />  The photography of the movie is spectacular, the colors and the settings made the movie feel like a true fairy tale.  The music added to the setting, giving tension and comedy.  The costumes were spectacular as well.<br /><br />  The only bad thing about the movie would be the two main characters.  It took me a while to like them but I thought it was funny how they were truly not very brave, but they pulled through in the end somehow making them feel more realistic.
0307276902|2.0|I read this book...before it was even an Oprah pick. I thought it was pretty interesting, kind of drawn out, the writing style though original became extremely tedious and annoying.  <br />The one thing so upsetting about the contraversy surrounding his book, is that if you are the kind of person who is inspired by other people's true life journeys, which I am, it is extremely disappointing to find out that the journey was not really as it was portrayed. The trust is lost.  <br />I really hope James doesn't decide to write ANOTHER memoir about the experience he has had being caught as a liar. He has no ethical standards, duped us all, and does not deserve to be selling anymore of these books, especially in light of the fact that he is an admitted liar.
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful movie.  Followed the book quite closely.  I wondered for awhile whether I'd be getting as emotional while viewing the movie as I did while reading the book since I already knew the story and found that I had tears streaming down my face for the last half an hour or so and couldn't talk for about 15 minutes afterwards.  The DVD extras were also nice with a piece on the director, Nick Cassavetes (son of John C and Gena Rowlands), a piece on the book's author Nicholas Sparks, and a piece on the selection of locations for the movie. If you loved the book, this movie is an absolute MUST see. If you haven't read the book, the movie is worthwhile for the wonderful performances of all four lead characters.  I am a particular fan of James Garner and he certainly doesn't disappoint here. <br />
B000002ITM|1.0|There are a few albums that have historical significance as the \\"end of eras.\\"  This is one of those albums.  This CD somehow exceeded the disapointment of Judas Priest's infamous Turbo.  The Ritual is #1 on my list of most-disapointing albums of all time.  Testament at the time was my favorite band.  I remember buying this CD when it came out, and nearly slashing my wrists. I couldn't believe that such a great thrash band could go pussy-up so spectacularly.  The only reason to buy this CD is to appreciate the history of a great band turning into \\"just another washup.\\"  Except for one or two good songs on subsequent albums, they never recovered from this debacle.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My wife and I did not see this show when it was originally aired on Fox and cancelled so quickly.  We were not even aware of it.  But now, to find a show that is so cleverly written, so real, with so many wonderful characters that you really care for in such a short time, is a tremendous gift.  Why Fox cancelled this show is beyond me--it shows some limited imagination on their part.  This series is one of the most satisfying TV shows I have ever watched.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is back doing what she does best:  dance music.  'Confessions on a Dancefloor' is a non-stop, continuously mixed gem of pulse pounding,  foot stomping dance music which is probably the best thing she had done since 'Ray of Light'.  Madonna pays homage to so many great dance artists, dance songs and, in true Madonna form, herself that 'Confessions. . .'  is a dizzying array of some of the best moments in dance music history.    HUNG UP, as we all know, samples Abba but when Madge sings \\"Don't cry for me . . .\\"  it's a tongue in cheek reference to Evita.  It's a great track and a great opener but I have to admit, the video is a bit embarassing.  She really should have stuck with La Chapelle.    GET TOGETHER (my personal favorite) does have a familiar vibe to Stardust's 'Music's Much Better With You' and when Madonna sings:  \\"Baby we can do it.  We can do it all night,\\" she pays homage to her hit 'Holiday' and the SOS Band's 'Take Your Time(Do It Right)'. Then there's a breakbeat where her voice echoes back on itself coming from the past and shooting  forwards to the future.  Then, when Madonna croons \\"Do you believe in love at first sight?\\" it brings back feelings of Cher's 'Believe'.    SORRY has a great bassline that does sound similar to The Jackson Five's 'Can You Feel It'.    FUTURE LOVERS Madge pays homage to Giorgio Moroder by loosely covering 'I Feel Love', Donna Summer's classic electro disco track which is possibly one of the most purely perfect dance tracks ever made.    I LOVE NEW YORK (another personal favorite) may have some of the most inane and awful lyrics of Madonna's entire career  but it's catchy as hell with a beat that throbs to your very core.  Then it becomes a bit suggestive when only the first half of \\"Get off my street,\\" is echoed over and over again.  This is true hardcore dancefloor dance music.    With  LET IT WILL BE (not a favorite), 'Confessions. . .' begins to loose steam. LIWB  is another homage to herself and, like everyoneelse says, it has  strings sampled from 'Papa Don't Preach'.    FORBIDDEN LOVE  Am I blue? Blah dah dah dah.  Probably my absolute least favorite track on the entire CD.  Very cheesy Euro House.  It will probably be a hit on Ibiza.  The 'Popcorn-esque' rhythms are more pronounced throughout this track than with JUMP, which only uses them for the beginning of the track.    Besides the familiar 'Popcorn'-esque rhythm that starts off JUMP, there's a little bit of the melody from Pet Shop Boy's  'West End Girls'  thrown in for good measure.  Then  the Rolls Royce 'Car Wash' hand claps kick in and you have this liberating retro futuristic plustating dance track.  One can only hope this is the next single.    HOW HIGH is what I would say is Madonna's homage to Brittany Spears.  Incredible bass heavy   beats with bubble gum pop vocals.  Gurrrrrl . . .     The hummed chorus of ISAAC is identical to the hummed chorus of  'Secret'.  It's pretty much house Hassadic or something like that.   It's fine, but a bit cheesy . . .  okay, it's very cheesy.   It's the most contrived track on the disc.    PUSH is Madonna pushing into nu-school r 'n' b territory with Madonna singing \\"Keep on pushing  . . .\\", in the same vocal style of Tom Tom Club's 'Genius of Love' with a rhythmic, synthesized chorus that harkens back to 'Like A Prayer'.    LIKE IT OR NOT  has a few Soft Cell stylized synthesized hand claps but outside of that it's a mediocre track with Madonna threatening to never stop making music.  It may possibly tie for being the worst track and an anti-climatic closer.    Perhaps this is Madonna's swansong.  After all, she is a mother of two and her shenanigans of yesteryear are literally a lifetime ago not only for her but also for a lot of fans as well.  Or perhaps this is the new beginning of the next chapter in Madonna's musicial career.  Who knows, but 'Confessions On A Dancefloor' is an enjoyable gem for all of us to ponder.
0385507755|5.0|I bought this book, read it and fell in love with it before it became \\"the next big thing\\" because Oprah said so. I think as a society the only thing we relish more than making heroes is crucifying them. The story is a poignant one and the bottom line is that Frey had an addiction and he overcame that addiction. Does that mean it was okay for him to lie, to alter key scenes, characters and facts?  Absolutely not. But that doesn't mean he isn't a superb writer. Why can't riveting, gripping, thought-provoking lit be just that? Let's get real here. At the end of the day, it's a book. A book! Paper and ink - nothing more, nothing less.   Leave Frey to his imagination.  A much more productive use of the media's time (thesmokinggun.com and Lady O included) would be to concentrate their collective efforts on taking down real dangers to society, like, oh I don't know, child molesters, rapists and murderers.  I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed AMLP as well as My Name is Leonard and I am eagerly awaiting his next work, regardless of what shelf it sits on in Barnes & Nobles.
B000002C1W|5.0|When I first heard  One Slip from this album many years ago - I immediately thought - what is Tony Levin doing on a Pink Floyd record? What a welcome addition of real talent to David Gilmour and Nick Mason! These musicians all possess that unique style that makes them stand out and be easily recognizable. Combine one of the world's best ever bass players with one of the most talented guitarists and songwriters and you have an enduring classic. Floyd's music really pulls you in on this album - very melodic with the kind of thought provoking lyrics the band is known for. Out of all the Floyd discs, this is the one I have come back to most - a wonderful collection of songs with the added energy and unique talent of Tony Levin to make it the best Pink Floyd disc ever!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Very similar to Is This It (expected, since it is the same band and all), and so draws a lot of comparison between the two. Granted, the first album is a tad better (being the original sure helps, too), but this is by no means a bad album. A lot of the songs, namely Reptilia, The End Has No End and 12:51 (probably my favourite off the disc) are fantastic songs. Catchy guitar riffs, great singing by Julian, etc. If you're looking for a different Strokes (haha...not intended), pick up First Impressions of Earth--another fantastic album, that is ironically drawing much criticism for sounding different. It seems as if the boys of the Strokes can't win whether they imitate of stray from their original sound. Either way, it's evolution, and it sounds amazing (at least to me). <br /> <br />FINALLY: This is a great CD for any rock fan, even those who have yet not jumped on to the Strokes-mania. Listen to it all at least once, then criticize.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I love John Mayer's work.  His independant EP and both of his studio albums are excellent, exhibiting a maturity (both lyrically and muscially) that belies John's tender years.  But anyone who has seen him play live knows that his heart truly belongs to the blues, and not the radio-friendly pop sound (albeit the highest quality pop) of his studio albums.  Mayer has always cited Stevie Ray Vaughan as one of his influences, but unless you had heard or seen him live, you may have wondered how SRV had influenced him.  But his live shows invariably include blusier versions of his hits and extended blues solos on songs like \\"Covered In Rain,\\" a staple of Mayer's live performances.<br /><br />This CD is a live set of nothing but the blues.  You can tell that John has been wanting to do this for some time, and you can tell that this is where his heart is.  Every song is excellent, with Mayer's vocals and guitar work hitting the bullseye every time.  He is ably backed by Steve Jordan on drums and Pino Palladino on bass.  This young white kid from back east plays like an old black guy from down sounth!  His cover of Hendrix's \\"Think I Better Wait 'Til Tomorrow\\" almost outdoes the original, much like SRV's version of \\"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)\\" improves on Jimi's original.  I think John would like that.  I hope that this is the John Mayer we hear going forward.  The first two albums were excellent, but this one is sublime!
B000002MFE|5.0|If you're looking for live Clapton, you have quite a few options. From the '60's, we have Live Cream, vols. 1 & 2 or Derek and the Dominoes Live, but those releases are pretty indulgent. Or you can pick up any one of his various \\"autopilot\\" live releases from the '70's and '80's. Or if you wanted, you could go with Unplugged, which is my pick.<br /><br />Though E.C. will forever be remembered as a pioneer with the electric axe, he could play some good folk guitar too, although that is a side of him rarely seen. For instance, listen to his heartbreaking rendition of (At the time) recent hit Tears in Heaven. Can you picture this as a rocker? Or how about another centerpiece of the album, the long jam Old Love? Just listen to his almost-Eastern guitar solo and tell me it would've worked electric. The stripped-down arrangement also aides the obligatory blues covers (Before You Accuse Me, Hey Hey, Nobody Knows You, Walkin' Blues), all fine except Rollin' and Tumblin', which simply doesn't work without electric guitar and mouth organ. And if that weren't good enough, he cuts loose and has a good time on San Fransisco Bay Blues, reinvents classic Layla, and puts some serious soul into Runnin' on Faith. A Clapton essential, surprising considering that it's from MTV!
B000002UBB|5.0|FLY LIKE AN EAGLE, along with GREATEST HITS 1974-1978 and BOOK OF DREAMS, is one of Steve Miller's three best albums ever. The songs are great, the playing is skilled without sounding slick, and the production is quite polished. This is the album that reestablished him with critics after he fell from grace with ROCK LOVE. The fact that Miller, like most other 70s rockers, believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted, as well as his advocacy of increased funding for community policing, makes this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B00000293E|5.0|You don't have to look very far to have proof this is a good album. In fact, just look at the tracklist of just about any rock album from the '60's and '70's. Chances are, you'll see a Willie Dixon song off this album. Out of the nine tracks, a good seven have been covered by famous rock bands, be they Jeff Beck (You Shook Me, I Ain't Superstitious), Led Zeppelin (You Shook Me, I Can't Quit You Baby), Cream (Spoonfull), the Doors (Backdoor Man), the Allmans (Hoochie Coochie Man) or the Stones (Little Red Rooster).<br /><br />Okay, so a lot of people played his music. But is it any good? A stupid question, of course. The answer is a loud, resounding, \\"Yes\\". Nine cuts of pure blues, with Willie providing the bass, the vocals, and innuendo-laced lyrics. But hey, it's the blues. As for the best songs, I'd say the top three are Spoonful, Back Door Man and Little Red Rooster, though I love every song here (You Shook Me and I Ain't Superstitious, by the way, get honorable mention). Although it's a blues album and recommended to any blues fan, it'll do well in a rock fan's collection as well.
B000BP86OG|5.0|still the greatest band ever. the darkness never seizes to amaze me. aven after justins throat surgery. hes still the greatest singer ever. how can you not like such a wonderful album?id rate it a 88/10 if i could.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Sorry Zep, but my vote for Best Blues-Hard Rock Debut of 1968 goes to Jeff Beck's Truth. It helps that Rod Stewart (A surperior frontman to Robert Plant, as everyone knows but is too scared to admit) takes the vocals and just shreds his vocal chords on the first cut, the Yardbird's Shapes of Things. Love him or hate him, you have to admit he's got PRESENCE. And Beck's guitar just wails away, equalling Stewart's trademark intensity. Then Rod takes the standard Ol' Man River and puts so much emotion into his vocal, it blows your mind, ladies & gents! And let's not forget the two Willie Dixon covers, You Shook Me & I Ain't Superstitious, which get the Beck reading and turn out just as good as the originals. Also worth it is the \\"every-rock-star-in-the-world-worked-on-it\\" instrumental Beck's Borelo, featuring Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, Keith Moon and Nicky Hopkins. Talk about a star-studded lineup! They should've looked into putting an album together, with Rod singing of course. Finally we get the aptly-titled Blues Deluxe, recorded live...what a song!<br /><br />Led Zeppelin never put out an album that came anywhere near this. Sorry, Zepeteers, but it's true!
B00005I44H|5.0|I have written reviews as far ago as ten years about this cycle and my opinion has not wavered. This is one of Gramophone Magazine's 100 greatest recordings of all time and deservedly so. The concertos are my favorite mozart works and I have literally heard all major recordings of these works. Nothing compares. I wanted to let everyone know that this cycle will be re-issued in 2006 for the Mozart 250th birthday celebration with additional material included. This particular issue contains no booklet and the new release will be far more comprehensive. These works have been in my cd player regularly since they were first released and even before that on LP. The concertos were intended to be conducted by the pianist with a chamber orchestra as here. The English Chamber Orchestra is well up to the task and in my opinion one of the premiere Mozart bands in the world along with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy. This is an issue to be treasured. Enjoy!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great movie!  Anyone wanting to watch it, however, really should rent/buy the entire \\"Firefly\\" television series to truly appreciate the movie.  If I hadn't been a fan of the show, I don't think I would have appreciated the movie nearly as much.  It's too bad they won't be doing anymore movies, I would have enjoyed following this franchise further.  All hail Joss Whedon!
B000002U82|5.0|Over 40,000,000 units sold and reviews still being written 33 years after, enough said. This album spent more time on the charts than some of you guys have been alive. If you don't own it you are cheating yourself.
0307276902|1.0|For anyone who has actually been to a treatment center, and has been in recovery for any length of time, this book immediately sends up numerous red flags.  Any time an addict claims to be more of an addict than other addicts, my radar goes crazy.  James Frey tries to portay himself as such a bad ass, when in fact he's no better or worse than other addicted individuals.  The real crime here is that there are people with addictions who may read this book and feel that Mr. Frey's ridiculous mantra of \\"just hold on\\" is really the way to stay sober.  It's a good thing that James didn't get in to AA, because the members would have recognized him as a fraud from day one. One of the hallmarks of the 12 step progam is brutal honesty.  I guess that's one of things Mr. Frey didn't like about the 12 steps.  It would have been a great story if it had been identified as \\"based on actual events\\" instead of touting itself as a \\"true\\" story. Once I found out that Mr. Frey made up significant portions of the book, which I wondered about from page one, it lost all credibility for me.  Unfortunately he will still have his millions of dollars to comfort him in his moment of scandal.  I only wish I could get my money back. This was my first and last experience with Oprah's book club.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|With the hype machine in full swing, its probably going to be somewhat difficult to find an objective review, but to be fair, this album is the business! So what of the comparissons that you've probably come across - The Kinks, The Specials, The Stone Roses or The Libertines? All could apply, but only really in terms of the Arctic Monkeys being a great British band. Most comparissons are simply cases of lazy referencing because besides the obvious, the album has a depth of style and sounds which takes in influences such as Nirvana and the Pixies, so don't worry about an American audience having to 'get' another quirky Limey band - this record is musically accessable to anyone whether they be in LA, New York or Kuala Lumpur. While its not the most original thing you've ever heard, somehow it comes across that way, and that's what makes the band so special. <br /> <br />What also makes the band so distinct is that the massive things they've achieved in a few short months has been done on thier own terms, no huge record company marketing strategy, just pure word of mouth, which in this day and age seems almost impossible. No way are you going to see this band on Saturday Night Live or Leno - they are just interested in letting the music do the talking. Everything you've read about this record is true and then some! Instead of waiting for massive MTV rotation, just go out and buy the album and make you're own mind up - you will not be disappointed.
0446677450|5.0|A dynamite book. This book should be read by everyone. It can change your financial life for the better. In my opinion, all kids 10 and up should read this book to gain financial intelligence and start their lives on a path to financial success. It will also stimulate adults of all ages to increase their financial intelligence and change their lives for financial security. <br /> <br />This is really a phenomenal book! I'm giving copies to 15 family members and friends, especially the older grandchildren. I'm 75 years old and I know what I'm talking about! I'd like to see this book used as a textbook to teach children about money. <br /> <br />H.E.Huston.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I saw this movie when it first game out on VHS as a kid and thought it was great. I always enjoyed vampire movies and tv shows, but this movie gave me a different perspective and I found it very interesting. As I got older, I appreciated the acting of Cruise in the movie. Maybe I'm not insightful to what Anne Rice wanted, but Cruise apparently saw Lestat as an emotional and dramatic soul who enjoyed being what he was, maybe even proud, and didn't appear to feel remorse for the hand nature dealt him. He always kept his sense of humor and energy throughout the movie. If that was his goal, then he accomplished it. I don't understand why some people didn't like it. I'm going to read the entire series soon, and maybe I'll have a different perspective, but as of right now, this is a very enjoyable movie, and Cruise did a great job in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Still, I can understand why people felt the actors should have switched roles. I could see Pitt as the aggressive, seducing Lestat and Cruise as the \\"tortured soul\\". It really could have worked either way.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|takemehome from indiana is a stupid redneck. panic at the disco makes me horny and i have a hard on right now thinking about it. they r amazin an who eva doesnt like them is a ginger and poo face. and im guna take a poop on there head a warm greasy, wet, slipperly, hot, crusty, juicy, bloodly, green and corny poo. yumm u can taste it right now. panic at the disco rocks!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|I am so glad I found this CD.  The music is very emotional, very powerful!  There are some harder music too, but I enjoy the more ballad type of songs: \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is the top song, right up there with the best Rock band ballads.  Then the songs \\"Broken Wings\\", \\"Down To My Last,\\" \\"Shed My Skin,\\" and \\"In Loving Memory\\" just make me feel good everytime I listen to them.  One of my favorite more heavier rock songs is \\"Burn It Down.\\"  However, \\"Mentalingus\\" is everything a rock song should be, and I think it should of had grammy consideration!!  Also, I am sure the people that prefer the more heavy rock will call out of few of the other songs!     Just a great all around album, I can't wait for their next album!!  I may even prefer this album more than the Creed albums...and that is saying something because Creed was great!!  Scott has a fantastic voice, but Myles is right up there with him and beyond.  I think if you like Creed, you more than likely will like Alter Bridge too!!!

B000001DTM|5.0|U2 best stuff by far, totally expieremantal and tricked out, just listen to the fly, its guitar solo kicks, zoo station is a led zeppelin song in the begining, ultraviolet is the most beautiful and soothing song ever, and one is the greatest song ever recorded, the middle is sort of jazz like, and the end sounds so good when the edges giutar kicks in.

B00003CWPL|5.0|This is a powerful example of what it's like to be insane.  Reality is truly distorted, and you see it through Henry's eyes and hear it through his ears.  That some classify this film as horror is no surprise.  Any mentally ill person who's had visual/auditory hallucinations will tell you his/her entire life is a horror movie.  I often recommend this film to my psychology students. <br /> <br />PS--Anyone notice Peter Gabriel's tribute to this film in \\"Sledgehammer\\"?
0316776963|4.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is a really funny book, written by a really funny guy, who makes a lot of really funny observations. Really. Funny. Ok, I'm not getting far with this. Sometimes I find it hard to review funny books that are successful in, well, being funny. If someone sets out to write a funny book, and succeeds, then the result is, well, funny. David Sedaris is that. He's funny. Ok, I won't use that word anymore. <br /> <br />As a person who reads about a book a week, I find it more and more rare the instance when I actually laugh out loud, or LOL as the people who like to use consecutive uppercase letters refer to it these days. This book made such an occurrence commonplace in the mere 270 pages of text offered here. Every page seemed to contain an L, many of them of the OL variety. Those fortunate enough to sit next to me on the train likely thought I was crazy. Serves them right. <br /> <br />This is not a cover-to-cover book, but a collection of essays presumably written by Sedaris over some set of years. While I generally tend to avoid essay collaborations due to their non-linear nature and the about face you need to perform in ending one and picking up the next, Sedaris pulls it off by being so entertaining. Each story occupies 5-15 pages of text, often times packed with pearls and/or nuggets of entertaining wordplay. The only downside is that, again, there is no groove. If you know, going into it, this is the way the book is going to read, you can better approach it by reading it in 5-15 minute intervals. <br /> <br />Overall, that's about it. Sedaris is a gay man with a low IQ (his words) who writes hilarious stories about living in New York or living in France or trying to learn French. These sardonic slices of life, rife with peculiar observations Sedaris crafts with interesting word choices, keep you interested page after page. While probably a little bit over the top at times - possibly intentional, you can get away with it when you're this ffffff...no, I promised not to say it anymore. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a book many people (who aren't homophobic) should enjoy. Some of the stories will be more pertinent to those familiar with New York, but it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. I highly recommend the read.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This has commentary from Michael Beck about many parts of the movie and what they went through during filming. Extra scenes, includes the original theatrical trailer. Love this cult classic.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|My husband and I have watched this movie numerous times and just loved it. I bought it for his birthday, so anytime we feel like watching it we have it. Great movie.....
B000002KE2|5.0|Yes, I really do think that change was necessary for the band at this time. They would have painted themselves into a corner if they had continued to play regular heavy metal. Here, the band cuts down on the heaviness and adds more melodic and atmospheric sounds. <br /> <br />Some examples of this new sound are heard on songs such as Tomorrow's Dream and Cornucopia, two melodic rockers. Supernaut is HEAVY, this song could have easily fit onto an earlier album. Snowblind is a catchy tune, with some of Tony's best riffs. This was supposed to be the name of the album, but the record company wouldn't have it since the word \\"snowblind\\" is drug-related. (useless trivia). Nice keyboards at the end.  <br /> <br />Changes is a piano/keyboard based ballad. Lots of fans slam on it, but I like it so sue me. Ozzy conveys pretty good emotion (tough to believe). FX is an eerie instrumental made by odd guitar sounds and Laguna Sunrise is another instrumental. It is very relaxing and you can kick back to it easily (more nice keyboards as well). St. Vitus' Dance is an upbeat song that is VERY different from anything else the band had done at that point.  <br /> <br />Two songs i REALLY like are the first and last ones. The first song is the killer eight minute opener Wheels of Confusion. It is very progressive rock sounding and it has a nice closing piece called The Straightener. It has an AWESOME melody and really makes you wonder how Tony can even comprehend riffs like that. And the closer Under the Sun is amazing. Those riffs at the end will make your jaw drop. And in the middle, there is a piece called Every Day Comes and Goes, which is FAST. Definitely a headbanger, and keep in mind, this was 1972! <br /> <br />So this album really pushed the band forward into new directions, which are evidenced on their next couple of albums. This is just the beginning of the upcoming changes that we would hear from these guys later on....
B000002LQR|5.0|Every song on here rocks! Slow, fast, doesnt matter they all rock.
B000002KFJ|4.0|With the release of Sabotage, Black Sabbath goes back to a heavier sound, while keeping the experimentation going at the same time. Most of this album is HEAVY, but yet still melodic.     The album kicks off with Hole in the Sky, a brutal headbanger. After the count-in, the song bursts in with a riff that just kicks your ass across the room. Ozzy sings at the top of his lungs on this one. Don't Start (Too Late) is a relaxing 50 second instrumental that displays Tony's amazing guitar abilites. Then comes Symptom of the Universe, which is said to be the first thrash metal song. And keep in mind, this was 1975! The opening riff is just MEAN, and then the song simply destroys you. Ozzy sounds like he is about ready to kill someone. And then there is Megalomania, a sprawling ten-minute powerhouse. The first half is slow and disturbing, but the killer part is the second half, whwere the song picks up and Ozzy sings at the top of his freakin lungs and truly sounds like he is going psycho. Pretty impressive.    The Thrill of it All is another awesome heavy number, which has great synthesiser playing at the end. Am I Going Insane is a synth-driven pop song quite unlike the rest of the album. Most people hate it, but I find it quite enjoyable. Supertzar is a strange song with a choir. I don't find it to be a favorite, but does Tony does lay down some killer riffs. The album concludes with The Writ, a HEAVY eight minute song, where Ozzy f*cking SCREAMS (how does a MAN do this?).    Ozzy claims that this album was the beginning of the end for the band, but I think it is an excellent album. Metalheads are required to check this one out!
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Got this album when it was first released.  A mixture of pop/hard rock.  Great album every song rocks, a must have.
034537410X|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my psychology professor, and this is a great compilation of the best new research in lucid dreaming techniques.  Though I've tried to research this topic online, good advice is sparse and hard to find.  This book brings it all together.  It contains a variety of methods and advice to fit the sleeping and dreaming habits of every individual, and sorting through them can be tedious, but i strongly suggest that you spend the time and through trial-and-error, this book will guide you through the process to having more and better lucid dreams.  Good luck and enjoy!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album is not my favorite of the foo fighters, only because i dont ever listen to the second cd, which is the acoustic.  Id rather listen to jack johnson if I want to listen to acoustic. <br />but the first cd ROCKS! The foo got back to there roots the songs are a mix of all there albums to the grunge first self titled album to the slower pop from one on one. <br />whoever doesnt rate this album atleast at 4 stars, does not understand music.
B000002I53|5.0|There has to ba first Coltrane CD for everyone and this was mine. The whole cd is wonderful especially the title track, which may be one of the greatest accomplishments in jazz. Mc Coy Tyner is especially prominent and plays very well here. With Kind of Blue and a Love Supreme, this stands as one of the all time best jazz cds.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)~ F. Murray Abraham is a supperior cut since it allows the viewer to better understand the relationship between Mozart and Sallieri. It also adds valuable scenes for instance when Constanza Mozart is turned down by Salieri. For my part they could have added even more since I absloutely love this movie and I think they could have fleshed out some scenes even more (like another 30 minutes or so). F. Murray Abraham is stupendous in his role as Salieri and Tom Hulce is also great in his interpretation of Mozart. I love the music, the costumes and the scenery of this amazing movie and I think it is a movie not to be missed. Most definitely reccommended.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|The Cream you hear on these 2 cd's will sound a little different than the Cream of the 1960's. They're all 38 years older and you will hear it in their voices at times. Not their playing though which is just fine. The main difference in the Cream of today and the Cream of the 60's is that Eric Clapton sings a lot more today than before and Jack Bruce sings less.  <br />They do a great deal of their earlier catalog witha few nice surprises like Stormy Monday. If you are a Cream fan, you will want to own this.
B0007OASII|5.0|For the longest time, I regarded these guys as just another run-of-the-mill power metal band, with nothing to stand out from the pack in an exceedingly crowded & competitive genre.<br /><br />This album changes everything - it's a masterpiece that any of their competition would kill to have written.  The production and playing are flawless, but it's the writing that slays.  Songs are loosely organized into an ongoing story of some rather romantic nature, but each song has its own identity, with a few little interludes that help group parts of the album together and make the whole album stronger.  The melodies are instantly memorable, and there's a considerable amount of vocal talent on display - both Kamelot's own Roy Khan and the various guests, who add a lot of color.  I don't want to degenerate into a list of highlights, but I must mention \\"The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)\\", which is not just an album highlight, but a highlight for metal in the last decade - I've been listening metal for a long time now, and few songs have ever sent chills down my spine like that one does.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is one of the BEST Original Broadway Cast Recordings EVER!! Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth are absolutely brilliant on this! If you are a fan of Idina, Kristen, RENT, or the Wizard of Oz in general, you will love this play! it really does tell you \\"What happened before Dorothy dropped in!\\"
0143036556|5.0|I always love reading Jared Diamond (no relation to Neil) he just has smart things to say. This book is no different in my judgment from his other works, its subject is different but there are some similarities as well. I read the book and it takes me back, back to what some call simpler times, but I don't know~`All life is fraught with immanent peril and if I digress forgive me, I have a point. <br />     You see it was around  thirty odd  years ago that I became a partner with my buddy Joe. Good ole Joe had experience in 4H and had great success raising and showing, rabbits at the fair. He had a few ribbons under his belt and a couple of empty cages up in the barn and we began to chat. Joe explained to me the ease in raising rabbits and if we had good stock (Ribbons from the fair)  we could breed the champions and sell the baby rabbits for  a respectable profit. Me not one to shy away from a sure deal signed on with an investment of somewhere around $60.00 to buy a couple of show rabbits, I forget what kind, they had a reddish coat and big ears.  <br />    Yep that's how Joe and I became partners, we went to a respected bunny man and bought some prime bunnies, then we put them in the cage's separate and fed them water and bunny food. Easy enough, I remember the pile of rabbit dung piled up a couple of feet and it sure did not smell pretty, but neither does a lot of business deals. It came time to put the male with the female (Joe knew when I just watched, once voyeur...) anyway the two went at it like a frigging whirling dervish in a blender. Joe separated them and then we waited, not one bunny, not one. So we coupled them again, again the freak show, the long wait and nothing , no bunnies. Joe being 51% owner of our enterprise asked around and soon discovered we had bought some bum rabbits, they were not to old to copulate but to old pro-create, the baby bunny was doomed. We were pretty bummed. I was until I decided after reading many a fishing magazine how much money you could make farming worms! I told Joe about my idea and he was not cheered in the least, in fact the little pessimist scoffed if memory serve's . So I sent away and got some information on worm farming and realized that rabbit poop would be my secret earthen ingredient to raise super worms that fishermen would drive miles to buy from me and eventually my employee's. Joe gave me permission to dig some of the poop from under the cages for my new independent business venture. I dug up a bunch of dirt and found worms in my yard and then hunted some at night with a flashlight. I had a box I had made that my mom was not to pleased with sitting behind the house outside the kitchen window. My father tried to persuade me that pure rabbit poop sprinkled with urine was maybe not the best way to raise a super breed of fishing worms, I judged them fools and moved on...Well the rabbit earth became real hard and all the worms died. I was the only one surprised. I tell you I sometimes think people are happier if you fail. Why this book reminded me of this I do not know, but read the book!Its pretty dang good!
