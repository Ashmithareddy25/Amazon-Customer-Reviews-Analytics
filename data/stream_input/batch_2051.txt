B007BFSYMS|3.0|First, I do like the app.<br /><br />A couple issues: there's no option to have app close when sleep timer runs out (it stays open), &amp; I there's no simple/special access to sounds marked as favorites.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews the pleas to rate are pushy (bye-bye 5th star), and Brown Noise is my favorite. I'm glad it's early in the alphabet, since favoriting doesn't do anything but put a star next to it in the list of ALL the sounds. I tried to email tmsoft using the feedback feature from inside the app, but got a permanent delivery failure:<br /><br />&quot;Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently:<br /><br />feedback@tmsoft.com<br /><br />Technical details of permanent failure: Google tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain tmsoft.com by smtp.secureserver.net....<br /><br />The error that the other server returned was: 550 #5.1.0 Address rejected.&quot;<br /><br />The rejected address is my official store address. (Bye-bye 4th star for no way to contact tmsoft &amp; for the rude rejection).<br /><br />Good app in general, still, I'm suddenly glad I didn't give these folks money--as I'd been considering prior to Amazon making this the FAOTD.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon (seriously)!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Love it
B0075XRUBM|5.0|The phenomenon is well found and simply explained. The examples are outspoken and underline the proof. The second half of the book becomes a little bit bad, because the writer tries to explain the proof again and again.<br /><br />I do recommend the book because it gives you a new perspective on selling. In the global internet age, there is a market and a demand for everything. The only thing you need is to get this together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|such a great game my only problem is that u don't chose ur first horse but over all a good game
0670033375|5.0|This book is mainly about the economy of ecological systems and the disruptive influence people have on this well balanced ecosystem called earth. The book starts with an explanation on collapsed societies, where this was done by man through handcraft.<br /><br />The end of the book describes the modern and sometimes hidden damage that we create today. If you would extrapolate the behaviour of the current global society, then a collapse is coming. The question is when.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave this a high rating because it was well written and very clever - I never guessed where it was going.  I was gripped by the clever twists and turns.  I think most married partners may see a glimpse of themselves  in the psychological personality traits presented.  Great character development - riviting plot.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|As long as you know the previous stories you will like this.  Like the prospects<br />of the continuing saga.  Great acting by Bale.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice game and set up it also help me clear my mind free purchase can't complain amazon have great apps thanks
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a really addictive game. My daugher showed me how to play. Its cute and engaging. The plus was that it was free.

0811879542|5.0|I love this book, I love that it is interactive and allows the child to learn and have fun with the reader. Simple yet effective.
B005QJZ5FA|2.0|It was recommended from a friend who thought that since I liked 'Garbage' I might enjoy Lana Del Rey. Well the vocal is good but the lyrics are nothing to write about
B003P9VZ0W|3.0|Great Price. Cheapest I found from all over the internet. Only down side is they are smaller than i thought. They do not come with enough stickers to make a room really pop. They kind of look like scattered stickers all over my daughters wall. no matter what you do, they are just not big enough for a bedroom. But the quality of the product is great
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was well- written and engaging. The characters are a bit twisted, and the reader definitely wants to get to the bottom of the mystery at hand.  I don't want to reveal too much as that is the fun of this narrative.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was very interesting I could not stop reading it! I really liked the describing words Rick uses in his book I will definitely recommend this book to my friends to read
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I have an MSI GT70, and it just barely fits in the padded laptop compartment; the zipper is a little tight, but it's good enough.  lots of space and plenty of pocket.  well constructed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|All three episodes totally blew my mind and exceeded what I had expected. The script, the actors, actresses, music, cinematography, costumes were extraordinary. The twist and turn were more than great! The people who created this show started with the passion, still keep this passion heated, and will spread this passion to many others. It definitely worth the time to watch this show, even re-watch it several times. I introduced this show to many of my friends and relatives and we all LOVE it!!!

B007R108WA|4.0|Very well done, true the book, not for the faint hearted viewer as it has a very violent and disturbing theme.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|FUN! I enjoy playing this on my kindle, it keeps my mind busy, but yet can relax. I know weird.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|The only thing better than the third season of the vampire diaries is the fourth that we are in now.  Don't be put off because you think it is a teeny-bopper thing--just watch and enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|entertaining and fun while still being a free game. wish you could adjust the sensitivity though. worth a shot, its free!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|After all the news came out about Manti Teo and with the new Catfish TV show, I wanted to see what started it all.  I was not disappointed.  This is a very enjoyable documentary about a real love for a fake person.  How they pieced it all together and then went and tracked the real person behind the fake persona down is fascinating and deserving of a TV show.  After you watch it, be sure to go to the Catfish website and watch him meet the person that was the image of the woman he was falling in love with.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Bought this movie for my son, but apparently he's not really a cat person. It is still a great movie though.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very entertaining read. Totally fiction but very believable. I also loved the movie which was a little different but also very entertaining and visually dramatic.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I bought this for my husband's birthday. It is a must for any sci-fi fanatic. The packaging is pretty need too.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I am uninstalling this app, since every time I try to play it forces itself to close at the second screen.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Okay so Diablo 3 ended up being kind of a crappy game, it doesn't mean this mouse is too bad though. For the $45 that I paid for this thing, it has been a pretty awesome little mouse. I'll keep this review short and sweet because there are others that go into more details. Bottom line this is a really great mouse for the price. I can't think of a better one at the $50 price range but there are way better ones if you can spend around $70-$80.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cost<br />Tracking<br />Works on all surfaces<br />Comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not enough buttons to program<br />Can't customize too much<br />Can't turn glowing light off<br />Wheel isn't great<br />Mouse is large so won't fit small hands<br /><br />So if this is on sale for $45 or less I would say its a must buy for a gamer with medium to large size hands. If you have a little bit more to spend though I would say upgrade to something a little nicer if you can.
0425263916|5.0|I just can't get enough of Eva and Gideon. They are perfect to the eyes of people, but only they would know their own damages and weakness, How they needed each other to survive.
0345529057|4.0|I highly recommend this deal, its a great way to get into the series for a great price. The first 3 books are very engaging, thoughtful and fun. It is a great page turner set. And then there is the 4th book. 5/5 stars for book 1-3 and 1.5/5 stars for book 4. It feels completely disjointed and focuses on minor characters that I really didn't care about. Whereas book 1-3 I couldn't wait for the next chapter and who it would focus on, book 4 I would cringe when I saw the chapter titled \\"Brienne\\" once again. Again, I totally recommend this series, just be prepared to be disappointed with book 4. I think this set would make a great gift as well.
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen makes a great chronicle of life. The way country people behaved and their thoughts. Just a wonderful and timeless book.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Although I regret not seeing this on the big screen, it was a well told story from a clever point of view and turned out to be very entertaining. Great way to spend a couple of hours on the weekend.
0425263908|5.0|One in a million. How can one simple meeting change two lifes for good? How can they life one without the other? This is a addicting history.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|I enjoyed this book in many ways, although it tended to be a bit wordy.  But, with a bit of fastforwarding it was exciting and had more than a few twists and turns.  Mr. Follett manages to bring the complexity of the Middle East, and the dangers of trying to maneuver through its political and theological landscape, to the written pages of this novel.  Interestingly he is able to make a ruthless assassin somewhat likable, and illuminates a world where people matter far less than politics, revenge and hate.<br /><br />The main focus of the book is a race to nuclear weapons between Israel and islamists in Egypt.  With a creative Mossad agent, some luck, assistance from friends, and old debts called in, the Israeli's are well on their way to hijacking a shipment of nuclear fuel.  A chance encounter blows the cover of the Mossad agent, and the story becomes a race of time and trial of wits. A twist is thrown in here which I won't disclose, but it adds intrigue and intensity to the story. It also explains the title, which puzzled me until that point.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of the Israelis, but it is not without balance, and it clearly shows the politics and background of many of the issues we faced then, and now, in that volatile part of the world.  The only real weakness of the book was the final showdown which was somewhat improbable, but the rest of the book was full of intrigue, suspense, cleverness and plain good storytelling and it easily overcame the one small weakness of the end.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is a cool book and funny book too.I live this book because of the picture of Greg and his friend too.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is a great film by an independent production company associated with actress/producer Elizabeth Banks.  I saw the film the day it opened months ago, was wowed by the story and the soundtrack, saw it again-still was wowed, and then went back and saw it again a few more times at the local dollar theaters.  This film just gets to you and you walk out smiling every time.  If you don't then you need to go your attitude checked with a pitch pipe.  The film should have been up for a Golden Globe in the Musical/comedy categories.  The movie and script are great although not Academy Award nomination worthy.  The way the soundtrack is put together is worthy of an Oscar nomination for musical direction.  The entire cast does a really good job particularly all of the ladies who make up the Barden Bellas.  Some of the comments by the characters portrayed by Elizabeth Banks & John Michael Higgins are priceless. It's a film worth seeing many times and is destined to a cult classic.  Also any film that pays some homage to 1985's \\"The Breakfast Club\\" & its wonderful song \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" deserves many kudos.  \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is one of the best films of the 1980's and one of the best works by the late director John Hughes.  This film \\"Pitch Perfect\\" is one of the great delightful surprises of 2012 and will be bringing smiles to many faces for a long, long time.  I'll be very surprised if someone doesn't figure out a way to adapt this film into a Broadway musical comedy play.  If you just like good comedy and music this film is for you!!
0684857219|5.0|By far the best book I have purchased about working out. It provides great motivation and advice. The intensity of my workouts improved significantly after reading this book. I have a much greater appreciation for muscular definition and separation than I did before.
B000OVLINI|4.0|Ruiz's multi-layered plot made me want to read to uncover the ultimate truth of Daniel's quest. Ruiz's villains can rank with other prototypes who frustrate and thwart their protagonists.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I originally downloaded this game/app for my daughter. She asked me for help one time and I was hooked..lol. Now I find myself playing this game whenever I have to wait someplace or if I'm a passenger in a car. It's a good &quot;time killer&quot;.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This  Game  is highly  addicting ,  and  a  lot if fun.  The  only thin that I didn't like  so far is the annoying  screen that  asks the user to pay  for the game  while  you are playing. Right in the  middle of the game play, it just abruptly stops  during the  action and the screen appears  asking for  to pay  for using the free version or  continue  on.  The  whole game is about getting the right  angles  and trajectories  to  do as  much damage as possible, to get to the next level.
044654759X|5.0|This was a really neat book to read. I love the author's way of writing and have read several of his books.
0385738765|2.0|I did like the Maze Runner - until the end when the entire construct of a 2 year experiment in a massive artificial environment that involved many deaths of youths seemed largely unjustified and, regardless of money and technology available, totally unrealistic in a post apocalyptic world.  To me, after reading the Scorch Trials, it really seemed like Dashner's whole talent is directed at depicting curiosity and suffering simply for the sake of doing so.  The story arc is ridiculous - just putting mystery after mystery on top of suffering and pain and then, at the end, trying to patch the story together with a weak explanation of WICKED and its goals.  I suppose an angst ridden teen might like this just for the emotional stimulation but as a story, I was just frustrated and annoyed.  Reading a spoiler synopsis of the 3rd book didn't encourage me to continue with the series - rather it convinced me to pack it in and move on.<br /><br />The problem is that the entire story would make much more sense if the experience was taking place inside the minds of the characters as they slept in a Matrix-type storage. But that would be lame.  So placing the story in the real world is much better because it defies that cliche.  But putting Thomas and his friends through trials that seem like they're from a video game is also ridiculous if the reason for doing so isn't good enough.  And the reason for doing so, not to mention the credibility of the resource management required for doing so, isn't good enough.<br /><br />The justification for the suffering of characters (and we the readers as we empathize with them) isn't nearly good enough to make this a satisfying story.
0525951652|5.0|Follet is a masterful writer. He immediately brings you into the period or the situations his characters are in. You are sucked into the lives of these families by his wonderful ability to weave a complex story line. Before you know it you are waiting for more and just can't stop reading.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These headphones are extremely flimsy and lack the kick needed to accurately reproduce music and even speech.  The Sony MDR-A44L was the benchmark of the vertical in-the-ear design.  It's a shame that Sony discontinued the MDR-A44L in favor of the overly cheapened MDR-W08L.
B002OHN5NQ|2.0|Product description states nearly 36 inches. It is only 12 inches like the one that comes with chargers.  If you need a longer wire like I do so I do not have to open the hood each time, this wire does not meet the bill as described

B0030IIZ56|5.0|1995's 'Toy Story' broke new ground in animation and filmmaking. 'Toy Story 2' might not be as much of a milestone, but it makes up for it by being a terrific movie. The amazing voice cast from the original are joined by Estelle Harris, Joan Cusack, Wayne Knight, Kelsey Grammer and Jodi Benson as Barbie.<br /><br />Interesting sidenote about that: Barbie was originally going to be in the first movie, but Mattel, thinking the film would bomb, didn't give Pixar the rights. So they made up a porcelain lamp called Bo Peep instead. Of course, they couldn't WAIT to jump on the bandwagon for the sequel!<br /><br />Anyway, if you liked 'Toy Story,' you'll love 'Toy Story 2' which expands on the foundation laid by the original and takes all your favorite characters beyond infinity in a...no, sorry, I had this whole thing planned but it's just waaay too corny. Look, bottom line: PIxar makes great movies. Pixar made this movie. Ergo, this is a great movie. Nuff said.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book for so many reasons.  Wit, tragedy, love, discovery, selflessness. I will be thinking about it for a long time.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|You know what? I'm not even going to write a review of this movie. You shouldn't need to read a review to help you decide whether or not to buy this movie. All you need is the following five words to convince you to buy it:<br /><br />&#34;A Pixar Animation Studios Film.&#34;<br /><br />That's it. What's stopping you? It's Pixar! Even their bad movies are better than most of the trash out there today. Don't ask your friends what they think, don't rent it first to see if you like it. It's a Pixar movie, which means if you DON'T like it, you might not have a pulse.<br /><br />So buy it...NOW!
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I had this original vinyl recording until 5 years ago when I foolishly sold it while downsizing my studio, I was delighted to see it in CD form.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Sort of the 'Snow White' of Pixar, if you like.<br /><br />'Toy Story' made history by being the first fully computer-animated motion picture ever produced. That in and of itself would have been impressive, but it's also a great movie. When a pull-string cowboy doll meets a delusional spaceman action figure, sparks are sure to fly. But can these two unlikely friends stop bickering long enough to avoid being left behind when their young owner moves away?<br /><br />(Not bad, huh? I should write blurbs like this for a living!)<br /><br />We've all heard or read or seen dozens of stories about toys coming to life when their owners leave the room, from the beloved 'Velveteen Rabbit' to the tragically underrated Jim Henson special 'The Christmas Toy.' But never before has that concept seemed so...well, REAL, for want of a better word. The animation looks a little dated today (compare to the sequel and see how far the technology came in just four years) but the storytelling and performances are still wonderful as are the songs written by music legend Randy Newman. I know I'll be humming &#34;You've Got a Friend In Me&#34; for the rest of my life.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Well put together. Great songs and good quality. Love the story line. I defiantly recommend this movie to every one!

0425252868|5.0|As a writer, avid reader, history buff and daughter of a WWII Naval veteran this book has to be one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Makos captures the rawness of war - the highs, the lowest of lows and the tedium in between.  History books can some times be too technical and dry.  Not this book!  It is pure emotions, facts and excitment.  I couldn't put it down.  Listen up men - if you want to know what you have to do to be a \\"real man\\" read this book.  Oh, the glory days of chivalry and manners!  I wish I had been lucky enough to meet either of these brave pilots, gentlemen and heros.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Some good stuff in this movie, but by the end I was really ready for it to be over.  I was debating turning it off and watching the end in the morning.  Not a good sign.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This was a great read that brought perspective on today's wheat industry and how it is harmfully effecting our health. Very scientific at times, but the overall idea is spectacular.
B0089XH38M|5.0|My uncle turned me on to this product originally for my computers - he repairs computers and scolded me for not having a decent antivirus once my free trial of the expensive one ran out.  I have had excellent luck with this antivirus product and when I found it for my android phone and my tablet I was ecstatic!!  I hadn't thought of putting and antivirus on those, but as soon as I saw this was available for them, I knew I had to have them.  Highly recommend!
B001JU4S44|5.0|The mission impossible movies always deliver.  There is good action and a great story line.  Check it out for yourself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site and having it available on my tablet is even better because I can use it on the go.  It would be on my android phone too if I had more memory on the darn phone LOL.  I can find new craft ideas, sewing and knitting patterns or recipes to try, I can mark them to share with my friends and to try later and I can post ideas that I find as I surf the web.  Great idea!! Recommend this to everyone!

B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show. Even though it's totally far fetched, I still could not stop watching it. It is a show you have to watch from the first season, but you will go through them quick!

B0086700CM|5.0|When my dad first bought me this game for free on the kindle fire Hd, I was so in love with the game!! There is no glitches in the game at all,and like other people said,it's so addicting. One time I was playing for, 2 hours on the game and I was getting a lot of points. My brother loves the game,my dad loves the game,and I love the game,to!!!!!!!!!!! Teenagers at my school like the game to,one of my best friends at school,loves the game. He was playing on my kindle at school during lunch and he just loves the game.<br /><br />The best thing is that this game was free!!!! Get the game now!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app does what it says, you get a nice little background photo to represent each sound, it's easy to select different sounds (good interface), and you get quite a variety.  Looks like they coded it so you can go download additional sounds as well.  Pretty sure some of the sounds won't be very relaxing to most (like the actual white noise sounds and some of the others), but you're sure to find at least a couple that are probably soothing to you.  Personally I've enjoyed the thunderstorm and water sounds.  Obviously the sound clips are looped so they'll keep playing as long as you have it on, so they do get repetitive.  I think it could be better if the clips were slightly longer or could be pieced together in a way to make it have more variety optionally.  But this app behaves as it's described and produces some nice sounds.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A real page turner. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Ending was odd though. Makes you want to sleep with one eye open....
B001AOKA3W|3.0|We waited to watch this until this year (2013), so all the hype was over and there were many varying reviews already out.  Given that, I'm pleased to have finally seen this, and both the storyline and quality were about what I was expecting going in, so I wasn't particularly disappointed with it.  I'm a fan of JJ Abrams and heard he had some involvement with this.  In true Abrams form we don't really find out what the heck is going on, but figured that going in.  This is from the perspective of a character with a video camera obsession, hence some blair witch style camera movement, be aware of that in case that motion makes you queasy.  This is a monster movie of course, but the monsters themselves aren't so much the focus as the experience of the group of friends in the situation, so don't expect super awesome transformers or aliens level graphics or scenes.  You WILL need to keep a solid suspension of disbelief going since the monsters aren't explained, and also because the people are able to survive some rather extraordinary physical traumas.  Most of the poignant scenes are things you'll have seen from other movies or read in scenes in books, which is probably why people were disappointed initially.  All in all it was entertaining enough, I don't regret watching it, and when you have your expectations set properly going in it's not as disappointing as some reviews suggest, the initial marketing just hyped it far too much when it was initially released.
0143038583|1.0|This book presents a very weak argument that is supported with \\"facts\\" that turn out to actually be opinions because they are unsupported scientifically. \\"Professional Aggie\\" has written an excellent review on this book, in fact, there is a long discussion about it here on Amazon presenting both sides of the issue. It is worth a read and you will get more out of the discussion on Amazon than out of reading the book...you'll save money, too.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Good movie, some might say a modern Quicksilver due to the bike messenger action.  You've got a nod to current bike culture with the debate between the typical geared/brake bike set-up versus the hip &#34;fixie&#34; culture now with no gears/brakes.  Also a very tiny cameo of a modern dirt jump mountain bike.  Aside from the bikes, you get a story line that is pretty much what you'll be expecting from the previews, no real surprises or twists, but good none-the-less.  I would say this is kind of a light action-drama (most of the action will be from the bike scenes), with plenty of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (he's a good actor and we enjoy most of his movies, so if you're a fan you won't be disappointed).  On a random side note, we immediately noticed that his voice seemed deeper in this movie for some reason.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather is the most accurate forecast I have found on the web and this app makes it quick to check.  Intuitive and easily navigable.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|...wonderful. useful app that just tells you what you need to know that the stupid battery icon can't. it is free as well so how can you argue with that?
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love this CD!! Emeli Sande is a breath of fresh air.  It is very rare when I love every track on a cd.  Not since Adele have I enjoyed a cd this much.  This is a must a buy.  Sande voice is differenct..majestic.  She is a real singer. Love love love it!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have had this watch about 3 weeks. I have not had a watch GPS device for running before so a required and expected learning curve was experienced. After I learned how it worked, it was easy to operate. It lets me record how long I have exercised and how fast I ran. You must wait for it to find the satellites in order for the GPS to work. It averages your speed, so it does not instantly record a faster pace if you are running a short distance but you can see the pace later on the website that records your runs. (and many other stats)  It is more accurate than any other measure I have used including free apps for the IPOD. I am almost 62 and run to keep fit and trim, not to win a race. I like to record how long, how far and how fast. The watch works well for that purpose.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game i like moving up in levels. it helps pass time by when you are just sitting around waiting.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|mars attacks made me laugh, which is why I likes it. I likes it because it makes us laugh, yes it does.
B006LR0XLM|3.0|Went through the motions and download warned me it wouldn't work, downloaded anyway, wouldn't install. Didn't work for me as downloaded from Amazon, but it was available at Dropbox which works fine. I ended up not using it at all though because of the privacy issues. I don't need my stuff floating around in a Cloud.
B003YL4KS0|3.0|I'm so glad I purchased this book it certainly helped me understand my type of curly hair and how to care for it appropriately. My hair has never looked better.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book is amazing. This is my favorite book in the series. Definitely good for a action packed book lover.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Poorly made! Waste of my time. I would not watch it ever again - There was no story line - the best part of the show was shown through its previews.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I absolutely love this app. It is so amazing, but on survival it would be nice to start with weapons or something but other than that I love it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Handier than going to your computer.  Much faster to retrieve. Can check on may locations in seconds for temperature, weather map for radar and clouds.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this book, not much into the fantasy stuff, but it was a good story and I found myself at the edge of my seat at the end. It was reminiscent of those popular series of books from that one English lady...what was her name again...oh yea, J.K Rowling and Harry Potter! I think most people will enjoy this world the writer of this book brings us to.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Very handy to have around.  Would recommend it to everyone. Easy to use.  Anyone that has an adding machine will find this calculator much easier.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book has a cliché teen romance novel cover but it is so much more. I read this book because John Green recommended it on his blog and he is one of my favorite authors. There is romance but there is a lot of depth to this more unique story. It is intelligent and witty, I was reminded of Green 's style of writing in this way. I would recommend this to anyone, especially fans of John Green novels, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and other young adult books that go beyond said category.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its Got basically the same mechanics but with some much needed variety of scenery and new ways to save yourself and such. I took away a star beacause its a little clunky and just not as addictive as the first I mean we have all seen this before but still is fun to run endlessly hoping maybe if even there is an escape.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|I have read most of the series with Harry Bosch as the main character. Stories are always full of suspense, well constructed and easy to read.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is an amazing box set with a great low price. I love it. Beats the Blu-Ray box set by far
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is an amazing one! I believe that anyone who holds  a passion for horses will also love the game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoyed the first temple run but I love this one and can't stop playing it..I absolutely love this one and think it's so much better then the first one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|JUST SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY MORE ITEMS WIT H COINS INSTEAD OF GEMS OR WAYS TO GET FREE GEMS BESIDES SIGNING UP FOR CREDIT CARDS OR DOWNLOADING SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR BUT I LOVE TAKING CARE OF MY HORSE
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing I felt \\"infinite\\" while reading it! I recommend it to anyone who loves a great book! READ IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT
B00A757EFW|2.0|pac-man-lite<br />i found if to difficult to control on the kindle does not respond fast enough to make the game fun
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love all the Ken Follett books I have read!  World Without End was intriging and suspensful.  It was hard to put down.
0765325950|5.0|Delivery was timely.  The final Wheel of Time book has been along time coming.  Can't wait to see how it ends. If you haven't read the first 13 books before reading this one.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is a fantastic book as well as all Ken Follett's books that I have read.  It was hard to put down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. Surprised it isnt a top 10 the NY best seller .  What a great opportunity for writers and, now that i think about it,  never mind the NY best seller list. The world has changed for good writers thanks to Amazon. Can't wait for the next episode.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Without facebook you can't make it far in this game unless you buy invest points, which are way over priced. It's addictive but I would never put money into a game so you have to wait around instead.
B0063IH60K|5.0|no issues on kindle fire or kindle hd.  ads are not intrusive.  game always functions well.  it is a good basic solitaire.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I have seen first hand that kids who are engaged with &#34;angry birds&#34; begin to think it's ok to be angry over everything. They react with hostility over the simplest things.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love movies about horses!  War Scenes were of course just great and this is a movie that I will want to see more than once.  That is why I ordered it.
B0086O4FLC|5.0|This is yet another side of Pat Metheny. You can see live versions of the tunes on this album on youtube and he's just brilliant.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It was an entertaining time travel flick. Different from most TT's. I did find some parts confusing, but that's ok.. it will just make me watch it a few more times to figure out the time-line threads. There were what appeared to be some flaws in the TT logic, but it was pretty close.
B001H5U232|5.0|I have no idea what the connection between Pat Metheny and Anna Maria Jopek is but this album is fantastic. I have no idea what she's singing about but her voice is a great match for Metheny's guitar.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|i basically bought this for the cup song and one or two others wish i had just bought the one song
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|It was a great story line and I thought it covered how hard it was live back in the days alcohol was illegal.
0061900656|5.0|It's very hard to prepare a small child for the arrival of a new baby, but a toddler is the right audience for this book. My son is two, and I think although he may not understand that we'll be bringing a baby home soon, he does understand that he is different, bigger, and older than a baby so it seems as good a book as any to prepare him for the changes ahead just right for his age.
B00APUQPX6|3.0|Would not rent again for $5 maybe rent for a dollar $1. It is your choice. The others were better
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|As many have noted, this was completely mismarketed as a comedy, and I can't imagine who made that decision, as it set it up for failure. Once I got past that, I was able to appreciate the masterful performances Streep and Jones give in this movie as a 'mature' couple struggling to rekindle the intimacy in their marriage through an intensive counseling program run by Steve Carroll's character. Jones is outstanding as the gruff, stoic, uncommunicative and often angry husband who reluctantly faces emotions long repressed. The few comic moments are his, as he blusters along, and at times finds the wry humor of the situation. Streep is always fun to watch, and is mostly earnest and heartfelt in this film. They both mug just a little, but it's enough to keep it entertaining without it going overboard. Carroll mostly plays it straight and does a great job with his therapist role. The insights on marriage are so true, and will resonate with anyone who's been married for a period of time.  There are some flaws in the movie - some of the contemplative scenes seem very cliche, with music booming while the characters stare remorsefully out over the sea, but other than that it is spot on. And I applaud a movie like this getting made - there aren't many films getting made about romance between characters over 50. So once it is all said and done, I have to give this 5 stars for originality of theme, great performances, and courageous writing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is my first time downloading an app like this and i must say, I'm hooked. Great graphics and storyline. I would definitely recommend.
B001223BLU|5.0|After seeing Jersey Boys I just had to have the original recordings.  This golden record collection was the perfect answer.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|We are Arentinians and we know the real story how it was. The movie is very accurate from all view points. A masterpiece. Hard to find movies like this anymore. The music is outstanding, the landscape is one of the seven wonders of the world, and the characters do a great job. A big praise to the Jesuit work, and a sad reality the attack on what they accomplished. Today only the ruins are left to visit. Still the Guaranies saved their strong faith until today. A beautiful story of redemption and love, and the reality of human affairs that are called sin, hate, avarice and violence. But there is always hope, and the boold of the martirs will always give fruit.
B00AQK4EWY|5.0|So far its brilliant. Im only a beginner but the french is translatable if you use an english translation with it.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Fascinating... Loved it!  Great background material well presented.  Made an already great story even more interesting.  Highly recommend to anyone.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am using this as the translation for the french edition (kindle) and it is very close to the original.text.

B005K17RU0|4.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase of this product.  I enjoyed using Amazon to purchase it and received it with no issues.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Played this game for two days and the more coins I got and the further I got in the game the slower the game got until it finally just would not open at all. VERY Dissapointed :(
B001H1UQZU|1.0|The DVD was scratched and would not play. It was a very poor quality product. I don't know if the movie is good or not since I could not see it.
B0016CTX68|5.0|For Me this is the is the time period in the Stones career when they release some of their most important and rememberable<br />songs.Gimme Shelter,Midnight Rambled,and You can't get what you want are the obvious choices,but when you add in cuts like love in vain,You got the silver and Monkeman,you have what can only be called a masterpiece!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is 8 and loves this app.  Just wish it was completely free. She is an avid horseman, so this is great for her.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a really good game. it is cool that it has zip line and a mine. it is fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all these games! They're sooo fun to play and they're very fun to play too. I recommend playing these games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game and I have it for the xbox so I had a idea already of how to play but you guys should buy it because it is so awesome who would have thought that a block game would be so amazing and awesome
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game was very fun until it started force closing and now I can even open the game. I'm very disappointed now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome!!!!!! trust me, I was addicted to the first one for months, but this one is even better!!! it is way more challenging with waterfalls, minecarts, a huge monkey, and ziplines!!!! please get it, I can't believe its free! I would pay $5 for this app!!! luv it!!! :D
0307744434|4.0|I've read a bunch of reviews on here, and this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it book. I personally loved it, but I understand why many did not.<br /><br />I've noticed that most of the people who didn't love it seem to have one major complaint: \\"Nothing much happens.\\" Also, \\"only the two main characters are fleshed out.\\" Here's the thing: I'm fairly certain that these people went into this book believing it to be a fantasy. I don't blame them for thinking that, at all, and there are reasons that I don't blame them which I'll go into in a moment, but still... they're wrong. It's not a fantasy novel. It's a supernatural romance.<br /><br />The difference between a fantasy novel and a supernatural romance is that fantasy is focused primarily on world-building, and on plot. Characterization and emotion may or may not be very important to the author, but world-building and plot are always AT LEAST as important as characterization and emotion, in a fantasy novel. In a supernatural romance, however, like all romances, the primary focus of the book is to evoke the desired emotion in the reader. Plot is secondary, and is actually considered optional. And world-building in a supernatural romance must be done, but not nearly to the extent it must be done in fantasy. Even characterization is only really necessary for the protagonists; the rest can just be supporting characters. As long as a romance evokes the desired emotion (in this case, mainly childlike wonder) in the reader, it has done its job.<br /><br />Somebody who starts a book expecting a fantasy story and getting a supernatural romance instead is bound to be disappointed in the lack of plot. Especially when the storytelling is deceptive, as it is here.<br /><br />Like I said, I do not blame people for reading this book and thinking they were reading a fantasy, and being bored as a result. I don't blame them for this reason: most romances in general, for good reason, are either told in the first person, or in the third person omniscient. Since the goal of a romance is *usually* to get the reader to identify so strongly with the protagonist that they feel what the protagonist feels, these are the points of view that make the most sense. Authors of romance very rarely deviate from that; you normally only see really creative points of view in fantasy and sci fi. But Night Circus isn't like that; it alternates between a weird third-person kind of half-omniscient, half-objective that I've never seen before (told in the present tense, no less), and interludes told in the second-person. It's weird. But it WORKS! Boy, does it ever work, in getting you to feel for the two (or three) main characters, and especially in getting you to experience the wonder of it all.<br /><br />If I'd read this expecting and wanting a plot-heavy fantasy novel, my reading experience probably would have been far more negative. As it was, I found the book in the \\"supernatural romance\\" section of the card catalogue of my library. I was in the mood for a supernatural romance, I signed up for a supernatural romance, and what I got was an incredible ride, VERY creatively-told, filled with fantastic imagery and relatable protagonists. I absolutely loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was by far one of the best in the series. I follow Greek mythology and he has captured everything myth and legend beautifully. I do look forward to reading book four The House if Hades.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It forces the medical profession to &#34;think outside the box&#34;.  The experiences described in book provide for active group discussions.

B005544V6A|4.0|New twist on boy meets world.<br />  1) Boy is struggling prodigy w/ photographic memory living with & taking care of ailing grandmother.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this app. The horses are so realistic; I have a horse of my own outside, and this game I like to play on rainy or cold days. It works very smoothly, and is just....wow.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|All the people who gave this season negative reviews wouldn't be able to even know how to make a good show themselves. Yes, the show has drama. Thats because if they kept putting action all the time, the writers would be out of ideas. For this season 2, the action and thrilling sequences were correctly placed. Having viewers get to know the characters more, including the new ones. I was blown away by this series. It doesnt seem to disappoint (well, only a few people that only want action which is stupid if you ask me). Dont let some of these negative reviews steer you away from season 2, because from reading some of their nonsense, a few of them didn't even watch the whole thing to judge the season in its entirety.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have been an avid reader my entire life and it takes an exceptional book to grab me the way this one did. It had twists and turns that were totally unexpected. It made me laugh and it made me cry. Highly,  highly recommend. I wish I could give it even more stars!
086571701X|5.0|I was interested in aquaponics and wanted to know more. I bought this book and it helped me explore different systems, how to's, answered questions, etc. It is responsible for my addiction to aquaponics and agreat resources in helping me set up my system
B0056369RO|5.0|Yes, the songs are immature and mostly about partying. This song is not meant for youth, hence the parental advisory. It's an album for adults who like to have fun.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I put battery pro on my daughter`s kindle in hopes it would encourage her not to drain the battery completely, it didn't work. More chargers in convenient locations fixed that problem. But my wife the self proclaimed &quot;full charge cop&quot; loves it. At a glance she can see what can be done for how long. How cool is that?  Very cool!<br /><br />&quot;
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|How on earth does doing the same thing over and over again not get old? Not since Angry Birds has a game been this entertaining. It's the same level, over and over again with the obstacles and vehicles switched. You get to collect coin and improve yourself (or decorate yourself if that's what floats your boat). You have to complete challenges that the game sets for you to collect stars to improve your rank. Challenges like fly over 20 zappers in one game, so it doesn't get old.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 is the best time travel book I have ever read!  I could not put it down - the suspense and vivid detail of Mr. King' s writing is just perfect.  Please do yourself a favor and get this book!
B005IKZ1B0|4.0|This album isn't just OK, it's very OK. I like quite a few of the songs, but I have no trouble skipping over several as well. My favorite to skip over is Will.i.am's Nothing Really Matters, I hope you enjoy skipping over this track as much as I do. Lunar has got to be my favorite track; though it's kind of repetitive, it's still enjoyable. The others I like are Titanium and I Can Only Imagine. I've actually never heard Lil Wayne rap before, I had no idea he didn't rap in English, it really brings some culture to the song. I do think they should've waited for him to get over his nasty cold, though.
B00B6MAXS0|5.0|The comments that you are scrolling through are 1,000% accurate. This season is the best one that has come out yet and includes more unexpected climatic events than seen in the original trilogies and prequels. This appeals to all ages and Star Wars fanatic or not, this show is visually inducing and the depiction of the characters offer another side to Star Wars that's never been seen before. This show is a \\"must watch\\" if you love anything pertaining to creativity. It'll be very exciting to see J.J. Abrams expand on this hidden gem that is well deserving of more publicity!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly, I couldn't put it down! Great story line, written beautifully, but the ending sucked! I mean this wasn't a spiritual or contemplative book, why not give it a closure it deserved? Is there suppose to be a sequel? Great book getting ruined by a bad ending
B004J8HRDC|1.0|This is just Darwin's book and this clown has the &#34;audacity&#34; to add his name and then charge $20.00!!!!!! I recommend going elsewhere with your money.
B006MGDVIY|4.0|A very powerful movie. Hardly fair in its approach to the politics and rivalries involved, though. Still a must-see for F1 fans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 it is amazing and so addicting.It is an awesome game for anyone. Bug be aware VERY addicting!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it.  you can keep playing unlocked games for points to unlock new levels.  helps to pass the long snowy days
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!  I only read this book to see what all the hype was about and soon found myself sucked into a world of pain and grief.  A real page turner.  I could do without all the sex that can only possibly exist in literary fiction but an excellent book.  I am fifty shades ready for more.
B004TI5N38|4.0|The writing, as always with Baldacci, is superb-he knows how to tell a story. I don't really know the reason, but John Puller didn't excite me. I guess I'm just not in the market for another military crime investigator hero. It took me little more than a day to read this book which is pretty much my normal for an ordinary book.  I liked the story, it was entertaining, but not like the captivating and gripping stories in his earlier novels. The quirky characters like those of The Camel Club in some of his earlier books are more endearing.  However, even The Camel Club had definitely reached  it's expiration date. My all-time favorites are The Winner and Saving Faith: five-star books with stories that stand on their own.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|wish there was a little more to maybe entice me to purchase full game but fun and a good challenge.
B009B0L324|5.0|Took my Wife (47) back to her 20's with the help of a Beringer 2000 watt amp, Harmon Karden and four JBL CF-150 Loudspeakers.

B009POCG2C|5.0|It seems that age has finally caught up with cantankerous Atlanta Braves baseball scout Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood)--even if he refuses to admit it. With his eyesight failing, Gus reluctantly accepts some help from his estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), who accompanies him on the road as he sets out on one last assignment to draft a batting phenom. Is it too late for father and daughter to reconnect? Justin Timberlake, John Goodman also star in this bittersweet drama. This shows that Clint still has it. The cast in this was great. Well worth the time and money.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Seems neat so far.still early but hidden object games are fun either way you cut it. No problems on kindle fire so far either
B00942S4OY|4.0|The nine-year-olds, that is. I bought it for my daughter's birthday, and then had to hear it blasted from her stereo from downstairs for most of the day. I'm kind of tired of it myself, but she apparently can listen to it incessantly without adverse effects. I guess it's a good CD. Not typically my kind of music.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like it much better on an actual computer.  The updates are more recent and the pictures posted by other people are easier to view on the computer vs. the Kindle Fire.  But, it's not terrible.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|But I got this for my daughter, who loves her. This is a good album, which Taylor typically puts out in standard fashion. Lots of pictures of her inside, trying to look sexy and whatnot. She's a little too young to be thought of that way, if you ask me though. The music is good. A whole lot of telling some boy she's done with him and whatnot. Maybe, after four albums of singing songs about breaking up, she should consider the possibility that she is the problem...<br /><br />Good music though. Worth the money.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|LastPass is an excellent software to save all your passwords and usernames. It is easy to use. The price is well worth it. I love that I can have LastPass on all my devices (computer, mobile, Kindle, etc.). They all sync with each other. LastPass is great at creating unique, hard to guess passwords. No more thinking up passwords.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost my kindle charger a while ago, and recently realized that I could just order a new one on amazon :) charger was exactly matched the description, and it shipped fast.
1423124960|5.0|My daughter loves this book. She really enjoys reading all the princess stories. I love how they prepare her for bed and are not scary in the lease bit. I would definitely recommend this book for the princess lover.
0321885112|5.0|I've been following Mike Rohde's blog and social media for a couple of years now, and have been looking forward to The Sketchnote Handbook since he announced it in March of 2012.<br /><br />My expectations were high--which has often lead to disappointment in the past.<br /><br />Not this time, though: The Sketchnote Handbook is like a breath of fresh air, a detailed introduction to the advantages of visual note taking and a step-by-step guide to getting started.<br /><br />It's also a visual treat; no 2 pages are the same, and the combination of concise, conversational text and engaging graphics makes for a great reading experience. If possible, I encourage you to get the print edition, which is beautifully printed on a heavy matte paper with heavy covers.<br /><br />One of the surprises in the book were pages produced by other sketchnoters. Their contributions add interesting voices, perspectives, favorite tools, and a variety of note-taking styles.<br /><br />In terms of the \\"total package,\\" The Sketchnote Handbook is one of the 2012's most interesting books.
B007XHWROK|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this cd!  She was so happy to get it for Christmas.  She plays the cd all the time and sings along with the songs.  I love the positive messages that the songs send!
B008NR8YXC|5.0|This was a Christmas present for myself, after hearing excerpts on various NPR stations.<br /><br />Although I've been enjoying the Glenn Gould recordings for decades, along with Wanda Landowsky's harpsichord recordings, I find myself frequently replaying this version.<br /><br />There's new life in the performance, previously-overlooked details emerge, and the sound quality is thrilling on good equipment. This is a safe bet for anyone looking for new pleasures and perspectives from familiar music.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was a very fast and interesting book.  I did not want to put it down. I am looking forward to the next installment of the Trilogy.
1926778537|5.0|This art book is great. It has tons of art everywhere and they improved the binding from the the previous DS art book. It's  amust buy if you loved the art in the game. It has a lot info of the whole process and it has a good amount of art on everything, characters, environments, monsters, weapons, etc.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Addicted from the very first episode!  quirky, silly, entertaining.  It is my new favorite show!  I highly recommend this show.
0452295548|5.0|I chose this book as it was recommended by a nurse to bettter understand happenings of a stroke.  Since I have a loved one that recently suffered a stroke  this book is wonderfully written in laymen terms & is helping me to better understand the process & progress of a stroke patient.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|this movie, along with all other Tim Burton movies, is twisted and strange! it is dark, the characters are, well.....strange, and the meaning behind the story is teaching our children that what we want in life is more important than valuing the gift of life.  With all the dystopian, end of the world, survival fiction that has become the rage of teens and young adults.....I feel animating a story such as this is introducing this harmful fiction to a very young audience that cannot understand &#34;FICTION&#34;.  Now we will have young kids acting out what they learned from this movie, and thinking that we can bring their dead pet back to life and live happily ever after.  So disappointed by the lack of better judgement and character of all who made this film.....this was not the proper audience for this fictional story.  Messing with life after death is just not a happy ever after story!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a slow paced game but very fun and runs really smooth. I really like it but I don't like that you have to buy things to make it move along faster.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is totally awesome I love how you can do so many things at the same time and how you don't have to buy stuff to play. :)
B009AMANBA|4.0|My son has to do a big report about Abraham Lincoln in school this week and Daniel Day-Lewis seems born to play Lincoln. So I broke my resolution not to see another Spielberg movie (see my review of \\"Schindler's List\\" if you're interested) and the whole family went to see \\"Lincoln.\\" This is, I think, very much a lawyer's movie, and my verdict is \\"not great, but not bad at all.\\" Four stars.<br /><br />\\"Lincoln\\" wisely does not attempt to offer a sweeping account of the 16th U.S. president's remarkable life and times in its two and a half hour running time. Rather, through its focus on efforts to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery, it offers a character study of Lincoln as arm-twisting political strategist, Commander in Chief, folk philosopher, husband and father.<br /><br />For a Speilberg movie, \\"Lincoln\\" is remarkably quiet. We do see gruesome piles of bodies on the Civil War battlefields, and the requisite Spielberg bursting into song at the moment of triumph. (\\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" is sung on the floor of the House of Representatives after the vote passing the amendment. Contemporary northern newspaper accounts I was able to find indicate that there was much exultation and cheering on the House Floor and around Washington after the vote, but I didn't see anything about Congressmen bursting into song.) In a highly unlikely scene, a racially mixed pair of Union soldiers recites Lincoln's Gettysburg address to him when meeting him so that bit of brilliant oratory can be fit into the movie without taking it out of its early 1865 time frame.<br /><br />Overall, though, Tony Kushner's literate and often stylized script gives us intimate scenes of  Lincoln's interactions with his high-strung wife Mary Todd, with his son Robert, and with his troops. Most screen time is taken up with meetings between Lincoln and his advisers about the need for the amendment as both a legal matter to ensure slavery doesnot continue after the war and as a step to expedite the war's end, the timing for its passage (before the Southern States are back and able to vote it down), and how to get enough votes from among lame-duck Democratic Congressmen who have been voted out of office to pass the amendment. These detailed analytical discussions will appeal to political junkies and legal scholars, but they may drag a bit for the more casual viewer. Our ten-year-old was fidgety and made frequent trips to the water fountain outside the auditorium.<br /><br />Lincoln is beautifully cast so we enjoy a number of remarkable supporting performances: David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward, Sally Field as the neurotic Mrs. Lincoln, Jackie Earle Haley as Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, and best of all to my taste, Tommy Lee Jones as radical anti-slavery Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, to name a just few.<br /><br />Day-Lewis is off on another planet as Abraham Lincoln, which is both a brilliant piece of acting and, at least for me, somewhat off-putting. While he does a lovely job capturing Lincoln's intellect, political savvy, folksy humor and cynicism, because he has gone so far away into his character, I often felt that he was calling out to the other characters from a great distance rather than interacting intimately with them. The performance might have worked better in a one-man show. The makeup used to create the deep furrows in his brow seemed strangely immobile.<br /><br />Through \\"Lincoln\\" we learn, if we did not already know, that passing controversial legislation is a long hard slog through the mud. It's a great challenge to dramatize a long hard slog through the mud, even when the result is as world-changing as the end of slavery. \\"Lincoln\\" does the job about as well as can be expected. I have nothing but praise for Spielberg's keeping a curb bit on his mawkish manipulative tendencies and crowd-pleasing instincts in this smart, well-made movie that will not be to everyone's taste.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I saw this movie in theatres, and though I'm not sure why, I liked it more than the other three.  The same amount of action is present, though with a lot more gore than I remember from the previous films.  Beckinsale doesn't disappoint as Selene, and the addition of new characters (especially Michael Ealy's) is refreshing for such a concentrated series.  Some aspects are unbelievable, of course, but all in all, it's a fun, entertaining movie with just enough heart to make you want to know what happens next.
B000062V9C|1.0|It does not work! Apparently, there are different regions in the world for DVD players. To the average person, like me, I did not know this! This DVD will only work in South America! But here is the funny thing, the company that sells it is here in the USA. Don't waste your money or time. They are allowing to return but I have to pay for the return shipping.
B008220C38|5.0|To date, I have seen this movie three times, and cannot wait to finally own this DVD.  Though many didn't like the way this movie was done, I thought it was inventive, and certainly held my attention.  The characterisations from the book to the movie are spot on, especially Matthew MacFayden's Stepan Oblonsky and Jude Law's Alexei Karenin.  Beautiful masterpiece of a movie if I've ever seen one.
B00846REIS|4.0|I was excited to start reading this book as it was suggested to me after reading Fifty Shades of Gray. The Crossfire novels are just as exciting, if not more so, and I was happy to hear about both of them having issues with their past that they had to work through. I would recommend this book to anyone who couldn't put down Fifty Shades of Gray or someone looking for a book that will keep their interest with every page.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My whole family enjoys this show. We can hardly wait in between episodes. There is so much going on in each episode that you may want to go back and re-watch it to see how all of the pieces went together. Whoever wrote this script was a genius! I have to guess that all the episodes were written before production because so many characters intertwine even with the first show! Bottom line? We apsolutely love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't heard that term since the days before DVR and such. 'Downton Abbey' IS the kind of program you work your schedule around. Each week, it's so exciting to see how events progress through what characters say and do. I truly love it, and I am happy that so many people all around the world are watching this fabulous show!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The book was a little confusing at first but as you went along it all became obvious.  I enjoyed the movement of the plot and the characters kept things moving.  It was alot better than the last book and had an interesting plot.  Of interest was that I lived in the Peace Region of Northern Alberta and it kept me going.  I enjoyed the book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its actually an okay game till u run out of diamonds and cannot buy anymore..... other then that it is fun
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book to learn more about yourself and your partner. Comes with discussion questions to start talking and communicating openly about the different ways to be loved and express love.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I enjoyed the fight scenes in this flick, I'm not really intrested in the storyline or character development etc. After seeing the axe in motion to battle vampires was good enough for me.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season two is very different from season one, but equally as good. A must see for horror fans.<br /><br />Possession, aliens, corrupt nuns and priests and much more..
B005NQ5LQ4|4.0|To be honest, I only prefered a couple of fight scenes in this flick 'not keen on story telling flicks' but what made me purchase this version 'region 1' was purley due to the sleeve print. It has a true meaning / feeling to the flick.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|The best Doctor Who ever.  You will enjoy all the clear detail of the Blu-ray.  Brings all the extras to you
B007G92QGO|4.0|Great read from start to finish, very interesting story. Would recommend to all. First time to read this author & will make sure I read some more.
B0018M6J90|5.0|One of the best chick flicks to come along in a long time.  Cute funny and even has a moral to the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game keeps me entertained for long time. just wish you could buy more study with coins because gems are hard to get.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Got to love Catherine Tate.  She is by far the best companion.  When it is in Blu-Ray just make a great show better. Enjoy
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Was fast moving and kept me guessing the whole time.<br />Definitely recommend to anyone who has enjoyed previous Grisham novels.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Best upgrade you will have for those who love STNG.  Can not wait for the next seasons to come available
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good book. Good love story but some what predictible but I'm a sucker for a good love story to read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is very fun and addicting! I just love feeding the horse and taking care of it too! FUN
B00A77II0U|2.0|its taking 3 hours for it to download and it still hasn't and I really would like to play it today
B0063GORYU|5.0|It's got everything you need to play a great game of spider solitaire.  It's got a few ads, but it's free so it evens out.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I could not sleep with the constant noise.  White Noise may work for some but not for me.<br />Will try another app to see if that works
B007ZXK08C|5.0|In one word \\"Brilliant\\". I was looking for a unputdownable book and read about it on the Amazon list. What a find. Beautifully constructed plot and characters. Love to hate them and in the end don't know who to sympathise with! Keeps you guessing (though I guessed a bit:)) Lyrical at times especially its take on soulmates and single child. And what a take on marriage! A great book for any thriller buff. Actually a must try for anyone. Read it in a day flat. That good. Though the end could have been shorter. Dragged a bit.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|This book was on the best sellers list and has good reviews.  I made it 60% of the way through the book before I gave up.  I haven't read a book by this author before, but his style of writing is not for those with short attention spans.  The author consumes the reader with with an abundance of detail where it is not needed--and skips over highly important parts using just a sentence.  The author is completely at fault with this failure of a book.  The description and the story are both solid; The author's inability to tell a story effectively washes away any desire to finish the book.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|This was a good movie. The story was a little strange. But I very much think it was worth the watch. I will probably rent this again to watch with my girlfriend.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|unless you get one of their remix albums, all their regular albums are amazing.  Very talented group.  Wish they would have kept from cussing so much in the newer stuff.  Can't listen to it around the kids.  I hope they read this and go back to less bad words.  Still a good album.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson completed an unprecedented task with dexterity.  I wouldn't have thought it would be possible for him to do such a good job.  I wish there were still more books to come...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was never a zombie fan, but after the video game left 4 dead and left 4 dead 2, man I love this show.  I can't wait for the rest of this season.  If you like zombies at all I highly recommend it!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|My kids liked it a lot, I didn't watch it, but trust their movie critic knowledge. It's funny, has the usual crisp visuals and kid friendly story line.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I bought this for my 6 year old grandaugter.  She likes it but it needs more pieces to make it fun to put things together.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Haven't played it all that much, but when I have played, it's really a lot of fun. Can understand them and the bingo speaker doesn't go slow, which is really good.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|great on a big screen tv. great with surround sound audio. Look forward to polar express 2 if there is one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great book, the action is given in the correct dose, It is difficult to stop reading it. Tom Clancy is adictive!!!
B000HT3Q3M|3.0|I love both these guys so I won't say much for fear of having my Benson, Jarreau jazz card revoked. These songs were too relaxed and many too pop oriented. Neither Jarreau, with his vocals nor George, with his guitar had a chance to fly and do what we've come to love from them. At least one blazing duet would have done many of us die hard fans fine. But it was not to be found anywhere. In my opinion the best song from the entire project is the accompaniment with Jill Scott and even that is fair. I anticipated this project for years but deeply disappointed at the outcome.
B001O8D47S|4.0|It was a very good movie and it was very intriguing and once I started watching it was impossible to turn it off
B007OAAK0O|2.0|I've only been in love with a few of Diana's songs mostly from the supreme era. When solo she seemed to be focused more on primpin' posin' that I very soon lost interested. She talked and shouted to the crowd and did little singing. When singing it was half assed. I hated this DVD. I'd never seen it before and bought it for my partners enjoyment. I now wish my eyes never had.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great game to pass the time with while awaiting the next flight, bus or metro. Fais attention: can be addictive
B004INNRFK|4.0|I like most of the guests. The performances were good but I think too polished. I like a little impromptu, raw feeling to a performance to really feel the performer in their most vulnerable, unrelenting forceful self. I enjoyed it much but wished It had been a little more relaxed.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Kept you interested in the story. I would recommend to any one to read this book
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Quick read in the beginning, not great not awful.  It started out much better than it finished which is too bad.
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|OK, I really needed this record like a \\"hole in the head\\" as I already have a pristine copy of the \\"last\\" Capitol analog pressing issued a few year ago. It was more curiosity than anything that I picked this up, but the differences are substantial.<br /><br />Let me begin by stating the strengths of the remaster. First off, the record was well pressed and very quiet. In addition, I thought that the packaging was pretty good and was fairly authentic to the original. I bought the British Apple pressing of this record when it first came out.<br />Unfortunately, it disappeared over the years but I remember it distinctly.  Besides the lack of the clear laminate, the cover quality is decent.<br /><br />Now when it comes to the sound quality, this is where things get interesting. In my opinion, the sound of the remaster is \\"good\\" but not great. The most recent Capitol version is more dynamic and detailed. I am not sure what the sound engineers were looking for, but in my opinion they filtered out all the crispness and detail of the previous analog pressings.<br /><br />So, my advice for those who want a new clean vinyl pressing of the record, this may be the ticket as it rates high in that regard. However, if you now possess the last recent analog pressing of Abbey Road, hold on to it as you have a better sounding record than the one that is offered now.<br /><br />The problem with a lot of new vinyl being pressed, is that the mastering is not the same due to the changes in technology. The quality of the vinyl is better, but they they are missing the ambiance that was offered in the older analog recordings.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|i love this band and love this CD, though it's definitely not as great as their first album. But if you're a M7S fan you will love the CD
B0040GYAOM|5.0|The selection of his best 30 was pretty good. Might differ slightly than my own choices but I am still extremely happy with the purchase.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|it's fun for a while but by the time you have it for a month,you leave it and when you get back to it it's HORRIBLE,you feel stupid.
142720599X|5.0|This was a cuter version of Evanovich.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Great condition.  What a joy to read/listen to another book by Janet.
B002ZG999U|5.0|exciting, funny and I love it. really, I have to add a minimum amount of words? I don't have time for this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual Stephen King weaves a masterful story.  If time travel were possible, I would have second thoughts about going after reading this book....
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Love this movie! really, I have to add a minimum amount of words? I don't have time for this. Still not enough?
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift and it was a big hit. I highly recommend this for movie lovers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show I am so hooked on it. There is so much going on that you even forget that its about zombies and the end of the world. If you watch the first season you will be hooked.
0316227706|5.0|I purchased this book as a Christmas gift and it was a big hit. I highly recommend it for anyone.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|It arrived earlier than expected it was a great gift. I would recommend it for someone who loves the MIB movies.
B001EN71CW|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST SERIES EVER NOT TO GET RENEWED FOR A SECOND SEASON AND BLOWS 99% OF THE SERIES OUT THERE THAT LASTED MORE THAN ONE SEASON OUT OF THE WATER.<br /><br />JUST LOOK AT NATHAN FILLION'S POPULARITY WITH CASTLE AND YOU WILL SEE WHY THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE WITH FIREFLY.  THIS SHOULD HAVE EASILY BEEN A 5 + SEASON HIT.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like this ap. ive had one other sleep ap and this ones much easier to figure out. its simple and has plenty of choices. I like rain storm best.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The kids loves it and so do the parents (aka me and the mrs.)<br /><br />However, I wish Amazon would have HD stream for PCs and not only for Kinddle devices. It pushes us to look for the the same content in other places.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|To be honest i didnt fell any tempeture work with that product, people says that is one the best int the market but i think is pretty expensive just for a 3.5g
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I thought it was a good read that kept my interest, but it was not one of those books that you cant put down.
0553382179|4.0|Sink Reflections is written in a \\"smoochy, honey, baby\\" voice, and I think some people are put off by that.  Personally I don't care for that \\"voice\\" in a book, but I do believe the author is very sincere in her desire to help people...and if you follow her directions (take a leap of faith---what have you got to lose??) you can have a consistently cleaner, neater, and more peaceful home.<br /><br />It takes some people longer than others to stick to their routines---we are all different!  I have been at this off and on for five years now, and have come a little farther each time.  By the time I die I hope to have a consistently spotless house ;-))<br /><br />Until then, I enjoy the system, and I have gotten a lot out of it.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|THIS CASE WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...IT DOES NOT FIT THE KINDLE FIRE...AND CAN BARELY GET THE REGULAR KINDLE ...HAVE TO REALLY SQUEEZE IT ..WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THE FIRE COVER THAT AUTOMATICALLY PUTS THE FIRE TO SLEEP WHEN YOU CLOSE IT AND WAKES IT WHEN OPENED...I SAVED ALL THE PACKING MATERIALS BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT SENDING IT BACK FOR AN EXCHANGE...YOU SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE THIS AS FITTING THE FIRE AS IT DOES NOT!!!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Great movie!! Can watch it again and again! DVD was in great condition and I had no problem viewing the movie!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I read the trilogy back to back.  I thoroughly enjoy this joint authorship.  I plan to read more books by them.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Good story line enjoyed it a lot,very twisted,surprise ending,keeper me guessing the whole book ,good character's,vivid writing,l loved it,will read more from this author
1932100660|5.0|WOW !!!  My husband went from being a meateater to vegan over night.  His chloresterol dropped from 180 to 124.  Love the book & we live a vegal lifestyle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If ur reading this GET THE GAME !!! I really like this, it sooo good that i was playing it after my mom told me to go to bed, for like 30 minutes. In fact ive been playing it so much i already have BARRYBONES and scarletfox. Its not as easy as the . Last temple run, but its not too challenging. U SHOULD GET THIS ALL THE GLITCHES PEEPLE R TALKING ABOUT AND ANYTHING Is not  THE GAMES FAULT ITS THERE FAULT!!!!
B009X01ELC|4.0|very happy with this case. Lots of choices, but this one has proved a winner for me for the Kindle Fire HD
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|The multiple notebooks enable me to use major catagories to filter through for memo keeping. I use one for daily to do list.
0345803507|5.0|I just absolutely love this book and the series. Shows just how much people will go through to fight for an ever lasting love, and how far people will fight to end that love
0812984412|3.0|I have never been as conflicted about a book as I have with this one. I read it for a book discussion group,  and forced myself to finish it.  (I was the only one with mixed feelings. All the others loved it.) As I got into it,  the book did improve.  I originally was going to give this two stars,  but, changed my mind to 3 1/2  after getting deeper into the story. The format is dazzling,  and unusual, to say the least.  I loved the Luisa Rey segment,  couldn't stand  the  Korean  futuristic segment,  and found the dialect-heavy  Zachry story hard going.  The others were okay,  but not outstanding. But, in the final analysis. I'm glad I read it.
1401322786|5.0|I recently finished the book, \\"The Time Keeper\\" by Mitch Album. I have read one of Mitch Album's books before, \\"Tuesday's With Morrie,\\" and really liked it, so when he came out with this new book, I was anxious to read it.<br />\\"The Time Keeper\\" is an eye-opening book. It makes you wonder if you are wishing your time away or enjoying the time you have. There are three main characters throughout the book and each faces issues when it comes to time. The first is Dor who later is referred to as, \\"The Father of Time.\\" He has a great life and loses the thing he loves most. All he wants is for his time on earth to be over, so he can be with what he loves. The opposite happens. He never seems to age or get sick and lives for years and years. Victor, an older man, diagnosed with a deadly form of cancer wishes for more time. Sarah, an unpopular teen with self-esteem issues wants her time to be over. After a humiliating event, she can't take it anymore. Dor plays with time and after some important events talks with and shows Victor and Sarah what a blessing time is.<br />This book was very enjoyable to me. In my mind, a good book is one in which you can't put down. You are dying to know what happens next. I had a really hard time putting this book down. It was a great book to keep me busy on a plane. \\"The Time Keeper\\" was also unpredictable to me. I don't like being able to guess the entire book within the first chapter. I like not knowing what is going to happen and be caught off-guard and surprised by events that take place. This book was full of surprises.  Another great aspect of this book is how it is laid out. It jumps from character to character in a way which sparks readers' interest. Albom definitely builds suspense and leaves you hanging, urging you to read on. I like books that make me think about an aspect of my life and see how I'm doing. This book made me realize that sometimes I wish my time away. This book made me want to change for the better. A good book should do that. I honestly cannot think of one weakness this book has. The fact that it ended was pretty sad. I highly recommend this book. I'm pretty picky about the kind of books that I like, and I don't know of anyone that would not like, \\"The Time Keeper.\\"uld do that. I honestly cannot think of one weakness this book has. The fact that it ended was pretty sad. I highly recommend this book. I'm pretty picky about the kind of books that I like, and I don't know of anyone that would not like, \\"The Time Keeper.\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so addicting! players beware. you play it once and you will be hooked forever. you won't be able to put it down.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|loved it. It is way better than tap zoo I have 2 solar eclipses and 3 blue moons 2 gold 1 silver 1 Leap year
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A nice story set in an exotic land with an outstanding cast. Heartwarming but probably wouldn't appeal to young viewers.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Apart from LaBeouf, the acting all round is great. The standout star is, once again, Tom Hardy - great, great actor. Watch it, but don't expect too much.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What an awesome game! Be forewarned - it is an extremely addicting game that consumes a lot your time. Very clever use of a few dots on a simple grid.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|A tired franchise, just gets worse and worse. I would not bother seeing this, even when it comes to TV or Netflix.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When I can learn about another culture, industry or lifestyle through a well-written book, I am most satisfied. This book delivered on that scale like Water for Elephants. A slightly soggy ending, no pun intended, but I recommend it nonetheless.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Simple but fun.<br />Cute animation for a puzzle game. First couple of levels pretty easy, but some more complicated elements get introduced as levels progress.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Gritty, violent, and unapologetic; this is Dredd straight out of the 2000AD comic series.<br />Completely worth a purchase, this movie takes hold of you and never lets go.  Even the &#34;slower&#34; parts of the movie (which aren't many) will keep you watching.  Karl Urban totally nails it as Dredd, and Oliva Thirlby is excellent as Judge Anderson; in fact there isn't really any bad casting in this film.<br />Get it, watch it, and love it!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|HELP!!!! When ever I start the game after a few hours it resumes right where I was when I got off of it. So like I breed an animal and get off of it waiting for the animal to hatch and I get back on later like an hour or two it resumes right where I was when I got off of it so the animal is still at the time when I got off. PLEASE READ AND HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Other than that it's a GREAT game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really adore this game oh my but its a little bit difficult<br />..dont worry when you dont get something try ..try again lml :]]
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|Good four agreements but a totally strange book. Seems to me like someone who has searched & experienced many spiritual paths and still seems lost!
B009X01FJS|4.0|This cover does exactly what I w a noted it to do-- relieve the pressure of holding my Kindle in my arthritic hands.  I can s t nd it up in my lap .edit h Dr direction to play g a mm rd, read, or watch videos.  It was easy to install and is a good protective cover.
B003IDMUWC|5.0|One of Grishams best books. Had me gripped like it was real life though a little scary at the thought of it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's great for passing time! I like the fact that there are so many games. There's something for everyone to play that they will like.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a really good book, I would suggest it to other kids my age and younger, and to the parents go and buy it for your kids.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got this thinking, awsome a new temple run. The first time i opened it, it worked fine. the ln the next day it would just close. Don't recommend for a Kindle Fire.
B0053TMP24|3.0|This book fills out most expectations of the reader. It is much better than any fanfiction of it that I have ever read with complicated situations, romance, mystery, and action all rolled up in one
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I got this video on [[ASIN:B000J103WK HD DVD]] back when that format was viable.  The video quality, and of course the audio quality, of that recording, which is basically ported over to Blu-ray disc for this \\"new\\" release, are top notch.  The performance in this concert was every bit as good as any Eagles fan could ask for.  While I remain personally disappointed that I missed an opportunity to see the Eagles live and in person when they were supposed to have made a concert stop (but didn't :-( ) in my region a few years ago, I had long ago said that if I could finally have this concert performance on Blu-ray that I think I could be relatively happy.<br /><br />While this concert, filmed at the Eagles' 2004 concert in Melbourne, Australia obviously doesn't include any of the tracks (some of my favorite Eagles tracks since their much earlier days) in the [[ASIN:B002Q7JYPC Long Road Out Of Eden]] disc that was released in October 2007, it still features the vast majority of the tracks that I would have hoped to see/hear performed live by the group.<br /><br />Track listing (from the 2005 HD DVD release) was as follows:<br /><br />The Long Run<br />New Kid In Town<br />Wasted Time<br />- Wasted Time<br />- Wasted Time (Reprise)<br />Peaceful Easy Feeling<br />I Can't Tell You Why<br />One Of These Nights<br />One Day At A Time<br />Lyin' Eyes<br />The Boys Of Summer<br />In The City<br />Already Gone<br />Silent Spring (intro)<br />Tequila Sunrise<br />Love Will Keep Us Alive<br />No More Cloudy Days<br />Hole In The World<br />Take It To The Limit<br />You Belong To The City<br />Walk Away<br />Sunset Grill<br />Life's Been Good<br />Dirty Laundry<br />Funk #49<br />Heartache Tonight<br />Life In The Fast Lane<br />Hotel California<br />Rocky Mountain Way<br />All She Wants To Do Is Dance<br />Take It Easy<br />Desperado<br /><br />The Blu-ray release *is* the exact same thing as the HD DVD release of several years ago, just ported over to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Audio quality is very good, and video quality is top notch.  While not quite as nice as being there in person, it is a reasonable alternative and well worth the purchase price in my book.uality is very good, and video quality is top notch.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this game. I love horses have since I was little and now I can own my own. Horses give me comfort when nothing else does. Graphics are amazing not a flaw in sight.

1936608898|5.0|Not a diet per se but a life change.  This is not as hard as you think it will be, but the book will guide you and get you through the cravings - which is what this is all about, ditching the cravings for junk and sugar.  You will feel like a new person at the end of it. Guaranteed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so addicting and the best app ever because you don't need WiFi for this game and I just don't like that they don't say are you sure<br />Toney to but such and such other wise it's a great game
0763650420|5.0|\\"What is all the fuss?\\" is a new saying that my 3 yr old learned from this book.<br />It is kinda cute.<br />If anyone is looking for a new bed time book, I would recommend this book to you all.<br />It is about 3 baby owls and their mother.<br />One night, the babies woke up and their mother is gone.<br />They comfort each other and then wait for her return.<br />Mommy comes home and reinforce that \\"mommy always come back\\".  No need to fuss.<br />This book is especially applicable to the little ones that are transitioning to sleep in their own bed.<br />It sort of gives the message to the little one that \\"if you wake up in the middle of the night and gets scared, don't fuss, go back to sleep and mommy will be there in the morning\\".  It is truly a book that I do not mind reading over and over again.~
B009A9SULS|5.0|she loved it ,and barely put it down .she is addicted to her kobo and downloads her favorite books  she reads all the time now.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game addicting and engaging. Problem is, some times when you try using a gem to save you from death, the game will force close and kick you out. It will still cost you the gem, but it will not save anything you got in that run.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A bit like a human jigsaw puzzle. This novel is very well constructed. Phenomenal writing. Excellent twists. Interesting characters. A bit on the dark side, but isn't that what makes it so intriguing? The writing alone, with Ms. Flynn's metaphors and descriptions, make this worth reading, but to get a great story and several surprises along the way, really put this one over the top. Addictive -- and compulsively readable.
B0046ECFRM|3.0|I am not a young adult but read a lot of YA. This book has been on my radar for a  long time because even older adults like myself recommend it. As a Kindle Daily Deal this week I couldn't refuse. However, though it is a quick and entertaining enough read, I wouldn't recommend to anyone other than teens. The main characters are well written though the secondary characters tend to be stereotypical and not so well fleshed out.<br /><br />The main problem is the predictability. You know from the first bump into each other in the hallway that the main characters are going to get together. The events of the book read to me like a summary of a bunch of women having gotten together and reminiscing about the things that happened to them in high school: tough, unfeeling teacher, crush on a hot guy who thinks more of himself than anyone else, drunken binges, a series of misunderstandings among friends, feeling insecure about yourself and your relationships etc. It's all here. By the end, there was a few twists that made me feel like someone forgot one last dumb thing that happened to them in high school, so she had to go back and throw it in. As insecure as the narrator, Anna, is, I found it unbelievable that she could keep having so many misunderstandings and the high school English lesson that discusses translated works and the interpretation was just too much of a flashing red light of foreshadowing as well as a too convenient summary and review of the main conflict of the novel.<br /><br />One nice thing though was the setting of Paris and the descriptions of places and foods. It's obvious the author has experience in this. However, I think this was done better in Gayle Forman's Just One Day. If you want to read a novel about coming of age set in Paris, that novel is superior.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|What can I say? I think Gillian Flynn is tops! I highly recommend all three of her books. Her descriptions are top-notch. The characters are dark but not depressing. The stories are intriguing. Great writer. Great book.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Rarely do I find an album that I can listen to straight through the first time and love it from start to finish. This album does that. It's a gem.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I love the author's writing style. It's also an interesting story with unique perspectives. For me, some of the descriptions of plants and flowers and surroundings got a bit lengthy, but that shouldn't be a reason not to skip this book. It's a nice story of a man on an unexpected journey. He ends up rediscovering himself and healing old wounds. The character of the wife is also well-developed, and as I said in my headline, the books is very well written.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. The horses are lifelike. It's really endearing the way the horses respond to being petted in the Treat section and I think this game does a great job teaching responsibility of caring for a horse.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I love almost everything Carlos Ruiz Zafon writes, and this book was no exception. Very well written. Great descriptions and dialogue. The beginning of the book doesn't really hint at where the majority of the book takes place, but both settings are enjoyable. If you are a fan of the two books that precede this one, definitely read it. If you are a fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, definitely read it. You certainly don't have to have read the previous two books, but there are a few small references that will make more sense to you if you have read them. Enjoy!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is the first of the hidden object games that i have wanted to purchase the full version.  i've tried others but they didnt keep my attention and challenge me like this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter has enjoyed this game.  It does take time to earn coins and gems if you don't want to pay money for them.  Overall a fun game for a course lover.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I bought this cd for my son for Christmas.  He really loves Nickelback.  This cd has a lot of great songs on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great but addictive game ,I can't put it down. If you have never played this game , you NEED to buy it. Okay just trust me. At first it seems hard but you will get really good.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|GOOD INSIGHT INTO GANDHI AND WHY AND WHAT HE DID. RECOMMEND HIGHLY. A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE. ALTHOUGH CHILDREN UNDER 12 MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL PERIOD AS MUCH AS THE OLDER CHILDREN.

B0010SEMP0|4.0|Very good.  Interesting details and background on vampire law and ghouls.  Kept my interest going and filled in some background.
B004QX07G4|4.0|It is the kind of book you can read while traveling or the like.  It is funny and can be put down and picked up again and enjoyed.
0547848412|3.0|The Journey of Pi<br />The exposition of this book was actually quite a bit of this book. Pretty much the whole beginning of the book is the exposition and the readers get introduced to Pi, his family, and his life. There are also a lot of characters in this novel. The protagonist of this novel is a boy named Pi. He is the novel' narrator for most of the book and he also gets his name from a French word meaning pool. Pi is also a student of zoology and religion. There is also a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker and is a quite a pet for Pi to take care of. Richard also kills the tormentor of the boat which is the hyena and also the blind cannibal that tries to terrorize Pi. There is also the zebra that get eaten alive by the hyena and Orange Juice is an orangutan that gets attacked by the hyena but soon is killed by it. There are also his family members, but they are not important. The main conflict of this story is when the ship gets wrecked and sinks and the catastrophe of that is Pi having to survive the isolation. The internal conflict of this story is Pi religion and that he chose three religions which his parents don't understand. Another one is him losing his humanity in the sense of him eating like Richard and his first time killing a fish. His external conflicts were Mother Nature when the sun beamed on everything making it dysfunctional. The storms were another problem when they had tore his lifeboat apart. The most obvious external conflict was when Pi had to survive with all the animals he had even though most of them died. Even though he had to battle with the animals, he had the skill to protect and take care of the animals which didn't get him killed. I think one rising plot event is when Pi' family sells the zoo. The second example of rising action is probably when Pi and his family get on a cargo ship to Canada.<br />  There are a lot of things I did not like about this novel because I think that it was just too hard to understand. I don't have my book right now so I can't give any specific details about my dislikes and likes. One event I really don't like is the ending, but I won't explain that. You'll have to read it for yourself. One thing I like is how Pi is creative and nice enough to give the animals a name and try to take care of them as much as he can. I do like how the story line is in this novel and the way the author wrote it. I think I would recommend this book to people that understand suspense novels. It could be a good book to people only if they understand it and the authors writing style.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Our family loves this movie.  The 3D effects are awesome!  And for science fiction it has a great story line.
B009IF82SK|5.0|This show is hysterical. Its one of the few I watch and am never disappointed with and frequently laugh out loud.
B002ZG97M4|5.0|This movie is filled with fun music, lots of humor, along with the angst of growing up in a small town.  Perfect for music loving teens.
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|My son asked for this CD.  He is a huge fan!  I am now a fan of hers as well!  Awesome music, well written and performed, she sounds great.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The scope of this book is incredible.  I really enjoyed 4HB, but found that the only apprehension I would have was the basics of the menu options (though they are comparable in diversity to most diet plans).  I mention this only to point out that Ferriss really came a long way (especially if you make it to the end of the book).  I enjoyed the cooking parts immensely, but was always more interested in his methodology, especially regarding linguistics.  This is the book for all of those things.  As recommended, I skipped over parts that were not specific to me (I'll just take the risks being out the in wild), but there was more than enough material keep me interested and experimenting on my own.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I mainly listen to my own .mp3s on my Fire but for those times when I want something different, this app does the trick for me.  It has enough selections in the categories that interest me to meet my needs.<br /><br />I have not experienced any issues with it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good book. I can not put it down.  I definitely recommend the book the Hunger Games.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Very cool battle scenes.  Actually good performance for something this far out there.  I have watched it 3 times and will continue to watch it again.
B004S82OAE|2.0|Lessons are great to bad they for got the CD that is suppose to acompany the literature, no way to download it and no way to contact Amazon to get a copy. Don't buy this for Kindle purshase that actual book so it is useful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a great and original story. I wish this was a series! I've  lost count on how many times I've read it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good story. Typical of Grisham, it picked up speed as it went along. So glad he still does his own writing and actually different plots with each book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its really fun and way more challenging than the original one its also more interesting the paths you run aren't just straight there scurvy and there's ropes and cart etc. just leave it at that really reconmend
B002ZG9774|5.0|awesome movie  Cher  plays  a grt part  and I love the song she did in it  and  Agilara is awesome also
0802473156|5.0|This book is good, and it can help with you and your spouse communication skills toward one another improve. Try reading it on your own, then with your spouse.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I liked this story from the childs point of view of &#34;His&#34; experience & how he was trying to deal with 9/11. I got it that he needed someting to make sense out of losing his Dad & he grasped on to something to keep him focused. A lot of people didn't get this but if you have ever been in an area where half the citizens have undergone a shock due to warfare or some other calamity and experienced their demeanor of total shock (it was called &#34;Shell-Shock&#34; in WWII) then you'll get what the movie was about. We don't all act the same when faced with a horrific thing that has happened to our senseabilities. A good movie.
160459201X|5.0|This book is an excellent read. If you want to know why things happen to you and you don't even realize how and where did it come from, this book will help you figure it out. you will learn how to keep your thoughts positive after reading this book.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|This could have ben a good movie had the &#34;Direction&#34; been a lot better. As it is I would rate it a &#34;B&#34; Movie. OK to buy it if you are a dyed in the wool Sci Fi Freak & any Sci Fi movie turns you on. For me it was disappointing.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I watched the movie i will admit because Bruce Willis was in it, and it did not disappoint me fast paced thriller with a concept twist that was refreshing.
B008P8B9ZY|5.0|I love my crocs, those shoe are more like clouds! I use in my week ends to relax my foots and get fresh.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This Hollywood types ought to try and come up with a fresh idea and if they have to remake a movie they have to go over the top , which with this floparoo they failed miserably. Total Fecal would be a much better title.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a very handy app to have on an Android phone or tablet. It is very easy to find files you may lose track of. This app also helps me to connect to my network drives without having to boot up the other computers.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very happy with this game. Good mix of HO, puzzles and adventure and could pick the level of difficulty that fits your style of game play. I like other similar games from this company. Definitely recommend. Just know that the free version is a demo and to get the full game you will have to pay for it (true of many games and the description does mention purchasing in game content (i.e the full version of the game)). I think the entire game/collector's edition was $2.99, not bad for this game and extra content. Will definitely be looking for similar games, as straight HO games are a little monotonous to me so the adventure, puzzles and mini-games included in this game was a perfect blend for me. The hint button and strategy guide can help when stuck, you can play dominoes instead of the HO scenes and you can skip any mini-games so it can be as challenging or as easy as you want it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Season 2 is just as good as Seaon 1! Lots of action and full of surprises! Season 2 doesn't disappoint.
B0053O89KG|5.0|i've been watching castle from the start. it has humor,sadness,love,honesty,etc. to me that's great writting ,directing and most importantly acting. i absolutely love this show.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Graphics are awesome, and the obstacle course is a lot of fun.  However, periodically during the game the screen freezes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its so AWESOME its advanced and WAYYYYYYY cooler B) than the 1Temple run dont get me wrong the 1ones ok but &quot;GET TEMPLE RUN 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
B008HK3XYK|1.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case that I received was too big for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;  and measured 5 3/4&#34; wide.  My Kindle Fires measure 4 1/2 &#34; wide.  I need to return the product. They were Xmas gifts for my grandaughters (2).  Very dissappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really awesome app and game, except it should be free, because there should be a DEMO version too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun game seems smooth play and a lot of fun even for adults.  time play game like a tycoon game so you have to wait for achievements.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|This was the first time i had read this book even though i have read most of Georgette Heyer's books many times.  As always a great story.  Nice young woman whose life have been rather plain - a rogue who falls in love with the young lady - opposition from some people - support from others.  Will they end up together -- duh!
1452110581|5.0|nice or maybe not to know what our feline friends are thinking... have bought for gifts for my cat loving friends,,,

B0013F1D02|5.0|This is a great movie with a fresh fairy tale that isn't an obvious rework of a fairy tale we already know.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Wonderful blend of voices, catchy beats and interesting lyrics. If you like Snow Patrol, Cold Play, etc. you'll like this CD.
0684824906|5.0|I can hardly fathom the colossal amounts of information processed by Goodwin. She is a meticulous researcher, but manages to convert all of it into a cohesive, entertaining read.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I have been watching this show since it came out and I have all the seasons so far and i can't wait for season 8 to come out so i can buy it to and i hope this show continues on. I think Derek Morgan is a hunk and very good looking.

B002ZXNZQG|5.0|I have read this book numerous times.  It is a must for anyone who enjoys reading and has a sense of humor.  Tragedy wrapped around this author is a story within its self.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I found it slow at times but there were some interesting twists to the story that kept me reading.  I thought I had figured out the secret but it kept me guessing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Loved this game the first day I played!!! You show, train, and care for your very own horse. I already can't get enough of this game.

B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie is about as close as I can get to a &#34;chick flick.&#34;  This movie is a true testament to Johnny Depp and Mary Stuart Masterson's acting abilities.
B004IK9SQ0|4.0|We in the Euro-American culture have been used to thinking of existence as separate boxes: you, me, animals, plants, inanimate objects, God, Satan, heaven, hell, etc.  Holmes, the founder of Centers for Spiritual Living (google it) was an American pioneer in bringing concepts of the oneness of all, including consciousness, to ordinary folks who have that separatist mindset.  Rather than the mainstream view of divinity as a bearded abusive white male father-figure up in the clouds who judges us to eternal reward or torment when we die, separate from us mortals down on the ground, Holmes stresses that there can be no divisions in reality, and that includes divinity.  Each person is a piece of God.  We therefore all have divine powers of creation, manifesting, healing, etc., if only we recognize and develop that in ourselves.<br /><br />Unfortunately for us, Holmes wrote in the mid 20th century, when a male-centric writing style was the norm, so he refers to everyone as &#34;man&#34;, &#34;he&#34;, etc., and uses the male pronoun for divinity.  It's clear from his writings that he really wasn't sexist; that was just the level of social consciousness then, hence how people spoke and wrote.  He also uses a very convoluted, complex writing style that was standard for educated people at the time, but hard for us to wade through now, regardless of our level of literacy.<br /><br />So, read the good stuff that he has to offer -- it's really worthwhile -- and translate in your head all the male terms into &#34;we&#34;, &#34;humanity&#34;, etc.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I really like this game.  Unfortunately, I have reached a level I can't seem to beat but I haven't given up<br />cool game

B00B2V66VS|2.0|Is anyone else having a hard time telling the difference between the path and the woods? Everything looks the same! I think the first one is better. There should be a tutorial for the cave part, I didn't know what I was supposed to do.

B008KMHFJY|5.0|Addictive read, couldn't put it down, hanging out for a second! Absolute great read and highly reccomend it to others.
0001939777|5.0|I was missing this edition of the set of books. It fit right in with the rest of them. Thanks
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty entertaining when you need to relax. the only thing was I had a hard time getting it started when I first installed it.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I am glad I waited to watch it.  This movie had me asking why Sylvester Stallone didn't get an Academy Award for his performance in the original.  ughhh
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good, he is not an arrogant man and just describes the day to day happenings. You can tell how much he cared for the men and women he was protecting, even if he did not know them.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is a sturdy enough case for the price. Offers protection and allows the kindle be angled in various positions for hands free viewing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game very challenging and is also very addictive but nothing free in this game you will see good creation and smart tactic.a game to get.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the book_the story real heart warming. Love all heart ache<br /><br />And the good times hope they make it together.
0307352145|5.0|Another great book for introverts. Sometimes its just nice to realize we aren't alone in our desire for quiet and that we aren't the only ones who are drained by interaction with others, even those we love.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I'm not a regular science fiction reader but started reading this book from a recommendation of the Sword and Laser book club. I wasn't disappointed. This is a seriously good read. I guess it's a matter of personal taste but I really enjoyed how Old Man's War was written and how it didn't get bogged down in too much descriptive sections of the science behind absolutely everything that was going on. There's description and explanation there but it doesn't overtake the story.<br /><br />I think Scalzi does a great job of finding a blance between the science fiction elements of the story and the overall development of the story and its characters. Overall, this was simply a really enjoyable read, and one that leaves you wanting to know more about the universe Scalzi has created here. I've already purchased the Ghost Brigades and can't wait to read it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|One of literature's all-time greats.  Victor Hugo masterfully weaves his tapestry of characters like a symphony with a grand crescendo at the end.  The plot is full of twists & turns and the characters are complex.
034580404X|5.0|I found violence too much to read but at the same time I couldn't stop reading because I wantwd to know what happened next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this g&aacute;me! the only problem I had was that it didn't open once but then it started to work. so much fun!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I bought this app and started playing it immediately. I was playing it for so long that my mom grounded me from playing it...lol.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Wow this album is so awesome! If you have an open mind for music with a fresh sound this is an album for you! Listen to it all the way through 3-5 times and I will guarantee you will enjoy this amazingly unique piece of art!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It does everything I wanted. Makes reading in bed easier, easier to hold, lighted page makes it easier to see in bad lighted places.  It protects my Kindle and easy to take places. Which I take my Kindle every where. It props up just right.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works great on the Kindle. All the features that you expect and the response time is quick. Works great. Get it, you will like it,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got it but so far its good n n n n n nm n n n n n n n n n n
B00164KYV4|4.0|I generally find that the ensemble movies with their multiple story lines that are supposed to be somehow related generally just leave me dissatisfied, however this one clicked, touched a nerve, whatever--I enjoyed the overall story line, and I enjoyed the characters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is so fun riding on ziplines and mine carts it is like the coolest game I wouldn't wait to ask a friend i got it to have fun
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Although I can not see someone in their twenties caring about this movie, for those of us of a more mature perspective, this movie was a treat.  The acting was as you’d expect from such veterans, the story line was heartfelt and the setting was vibrant.  This was one of my top movies of 2012.  On repeat viewing, the movie held up as a great evening’s entertainment.
B008M36EEI|4.0|While the title would leave you to believe that this is a fish tale...it's truly a well written touching love story.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The quality of season one has been continued in season two.  I still enjoy the characters and story lines.  This is simply a great way to spend an evening.
0345803485|1.0|A relative mentioned it was \\"famous\\", so I borrowed it from the library and am grateful I didn't waste the money to buy it. I read about 1/3 of it, waiting for something to pique my interest.  I quit, don't care how it ends.  There are three of these books?  Gees......  I'm no prude, but this is simply a script for a very very very long corny porn movie in book form, lousy acting, no real story.  The writing is bad.  The characters, Ana and Christian are juvenile and phony with no depth of personality.  I couldn't find anything to respect or like about either one.  The repetitive lip biting, yes sir's, porn scenes etc are overdone.  The sex scenes, since I can't even begin to identify with the characters, are just plain yada yada.  How much of it can one read before its ho hum. Who has any desire to know how a foolish wuss physically felt in an S/M relationship being used like a piece of meat.  Little inkling of a plot beyond the story of a naive, immature and not very intelligent college grad and a handsome rich guy who is oversexed with kinky needs and power and control issues.  Ana is just another Stephanie Plum who has a lot of sex.  But Stephanie is funny and is likeable, Ana isn't.  Maybe Christian ends up loving her since it goes on and on for three books I assume, but, so what.  Its just dumb.  Sad that this is what the media is putting out for young people, examples of a relationship started on and based solely on using one another physically!  Neither character is a role model for either gender. No thanks.  This is not literature, or even entertaining.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Fans of Cranford, Downton Abbey, and Gosford Park (some of the works of Julian Fellowes) will like this as well.  The overlapping story lines between the time periods and visual movement from one time period to the next are done with such skill the viewer has no trouble knowing where they stand.  The acting is splendid but then we have Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall and Hugh Bonneville just to mention a few.  And I will admit that I have become a fan of Alex Etel.  That was an amazing job especially given the number of scenes he was in.
B0012FHGCW|1.0|A young man with a brilliant future ahead of him chooses to throw it all away.  Ignoring the warnings and advice of everyone, he decides to go into the wilds of Alaska without even the most basic of survival skills or equipment, he didn't even have a compass.  He brought a .22 LR rifle to use to hunt, totally inappropriate for Alaska.  Oh and he had no real hunting experience.  When he decided he really didn't like starving to death he decided to walk out, not having bothered to learn that a.) the river depth varied by season and b.) there was a tram that would have gotten him across the river only a 1/4 mile from where he failed to cross it.  Sure do miss that ability to read a map, and a compass to use with it now don't you?<br /><br />I think this says it best:<br />Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote:<br />  \\"When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn't even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament [... ] Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.\\"
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I haven't actually used it yet, but I have looked at it.  It seems easy to navigate, and easy to figure out how to use and set it properly.  It is a good basic alarm clock app, one that I will find adequately useful in the future.
0525953590|4.0|The book is well written, with lots of historical information, as well as information about the LHC.  The meaning of the Higgs is clarified, and ideas of future discoveries that may occur.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It's OK.  Predictable, unlikely, and the constant trust issue between the two of them was way too drug out.  Both characters has insecurity issues, that I grew tired of their not resolving them in a more open communication way.  This story should have ended much sooner, which I think the book would have mad the book better.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I had already seen the movie and was surprised by the story, so very similar to my own childhood. I got to read the book now and it's better than the movie. Real joy and great inspiration.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|Good work out video for pre-natal.  I am only in my 1st trimester and if I am still doing it like Erin OBrien is in her 7th mo, I will be impressed.  A little low budget on the filming style, but serves the purpose of an inexpensive, decent workout that you feel comfortable doing while you are pregnant.
B0095R64AO|2.0|This movie started off funny and then d r a g g e d. I didn't even finish it! Pass.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|Great teens move ever :) and lots of my friends almost own all of them.<br />when my friends come over we watch them on DVD.<br />I love it!

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is amazing. you know a game is good when people make copies of it.<br /> A must have. played it for hours
159114325X|4.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know more about German Capital Ships. It has a lot of interesting pictures that heretofor have not been seen and lots of great information.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I kept hearing about Downton Abbey, and when I got Amazon Prime, I ordered it for my Kindle for free! The acting is superb, and the story is so intriguing! Also, I love learning about that time in history!
B00422LESO|4.0|I like Austen, a lot.  I've read all her novels (including the non finished ones).  I've seen a lot of Austen films, and have read some Austen related books.  I mention this because the main character has an obsession of Austen and Mr. Darcy.  Shannon Hale is more known for her young adult fiction fantasy, but Austenland is adult fiction.<br /><br />This book is a modern ADULT British Chick book.  This is geared more for adults and for people who are familiar with Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E Miniseries)]].<br /><br />It has a typical 32 year old single woman with high expectations of her Mr. Right.  Although in Jane's case, it's Mr. Darcy.  Her English attitude and accent was off putting at times, as well as Jane's childish inner thoughts.  Shannon went too far in making Jane insecure.  I did like some of the humor and even laughed a little.<br /><br />The premise of the retreat and Regency era role playing is both original and comedic.  The details of Pembrook Park is delicious to where I imagined myself there.  This storyline and romance is why I have and will continue to reread this.<br /><br />I got this ebook for $2 and I also have the paperback [[ASIN:1596912863 Austenland: A Novel]]<br /><br />And I'm very interested in seeing how this will look in the upcoming movie.
0307744434|2.0|It took me forever to get through this book. While the author uses beautiful descriptive imagery, the characters are dissapointing. The story feels like it never gets off the ground until very late in the book and then ends in a rather unsatisfying conclusion. Pretty much a waste of my time.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman movies, this movie is funny and enjoyable to watch.  I liked the RED characters working together after retirement.  I would recommend to anyone that likes a laught or two.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does everything you need and easy to understand. Buttons are clear and visible and the install was simple and fast
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great Actors and Great Writing always mean a most enjoyable show especially when you have<br />no idea what is going to happen next.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The story gives a special meaning to the sacrifices our people in uniform make for us. Well written, it details the extent these men will go to for each other and their country.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Considering this movie is packed with some of the worst actors, it was actually entertaining! Loved the action scenes, pretty violent, but every time they talked it just became hilarious. Worth my 3.99 rent.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I only wish I could have full use of the site, i.e. I haven't found how to edit previous pins. Other than that, it is a great little version of Pinterest!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Loved this DVD set. The concert is wonderful. Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves it as well.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like the music, not too overwhelming. Great problem solving with an adult presentation. The menus are easy to navigate.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I have not received this CD yet, but since it was recorded in his later years, I just know I will love it.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|If you watched the Thor, Captain america and Iron Man movies, this brought them all together.  Joss Whedon did an excellent job of keeping the characters (some, originally directed by others) consistent with what they were in the individual movies.  A very satisfying ending.  Lots of humor to keep it light when necessary.
B002KREVE2|1.0|I absolutely love Leonard Cohen, but only his recordings in his later years.  Through time his voice has taken on a deep rhaspy, whiskey voice that adds so much more depth to it.  His early recordings have great credence, but it is his later recordings that have drawn me in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game rocz!!! it is really fun and addicting (in a good way). did I tell you this game rocks??!!!??!? well it does bye!!
B00633W614|5.0|Learning about the Cliftons and the Barringtons spins a tale of romance, intrigue, friendship and evil. Wonderful characters…on to book two!!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|After reading review after review, I was worried even though I was purchasing the Original UK Version that I might be ordering 'cut/shorter' versions of the show. Very happy this set contained the full season 1 and 2 episodes AND Christmas special as well as additonal bonus material.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The challenge system is a nice welcome, but they get too hard way too fast. Jetpack Joyride has the perfect mix of challenges. rambling up difficulty as you level up. I'm at level 7 now, and can't complete the challenges given to me to move on.<br />I know there are those that have no problems getting past these challenges, but since this is my opinion and review, I give it three stars, because I can't move forward.
B004HYDM0A|5.0|This documentary is the story of Nev and the family he met through Facebook. He begins to have feelings for Megan, but things soon begin to not make sense. If you have ever seen the show Catfish on MTV then you will know who Nev is. It was a great documentary that had me laughing at some points and shocked by the end. I loved getting to know Nev's story and makes me love the show Catfish that much more because Nev understands what the people on the show are going through.
B001OKGV6W|4.0|This was a purchase for my granddaughter for her science class.  She loved it.  This will be in her library.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|this is perfect in terms of size and performance. i have mine with an 1k 3750k, 8 gb of ram, 2 TB of hard along with a 128gb ssd. since i use mine for normal stuff (no gaming), it runs quite smooth. will be buying more in the future for business use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It has different obstacles, like a railroad cart, and zip line like stuff. It's very fun, and I love the new style compared to the first one. I love it, and recommend it if you liked the first!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Perfect product. Strong magnet to connect MagSafe 1 to MagSafe 2. Only thing is this piece is difficult to find. I accidentally dropped a converter between some slats and couldn't find it anymore. I recommend you secure this adapter with a piece of tape.
B0013YPEMG|4.0|CLASSIC!<br />First Batman film, hallmark of the 80s and 90s.<br />Well done, incredible Elfman score, Joker's a bit cheesy, but Nicholson is still...Nicholson.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I'm no expert, but this book seems very well written (not surprisingly). I find these types of biographies and autobiographies fascinating because, as a baby boomer, you realize that the kids caught up in the explosion of rock and roll in the 60's and early 70's were just a bunch of immature kids caught up in the moment, not all that different from the rest of us. The relationships between members of the various bands, how they would support and play with one another....a really nice insight into the times in which we grew up. And in Pete's case, it is fascinating to read about the personal pain and turmoil as well as the creative process. I've read a few of these types of books now and Pete's is as good as any......
B004EPZ070|4.0|I am a complete pushover when it comes to romantic comedy novels-turned movies.  I can't NOT watch them.<br />Ginnifer Goodwin is annoying in the film and self-depracating to the point of excess, but everyone's attractive and Jim Halpert steals the show.
B004HD61KE|5.0|He did it again! Another page turner, couldn't put it done when I had to couldn't wait to pick it back up! Excellent read!
B001X0ZKM4|3.0|If its possible to say this - its almost TOO Tim Burton-y.<br />Its overly dark and even though its in the vein of the first Batman, its just too much.<br />Love Pfeiffer.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|If you're a Science of Mind follower this is the book to have.  Love the Kindle edition. Can't go wrong if you need a pick me up, by reading any portion of this book.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Some episodes were a little blurry via Amazon, but all in all a great series.<br />Sometimes violent, but incredibly well-acted.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|With a  neuro surgeon as the author, I was expecting more of a scientific approach. I was surprised instead at just how human and ordinary the story is . very descriptive for NDE.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a while.  Thread of stories that overlap by the end.  Honest, lovely characters that all face pregnancy in different ways.  Heartbreaking, hilarious, and enjoyable.  Definitely worth it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A very insightful look into what a dog thinks (maybe).  It reads well and I was sad to have finished it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Stupidest crap movie ever.  Theron and Helmsworth are attractive and fantastic.<br />Kristen Stewart barely says two words and theres this whole scene with a stag in the forest that speaks to Snow White's purity and how she's going to bring about the downfall of the evil queen.  Its just stupid.<br />Best scene is the huntsman kissing her back to life - his speech is heartbreaking.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|The Verso Proloque Case for the Kindle Fire and other 7\\" tablets gives the look of a leather bond antique book or journal.  The gold foiled stamping and embossed embellishments (raised images) give it a look of class and elegance.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire does fit snugly in the elastic straps, but just about entirely cover the speakers at the top which does affect the sound. This seemed to be a serious design flaw unless the user only uses the Kindle to read or uses ear buds exclusively.<br /><br />The cover also does not stay completely closed.  I highly recommend using a screen protector and being very careful when transporting the Kindle Fire in a briefcase or purse since something can easily get in between the case's cover and touch screen and easily scratch the screen. I would of been great if it came with some kind of elastic band or magnetic tab to keep it closed.<br /><br />Even though I have some negative comments, this is a beautiful case.  It would make a great gift for someone who uses their Kindle Fire mostly at home instead of taking it with them everywhere.  If you are looking for a case to travel with, I recommend one that has some kind of magnetic tab or elastic strap to keep it shut.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of films with multiple plot lines and stories.<br />All were well acted, but its not entirely satisfying.<br />Definitely a few honest and cute moments that make it worth seeing.
B008MF3OEY|3.0|I switched to the Verso Prologue cover for the Kindle Fire after using a Marware Cover.<br /><br />The Verso Prolouge  cover is very nicely crafted and has the appearance and feel of a well bound classic book that would be of gift level quality. The elastic straps that hold the Kindle in place are firm, but just about entirely cover the speakers at the top which does affect the sound. This seemed to be a serious design flaw unless the user only uses the Kindle to read or uses ear buds exclusively.<br /><br />The micro fleece inside the front flap is a nice protection for the glass surface, and the pocket is good for document portability or notes.<br /><br />This could be a nice cover to use for Book Club meetings or hanging out in the bistro, but for basic use and protection, I would probably change back to the Marware and it's construction to allow unblocked speakers.
B0026145WK|4.0|Liam Neeson - case and point.<br />He is pretty much the only reason to watch this action movie.  Its fantastic though, because its so realistic.<br />LOVE it.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. Jonathan and Charlotte complement each other perfectly. The Prayer is truly moving and one of the best performances I have heard in a long time.
B000JD1CBY|5.0|I am enamored of period pieces and this one is well done.<br />All the actresses are charming and honest.<br />Confronts the idea of feminism and the idea of family life and expectations in the 50s.<br />LOVE IT!
0345803507|5.0|This is a very entertaining trilogy.  It kept my interest and was a pleasure to read.  The third book was a little slow and took a bit longer to finish.  But all in all..................it's HOT!
1609611543|5.0|I was recommended this by my doctor as a suggestion for my ongoing upset stomach and migraine headaches. When I read it, I found out so many things about wheat and similar foods as well as the cause of my symptoms. A great read!
B0058RN85O|5.0|Season two is even better than the first one! My family and I love this show. It's so worth watching.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I rated it with 4 stars because it was a good movie that kept my attention.  I was confused for a bit about the story line but still a good movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am completely drawn in with this PBS series.  What an accurate look back in time to see how both sides lived.  Very entertaining!
0547581033|1.0|It is a boring book with every page reading the same line..over and over and over until the end.... I do not recommend spend money on this book. It is a total waste of money.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Just yesterday when I was babysitting my grandkids, I downloaded this game, believe it or not, for my 3 year-old.  He played with it for almost an hour!  Whenever he'd get stuck, he'd give it to me and I even had a challenge on some of the levels.  It's really fun!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun but you cant get a lot of money but you can get a lot of gems and your horse is always in a bad mood
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 6 year-old grandson begged me to download this game into my kindle fire but I think I'm enjoying it more than he is.  When he comes over, his first words are, &#34;Can I play Angry Birds Star Wars?&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great Game! I loved the first one so I definetly had to download this one and its awesome! Just as much fun as the first Temple Run. The difficulty is stepped up in this one which makes it even more fun. Download this and you wont be sorry.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Next to Angry Birds Star Wars, this came has my grandson absolutely mezmerized.  He not only loves to play it, he insists I sit and watch him play it.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|download was without a hitch, however would not boot up to play no matter how many times i deleted and downloaded it. iphone 4 app.
B000LPS4BQ|5.0|Love the movie! Cute humor with some hidden jokes that only older people would understand.<br />Can't beat a Blu-ray at the price I got it either.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|You cant beat this movie! Its a great Dr. Suess Movie - that my son loves!<br />It is perfect for the whole family!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is not terrible but I honestly like the first temple run better. Sure this has better graphics but it's just not the same. It is fun to play though just not five star material.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|This was such a great show for adults and kids to watch together.  Real family fun for all ages.  Thanks
0316227706|5.0|love it love it  i show this book to everyone, my mother said she wants one, so does my god daughter
B0013TTLDE|4.0|The House At Riverton deals with the ups and mainly downs of a British aristocratic family starting in 1914.  The narrator of the story is a house maid telling the tale in flashbacks during the 1990s at an extremely old age in a retirement center.  The author must have paid extra attention to flashbacks in creative writing class as that is her strongest writing skill, in addition of course to maintaining suspense to keep you going to the end, and the real ability to make you feel that you are actually in the scene she is describing.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, it appears that the author did an enormous amount of research about the time period, and during the beginning of the book starting shortly before World War 1, I was surprised at the feudalistic nature of British society.  There were the aristocrats who owned the land and the huge house, then everyone else either had the function of waiting on them hand and foot or living in the village hanging on every detail of the aristocrats'lives.  The lengths to which the narrator goes in her servility are downright shocking, and frankly stupid by today's standards.  The book also conveys in a very real way the highly constrained circumstances of women of both the lower and upper classes during the time period of the book, and is a textbook reason for the advent of and need for feminism and truly equal rights for women.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a \\"feel good\\" experience, even though the author tries to end on a positive note.  However, for anyone who wants the feeling of experiencing first hand England both from the viewpoint of the enslaved and enslavers, during a time of change that primarily covers the period of 1914 to the middle of the Roaring Twenties, I would highly recommend the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's perfect for any type of horse lover out there.  It's definitely worth giving it a try!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|but then again nicholas sparks always makes me cry.... i loved the book and actually even liked the movie tho i didnt think they were very much alike...
B0011Z9360|4.0|It's Zeppelin, so it's still decent, but not my favorite songs. You have to own it and listen to it a few times to appreciate the talent, but if you bought this album first, don't judge them on it. Buy a few others and you'll be happy you did!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was a great way to improve on an already very good and addicting game. The graphics are very nice and the controls are well done.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is good for around an 8 yr old my lol girl is 5 and is finding it a little hard with the concept of feeding etv but still enjoys it none the less.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put it down. Fantastic series full of suspense and sadness mixed with danger and hope. Must read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved the flow and descriptive nature of the narrative.  Beautiful book that gives one much to think and contemplate about.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|Set immediately prior, during and just after WW1 (as well as modern day) this is a lovely story which looks at the era of class divisions in the UK.  While one strand of the tale is a love story and a tragedy, it is told through the eyes of a very ancient Lady's Maid who's reflections on her early working life also weaves her story.
1401322786|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it.  She has always enjoyed Mitch Albom books, and from what she tells me, he's a great writer.  I haven't personally read any of his books (I'm not a big reader), but she absolutely loves them all.  So if you're a fan of Mitch Albom, &#34;The Time Keeper&#34; is probably a good addition to the collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My son is fascinated by the history of WWII and the fact that Dick Winters is from our hometown, makes this movie exceptionally interesting to him.
B000HL09SA|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since it came out!! I would advise families to watch this movie for it is awesome!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|PCs don't play music well without an external DAC. This portable unit does the job really well for the price, and it can also be used with portable MP3 players.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|Very well written and I was very pleased with it the book was not choppy and it had an amazing ending[which a twist ]
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Makes any Mp3 player sound better, and with a Sony, Sandisk or Ipad player and the special line out cables from Fiio, it sounds fantasic.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|This was suppose to be a \\"New\\" product. When I received it it was opened. There was no plastic wrap, and even the safety seal was taken off. When I read the invoice it stated \\"kept like new.\\" Totally different then when you're ordering something that you expect to actually be \\"brand new.\\" There were even finger prints on the disc. Very disappointed.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|DAC for the PC combined with MP3 player amplifier with 2 headphone ports. In this price range, nothing beats this unit.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Super glitchy. Really fun concept. Its too hard to get gems and it takes gems to buy new horses. That's really bad in my book.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|A must have device for any avid computer gamer. If your into MMO's you will be amazed at what this device does for your gameplay. Instead of looking down at your selections you can view the game and enjoy it more.
B007PFD90G|4.0|Well, it's a great book, but could be a little shorter. Sometimes gets a little repetitive. Salman has, though a great sense of humor, even going through the hell he's been.<br />I'm from South America and not too literate, so about 75 % of the names of authors he cites, are unknown to me, which is a bit frustrating .... globalization is a fact. But I do recommend. You can live his adventure, or his private/familiar hell through his pages.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I wouldn't have wasted my money if I had known. Not a movie I would have thought Mathew would take part in.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought this was a nice fun movie for the family. If you like Glee you'll like this. Would have liked it more, it seemed to have gaps in the storyline.  But nothing to stop you from enjoying the story ans the music.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|If you liked Clint in Gran Torino, you will like this movie. Amy Adams is also very good & easy on the eyes.
B0088WK27S|3.0|Good movie, some slow parts but excellent story. I like that this is based on a true story. Would have liked more about the kids but then again that is not what the movie is about.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've only played this game for a short time but it is very addictive and fun to play. plus free is always good
B005LAII8K|2.0|WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br /><br />In some ways, \\"Looper\\" is a good movie. It attempts a unique premise on sci-fi, with very little emphasis on CGI and special effects (they are there in limited capacity, and performed convincingly). The acting is generally quite good, particularly what is offered by the protagonist. The plot was intriguing at first, but eventually fell apart by having major holes that destroyed the suspension of disbelief, in addition to undoing the earlier established \\"rules\\" of this particular fiction. The opening twenty minutes or so of the movie are riveting... but then things start to go south.<br /><br />Although the efforts at creating a bleak 2044 Kansas are partially successfull, it's pretty jarring when everybody's driving around in current gen Ford F-150s and Chevy Silverados. And why are the \\"gat men\\" waltzing around with antiquated six shooters, when there are fully automatic assault rifles RIGHT NEXT to them, just waiting for their enemy to pick up (which he does, of course, before going on a cartoon-like killing spree that defies the otherwise somber tone of the movie). The murder of Old Joe's wife in the future completely unravels the earlier established premise that the mob is unable to kill in their own time, thereby ruining the entire concept of the film, and making every action of every character nonsensical and without consequence.<br /><br />Furthermore, the rules of time travel are changed from scene to scene, for whatever needs the writer/director needs, until it becomes a bird's nest of paradoxes that don't hold up under even mild scrutiny. The director makes a weak attempt to gloss things over by having a couple of characters suggest, \\"try not to think about the complications of time travel\\", and Willis even pounds a table in anger at one point, repeating \\"It [the rules/logic of our time travel] don't matter!\\", as if shouting like an enraged toddler will nullify the gaping holes that have been poked in the film's logic. I'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief, and I rarely complain about things in fiction being \\"unrealistic\\", but these trespasses were too glaring to ignore, and they tarnish the experience.<br /><br />What upsets me most about this movie, however, is that the movie has a character (played by Willis, no less), who goes about murdering defenseless children (granted, he only got one, but he planned on three) for reasons that are completely selfish and irredeemable. Really? You're going to murder three little kids, just so you can have a few more years with your wife? Old Joe goes on to explain that he loves his wife because she is so compassionate and nurturing... and yet he's completely comfortable with committing his own dark deeds for the sake of spending more time with her, thereby undoing any and all good she may have achieved in her life.<br /><br />Yes, I understand that he is a \\"villain\\" of sorts in the movie (though the director clearly wants us to empathize with him, given all the time spent on flashbacks of his time with his wife), and I understand that the character is separate from the human being who is portraying him on screen, but there are certain things that are taboo, even in our society... and the murder of children is one such thing (particularly in this post-Newtown, post-Aurora world). That is not entertainment, it's cheap shock tactics. What's really disappointing is that this scene could have been EASILY avoided altogether... the character could have been abducted by the gat men on his first attempt, rather than his second, or he could have spent all his time trying to track down the true \\"Rain Maker\\", had that memory been bestowed upon him just a few hours earlier.<br /><br />I like Bruce Willis and enjoy his work, but \\"Looper\\" is a black eye on his career.film's logic.

B0058YPL66|5.0|But when I saw the first episode, I cant stop watch the series. I really like it and I recommend.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Thank heaven my daughter loves this movie instead of one that might drive me nuts.  The spaghetti western style mixed with the colorful characters and interesting choices of the creators/actors/director all add up to a fun and visually stunning story telling event.  My daughter is 2 and this is the movie she's hooked on.  We decided to download it onto our Kindle so we can travel with the movie - a GREAT choice!  I've suggested this movie for friends who want to watch something lite, but entertaining.  It will make you laugh out loud!  Enjoy!
B004VB3UYW|5.0|I'm reading R the way I would start learning to cook: by reading recipes and trying them out.<br /><br />The book is well-organized, with lots of examples, discussion about common pitfalls, etc.<br /><br />I bought the DRM-free PDF from O'Reilly as well, which allows me to annotate the file and have it available everywhere I am using Dropbox.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Wonderful, fast paced  relevant to todays world......Clancy is a master at what he does..........Threat Vector great great read.........trust me you will love it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Zombie movies or books, but on the advice of a close friend I read World War Z.  It is so well written that I could not put the book down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I got this book because it really sounded good and it was on the best seller list. It was an awesome book, but the ending was horrible. Seriously, they couldnt think of anything else?
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Absolutely loved the movie but love to sing along to all of the amazing songs! A must buy for everyone!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|VERY NICE SLEEVE. EXACTLY AS ADVERTRIZED. GREAT PRICE. FREE SHIPPING. THE KINDLE FIRE SHOULD BE COVERED WHILE CARRYING IT AROUND OR EVEN STORING IT. THE KISS PRINCIPLE APPLIES HERE AND THIS PRODUCT WORKS !
B009JCL58G|5.0|Epic Soundtrack...for an Epic Movie. This soundtrack is so dramatic and fitting for the film and it really brings you back to some of the most memorable moments. LOVE IT!
030758836X|4.0|I like the way the book was set up so that you did not get tired of just hearing one side of the story.  It made you second guess your feeling for the husband and then again for the wife.  Worth reading
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First off, Sit Down to play this. Unlike first Temple Run, which was all right angles &amp; all mostly level, this game rolls up &amp; down hills, staircases, sweeps thru curves, etc. Try to play standing at a bus stop or something, you *will*  meet people -- when you lose balance &amp; fall into them. It's that engrossing.<br />  Graphics are rich &amp; detailed, all manner of new obstacles -- &quot;Really??  Wheels with spikes??&quot;  The collectible gems to Save &amp; continue are a great addition.The real fun begins once you go underground in the Mine Carts, or reach the Land of Many Ziplines -- but to get to either, you have to first cross those nasty crumbling half-bridges.<br />  Great App -- Get it!!  And Good Luck
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of the better free games I have found. The Help section is very good, it gives all the info needed on how to play and what tiles and buttons do what. It seem to have all the functionality of some of the Mahjong games you pay for and it doesn't shove the 'buy the full version' ad in your face all the time.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It's an interesting concept with some good actors. I thought it was let down by a lack of depth in the characters and a number of holes in the plot devices.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|What at first looks like another anoying singing/teen flick quickly redeems itself with a great cast and quick and constant punchlines. Rebel Wilson is the true star of this flick in an unforgetable and seriously hilarious role. Definately a new fave up with mean girls.
B007U8UBGI|3.0|I like Jack White, bit this album is very similar to his White Stripes work. I'd hoped for some newer sounds.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the new features.  the ropes and the gold mine ...this is a good game....<br />I like this game and enjoy it.<br />but I wish there weed more cheap.characters...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved this game so much I am addicted to it. My high score is over1,000,000 .I never thought that
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is my favorite show. If you like training, this show will motivate you to train harder just like a gladiator.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|it is a very good knife. I would refer it to my friends. handles great, also, a good price. !!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Having seen all 3 seasons and Reading the entire Comic book, i can say with confidence that Season 3 is the best season yet.  So if you liked the first 2 seasons, get ready to enjoy the best season yet.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A very down to earth story . I felt that I was there with them . A story about ordinary men and women doing a hell of a job.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is an okay time waster game. Could be better if higher levels it was easier to get other room items.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really fun game. My boys and I love it. More characters easier to use. A lot of upgrades to choose from
B00136JS12|5.0|Love the sound of their first album. It was so fresh and new at the time. As they moved forward the sound became to homogenized in the sound studio and the freshness of the sound faded a bit.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book!!! Going to read it over and over. Adult book only!!! I couldn't put it down!! I love all of the fifty shades of grey. But this one was the best out of the three.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A bit more lovey dovey than i like my fantasy but a good read none the less.  definitely been sucked into a few sections.
B0063IH60K|4.0|For passing the time this is a good game to play. Easy to follow format. Sometimes easy, sometimes challenging. Enjoy.
0756665949|5.0|Me and my fiance are huge LOST fans and are really glad we got this!  Everything about this is really great, definitely something Losties should invest in.
B001RUXW48|5.0|Good movie - seemed pretty realistic. The stream was good, however I wish all the movies had closed captions... the actors with accents are hard to understand.
6303983812|5.0|This VHS tape came in my mail perfectly, the movie came brand new and i was really excited! I would totally recommend this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's so fun and better than the first one. My high score is 3 million already it's kinda easy and hard but ADDICTING! I like the graphics and everything but what is that BIG BEAST? Is it an ape with a skull head and snake tongue? But just it's awesome!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great book lots of detail<br />Good<br />Breaking dawn is epic<br />Best book ever!!!!!!!cool<br />Cool breath taking and epic I love twilight!!!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|You have to get this app. It is amazing! Though Mojang needs to update just a little bit. It has every ore and all the tools. The app has about 500 items!!! Best app for Kindle fire!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am 11, and I was just looking for a decent horse or animal game and so far this is the best.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's thoroughly awesome :) lots of fun and a great sequel. You can ride in a monetary, collect, gems, and there's new powerhouse. It was challenging at first but once you get the hang of it you'll know you love it. Plus, it's free. Definitely sweet!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it was very well written in a style that I love...descriptive and action packed. I had a hard time putting it down. Can't wait to start book two. Should finish in about three days. (Have to go to work.)
B008DL466C|5.0|This was a gift, and the person that i gave it say &#34; He is an exellent artist and i love his music&#34;
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this was a fun game to play I enjoyed it but the gems were hard to get sometimes and align takes awhile to get a descent dragon which made me impatient
B003K16P3M|5.0|The writing in this book is beautiful! It is an exciting read! Love the characters!<br />Katsa is a heroin you don't normally see in novels! She is invincible! No damsel in distress in this book!<br />There is a lot of action! Lots of unexpected plot turns! And this is an extremely Original story!<br />A good read:)
0345529057|4.0|I can't personally say that this series is great, as I had the set delivered to my daughter's house. She started reading the first book and is enthralled with it!  I'm sure I'll enjoy them as much as she does when I finally get them.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Awesome book, well written. But i did find that it dragged on abit at the end. I would have also liked to know what happened to sky when six came back from her hoilday. But overall was a good read :)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Well, OK, I'll say a little more.  It's refreshing when you get stories that are original, or at least are not very common, and I've never heard of this one before.  Like all Pixar movies it's on-screen beauty and production value are beyond expectations, and it has a decent teaching moral to the story.  It really is a classic you can watch again and again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so significant! I think its actually better than the first one. Everyone should get this app! Very cool!
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Like all the resident evils you get lots of action, flashy special effects, mutated zombies, and Millia Jovovich in all her nearly naked and tight suit wearing splendor.  It won't win an academy award but if you are in the mood for sci-fi action...
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun game to play and very entertaining to me I win some and I lose some lol that's the way the cookie crumbles as they say hehe..
B000JMLFLW|5.0|i love Jane Austen, and this is just the perfect romance, i keep re-reading it to cheer me up when i'm blu
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This was another gift but always a good classic movie to watch.. I like fantasy movies as well as action adventure so tis is a good movie 2 own.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|What a great game...kudos to the developers!  My kids ages 5 and 7 love it and so do i. We enjoy creating the stickman and changing it from time to time. It doesmake you think so kids may need some help.
B001E75QGG|5.0|I have the dvd version of this movie and it's awesome lots of action with the older and younger version hehe of Indy being father and son.. Everyone in the movie did a great job :)
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This app reminds me of Cut The Rope, just in the sense that there's a cute main character, and you have to try and steer him toward a specific target, and gravity + strategy are involved.  In Cut The Rope, you had to get the candy to the monster, while in Rescue Roby, you have to get him into his crate, so he can escape the evil factory that rejected him for being different from all the rest of the assembly line robots.  (Being a misfit outcast myself, I like the moral to the story right there.)<br /><br />It kinda has a 'push the crate' feel to it too, in that, you gotta figure out the maze. To free Roby, you have to smash crates and platforms in the right sequence to get Roby to drop, roll or bounce into his crate.  Some crates can't be smashed, and must be used as supports or blocks to help guide things in the right direction.  So it's quite challenging, yet not too complicated.  If I'm ever not sure what to do, I just experiment with different sequences and just the simple repetition of trial and error.  You gotta get the physics working right to collect all the sprockets in each level, and get Roby into his crate.<br /><br />As levels progress, Roby finds some friends along the way -- Level 2 has a military Roby, and you have to get them both into their respective crates, while still collecting all 3 sprockets.  Collecting sprockets in this game is the same as collecting 'stars' in other games.<br /><br />There's even a level where you have to help Roby hook-up with his girlfriend, so to speak.  Basically, you just have to get them close enough to share a kiss; no getting them into a crate on that level; at that point, they're too preoccupied with each other to want to escape the factory. ;o)<br /><br />The graphics are colorful and smooth.  The physics are good.  The sound fx are cute.  The music doesn't get annoying over time.  The programming is polished and professional.  Doesn't hang or take forever to load.  And most importantly, it's fun and challenging.  This is a great time waster and brainteaser.  It's just good, clean, goofy fun.  Good for all ages; nothing violent for kids, yet quirky and irreverent enough for adults.  Overall, a really great game.  We got it on G-play.  This deserves to be a FAOTD here on 'the Zon,' as Fallon would say.<br /><br />Hang on Roby -- I'm coming to rescue you!<br />Happy! ;oDThis is a great time waster and brainteaser.

B000RPCK1U|5.0|I think Pierce Brosnan is a very good James Bond.  &#34;Bond, James Bond&#34;.  I also liked Terry Hatcher, although she had a very small part and was absolutely crazy about Michele Yeoh.  The rest of the cast was excellent, like Judy Dench &#34;Judy Judy Judy&#34; .  Jonathan Pryce is a good actor, but not my cup of tea.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I'm not telling you anything at all.  You just have to see it.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. Period.
0062127241|5.0|I loved this book.  Townsend tells it all from his perspective, warts and all.  He is a bit of mess personally, especially at some periods in his life, and that comes through.  However, he appears to have kept a journal throughout his career, so the recollections of what happened at a particular time are very clear and, one would assume, quite accurate.  The book is very orderly and gives some pretty decent insights into Pete, the Who, the Songs, etc. This makes for great reading. For a music lover like me who wants and needs to know everything about, behind and around the artists who make that music, this is definitely one of the best autobiographies from the rock world.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|THis is Adele's first album.  I really love her music and such talent to be able to sing many times with no accompaniment is amazing.  This album will not disappoint.
B002GJU54E|4.0|In her 18th novel in the Stephanie Plum series and fourth in-between-the numbers novel, \\"Plum Spooky,\\" Janet Evanovich takes her heroine, Stephanie Plum, into the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Not only to face the mud, townies, and the Jersey Devil, but also to stop a psychotic murderer from killing his next victim and to bring in her failure to appear (FTA).<br /><br />Plum is a bounty hunter who lives in Trenton, N.J., and works for her cousin Vinnie at the bail bonds office. Plum Spooky takes all the characters from the series; Joe Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Connie, Grandma Mazur and throws them together with Diesel to create an in-between-the numbers novel that shouldn't be missed.<br />This 309-page novel will have you laughing while Plum attempts to catch her FTA and keep her dignity in the process.<br /><br />Morelli, her on again off again cop boyfriend makes a cameo in this novel with a problem of his own. His brother Anthony was kicked out of his house by his wife for having the \\"barn door open and the horse out to pasture, looking to get ridden\\" (39). Now Anthony has moved in with Joe, and as if dealing with a series of gang killings wasn't enough, he has to keep tabs on his brother and keep from killing Diesel for sleeping in his girlfriend's bed.<br /><br />Evanovich doesn't disappoint in this action-filled novel. From sinking in pools of mud in the dark in the middle of the Pine Barrens with Lula to getting tomatoes launched at her by one of her FTA's, Plum's days are not easy. With her getting kidnapped, having a hot stud who isn't her boyfriend staying at her place, and attempting to collect her FTA's without Lula shooting anyone, it's a wonder anything get's done at all. And of course a Plum novel wouldn't be complete without something going terribly wrong with her car. Good thing Ranger is there with his endless supply of shiny, new black cars.<br /><br />No wonder Evanovich is a New York Times best selling author. It's hard to put this book down. Evanovich combines humor, action, sexuality, urban legend, takes a dab of the supernatural and whips it all together in this heart-stopping novel. Take Plum's newest adventure with her and ride around through the Pine Barrens chasing bad guys - trust me you won't regret it.ich combines humor, action, sexuality, urban legend, takes a dab of the supernatural and whips it all together in this heart-stopping novel.

B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Maybe it' is me, but I still significant trouble using this app and viewing PDFs on my Kindle. I can't seem to figure it out. The PDFs won't download.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This movie was recommended to me and pushed off watching it for nearly 6 months.  Finally I sat and watched it... and I am glad I did.  This is an amazing movie for all ages!  It will have you laughing and crying and leave you with a good feeling.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|There are so many cases out there nowadays, across a wide range of prices and with several features.  Ironically I have found that a higher price does not mean higher quality, or even more features.<br /><br />This case fits the Fire HD version of the Kindle.  It DOES NOT fit the regular Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The Vibe from Marware falls in the middle of  price ranges, at around $25.  It is slim and there is nothing extraordinary about the exterior  It is a faux leather, and the back and binding are smooth, while most of the front has a light grainy texture .  It comes in a couple of colors.  I ordered the purple case.  It is a medium purple, not too bright, not overly drab.<br /><br />The rear cover folds so that the case can double as a stand.  The outside closure is a large elastic strap, common among tablet cases.  My first reaction was that this was a no frills case.  When I opened it, my opinion changed.<br /><br />Although there is no tab closure and you don't feel a magnet, the lid has a waken up/sleep feature.  The interior is a smooth material.  It feels like a microfiber and it is non-slip, which allows you to prop up your Kindle at pretty much any angle.  Instead of elastic straps, you snap your Kindle into four plastic corners on a plastic `Y' frame.  This gives you a little more protection on your device corners.<br /><br />So, on the outside the case looks very ordinary, however the snap in corners, wake up feature, and multiple viewing angles are features not often found at this price.<br /><br />I'm digging on good vibrations.  This case is nice, especially for the price.

B0086700CM|5.0|I never get bored with this game. I get frustrated because it gets going faster than I can keep up so I only get so far. I'd like to be able to use a easier level so I could see further into the game I'm just trying to kill time not become a professional gamer. I recommend this app
B005HSL626|2.0|I wasn't real impressed with the game.  It involves no skill and just got boring fast.  Maybe add a chef cutting the fruit and we would have a hit here ????
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I installed TR2 on my Kindle Fire and I have to uninstall-reinstall everytime or it just force closes everytime I try to open it. Other than that its cool, the graphics are a bit too busy without enough contrast. I enjoy it though, it's definately worth getting.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is truly the best addition of Angry Birds there is.  The swords, bombs and the visual is wonderful.  You won't be disappointed and your kids will love this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was trying to find the right word to describe this book, but there are none. I could not put it down, the more I read about Sky and Holder, the more I lived them.<br /><br />It is not happily ever after, instead forever ever after.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Find it is very easy to use. It has different levels, many different patterns from 4 choises of dragons and sound effects.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|My old friend Dan Pink has produced another book well worth the time investment.  To those not familiar with the consultative, needs satisfaction sales approach, this will be an eye opener and, perhaps, transformational.  I am about half way through with it and so far my only point of disagreement is that Dan seems not to be aware that many of the principles he explains have been employed by serious students of selling for much longer than he seems to know about.  He points to much new research that bolsters his points that I was not aware of and which I found most helpful.<br /><br />Sells is nothing more than effective communication.  If you want to be a more effective communicator, read this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is an excellent book - you won't be able to put it down.<br />I am counting the days until Book 3 is ready

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is one of the best animated feature films out there.  It's great for everyone in the family, even the birds, cats, dogs, fish and the lizard.  So gather everyone around the  TV and get some family time in and love the one's you're with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|hello its fun and I love it so I want to keep playing it till I die. haha ya its awesome yeah
B009329Y30|3.0|You'll be the lucky one if you show this movie to your girlfriend and you provide some champagne and crackers with some cheese and maybe light a few candles???  Then again, you might not have a significant other and you won't be so lucky, because you will get very depressed that you are alone and you have to drink all that champagne by yourself.  Looks like an early night in bed for you unless you're an alcoholic and two bottles of champagne don't even phase you.
B005IZLPME|4.0|It's World War II and the US Army needs to up its game in its war against the villainous Nazis under the command of Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Enter Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a little guy from Brooklyn with all sorts of health problems, but who has possibly the strongest sense of morals and courage than any man on the front line. Unfortunately, due to his fragility, Steve is not allowed to join the American army despite multiple tries. A scientist experimenting in a super soldier serum for the US army notices this and offers him a chance to take part in a dangerous procedure that, if it goes well, will grant Steve superhuman-like abilities and enable him to be an ultimate man, athlete and warrior. Steve accepts and transforms into the world's first super soldier: Captain America.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the first test subject of the serum, Johann Schmidt-aka the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)-has come into possession of the Tesseract cube, a powerful energy source rumored to be from Asgard. His plan? Nothing less than overthrowing Hitler himself and taking over the world.<br /><br />If only we had a super soldier to stop him. Wait . . . we do.<br /><br />His name is Captain America.<br /><br />Like all good fanboys, I saw this movie in the theatre. Having grown up on the cheesy Captain America movies starring Reb Brown and, later, the 1990 version with Matt Salinger, a part of me, I admit, was waiting for a repeat of the 1990 film (in the general sense). I was more interested in how Captain America: The First Avenger would tie into the then upcoming Avengers and this movie didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The introduction of the Tesseract-which would be key in Avengers-was real smart on the filmmakers' part because not only did it point to the forthcoming ensemble film, but also gave a quick link to the Thor movie as well.<br /><br />Watching Chris Evans as Steve Rogers was fantastic. He really suits the role and played it perfectly. I wasn't sure how the once Human Torch-all witty and sarcastic-would fare as the famous super soldier, and I'm glad Chris Evans proved he can play a kind of Superman-like character as well. Seeing him play both the small, frail Steve Rogers (facially, anyway, as someone else's body was used), to playing the suped-up Steve made the film truly a story about how our greatest power lies within as opposed to externally.<br /><br />Likewise, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull did a great job, especially since playing villains is no strange task to Weaving (Agent Smith, anyone?). Even with the German haircut he looked different never mind later when his red skull visage was revealed.<br /><br />The story was simple and, like the first Spider-Man movie, I left the theatre underwhelmed. After seeing it a second time, I saw it for what it was and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the end battle was anti-climatic. It didn't need to be an all-out brawl between Cap and Red Skull, but it felt brief considering these two are the heads and tails of the same coin. Some sort of super soldier/titan clash would have punched up the ending. Speaking of which, the ending of this movie has one of the best last lines to a flick ever. It was the kind of line I try to end my own novels on, one that finishes the tale but also has a punch to it.<br /><br />As far as superhero stories go, the World War II setting gave the genre a breath of fresh air movie-wise as, thus, far, pretty much every super flick to come out recently is all set in the modern day. Alternate times and/or worlds with a superhero figure are few and far between. The Spirit is the only one that comes to mind in this regard.<br /><br />After this movie and Avengers, I'm excited to see Captain America: Winter Soldier, which is presently set for 2014.witty and sarcastic-would fare as the famous super soldier, and I'm glad Chris Evans proved he can play a kind of Superman-like character as well.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|They could have cut an hour out of this movie and I don't know why they bothered making this a prequel to Alien.  Great effects but just didn't tie in with Aliens.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Coming from one who enjoys dystopian literature, I've found Hugh Howey's story to be an entertaining and engrossing read thanks to his artful writing style, relatable and smart characters, and a well-constructed (yet wholly unpredictable) plot.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I like this app because it is quite helpful to know what the weather is going to be today or even a day or two ahead of time, and this really helps. As u can see I have put it at a four star rating because there are some things this app can not do, but besides that it is a great app!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great writing! Love this series. Never dull. Characters are well developed. Must start at season to understand what is going on.
0307341550|5.0|absolutely loved \\"Gone Girl\\" so I couldn't wait to read more from the very talented Gillian Flynn! \\"Sharp Objects\\" was a superb but quite disturbing book. Ms. Flynn has a knack of developing characters who get under the reader's skin, which I find riveting, yet borderline creepy at the same time. I read somewhere that characters should be the vehicle in which the story is told, and that is certainly true of this book. Slowly but surely, the layers of each character are stripped away, to reveal the nitty gritty of the plot underneath.<br />I didn't particularly like the protagonist, Camille Preaker, nonetheless I found her compelling. The more we discover about her past, the easier it is to understand her personality. Let's just say that she has the mother from hell, and that's an understatement!<br />This book is a dark psychological thriller, and not for the faint-hearted. I enjoyed it, and plan on reading \\"Dark Places\\" as soon as I've digested \\"Sharp Objects\\".
B009HV2JT8|2.0|We read the book, so were ready to watch the  movie.  Let's just say the movie changed almost every interesting part of the book.  The movie was not a fun ride at all.  Very cheesy.  Should have stuck to the original story.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A must-have for any new Beatles fan (I figure that any existing Beatles fan would either already have this or already have purchased a more expansive anthology or have all the records in original mint condition.) The sticker slapped onto this CD case (which I haven't managed to get off yet) says it well: &#34;27 no. 1 singles on 1 CD.&#34;<br /><br />The CD case was cracked, but that's beside the point. (I'm sure that I could find another empty one into which to switch the CD if I really needed to. What else could I have expected for a 50 cent CD of such great music in a like-new state, anyways?)
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The movie is ok, but not half as good as the previous Bourne movies. Plus you really need to watch more than once to be clear on what is happening.
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|Its predecessor, \\"Mechanize\\", was such a huge come back for these cybermetal/industrial masters, that, although peoples' nature dictated that there would be something as solid or better to come, actually few of their devout listeners, were overly optimistic about the band's ability, given its member changes/comeback, repeat its 2010 success. Well, here you have it: a unique blend of industrial and cybermetal, coated with a twist of murky, but consistently-expressed conceptuality, do the job for the band's devout fans. At first, the album may give a feeling of unnecessary narrative thickness and repetitiousness, but upon closer examination of the material and the story line used to conceptualize the record, it's becoming clear, as one progresses through the work, why the sonic material on the album was designed the way it is. The album has the mood to appeal to the metal fans as well as afficionados of dark electronic ethereal soundscapes. It is definitely a worth item to compliment any collection of industrial and metal masterpieces.<br /><br />The concept has been designed and the soul has been inhaled into it. The rush for the new sonic explorations fueled by lucid story line is on.
B005VPRETE|5.0|my daughter loved this item, she had a hard time fixing it<br />but i helped her and she was very happy when we were done.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|This is a great movie to test out your surround sound with.  My kids ages 5 and 8 both loved it as well

030758836X|5.0|This is another good book that I did want to end.  They are few and far between and only come  every so often.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a great book.  I cried a lot throughout!  It drove me nuts and I threw it down a couple of times but so glad I finished it!
0385344228|5.0|It was a very good book abd I hated for it to done!  I have passed it on to my other friends to enjoy.
0446401307|5.0|I hate to come to the end of a series I really enjoy. Taken out of order, this happened to be the last one and it was a very quick read. I started it last night and finished it tonight. One day. It was by far, the shortest Harry Bosch novel but a good farewell to what was a great run. Admittedly, there are three of the series I haven't read but that's because two are written completely in first-person, Lost Light and The Narrows, and the other one, The Brass Verdict also features Mickey Haller and is half first-person. I can't stand reading that point of view so I have to pass on those three. I am also disappointed that the next one to come out in 2013, the Gods Of Guilt also features Mickey Haller so that means more of that annoying first-person so now I'll have to wait at least another year and hope Mr. Connelly decides to do a pure Harry Bosch novel in third-person.<br /><br />As for this installment, it was a quick read that was full of the usual twists and turns and certainly wasn't what it appeared. I didn't expect it to be, either. I was mildly surprised at the outcome but happy with the ending. At least this time, Harry didn't do anything to morally ambiguous.<br /><br />I didn't get much from the discussion questions at the end as that made me think of those Bible study questions at the back of a couple of thinly-veiled religious novels that I've been tricked into reading in the past,  though this one isn't like that at all. The questions are pretty much useless as there is nobody, especially a reading group I'll ever discuss it with. However, I enjoyed the interview questions which actually had answers.<br /><br />Overall, a good read. Highly recommended.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great book in the Mitch Rapp Series.  If you've liked all the rest, I think you'll love this one.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I got it yesterday and now it wont even open. It always clozes on me! THIS IS TYRANNY (STUPID) UGGHHH!
0307730697|5.0|I just finished reading the book, \\"Fearless \\" by Eric Blehm and I must say that out of the many books that I have read; it is among one of my favorites.<br /><br />It is a dynamic book about the life of a dynamic Christian Navy Seal whose name is Adam Brown.  According to his mother, Adam, was fearless from the time when he was a little boy.  He demonstrated this fearlessness by jumping off of the top of his parents' cart onto the ground at the age of three.<br /><br />Also, during his teen years he consistently performed dangerous stunts like the time he jumped from a moving car off of a bridge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though his family tried to guide him to make the right choices in life, Adam had a difficult time after high school finding his way when he started hanging with the wrong crowd and experimenting with drugs.<br /><br />Adam Brown's story tell about how he was able with God's help along with a loving wife and family to get on track to become the top elite of the Navy Seals.<br /><br />Adam's perseverance and fortitude against all odds is an inspiration to all.  I highly recommend everyone to read his story.  It will have you laughing, crying, shouting but most of all proud of Adam Brown and what he became and represented.  This story makes me proud to be an American.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars and have recommended it to all my Facebook friends.  I think that it should be among books required for reading by our young people because Adam's story demonstrates what \\"faith, compassion for others, perseverance, love, patriotism, and honor\\" truly mean!
030758836X|2.0|Let's just say at the end of the book I had to flip back and forth through my Kindle pages to be sure I wasn't jipped on the ending.  Really???  That's it?  I was caught up in the plot line until middle of the book, then became uninterested.
B00447G29S|2.0|This movie seems to get tons of great reviews but I have not been able to get through it without yawning and wanting to fall asleep. While the story might be sweet for kids, the Tom Hanks characters are tiresome and the 3D effects are lame and not worth paying extra for.  Get the 2D version if you must by this slow sappy turd of a film that is like watching a tranquilizer in slow motion.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a fun and addictive game but I only got to play twice because when I touch the app it will turn on then it would go straight back to my home screen. So annoying
0547884591|4.0|the book you want to read when you decide you finally want to learn how to learn. And not how everyone else learns, but how YOU learn. Oh, and cooking to boot!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I dig it like old school pitfall on speed and steroids only downside is its a great encourager of procrastination
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Great Movie. it's a good man movie.A lot of action of course. No problem with renting or streaming online . Happy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been waiting for this app! One thing that I love about this app is that it is free! The company that made this could put it at least one dollar and still get great reviews. This is a second one to the original temple run.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was very fun even though I had to wait to let the game restore the coins. I will play it again and again.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show. Nathan Fillion is great in everything he does.<br />This show is witty and a great crime drama.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I preordered this and it shipped right away after it became available. Great box set. I bought this for my husband for Christmas.
B00051E906|1.0|Not sensitive enough to be practical.  I consider it usless.  Did not come with batteries, as advertised.  The manufacture refused to refund my money; offering to accept as trade-in on a more expensive model or possibly repair if they though it was defective after examining it.
B00001NTXN|5.0|I got this for my 10 year old son who loves strategy games.  It is simple enough, but challenging.  We play all the time and everytime he gets me!  Great game!
B005KELQEU|4.0|It fits my kindle perfectly. Just wish it would have had a pocket externally to put small paper items. Other than that, it is perfect and well made.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is the best game I have played on my k I n d l e f I r e
B005K2XNGG|5.0|I love this sleeve, it keeps my kindle fire nice and safe. I love the color that matches my kindle fire skin that I just purchased which took it to a whole new level. If I had to change one thing though, it would be to insert a slit in the sleeve to make charging it while it's still in the case easier, instead of having to take it out. That would make this the ideal case...so I'm hoping.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great you can have a horse and play with him groom him and complete different task I love this game my kids play all the time.
B004HD61KE|3.0|Book took a little to get going but was good. Kept it going with historical fact mixed with fiction packed action
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is not the typical liberal propaganda that speaks out against the industry. While it does have the bias, I enjoy it trying to solve the problem and not the symptoms. The problem is that we view food as only a source of calories and don't take in other considerations such as vitamin and other nutrients. The \\"typical\\" American family portrayed in the movie, reminded me of my own. In the sense that the fast food is cheap. However I'm against them saying vegetables are expensive. Lies and Deceit, especially when you drive an SUV. Get a grip on reality and your health. The movie portrays we the consumer as having power to change things. We just need to be motivated to realize that we really do have power to change this world to good, if only baby steps are taken.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Great drama. Best show ever. I can't wait for season seven. We will recomend this show to others. already preordered it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This was the second time that I had seen this movie but the first for my husband. We both loved it. The only problem was it did not play well starting with the last 30 minutes. We had to reset several times.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|Very entertaining with great characters. Don Draper has some very nice looking era specific suits.  Very cool sets as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love story greatly written.<br />Couldn't put the book down can't wait to read more. Can't wait to see the movie either.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about this game. It seemed a bit young, but once I got to explore more in the game I became pretty addicted. I am sick in bed and this is making me feel much better!
B007L6VR12|5.0|Acting ,settings, score were all excellent. The score was more than excellent--it was exquisite!<br />I have recommended it to everyone I know
1400052181|3.0|I suppose I just resented the fact the family were taken advantage of and nobody bothered to tell them anything.  It outraged me even though I know such practices existed, particularly to the poor and to the blacks.  It made me very sad.<br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked it. It read well and held my attention. I would recommend this book for a good short read. You couldn't beat the price FREE!
B009E3EXMU|1.0|I really wanted to like this concert.  Trust me.  I've been avoiding bootleg footage because I didn't want my perception of the reunion to be skewed.  When I bought the CD I rushed to the car and put it in.  I kept searching for an intro I liked.  Specifically I was looking for \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and when I didn't find it, I grew more skeptical.  I generally adore \\"reunions\\" and found the last decades' Police and Cream shows were thoroughly entertaining.  This just sounds so forced.  There's a moment at the end of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" where Robert Plant says, in a clearly pre-conceived way, \\"Hey, Ahmet [Ertegun], we did it!\\"  What does that even mean? It's like that was scripted out of a postlude to \\"Almost Famous.\\"  Coupled with these facts and considering Plant acts likes he's having so much fun yet refuses to do even one more show, I would steer away, especially for such a high selling price, even on Amazon.  Pass.
0525953728|5.0|We got this book for my son since he is so into special forces stories, well he read it in a day and loved it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it , it's a lot different than the first temple run , but it's fun . The different scenes are pretty awesome it's like you're actually in the game. There are also different levels  the make you want to keep playing and get to the next one. You can also use save me`s  to keep playing up to your high score. There are no bad things in the game , that's what I think.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he LOVES it ! Everybody at work is always complimenting him on it and wants to know where to get one ! Needless to say, all of the features on it are awesome and work like a charm !! One of the best knives out !! A Must Have !!

B006LSZECO|4.0|The suspense of what had really happened and how it would all play out drew me in and kept me reading.  It's a pretty twisted story, but I enjoyed it.  I didn't much care for the ending, though.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Pretty much the same storyline as the original Total Recall. Obviously, special effects and graphics were better, but remakes are rarely an upgrade from the originals. My husband and I still like the Schwarzenegger version better.
B000002J03|5.0|What can I say. Led Zeppelin rocks. This album is awesome. I personally think this is their 2nd best. The 1st being Led Zeppelin 4.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Great night of entertainment. We had a neighborhood movie night and we all enjoyed popcorn and a fun action film with great picture
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's Black album or self titled is awesome. If you were only going to get one Metallica CD (I don't know why you would ever do that though) I'd say this one is a good one to go with. Lots of their best work. Highly recommended.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Story is typical & predictable, but characters make the movie a little different & so funny! Not for &#34;small&#34; children.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Love my cover and the color is awesome!!!  The varioius positions works very well, especially if you are reading in bed, etc.!!  Would highly recommend!
B0094M2O7C|3.0|Not as good as I had hoped, but it was available for rent here, but not on Vudu.<br />Not much added to the original premis.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Ok so if you haven't seen it, it's just as awesome as the title suggests. But you have to keep in mind it's only half true to history. If you're looking for anything other than what the premise offers, you're watching the wrong movies.
B003QF8E4A|4.0|A very good production.  DiCaprio is one of our contemporary best. I would recommend to anyone. Pay close attention to all the clues..
B001AW156U|2.0|don’t hold to the controller, they fall every time I'm playing, so I don’t use them any more, just save the shame of buying this things.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter loves the Monster High High School Playset. She plays with it everyday since she received it for Christmas. I would recommend this toy to my friends. The quality is better then I expected having purchased other doll houses that fell apart at the slightest movement in the house. There are a lot of accessories that come with the house & I think it is a really cool toy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg this app is amazing! it works great with my kindle fire and easier to understand than the first temple run.

B00936A0RU|3.0|Believe it or not, I do hate feeling as though I'm harping on an actor.  (This isn't to say I don't enjoy it when it's obviously necessary, but I digress ...)  Some actors show great promise when they're young, and, as they age, they're rewarded with material that, sadly, might be beneath them and their skills.  In other instances, the material may be so horribly written that it's hard to accept any measure of theatrical skill could've saved it.  However, in some noticeable cases, an actor is blessed with the reputation of a master thespian despite the fact that no series of performances warrants the praise.  I tend to think Shia LaBeouf falls into this last category - it's not to imply he's untalented but rather to say I've only seen middling performances (at best) from the man - and LAWLESS puts him in yet another picture that possibly may've benefitted from some fresh blood as a leading man instead of an established box office name.  (So sue me!)<br /><br />(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and character.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />Prohibition is the law of the land, and, in Franklyn County, Virginia, nobody was as `lawless' (see how that works?) as the Bondurant brothers: Forrest (played by Tom Hardy), Howard (rising star Jason Clarke), and Jack (LaBeouf).  In 1931, when the law started catching up with bootleggers if for no other purpose than to get a piece of their action, it was the Bondurants who held out against the corrupt system, preferring to keep their business (and their earnings) to themselves.  This is no small way helped turn Franklyn into the wettest county in the world (the very name of the book upon which this screenplay was based).  When crooked officers tried to shut them down, the brothers fought back, tooth and nail.<br /><br />As for the rest of the story?<br /><br />Meh.  It's all a bit nebulous as incidents that may've been based on real history play out more like structured character `beats' than they do a comfortable narrative.  Jack is the runt of the litter - he's clearly only half as rough and rugged as his brothers Howard and Forrest (both are rumored to be indestructible if not immortal by locals), and he takes the brunt of it when Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce in a weird turn of face) comes down hard on the family.  He's beaten and kicked around solidly for much of the film, so it only stands to reason that, come the conclusion, he'd go all `Billy Jack' on the lawman.  While that may be based on a true account of the affair, it ends up feeling mostly manufactured here.<br /><br />Also, it didn't help matters that LaBeouf ended up being shackled with a hackneyed Southern accent.  He does the best he can with the lines, but, having seen him in so many big budget productions, so much of his dialect here sounded really inauthentic in the bad-community-theatre kind of way.  Hardy was able to pull it off mostly because he had so little to say (Clarke similarly only had a handful of scenes of extended dialogue).  Again, it's a middling performance not all that believable based on circumstances, which is why I said in the onset that I don't want to feel as though I'm piling on LaBeouf given the fact that he's appeared in two out of three TRANSFORMERS films that were pretty awful as well as almost single-handedly destroying every good memory I have of an INDIANA JONES motion picture.<br /><br />Again, if my bias is showing, you'll have to forgive me.  Like most of you, I take my fascination with flicks very seriously - serious enough to write about them increasingly online - and I try hard to not be prejudiced with acting talent.  I think LaBeouf's a diamond-in-the-rough probably a few years more in the making; I thinkhe was wrong for this movie; but I don't hate his work.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain makes a nice turn here as Maggie Beauford, a Chicago dancer who self-deported to Virginia for quieter spaces.  Unfortunately, she's relegated to secondary status here.  I would've loved to have seen more of her, but, alas, the story as scripted simply didn't allow for it.<br /><br />Lastly, let me make a plug here for more films of this nature (those based on historical events).  In particular, I've always been fascinated with America's greatest failed social experiment, Prohibition.  I've read plenty of books on the subject - it fascinates me - and LAWLESS does an admirable job showing us today what it was like `back in the day.'  It these elements I wish we were shown more of - a miniseries much like the recent HATFIELDS AND MCCOYS would be stellar, and even the dry (pardon the pun) PBS documentary PROHIBITION (thank you, Ken Burns) comes to mind - I think LAWLESS would've had a chance at finding a bigger audience.<br /><br />LAWLESS is produced by Benaroya Pictures, FilmNation Entertainment, Annapurna Pictures, Blum Hanson Allen Films, Pie Films Inc., Red Wagon Productions, and Yucaipa Films.  DVD distribution appears to have been handled through Anchor Bay.  As for the technical specifications, this is a big Hollywood production; as such, it all looks and sounds pretty solid, except for a few of Hardy's lines which were (I believe) deliberately hard to understand as his character tended to be fairly soft-spoken as well as a man of few words.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  Knowing what I know of Prohibition, I'd suspect that there's an awful lot more to this story than what was delivered.  At best, the script services the need to tell a story - it sets up each of these characters with the barest of bones, presents a catalyst for drama, and then delivers said climax with albeit predictable results - but I can't help but wonder what more there is to the story that couldn't fit inside the traditional two-hour package.  LaBeouf continues to get starring roles despite his lack of presence - I'd have spent more time with Hardy's underplayed (and underexplored) Forrest Bondurant and Clarke's Howard Bondurant; his character seemed so circumstantial here, that I'm not sure what more he could've added with his limited and overrated skills, but it is what it is.he was wrong for this movie; but I don't hate his work.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain makes a nice turn here as Maggie Beauford, a Chicago dancer who self-deported to Virginia for quieter spaces.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Everything about this product is top notch, the packaging, the extras, the price. And of course the movies, which are all 5-star classics. I would recommend this boxed set to any true Batman fan. 110% satasfied.
0345803493|2.0|I bought this book because it was a Best Seller and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  The book as a manufactured product, was brand new and in perfect condition.  The content, is not my cup of tea.  To each his own.  I would have returned it, but I don't think you can.  Whatever, I'll read &#34;look inside&#34; a little better next time.  No one's fault but my own.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Never Imagined I would like something like this at my age, but hear a lot about it so downloaded it, and it is fun from time to time..

B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is wonderful. I absolutely love it  I would highly recommend this app. The noise selection is great!!!! Totally worth it!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Love the book. so sad.suggested this be a choice for many of my friends who love a family story with a surprise ending. The book was difficult to put down.
B004QX07G4|5.0|First off you can't say anything bad  about this book it's hilarious and so random and I love it . If you didn't read it. Read it or get someone to read it to you then recommend it to someone on the streets or your grandma.. anyone..it's great
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Despite better judgement, I am a Jane Austen fan. This isn't my favorite work by her but it is an easy read.

B000FC1QQU|5.0|Smith continues his touching depiction of the lives of his main characters.  Of particular note is the significant development of Mma Ramotse's assistant Mma Makutse, full of whimsical and unexpected twists.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Way to much swearing and vulgar language in it . It is not neccessary to use this kind of language to make a good book to read I would not recmend it to anyone.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|A unique adventure with some timely messages that both kids and adults will enjoy.  If you are looking for your next family movie in every sense of the word, look no further.  Beautiful stop-motion animation, a clever tale, and some pretty witty dialog make for a great show.
B006CHML4I|2.0|I bought this because I thought it looked nice and would be an inexpensive and serviceable watch for everyday use. And the price made it attractive.<br />My mistake. It does look nice, but it really doesn't work for a set-and-forget daily wearer.<br /><br />Like all automatic (\\"self wind\\") watches, it needs to be worn, and moved around, to wind itself. The problem is that a normal day's activity for me is not enough to wind it so that it keeps running through the night.  So every morning I have to re-set it (including the date) and shake it a little to get it going.  Quality automatic watches don't do this.<br /><br />You can't expect a lot for this price, but the construction isn't very good.  The stem seems flimsy, and you can hear the moving weight inside rubbing against something.<br /><br />If you want a Seiko automatic for everyday use, I'd recommend the Seiko 5 Sports SNZG11 (blue). It looks very similar, it's about twice as expensive, but still reasonable for a reliable self winding timepiece.<br /><br />If you want a cheap (less than $100) watch that you'll set once, wear every day for 3 or 4 years without paying any attention to it, and then throw away, you probably want a quartz (battery driven) watch by almost any manufacturer.<br /><br />This Seiko 7 (SNK807) will wind up unused in a drawer.

0684135051|5.0|Although you can't really learn to knit from this book, the insight, tips and  relaxed attitude of EZ towards knitting will help to relieve self-induced anxiety about getting it \\"right\\". I love her 'just try it' way of approaching knitting. It's helped me see this wonderful craft in a way that makes even mistakes a tool.  It's no wonder that EZ has been called the Julia Child of knitting. She makes it accessible for everyone and fun, too. (and she's very funny!)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|True Mitch Albom style; a story told calmly with grace and style  but captivating.  you won't want to put it down.

1844137864|5.0|This is the best Banksy book out there, not just because it has the best photographs of his work but because this book was created by banks and not some one else.<br /><br />I bought this and &#34;Banksy you are an acceptable level of threat.&#34; I GREATLY prefer this book over &#34;acceptable level of threat.&#34; This is not just full of amazing photographs of his work but it has actual commentary by banksy himself! Its full of his witty and clever sayings that will have you rolling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />But most importantly it contains his philosphy behind art and why he does what he does. Its in his own words and not write by some outside source who &#34;researched&#34; his work.<br /><br />If you love street art and banksy more so, then you NEED TO BUY THIS BOOK!!! Out of the dozens of Banksy books, this is by far the best. After all it was created by Banksy himself.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|While one of my 4 month olds finds  pacifiers generally cumbersome, the other loves pacifiers (specifically this one) and learned early on how to put it back in his mouth. I wish the monkey had a little weight to it (kind of like a beanie baby) so that the pacifier would sit on the baby's chest better if it falls out of his mouth. I definitely recommend this to others. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't make life easier right away (0-3 months old). Be persistent and they'll hopefully get used to it soon.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|If you only know Macklemore & Ryan Lewis for &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; you are in for a treat when you hear this whole album.  It's thoughtful, creative, and has a good mix of upbeat and slower moments.  I listen to it start to finish.  On Repeat.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I was a little bit skeptical about a movie made by a church, from the standpoint of quality and professionalism. Fears were allayed after the first gripping scene!  Great movie for all, but especially for fathers/husbands trying to figure out their role in today's confusing world of machismo, leader, teacher, etc. Great examples of what's really important in life. Very inspirational.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Book club selection, and this time one I could recommend myself. I eventually loved it, but others didn't. I found the constant change in the time line difficult initially, but as the book progresses it gets easier. The concept falls into place. I would probably not have gone beyond the first few chapters, if I hadn't been committed to reading it for the club. But I am glad I persevered. Not every one's cup of tea, but it introduced me to an author I will read again.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you love glee, you will definitely be a fan of this movie. Highly recommended for your next girls night in!
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|I love this mini set! John Mayer is my favorite artist and I this just adds to the great collection I already have of his music.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I finally gave in and downloaded this game, I was really surprised at how much fun it was. I am 53 yrs. old and I find myself playing it all the time. It is not just for kids! The graphics are great, each level is a challenge and gets harder and harder as you go along. I like that each kind of bird does different things and I even like the pigs with their special personality! Get this game now!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its pretty realistic.  really fun!  It actually feels like you are taking care of something and its like I have my own little pet.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed the second book. Can't wait for the third!! May can't come soon enough! Sylvia day is an excellent writer !
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I am a fan of the hunger games trilogy. The first book was freaking awesome, but I feel like since the first book the rest kinda went in a downfall. However the second one was still really good. However, the third one was boring. And the ending seemed rushed.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Great cd- a blast fom the past from the 1980s when all my friends listened to the tape of Rodrigues.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie was wraunchy.  Not my type of movie.  Not sure what I thought we would be watching but I wish I had never spent the money it took to rent it.  It was a good concept that could have been presented more pleasantly than constant swearing and turning a cute teddy into a perv.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This is a story of a husband (Tommy Lee Jones) who has become complacent with their marriage and a wife (Meryl Streep) who wants the romance back in it.  She is timid and shy about it and he seems to be very against it.  She sees an add for a marriage retreat that she excitingly signs them up for.  Of course, Tommy Lee plays the bad guy here for a while until they both find out things about each other that they didn't know during their therapy sessions with Steve Carell. I'll have to say, this is the first time I have seen Carell play a serious part and he does a great job. Their therapy is a hard struggle and so is breaking old habits within their relationship.  But, the end result is worth it.  I cried in some places, hurt for them in others, and laughed during this movie. It has it all and may even make you take a look at your own marriage.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The 8 film set is a great deal for the price and the packaging is great quality. This is a great addition to anyone's movies collection.
0062127241|5.0|It is an interesting book about Pete & The Who. There were things he wrote about that I did not know happened.

0425252868|5.0|Great read! We don't know much about the experiences of German pilots, this fills it in. One of the greatest descriptions of the pilot experiences and feelings flying a B-17 and the sheer terror of everyday. Finally, shows there is honor in battle and even compassion.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Not a huge difference between the explicit and clean versions of songs, but I do enjoy this one much more. I'm glad I downloaded it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|&#34;Homeland&#34; characters are complex and believable, although the government is made to appear more competent than it may actually be.  The subplots of the difficulties of veterans readjusting to life in the States after deployment, the difficulty of living with teenagers in America today, mental illness in the form of bipolar disorder, and bureacratic career opportunists all add to the richness of the plot, and allows the audience to be drawn in and actually care what happens to the characters. Intense story twists and unexpected turns take us on a wild ride through the motiviations of both Islamic terrorists and Washington politicians, and sometimes blur the lines on which is the most malignant.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was intrigued from the first chapter and hooked the whole entire time. Nicholas Sparks is such an amazing author!!!!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Because I watch &#34;Castle,&#34; I couldn't help but visualize the actors in their roles in the book.  I found it very entertaining, and will probably read more of Richard Castle's books.
B0090EKRKU|4.0|Great story and very good animation.  The bright colors were attractive enough to keep my two year old's attention.  I would recommend this movie for anyone with kids.

B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I cannot use either of the cords I ordered.  They do not plug into an electrical outlet!!!!  They were supposed to work with either of my Kindles. Yes, they will plug into the KIndle but what does the other end plug into???  Right now I just have two dangling cords that I can't plug into anything.<br />Your Customer Service is so difficult to contact, I haven't been able to get any help at all.  What am I supposed to do to make these work?
B004QX07G4|2.0|Seriously...I'm NOT Kidding - I found the book very much like reading a television script: perhaps funny as seen as an Ellen DeGeneres show broadcast, not so funny as a book![[ASIN:B004QX07G4 Seriously...I'm Kidding]]
1442444053|4.0|A lovely hard copy of the book with beautiful illustrations.  My only criticism is that it's a bit big and heavy for small hands to hold which is a shame because it is a gift for my nine year old daughter, who loves reading but has mostly stuck to HP so far.  She's started reading it though and really appreciates the quality and lovely writing.  I am sure that once she gets into the story she'll be just as enthralled by it as I was at her age.
0930289234|4.0|I read Watchmen in its entirety on my laptop a handful of years ago and have been wanting a hard copy for awhile now. For the price this is a greeeeeat find. Good used condition and no pages missing to my knowledge. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is it took some time to actually get shipped but whateva I got it in the end!! My retinas thank you.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King.  Have read so many of his books.  Always keeps me interested.  Am amazed by his imagination.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is the perfect size and the way it holds the Kindle for reading is perfect.  The band to hold closed is a great idea also.  Very good protection for the device.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey. I love this! Anxiously await the next episodes. Well worth watching over and over again.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|After playing a while. when I want to play it again it wont even come up and then it just goes back to the main menu.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A story of a human's will to survive against all odds.  Well researched, well written, well done!  A terrific story line that will keep you up late into the reading time of the evening.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting book and was a very fast read. Actually could not put it down as you had to see what was going to happen next. I hated the characters in the book, very shallow people...but I recommend they highly as it will keep you in suspense.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I loved this movie had a great plot and the bat was a alsome vichle thr end was a shocker it has a chance a another sequel aswell
B000069KGM|5.0|The CTA album was great.  I went about 25 years without listening to it, and hearing it again was great....this was their best in my opinion, they had their moments later on, such as parts of Chicago V, but there came a point when they should have just ceased and assumed their rightful place in our collective memories.  It makes me cringe every time a group called Chicago appears in concert.  But once again, CTA was a wonderful, and even cutting edge, album.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|very fun and interesting!I play this every day! it keeps your mind working! the animals look and act so real
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app is great for relaxing and just listening to yourself when you need some time to think.I would recommend it, especially if you get it on a free day like I did :-)
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love this case. It is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere but amazon. I am the kind of person that likes to see what I am buying and not finding this case in a local store was kindnof discouraging or me. Glad I ended up buying it through amazon though. :)
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|My kids got terrified halfway through the movie and I had lost interest myself. It just wasn't what Pixar used to be.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Never thought I would be able to fall asleep using something like this. It's great I'd recommend this if you have trouble falling asleep.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|After watching this movie for myself , I do hope that there is another one in the works. I will see it later on and a Big Thank you to Marvel Comics for doing a great job
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This is a very good comedy/drama movie that makes you want to slow down and appreciate the finer things in life.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|When looking for a great price the three pack is much cheaper than buying all the movies separate. Cause if you bought the batman movies separate  the cost is way more than the three pack for sale
B000OVLINI|4.0|The beginning first 50 pages made me wonder why people liked the book but it is frankly worth being patient as it is an excellent story. I considered it dark but it is beautifully written and the author created great characters. I especialy liked Fermin and Daniel a lot.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Here is one CD set that had Elvis singing Hey Jude by the Beatles. Along with other classic Elvis Presley songs makes this CD well worth the money
0060594896|5.0|Great book!  It is well written and with no &#34;big words&#34; , not a lot of wordage on a page and perfect font. I  love how he has a lot of motivational stories from real people.  It is written like he is right there speaking to you. This book is wonderful and makes a great gift!!
B00136NUG6|4.0|I love the nostalgic music from the 70's and early 80's.  EW&F is one of those bands who's music may be 30 years old, maybe older, but it still stands up as classic and relevant even today.  I have to admit that I listened to the songs that I'm familar with like Fantasy and September and Shining Star over the less familiar songs, but they all sound great.<br /><br />Overall it's a great listen.  I'd recommend it if you want to listen to all the old classics, you may even discover a &#34;new&#34; classic.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Starts you out easy to get you familiar with the game and builds to harder puzzles. Think it could give more hints though instead of having to pay for them. Overall a fun game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it but if you have any children around beware push the wrong button and you'll have to pay for coins when they regenerate over night and it is free that way
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is an incredibly challenging game that takes no prisoners. You will fail more than you ever cared to and makes the original (which was not short on difficulty toward the end by any means) look childish. This one is more elaborate and sensitive to precise careful movements. You will learn a little bit each time with every failure, but eventually conquering the next obstacle provides an incredible sense of accomplishment and hitting the \\"checkpoints\\" are especially elating. I just finished the game Dark Souls which is exactly the same way in terms of difficulty if that means anything to you. My advice, be patient, pay attention to what does and does not work (or at least what has the best probability of success), go slowly on parts that require precision movements but be ready to experiment with new methods such as slight jerking movements and rolling the ball at medium speeds when launching off ramps. Good luck.
1609611543|5.0|Friend introduced this book to me. I started right away eliminating wheat from diet. I had no energy for years, this has made such a difference.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it there a glich for it lol. also the person who made it has to has to. make another 1.Temple run 3and4
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I love Phil Collins music. He has such a grasp of what music should be, and has such a great quality to his voice. It is fun to listen to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally love this game! Beats part one big time! Just love it. Exciting and mesmerizing. Keeps you at end of seat.
B008AITJ24|5.0|Gives a wonderful insight into how forensics works, and how exciting forensics can be. It can get young people interested in doing forensic work.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Crouch keeps getting better with each new book. &#34;Pines&#34; is realistically creepy and a bona fide mystery to boot. And word has it those who read it soon will be in the know when a TV version hits the small screen next year. A great book, but as always, not for the faint of heart.
B00AGH6FD8|2.0|moved too slowly, not enough action, my grandson didn't stay interested in it.  He liked Home Alone 3 much more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is awesome! It's soo addicting and relaxing. I actually spent a lot money on it&middot;_&middot; Shhh. Don't tell anyone!! But, yea it's good. Make sure u get it! :)
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Stiefvater brings a fresh take to werewolves, not the typical full moon, silver bullet lore. I would even recommend this book to someone that doesn't care for this genre.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Any one interested in movies directed by Aronovsky would love this one. This is one of his best movies ever. Mostly about drugs and eating disorders. but as the name implies, it could be generalized to any extreme dream! It truly shows how people pay prices for their dreams. If you like it, then consider watching Black swan also directed by Aronovsky.
B0026772N8|4.0|Found this hard to get into the first time I tried to read it, took awhile to warm to the material.  worth the effort to get warmed up.
B007SY3CEW|2.0|Now I know why it's free! The sound is horrible. Almost every other note is silent. Make sure to read this before you buy this game.
B008GFI418|5.0|Get an inside view of the music recording business. This DVD has some great footage of the early years of George Martin and the groups he worked with.
B000JQOIJY|3.0|I like the album and besides some minor scratches and skipping it plays fine. It shipped fast no complaints.  I enjoy the album.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|enjoyable movie- funny spin on the orginal movie from way back when-<br />fun movie to watch with the family.<br />will watch it again
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run2 is ousom but one day it dident let me play if any body knows how to fix it please contact me;(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Whenever I start playing it I play at least 15 games in a row graphics are awesome &amp;it's good for all ages
B008J05EL8|1.0|I wish there was a book on Kindle Fire and on Office Suite Font and Office app for Kindle.  Can you help me get the most out of my Kindle?
B000SGRONM|3.0|This is a fun book to read around the holidays as it shares a variety of stories containing a lack of cheer concerning the season.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Truthfully, this is the best gaming app I have ever downloaded. I couldn't stop playing it! It's addicting, fun, exciting, and dramatic. I loved the first Temple Run, and was very excited when I saw this came to the app store. You may be wondering why I only rated this four stars, and not five. It does have one flaw that I noticed, and that's why. I noticed that sometimes in the middle of a game, my screen would freeze, and after a few moments, the game would shut down and go to the main page in my Kindle. The game then wasn't saved, and that was a huge disappointment. Though hopefully Imangi Studios will upgrade Temple Run 2 and get rid of the bug, and then everything should be ok. Then again, nobody is perfect, and everything has a flaw. But otherwise, excellent game. I highly recommend you download this app if you haven't already.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|i liked that the book wasnt long, but the unanswered questiong at the end left me wanting more. definately not his best work. hopefully the movie will be better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I find myself playing for hours in my free time. It's one of the best apps I've ever had. It's free, which really add to people not willing to buy.
0316069434|2.0|Like many other reviewers, I'm a big Michael Connely fan. Successful authors, in my opinion, get a little careless in their work, knowing they will be published and will make many sales. Such was the case with Connelly in The Black Box.  I can site many instances, but I would be giving away the story.  If you've already read the book, think of his actions when he first started investigating the four suspects in the murder he was trying to solve.  I'll take one instance; there were others.  Specifically, can you tell me what he was attempting to accomplish by slogging through the mud to get to the mansion owned by one of the suspects? Look in the window, maybe?  Think of his other activies in the same section of the book.  If you haven't read it yet, think about it when you do.  As it turns out, he was contriving this sequence of events to support the conclusion. Very poor writing, in my opinion.  One final instance amongst many.  This is difficult without giving the ending away, so I'll generalize.  Think about the primary antagonist and how he is portrayed as a super tough guy, then turns into a wimp, running away from the action, and then finally, he makes a very unrealistic short-term attempt to be a tough guy again.  This was very unbelievable.  Like one other reviewer, I wonder if Connelly actually authored this book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is the typical evolution of a great concept: bigger, prettier and definitely more fun. Great job. Problem is that it suffers from certain annoying, irritating (and unfair) bugs.<br /><br />For example: sometimes, when you use a reviving emerald, the game crashes. Your progress won`t be saved, and if you happened to have a big score, well, you are screwed.
B009K0OL06|1.0|The program content itself is a five star program ... however, my stream was extremely weak.  The visual quality was very<br />poor.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The one and only Tom Clancy. Holds u to the very end. Can not wait to get my hands on the next one
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A THOUGHT PROVOKING book .....Very different and I am glad I read it.  VERY WELL WRITTEN AND A FAST READ.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Very surprising . many surprises throughout the book. some i didn't like. But it is a really good series. I have already bought the fourth one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Can't stop playing this game .<br />Addictive<br /> Fun entertaining<br />Makes u wanna build etc  I can't stop  playing this wickedly awesome game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|again many surprises. it made me really sad, but not as sad as book three. great series tho. i love fantasy
B00AREIAI8|3.0|graphisme sympa, on s attache mais la progression Est les possibilités d évolution sont beaucoup trop lente, gemmes trop chères et difficile d en obtenir à moins de faire les mini jeux 100 fois d affolés dommage car je ne pense pas continuer du coup
B005CFWJHK|5.0|These are so comfortable to walk in. I would not use them if you are planning on doing a ton of walking though such as on a trip. They are great for everyday use and stylish with a skirt or pants.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded temple run 2 on my kindle fire. I was able to play it but recently when I tried to play it, it goes to the opening screen and then closes by itself. I love the new temple run so hopefully it will be a solution to this problem so I can continue playing (:
0765325950|1.0|I have not been able to read it! I'm disappointed. I preordered the book in September, when I was eight months pregnant. I have been reading fantasy and The Eye of the World series sence 1997. I love Jordan and all his book. I also like Sanderson.<br />I have a collection of fantasy books and all the Eye of the World books in hard cover.<br />I am very disappointed that A Memory of Light is not in Kindle addition yet. My 11 week old daughter does not nap and the only time I get to read is while she is nursing. Because I need one hand to hold her I am not able to read a book. I read Kindle books all the time but I am not able to read A Memory of Light.<br />I have been waiting for this book for years and now I have to wait longer because it is not on Kindle yet. I would have bought the hard cover anyway, because, as I said, I collect them.<br /><br />Maybe I will get to write a nice review about the book, when I get to read it. Until then, I am a very dissatisfied, long time, reader.
1577314808|5.0|I imagine most people will benefit from reading this when the time is right. Of course, some people will think its mumbo-jumbo - and this book isn't for them but if you're on a path of self-discovery, then this is a must read.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE AND IF YOU DONT BUY IT YOUR TRUELY MISSING OUT. EVEN AFTER 15 TIMES IN A YEAR I WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many many great ideas on here, from crafts for the kids, myself, cool picture ideas i even got my husband looking at this for some remodeling ideas for our home and back yard!
B003TT2X72|5.0|A MOVIE THAT TELLS THE STORY OF A RING OF POWER MAKING ITS WAY BACK TO ITS CREATOR AND THE PEOPLE PLOTTING TO KEEP THEM APART. TRUELY A WONDERFUL FILM INDEED
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This is just as dumb as being at the carnival or fair playing it. The only thing thats different...you don't get to keep any of the coins.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Put this app on my Kindle for my grand daughter she loves it and now I'm love'in too... So I'll be hunting for more &#34;D
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I tried this game and could not figure it out and it was so boring that I decided not to waste my time.  I give it two thumbs down!
1594744769|5.0|This book was unlike anything I had ever ever read. I don't really know what I was expecting when I ordered it. But I was really shocked with the way it was written. When I told mom about the book she smiled and said \\"Who thinks like that? Who comes up with such amazing books?\\" She went back to work.<br /><br />This book has a lot of twist. But they are fun and easy to understand. The dark things and the sunny things, this book would make a good read to anyone. No matter what they like to read. It has time travel and and super powers from the Peculiar Children themselves. The writing is so good that it scares you when it means to and makes you happy when it means you to. It was just thrilling. I loved it. Although the first few chapter are a little boring but you do need to read it to understand.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this book!!!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very good book.  It really delves into the man's life and uncovers what a wonderful person he was despite some chanllenges that he faced in his life.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This game is one of my favorites.  The game play is very good and the layout works well.  One of the best apps I've tried.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|When I first got this app, it was cool. But now the avatars won't move when I tilt my device!!!  So annoying!!!!!!!!
0307887448|4.0|This book is FUN, FUN, and FUN. And FUN. It's super entertaining and addictive. It's action packed with futuristic yet a fun view into the past and scary one into the future.<br />The portrait of the future is interesting and not far-fetched. There's a nerdy reality note to the characters that i particularly liked.<br />It's like playing a video game, only you're reading about it. It's a geek heaven with references and historical info on early game development. You will love all the talk if you've ever played DnD, if you haven't you'll wish you did.<br />Warmly recommending to all the geeks out there and/or all the 80s pop culture enthusiasts/nostalgics.<br />Or if you were a nerd in high school.<br />Or if you enter real world only for food.<br />I hope someone makes this book into a movie (and that someone with real acne problems plays the main character).
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This movie is amazing! My review isn't that long, but I recommend this movie for people who like comedies! I just wish I had the choice to just rent it, and not buy the movie!
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I love Mitch Albom's books, but unfortunately not this one.  I didn't think it flowed as easy as his other books.  would not recommend it :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game... its way better then the first temple run with all the mine carts and ropes in it!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It wasn't the typical boy meets girl love story. It kept me hang in  on with every word and emotion expressed in this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is an outstanding sequel to the 1st book and I can't wait for the next book.  Greatest book ever!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book took me only three days to read,I couldn't bring myself to put it down. I guess the reason for that is that you just find yourself in the book. Whether you're the goth girl whose obsessed with older movies, or the boy whose trying to 'participate'. Either way, this book is just amazing.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|What a wonderful recap of a poignant memory from my childhood. Very well done. Loved the live footage. It was like stepping back in time to excited discussions around the supper table wondering if Secretariat would really be able to win the Triple Crown. What a beautful animal he was.
B007M45PMU|5.0|First heard &#34;Ho Hey&#34; on TV and just bought the album and can't stop playing it. That's my signal it's a winner of an album. From the lyrics and acoustic folk rock playing. It is really uplifting and worth listening to. More, please!
030758836X|4.0|This was one of those books that you start calling friends about 50 pages in to tell them that you're really on to something.  Great literary devices, clever writing, bubbling characters that you know are going to get more interesting--and they do.  Until they don't.<br /><br />The off-kilter time line, and the juxtaposition of differing views of the same events was fascinating.  She with her \\"I'm right\\" glasses on and he with his \\"you're wrong\\" glasses on tell the same story from different perspectives.  A great study of how relationships work or fizzle.<br /><br />Even when it starts to get bizzare, you are hooked and can see where this was heading all along.  You've put in your 8-hour day with this book and just like any other work day you want the pay off at the end.  All the characters are in place for the final explosive showdown.  The staring guy at the casino, crazy old dad, the Ozarks crowd--all in place just as they should be, but instead of making a surprise visit, they just disappear.  At the end of this work day, the boss says, \\"I know you were expecting more, but this is all I've got for you.  Maybe next time.\\"  No payoff. In a world of surprises, this ending ranks up there with, \\"I'm surprised I didn't get my newspaper today.\\"  If the publisher believes this ending left an opening for a sequel, this author needs to find a new publisher.  People don't look for sequels when they're let down.<br /><br />So, anyhoo (as we midwesterners say) it is four stars for craftsmanship, and a fifth star dropped off the end to match the book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise.  I am so picky about the books I read anymore, especially romance category.  Most of the time I start them I delete unless they start and continue strong.  I enjoyed the premise and the characters and would read more by this author.  It was hard to put it down.
B0060D2SU6|4.0|Very funny movie!<br /><br />Great watch for the family, enjoyed how Rob acts like a girl. Favorite line, &#34;It's me JESSICA!&#34;
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Fascinating.  Good read.  Novelettes are short, but this left a lot to wonder about.  Get it, read it, then encourage Sanderson to write a longer series about both prequel and sequels to really tell the story!
0307730697|5.0|This book was truly powerful and should be on everyone's &#34;must read&#34; list! I wish we had more people in this world like Adam Brown. He is truly a person to look up too and I thank everyone who helped share his story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is the first good calculator app that I have seen that is easy to use, has all the functions that I would use, and is just perfect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is so great to be able to watch a missed episode.  It is available immediately.  No need to worry if you miss a Sunday, you can watch as soon as the next morning.  I am hooked on this series!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I am a huge Deftones fan and I'm really glad I didn't have to wait so many years for their next album. The whole album is great but some stand outs are &#34;Romantic Dreams&#34; with it's interesting rhythm changes and &#34;Rosemary&#34; with the epic build up to an amazing song. I think this album seems a lot more cohesive in style like the songs were made with a concept in mind, not just a collection of songs packaged together. In the past it seemed like, to me, they were &#34;trying things out&#34; and putting together classic Deftones (loud, heavy, screaming) and trying Team Sleep Deftones (quite, more beats, slower). Koi No Yokan is more concise and consistent than previous albums and is best listened to as a whole for maximum effectiveness.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game! I like the sim type games where you can create your own city. It's great to pass the time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|if you are trying to get back into workout mode after the holidays, this one is great. Good work out, fun & easy to come home after work and pop it in the DVD. I felt the burn/sore the next day. I did level 1 the first week, level 2 for the second week, and will be doing level 3 for my last two weeks.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|overall a pretty good game but I only got to play it once it will not load on my kindle fire.
B00A5IYC38|4.0|It is not a great work of art but it portrays an interesting phase in youth culture in Britain. And I like the music and the scenes in Brighton.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I read this but kept thinking, why am I reading this teenage story.  It was a entertaining book but more for youngsters.  I did enjoy the read but wouldn't recommend it for the over 30 population.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|The graphics are nice and the 5 day forecast is sweet. I would of given 5 stars but it only works in one position on the Kindle but other than that is pretty nice
B00942S4OY|5.0|Great collection of music.  My granddaughter loves this group and it was great to be able to pre order this for her.  She really enjoys my gift.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As usual, I loved this fifty shades book. Book two was my favorite, but this one wrapped everything up in a tight little bow with plenty of closure and no &#34;what happens next&#34;
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Could not put this book down. I had tingles reading the entire thing. Loved Travis! Got a little frustrated at times with Abby's indecisions, but I guess the book wouldn't have been as complete or long without them. It also gave me more time to root for the couple. Can't wait for Travis' version to come out in April!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nicholas Sparks doesn't dissappoint. He constantly writes beautiful love story with a little angst and struggle but in the end it was great.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad piggies is one of the best games I have ever played.my kids love this game so much that they won't stop playing.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love angry birds. I always play the 17th level on the first season. It takes place in space. I thought that angry birds space only took place in space.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think it is a great game and i like it.I think your kids will have a lot of fun with this game.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|The game is fun however on some of the diner levels the meat patty option does not work. Also to play levels of different diners additional money required.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This surprising documentary reminded me of what an artist does and why they do it. I would rent it now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My sons enjoy playing this game. They have competitions with each other. I think it's an amazing game. Everyone should try it.
B008J05EL8|1.0|A WASTE A $4.99. I COULD NOT USE IT. IT WOULD NOT OPEN. I DELETED IT.<br />AMAZON SHOULD NOT OFFER THIS PRODUCT & SHOULD OFFER REFUNDS.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I lost my original The Expendables movie but the combo pack made up for it since it plays on different venues.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a good read. I enjoyed it just as much as the first. I thought the book was a great continuing of the first book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought Mockingjay was exciting all the way through! It kept me reading and wanting to turn the pages. Good for teenagers on up.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like this case because I almost bought the $40 option then saw this one.  It was cheaper but still really nice and does the job. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c on the inside, it looks like it has a little pocket...but, it doesn't. since i travel with it, it would be great stick my $$, boarding pass, etc in and I'm always messing with it when reading. Quirky, i know!<br /><br />overall, this is a great case with lots of color options! love it.

1608871452|5.0|As an avid Supernatural fan, this was a must have to complete a collection.  This book was worth every penny. The collectible items tucked in the corners and here and there must made the book even better! I recommend this book to any die hard Supernatural fan because it takes you city by city, monster by monster that the boys have encountered in their eight years on the job. A must have!!

B007V4530A|5.0|This a perfectly distilled yet complete manual for designing an effective speech. I have been speaking professionally for 10 years and was thrilled to find a compilation of everything  I needed in one book with no fluff.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This book is good but I'm glad I already know the story because like everything Hugo writes, it is superfluous in the description of everything!! After seeing the stage production numerous times and now the current movie, I am glad to be reading this book to understand the differences between those two interpretations and to understand how well the movie really does follow the book.
0765325950|1.0|I haven't read the book yet because the ebook version wasn't available on the release day, as a result, I'm giving this book a 1-star review for publisher stupidity.
B000002OYB|3.0|Meatloaf is who he is and so are most of his albums.  I bought several other than his hit albums just to complete my collection.  Can't say any one song jumped out (i.e. there is no paradise by the dashboard lights) so, if you like his music style buy it.  If you are looking to be blown away, don't.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love this case! It's such a wonderful color and true to its name it allows the Kindle to swivel (vertically or horizontally) in order to prop it up so it can stand freely. I have no complaints whatsoever.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is an excellent book that gives scientific evidence, in a readable format, on why wheat is one of the leading causes of our health epidemic in the united states.  A good read and I highly recommend it.  I'm now on a path to make my diet gluten free even though I don't have allergies, etc.
B00821OW8K|3.0|Clunky post alien invasion series,  with enough to keep me watching,  though I am occasionally wincing.  There are some interesting ideas here,  but the level of acting/writing is just not good enough.  I particularly hate how all the kids speak,  like no writer has ever been near a kid in his/her life.  But the big picture stuff is interesting,  and I like discovering more about the aliens. I only hope that the next series is better.  Still,  nice to see Dr Carter all grown up and now a history professor.<br /><br />I watched it to the end of the first series but I have to say I was seriously underwhelmed.  I really wanted it to be better but if anything the writing grew clunkier, and the only really interesting character was that of Pope, the ex con cook/bomb builder.  If everyone had his spark it would have been an amazing show.
B00538MG6A|5.0|Early in the 1995 film Get Shorty we see a clip of Orson Wells' film noir movie Touch of Evil, released in 1958. In the 1960s the French New Wave films paid tribute to American gangster movies. Elmore Leonard wrote the novel Get Shorty, on which this film is based.<br />Many Hollywood films are based on Elmore Leonard novels. Quentin Tarantino based his film Jackie Brown on the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch. Tarantino's film Pulp Fiction is a tribute to Elmore Leonard and other pulp writers. Out of Sight and Be Cool are also based on Elmore Leonard novels.<br />Get Shorty has an excellent cast: John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. All the action takes place in LA. The film is the story of two bit thugs and gangsters, the kind of people we find in pulp fiction novels.<br />For more information on this movie I recommend the editorial reviews on Amazon's product site and the special features on the blu-ray.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|2012 was a big year for Alfred Hitchcock; all of the projects and plans were exciting, two movies, DVD box sets, more.. As a major fan of the iconic director - my website, thornhillatthemovies.com gets its name from the character played by Cary Grant in \\"North by Northwest\\" - anytime my idol is recognized is cause to rejoice. The first project, \\"The Girl\\" is an HBO Film based on actress Tippi Hedren's experiences making \\"The Birds\\". The more I heard about this film, the less I wanted to see it. During a press conference promoting the project, which apparently takes a very critical look at Hitchcock's strangeness and proclivities, she talked about his mental and physical abuse, his harassment, and the terrible experience making the film. About a month later, an interview by Robert Osborne with the actress was featured before a special one-night screening of \\"The Birds\\" in movie theaters. In both instances, she is getting paid to talk about what a terrible experience she had. The thought of this just turns me off, much like so much reality television. Why perpetuate bad memories and experiences and put them in the public eye? What good does it do after so much time has passed? The only reason is to make money and put you in the spotlight. Anyone who knows anything about Hitchcock knows he was a strange man with some darkness and we know the broad strokes about the filming of \\"The Birds\\".<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" directed by Sacha Gervasi (writer of \\"The Terminal\\") and starring Anthony Hopkins as the Master of Suspense, Helen Mirren as his longtime wife and collaborator, Alma Reville, Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles and Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's longtime assistant, is another story entirely.<br /><br />From the moment the trailers first started playing in the multiplex, two things were clear; \\"Hitchcock\\" would concentrate on the filmmaker's life while making \\"Psycho\\", a turning point and very important time in the filmmaker's life and it would have a certain `tongue-in-cheek' quality the filmmaker himself would appreciate and embrace.<br /><br />These are the best aspects of the film.<br /><br />For a filmmaker who worked fifty plus years and created some of the most memorable films ever, a feature length film could and should never cover his entire life or career. It's smart for \\"Hitchcock\\" to concentrate on a relatively short period of time, giving us as much insight and detail as possible.<br /><br />\\"Psycho\\" represented a turning point in the director's career. Still reeling from the critical and box office failure of \\"Vertigo\\", a very personal film, the director turned to subject matter he knew well and made \\"North by Northwest\\", which was a huge hit. And the studios wanted more of the same. But Hitchcock was bored with the formula and wanted to make something that would provide a challenge. When he found the inspiration, a true-crime book called \\"Psycho\\", no studio wanted to make the film with him, so he made it \\"on the cheap\\", shooting the film in black and white, with many crew members from his television show and paid for it himself. When the film was completed, he made a deal with Paramount, a deal which would ultimately make him even wealthier and, in a way, ensure his legacy. \\"Psycho\\" represents a turning point in his cinematic style and his attitude toward the business of filmmaking.<br /><br />If you go to YouTube and search `Hitchcock' and `Psycho', one of the options you will be able to see is Hitchcock's original trailer for \\"Psycho\\". They didn't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing. He decided that no one should be admitted to the theater after the film started. Why? To build curiosity and suspense for the shocking twist about thirty minutes in. For the trailer, he wanted to do something different and decided to stay away from clips. Hitchcock was easily the most famous and recognizable director of the time, he was a star, aselling point, so he takes us on a tour of the set, visiting the Bates' house on the hill, the motel's office and room #1. Inside the room, he  points at the shower \\"Oh, you don't want to even think about what happens in there.\\" That type of thing. It is very clever and very tongue-in-cheek. One of the trailers for \\"Hitchcock\\" features Hopkins in character, sitting in a recording studio, presumably doing a radio ad. Instead he begins talking about how cell-phones and texting during the film can make you go \\"Psycho\\". It's a very clever nod to the filmmaker's own promotions and a memorable way to get the word out about this new biopic.<br /><br />There are some good and some bad things about \\"Hitchcock\\". Basically, the bad things are that the film doesn't really go into enough detail or go far enough.<br /><br />The cast is good and they seem to relish the opportunity to play these famous people. Hopkins does a very good job as Hitch. Wearing a body suit and the suit and ties the director made famous, he adopts the man's mannerisms and speech patterns. Anyone who makes films like \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Frenzy\\", \\"Psycho\\", \\"Rear Window\\", \\"The Trouble with Harry\\", \\"The Birds\\", etc. and makes them as well as Hitchcock did, has to have some darkness, some weirdness. And Hitchcock certainly had both, which has been well documented. Hopkins and Gervasi portray some of these points, hint at some and avoid others entirely giving the portrayal an interesting depth you only wish went a little further. He stares out of his bungalow window at a blonde woman who walks across the lot at the same time every day. Both Peggy and Alma know about his desire for blondes, so they seem to accept his longing stares. He casts Vera Miles (Biel) as Marion's sister, a brunette, to use up her contract and provide a slap on the hand for some of her personal choices. But they could have gone further, explored and explained more making the performance great.<br /><br />This is the first time in a while Hopkins has actually portrayed a character. In so many recent films, he seems to be simply reading his lines or doing another riff on Hannibal Lecter. This is sad because Hopkins is such a great actor and it is difficult to watch him do less than great work. In this film, he dons a body suit and make-up to help transform into the director. But he also adopts the distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms of the famous icon. The portrayal is more real and interesting than a lot of his recent work. It is also a little irreverent, and something you think Hitchcock might have given his stamp of approval..<br /><br />The relationship between Hitch and his wife, Alma (Mirren) is also nicely illustrated. The film gives us a glimpse at Alma's lifelong role as a silent creative partner - they first worked together on silent films in the `20s - .providing input into every aspect of the creative process from choice of material to editing. Mirren does a nice job of illustrating her fatigue and weariness of her involvement.<br /><br />Mirren also has the opportunity to portray different aspects of her role as a wife to one of the most celebrated, famous men in the world. She modestly enjoys what the fame and money brings them, but also tries to keep centered and grounded. At times, she even seems to wish she could live a simpler life. But when the film's budget spirals out of control, and her lifestyle is threatened, she becomes aggravated and testy. Mirren is a great actress and this is good work. But there is a layer missing that would make it great work.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh and James D'Arcy (\\"Cloud Atlas\\") plays Anthony Perkins, the stars of the film within the film. Both were rising, if unspectacular, actors when cast by Hitchcock. Remember, he was footing the bill, so he wanted people who were cheap. And each portrays their `greenness' to the whole idea of Hollywood. Johansson has more screen time and more opportunity to paint shades of the naivet&eacute; Leigh might have had. There is a nice scene depicting Leigh and Perkins on the set, walking towards the camera. Perkins comments how this film will be a nice change of pace for them both, from all of the romantic fluff the studios usually cast them in. It will make them sit up and notice. This is a telling moment because Perkins would become typecast and his most memorable and successful roles would always be as madmen, crazy people and really intense and driven characters.<br /><br />Toni Collette is good as Peggy Robertson, Hitch's longtime secretary and collaborator. There is a hint of the influence she had on the director's career - if Alma was the final word, Peggy was the first - but again, it just doesn't seem to go far enough. One reason is that she simply doesn't have enough screen time.<br /><br />I wish Gervasi had dug a little deeper. There are a few moments when we watch Hitchcock observing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott), the man who would become the inspiration for Norman Bates, as he performs some of the terrible acts that would provide inspiration for \\"Psycho\\". Hitchcock stands nearby, watching, commenting to us about the action, as though he is reading the book and picturing these scenes in his mind. But we don't get an idea of why this material was so inspirational to the director. Unless it was purely for the shock value.<br /><br />The tongue-in-cheek nature of the film is good, and fitting, and the details the filmmakers provide about Hitch's life and filmmaking method are interesting. But balance between the two is never achieved and results in an uneven, marred portrait of the Master of Suspense.has actually portrayed a character.

B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I read...<br /><br />\\"Rock Candy Funk Party is the brainchild of Bonamassa's drummer Tal Bergman and guitarist Ron DeJesus - the two issued an album in 2007 called Grooove Vol.1 - who began a series of jams at Hollywood's famed jazz hotspot, The Baked Potato. Bassist Mike Merritt and keyboardist Renato Neto soon joined in, and finally Bonamassa decided to give it a go. The quintet clicked, and after a few more appearances they took their act into the studio.\\"<br /><br />Think of a place the size of a large garage but the garage band is made up of some of the best musicians in the world. It's downright obscene how lucky some people can be to luck into a venue like that. I'm envious.<br /><br />This is one fantastic collaboration of musicians consisting of Joe Bonamassa (guitar), Ron DeJesus (guitar), Mike Merrit (bass), Renato Neto (Keys) and Tal Bergman (drums and producer).<br /><br />This is 70's/80's improvisational funk groove with a generous smattering of fusion jazz , which is covered with a heaping helping layer of progressive rock. Just like Jeff Beck dishes out on a regular basis. The guys push the boundaries on this one with an endless driving bass and drum line characteristic of funk music.<br /><br />\\"Featuring nine tracks, eight originals and one cover, the album is full of space and texture, mashed up funk, jazz, rock and virtuoso musicianship. A bonus DVD is also included that features a making-of featurette, two in-the-studio featurettes and the official \\"Octopus-e\\" music video.\\"<br /><br />I hear a Herbie Hancock/Miles Davis influence but with the Band's own spin on every song, making them their own.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />Bonamassa:<br />\\"For me, this is great. I've had a solo project for a long time, and I did the Black Country Communion thing, which was more of a democracy, although something of an ADD-fest. I really love being in a group, and in this situation, I'm by far the most untrained, unqualified musician in the room. I like that. It makes me a better player.\\"<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa is a busy man. The group only had 10 days to put this together, and all originals mostly with the end result being perfection. The ten minute epic funk-fest \\"The Best Ten Minutes of Your Life\\" is in my opinion one of the stellar performances on the CD. I respect JB's approach to life and his music, he is definitely a team player blending in and not trying to showboat. His riff-mate Ron DeJesus is a captivating performer, very energetic, with notes tripping across the fretboard at amazing speed, changing direction with lofty precision but still fitting, seamlessly, into the performance.<br /><br />\\"Instrumental groove record\\" is exactly what this record is. Or, you can call it funky rock-jazz, acid jazz or fusion jam music. Whatever label you apply, it harkens back to the golden era of raw and funky electric groove music perpetrated by merchants like Harvey Mandel, Jeff Beck and Herbie Hancock's Headhunters.\\"<br /><br />\\"We Want Groove\\", and this world class group delivers. RCFP is another departure from the norm by JB and as usual a fresh spin on old timeless musical styles is achieved. Some die hard fans may not take to this offering because it strays from JB's usual musical rock/blues recipe but I feel that he will gain a whole new following. The fusion funk followers. I really don't give a rats petunie, it's JB and the musicianship is crank !<br /><br />Go JB Go, you the man !. It makes me a better player.\\"<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa is a busy man.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|For all the people who liked Temple Run 1 you will LOVE Temple Run 2. It is equally as hard as the first (maybe harder) it has more things too. Hills, logs, fire, mine carts, rope swings, etc. It's great fun for all ages!
B00000IQV7|5.0|Are you kidding this is a roller coaster of fun and drama.  Rolled together with great performances by P.S. Hoffman and R Williams, how does one go wrong?
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The movie was supberb! Yes, The qualty was not totally there, but otherwise, it was viewable. Yes, I would recommend this movie.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|This book was everything a fantastic book should be, a new perspective, clever clever clever, thrilling, and characters that you invest in. I was so sad to finish this book, it is one of my all time favourites. Fascinating, impressive, and bloody lovely.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again. Good clean romance with some suspense that keeps you wanting more. Couldn't put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing Flo free it is so addictive, I play it every spare time I got. Cannot put it down
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book; it kept my interest and actually had an exciting ending.  It was quite predictable as most of the Sparks' novels are, but it was a good read.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I ordered this case for my kindle fire because I carry it everywhere and wanted to keep it protected.  This is great.  It is also a wonderful portable stand that allows for lazy reading and watching movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started reading this book I was drawn in immediately.  It was not till I had finished that I realized I had also read another book by this author - also excellent!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this album.  All the songs on it are really good. And I listen to it at least once a day
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is really fun but one time I tried to play it it loaded than went back to home screen stinks right.<br />-Tessa
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Deftly written, and always intriguing, this inside look at Lincoln and his people skills during his years as our Civil War President is the inspiration for Spielberg's brilliant film on Lincoln. My highest recommendation.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had so many twists and turns. Just when you think you have it nailed down and figured out, you get another curveball. Really liked it :)
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|great recording and good quality.  highly recommend this product.  was ordering after hurricane sandy and was quite pleased with shipping and product.
B008EKOO46|5.0|A very pithy and readable study of indigenous cultures. They have a lot to teach us! I would recommend this book to those who have a yen for anthropology as well as others who just like a good read.

B002YCVX5S|2.0|I don't want to see some dude get beat to death with a baseball bat, even if he is a Nazi.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|So close, so close! It's fun and addictive, and there's a new feature that I really loved: the ability to use &quot;gems&quot; to save your character from certain death.<br />Unfortunately, every 7-10 runs, I've noticed a tendency for the game to crash when I try to use a gem.<br />Because of that, I sadly had to drop a star from my rating.<br /><br />However, I really like that this game is not a money trap! It's possible to buy gems, but if you're patient enough you can collect gems while running. (Gems appear in about 1of every 3-5 runs)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not normally a King reader, I have to say this kept me riveted to my screen.  I neglected housework and a few meals, too!  I love historical fiction and this was the bomb!  Great story, great details, almost believable,even.  I loved the characters, they had so much life, like you were there with George, but writing in first person will draw you in like that.  It is just THAT good!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down.<br />Highly recommend this book! Stop asking why and just read it!
B0087WRGVY|5.0|From a person who grew up in the 80's and AOR bands. I have been looking for a band that carries that same up-beat, great guitar rifts and overall great music. If you are from that era you will really enjoy this band!<br /><br />It has been a while since I bought a whole album and enjoyed every song...the last was Shinedown!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I feel awful about giving such a short review for such a great book.  But I prefer writing my reviews right after I read the book, so my memory is fresh and I can do a much better justice to the description.  Unfortunately after finishing reading \\"Ready Player One\\" I moved on to something else equally interesting and completely forgot to do this book justice.  Hence this short review:<br /><br />\\"A fast paced near future sci-fi adventure that is going to blow your mind. Definitely my top read of 2012. It was fun and sort innocent book that is perfect for all ages. I literally did not want it to end. Beware it's highly addictive. 100% recommend!\\"<br /><br />That's really all you need to know to pick up this great read.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|My nephew is an Avenger fan, especially Iron Man!  He keeps playing this movie on and on and on.  He never gets tired of it!  I enjoy it too.  Like the story, the action and effects!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny cause vomit ia funny and the music is really good breakfast club reference wooo! Dont you forget about me
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fast paced, smart, addictive. The protagonists are capable and compelling. The overarching theme is a little overdone, but that's a small complaint for this page-turner. You won't regret Wool.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|The great mystic vision of the 20th century -- seeing beyond the veil - sci fi style. This movie is genius.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Works for my PS3, however need to understand PS3 does not allow Audio/Mic Input via USB port. My TV has Audio out 3mm plug, so i put Audio plug on TV and Mic input to PS3 with USB adapter. comfortable for extended usage 3+ hours no problem, owned now for 1 year...
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|I remember ol' Ben Harper when he was just Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals (how's that for an oxymoron, LOL). Now, he's teamed up with the master of the autotune by the name of Chuck Musselwhite. Let me tell you homeys all something, right here and right now: I feel that Ben Harper music with autotune is some of the finest song production I've ever heard since the brilliance of Glee! Foshizzle!<br /><br />Let's take a song such as I'm In I'm Out And I'm Gone, which is clearly about having sex and then leaving your lover (read: one night stand) lying breathlessly and half-consciously on the stained bed sheets as you head out the door, never, ever to call his or her clingy a/s/s ever again. This song spoke to me because I hope to have experiences like that over and over and over again...when I finally lose my virginity, tee hee! Oh yeah, and the autotune in this song rocked my world, playa!<br /><br />I also enjoyed the smooth, smooth trappings of You Found Another Lover, which just got inside of me in a way that no song ever has before! I'm still melting at the sheer excitability of this song and its effects on me. I particularly enjoyed how You Found Another Lover features autotune to the point where Harper's voice becomes distorted to Britney Spears and Katy Perry levels. I absolutely loved the wa-wa-wa effects in his voice and the near-perfection of the whole sound that it couldn't possibly be real. It's like it was...unreal or something!<br /><br />Even though it's likely a safe bet that Ben voted for Obama--as 95 percent of his bros did, too--I still love his new CD-collaboration with autotune master White Mussel. While you should get this CD ASAP, I sincerely sympathize with you if Obama's high debt is preventing you from either keeping your job or finding a new one to be able to afford new CDs. Just pawn some old stuff to afford this CD!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I really loved this book and can't wait for more of the same. The writer kept me captivated and I couldn't hardly put it down. I would recommend it to anyone that loves medieval tales.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I think Tegan and Sara are the nicest thing that has ever happened to emo music and folk music. I have enjoyed them ever since I heard them in their first band called That Dog, singing sweet, sweet songs such as I Just Threw Out The Love Of My Dreams. However, from there, these two Adam Lamberts have only gotten bigger, badder and better. Fo/s/h/i/z/zle.<br /><br />While I am excruciatingly grateful for their new direction--synth-pop meets Disco Inferno--I am even more grateful that they have produced a non-stop array of songs that are very profound, deep and meaningful on Heartthrob. Let's take the first offering, shall we?<br /><br />I Was A Fool is clearly a song praising the state of Massachusetts for legalizing g/a/y/ m/a/r/r/iage, which is rad, dude, mainly because Obama told me so. I also love the diversity in the song choices on this CD. It's like Tegan looked at Sara who looked back at Tegan as she was still looking at Sara and said, \\"Let's make a CD with absolutely no agenda, okay? Okay!\\" Other winners are Now I'm All Messed Up (endorsing g/a/y/ m/a/r/r/i/age) and Shock To Your System (condemning traditional m/a/r/r/ia/ge). So it's great to see how unbiased and totally agenda-less this CD is!<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel that you need to purchase this CD, stat. It will teach you all about the awesomeness of these Perez Hilton girls, faster than you can say, \\"Let's End Don't Ask, Don't Tell right now!\\" Thanks to the age of moral-relativist tolerance from Obama, you should buy this CD and do your part to support the end of traditional m/a/r/r/i/a/ge!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As with his other books I just loved it. It's like I am living the life but it's nice I don't get be headed. I can't hardly put the books down. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mid-eval.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have loved Andrea (what kind of a name is that, though, for a non-lady?!) ever since he was part of the three amigos that included Pavarotti and Placido Domingo! Am I right or what, folks?! Yeah. When I heard that he'd be coming out with his first CD since last year's Believe, I dropped my garlic ice cream, put on my plumber's hat and called my Mama Carloota to tell her the good news (she's a local neighborhood marm in my neighborhood).<br /><br />I have to criticize, though, his choice of singers whom he invited to passionately sing his Italian tunes on this CD. He would've been better served if--instead of Nelly Fartado and J-Loo--he would've invited true superstars of the highest, musical caliber to guest-sing. I'm talking about, of course, none other than the Insane Clown Posse, Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit, Ke$ha, Lady Gaga (when she's not busy ripping off Madonna), and Jim Johnston from the WWE.<br /><br />That minor critique aside, this CD is definitely worth all your money, which you likely have very little of these days as Obama has intentionally kept the unemployment rate at 8 percent to create a permanent welfare class (the 47-percenters, if you will). I'm going to now briefly review some of the stirring, Italian songs of amore and linguini that you'll find here.<br /><br />Champagne is clearly blind Andrea's heartwarming ode to his nearly alcoholic fondness for red and white wine. I was so fond of this sweet, little ditty that I had my first taste of champagne while listening to this instant classic of passione. A Mano a Mano is easily another winner, referencing the age-old, Italian tradition of gesticulating wildly and passionately with your hands because you can't communicate effectively with your mouth. Ah, porca miseria...porca miseria!! You feel me, playa?<br /><br />Folks, I can't say enough good statements about Passione. Except, vengo! Vengo!! If you want to feel what it's like for a blind, Italian dude with a female-ish first name to serenade you with some of the sultriest, most heat-seeking and inflamed love songs of all time, then I strongly insist that you buy Passione right this second. Sure, you can always say, \\"Ho caldo!\\" when you're vengo, but I suggest you simply fatti gi affair toui! Got that? Good. Porca misera...I accidentally thought that Andrea was a woman's name, when it's really actually a Greek name! Porca miseria, I say...por-ca...miseriaaaa!you with some of the sultriest, most heat-seeking and inflamed love songs of all time, then I strongly insist that you buy Passione right this second. Sure, you can always say, \\"Ho caldo!\\" when you're vengo, but I suggest you simply fatti gi affair toui! Got that? Good.

B007SGM084|5.0|I really liked the series. Very easy to read & get drawn in. Will definitely look into more of her books.
1616550414|5.0|I'm glad that the Japanese individual who is said to be the creator of Zelda (and Mothra, too) finally came out with this book, because we Nintendo fan girls sure as heck need it to keep up with all of the confusing, Japanese anime that Shigeru's come up with. This book is so awesome, I got an advanced copy, that I'm seriously considering using it to help steady my desk (it has one leg that's shorter than the other three).<br /><br />I learnt (yes, that's a word, too) a lot by looking at the very pretty pictures and d/o/o/d/les in this book. Lots of stuff that I learnt was stuff that I didn't know about before. For examples, did you know that Link is actually part \\"little person,\\" which accounts for his pointy, elflike ears? It's true! Shigeru writes it in this awesome paperweight of a book!! Another stunning fact that just blew me a new one was that, apparently, Princess Zelda did a lot of \\"experimenting\\" back in college, which means she likes girls and boys, too. Finally, Link's horse--I think it's named Bucephalus or something stupid-sounding like that--is actually a pony that has been misidentified ever since 1980. It's doubly true!!<br /><br />Folks, I'll kid you not: I am a h/a/r/d/c/o/re Archie and Betty and Veronica manga fan. I think Archie manga comics are the most engrossing and intellectual comics of all time, easily beating anything Nintendo-ish. However, even I must succumb to and acknowledge the awesomeness of this sweet, sweet paperweight book. Please, do yourselves a favor right now, drop what you're doing, and purchase this book--stat! You won't regret it, even if you soon won't have any handguns anymore to protect yourselves from criminals, thanks to Obama's gun control a/s/s/a/u/lt.
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|I am not a musician, I barely understand the complexity of music, but I know what I like and what I don't, this i love.  Kiwanuka's voice resonates with you and makes you feel as though you stepped back a few decades.  Although, it sounds retro the album is refreshing.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game starts out great, as you move up the levels it starts playing it's self. Every other turn you take there are &quot;no more move&quot; and the board resets.  Gets boring fast.<br />Can you do something about that? Also might be cool if the little timer bonuses that don't get used come back up in the next cleared board.<br />Jewels star-- New name: NO MORE MOVE
B007REAIUE|4.0|JD McPherson, to me, is a very rare talent for the 21st century. You can hear his soul in this 1950s-esque sound.  If you love rock at its roots, you should purchase this album
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I ordered this.  A little raw so I would not recommend to young viewers but to adults it is really funny
B005OCFGTO|5.0|its package size was perfect for taking it on trips, my girlfriend loved it. All 8 unscratched. HP helped me get lucky. thank you HP.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is like a Hunger Games, but has more fantasy and I would love to read it a second time. Thomas has very strong personality towards the end of the book, but first off he seems very cowardly in the beginning.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think its a great game because the graphics are great andirons needs skill to play.Also I love this game because it gives you something to do!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Good action here.  Liam does a good job in this one. Plot keeps moving. Not over the top but certainly worth watching.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I never played UNO with the added rules and I'm loving that part of the game! I can't wait to try my new skills with a live person, thanks to this game!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Reading the whole series. Give the series a 5 star. Holds interest and is funny. Would be better if you start with book 1 not with book three like my daughter did.
0525478817|5.0|I didn't put off reading The Fault in Our Stars for any particular reason. Truth be told, I waited to read this one mostly because I was low on fundage to spend on buying books. Despite everyone else's ravings about The Fault in Our Stars, I just put off buying it until my mom gave me a gift card for Christmas. And thus it was purchased and thus it was read.<br /><br />I now firmly agree with the raving John Green fans out there that this man is perhaps brilliant. And The Fault in Our Stars is definitely brilliant. I was hooked on the story and Hazel, the main character, no later than page 10 and laughing out loud no later than page 19. And of course squalling like a baby before the end.<br /><br />John Green takes you on a magnificent and emotional journey. There are many of witty lines that would have won me over alone, but add to it the nature and content of the story and I was pretty much blown away.<br /><br />I will say that emotionally I had to put the book down for a bit. Some friends we know through church lost their seven week old son tragically and I just couldn't read a \\"cancer book\\" while also thinking about what they must be going through.<br /><br />All in all The Fault in Our Stars must be read. There were multiple quotes that I actually noted and want to share with you, but they are all spoilery in nature, so yeah, sorry. You'll just have to read it for yourself. And that you very much must do.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars gets 5 very well-deserved stars from me. Have you read The Fault in Our Stars? What did you think? Let me know!
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Another little guys against the big guys. Serious yet fun. SImilar to other John Grisham stories but alittle bit different.
159413586X|5.0|This is a very good book.  It is not as good as the first one, but it was also hard to put down.  This was also better than the movie.  A lot of interesting details were left out of the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game has amazing graphics the huge monkey was a nice touch  definite better than #1 I'm addicted another awesome game is subway surfers
0439023491|5.0|This is not as good as the first book, but I still couldn't put it down.  It's much better than the movie.  The movie misses a lot of the details.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I do love this game but it has a glitch of winning the gift and you know you did...it announces it with big celebration with word &quot;Gift&quot; wrote on screen.  Then you look to see and it still says you have Zero!!! This has happened THREE times.  Plus i paid for seasons....but you only get one for 4.99....then the others are 10.Bucks....Wow!  Even though I bought the seasons....it has a ton of advertisements....you have to pay even more to have removed!  Game is fun...but leaves you feeling a little ripped off.
B005LAII8K|1.0|It refuses to play. This is the first Bluray out of the many that I have ordered that does not work.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down. It really did not have an ending; just stopped. Can not wait to start the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is just as cool as a real coin dozer machine. If you like dropping quarters into those machines then you will like playing this.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|A solid horror flick, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessors. It was a good continuation of the story, but the \\"scary\\" elements were a bit lacking.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Especially if you use the email on your kindle device. If someone sends you a PDF document without this app you will not be able to open it..
B0098VXHBG|2.0|Could not get past the first 20 minutes. Not only was it uninteresting, but i was also not expecting subtitles. I watch foreign films quite often, but i have to be in the right mind set to read my movie and something has to keep my interest. Neither of these 2 factors were aligned on that day.
0897502027|5.0|I loved my purchase. The condition is great and as stated. No cons, all pros.d Used it for a gift and was very well received.
B00722Y1EK|5.0|Bought this for my nephew that races professionally cross county on motorcycles and he loves it so much that he will forget his helmet before he leaves this laying around. To be able to carry one tool as a back up on his ride is a god send for this kid.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written, good English, very informative on animal behavior, kept me wanting to read more, couldn't put the book down, great story of survival.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I was happily surprised with this cd . Every track in my opinion is well worth listeng to I lived this cd . Would highly recommend it
B0007MWZEK|1.0|My last sweeper broke (the plastic cover when I was cleaning it) and I was anxious to get a new one.  I tried to use this one to pick up hair after giving a haircut, and it just dept spreading the hair around my floor.  So disappointed.  Nothing like my last one.  I would no recommend this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the Hunger Games was more of a teen-type read, but that is definitely not the case.  Can't wait for the other movies!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Was a cute story.  I did get board in parts, so skipped through some of the pages.  I hope he does come back after death, cause he will be a great man.
B0030IG0C6|4.0|If you know some little one who likes unicorns, you can't go wrong with this one. Well made, detailed and perfect for any unicorn enthusiast. My four year old granddaughter loved it. She is a unicorn believer.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|If you're looking for a strong female lead or even a pseudo realistic plot, keep looking. Every female character in this show is a terrible cliche of unstable stupid females.
859037985X|5.0|Lua is a great embeddable programming language with a small memory footprint and powerful yet simple semantics and syntax which is also very fast (lot faster than Perl and Python.). I have been using Lua (and LuaJIT) professionally and for personal projects since 2006. Out of many books 'Programming in Lua' by Roberto is the best language manual about Lua. Reminds me of K&R 'Programming in C'. Very well written, concise, precise and accurate. If you are programming in Lua or interested in Lua in the future this book is MUST HAVE. The third edition covers the recently released Lua-5.2.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is really awesome, I have started reading my bible more and even though it doesn't work everywhere with the internet needing to be connected it is still a sword of God's that he has brought to this new generation. Some comments mentioned that it was inappropriate to share things like what they believe in but I don't think it's right to hide your light just like the bible says not to. Be strong in the faith even if it mean that you share with the world that you are a &quot;Jesus Freak&quot;.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|If you're a blues fan, or a Ben Harper fan, then just stop reading now and make the purchase.  This album is that good.  There's not much else to know.  So buy it, then read the rest of this review:<br /><br />I've been a Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite fan for a long time, and if I ever had a slight bone to pick with Musselwhite it's that his voice can get a little grating after listening to an album all the way through.  I would never say that about Ben Harper though.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I gave this a listen and its Harper singing all the way through.<br /><br />The great thing here is that if you want hard hitting contemporary blues that still channels an electric type muddy waters, you get it.  If you want Ben Harper's soulful singing that can be found on \\"Welcome to this Cruel World\\" or \\"Fight for your Mind,\\" you get that too.  I wasn't sure exactly what to expect but I can't imagine it could get much better than this.  In fact I'd be shocked if another blues/rock album came out this year that I like much more.  I haven't been this happy with a blues album since Gregg Allman's \\"Low Country Blues.\\"  And I freaking love that album.<br /><br />Although I love this whole thing there are definitely some highlights:<br /><br />\\"I'm in, I'm Out, and I'm Gone,\\" Just Brilliant.  Seriously.  Musselwhite's electric sounding harp, channeled with an uncharacteristic Ben Harper singing half as if he's preaching and half as storyteller.  This is hard hitting, and it seems as if they may have channeled a little Wolf on this bad boy.  This is the song that let me know that this album was destined for greatness.<br /><br />\\"I Ride At Dawn,\\" A more contemplative tone that was unexpected, but is excellent. This channels similarities to \\"Power of the Gospel\\" and Ben's slower songs which feature his voice.<br /><br />\\"Get up!,\\" A rhythm section driven song with Musselwhite's harp hitting it hard all the way through.  A very political message and it comes through well.  Harper has always had something to say, and in this case I can't agree more.<br /><br />Everything else on the album is just about as special as these tunes, but there's no use in going through them all, as this is one you'll want to make a complete purchase.  Ben Harper's album's are always of some sort of quality, and this has climbed to near the top of his discography.  I hope that this isn't the only collaboration between these two.  5+ stars....for serious.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I stumbled across this great NPR interview with Musselwhite and Harper today:  (link won't show so you have to google/search for it)<br /><br />Search for: \\"Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite get muddy\\"<br /><br />Worth the listen and sheds some light on Musselwhite's influence on the album, which is a huge part of why this album is so great.ell.

B007BGQFTQ|5.0|It's a great series and I had no problems with the transfer to my kindle. These cute stories filled with lighthearted adventure. I am enjoying them immensely.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the love story in these books and would recommend them to anyone!  If you can get past the first book and all of the porn, I think you will really enjoy the second and third books.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written and kept you guessing. I was reading it while folding laundry and trying to make my kids lunch. Witty and captivating!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second and third books are definitely better than the first as there is a love story to it all.  Absolutely loved book 2 and 3.

B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|First let me say that I'm embarrassed to say that I probably haven't seen Disney's Peter Pan since I saw it as a child in the movie theater (and I'm in my 60s!). But watching this new Bluray version brought back many memories for me. But that's not why you are here to read this review so I'll try to provide more useful info.<br /><br />First, be aware that Amazon often groups ALL reviews of ALL releases of a video together. Hence there are reviews - 389 before this one - going back to 1999 (!) when it came out on VHS! So I'll suggest that if you are using the reviews for Peter Pan that you sort by \\"Newest First\\". You can also sort by \\"Most helpful\\" but look at the date and which version the reviewer is covering.<br /><br />This review is of the new BLURAY Disc. Set. This is the first time that the Disney classic is on Bluray in HD and with a new \\"digital restoration\\" and - honestly - it looks great on my Standard Def TV and should be \\"gorgeous\\" on an HD. That is enough to recommend that those who have earlier version upgrade their copies. But there are other features that MAY convince you too. In fact the extras - old and new - run nearly twice the time of the 77 minute film.  The menus are set up to first offer the NEW Bonuses (more in a minute) and then what are termed the \\"Classic Extras\\" - the ones mentioned in earlier reviews like the Making of.., deleted scenes and songs, and Roy Disney audio commentary.<br /><br />NEW this time is a somewhat interesting documentary \\"Growing Up With Nine Old Men\\" produced by Ted Thomas, the son of Disney animator Fred Thomas - one of the 9 artists who worked for Disney from the 1930s on.  For this 41-minute film, Ted travelled to visit the families of the seven artists who had children. You learn what it was like to have your dad work for Disney. I found it interesting to watch once but it's really no something that children will get too excited about. There is also a NEW Intro to the film by Diana Disney Miller (1:09). Other NEW \\"features\\" - not quite bonuses - are the \\"Disney View\\" option. Because the firm was made in standard format - the screen image is basically square. There are black bars on either side when played on wide screen TVs. The \\"Disney View\\" option puts painted \\"wall paper\\" on either side. Not sure we needed that but it's there. As you will see reading some of the \\"most helpful\\" reviews there is discussion - and explanation that I won't repeat - as to why it is not wide-screen. The last new feature is \\"Disney Intermission\\", this means that when you hit the \\"pause\\" button you get to hear facts about the film. Nice idea but when I hit \\"pause\\" it's usually to answer the phone or go to the bathroom and so I really just want the film to pause. Anyway, that's what \\"Disney Intermission is.<br /><br />Like many of the Blurays I've covered from Disney lately I do find a few annoyances that may or may not bother you. Every time you insert the BD in your player it asks you to choose your language and them proceeds to play the \\"previews\\".  There is a mini-menu at bottom that you can use to \\"Play\\" or \\"go to Menu\\" . If you stopped the film without finishing it, it will ask you if you want to stop where you left off or at beginning. But all of this happens after the language question and the previews. Again, not a \\"deal breaker\\" but time waster, IMHO.<br /><br />So there you have it. If you don't own the film at all and have a BD player, go for the BD version. If you have earlier versions - even with the bonuses and, again, have a BD and HD TV, and truly love the film (don't we all?)then, again, go for it. I love the Mary Martin TV version - and the various stage versions too - and for some of us \\"I'm Flying\\" is the REAL Peter Pan song. But the Tv and play versions are also twice as long as the Disney one. By the way, note all the lyricists and the the artists credits (presented at the beginning, not the end like todays Pixar films) and that there were FOUR Directors. All the effort that went into this 77-minute film are now ready in a beautiful print for generations to come!<br /><br />I hope you found this - somewhat lengthy - review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"hat went into this 77-minute film are now ready in a beautiful print for generations to come!<br /><br />I hope you found this - somewhat lengthy - review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B002UM5BXW|5.0|A marvellous look behind the scenes from the view of a chef who is not afraid to tell it like it is in some of our restaurant kitchens. Whoever has sat in a restaurant kitchen and seen what goes on in there will get a verbal deja vu with no holds barred. The author is an excellent writer who takes on controversial subjects on life and cooking with élan. For any chef to be, or just a lover of good food and cooking should enjoy this book.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I recently got a Kindle Fire HD after already having the regular Kindle for a few years and I forgot to get a case with it!  I went on Amazon and this one was one of the cheaper ones, so I was a little worried at first that it would be subpar.  I'm happy to say the case is sturdy, attractive, and fits my Kindle HD perfectly!<br /><br />It's incredibly easy to install (the Kindle literally clips in in about a second) and it's also easy to get your Kindle out if you need to, BUT it definitely won't fall out accidentally!<br /><br />I don't use the stand feature and I've heard some complaints about this case when using it.  I can't say whether they're true or not because, like I said, it's a feature I don't use.  The majority of the time I'm using my Kindle, I'm sitting down and holding it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this case!  It's cheaper than most of the others, but I don't think they skimp on the quality at all.
B007SGM084|5.0|I stayed up late just to finish it. Literally could not put it down! The story line is captivating and keeps you wanting more. Definitely will read it again!
1400067820|3.0|This is a book with a number of great ideas randomly interspersed with pages and pages of pointless diatribes against everyone and everything the author doesn't like. I guess its kind of like listening to your brilliant grandfather, you get some regular gems but have to put up with a grumpy old man for hours in between. At points he goes on a rants against everything from soy milk (reason not explained) to oranges, which apparently were a nefarious Portuguese engineered food import. The overall picture you get is of a fragile ego that doth protest too much that he's not a fragile ego. I love the ideas, but the author is getting more and more tedious with each book he writes. Recommend, but be prepared to hold your nose while you read.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Some of Donald Fagen's best work, and I thought Morph The Cat was the best since Nightfly, which set the standard. Definitely my Grammy choice. It's nice to still hear great musicianship, songwriting, and the art of the killer solo, in today's music. Funk, Blues, Jazz, Soul and Intellect mixed together by one of our all time great musicians. He's our generation's Duke Ellington.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My kids ages 3 and 6 love this app.  We have the free version and I am tempted to buy the extended version.  My 3 year old is not interested in puzzles but loves this.  It is below my 6 year olds level but he is a train lover and doesn't seem to tire of doing the puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really like the use of current tense in this book. The short matter of fact statements work really well to get you wrapped up in what's going on. Very easy read and I tore through it pretty quickly.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, but ultimately I started to realize in this book (and throughout the rest of the series) that the big, thought-provoking payoffs weren't coming. I guess I'm a bit over the age limit of the target market. Still, you can do a lot worse. Just approach it like watching a popcorn movie: don't think too much.
B004TI5N38|1.0|i only read this book in order to be able to read his next book in this series The Forgotten,

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's worth downloading. I LOVE TAKING care of the horses! I am thinking about getting this app on multiple objects
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is worth the trouble downloading. The graphics and ease of use made the experience worth it. You can also make a couple changes in the settings menu for changing the color, unit of measure and location with precision.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|THIS IS THE BROWSER YOU WANT AND NEED TO HAVE. FASTER THAN DOLPHIN AND THE STOCK ANDRIOD BROWSER. GREAT START PAGES AND EASY BOOKMARKING MAKES GETTING TO YOU SITES FAST AND EASY.<br /> ITS THE ONLY BROWSER I USE NOW.  10 TIMES FASTER THAN DOLPHIN.  TAKES SECONDS,NOT MINUTES TO LOAD PAGES WITH GRAPHICS. BEST BROWSER I HAVE FOUND. I USE A COBY KYROS TABLET 10.2 AND THOUGHT THE SLOW WEBPAGING WAS THE TABLET AND ICS. GOT THIS OPERA BROWSER AND THINGS LOAD AS FAST AS MY DESKTOP.PAST PAGES LOAD INTO &#34;TEMPORARY&#34; PAGES IF YA WANT TO RETURN TO THAT PAGE. SLICK,SLICK,SLICK.  THIS IS THE BROWSER TO USE IF YOU ARE TIRED OF PAGES TO LOAD. RATED 10

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed everything about the book!  It had intrigue, it was suspenseful, danger, Love , sex. One of Grisham's best!<br />You can't go wrong  &#34; The Racketeer &#34; is a great read.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|THE MAPS ARE GREAT ON IT...RADAR,STREETS,CLOUDS,RAIN FALL,TEMPS.<br /> YOU CAN GET DOWN TO 100 FEET WITH THE SATELLITE LOOK.  REAL NICE TO CHECK OUT LAKES,DIRT ROADS ETC. THE APP THAT SITS ON THE SCREEN IS ALWAYS ACCURATE IF YOUR TABLET DIDNT GO TO SLEEP, BUT THEN WAKES UP AND GIVES YOU THE CORRECT TEMP. THIS IS A VERY HANDY APP AND I GET LOCAL TEMPS RIGHT UP TO DATE.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Well this game is fun a little confusing at first as to what to do but easy to play once you get started
B008469DGY|5.0|I DIDNT THINK MUCH OF THIS WHEN I DOWNLOADED IT. BUT AFTER I PLAYED IT 3 TIMES, AND GOT THE HANG OF IT,,ITS A REAL FUN GAME. GET THIS IF YOU LIKE CHALLENGES THAT GO FROM EASY ON UP.GREAT GRAPHICS AND COURSES TO PLAY ON.  FUN APP.  GIVE THIS ONE A TRY. BET YOU CAN USE IT 2 PLAYER ALSO.<br /> GREAT IDEA
B0036EBARO|2.0|Count me with everybody who was disappointed by the new-agey NPR flavor of the previous one; though the time was probably right for a change of direction--and I can't deny they pulled it off--it was an unwelcome trade for not getting another ethereal-techno pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance &agrave; la Black Cherry (or Felt Mountain for preference). Hearing this latest release made me wonder if she's run out of ideas. The first song jumps out like some parody of the Pointer Sisters, and despite her singing voice remaining sharp as ever the bulk of Head First's limply stylized space-pop tracks would not be out of place in the rotation of Flash FM with DJ Toni, played between disposable favorites from the Human League or Wang Chung. Even the (now-obligatory for Alison) slutty industrial entry, \\"Shiny And Warm,\\" is a letdown. Oh well, wait 'til next year I guess. The final track (\\"Voicething\\") is admittedly a cool bonus and charming enough to keep this overall rating on the right side of 2 stars.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|AS FUN AS REAL AIR HOCKEY. THE NEON GLOW ADDS A BIT TO THE GAME..PLAY THE COMPUTER OR PLAY A FRIEND..FAST,ACTION PACED..A GOOD GAME IF YA GOT THE NERVES AND STAMINA
0307341577|5.0|I first read Flynn's Gone Girl, after my cousin insisted I read her copy. I loved it, so I bought this book by the same author. This novel is, like Gone Girl, a mystery-thriller, and it is a page turner. It is an easy read, and I liked that I could just sit back and not have to think very hard while enjoying the story. It is also well-written, however, so just because it was an easy read, it was not dumbed down at all. I am usually a Russian Lit fan, but if you are looking for something that flows quickly and gets you into a story quickly, this book delivers.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|If you want to laugh and cry at the same time; if you want to know you are not the only pathetic loser out there; if your capacity to love is so great, it is your biggest pitfall; this movie is perfect for you!
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|This album is great. I love the lyrics, the guitars, and the emotion it evokes. I am not a John Mayer fan at all, and this is the only album I own of his. It was his stroke of genius, as far as I am concerned.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really wonderful game. I don't know whether the exercise is spatial or logical or what but it is great exercise for my brain.
030771652X|5.0|This is the first book I have read in years that actually made me cry during parts of it.  ( I cant tell you what and when, but you will get there if you read this book)<br /><br />This is an incredible mystery and a beautiful love story between two sisters.  It's also a healing book for a very dysfunctional family.<br /><br />It is complex and riveting.  The author takes her time unravelling the story and whilst it may seem slow to some people, if you enjoy good writing you will savor every word.  I could not put it down.<br /><br />Congratulations this is definitely a Grand first novel.<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />PS I have to add for all the naysayers out there, this is not a John Patterson novel where he gives you 3 page chapters and it is easy to understand.  This is a multi-dimentional REAL NOVEL.  It makes you think, and understand the beauty of her written style.  This book is to be enjoyed like a fine 70 yr old bourbon.  You must take your time with it.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|I appreciated the action and some of the come-back lines. Story and plot rather predictable. Getting rid of the &#34;bad aliens&#34; was at best, average and could have wowed me a bit more. I like who they picked as actors. I likely would have given this 3-1/2 stars if I could, but it is what it is.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Almost like a gigapet! But more life like. Not really into games where I feel the need to get on every day.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bruno Mars. I've been putting off purchasing his music for long enough. Cannot get enough of Young Girls, Locked Out of Heaven. I was pleasantly surprised by 2 or 3 other songs, like Moonshine and Natalie, even When I Was Your Man. The Lazy Song, is just that, but kind of fun to listen to when relaxing and being lazy myself. Bruno ROCKS!
