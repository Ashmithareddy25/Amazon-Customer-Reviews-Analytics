B00B8R1NP0|5.0|The story opens as a killer strikes  - and the chilling reason for his gruesome revenge - one of the victims wasted his time! The reader is then introduced to Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlane - the detectives assigned to solve the seemingly irrational slaying of an innocent woman and her children, and maiming of her husband. As the story unfolds and more murders occur with a similar modus operandi, pressure mounts on Max and Jesse to find the killer before more innocent people die.<br />This book gripped me from beginning to end. It enthralled me for a number of reasons - the hypnotically awful injuries inflicted on the victims (like car-crash TV, I couldn't look away), the dynamic between the cops as seasoned Max adjusts his attitude to rookie Jesse - and perhaps I shouldn't say this - but I felt sympathy for the murderer! If we're honest, who at one time or another, hasn't felt angry with someone for wasting their time? OK, the killer did take things to extremes - but I could appreciate the source of his agitation.<br />For sheer reading enjoyment I have no qualms in rating `Time Killer' a 5 star read.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The second book in the Selection series does not disappoint! I enjoyed this book and the progression of the storyline from the first book. The first book was all about America and her introduction into the Selection and how different things are in the castle. Now she is there and coming into her own as a young woman and seeing the good and bad that comes along with powers in her country. Now she is realizing she may have chance to change things..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read \\"The Shining\\" as a young girl, alone for the first time while my parents were out.  Maybe not the best choice....  In \\"Doctor Sleep,\\" Dan is about the same age I am today.  I felt a little like I was at a class reunion.  It was nice to catch up!<br /><br />At first, I thought I should re-read \\"The Shining\\" before reading this.  I'm glad I didn't.  I think having my memories of Danny's childhood a little dimmed (like those of my own childhood) enhanced the pleasure of reading this story. Reading them together would have diminished the feelings of just how far Dan had come in his journey through life.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I wish they would make more movies for Halo.  This movie is awesome, story line was good and characters were great!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This show really doesn't have any dull moments. 3rd season only got better. Great characters and development of them. Overall this should could just keep going.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book is about a seventeen year old sheltered girl (Sky) who meets an eighteen year old boy (Holder) with a troubled reputation. She struggles with the recent changes in her life, a new school, a new boy...friend, and a smothered past that starts to resurface. The author can form a decent sentence, there is plenty of interaction between the characters and the storyline is smooth and cohesive, but ultimately the romantic emotional connection is just not there. There is definitely a connection felt between Sky and her mom and best friend but not with Holder.<br /><br />This book is very dark in places....so be ware, it's full of overloaded monologues, and the physical connection between the lead characters later in the book is so unrealistic you almost have to ignore it. The past is too damaging to warrant the responses from the lead characters it just doesn't work. They are also high school seniors and the dialogue reads like they are psychologists. I get the high school kids have adult issues to deal with and of course they will feel adult enough to decide on the response to a given situation, but they are still high school kids, they won't know for example how to walk someone through a therapy session. It just comes off corny, there were many eye rolling moments along the way.<br /><br />If the author had added ten years to her characters it may have been more believable and I didn't get a romantic connection between Sky and Holder at all the flirting was flat and the chemistry underwhelming and honestly you didn't really want them to go there because of what was being revealed in the character's pasts.They could have been just friends and the story would have been better, and the ending was wrapped up way to quickly and neatly, anyway that's my opinion for what its worth. I am not inspired to read anymore from this author. Enjoy!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I have been an Alan fan forever and have nearly all his albums. I am not really a bluegrass fan and almost passed on this one. Boy, am I glad I didn't. Yes, he may not have the \\"high lonesome sound\\" of Bill Monroe or Jimmy Martin or Vince Gill, but his voice carries the story.<br /><br />The band is tremendous as others have noted, and they get plenty of time to show their skills. The fact that he wrote most of the songs shows another side of Alan. Some of them seem like they could be old handed-down story songs. I too really like \\"Blue Ridge Mountain Song\\"; so far that is my favorite.<br /><br />I am glad that there is at least one real country singer out there who refuses to give into the pop sound coming out of Nashville today.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I have loved this movie since it was released. I have gotten everyone I know hooked on it. This is really a fun movie with an amazing soundtrack by Danny Elfman. Tim Burton is a genius. So is Danny Elfman.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Yes, there are a lot of apps out there that do this kind of thing, but I've loved using XNView as my Windows image viewer, so I had to try this one out as the free app of the day.<br /><br />First, there are no ads.  Hopefully, it will stay this way, as users a few months ago had ads in the paid version, apparently.<br /><br />It's pretty standard fair: Take a picture, or pick one from your gallery, and add effects.  You can crop, adjust levels, add frames and add other effects to your images all very simply.  It's all done quickly and effectively, with many different choices, and a cool random selection.<br /><br />Permissions are few, and my virus scanner reported nothing amiss.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|You can't help singing along and really enjoying all the performances in this movie. After seeing it once, I had to buy it.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|Ian Richardson is the epitome of malevolence in this series.  Probably one of the best series that the BBC has ever done, and well worth spending the time to watch this masterpiece!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original (I own that DVD also) but this is a fun re-imagining. Johnny Depp is amazing as always.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Riveting!  Kevin Spacey is a tour de force!  I would recommend this to anyone, it is well worth the time invested
B00ARW2XJW|5.0|Fun to play with. My kids love to find out what temp it is outside and on my phone. Wow
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Do they make a DVD with all the deleted scenes included ?<br />When you watch the wide sceen edition and view the deleted scenes  you can see that they really need to be put back in the movie ,it will make it slightly longer but it makes this movie even greater than it is .<br />Can this be none ??
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I think this was the worst movie I have ever seen. I always liked Tom Hanks but I thought he was terrible in this. There were about six story lines and the transitions were cumbersome and disconnected. Some of the story lines, like the one with the Asian girls who had apparently been cloned to work in a restaurant  were ridiculous and not clearly explained as to why any society would do that.  In some scenes, you couldn't even understand what peope were saying because they had \\"made up\\" a new language. It was disturbing and had violent scenes that were just stupid. It was a mess! I didn't read the book and I can only hope that it is better than this.  I would have given it zero stars but was required to at least do one. Such a disappointment!
B000ID1J5E|4.0|Villains, dark humor, flawed heroes...plus a plunging, edge of your seat, run down stage 7 rapids.<br />The camera work and a command performance from Meryl Streep make this a movie you want to see.
B00EM6LRCS|5.0|Everyone played their part well, and even the shortest roles were played to the max!  Very enjoyable movie!  For that hour and fifty nine minutes, its worth every minute of anyone's time!
B0058RCVYS|1.0|Ok. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I will not watch it again. It's bad. One star only.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cool a little all you have to do is run its ok but still like it a little collect bananas New stages.and buy a character. And buy stuff like gadgets that will be bored a little
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is an intriguing concept in a game but also one that really makes you think.  It is hard to put down once you start.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the books I love how they turned how and The battle each person that went through the games had to battle what happen while they were there what they had to survive.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple, fast, colorful.  Great addition to my Kindle Fire HD (which I have throughly enjoyed). This game may seem too simple for adults at first but, keep playing, very relaxing!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I didn't see the ending coming- which is hard to do to me!  I could have done without the Berlin Wall bit. . . .didn't really add anything to the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games it is amazing and it makes me feel like I'm powerful I love it so much
B00139XTG4|5.0|First let me say that I am not smart enough to have adsorbed 60% of this book on the first pass. That being said Im hooked.<br /><br />I will reread this again and hopefully glean a greater grasp each time. What a novel way to look at the world and humbling.
B005CRQ2DK|1.0|It was a very good book also a funny book #not the best book I still think big nate is the best book (:
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My two year-old cousin loves this game. It is the only game she will play it for over ten minutes. I love the game too. I think it is kind of lick Mario. That is why I rated this game five stars
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Good food for thought. But slow start, and confusing with constant switching of characters.  A lot of past mixed with present.  Not my liking.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Lorde's PURE HEROINE is a gem. Not a single song can be called bad, and I don't skip any on the CD. The album has been on repeat for hours. 10/10.
B006RJTEIC|1.0|This dull 70's flick attempts to portray a dystopian future. Hmmm- aside from Farah-Fawcett jiggling in a toga (brief, cameo like appearance), all the alleged action is clich&eacute;d, with stiff, very outdated side effects, and next to no plot. Yes, this crummy society exists, and yes, our hero and heroine (a total dud compared to Farah Fawcett, by the way!) struggle against it, yet no rationale and no causation for the whacko social structure are even minimally developed. A smashing bore! Why would anyone produce such a dumb film? I mean in the 70's, there was sex galore in cinema; the tiny jigglings that go on beneath these always tidy togas certainly offers nothing, especially against the ribald cinematic standard of those deliciously fast and easy years. This film flops, flops, flops...no useful special effects, no chemistry to the romance, no real plot, no deeper meanings or messages. What's left? The cinematography was acceptable.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This hidden object game is easy to play, however, it can be difficult to find the items on even a moderate sized screen like the kindle fire. If I were on my computer, I'd give the game more stars.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The attention to detail make this book a very enjoyable read. I feel as if I've actually visited Yemen. The plot kept my attention to the very end!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The plastic on the inside tore too easy.But besides that it holds up well.The bag in general is good but they need a better kind of plastic on the inside.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is freaking sick I love this game I will play this all the time  But the only problem is that you should make it easier to get glu points
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I chose five stars because I really enjoy this series. Yes I do enjoy period pieces, but it is more than just beautiful costumes and scenery. The acting is superb. The stories are entwined and keep the audience entertained.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I loved it.  Best video game ever. Best video game you'll ever ever get. No game can ever ever get better.
B002C6K7N0|2.0|it came to me cracked and the case was also damaged i plan on sending it back and would not buy from this joke of a seller, i pay good money for my stuff and expect the same when i get it.
076790592X|5.0|Great book! It opens your eyes to so much and you realize some many things about life, love, money, etc. I personally had never read a book for leisure before until my buddy recommended this to me. Anybody with any sort of interest in psychology, human behavior, etc. should definitely look into this insightful read.
B000VKW7AK|4.0|great but really small, comes with 4 CDs and 1 DVD nice to had to the collection but smaller then the peace sells, who's buying box set.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is similar to deer hunter reloaded and there both beast! I would recommend it to anyone that likes hunting
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great and I Recommended this box.  Trains your brain.  This definitely keep you on your toes.  My son loves it as well.
B009LDD22U|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite sitcoms and is quickly moving right up to number 1. So well done in all areas.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Just what I need to read pdf files, hard to work on a kindle but does function with a little patience
B0035LMTZA|3.0|... but I definitely liked seeing Donald Sutherland in a role where he actually got to smile. He doesn't get too many of those these days.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Get passed vector is kinda funny. But we love it when we run into something unexpectedly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great continuation of Danny's story--plausible without straying from the '' Shining'' concept.  I'm already rereading to capture what I might have missed the first time.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I was formerly a professional computer technician and still am a computer power user...That being said, I love this little device.  I purchased it and a usb 3.0 card reader from the same company because my pc, a laptop, only came with a single usb 3.0 port.  the others are all usb 2. these two products have allowed me to increase my work flow to the three terabyte external hard drives I keep and allowed for much smoother operations.  I couldn't be more pleased.  And that was just the products...The customer service is also top notch.  There are so few companies trying to provide great service anymore.  These guys (and gals) really do care!  Everybody says it, but this company actually does it...They have sent emails to me, even before I received the products to assure my satisfaction and encourage my feedback.  How many companies actually do that?  As far as I am concerned, you couldn't possibly go wrong buying from these guys...They actually deserve a six star rating...a perfect ten!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel.  I have always loved the shining and love seeing as Docs  trials and life experiences.  Great book.
1416972242|5.0|came in pretty good condition and i enjoyed reading this whole book series and i highly recommended it to people
1609611543|5.0|I have read it through more than once and keep referring back to it all the time. I have more engery, i've lost weight, cleared up a rash and lowered my cholesterol. Getting off of the prossed food was the best thing I have ever done for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its so addicting and if you dont already have it get it now! THIS GAME IS TOO MUCH FUN! GET IT NOW!!
B007TTFXC0|5.0|Amy does it again. Great mix of beats and tempos. Wonderful voice. Very easy to listen to while on the road.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|A game that works the mind. Like how you have to work with numbers. A game I recommend to all.
031236198X|5.0|The delivery was prompt and the condition was as advertised. Can't ask for more than that, really.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it did exactly what it set out to do: Explain how to initiate change under stressful conditions in parable form. Parables have largely fallen out of style in recent years, so it was a nice change of pace and the info stuck more than it would have if it'd just been presented as a how-to book.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Those of you having difficulties signing in, i know why, and i was in the same situation too. It needs an upgrade..i can show you how :D<br /><br />1. Download \\"File manager\\" at the kindle app store<br /><br />2. Go to WEB and type \\" [...]<br /><br />3. Download it<br /><br />(once you download go to the file manager app and find the app)<br /><br />4. Click the app and install and you are good from there..
B00CQ8U5ZE|4.0|A very good film made even better on Blu Ray. I recomend it highly. The sound and Picture was just fabulous!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book reminded me in many ways of books by Maeve Binchy, an author I love and will miss so much. I liked this book a lot, and never guessed the secret until it was revealed. I like the flawed realistic characters too. I look forward to reading more books by this author!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I listen to it all the time. It helps me be calm. Helps my sleep, especially now with sleep timer! I've enjoyed this app extensively. Even my nephew who hates naps lays right down when I put this on. On my way to upgrade to paid version :-)
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|can't download this on my kindle fire. I don't know why. it would be better if I could play it bout I cant. what's up with that?
B005K8QIS0|5.0|i bought this to  have in my DVD library after seeing it on BBC here in the US ... love love love Kate Atkinson's writing and Jason Isaacs brings Jackson Brody to life
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Over 30 years later, Depeche Mode still delivers the soaring, intense Techno style that fans have expected. The tour supporting the new album was awesome, great spectacle, light show, overwhelmed the senses.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|MOVE WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT HE NEVER TOOK OFF HIS HELMET<br /><br />GOOD THING I KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE FROM STAR TREK MOVIES<br /><br />LOTS OF ACTION, BLOOD & GUTS<br /><br />WASN'T AS GOOD AS 1ST MOVIE &#34;JUDGE DREDD&#34;
B00632HWOG|2.0|I used to really liked getting my e-mail on my kindle.....but since the last update I do not receive mail.  I even lost e-mails from April to the present......very very frustrating .....I will be deleting it, unless it is fixed soon.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Imaginative, richly rendered setting with mystery and intrigue. Both young teens on the brink of adventure and adults with longing for a journey through youthful dreams will enjoy this novel.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Can't wait for next season! There are times you wonder where they are going to take the story line and then you are amazed.
B006DGOV9Q|1.0|Though it looked the same as the battery coming with my phone and battery model is the same as well, it couldn't fit into my phone since the bottom edge is a little bit bigger than the original one.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I've been using it for a while and I really like it.  The up side is that it works across all of my audio player apps, the down side is I forget to turn it on.  I wish it had Tasker integration because with that I could have it fire up and automatically set the configuration for Doggcatcher -- mostly podcasts and spoken word or WinAmp -- mostly music.  I like the controls it gives and the fact I can save a particular group of settings.
B00H83EUQW|3.0|Before I begin, this is a review for the nerdy masses. If you don't understand the relevance of Newtonian physics to a movie about space then just ignore everything I'm about to say. This review is aimed at the nit-picking few, not the general populous. I understand that but the nerd masses must be served too. Also, don't vote the review 'unhelpful' just because you don't know what 'Newtonian' means.<br /><br />OK, so let it be known that I don't do movie summaries, so there's no chance of a spoiler. I also endeavor to keep things short and to the point so here goes...<br /><br />To the positive, this movie has some wonderful moments and great cinematic execution. There are some truly breathtaking scenes that evoke an almost painful level of tension. The trailers do this movie justice and it is just as visually gripping as they would have you believe. There's also a faint thread of deeper meaning along the lines of the frailty of human life, connection to mother Earth, all that usual yadda, yadda. It's there but it's fairly weak.<br /><br />Despite all the great shots though, the movie has a real problem with physics. I realize, of course, that every movie that has to do with space has this problem but it's particularly disappointing in this case because I expected so much more. At times the story disregards just how big the planet is relative to the tiny vehicles we use to travel around it and misses on points of simple Newtonian physics. This is reasonably ignorable for the first half of the movie but eventually it begins to wear on the scientifically minded.<br /><br />In summary, this is either a great movie or a mediocre one. If you're the sort who will go home and look up the cockpit configuration for the Soyuz capsule to compare it to the movie... well, you may be fairly irritated at some of the disregard for reality this movie demonstrates. If you're able to put that sort of thing out of your head though, then you might very well enjoy the action of what's going on. Not really a movie with a ton to say on any deeper level but it does stir up any acrophobic tendencies. In retrospect, worth the $7.50 but to see it in the theatre but I wouldn't be nearly as excited about it as I was. Suspect this will lose quite a bit when it goes to the small screen.oing on.

B009IH0ICG|4.0|I received my chimney starter yesterday and it was damaged.  I contacted Amazon, they were excellent in making arrangements to reship a new one, and sent me a label to return the damaged one.  It is small, compact, and constructed with good materials.  Much better than the large chimney that is impractical for home use with hibachi's and dutch ovens.  Can't wait till my new one arrives to use it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Really nice collection and well presented. It looks like a book where each page is a sleeve with individual DVDs and information about that particular DVD Perfect for any sci-fi movie lover!
B00F52YOPA|5.0|the wife likes to play this game and has fun doing it.  Another good hidden object game to enjoy would highly recommend it
B0018PH3L0|5.0|By far the best of the best of westerns in my life time. Every time it's on tv I can't turn the station. I watch the remaining parts and fall in love with the gang all over again. I wanted the new HD set so my kids can have them some day. My boys are Lonesome Dove Junkies already.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have used skycaddie on my golf cart since 2005 which I really enjoyed and depended on.  My third skycaddie finally died, I have been through 3 which sky caddie replaced at a charge. Many of my friends had switched from Skycaddie to hand held rangefinders and I decided to try it out. The Bushnell that I got from Amazon is great, I finally learned how to hold it steady. Accuracy to the green/pin is unbelievable...It is also much cheaper than paying $30-50 per year to skycaddie for the use of my personal GPS, I would recommend it to any golfer...
B00CT6EJEG|5.0|This US release via Warner Bros provides a stronger print than the rather fragile UK print from Miramax.  All of the same extras so a worthwhile upgrade/double dip!  Highly recommended.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Alex is a tough read, meaning that nasty things happen to people. But even with this, this book is terrific. A real page turner. Language is wonderful, suspense intriguing, always curious about where the story is going, great characters and a really great detective story. It was a real pleasure to read a \\"foreign\\" detective story that really had you guessing.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|The odds of running into wrong people at the right time or running into the right people at the wrong time especially on an international basis requires a long stretch of the imagination.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I was good. I just expected more after season 1, this 2nd season seemed like a downgrade (in terms of the characters and their abilities and being able to think ahead based on season 1) up until the last two episode. But overall good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a lover of post apocalyptic fiction, I have read my fair share ranging from young adult fiction series like Divergent, Hunger Games, Legend, and The Maze Runner to adult classics like Swan Song and The Stand. I have lately been venturing into the ebook authors and Kindle series like Life As We Knew It and the Final Dawn Series. I was in desperate need of something new to read and I kept seeing the great reviews about Wool. Not wanting to read too much of the reviews in fear of spoilers, I went in blind and purchased Wool Omnibus Edition one night. Well, what I thought was going to be another short night of reading before bed turned into forcing myself to put my Kindle Fire down at 0400 and getting to sleep as I had to be up for work at 0630. Needless to say, that first night I had a very vivid dream of living in one of the Silos I had just read about.<br /><br />Mr Howey has managed to not only create a completely original tale, but he also managed to make me care about these characters. Every character seemed so real. I kept reading and reading just wanting to discover more and more about this world. What I really liked about what Mr Howey has done was that he gives the reader many many questions, but yet, he doesn't make the reader wait for answers and drag out a series. By the time I had finished Wool, yes I had some of my questions answered to my satisfaction, but I found myself not wanting some of my other questions answered so soon. I immediately downloaded the sequel/prequel Shift Omnibus. Again, I'd like to that Mr Howey for more recent late nights!<br /><br />Funny side note, I am an oncology nurse and while I was admnistering a patient's chemotherapy the other day I noticed he had a Kindle and we got to talking. I raved about Wool and he immediately downloaded it and started reading. He was so engrossed in it that he said it made his 6 hour chemo infusion \\"fly by\\".  I even got one of our oncologists reading it also.<br /><br />Keep up the great work MrHowey! I read that the film rights were purchased and I can only hope and pray your masterpiece can survive the Hollywood treatment but you can count on me being there for the midnight release!
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|Not as good has some of his other books, but still really good.  He can make ANYTHING interesting. This is no exception.  It's just not as funny has his earlier works.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|No bells or whistles but good for a quick check of temp, cloud conditions or not and the future forecast.
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|I was curious to see what it did. I have much better control and more options in Photoshop. I didn't see anything here that I can't do there and do it better. But I've been working in Photoshop daily for the past 15 years, so I guess if this is all you need, it's OK. Just not a big thrill for me. I'll clear it off, I need the room in my Kindle. I didn't see any ads.

B004DM1ZQY|1.0|It was a fairly good game at lower levels.  But at Level 4 it was obvious that the program started cheating.  How else could it always manage to roll just the right numbers to knock your pieces off the board, block your pieces from getting back on.  I have played backgammon for 30+ years so I know the odds of getting just the right roll.  I was so feed up with the game I uninstalled it within a week of getting it.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This second installment of Star Trek set in the new reality does not disappoint. In this universe all the characters of the original series can be reintroduced without violating the time-line of that series. The first two movies have not disappointed.
B000VXJMYG|4.0|I first heard Supertramp during a summer vacation traveling between Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  The songs &#34;Goodbye Stranger&#34; and &#34;The Logical Song&#34; were staples on the Top 40 radio stations during that time, and they became the soundtrack to that particular summer of mine.  When I got home I raced out and purchased a copy of &#34;Breakfast in America.&#34;  The album has always held a fond place in my heart, so I am admittedly biased on my review of it.  But I also honestly believe it to be a great album.<br /><br />The compositions here are tight and well produced.  Remember, this was before computers replaced great musicianship.  Each track yields a delight in some way.  If there was any in-fighting, as was reported years later, it wasn't evident in the overall result.  If I have any complaint at all, it would be -- looking back now with my current musical sensibilities -- that there is far too much keyboard work on the album for my personal preference.  But what can one expect when both lead songwriters were skilled keyboard players?  Regardless, this recording was the group's breakthrough album that ushered in their popularity while simultaneously lamenting their inevitable stardom.  Tracks like &#34;Gone Hollywood,&#34; &#34;Take The Long way Home,&#34; and &#34;Child of Vision,&#34; for example, spoke about the very thing they craved and despised at the same time.<br /><br />On a positive note, the packaging was clever and the marketing was spot-on.  The cover, clearly designed to represent New York City, shows that even then NYC was the place to conquer for bands from overseas.  I still own the original album and downloaded this remastered version as an MP3 -- something none of us could have envisioned in 1979.  It didn't come with a digital booklet, but that's fine.  I don't need one.<br /><br />If I had to categorize the music on this album, as to the period in which it was released, I would say, 'File somewhere between Yes and Genesis.'  And definitely recommended.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|A campy, over-the top, tale of the legendary monster hunter, is great fun to watch. The only monster of old missing from this tale is the Mummy. I would liked to have seen a sequel.
1401322425|5.0|Best cookbook ever. Inspired me to start gardening. Changed my cooking philosophy. I now cook a lot with fresh herbs. There isn't one recipe I tried in this book that I didn't like. I have a few recipes that I always cook. I have had this book for years, and just made his Ketchup recipe, using tomatoes that I grew. Incredible!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This has to be one of the best series.  It was action packed and intense.  Tony is telling you how he got to present day which happens to be impacted by a maniac who decides he wants to control both side of terrorist threat. It is a little bit long winded but well worth watch.  It was an AWESOME movie.
0756404746|4.0|I got this book one or two Christmases ago and somehow it wound up getting shifted down in my reading list. I've been reading a ton ever since I started working at my new job though and I was in the mood for a bit of fantasy. The fact that I know Patrick Rothfuss plays Dungeons and Dragons also made me eager to read his work.<br /><br />I loved The Name of the Wing from cover to cover. You have to love all of the new elements that Rothfuss blends into a story with some of the favorite fantasy standbys. Sorcery, swordplay, and monsters meet stories, stage, and song in a wondrous tale that is a wonder to behold.<br /><br />There are two major weaknesses to this story however. Kvothe is supremely arrogant, and to be fair his abilities warrant a bit of smugness. He's able to pick things up easily and excels at them with minimal effort. It didn't put me off of the character because I think he puts out this arrogant persona when he's really very lonely and frightened. He's an amazing actor and the arrogant Kvothe is his greatest role.<br /><br />The second weakness is that the way the story is written changes early on and it can be a bit jarring. Without giving anything away we're introduced to one story which transforms into another with a few short chapters. It's pretty surprising.<br /><br />Ultimately this is our first taste of Kvothe's story and there are two to go, I've ordered A Wise Man's Fear  and I can't wait to read.

B009GFEOY8|1.0|I wish I'd read the most recent review before ordering.  I, too, received expired film.  I would strongly recommend not ordering this product via Amazon.  I don't know if the issue is with Amazon's distribution center or Impossible Project, but no one should be paying that price for a pack of film when it's expired and not advertised as such.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Not your typical Reacher novel but it builds suspense, keeps you guessing, and has an explosive end. I wouldn't start with this book but of you're a longtime fan don't skip over this one because of negative reviews.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|The first time I heard the album I wasn't feeling it until it got to wrecking ball. Listened to it a second time and I liked it much better. By the third listen I'm in love with this album. My favorites are we can't stop, sms (bangerz), wrecking ball, get it right, drive, maybe you're right and someone else. Everything else is good too but those songs stood out more, I'm actually surprised I like this album. I was expecting to hate this album.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|As a Fibromyalgia Health Coach, I was particularly interested in how mindsets affect my clients. This was a great book for showing me how I can help my clients better - what questions to ask, the kind of praise that helps and hurts, and much more.<br /><br />A note of caution... as you start the book it can be a little frustrating because everything is laid out in black or white. Growth mindset or fixed mindset.<br /><br />Part way into the book, the author explains that she's done this to simplify things, but that we all are a mixture of both mindsets. I wish this statement had come earlier in the book. My husband and I spent many hours discussing why the black/white world just wasn't working for us. When we got to this statement, we were able to relax and listen better. =)
B00DT55OGS|4.0|Fans of Belle and Sebastian and Stuart Murdoch will find plenty to like on their new compilation album, and quite a bit to skip. There are B-side recordings to earlier hits that are as good or better than the original A-side releases. But there are also needless remixes, suggesting that B&S was determined to fill up the time allotted on a disc. Still, this album is worth it for the gems, particularly &#34;Love on the March,&#34; &#34;I Took a Long Hard Look,&#34; &#34;Long Black Scarf,&#34; &#34;Travellin' Light,&#34; &#34;Passion Fruit,&#34; and &#34;Blue Eyes of a Millionaire.&#34; B&S are at their best when they synthesize and blend genres of rock, seamlessly and always with a light touch, combined with their sparkling and often razor sharp lyrics. &#34;Love on the March&#34; is a catchy samba as only B&S could imagine it. In other tracks, you'll hear echoes of Paul Simon, They Might Be Giants, and even a Telstar-era instrumental. All in a good way. So, ditch the remixes, but, otherwise, enjoy the ride. Literally -- this is a great album to drive to!
B008Y212PI|5.0|A wonderful way to keep your mind sharp. Try it; you'll become addicted. These are more fun than sudoku and crossword puzzles.
0743298039|5.0|This is not a pretty story.  In fact, it turns the fairy tales and happy endings a reader might expect upside down.  Still, it is a beautiful story, woven with the threads of love, longing and belonging.  The characters, from Miss Winter and Margaret Lea all the way to the neighborhood Doctor’s wife and a new mother hanging laundry, are fully human, with their own faults and strengths.<br /><br />There are many parts of this book where the reader will scratch his or her head and wonder if they missed something.  They will want to reach out, wring the author’s neck and yell, “Tell me what is going on!”  However, for those who can be patient and get through the beginnings, middles and ends, there will be a great reward.<br /><br />If I had to choose one word to describe this book, it would Brontësque, or Brontëan (I don’t think either are actually words, but I mean to say that it is very much in the style of the Brontë’s).  I have always loved the work of the Brontë sisters—I actually spent a summer during my college years studying the Brontë’s in England.  It is no surprise that one the Brontë classics, Jane Eyre, plays a central role in this novel (What is surprising was my discovery that Setterfield was little more than a casual fan of the Brontë sisters).  In describing this to others, I used the classic Grey’s Anatomy term, “dark and twisty.”  This is not a book of sunshine and rainbows, but of secrets and shadows.<br /><br />While I cannot recommend this book enough to others, I recognize that this is not a book for everyone.  It is a book only for readers who have the patience and fortitude for such a book.  It is a book only for readers who are worthy of it.

B00F54NGSE|5.0|Some of the stars include Mickey Rourke, Danny Trejo, Anthony Michael Hall & a number of folks you've likely never heard of tell a familiar tale of outlaws and their evil plans on the good citizens trying to build a new life.  A bucolic town in the hills of Colorado spark a debate over mineral rights that engulf all of it's citizens & an outlaw gang set on liberating the booty for their own purposes.  Trejo is betrayed by those closest to him and the Unholy of the Underworld cuts him a deal to settle the score, but like any form of gambling there's a high chance of the house fleecing you on the best deal!  A good blend of drama, action, western & horror genres.

B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|A paranoid, over the top cautionary tale for our times. Excellent read. For some reason, the writing reminds me a little of Tom Wolfe. Anyway, the supreme irony came at the very end. I was reading on my Kindle, tapped past the last page of the book, and a new page popped up. On the left there was a box with five blank stars that said \\"rate this book,\\" and next to that another box had a button that said \\"share.\\" OK, then.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased this because it's the cheapest media streamer on the market and if you need to stream Youtube or Netflix to your TV, this is your streamer.  However, it's streaming services are very limited.  There is no Amazon Instant Video support which is very disappointing and no screen mirroring from your phone.<br /><br />If you can still get this with the free Netflix, get it.  If not, then  hold off for version 2 or some more software upgrades.

B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Knew it did poorly at box office but SYFY and curious. What is this?? Could be the worst excuse for a movie I have seen in a long, long time. What is wrong with it?? Everything. Poor script, plot. Acting?? What acting?? Special effects now and again but so much yawn in between. Terrible waste of the Will Smith and his son. Forget this one. If I could have given 0 stars, would have. Do \\"Iron Man 3\\" instead.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It feels like I have gone through a lot f car chargers and this is by far the best on I have found. It has an incredible amount of power at 3.6A/18W, you can't put out that much power in a package this size without a good design. It all comes down to efficiency. I have used other name brand chargers that were rated for 2.1A and while they would put that out they would overheat and start cycling power on and off after only a few minutes of changing my ipad. Anker has done an outstanding job making a high efficiency product here. When charging my iPhone at 1A is barely gets warm. I have confirmed I can pull the full 3.6A for hours on end and it continues to work flawlessly.<br /><br />Another big gripe I have with almost all car chargers I have used is when in use they create Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) The result of which is my radio stations turn to static and I am forced to choose between listening to my favorite radio station or charging my phone. Products with the CE and FCC marks are claiming to not cause this problem but sadly in my experience most are lying about being compliant. Imagine my pleasure in finding that this Anker product did not degrade my radio reception in the least. This to me along with the power efficiency is a sigh that Anker has an outstanding quality product here and it inspires confidence in long term reliability and safety for my precious mobile devices it will be powering.

B000SEH80I|5.0|I found myself in an extremely difficult position with a parent were I was letting the relationship affect my day to day life severely. I couldn't afford therapy but I knew I needed to do something to change the way I was thinking. This book has helped me in many ways. I have a loving but controlling mother that I have been seriously trying to break ties from for the better part of the year. This book not only helped me understand her confusing behavior, but my role in the relationship as well. I have been able to not take everything she does so personally. Not only have I been able to better control how I react to the actions of my parent, but I have been more aware of how I let everyone else in my life affect me as well. It was easy to read and easy to understand. I would have thought that the majority of this book wouldn't apply to me but I have been able to take bits and pieces from each section and each type of toxic parent and apply it to some relationship or other in my life. I am very glad to have read this book. Just this alone has been enough for me to persevere through and not need to spend money I don't have on therapy. Of course, it didn't fix my relationship but it did help me change the way I perceive things greatly.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|First of all, here's how I'd rank the tracks (UPDATED AND RE-ORDERED 10/25/13):<br /><br />- All Ends Well<br />- Cry of Achilles<br />- The Uninvited<br />- Addicted to Pain<br />- Fortress<br />- Bleed it Dry<br />- Calm the Fire<br />- Outright<br />- Cry a River<br />- Farther than the Sun<br />- Waters Rising<br />- Peace is Broken<br />- Lover<br /><br />The album is pretty strong and consistent, but is melodically their worst yet lyrically perhaps their strongest (next to Blackbird). While I don't think their intent was to go for melodies like they have phased from less and less per new album, it felt a little bit like they thought of the coolest guitar riffs and sections first and then said: \\"Okay, let's put some vocals in with these.\\" Not that the vocals beside them are bad, but I wish that they would then go back and say, \\"Okay, now the instrumentals could match with these sections a little bit more.\\" I think that last part was missing.<br /><br />The obvious included influence this time is by Mark Tremonti. His name could be as big or bigger than Myles Kennedy (except overseas since he's toured with Slash), and as much spotlight as he deserves, I think the album went its direction because he maybe deserves to have a little more \\"fun\\" with the band. He tears, shreds, and even soars on vocals at times (takes the lead in Waters Rising, in fact). This decision is a \\"make or break\\" kind, because if somebody is solely a fan of the first album, they absolutely won't be a fan of this album; yet at the same time, people who dismissed Alter Bridge previously as \\"Creed with a new singer\\" absolutely must give this album a listen! It's just not the same kind of AB as they started out, which is fine. In fact, they're one of the more recent bands to do the exact opposite of selling out. I applaud them for that.<br /><br />Some of the songs seem \\"messy,\\" but in a good way and I'll explain. First of all, every one of these songs would be great in concert. They just have that feel to them, since they're loud, hardcore, wild, and all over the place. Many of their longer songs on this album don't follow the general structure of songwriting though. Instead, they feel more like movies: separated into three acts. Listen to Cry of Achilles, Fortress, Calm the Fire, Bleed it Dry, Lover, and Waters Rising. There's some flow here and there, but there are times where you literally could start a song, listen to it for a bit, walk out of the room and take a whiz, then return and wonder if it's the same song or not. They vary so much and separate in almost random places or random tones that you couldn't really convince yourself one way or the other.<br /><br />Continuing on this thought, as awesome as the solos and riffs are, they aren't quite as \\"epic\\" as they could be. My favorite solos remain to be from Blackbird, Open Your Eyes, Rise Today, Down to My Last, and Buried Alive... where they just mold with the song so perfectly. It's not about being the fastest solo, the craziest solo, or the longest solo. It's about being the most memorable. I can hear every note in my head, match it wonderfully and progressively almost as to expect what's to come, and it enhances the rest of the song rather than just making the song better because that part is included.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about Alter Bridge, when I truly sat back and looked at every song and heard it in my head, was that they do have one flaw: they don't have very good bridges in their songs. Yeah, some are okay, but like the \\"messy\\" thing I was talking about before, they deviate so much from the rest of the song or totally fail to match up, that whether or not they sound good it throws off the consistency factor. The same goes for this album too. I would argue that Fortress, Watch Over You, Broken Wings, and Blackbird feature their best bridges, and songs that don't feature any bridges tend to do fine with their solos, but I just finally realized this.<br /><br />(new edit) I regret what I said about Calm the Fire's intro and Fortress's outro before. Calm the Fire totally grew on me, especially after I read the lyrics like as a poem and then listened to the song. Fortress shouldn't be too broken up, though. Just have the \\"outro\\" start immediately after the solo instead of waiting a few seconds.<br /><br />Great album in general, and this one is easy to listen to in the car when you put it on shuffle. No song really disappoints, and the other cool thing is that it can start up and you'll kind of be lost in remembering which song it is... the intros are all so unique I know, but they're uniquely unique in that they're hard to pick out, which is kind of cool. I'm always thrown in for a loop like: \\"Hmm, as many times as I've heard this song, some parts still feel so new to me.\\" This is kind of why I like that messy style that I was referring to. Anyway, what might have sounded like negatives in this small review was more of Fortress finally opening up what I'm able to dissect about the band, four albums into what I hope to be an everlasting discography.<br /><br />I heart Alter Bridge!t what I said about Calm the Fire's intro and Fortress's outro before.

I absolutely loved the book. To anyone who thinks they are going to be bawling their eyes out, it's actually quite funny, I laughed a couple of times. The ending is what leaves a mark though. Be prepared.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I listen to music on my Kindle quite a lot and this equalizer really does produce significant results.  Highly recommend.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher has made in my opinion some of her best music with the past 3 albums (Believe, Living Proof, and of course this one). Woman's World is one of the catchiest songs in the world and is to become a Cher classic. This album is great and hearing these songs live is something to look forward to.
B0096U6TNC|5.0|I've never been much of a music reviewer, so I will just say that I really like this album.  I purchased it based on one track I had heard on web radio and find that the entire album is most satisfying.  Best to listen to the samples first.  I found the album well balanced and nicely produced.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have had kik for a little while and now when i log on it takes for ever and then says error while sharing so i waited a while  then logged on again and the error message pops up again they really need to fix this now i advise u not to get this app unless u like waiting for a long tim

B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I fell in love the first time I saw this show. It will always get a high rating from me. Last season I got a little bored with some episodes because they were moving a bit too slow. I became interested again when things picked up.I am hoping this season blows up...only 2days to go...can't wait...got a bet going on who will not survive...Oh yeah and my man Darryl is the sexiest redneck in creation lol...

B00BAXFAOW|3.0|He's still my favorite author! This one was hard to follow and his normally brilliant and clear perspective seem to get a bit caught up in the details of the characters stories.  Some of the chapters were riveting, others were so obtuse in content, I had a hard time waiting to figure out the point. Overall I would never miss a new Gladwell book, but this wasn't one of his stronger works.
0399226907|5.0|This is a great book for learning counting, vocabulary, and a bit of science in a very fun and colorful way. One of my grandson's favorites.
1476734941|5.0|I saw Michael Mosley's program on PBS in April '13 and thought it was very interesting and doable. Bought the book to get more details and ideas for meals. The book was very helpful, informative and easy to read and understand. Oh, and it works great, I've lost 40 pounds in 5 months.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christina Baker Kline, gives Molly and Vivian life, as she weaves a tale of hardship of over ninety years. The Orphan Train is a must for every child who lives in our past and future, to read! I so love this book and hated for it to end.
B001MTENOC|4.0|Reading this material Michael has chosen to share feels like a gift, the gift of expanding all there is to consider possible and perhaps a truthful new reality which brings me a greater understanding of the how and why we exist, a lifetime question. Considering the ideas fundamental faith suggests just seemed too narrow in my view, while incarnation made more sense when I first was introduced to the idea in my youth, yet many people around me did not give this idea much credence, so it has been a more lonesome yet curious journey to somehow 'know' there is so much more to this life. I live every day with chronic spine and nerve pain, often distracting me from the things I love to do, yet in spite of this fact I stubbornly push past it ever grateful to have my life, my family and friends, a loving husband, children and grandchild. With Michael's information covering the possibility of our souls re incarnating in clusters it gives me solace to know I am learning and growing, and not just suffering. Grateful thanks for this my friend!!! I would and have already recommended this book to folks in my life, to give them a clearer understanding, help life make more sense. Glory Wilkinson
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|They did great job with this series.  You felt like you were living in the Roman days. Their attitudes towards death and live and slavery.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|Love every single minute of every single one of these movies! My only wish is that there could have been more of them.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|What can I say - it was Season Two for the Homeland Series.  It is a great series and for me it was nice to have it available on DVD so that I could watch it when I had the time to enjoy it.  It is also much less expensive than the subscription in my area to Showtime.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This the first  novels by Neal Stephenson that I have read but not the last!  He mixes math and history together to keep a wide ranging group readers enthralled.  I highly recommend this book for its entertaining story line and quality of the writing.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|I enjoy the movies of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.  Fans of the two Brits will enjoy this very much.
B00A7ZX37A|4.0|This is a very catchy album with lots of catchy tunes and beats. She stays true to her Caribbean roots.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Perhaps it was my fault that I did not inform myself a bit more about the features of Chromecast before purchase, I needed a affordable media player that will primarily cast media stored on my HDD.  Besides, I looked for media player that would cast streaming video such as live sports events onto a TV screen.  Unfortunately, for both of my expectations, Chormecast did not deliver.  When casting from the above mentioned sources, the connection between Chromecast and internet often breaks and it is impossible to have a minute of stream and cast onto the TV without interruption.  I tested it on Youtube and this thing works fine, but for now, in my opinion this is not enough and it is not worth the hype that this gadget received.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George R.R. Martin never disappoints. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It did take me longer to read than the others, but that's mainly because the characters in this one were not some of my favorites. But I guess you have to build up the plot somehow right? Good job George, can't wait to read the next one.
B000005HFH|4.0|How can you go wrong with a collection of Chet Baker tunes.  The only complaint I have is, starting the collection off with a ballad when an up tempo song would have been the way to go.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A subject never treated in film before-- a sex surrogate for a paralyzed man who wants to experience sex before he dies of MS. It is a highly sensitive, erotic, moving and funny film, wonderfully acted.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I'm just starting out with recording music professionally, so this is the first Audio Interface I've bought. I did a lot of research before buying a audio interface and after a few weeks of looking i decided to go with this one because a friend suggested it(it's what he started off with). I thank my friend because i couldn't be more pleased with this product. I use it in my home studio, and it fits perfectly on my desk. It's a great piece of equipment. It is simple but It's just what I needed for a great price. I'm very satisfied that I chose Focusrite!
B0031RS3K8|4.0|Opinion: If I Stay is a story that goes straight to the heart. Through Mia, the first person narrator, we observe by first hand all the decisions and actions that she has to take in this decisive moment of her life. Through her memories we get to know how was her life before the accident, her family, her boyfriend and her music passion.  I highly recommend this book for all the music lovers, either rock or classical....Music is what first joined Adam and Mia, is also the core of her family and a key element in her life.<br />Mia´s story is an example of how hard life is, of its injustices and twist of fate. It has the perfect ingredients to bring readers to tears (I include myself here) and leave them with the intrigue of what will happen.<br />I highly recommend If I Stay, it is not the typical story with a predictable end. It will keep you stuck to its pages till the end, and after it you will still think of it, that´s what good books do =)<br /><br />MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER: Teddy is Mia´s little brother, he is a very advanced and hustler child for his age. I love the character because he is just adorable and from the very beginning he brings a smile to the reader.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to cook and there are so many great recipes and people to share with. There is also so much info about everything
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER: Lena is my favorite character, because she is one of the few heroes / protagonists that I do not hate (I have a serious problem against the main girl protagonist of the books, mainly because they end up with the guy, and I do not xD). Lena´s  development  throughout the book is amazing, the author has done a very good job with the character's evolution and represents her feelings. She´s a character that you feel easily identified with.<br /><br />Opinion: The first time I read it three years ago, I fell in love with the book. It was my first dystopia and I must say I loved it, not only the story, also the characters, the fluid narrative and the idea of ​​living in a world without love. The characters development throughout the story is very well depicted and the story is so well structured that you really believe that there may be a future like that the author raises.<br />It's a series that I highly recommend and it is also going to  be on  television.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|When I saw a little wet-nosed girl intimidating professional CIA men and even Navy SEALs into doing her bidding, I concluded that a feminist was telling those lies.  Then I noticed the female director's name at the end.  Then I looked up the female director and her feminist agenda was made plain in her bio.  Hollywood is no longer about entertainment.  It's about left-wing propaganda and lies.  And you are paying those liars to lie to your face.
B0065GC0PG|3.0|Opinion:  In Cinder we get into a future where Cinderella´s tale comes to life through our protagonist, Cinder, a cyborg who portraits the modern Cinderella.  In this dystopia we find a prince, stepsisters, a wicked stepmother, faithful companions, loyal friends, war and epidemics.<br /><br />It is a fun novel, the narrative is fluid although,  sometimes the author seems to be stuck in some chapters. Halfway through the novel we can intuit what lies behind Cinder´s mysterious past, but despite of it the novel ending is still unexpected.<br />THE BEST CHARACTER: My favorite character is Iko, an android with a very peculiar personality chip, and  Cinder´s best friend.<br />The character that could have gotten more out is Prince Kaito, I have missed seeing more of that rebellious streak throughout the book, but at the end it does not emerge.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|love using it to watch Netflix and You tube on my large screen tv and control from my iphone.<br />Want to buy one for each TV!
B004H4XDBI|4.0|Opinion: Where She Went is narrated by Adam´s point of view, which I loved because it allowed us to see how he was their separation after Mia´s accident and to see his life as a rock star. The narrative tone is full of anger and depression because he does not like his life, he has failed to move on after Mia´s accident.<br />I liked this book more than If I Stay because I loved Adam from the very beginning and I wanted to discover what happened next. Throughout the whole book I was glued to the book wanting to know how it would end because sometimes it seemed that everything was going well and others that everything was going to end badly. The narrative style alternates the present time with Adam´s memories, as the author did in the first book.<br />Music is still vital in Where She Went, now we see the succeed of Adam´s rock band, The Shooting Stars and also Mia´s successful career as a classical soloist.<br /><br />MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER: Undoubtedly is Adam.  He is perfect but he is not this kind of characters that  seem impossible to be real.  Adam is perfect because he could be any guy (except that he is a rock star), he is such a close character that sometimes you forget he is just a book character. And his feeling for Mia and his vulnerability stole my heart.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|so far I like this app. ive only been playing it for about 10minutes lol. its addicting. the only thing that sucks is that its a little slow on my kindle it may work better on a phone or pad. also I don't know how to switch to the different levels yet haha.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A treasure! Because if this book doesn't make you treasure your time, then I don't know what will.<br /><br />A story that starts out poking only at your curiosity,  gathers pace with time and then becomes a page-turner once you realize its a timeless classic!<br /><br />A must read for every, well, human being.
140006922X|5.0|I'll have to admit that I bought the book because of the obtuse and bigoted FOX News interview of the author. I wanted to see what had the religious right up in arms now.  &#34;Zealot&#34; is a carefully researched and documented look at Jesus of Nazareth in his own historical setting, by a professional comparative religious teacher with impeccable educational credentials and reputation.  It appreciates who Jesus was and helps explain some of the dynamics that led to his execution for &#34;treason&#34; against the Roman Empire with the help of the Jewish religious establishment, whose power he undermined and threatened.  Aslan also attempts to show how the Church, once it became the state religion of the dying Roman Empire, toned down and domesticated the radical Jesus.  The book, frankly, made me struggle with some of my own understandings of Jesus and elements in the scriptures that I had glossed over as a clergy entrusted with the preaching task.  I am still digesting some of the book's suggestions and assertions long weeks since reading the book from cover to cover in about three days.  The book does not &#34;destroy&#34; the bible or the authority of Jesus for Christians, but it does push us to a deeper, more realistic understanding of his human situation and ministry.  It does not give easy answers that can translate directly to our times, but it shows his insight and creative means of addressing the injustice of his times and is a challenge for us to do the same in our historic moment.  Whether you end up agreeing or disagreeing with the author, it is a book that will stir your own thinking.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app that helps anyone who is running out of storage clear it up. It doesn't take up a lot of space and will show you where you are storing the most data. Highly recommend.

B00DU74U74|5.0|My wife and I saw the movie last night on VUDU. We are much older and have seen too many movies to count... we enjoyed the youthfulness of the film. No, we did not read the book. In relation to the reviewer who complains about Saoirse Ronan character or directorship of Niccol's to have Melanie and the Wanderer talk to each other, how else were they supposed to explain having two minds in one body? It was about what she was thinking, the character's thoughts? There would be too many cuts to Melanie or Wanderer if \\"acted out\\" as the reviewer proposes... and probably a bit nauseating. All in all, the intended audience would need to realize, yes, it's from Stephanie Meyer, an extremely talented and well loved author among who? Yes, the teenage population. This is one for the kids, but surely was pleasant to watch. A great story about the coming of two races akin to a possible 'first contact' in Star Trek as in a possible scenario how we would interact. It was well acted, the music is terrific, cinematography is pleasant, the meaning of the story was well represented.. love, humanity wins out. I get the whole dialogue thing and that the movie is not perfect. But terrible? Not in the very least. Aside from Rotten Tomatoes, which there is a movement for paying off or gifting critics, but anyway, check most other review locations, Netflix (4.25/5), iTunes (4/5), Amazon (3.5/5), VUDU (3.7/5), IMDB (5.7/10)... even on Rotten Tomatoes you get a 51% audience approval as of this date. Clearly, \\"The Host\\" is well liked by \\"normal\\" people and over half and sometimes a very high approval such as in iTunes, Netflix. All of the Twilight series is a \\"rotten\\" tomato, but with a high audience approval. So, it's not perfect, but it apparently resonates with most people, the majority. Movies that are this pace, lose out on most nowadays and that's strange. It's a great \\"teenage\\" film. Deal with it. If you want my vote for the worst dialogue, look at JJ Abrams new Star Trek: Into Darknessand the other ST:XI. Those both had the worst one-liners, high school dialogue, \\"I've gotta be cool\\" crap around.
B004XGN8W4|2.0|Pretty decent package for the most part. Well built but not well implemented.  The screen is going to be my biggest complaint!  It's glossy.  ITS GLOSSY!  It reflects everything, EVERYTHING.  Might as well play with a blanket over your head and save the frustration.  Also, it does not stay open at any angle, not adjustable!  You open it and have to prop it open with items you have laying around.  Cool idea but I gave mine to my nephew.  He loves it BTW, I will stick to my xbox 360 custom laptop thank you.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|First thing to keep in mind:  This is not a &#34;mega production&#34;.  It was not done to make money.  It was not done for fame.  It was done by fans of Shakespeare as something fun and challenging to do.  It may actually help to watch the &#34;making of&#34; short first to get you in the right mindset.  This is a bunch of friends getting together to do the play.  Joss did all the casting.  It's almost a &#34;pick-up&#34; version of Shakespeare.  Yes, some of the casting isn't the first choice _you_ would have made.  They weren't the &#34;best&#34; that could have been gotten out of all the actors and actresses available.  But these all were friends of Joss, many in roles they had never considered playing.  With that in mind.<br /><br />It was better than almost any other presentation I've ever seen, movie or stage.  The Kenneth Branagh movie was better, but you're talking about two different types of movie here.  Nathan Fillion's Dogberry was a completely different take than all past.  His delivery of the lines were completely straight faced and so reasonable that it actually takes you a second before you realize what he uttered was completely nonsense.  Amy Acker's Beatrice was brought out nuances to the character that are often hidden by traditional deliverance methods that are meant for stage (big and loud).  Sean Maher as Don John is inspired.  If you can believe it, this was his first &#34;bad guy&#34; role.<br /><br />Watch it not as just a new rendition of a classic.  But also as a group of friends doing something they enjoy because they enjoy it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used to have a kik account and i logged off. i tried to log back on but it won't let me<br /><br />it used to work
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|Amazingly bad. No saving grace not even a clever camera angle. Truly a boorish effort that hopefully will not do damage to anyone new to Shakespeare and have them imagine that this shoddy effort is even remotely Shakespearean--they even manage to mangle great lines.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was a really good book. I have been wanting to buy this book for a while. It was one of the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid books I have ever read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I love this book and I love Sheryl Sandberg!  She is truly inspirational and her book is going to define the feminism of our generation.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|This movie is bad. I'm easy to please, but I thought this film was clunky, wooden, poorly acted and directed. They tried VERY hard to shoot, score and edit this film Iike a Bourne movie, but a Bourne movie IT IS NOT. It's more like 'what would happen if the FBI and Interpol went all out to catch some completely inert castoffs of America's Got Talent'? Great cast, some of my favorite actors, terribly wasted here. Skip it.
0385743564|5.0|This isn't the usual Brandon Sanderson book, so many of his fans may not be completely into it. However, I think that the book is excellent. It tricks you into thinking that you've figured out what is going to happen and then it proves you wrong. I have seen two authors capable of writing a a good fantasy book in which the main character has no powers but is against enemies with great powers. The first is Jim Butcher with the initial books in the Codex of Alera series and now Brandon Sanderson has done it with SteelHeart.<br /><br />If I had to describe the book with something that most people are familiar with, I would describe it as Agent's of Shield for adults, in a gritty/dark setting, with a more developed and mature story.<br /><br />I recommend that everyone read this book. You'll be waiting eagerly for the next installation in the series.
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|I grabbed this as the FAOTD for use on a 7&quot; Kindle Fire HD.  For a simple to use phone or tablet app it does its job. If you like to wreck 'good' photos in an Instagram style sort of way (oops, I mean be creative like a lemming) you should be quite pleased with what you can produce.<br /><br />There are cropping options (that you can constrain or not), color effects, BW conversion options, vignetting amount control, some minor slider-operated brightness and contrast controls, a limited selection of textures that can be overlaid on an image, and colored light effects, plus a gallery of borders.<br /><br />Most of the conversion effects offer an opacity slider to control how heavy handed (or not) your effect is applied. This app is not for sophisticated image processing. But for simple, straightforward, retro effects conversions or overlays it does them well.<br /><br />For me, a greater degree of subtle customization of the various effects would justify 5 stars. For instance, changing Hues or Saturation or Luminance sliders in the color overlays or Highlights, Midtones, Shadows sliders to adjust the tonal ranges of BW converted images would be cool and justify an &quot;excellent&quot; (5 star) rating. But we all have different desire levels for what we would like to do with our images.... so hope that helps with a context for my rating.
B00D9PUXQY|3.0|Devildriver use to be the definition of groove metal. They started going down this road, right at PRAY FOR VILLIANS can start to hear on that album that they where going this directon. Most songs i like some i cant stand. Then BEAST came which is horrible for the most part. Now WINTER KILLS another disappointment from one of my favs. Brutal heavy riffs through out sprinkled with small bits of groove here and there. Not the Devildriver i kno and love. No song stood out listening to it all the way through. As a musician, music i listen to has to impress me and this doesnt. If you have to, save yourself some money and get RUTHLESS and APPETITE
B001ENS0BI|5.0|Endless suspense always surprises you. Very creative scenes. Watched multiple sessions at a time every time until all 4 episodes were complete.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was a very well written thriller that had all the pieces presented in such a way that I couldn't figure out what the twist was going to be.  I read a lot and this doesn't happen all that often, so I really enjoyed that.  I read the entire thing in one day (and into the night), which again rarely happens, but this book was just the very definition of a page turner.<br /><br />I initially took off one star because some of the things that happened, or didn't happen, just strained credibility too far.  Mostly the thing with all the missing secret service agents and lack of government investigation, as well as the scene in the restaurant given what we find out later.  However despite these things, the book was just too enjoyable to take off stars.  I'd actually give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.<br /><br />  I borrowed this from amazon prime and definitely will be borrowing the sequel next month.
1933952806|5.0|My first SLR was a Konica which I carried during my first two tours as an infantryman in Vietnam. The Konica was great, but after digital arrived on the scene I purchased a Nikon D40 which was a step up and also a little more difficult for me to operate. Once I became accustomed to the Nikon way of doing things, I felt more competent to move up to a better camera, a D3000. As with the D40, I loved this camera. I saved up enough money to upgrade to a D5100, also a great camera.<br /><br />  I have been using the D5100 for a few years and started taking photography classes at Tri-Community Adult Education in Covina, CA. After again saving for a new camera I purchased a Nikon D7000. Knowing that this was a more professional camera and this fact might require some great amount of tutoring to begin to learn the camera, I purchased _Mastering the Nikon D7000_ by Darrell Young.<br /><br />  It is difficult to express my thanks to Mr. Young. This book is perfect for a non tech, hands on guy like me. The D7000 has about one hundred variations of  setting up each of the six menus. Darrell started sequentially going through and explaining every possible decision one makes and the consequences of making these decisions. Darrell starts with the playback menu and goes through each sub menu. He seems to anticipate my questions when covering new areas. I have found that if I am patient Darrell will answer my questions.<br /><br />  I enjoyed sitting at my dining room table, pen and paper, the camera, and THE BOOK. It was a snap setting up this camera. If I could award 10 stars on a 5 star scale I would. Thank you Darrell Young. By J. Fred Nesmith, Upland, CA

B00EQ30RVY|4.0|Like many others, I didn't believe that STP could or should continue without Scott Weiland.<br /><br />As someone who thoroughly despises Linkin Park, I was horrified to read that a member of that group had been invited to join STP.  Linkin Park sucks so bad that, as an earlier reviewer stated, I don't even care if I spelled it right.<br /><br />I, for one, liked STP's 2010 self-titled album, even though I later found out that the band was already in trouble (again) while recording it.  I thought the songs were solid and Weiland sounded decent, although clearly his voice was deteriorating.<br /><br />However, Weiland's personal demons and general a$$holishness forced the other band members to finally give him the axe early in 2013.  Even though Weiland and STP had split or gone on \\"hiatus\\" a few times previously, this was the first time the DeLeos and Kretz attempted to fire him.  Naturally, lawsuits were delivered to both camps, and it looked like the end for STP.<br /><br />The DeLeos and Kretz decided to soldier on with a new front man anyway.  Enter Chester Bennington.  Unlike previous attempts with new singers, they chose not to change the name of the band.<br /><br />After viewing a few concert performances of the new STP, I thought CB sounded quite a lot like SW circa the Tiny Music era, only not quite as powerful.  It also appeared that CB was trying too hard to act like SW on stage.<br /><br />Anyway....When \\"Out of Time\\" was released, I was very impressed.  The band sounded fresh and energized, and CB gave the song and the band a different twist.  I really liked the song.<br /><br />Fast forward to the release of High Rise.  I resolved to buy it without hearing any of the other songs.  And I am glad that I did.  I regret that this is only an EP (it's too short).  There is no need to do a song-by-song review.  They are all great.  And I forgive CB for being a part of that garbage group LP (even though he is still recording with them).  You rule, Chester (with STP, anyway).<br /><br />Hopefully, Bennington is much more stable than Weiland and STP can continue making new music for many years.  They will never again sound as they did on Core or Purple.  And that's fine with me.  They are one of the few dependable acts left in rock music.  Those \\"fans\\" who can't accept that bands evolve over time can go listen to something else.<br /><br />I only gave High Rise 4 stars because it's too dang short.  Short or not....Buy this EP now!

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Lots of action and suspense and while Captain Kirk is not exactly the old Kirk, he is pretty good and I did enjoy the movie.
B0040X46TE|5.0|Why do people with talent like this young man leave us WAY to soon. God bless you IZ, You will not be forgotten.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I give this one the benefit of 4 stars only because of the humor in it. Otherwise it only gets 1 star for originality. The back and forth between the characters about whether they belong together or not gets quite annoying. But it is funny and I like the married in Vegas part. Happy reading.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book will change your life. The world is infinite if you just believe. It is absolutely incredible. Amazing. I will read it again and again.
B00FSBW2L6|4.0|The Black Eagle Inn is a sweeping, historical tale featuring a believable narrative written in a memoir, or diary style. Each chapter focuses on a single character, though as the story progresses the voices start to overlap. From pre-war Germany to the modern era, the story illuminates life's many chapters...birth, family, love, loss and its wide cast of characters makes it easy to identify someone readers will be eager to follow through the entire book. For me, this was Anna, the unlikely matriarch of the family. I also enjoyed some of the plot turns (which I will not give away here), and characters from the crazy, to the religious, gypsies, poisoners, thieves and the side plot about one man's struggle with homosexuality in a country and time when it was frowned upon. If you like history, or have a German heritage, you'll especially enjoy this book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was very well written.  I really liked the author's style, and I appreciated her character development.  The story was engaging and kept my attention.  Some of the terminology must have been English, as an American I had to look some things up, but it didn't deter from the story in the least.  Heart-wrenching to be sure, but I am so glad I read this book.  I will definitely look for this author again.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|In his new book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, Malcolm Gladwell explores the concept of being at a disadvantage in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. His premise is that weakness is not always what it seems.<br /><br />Gladwell combines stories, history, research and psychology to draw his conclusions.<br /><br />All these tools lead to the same conclusion as the gospel.<br /><br />Weakness can be a strength.<br /><br />This book uses different means and methods, yet arrives at a similar connection to the message we explore on NoSuperHeroes.com<br /><br />It is not always about being bigger, better, faster, or stronger. In my book Death of the Modern Superhero, I explore how the gospel of grace breaks many of the rules we are taught through society. Gladwell does the same thing.<br /><br />He starts with the story of David and Goliath. He argues that perhaps the most famous illustration of the underdog winning, may not be what it seems.<br /><br />Goliath was trained in hand to hand combat, David had superior technology in his use of the sling, that he could attack from a distance.<br /><br />Goliath seems to have been a plodding, large man with poor eyesight, perhaps even suffering from acromegaly. David was nimble and quick on his feet, not being weighed down by armor.<br /><br />Perceived disadvantage is not always actual disadvantage.<br /><br />Gladwell goes on to explore many other examples and stories, showing how disability, discrimination, or breaking the rules of what is commonly known as strength can be the cause for a seemingly improbable victory. He shares the inspiring story of a tiny French village, Le Chambon, which stood up to the powerful Nazi army refusing to give up the Jews they were harboring.<br /><br />While not as exciting as his previous books, such as Outliers or The Tipping Point, David and Goliath is still a great read. I devoured it in one week after receiving a free copy, along with all 13,000 participants of the Catalyst Conference where Gladwell spoke.<br /><br />At the conference Gladwell added one additional qualification which helped David defeat Goliath to his nimble feet and superior technology. He said when someone has the Spirit of the Lord they are not the underdog.<br /><br />This was perhaps a glimpse into the journey of rediscovering his faith Gladwell has been on while researching and writing this book. This interview illustrates it more.<br /><br />Isn't it amazing, that the weakness the gospel promotes can be found through many paths, including research and psychology.<br /><br />Gladwell took a different path than many of us do, but ended up in the same place. &#34;But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.&#34; 2 Corinthians 12:9<br /><br />Let me leave you with part of Gladwell's conclusion:<br /><br />&#34;It is not the privileged and the fortunate who took in the Jews in France. it was the marginal and the damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening...You see the giant and the Shepherd...and your eye is drawn to the man with the sword and shield and the glittering armor. But so much of what is beautiful and valuable in the world comes from the shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine.&#34;all 13,000 participants of the Catalyst Conference where Gladwell spoke.<br /><br />At the conference Gladwell added one additional qualification which helped David defeat Goliath to his nimble feet and superior technology.

B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I had very low expectations based on the bad press this film received, but my family really enjoyed it. It was gripping at times, sweet, and enjoyable. There were a couple lines that were cheesy or made me laugh but nothing that would make me dislike this film. I loved the father-son bond and the life lessons exchanged between parent and child. I have nothing bad to say about this film. It was weird to see Will Smith so serious -- I'll always remember him as the Fresh Prince. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light suspenseful movie with a strong family message.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Grate game so far. I must say it's better then the last one I try to download . The aiming is a little hard but if you played other ones you would not have any trouble
B008PU8SR4|4.0|Easy to read and very entretaining, I hope there were more books like this. The book is as strange as its tittle though.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I do consider myself a (under 40) Dylan fan, but I had heard such bad things about New Morning and Self Portrait, I've just never bothered. But I usually prefer outtakes and bootlegs to produced releases, so I listened to this album first on Spotify. I became obsessed with \\"Went to the Gypsy\\" and \\"Time Passes Slowly\\" on disc one. There certainly are a couple dud songs, but it's interesting coming from the viewpont of not quite knowing the history. Dylan's voice is superb (I am in the minority about the crooner voice, I think), even if the songs themselves aren't great. I'm sure I'll listen to the originals at some point, but for now I'm basking in these sort of low-fi versions.<br /><br />The Bootleg Series hasn't failed me yet. These are treasures that every music collector should own.

B00005QHV5|5.0|I agree with what all of the 5-star ratings say, musically and sonically. I won't add to that.<br /><br />But, honestly, in this day and age, it is the little things.<br /><br />Most cds (and cases) I buy are these days thin and flimsy and feel very fragile and cheap. These cds and cases are thick and heavy, just like the old days.<br /><br />That being said, one of the cases didn't completely survive the shipping process, but it wasn't to the fault of Gunter Wand.<br /><br />I could use a few more liner notes, but that's nitpicking. Besides, we live in the information age. There's tons of information on the internet.<br /><br />First class all the way and very reasonably priced for what you get.
B00EA8UEZ4|1.0|When 'Arten' gave his explanation for the hijacked planes not running into the World Trade Centre and leaves you dangling they totally lost my interest.  Where are the hijacked planes and the people who were on them?  Why was this even brought up again.  The biggest forgiveness lesson I took from this book is that I read it.<br /><br />I have edited this review, not because I have a new question but because after reading Mike's explanation for the planes on the World Trade Centre, I was blown away and couldn't believe that many people need that much Drama in their lives.  Seriously, why don't you read some Science about what happened 'Nutty 9-11 Physics - University of Wisconsin - Green Bay' you will find it among the many conspiracy theories.  In the past I held a blasting ticket and some of that conspiracy drama is right up there with Reality TV, you are welcome to worship it but don't try and hijack 'A Course in Miracles' with it.<br /><br />If you want to know about 'A Course in Miracles' read 'The Disappearance of the Universe' it is entertaining and informative.  If you want Self Serving Drama 'Love Has Forgotten No One'.

B007EC27QM|5.0|The calculator is easy to read with large type and it underlines the numbers and function that is being used.<br />It is at my disposal immediately and I can read it clearly.<br />Thank you for this app!  I love it!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This has become a classic Christmas movie for me and my family. I think my favorite thing about this movie is it's about all kinds of love, at all ages. Love that's working, love that's struggling, unrequited love, love as life ends, new love. Good for all ages and all sexes.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|I love this film, which I first saw on this blu-ray that I bought with great anticipation.<br /><br />The documentary is phenomenal, and is eye-opening if one has little education on the subject; and will still be informative even if you do.<br /><br />The picture quality is simply amazing on my HD TV, as is the sound quality (and I don't have a sound bar or speaker system, just the little speakers inside my TV).<br /><br />However, NOT ONE feature of this blu-ray, other than the movie itself, works AT ALL-- not any of the many extras, not even \\"Jump to a Scene\\"!  I have a 2013 Sony blu-ray player, and it plays every US blu-ray that I have (over 125 of them) perfectly, including the extras.  The extras on one British-made (so-called Region-free) blu-ray of mine fail to work, and now those on this b-r of \\"Inside Job.\\"  What's more, once you click on most of the extras, you are put into an endless loop while seeing the same, still, menu screen, though the menu choices disappear; you must press \\"Stop\\" to get out of this, and then your blu-ray, if you press \\"Play,\\" will take a full minute or two to re-engage.  This is a crap b-r, technically!  You'd think they could get this right.  Oh well.<br /><br />However, again, the documentary is simply great.  Recommended highly.  Just don't expect to be able to view ANY of the extras.  I'm hoping that this b-r will work with other brands of blu-ray player that I may purchase in the coming years . . .
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie has a quirky storyline and a bunch of fine actors to make it believable and enjoyable. Really a fun couple of hours.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|The previews looked so good and I'm a fan of Will Smith. The day it came out I snatched it up and rushed home to watch it. At one point I dozed off and overall, I'm mad to have totally wasted twenty dollars. It's a horrible movie.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Gonzo as narrator takes us through the classic Dickens story in great style. Add to that singing mice, rabbits, fruit, even mea,t and a bunch of very hummable tunes and you've got a hit. (&#34;There goes Mr. Humbug, there goes Mr. Scrooge&#34; is the opening line of one tune.) And Kermit and Miss Piggy as Bob Cratchit and his wife. How great is that?!
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|great game. I really like the game its fun and entertaining. you have to figure out the puzzles and remember number stuff. what fun.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This is a beautifully made film for child-to-young adult watchers. The boy in the story is dealing with his father having been declared missing during World War II. He goes to live with his grandmother in the home where his father grew up, a home that has a personality of its own. Well acted, good setting, satisfying (not saccarin) ending. Great to watch over and over.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|David Sedaris remains a very funny fellow - but, sadly, not as funny as he thinks.  While some of this book's sections were absolutely hilarious, much of it was shopping, trite and, in far too many sections, elitist.  It's tragic that parts of the book were downright boring.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love having a place where I can look up any and all information when I am away from my computer.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I'd just like to say that I wish Beyond Bridal Veil Fall,Dwellers of the Ahwahnee was available when I was a young girl. Imagine turning eighteen and getting the surprise of your life as young Oria finds she has traveled into another realm, one where her ancestors of her tribe, the Ahwanneechees were said  to have traveled . Her tribe originated out of the Yosemite Park lands and it just may be the portal that she ventured through into this unknown realm. She finds herself mingling with the ancestors, dwellers and fairies. She meets the grandfather of the tribe who seems to know the real reason why she is there, but it is a  shock to Oria to find out she is the `Golden Queen' and destined to be the one to save this realm and many others from an unseen evil that has been lurking in their village.  Action and adventure await her in her new home.She will even find the love of her life who also has some secrets up his sleeve.<br /><br />I fell in love with this story right away as I am taken with so many of the Native American legends and lore. The spiritual quotes from the grandfather are so enlightening throughout the whole story. They not only seemed to be for Oria, but for the reader as well. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel, Beyond Oria Falls.
B00BEOYPCK|4.0|The album is great, I still put it on regularly. However, Track 1 Side 1 Walkin on a Pretty Day (a great song) has some pretty nasty scratching and distortion throughout the track. I'm disappointed that this pressing seems to be sub-par. You run this risk with vinyl though, especially new releases, so I'm not going to stress it too much.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|If I had to have only one album in my library, this would be it.  I listen to it over and over again and never tire of it.  Must have for all demographics  ;)  Appeals to just about everybody.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great sense of humor.  Lots of technical jargon but suspenseful and I laughed out loud at certain points. A worthwhile read.
0062200909|5.0|There are a lot of dwarfs, really a lot, and a lot of research for the beards and moustaches, funny.<br />But then again, we'll have Smaug for the next one :-)
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|How can anybody, human or nonhuman think of writing such a story??  You gotta wonder about this author big time.
1608871827|5.0|Kind of still feeling hungry for more monsters designs,<br />strange book with all these gadgets in it, worth the money (and already sold-out),

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I wanted to like this game. I love the Jurassic park franchise and this game did a great job representing it.  However even as a free to play game, it's pacing is really slow and getting gold is very difficult. But it is still a great game and I would recommend trying it for yourself.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a really good app i recommended it to all of you who get sometimes bored you can play this game and its really fun and kinda addicting

B004LWZWGA|3.0|In spite of the fact of the continued upscale production values, I find this one a bit of a bore. Bane is a henchman, not a star villain, yet he goes on like an Orson Wells with a mean streak and doesn't know when to shut up. Anne Hathaway's catwoman somehow misses the mark although she is more interesting to me than Bane. It is for this reason DKR fails. If Batman doesn't have interesting villains, he is not complete, as the tremendous Joker in Heath Ledger's unparalleled performance once described his own need for the Batman. I keep thinking miss Emma Peel of the TV show The Avengers could easily tangle with Anne Hathaway's seemingly superior catwoman, & that is just not right. Bane, on the other hand, needs to get off his egotistical  throne to spare us his muffled foreign ramblings.
B00FEN000S|5.0|This is the first movie this year that we have rented or bought that I have actually put down my laptop to watch.  Very impressed that there was no nudity or sex scenes in this one.  A science fiction movie that is centered around action and science fiction!  Don't recall too much profanity either. Oh how I wish more movies were made today like this one!  Just great to watch a movie that doesn't seem to focus on love scenes or nudity.  If I wanted to see that then I'd rent a x-rated movie.  When I watch science fiction...I want to see the creatures/science/action/good graphics and this movie delivers all of that.  Definitely worth watching.  I won't compare it to Transformers as I haven't actually watched those...used my laptop through those as well.  It even through in humor from time to time.  Good ending too.  Seems like if I find a good movie it's ruined by the ending but not with this one.  We ended up buying this one and we do not regret that as we will definitely be watching this one again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so cool! If I hadn't found it I would be bored out of my mind!!!<br />! Whoever made this game I love you.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|No words to describe how awesome this movie is. If you like Zepplin you have to have this in your collection! John Bonham's drum solo will give you goosbumps!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging but fun hidden objects/problem solving game. It works on memory skills as well. It's just a great all around game to work the brain and keep it sharp.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I am not a fan of science fiction by any stretch of the imagination, however the story line of Ender's Game is most compelling, and quite fitting given the current worldwide political and economic situations.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the entire series; if for no other reason than to discover if the author bowed to the pressure of the publishing house and delivers a watered down version of the story that they believe will sell as in the case of the writer of the Harry Potter series, or was courageous enough to write down just as The Muse did dictate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book leaves you in suspense the whole time! the ending is amazing. I can't wait to start on the third book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I may have gotten stuck a few and asked google for help.. but it was still fun!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|this is awsome,  ignore the negitive comments love the game. perfect controls, perfect graphics this is best rally game (to me) ever!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I just finished this book and what a great read. The twists and turns, the way all the characters intertwined. For Pete sake, even the epilogue was great. If you want to read a fantastic story with great character development, this is it.

1600243916|5.0|Since I do a lot of driving, I &#34;read&#34; the audio-book. I was fascinated and &#34;Couldn't put it down.&#34; I have always believed guys like Bill Gates succeeded because they worked hard and were basically one of a kind, which is true. What I hadn't considered is how much luck and timing (when you were born) plays into people's success. When you hear the author explain it, it just makes sense. I found the benchmark of 10,000 hours of hard work required to truly master something to also be an AHA! moment.<br /><br />There are two elements required for a successful audio-book, an excellent book, and an excellent performer to read it. This title has both. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Mark L. Rosenfeld<br />Author [[ASIN:B00ENM3J1S You Can Be The Next Millionaire Landlord]]

B0041KKYEM|1.0|\\"Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for. \\" So wrote Kurt Vonnegut in his short story collection Bagombo Snuff Box. Black Swan does not have a single character we can like.  (In fairness, Vonnegut went on to explain that the best writers break the rules. Maybe this dark film will be to your liking.)
B008602KQI|5.0|I felt drawn to watch this movie several times.  I found the cruelty of other human beings hard to grasp at first, but when I thought about it, what is different in our country is only a matter of years away.  I was struck by the parallels, the allegory as Donald Sutherland says.<br />A great movie, if you are up to it.
B0094LUH4A|4.0|A very warm hearted love story . Saw it years ago when it first came out and it was just as good many years later. Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford are so young. Where does the time go?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game GREAT graphics. Fun to play especially for horse lovers. Great game you'll love it . 5 stars rated. Enjoy!

B006W33UC4|5.0|This is the BEST of dance music to come out in ages.  I HATE the crap called \\"disco dance music\\" that has poisoned the airwaves and releases on Amazon since the early 80's.  It's all the same bump bump bump beat created by electronics and digital methods to eliminate REAL musicians and to lower the cost of producing records.  All of the music on this set are created by REAL studio musicians, not a computer. Tom Moulton was around in the 70's to help create extended singles instead of the usual 3 minute pablum played on radio.  It created thicker bass lines and grooves you couldn't get out 3 minutes or less.  This is the music I listen to whether I'm working out, dog walking or cleaning my house.  These disco treasures will live on forever so get it while it's still available.  Do I HIGHLY recommend this?  ABSOLUTELY!  You can now dump your Lady Gaga, Pink, the reinvented Cher and Madonna garbage, along with so many others and listen to some REAL disco dance music.
0793535093|4.0|ABB songs are great. It's amazing how hard it is to play<br />Duane and Dickey licks even when you have them right in front of you<br />and can also listen to them and attempt to emulate.  This is a great tool and<br />resource, not just to see what ABB played and how, but as general education<br />on guitar licks to add to your repertoire.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app is definitely one of the first couple of apps you should install when you get a new Android phone or tablet. It completely makes everything easier, less cluttered and organized. I have been using this app since 2011 and I've never uninstalled it or found anything better than it. It's an original. This app helps you to sort apps into categories and puts them in their own folders which you can then add to your homescreen as it's own folder or a widget. It comes already prepare with a variety if categories and icons but you can also and and delete your very own categories and search for icons on the internet or use your own from your gallery. This app is extremely useful and you will wonder what you did without it. I would definitely reccomend  this app to anyone.

B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I got this game as one of Amazon's free app of the day. However, I had always wanted to try it before because it looked like it could be fun. It definitely is too. It's very nicely made and the graphics are 3d and very high quality as the game description describes. You can customize the characters from head to toe and gameplay is fast and exciting. I did enjoy playing it for a while, but it did get a little boring after a while. I would still reccomed it, because the boxing is fun to play, and the graphics are terrific, but after a while it becomes the same old thing.

0385743564|4.0|It seems sort of strange to say that this book got off to a slow start, when it's action-packed all the way through. But what I mean is that I didn't find the beginning very interesting (with the exception of the prologue), and I wasn't really caught up in the story until about halfway through. At first, I felt like there was just too much action and not enough meaningful character interaction or relevations about the new world that Sanderson has created.<br /><br />As always, Sanderson's work is premised on an interesting magic system (or in this case, maybe something technological or alien?). At some point in the very near future, certain people gained superhuman powers. Basically, this is a superhero story, but with a twist: there are no heroes, only villains. Everyone with superpowers is evil. David saw his father get killed in a random attack when he was a child, and has devoted the rest of his life to getting revenge.<br /><br />The basic concept of seeking revenge, while understandable and full of dangerous escapades, just wasn't very compelling to me. It was sort of hard to relate when David walked into a weapons store and felt like he was in heaven. I was more interested in the relationships that he did eventually develop with other characters with similar goals, in the moral dilemmas about whether it was worth killing a tyrannical ruler even at the cost of stability, in the questions about what caused the development of these superpowers and how they functioned. Fortunately, we do get to all of these issues eventually, and there are even some surprising twists.<br /><br />By the end, I found myself eager to read on and find out what happened, and I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion. This is the first book of a series, though, so not everything is fully resolved. I'm sad that I'll have to wait almost a whole year to continue with this story, and I'll definitely be buying the sequel as soon as possible. I'm sort of amazed that my initial lack of interest could be so totally overcome, but I guess I should have expected that from Sanderson. There's a reason I keep reading this guy's books, and I'm not about to stop now.nterest could be so totally overcome, but I guess I should have expected that from Sanderson.

B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Review of version 1.40...<br /><br />* No ad provider technologies (e.g. admob) embedded in the app (+1 star)<br />* Only three permissions used-- read external storage, write external storage and Internet (+1 star)<br />* Clean and intuitive interface that is easy to use when on-the-go (+2 stars)<br />* Click the dice icon for a random effect (+1 star)<br /><br />This app may not have all the bells and whistles of its competitors, but the simplicity and flexibility is a refreshing change.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's hard to find books like this that seem so real, so possible and are so compelling.  It seems to me that Mr. Howdy has done a great job imagining a consequence to unimaginable actions in the real world we all have to share.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I bought the orange and it's a great color, straight up orange, not light or pastel or some other slightly weird color. The hard shell works great with the Nite-Ize stickon belt clip I use. The TPU plastic protects it from drops well from a couple feet on to concrete or several feet on to office carpet. I unfortunately have tested this a couple times already in the 2 weeks I have had it. The small lip around the screen helps keep the screen from contacting a flat surface when placed face down. The openings for cables, buttons, and speakers all seem to work well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is brilliant! It is a challenge, but gets much easier as the game goes on, and you learn to play it better. The only down side is this: once you get to times 30, you can  level up anymore. And, say if you accidentally delete this game and download it again, it forgets all your data and you have to start from the start. Sad face :(
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|Great release, but the packaging could have included more. That being said, I'm very impressed this is titled stone temple pilots with Chester Bennington . At least the band acknowledges it isn't just STP. For me that was huge because it isn't just STP. I think each song is very good, still miss Scott's voice though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Sometimes it glitches but it's good. Make sure you update it sometimes. It's a good game and I love it. You should get it. :D
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game freezes regularly which is unbelievably frustrating and I see many other users complain about the same problem.  It's not worth the trouble.

B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  It is my new favorite.  I especially love &#34;Mississippi Road House&#34;.  Stephen Stills, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Barry Goldberg.  What a combination of talents.  Their live shows are also tremendous, just like the CD.
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|This isn't a bad collection of songs but I was expecting more.<br />To me, the vocals should have been brought more to the front in the final mix.<br />I enjoy music with strong lyrics and to here the singer perform them.<br />Bowie's voice gets kind of lost in the mix.<br />Over all, I think I would rather spend my time listing to his classics instead of this CD.  It just doesn't offer any exciting songs that I want to listen to repeatedly.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this CD after I pre-ordered it.  It was well worth the wait.  It is one excellent CD.

B00FPH6AXE|3.0|So I have read a bunch of reviews on here that joined the band wagon of totally trashing this movie as the worst thing that ever happened to a big budget Sci-Fi movie/production; honestly there are plenty of other movies that in my opinion really blew it up big time, but I do not think this one is that bad.<br />* for the sake of spoilers I will be as ambiguous as possible:<br />Yes the acting is weak and feels like they are trying too hard, granted some ideas in this movie are a bit funny: speech, creatures encountered throughout and their interaction with main character, climate and so on... notion of evolving things could have been pushed much further, and the story leaves us a bit unclear about few key points regarding the enemy, humankind, past, present, new dwelling, etc. So it is not as deep as Odyssey 2001 - although some argue that one was a bore of a movie too.... At the end you can not please everyone, not an Oscar performance yet not a complete disaster either.<br /><br />It was not as bad as anticipated, for a mind-free movie night on a couch I did not completely waste my 5 buck on this rental.

B003DDKAT2|5.0|Tom Cruise is  a great vampire, before they became all glittery and stuff. I love this movie and Claudia is the epitome of a tortured soul doomed to be a child forever. Can you imagine?
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Quite entertaining but I found it to be a battery hog for some reason. I guess because when you open it it stays running in the background even though you may be doing something else on your device. It is accumulating tokens and play time while you are away until you actually turn off the device itself. It's still fun, you just need to know the functional aspects behind the scenes.
B000BT97AO|5.0|You look at this movie and may think it to be odd, but really it is a great movie. I have been told that i do like complex plots and such, and i wont lie, this is a little more advanced plot, but it is a great movie, and i suggest you watch it! I have been told that this movie sucks, it does not. If you don't like it, that is your own opinion and i am sorry for you, but i do recommend this be watched. I love this movie so much! Please just watch it and you will see what i am talking about, see how great of a movie it is. That is all i have to say, if i haven't convinced my point of how great this movie is, well i am greatly sorry. I will express one more time how much i think you should watch this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is by far my favorite game on my kindle. I liked it so much that I downloaded it a second time : A) because I accidently dumped it and B) Because I wanted to start it all over again. It plays in so many variations you never get tired of it. Although I had used it a couple of times to help me get to sleep... Buy It.

B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I don't know who spread the, \\" Hate this movie before it's release\\" Virus, but I fell for it!  Today, after watching it via redbox I thought it was AWESOME! A pure delight. The visuals are on par with Avatar. The creatures were not to far fetched. And as for Jayden I looked at him as UP and coming, he is developing, a visual transformation before our eyes from little boy to young man; in the movie and in real life.<br /><br />I think that everyones problem here is that they keep trying to compare Jayden to Will Smith. Will Smith started out a lot later in life and developed his acting skills over time. Lets just say Will is a long way from Fresh Prince and in time Jayden will come into his own as well.<br /><br />Overall Judging the movie for what it's worth. I give it a Solid B'. I would buy this movie.

B000FCKIFU|5.0|After reading a couple of David Baldacci's \\"sweet and mushy\\" books, I was really anxious to get back to one of his good ole' political thrillers.  The Camel Club definitely does not disappoint.  This was one of my favorites (so far) by this author, and it was great to see him return to form.  Yes, the plot is a little silly, but it is, after all, a work of fiction.  Even though it's a bit farfetched at times, the story definitely kept me hooked.<br /><br />The story centers around a group of four, somewhat bizarre, eclectic characters living in Washington D.C. that call themselves \\"The Camel Club\\".  They're definitely what most would consider oddballs.  I don't remember how the story tells us how they all originally got together, but they're essentially conspiracy theorists that look under every nook and cranny every time the American government does something that doesn't wash well with this group.  Our story mainly focuses on the \\"leader\\" of this bunch, who goes by the moniker of \\"Oliver Stone\\".  Surprise surprise.<br /><br />Well, one night, when it's very dark and foggy, the Camel Club is meeting in one of its secret locations out in (what they think is) the middle of nowhere, and they just happen to witness a suspicious looking murder.  Scary?  Definitely.  Exciting?  Much more so.  The Camel Club springs into action!<br />There's actually a lot more going on in this story.  So much that it's a bit easy to get lost in the early chapters of this book, and you almost give up with all of the new faces cropping up every chapter or so.  Patience is required, and it's well rewarded as well.  One of the main characters in the story outside this fearsome foursome is none other than one of the government's secret service agents, who just happens to pass by \\"Oliver Stone\\" from time to time.  It seems as though Stone has a \\"protest tent\\" (or something) and he spends a lot of his free time camped out across the street from The White House along with an assortment of other peculiar regulars.  So the story casually allows these two parties to meet and combine forces.<br /><br />Then, it seems as though there is a terrorist plot by some Mid-Eastern characters in the state of Pennsylvania.  The President of the United States is due in the state shortly.  He was born and raised there, and a celebration is about to take place whereas his home town will be renamed after him.  So a lot of time is spent with these terrorists as they plan their diabolical deed.<br /><br />This is actually where things get a bit interesting.  Unlike every Vince Flynn novel, we feel for these terrorists.  They're not a bunch of brain washed zealots that hate America for no reason other than to hate America.  They have legitimate gripes, and Baldacci is careful to spend time detailing what a lot of grievances these folks actually have.  So much time, that many readers find this book a bit on the unpatriotic side.  I think that's a stretch, as we find out as the story unfolds.<br /><br />So all of these human trains that seem to be going in all different directions on all different tracks manage to collide near the end of the story, and I felt that the climax of the book was very well done.  To be honest, there were a bit too many \\"coincidences\\" amongst the revelations of some of these characters' past, but all of that was a minor sin. This book would make a good \\"thriller\\" movie.  If done right, that is.  It was nice to have Mr. Baldacci \\"back\\".peculiar regulars.

B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I love this book. I first read it many years ago in my teens and I've read it many times since then. It's remained one of my favorites. Although the characters are compelling I often find the supporting characters in this book much more interesting. The story is compelling, and although the outcome is inevitable, the way in which the outcome is achieved is excellent. Story and characters aside, it's the socio-religio-political insights that have made this book a classic, and over the years, as I've matured and learned more about the world, repeated rereadings of this book allow me to see the many layers of excellent analysis and allegory available here. It's been a consistent favorite of mine for many years and I look forward to reading it many more times. This book is almost an old friend that I enjoy catching up on from time to time.

B00280LYIC|4.0|Riordan's genius in this series shows from his ability to take ancient Greek myths and transpose them into the modern world. The fast pace of this novel (and the fact that the hero is 12) should grab most teens and their parents by the scruff of the neck and drag them along breathlessly to the last page. It sets up the series nicely and does one more key thing: introduces the reader to the concepts of Greek mythology, a series of tall and morbid tales that every western youngster should be familiar with.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed it overall. Some of the ideas are interesting, such as Western Civilization being the life-energy of the gods. Percy is a very likeable character despite his penchant for destroying his schools (and, no, it never is his fault, no matter what his teachers may think). The hallmarks of his character are very positive and while he ends up having to do some rather not-so-good things, his motives are good. His companions are fun, too, with the smart and sassy Annabeth and the seemingly cowardly Grover. This book and the attendant series goes on my shelf of great series to read over and over again (behind Tolkien, Lewis, Lawhead and Peters).<br /><br />Some more serious Christians will find this book a little disturbing, though likely less so than the Harry Potter series. My word to them is to view it as a parable of selflessness (and Percy is quite selfless while thinking he's being selfish) and a chance to discuss the primary difference between Christianity and the ancient religions that Christianity had to face during its infancy. Discerning readers may even see some interesting parallels of the beliefs of the ancient Greeks as Riordan retells them to modern-day thought processes and opinions.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|When I read 'Disappointing' in the Blu-ray review, it was hard to believe!  It's been true of other Star Trek films and I was sad to see that Paramount did not put more respect, more love into this highly anticipated, long-awaited, no doubt difficult follow-up to the first flick. While the first Star Trek blu-ray was filled with interesting bonus material and promotional Trailers, this was just the opposite. Very shallow content and not even one Trailer from the movie itself!  Not for nothing, some of them were good! I do like Star Trek which accounts for the high rating, but the release has a shoddy feeling to it.

It's sad that we've gotten only the ALL 4:3 version that doesn't show the beauty and art of the new 4:3/16:9 that exists but is not being fully shared. A double/triple-dip is no doubt on the way. 1 Star deducted for ALL 4:3 format.

B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I must admit that when I got to the end of this long journey, my new 3D HDTV started malfunctioning.  Which greatly interrupted the meaning and flow of the ending.  After fixing the issue, I re-watched the end and cannot wait to see the entire movie again. The ending, if you have no idea of what's coming, begs re-watching.  The 3D effects, the quality of the transfer, the stunning sound track and of course, a story that you'll never forget!!!  Five stars.

As someone who enjoys running half marathons(and working as an artist) I can relate to alot of the material. It won't give you much insight on running, but it's an enjoyable read about his experiences.  Now onto more murakami books!

B000URWYTS|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It was a great book for our book club. Couldn't believe the twists in it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Any PAID APP that continuously asks if you want to BUY another app is less-than-one star in my book.<br /><br />Upon turning off your alarm, every time, &#34;Do you want this other useless weather app?&#34; So every morning you're woken up to its endless advertising. You have to turn off your alarm THEN say NO to the app before getting your phone back. Some people clearly don't mind but the endless shilling by these shady apps makes me nuts.  I tried for a month and then deleted. You can have my $.99 cents.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I think this is good for learning.  It complements what I learned in school.  I am also using to teach my kids some words and phrases.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thriller! I loved it! The book kept me interested and I had already made my husband get me the third one because I just have to know what happens!!!!
0824835921|5.0|I started learning kanji the standard rote way - writing them a lot, daily flashcards, reading what I could (catch 22 there). After getting to １級 level and just about 1000 kanji, I realized I was forgetting them nearly as fast as I learned them. I came across way too many that I knew that I knew, but I could no longer recall them as well, not to mention it was too easy to mix up similar kanji.<br /><br />I decided to start over, using the Heisig method. I'm on Chp 25, kanji #796, and not only am I remembering them well, but I'm having fun.<br /><br />Just as the title says, this book is all about remembering the damn kanji. It does not teach you pronunciation or how to read. BUT! - your reading and vocabulary retention will improve significantly.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not sure about is WHEN to start this book. Many suggest starting it from the get-go, at the beginning of your Japanese studies after learning kana. I'm not confident that is the right time, simply because one's vocabulary will be so small that you won't get the vast majority of the benefit of the book. In the meantime while you build vocabulary, you will have to keep working on your RTK flashcards or whatever so you don't lose your kanji knowledge.<br /><br />While I haven't &#34;playtested&#34; the idea yet, I'm thinking that a beginner should go ahead and start normally, learning kana and then picking up high frequency kanji like numbers and days of the week, basic verbs and so forth. Once you really start to dive into the language and you get that itch for kanji, then do this book. Kick butt.<br /><br />Oh, and the website Reviewing the Kanji is a perfect supplement. There are tons of ready-made stories on there that can really speed things up. Just remember to have a story for each kanji that makes a strong image on you!
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|7 year old likes it even thought it takes him a while to find things he needs. It keeps him busy.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book is truly amazing and when a colleague of my asked to recommend a book for her daughter who is in the sixth grade , well it was an easy choice... One of my all time favorite.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|2 year old granddaughter loves this. She likes the pictures and is able to find the hidden items when she is going thru pages.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Definitely something to keep in the archives. I need to buy a copy for the car.  Can listen to the entire cd.
0345803493|5.0|you have to read this book! When you are reading this book you can feel what they are feeling! plus for the price i paid for the book it was worth it!
B00B2TUKI0|1.0|Music is a very personal thing, and this CD was highly recommended by a friend. The CD has bizarre songs and her voice is flat on many of the songs. I lent the CD to a friend who did not like it as well. After all the hype, it comes down to how a voice added to music speaks to you. This did not speak to me.
0345803485|5.0|I took my time reading this book for the second time and i love it! Everyone needs a little Fifity
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|now she is , madonna, she is crazy, sexy??, roarrrr, she have a tongue, OMG she licks hammers nad ride balls naked.<br />In the next album, she is going to be a femme fatale , sexy ,  in control............<br /><br />Rebember Dirrty from Aguilera...
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|he is who he is and if you are a fan it will not disapoint. for this day and age, a welcome breath of fresh air.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I have to admit that except for the presence of George Clooney I wouldn't have bothered to even go to see this movie , but I got to watch it on the plane, and I'm so glad I did.  It was even better the second time I watched it when I came home.  I knew that this was the type of film I would watch over again so I bought it.  The music was so wonderful that I also bought the sound track.  Bridges was really good in the small part he had, it was good to see him  again.  This movie was not at all what I expected, and every one was perfectly cast and believable.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|It's fun to play has nice graphics and is easy to catch on.<br />I like how when the cards attack they come out of the cards and you can hear the sound.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|This watch is very well made and excellent quality. I collect watches and this one is my favorite. I also get  alot of complements on my new watch. I highly recommend this watch to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|instructions are so difficult yet so seemingly simple, took me 3 days to get it to work, through trial and error.  Boy there are a lot of errors.  Got it to cast from my laptop, but from the phone, forget it.  Great when it works.  Keep the $35 and try to improve it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|A movie that keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat is right. Between the fights actions and race actions, you find yourself getting closer the your TV.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I read this for our Mostly Mystery Book Club.  The insights into London of the Blitz was not pleasant but historically important and needed for the story line.  The author kept me fully engaged throughout the story.  The characters were well delineated and made me care.  Some of our group did not like the timeline jumping back and forth like it did but I thought it added immediacy to the story being told.
B00000G3I2|5.0|This is my wife favorite love story. It kind of reminds me of the TV series of&#34;Dallas&#34;. I enjoy watching her getting into this movie.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|An absolutely dreadful attempt at movie making. I cannot recall a worse sci-fi movie. Perhaps useful as an inspirational tool<br />for very young and not very bright peoole.
B003A166OK|2.0|It is probability a good movie, how ever, I did not like the roll Clint Eastwood played in this movie.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Like the original Series the Wrath of Kahn was an excellent movie and with the new cast in a new time line this movie repeated that success. Excellent Movie!
B00F5FBE82|2.0|I dont mind Drake singing his own hooks but all but two songs, Started from the Bottom & Pound Cake are soft R&B tracks. I like the RAPPER Drake & this album is the SINGER Drake. As a R&B album its great but not what I was looking forward to.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Everyone should read Anita Moorjani's story.  It is highly inspirational and gives us all hope and how to enjoy what we have here.  She spreads the word of joy and happiness while you are here on earth and why we should do it.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Richie Kotzen is an incredible talent. He is a Chris Cornell on steroids and he can play the guitar like no other.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Gory, camp and horrible stereotyping. Some of the acting (voice and accent) is straight out of the movie Wild Wild West.  At least that was a comedy.
0744014956|4.0|This book has it all, from maps and walk-throughs to pictures of every vehicle in the game.  However, it doesn't have anything about online play.  If I could make changes to the book, it would include online info and have less &#34;game art&#34; pages.
B0058A119G|5.0|I caught the PBS briadcast, once with my wife present and a year later after she had Graduated into her next grandest dream of what life can be.  Some call this &#34;heaven&#34;.  So as I losten to this CD I have grand memories of many times in my life, loves ... and I can dream about &#34;What Matter's Most&#34;!
B000002OTL|5.0|If you are a true \\"Pulp\\" fan then this CD is a must.  It starts off with \\"Hunny Bunny\\" announcing the restaurant robbery, then right into the music.  Key, iconic scenes from the film are highlighted taking you right back to the movie every time.  The recording quality is very good.  Again, if you really love the film you need this disc.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a big Sci-Fi fan and this is one of the best. The quality of the movies and the sound track are great to say the least. The ability to see all the movies in the same format is the best reason to see this series as it is.
B00DURHYWC|4.0|I have all of PM's albums and enjoy each one.  What's new here is singer Storm Large and several songs with male vocals.  Storm is a strong singer and she works well with the music.  I still really enjoy China Forbes' style, but as stated, Storm's efforts work very well.  The songs are, as usual, eclectic.  Pink Martini is about as eclectic as it gets.  More importantly, their music is fun and very well recorded.  Phyllis Diller is almost enjoyable and that is sayin' something.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another fab Reacher book. I appreciate the action as well as the portrayal at Holly as strong and capable. Well done Mr. Child. Well done.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I had an account but i logged off for a min.

B0026S93C0|5.0|One of the best dance movies of all time. Have watched this at least 30 times.. Jennifer Beals is perfect for this roll!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. At first it was hard to get into but once I did the book was impossible to put down. I gave the book four stars because I wish the ending was happier but  all in all the storyline was fantastic. I praise this book. It truly was fantastic.
B0026SFEW8|5.0|A classic 50s themed movie with great music and actors Olivia newton john and John Travolta are a great pair!
034580404X|5.0|These books are great!! Wish there were more than three in the series.  All my friends are borrowing them now.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A beautifully told story of such weight and sorrow that it pulled one back in time to experience the unthinkable.  The girl had such courage surviving Himmel Street and living a full, measured life.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is the best app ever! It is a fun way to get creative! Me and my friend will type in Maxwell and it will give us a Maxwell clone !
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was drawn in, once again, by a mezmerizing tale. Held until I finished reading it, which was way to soon. Would recommend to all of my family, from the eight year old granddaughter, to my my sixty something spouse.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|...pun intended. There was excitement, humor and out of the box fun, along with a whole lot of action. Nicely done!!
1405911662|5.0|Could not wait to see what would happen next and could not guess either!  Not a feel good bk, but def a great read !
B0050DIWFC|4.0|After a bit of a sluggish start - this book grabbed my attention and I really enjoyed it.  Aside from a couple of questions that emerged to me as a parent - the book was fast paced and suspenseful.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This cover's simplistic design just exudes the style and function I wanted and provides the desired protection without being overdone.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I loved the first 3 books in this series.  Four and five are more-or-less one book, and I can see why it is split this way, but I was starting to get a little confused and having trouble remembering where all the different characters and plot lines were at any given point in Dragons. I sort of felt as if the whole structure is beginning to wobble under its own weight.  Nonetheless, if and when #6 comes out, I will be in line with my credit card!
1863514260|5.0|This book is beautiful. Trish Burr really explains the concept of choosing colors for shading and gives beautiful pictures and instructions for achieving beautiful results. I would highly recommend this book to all needle painters!
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|I normally don't write reviews of albums but felt obliged to say something.  Anyone who has followed James Labrie through his career will appreciate how amazing this album is.  It represents a culmination of his talents as a singer and songwriter and the passion, intelligence and finesse at every level that has gone into this musical gem.  The incredible vocals, the superb guitar of Sfogli, the drumming, bass and keyboards and overall production quality - they all culminate to what represents some the finest music available today.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that knocks your socks off from the beginning and gets better with each listen. The melodies are subtle but amazingly catchy and many could easily be radio hits.  The perfect combination of melody and heavy guitar without dumbing it down.  I especially appreciate how the lyrics cut to the chase without fluff and carry the passion without being over the top.  Highly addictive. Songs I want to crank to full volume in high fidelity.  If only 10% of the music I hear could be this good.  Congrats and thanks to James and the crew for making this happen and continuing to give us great tunes and making the world a better place!
1863514201|5.0|Beautiful inspiring book. Detailed instructions for this type of embroidery and beautiful pictures. I would highly recommend this book to all needle painters!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|If you want to gain some insight into the financial crash and how no one but a few realized it, then this book is as fine a place to start as any.

B00EUM6WI8|5.0|I've always been a fan of Mark Knopfler, whether via Dire Straits or when is play solo.  He is a talented guitarist & vocalist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a fun game my whole family plays. Like completing the missions and is appropriate for my young son as well.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this is a fun twist on hidden objects. my only gripe is that it takes too long to get your energy back to continent playing.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can go on and on about what this kindle fire DON'T got. But kik was one of them!! Now it won't work.... whyyyyyyy omg. I'm going to cry my eyes out if it doesn't get fixed.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I try to login to kik repeatedly but it keeps saying It is taking longer then it should be please fix this Kik is An amazing app until now
B008JFUO36|1.0|I really want to like it, but I just can't.  It is like how sometimes you can cook a meal, and all the ingredients are there, but it just comes out disappointing.  Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman and the special effects are great tools for a director to have access to.  I simply wish that he had an idea of how to use them.  I bought it new, watched it once and sold it the same day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome the updates are awesome my favorite update was the one that just came out it's awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone in my family likes to.play this game.  My 2 year old-4yr old myself and husband. Its addicting. Favorite thing about the game is that the theme changes every 5-6 weeks.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game has made me so excited and happy. The Dragon Vale is on because when u get started you won't be able to stop. Let others buy it and they will worship you. Dragon Vale ON . WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|It made much more of an impact on me by the final chapter and with notes. To find oneself is a search of all of us.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|What more can anyone say but this film is a testament of courage and not giving up. If you have not seen it see this film. You may discover courage you didn't know you had.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a very good book.  It has been very enlightening for me, and very positive.  It was nice that she had me test what she wrote.  I am a believer.  Hope you will be one too. :)
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I just started using this app and I have a lot of free books downloaded to my Kindle.  I can shop on my phone and read or listen (Text to speech) to my books later.  Thanks for the app.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I have no idea why this book is the best seller. I don't even call it a literature work. The biggest waste I have spent my money on.
B00ALCBTWU|5.0|ok. plain and simple. neither i nor my bud care about if it is -  is not historical. it's a movie. and he was tickled to get it. he is a ww2 buff and enjoys these kinds of flicks.  end of story.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Like all of King 's novels, it's a slow read. Different than his other stuff. I think I'm done reading fiction.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Finally...answers to why so many of us are fat, and keep getting fatter!  Warning, the book can get very technical at times.  The author does include some amusing comments and interesting case studies to break things up.  Bottom line - I'm giving up wheat.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was a really good Nicolas Sparks book, and movie lived up to it.  My whole family loved this movie, even my dad.  Has something for everyone.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Loved the story line and it was a lovely read. Recommend to everyone to read and makes you wonder if animals think like that
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Enjoyed the story line, the well developed characters and the setting was thought provoking.<br />The story follows a life of several characters from their point of view and how they overlap.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good way to keep me entertained because i have to beat the daily chalenge and the missions
B001L4I222|5.0|very light and funny. A comedy that reminded me of the great classics of the 1940's...A good tonic after a difficult day
B004EPYZP8|1.0|The movie NEVER played.i had already gotten rid of packaging so i couldnt send back...very disappointed...now have to purchase again
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|We put the movie on at home and forgot it was even on. At no point did it ever grab out attention. Major bummer.
1476727651|5.0|I have read Stephen King since before he got published under his own name. I have stuck with him through all of the ups and downs in my life. He has given me joy and fear for 40+ years, and in all of that, I have to say that for me this is absolutely on a par with 'The Shining', 'IT', and 'The Stand'.<br /><br />Finally we learn what happened to Daniel Anthony Torrance, and the rest of his family.
B005MIDE44|5.0|I will honestly say that not only is this the best solo album by a Wu-Tang member, but I think this is even better than anything Wu-Tang did as a group too.  I don't know why RZA's production isn't like this anymore - but on this album the music is perfectly eerie as hell.  GZA is an awesome lyricist who has stories and rhymes for days.  This is one of the best albums (of any genre) ever.
B00AR3WD8W|3.0|It's a great CD if you want to hear Elvis at his absolute worst. This is fat, drug-riddled Elvis but his voice is still great. The Vegas-style songs and show are almost embarrassing but the remastering makes the CD sound very nice.
B001BANK32|5.0|As always king did a great job. full of suspense. I now reading his new book and it is great also
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This books helps those who are willing put into practice what the author advises. Some will find topics that they can immediately relate to that cause their social life to be undesirable and solutions toward a satisfactory social life.
0307592731|1.0|Unfortunately I just questioned the credibility of some of this story.  It didn't ring true.  If however you like reading about a hiker who tosses away a hiking boot or is ill prepared and lacking good judgement, this book might be for you.
1454701250|5.0|Making An Impression is a beautiful book for beginners, well-written with lovely photos and excellent instructions on carving your own stamps. Beyond the basics, there are also tutorials on decorating things found at home, like photo frames, with stamps; making customized wall art, stationery (wrapping paper, book plate), stamped pillows, handsewn French press cozy, pillows. The book also includes projects on combining stamping with embroidery on paper and fabric, beading on a stamped design and stamping on other surfaces like polymer clay, terracotta pots, stones (very much a Geninne Zlatkis signature do), and even on the wall.<br /><br />The ideas are not unusual, but the best thing about the book is the beautiful designs. Author Zlatkis has a popular blog and is known for her handcarved stamps and illustrations. If you love her work, you will love the book. The stamp designs in Making An Impression are signature Zlatkis - birds, plants and other flora and fauna. She also provides templates for the designs used in the projects and a few pages of other motifs that will provide hours of fun for any crafter.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is awesome. I haven't been able to put it down. I may say I m very cheep, this game is air tempting me to buy upgrades. I know I will. Great, great , great. Free or  for purchase I love it. All of my friends will know about it when I'm done. Thanks for a job well done
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|***** 11/19/2014 update *****  Since my original review, Chromecast has expanded its offerings.  Still no Amazon video, but that isn't the fault of Chromecast.  Since then, I've been able to cast my screen from a Nexus 4 and 7.  This is a great feature, which eliminates the need for any miracast receiver.    Like  ----  1. Easy to use, easy to transport to other locations.  2. Navigation is simplified using a phone/tablet.  3. Works fine with iOS and Android.  4. Screen casting from Android devices is great.  5. Casting from within applications/webpages is prevalent, but we don't use that much.    Dislikes  --------  1. Have to use phone/tablet for navigation.  Sometimes we wish for a simple remote.  2. iOS loses sync, app has to be restarted on the device.  Luckily, we don't have to reboot the Chromecast (most of the time).  3. Is this going to be another Google dodo?  E.g. Nexus Q, Google TV?  Will support continue with the introduction of Android TV?    I have also ordered two Amazon Fire TV sticks to see how they compare with the Chromecast.  I should have a review comparing the two shortly.      ***** Original review *****  The early Chromecast orders were more appealing because of the 3-months of Netflix included.  I use it regularly to watch YouTube and Netflix on my TV in the family room.  The picture quality is better than Netflix through my Roku XD (first gen).  Occasionally, it loses sync with my phone or tablet (both Android).  It has been reasonably easy to get it back in sync though (usually restarting the Chromecast app on the phone/tablet, and restarting Netflix/YouTube).    I see great potential for this devices, and devices like it.  I like the idea of keeping the \\"smarts\\" in one devices, and other devices (like Chromecast) are essentially receivers.    Even with the minor flaws, the pricepoint makes it a must have for anyone with a TV with HDMI.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Probably the most intense, exciting, and drama filled book of the series. Unbelievable, couldn't put this one down. Wow, just wow.
1476727651|4.0|In Doctor Sleep, Stephen King finally answers our questions about what happened to Danny, that creepy little boy  from The Shining.  Being tagged as a sequel, Doctor Sleep really stands on its own and you won't be entirely lost if you haven't read The Shining. Notice I said READ The Shining, not watched the movie.<br /><br />Basically, Danny is grown up, battling alcoholism thanks to AA, and working in a hospice. The title comes from his ability to help patients pass on when they are ready to go. When a young girl named Abra, who also has the shining, begins speaking to him inside his head, a unique friendship surfaces. And just in time too! Abra is in danger. A group of vampire-like RV folk, calling themselves the True Knot, who feed off \\"the steam\\" of children who have the shining are hunting her.<br /><br />Though this book, ringing in at just over 500 pages, isn't as big as some of his other lofty tomes, it certainly feels like that when you read it. Having read almost every King book, being a fan since high school, I remember the days when his books really did terrify me and keep me thinking about them at night.<br /><br />Today King focuses more on the individual and their inner demons than he does his villains, hence all the talk here about AA with Danny which goes on and on. Rose The Hat, the leader of the True Knot, and her gang of ruffians just wasn't scary to me. And at times when you think King is going to take you to the edge, he leaves you hanging and having to imagine the horrific details on your own. Sometimes not having the details spoon fed to you is equally terrifying, but not here. So, overall, those wanting to read something from the \\"King of Horror\\" will be disappointed.<br /><br />Notice I'm still giving this book 4 stars. The lack of the scary elements which put King on the map doesn't make this a bad book. King can still write good dialogue and create good characterization. I didn't want to put the book down, and I was quite satisfied after having finished it, already wondering what he's working on next. There's a good story here with likable characters that you are sure to remember. But those expecting to be kept awake at night because you are scared, let's just say you'll just be awake for just wanting to find out what happens next. Otherwise, it's okay to turn the lights off and go to sleep.having finished it, already wondering what he's working on next.

B002C949KE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it explains our own irrational behavior and backs it up with some great experiments and concise conclusions to the results. I would recommend it to anyone interested in human behavior, economics, or if you just want a really fascinating read!
0525478817|4.0|Has everyone come to the same realization but some are better at forgetting - or pretending not to know - than others. This book will remind you how wonderful life is.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it and very well might read again. I have also recommended it to a number of my friendd
B00002N9ER|5.0|These brackets have a very tight grip on the flashlight.  Hold it very securely.  I would use them again.  Easy to install.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a great game.It's so addicting.I love this game so much.I'm obsessed with minions and I'm going to be a minion for Halloween and I have minions and I'm so excited to see Despicable me 2.(:
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Haunting glimpse into a bleak future for mankind. I chose this book honestly, just by the sheer number of positive reviews. I was not disappointed. The story is a very different view of post apocalypse fiction based on the preservation of the human animal.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I enjoyed the book alot and the way Rick  Riordan made his letter seem as if the stories where real
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Good graphics and effects, but the story could have been better. Its like he took a short trip to earth for nothing.
B00F88H5K2|5.0|Gays in relationships encounter the same issues as other folks. I was glad to be able to see into this side of a world I do not know about.
B008GOG98Y|1.0|This movie is rated PG. It should be rated R for the language. Stupid movie. I wish Amazon gave refunds for bad movies. This one would qualify.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I saw the recommendation to read this book from an list I am part of. I am glad I took up the recommendation. It is readable and practical yet provides depth to cause contemplation. I can't recommend this book enough!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I had expected it to broadcast everything from my Chrome browser, but it does not seem to do so.<br /><br />It is very easy, however, to set up for broadcasting YouTube and Netflix streaming videos from my smartphone.<br /><br />I would say it is worth the $35 I paid.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I enjoy this app...it gives me daily updates for my chosen blogs..and then I can mark them all az read so I only get the new posts each day
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was a compelling page turner that made me want more and more as the story progressed. It's fast paced but the story is perfectly told through Sabriel's journey. One of the best books I've read and one of the best in it's genre. I'm glad I picked it up.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Overall the Hail-Fire is fantastic. If you want 144 darts, you are going to have to get all 8 of the 18 dart clips. Only one 18-dart clip comes with the Hail-Fire, the rest you have to buy. The rest of the clips you get hold 6 darts. Even then 54 darts come with the Hail-Fire and that's still a lot of darts. So it is still an impressive arsenal.<br /><br />Pros: Semi-automatic fire, dart capacity, the Hail-Fire comes with a strap to hold extra darts and clips, a range of 75 feet just like any other Elite. It does have a handle, so lifting it is no problem.<br /><br />Cons: It takes forever to reload (but as long as you have extra clips and use your darts wisely, you will be fine). It jams occasionally but not too often. It's not very mobile (but it has such superior firepower, you don't need to move to often). It's battery might die in battle leaving you helpless (so I would advise a backup weapon). The battery's hum will give you away during an ambush (but as long as you turn on the battery right before you fire you can still launch an effective surprise attack.<br /><br />There are a lot of drawbacks to this weapon, but I think once you overcome them, the weapon is extremely brutal and the pros are much better than the cons in my opinion. So overall I give this Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire Blaster 4 stars.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Wow - this has to be one if the all time bombs of recent memory.<br /><br />Goofy plot, stupid ending, and good actors out in bad roles.<br /><br />You have been warned!
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|This is, to me, the definitive version of one of the greatest rock albums of our time. Buy it. I have the CD, as well, and I have it on my phone, computer, etc. While you can't go wrong in any format there is NOTHING like listening to &#34;I Appear Missing&#34; on vinyl. Wow. Thank you, Josh Homme.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I am enjoying this game so far. However there is 1 thing that is annoying. There is no cancel button for actions. I accidentally upgraded an item &amp; couldn't stop it. Please add a cancel button.<br />Even this review has a cancel button.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game! It has some problems, it glitches a lot, and I have tried numerous times to buy credits so I could play more but they never show up! I have to call amazon to get my money back, which sucks!!!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Lots of fun and can be tricky at times. Great way to pass the time. Makes you think. Does not make you not think.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|Doesn't show humidity.  Has to be reset ever day.. Ugh or low temperature don't match when they should be the same.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|When you go to see an optometrist for an eye test, they show you the same set of letters, and get you to look at them through many different lenses. Hosseini brings this approach to the book with the key characters seen through the lenses of different people. This approach, of viewing people's character and actions through the perspective of various people, adds interest and complexity. I have to add that Hosseini does not make it easy for the reader sometimes. It does require the reader to work hard at piecing together the jigsaw puzzle that he has created. However, it is well worth the effort and investment.<br /><br />Hosseini has such an incredible knack to create real and complex characters in vivid colour. The novel centres on the relationship between two siblings (Abdullah and Pari) who were separated as children. We follow the lives of these complex characters, and the multi-generational ramifications of their father's life choice. Early into the novel Hosseini introduces two other siblings - the children's stepmother Parwana and her disabled sister Masooma. He reveals their true selves, including their most shameful secrets, but leaves you to be the judge of their difficult lives and choices. We find out that Abdullah and Pari's separation came about because their uncle (Nabi) was manipulating behind the scenes. Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man in Kabul, and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple. We follow Nabi's path, and the complicated love triangle between him, Mr Wahdati, and Nila. When Nila leaves her husband and takes Pari with her to go back to Europe, we know that its going to be very difficult for the siblings to ever find each other.<br /><br />It was always in the back of my mind that the siblings must be reunited one day, or that some kind of closure must be reached. There are no Hollywood endings in this book, butthe sometimes heartbreaking life paths of the characters ring true, and the ending is worth waiting for.
B0000067L2|5.0|In My estimation, the greatest rock band ever. Sunshine, White Room etc. Wonderful, Baker works like a metronome, Bruce gives his heart, and Clapton is Clapton.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|A classic.  What else can one say but great classic by pink Floyd  with Money being my best off all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not many books have me highlighting excerpts like this one did. Moving. Reflective. Emotional. A must read, regardless of age.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Could not even finish!! Made it more than half way and realized it was a waste of my time. Not enough character development and it was a very SLOW read.Too bad, I had high hopes.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I've gone through all the levels but it will take a long time to get through the achievements. It's really hard to put down!
140006922X|2.0|I read a similar book,\\" The jews in the time of Jesus\\" and that one brings much more to the table than this so called best seller. I wonder whether Aslan would have the guts to make a similar research  and publish a book like this about his own religion and prophet; I really  don't think so! In case he does it would probably have his own agenda as this one has. He is so eager to use science to rationalize Jesus's miracles that I would love to see how he would use science and historical facts to proof his own faith.<br />Apart from Aslan's vision of  Jesus, primarily based on his own assumptions, the other historical characters and places are worthy to read about; even though some of  it also contradicts to other history teachings I had access to.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0809136104 The Jews in the Time of Jesus: An Introduction]]
B008Y212PI|5.0|This was a very enjoyable game. I wish it lasted longer and had more puzzle. I don't like that it can't be played in airplane mode.
015204907X|5.0|This is a great book for showing opposites...I love the rhythm  and illustrations..Children learn quickly to &#34;read&#34; this one themselves.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I expected less but got more! I love books I cannot put down!! I would recommend for those with an open mind with the thought that anyone can be worthy of love - even Elena...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story is rich with history, the costumes are glorious and the acting fantastic.  It really transports you while watching.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|good product for shar your youtube and your files and you like to watch from TV ,  i will buy again<br /><br />Thank you Amazon
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I like this book as much as the other four of this series of novels.  George Martin has a way of writing in circles, with the later books hanging around to meet up with his previous book chronologies, which take a certain talent in a writer to pull off well.  Ice and fire will go on for a while yet, as George is still formulating this tale in his head as he goes on with it.  Not that he is likely to be stressed much, to be able to come up with more intrigueing tales to spin, as he completes the work he has begun here, but rather more like data input into a computer program that combines like proofs to complete a theorm or postulation to lay down his own evolution of his imagination.  He does it so well that those of us reading his works anxiously await his outcomes with anticipation that I am sure followed JRR Tolkien's first works of the last century, as the turmoil of Europe gripped the readers he nurtured along after his Triology.  Patience and wait for the next one to come out.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this show! Great characters, beautiful scenery, and the fact that it's free with Amazon Prime just makes it that much better!
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|I recently saw Saxon play in Montreal and while I was a big fan of their earlier stuff, did not, I'm ashamed to admit, own this album. They played a few songs from Sacrifice and I was impressed. I ordered the album as soon as I got home and think it's great. It has a heavier sound than the more rocking tunes of the 80s, but everything is very solid and there are some real standouts, such as Sacrifice, Wheels of Terror, and Made in Belfast.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, give it a try. I think you'll like it.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Does what it should. Lovely widget. Accurate forecast. And nicely translated to Lithuanian!<br />Still, the smaller widget could be adjustable in size.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Love this movie, watched with my wife... was a great weekend watch, and great for people and kids of all ages.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I have enjoyed this series on Sherlock Holmes so much, that I find myself watching each one over and over again. Really wonderful!
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I have now bought 4 anker portable back up chargers for me and my family... they work great are very portable and I am now never the guy begging for an outlet in a restaurant.  The 6000 is enough to charge my phone 2.5 times with no problem.  Love these products at a great price.  All phones with micro usb don't need a separate cable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love bingo this is the best real time bingo game...enjoying it. Tournament are hard to win but a great way yo build up coins o<br />r chips. Free spins everyday. Also build power ups bingo chips and coins.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|You are the chef of your own restaurant. You get to customize the setup, decorations, the number of seats you have, basically everything. You can make friends, check on them, send and receive gifts, and do much more. I gave this game five stars for it's ability to keep you entertained for hours on end. You do need internet for this though, and that it really a one of this games major flaws. I highly recommend this game and think that you should get it.
1455883115|5.0|Pinker is a pretty heavy-duty author writing on some pretty heavy-duty subjects and I'm somewhat of a dilettante who has difficulty delving into weightier discourse on anthropology, linguistics, etc.  but I enjoy spoon-feeding myself the intellectual spinach with CDs for the car.  Pinker is an awesome writer, who is accessible most of the time and this subject has really changed my perspective about modern living and the state of the world today.  Gives me hope, gives me hope.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I love this game, but it doesn't want to connect to facebook so you can send and receive requests,etc... I hope they fix this problem.
B00F2362IE|4.0|My 6 year old grandson plays this game and likes it pretty well. The only thing that happens to be the problem is the game freezes up on him sometimes. Other than that he doesn't complain and seems to like it a lot.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app was flawless for months...but one day it logged me out and now i cant get back in<br /><br />I log in loading....loading...loading just wont let me in
1619698463|5.0|I am gluten-sensitive and have been avoiding it.  After reading Grain Brain, I now understand that I still was eating too many healthy carbs.  I have reduced the amount of carbs and have started losing weight beyond the point I didn't think I would get past previously.  But just as importantly, I understand better why I would react to too many sugars, and why I would feel faint trying to eat a vegetarian diet.  I have recommended this book to as many people as possible, and gave a copy of it to my daughter and son-in-law.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like this game it's like being there hunting someday I will be out there hunting with my brother and sister.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|BEST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ IN A VERY LONG TIME.  KEPT ME INTERESTED AND I LEARNED A LOT FROML THIS BOOK.  IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY GRANDAUGHTER WHO ALSO ENJOYED IT AND CRIED HER EYES OUT.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is by far the BEST product for TV. Amazon, if you were NOT SCARED, you would have CONTINUED TO SELL IT!  BETTER THAN THE AMAZON FIRE OR ROKU  This is a whole different level.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|Good read and well-written.  The simple lifestyles of the characters were a nice respite from the daily stresses of life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun the only reason why someone would rate this 1 star if they don't know how to play
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|Have this on VHS but just packed it away and thought well I wont get to watch this anymore, then saw this deal and couldnt resist getting it. A special 2-4 offer too check it out.
B0014NDXGA|4.0|I like the product but having problem locking onto correct distance don't know if it's me oe the range finder
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Smartly written with a comfortable flow.  Interesting story details and character backgrounds<br /> that make you not want to put it down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a very good book but has very mature parts. You should not read it if you don't like violence!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!!! This is the most realistic horse game I have ever played!! Its fun for any age!!!!
B003VPWX6K|5.0|This book is a masterpiece on several levels.<br />First, and this would be enough to place it at the top of any list, is the beauty of the written language, the richness of expression, the way the characters spring out of the page by means of their dialog and actions. Masterly depicted.<br />But this is only the surface. What lays behind is where the author achieves his mastery.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />What makes the book interesting is the role of the main character as the unreliable narrator. The narrator tells the story with such a wealth of information, that the readers can't help but thinking they are given the whole picture, the deep truth. However, as they proceed reading, they realize, as the narrator himself does, that what seemed a story with a solid foundation was in reality a shaky narration and the narrator was unable to see the truth about his master and about his relationships.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|If you like Si-Fi this is a must see even if you do not like Tom Cruise.  I can't think of anything I didn't like about it.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|This was an extremely boring and painful book to read.  I couldn't wait for it to end and the only reason I finished it was because I paid money for it.  My advice?  Don't waste your time or money on this book!  I was expecting it<br />to be so much better!
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Great actors, They should make a remake of this movie, it would be so great.  So much could be added to it, would love to go to Westworld if their was one.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|This is very timely.  Although I received this at the same time as the Star Trek Original Series set, I had been busy watching the first two seasons of that for the last few weeks and decided to take a John Wayne break before starting Season Three so just last night watched &#34;El Dorado.&#34;  I cannot believe I had never seen it before or at least I did not remember any of it though I thought I had seen it long ago on t.v.  I have a pretty nice collection of John Wayne movies,  and I had heard that &#34;El Dorado&#34; was kind of a re-make of my longtime favorite &#34;Rio Bravo.&#34;  Although there were plenty of differences, there were also many parallels.  I thought John Wayne was much the same in both, but Robert Mitchum and James Caan were better than Dean Martin and Rick Nelson, it seemed to me , or their parts were bigger anyway.  I have watched &#34;Rio Bravo&#34; many times so I always know what is going to happen next, but with &#34;El Dorado&#34; everything was a surprise, which was fun.  It will also be fun to watch again, hopefully many times as well.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I rented Oblivion twice. Both times, I fell asleep during the movie and during the first rental, I waited too long to resume watching before my rental period expired. So what made me rent it a second time? I thought surely the movie would get better as time went by if I had remained awake. Sadly, it didn't.<br />I won't review the premise of the story. There are several other reviewers who have done a much better job with that than I could ever do. What I am going to tell you, should you care to read further is that I rarely rate a review. I may rate a movie with the &#34;star&#34; system but I have done this only rarely. In fact, the last movie I felt compelled to express my two cents about was &#34;Legends of the Fall&#34; if that tells you anything. And for some reason, I find myself comparing these two movies over and over again although the stories at first glance could hardly be more alike.<br /><br />Both movies have incredible cinematography whether it be showcasing real nature and it's amazing, jaw dropping beauty in &#34;Legends of the Fall&#34; which was filmed with such an incredible eye for detail that took your breath away as only Kevin Costner's films, &#34;Dances with Wolves&#34; or &#34;Open Range&#34; have done for me since or the talented mix of the sparse but visually compelling landscape of parts of Iceland with the special CGI effects mixed in that are showcased in this movie.<br /><br />Both movies also showcase the equally gorgeous actors, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise who in and of themselves are equally pleasing to look at if only they had exercised some of their acting skills in either movie to offer us an enjoyable movie for other reasons than just the scenery. In each movie, the main characters acted by the above mentioned artists are acted which such stoicism despite the journeys their characters take that good looks aside, it makes the movies hard to watch for any other reason other than the total visual appeal. If not for their costars ineach movie there would be no redeeming acting value.<br /><br />If you like CGI effects for the scenery, you will enjoy this movie. If you're looking for something to entertain you otherwise, do yourself a favor: skip this one!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME. LOTS TO DO. LOTS OF WAYS TO EARN POINTS. PLAYED FOR A FEW HOURS. A lot of fun even for adults.
B008Y212PI|4.0|pretty good game overall.  some pretty easy, some fairly difficult. got it as faotd.having the puzzles each be items from the pictures was an interesting twist.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Would like to know when Kindle Fire version for Minion Rush will be updated? Seems that we always get updated last or will never be updated!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was great - so inspired I am going to follow through. So many good points, I have to lean in now!
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love having all the different translations. It makes studying the Bible a lot more fun and exciting. Easy to use.
0547848412|4.0|Having never seen the movie,  the story was completely new to me. The whole story of survival from a child's perspective was quite interesting. The pace flowed and the language stayed engaging.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Simple, yet addicting. Most puzzles are intuitive.  If not there are hints. You can walk away and just come back.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I decided to read this book and do each exercise one at a time until I succeeded.  I found what I put out seemed to take about 4 days to manifest so with practise who knows what will happen??
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. Stephen King is like a fine wine. He gets better and better with age. This book had me hooked from the very beginning. I didn't want to put it down. There was never a point where I felt like he was rambling on like he sometimes does with too much detail.  Each chapter draws you in deeper and deeper into the story and into its characters.  This is by far one of my favorites of his. A great read. Can't wait to read it again.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have always been fasinated with Near Death Experiences as I have observed myself in a hospital bed.  I also, like Anita had not &#34;died&#34; but was very near too it.  Once this has happened life is never the same.  Mind does cause dis-ease, it is a pity not people understand and acknowledge this.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This is my preferred weather app. It is muc quicker and cleaner than accuweather. I really like it a lot.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is almost the first self help book written - and it proves that when a message is entwined in a story the message is far more likely to stick. Age and time does not change the message
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is a fast paced book that explores all sorts of scientific possibilities. It takes you into a ride into the future. Fascinating!!!!
1401924751|5.0|I love these cards - and no matter what the situation - or who the person is reading the cards - they always come up trumpts....
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Ok. The Last Airbender was truly an awful movie. Starting out with a director that has lost his mojo. I knew this was going to be a vehicle for Jaden Smith. A vehicle that would allow him to pout a lot. And, yet, with all this information I gave my $4.99 to Amazon to rent this movie.<br /><br />Slow paced. Poor dialogue. Poor special effects (a mutant Earth that will kill you and the best you can come up with are some baboons and a really big overprotective bird?). An alien civilization creating a creature to destroy us, but.., heck, let's make it blind. In fact, if you aren't afraid of the creature it will never find you. Non-existent directing. And, silly character names - Sypher Raige?  The best performance of the movie came from the dead girl (Thanks, Zoe).<br /><br />It won't be the last time that I rent a bad movie, but..., If you are like me and give a lot of science fiction movies the benefit of the doubt reconsider before you divest yourself to view this one. Go to Starbucks and get a nice cup of coffee with the money. It'll give you more satisfaction over a longer extended period of time than this very awkward movie.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Will make a great movie but not great writing. Always hard for me to see so many typos. Who edits this stuff?

B00514HDNW|5.0|I liked this short story.  Imagine being the last human on earth and everyone wants to eat you.  I love the vampires in this book.  They remind me of zombies but yet they are vampires.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Easy and accessible read. It demystified the process of a genius without taking away the joy and curiosity that surrounds minds like Tesla's.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is full of suspense with many twists and turns! Can't wait to read the next one.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Well written.  Not sure what to think of it.  Seems to have drawn a future that I would never live to see.  Not sure how thought provoking this story is. I recommend it if you are looking for an adventurous challenge.
B00ERWZYX0|5.0|My 9-year old granddaughter pronounced it as great; she called me at 10 p.m. at night to thank me for such a great present!  That is 5-star in itself.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|The bonus features and cast commentary were well worth what I paid. Can't get enough. I love owning Dr. Horrible rather than searching online for it
B008UG0JJI|5.0|The performance of the trio has to be heard to be believed.  Looking forward to more DVDs of her playing
B006O5YHUY|5.0|I have watched this movie 5 times, love it every time. The family aspect, the brotherly aspect, the brothers in arms camaraderie are all things I can relate to. The soundtrack is fantastic as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a very easy read and almost all action. It had a fast pace that kept me turning the &#34;pages&#34; all the way through the surprise ending.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|The previous ones were funnier. It did end well. I expected a little more from it based on the previous ones.
B000UNYK3A|5.0|When it comes to horror films, or any film for that matter, I always look forward to the director's cut. Hostel was advertised as the sickest, most twisted and scariest horror film to be made in the last 10 years. However, I wondered how all this could be packaged into an R-Rated film (you can thank the MPAA for that bit of confusion).<br /><br /> After its release, people either praised or absolutely hated the film and Eli Roth's filmmaking abilities. Being the curious writer that I am, I wanted to get it straight from the source: Eli Roth and those involved in the making of \\"Hostel.\\" And thanks to DVD, I can.<br /><br /> \\"Hostel: Director's Cut\\" is very in depth. The three commentaries alone give so many views on how the film came to be and what it was like during production. What I found in Roth in his solo commentary was his passion for the genre. He gives advice directly to the film student and shares his own success story of how he made it in the business. Also, Roth explains how the idea for \\"Hostel\\" came about (And you know what? The concept of wanting to know what it would be like to kill somebody and then pay for that experience is a pretty twisted idea).<br /><br />A nice bonus that was not available in the original \\"Hostel\\" DVD release is a radio interview with Roth, an Icelandic meal with actor Eythor Gudjonsson and an interview with Takashi Miike (and if you want to see some wicked stuff, Audition and Visitor Q are on Miike's resume).<br /><br /> On the first disc is a three-part feature (shot by Eli's brother, Gabriel) that takes you through the making of the film, from the last-minute frantic casting to the premier in Iceland. Two separate treats are the multi-angle look at the \\"Kill the Car\\" scene (once again, a gift to film students) and the mini doc on the makeup masterminds Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger of KNB EFX Group.<br /><br /> This DVD is generous, and not in just how much there is. This is a DVD for aspiring filmmakers of all genres to have in their collection. You get a great, modern horror flick (yes, I'm one of those who liked the film) and a look at the talented people behind it.
055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Swords is a monstrous chapter in the Game of Thrones series.  Continues where Book two left off and covers a more expansive story than either of the previous two.  Was the first book in a long time to bring tears after a particularly tragic scene.  Lots of ups and downs that will punch you where it hurts but it's well written and hard to put down.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|It is a nice book, I fell warm when I closed the book.<br />Thanks your work. It make my day.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|This high energy effort from Panic is incredible.  I loved the last CD but this one is even better.  I got the Target Deluxe Version and the two additional songs are on point (and worth the drive).  If you want an uplifting and fun cd pick this up.
B00C7607BC|1.0|I was just about to see this Bluray version for the third time and my Bluray said not able to read disk. Amazing shouldn't be selling bootlegged movies! This is ridiculous. I bought a bunch of movies aside to this and I'm scared to open them up. I'm super disappointed! Waste of my money!

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Well Bowie... how could one not like it? By the way, it would be a nice idea if you (Amazon) were to insist that receipts for tax purposes be included with every purchase.
B00FN811SY|5.0|A comparative Bible translation - easy to use, beautiful to look at, and thoroughly accurate.  Only the people serving the True God today could produce such a masterful, clear, and concise rendering of holy scripture.  I have waited a long time to see a Bible like this, and my wait is finally over!  Highly recommended for anyone interested in knowing what the Bible really says, in unbiased language, and in comparison with other highly-regarded translations.  I will treasure this app like no other.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This book had a really slow start because I didn't know what was going on  and didn't have a connection to the characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the greatest product /app in the the greatest Amazon app ever.so I would highly recommend this app to download and also play.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Cant wait for the third season . This is the best series that I have ever watched. Once you start watching you cant stop.
B000002H5I|5.0|This is the best!  I really can't stop listening to it.  In the morning it's soothing before I commute to work.  In the evening it gives me something think about while winding down from the days events.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|good game. got some different guns. areas are different. put together really good to. good job, nowim addict to another good game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I am so adicided to this game I can't stop playing it . I love all the guns and animals and upgrades that this game has in it
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be available on the Kindle for awhile now. High replay value! My only complaint is the need for additional maps
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|Good for kids and all,but a lot of stuff is locked no very fun it's like 4$ for the hole game.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I saw a Friend playing this I bought and it is the best game I have and I love how realistic it is
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, my sister plays this game, my coworkers play this game, I highly recommended this app and the dragons are so cute!
B0093QHWLC|5.0|Very good movie,  but like most  if you have read the book, you will notice the movie can only do so much in the time frame.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a semi-retired school teacher who works as a substitute for three school districts and I also give piano lessons.  When I heard about this app, I decided to get it and try it.  I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />It has a calendar that can be manipulated to suit your own preferences.  You can protect it with a password and archive the  notes.  I use a different color for each school district I work with, and I can put the dates and work numbers on the notes as well as mark them on the calendar.  It also has the &#34;online sync&#34; capability.  I use the notes for different topics and organize them any way that works for me.  You can also back them up on the SD card on your smart phone.<br /><br />I appreciate its flexible nature which you can tweak to suit your own style.  It's an enjoyable, fun and most important -- practical.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|Another knitting reference book that will help both old and new knitters. Easy to understand with so much information to keep you knitting, knitting, knitting....
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|... but you won't find the Borg shopping at Ikea. This is another great Star Trek movie that is essentially a long episode from &#34;The Next Generation&#34; series. There's no point in telling you about the plot, but any fan of Star Trek will definitely enjoy this movie!
B00C2UUPQA|5.0|Roger Bushell, the man who led the Great Escape, comes vividly to life in this  first biography written about him.  Simon Pearson,making use of the newly available Bushell family papers and just about every other imaginable source material, paints a portrait of an exuberant, arrogant and courageous soul who lived to defy authority.  Such defiance was mostly fun and games in a prewar life that saw Bushell lucky in skiing and lawyering but unlucky in love.  It took on a deeper and grimmer meaning in the crucible of WWII RAF and POW life, and indeed it cost Bushell his life just when it seemed that he and his lost love would reunite after the war.  This book presents a Roger Bushell that none of the other books could.  (It also makes Guy Walters' portrayal of Bushell as a heedless egomaniac in his otherwise excellent recent book The Real Great Escape look willfully cavalier and one sided.)  For anyone interested in the Great Escape, it is essential reading.
0812993292|5.0|I loved this book and have gotten two copies for friends.  A great story that deals with real life experiences.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very entertaining! Lots of action and little bit of everything else too! I watched this for 3 times now :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is an enjoyable game to play.  Im sure this is not a true Mahjong but it meets my needs.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|If you like scarey, violent and quick to the point, you'll like Dredd. It started off downright violent and continued to the end. I grew to like it a bit more when the star of the show was &#34;Judge, Jury, and Trial&#34; all rolled up into one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was well written. I'm now on my third Gillian Flynn book and want to read more from this author.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Love all the Marvel movies. This was another great show. Really liked the fact that Captain American didn't have super-human powers unlike the other Marvel movies. But, did have All-American powers! I'd watch again.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I was really engrossed with the games.  The individual games were quite a challenge yet fun.  I found them to be  very engaging.<br /> Yet  not<br />At all scary.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|AWSOME!!!!!  at first it looked ...  well...  blah. but I played it and it the best game ever!!  I also recommend. WONDER ZOO<br />-
B0012FHGCW|3.0|It stinks that it is stuck on amazon and can be burned to a separate disk.Although great price and awesome movie.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I get to see animals you see in real life I love mlp and lps. I love mlp. my fab is apple jack.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Why don't they make Candy Crush Saga for kindle fire?<br />I want the game so bad so I can play it and have something to do when I am bored.Very good game too!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|this is an great show! I enjoyed it so much and would recommend it to my friend. Even better with prime!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Still Alice, was so real to me, because I work with two elderly people, who are not aware of a conversation that took place five minutes before, at my age E.A.  is always a scary thing that could be lerking around the next corner...Larry
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Interesting documentary on dating via social networking. I especially liked it when Nev requested to stop the filming process when he started to figure-out something wasn't quite right...
0385528787|5.0|I stayed awake all night so I could finish this book and I also couldn't put it down! This book is, for me, about human nature and what we will do and how far we will go to survive. It is also about the extinction of the human race and the animal world. When I first read Oryx and Crake, (first in the trilogy) I couldn't look at the world in the same way, and MaddAddam has done this to me again! I love this book, and this trilogy so much. I think everyone should read this book as it is such important book that needs to be read. Thank you Margaret Atwood for giving us such an amazing journey with these books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Top quality program season after season!  Can't wait for Season 4 on television now that I am caught up with the rest of the fans!
B00371XIJE|5.0|I was very touched by this story.  The story shows the devotion we have for our beloved pets and their unconditional love for us!  I loved the movie and thought to the day when I will see my pets again that have gone on to what now is called the Rainbow Bridge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A must play game... Once you start,  you will never stop! I 'vebeen playing for many months and still haven't gotten board at all with this game. So download and play now with your friends! Good luck and have fun!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Another very good series with good story lines, great actors who have fine acting skills.  I have loved it and been hooked from the very first episode.
0823013626|5.0|I love this book! I fell in love w/i this book 3 years ago in a well-known bookstore, where it was priced out of my reach, then. When I finally had a little more money, I thought to go to Amazon for the book, and got it so inexpensively that a friend asked to get a second copy for her. The book has basic information for beginners as well as the incredible 'special effects&#34; this author is known for,and she gives detailed step-by-steps that are beautifully illustrated. Can't be beat. Love it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Right from the very first episode/pilot, this series grabbed me and has held me throughout.  It has great scripts, great acting, story line is fantastic, and I love the courst room dramas, and the stars all fit their rolls.
0425252868|5.0|It is a story that gives you shivers down your spine. I grew up in Germany during World  War II and this story of chivalry during the most horrible war, made me so very proud. Great and beautiful story.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This was one of my favorite King novels in many years.  My favorite novels from Stephen King came from his early work with a couple of exceptions.  Black House and Dr. Sleep have joined Salem's Lot, The Stand, The Shining, Firestarter and The Talisman on my Stephen King favorites list.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought it petered out a little rather than building through the end.  But this is well worth your time and I'm happy to find another novel to love from the author that first hooked me on reading.
B005LAIII0|4.0|The cinematic effect is excellent, but in the end, it's mostly about a boy and a tiger on a boat deserted on the open sea. It's a bit boring at times.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I am happy with the ability to make notes, I have not tried yet to do more than this yet
B007REV4YI|5.0|Ever since I bought this movie, I've watched it more than once. It's action packed and full of suspense. 007 is on a mission to save Britain's best from being destroyed.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Best mix of today and 2100 years ago. Can't wait to read book two. Kindling it now! Atticus lives forever!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I love this movie. The plots were great and the acting was superb. There's non-stop action and the suspense would keep you at the edge of your seat.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|In the last few years every new studio album released by Elton John has been hailed by both critics and fans as his best work in decades. The Diving Board has done exactly that, even surpassing it's recent predecessors! It's been well documented that Elton had a lot of time to live with the finished body of work and had returned to studio to improve upon it. This payed off as we are left with an outstanding body of music!<br /><br />The star tracks are the bluesy country flavoured Can't Stay Alone Tonight; the previous title track Voyeur, of which could easily have been released as a single with it's beautiful harmonies and unique bass section; and The New Fever Waltz with it's somber tune and piano keys reminiscent of Carla Etude. The songs are all a very beautiful and melodic that cross a range of genre from piano rock and roll, blues, country and jazz . This mixed bag of genres are married together by three short instrumentals that divide the album and gives the listener a break before the next selection plays.<br /><br />Of all the versions out there, I prefer the double cd with all the bonus material on the second disc as I find it demanding to listen to a lengthy album with numerous songs.<br /><br />The piano, drums and bass themed album is well structured and Elton John reminds us what a great musician and artist he is by stripping down the music to show it has substance.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie drags a little long for me in introducing each Avenger characters in the beginning. The real action happens only toward 2/3 of the movie. But it was a fun movie to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|good game.. no great game but needs redstone and pressure plates and also needs to be able to spawn monsters in creative and needs to get dark in creative
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This movie is great with some lighter side to it. Some parts of the movie are difficult to believe, but overall if you like Tom Cruise's movies, you'll most likely like this one too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So glad to have this on my phone when I don't have my Kindle with me! Easy to use too.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|I've seen this movie several times already but decided to purchase the blu ray for my collection because the action is non-stop and the cinematic effect keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat.
1455523550|5.0|This was a wonderful story, definitely worth the read, and I would recommend this to people who enjoy reading romantic books.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I am a big fan of apocalyptic visions. Not so much where humanity is under violent attack or where crazed zombies or aliens are killing us in mass quantities. I enjoy the vision where the world has dramatically changed and humanity has to deal with a world so different, we have to stretch mentally to just understand. Pines did that for me. Once we knew it's secrets, all I could do say was...WOW. I really enjoyed this book and for fans of apocalyptic novels, get ready for a neck of a ride.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's ok but it freezes a lot. But it is good for people with no phone and likes to text.
0399159347|5.0|HOW can an author know her characters, which are all so different with so many layers, with such adept precision. THIS book tore my heart out and then put it back with the hands of a surgeon.  Reading these intertwined stories left me breathless, right up to the last few pages.  This was my first ebook purchase and though I hated it, I love to touch  the pages with my fingertips, see how far I have left and how much I've read., inhale the scent of books, etc.  I know, I'm obsolete.  I highly recommend this book, but buy the book. You'll want to send this gem on to other book lovers.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Love story, adventure, parable on being human in a state driven by ideology, where survival depends on maintaining a separate and secret identity.  Who knows if this is a true reflection of human relations in North Korea?  But it is compelling.<br />A great read, even standing in the subway.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Love Love Love this amplifier! I watch movies at the gym and couldnt hear low talking over the noise of the gym.<br />So much better I love this thing so much.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I started watching the show only to discover it is based on a true story and book. Usually I like the book better but not in this case.  The show has a lot more drama and in depth characters.
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|Okay, so I've been avoiding this one for a long time as I'm not much of a hype follower.  But on a whim (stuck on a train and just finished a book on my Kindle) this popped up as suggested reading and I figured I'd give it a shot.  I'm really glad I did.  The narrative style took a bit of getting used to, but overall this was a highly enjoyable read.  I'm now reading the sequel, so that's saying a lot!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book series is phenomenal! I can't put it down once I start. It's so well written and it flows right along too!
B004T340QY|5.0|I saw the first half of the movie in prison.  I didn't have a television, so I had to look over the shoulder of other inmates in order to look at the movie on their television.  I was freed from prison and could not wait to rent the movie so I could enjoy the full movie in the privacy of my own home.  I loved it.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|It is a nice reading, amuses and entertains. Although it is not amazing, I liked it.<br /><br />But ...<br /><br />The book takes a while to get involved, it is difficult for us to identify ourselves with the main character's drama.<br /><br />But as the book gets down, the story becomes more engaging, even if the characters do not. The plot is very creative, has a different perspective, involving science and politics (with high levels of fantasy, of course) as a way to to control the people, and the world.<br /><br />The protagonist is on several occasions boring and repetitive, selfish to the extreme, always repeating the same mistakes. She takes a lot ot time to learn. The story goes on with teenagers, and the author captures the immaturity of them. Maybe the problem is if the one who is reading is an adult and do not feel part of the drama.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|This movie was awesome. I really liked it. I hope they make more of these movies it was a great idea with many great ideas in it but doesn't take charge of anything. Loved it. Worth every penny.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked this book. I was unaware of the orphan trains. It was very enjoyable reading and the characters were well defined
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Good read. A bit predictable but enjoyable.makes you think about if you really know what you would do in situation that becomes about preservation
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Wow! Is just about all I can say about this app.  I can shop all day from anywhere and how cool is that!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Their worst album ever, too derogatory, too sexist and always mentioning something of alcohol in various songs. It became apparent that this album was going nowhere for me. The first two songs were good then it just tailed off. Where is the band who released the previous 4 albums that were Metal and steered away from mentioning any other theme that wasn't related to sex like the last 2 albums. This album for me is their worst, even Curb is better!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the coolest horse game around.the best thing is is that it's free. Please try this game. I really enjoyed this game and I know you will to
B0002IU988|5.0|When I first heard of them it was in VH1 at 5:30am when they actually used to give music videos of all types of genres. Their first single was &#34;Open Your Eyes&#34; and I thought it was a pretty good song then I bought the album in the now defunct music store 'Sam Goody'.<br /><br />Listening to it completely, I was amazed at how superb of musicians and how good the lyrics were. Their debut was an amazing set of tracks to which my favorites are in order:<br />One Day Remains<br />Watch Your Words<br />Find The Real<br />Open Your Eyes<br />Shed My Skin<br /><br />Those are my tops from the album, Tremonti's guitar work has only gotten more godlike over the years and Kennedy's voice is superb. Another great thing from this album is the return of Brian Marshall to the fold. Excellent debut and monsterfull band.
B00DCX08MW|2.0|They should tell you the game is actually a dollar. It's sort of fun until you realize you only get three levels and the rest you have to pay for. It sucks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is absolutely awesome! It's not just a quick, log in-collect money-feed creatures-and log out. Really fun to play.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Awsome!  We laughed so hard- both times we watched it! It's a must see movie.  I recommended it to my daughter.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|It was an enjoyable, relaxing read and just what I was looking for.  Looking forward to reading more books in this series..
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I would definitely recommend using this dictionary any time during your reading it has made the book easier to comprehend.
B00CX7TOOG|3.0|If your a big fan of both De Niro and Travolta and your excited about this movie having the two in it together well i'd say that's where it ends because this film sucks,end of story.....i'd give this one a miss.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game has great graphics and a awesome storyline. A better improvement from the 3. The levels are very challenging. The problem is that it is hard to get gems like black iron to transmute into dragonlithe to transmute into other stones to make armor and weapons and its way to hard to get diamonds. Other than that it is amazing.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|Lord almighty be with us. Doth divine substance be named \\"Kinetic Sand\\" reign delight upon thine coworkers in my ad agency. Smiles multiply, Leah of script, Stu doth brush and I, doth reign of what the Swede bequeath as mere sand, but we taketh as joy upon laminated desk surfaces.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|this show is great! i need to get the next 2 seasons! the dvds are in perfect condition, no skipping or scratches that i can remember!! thanks so much!
B008518MOW|4.0|My Husband and I liked the movie but both felt it wasn't as good as the first two.  I would recommend it especially if you have seen the first two because of secrets revealed in the end.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Not my favorite news source, but like the USA Today app, this one always seems to work even if the news stories remain a tad superficial/populist/docutainment...
B008R65Y28|5.0|DVD arrived very quickly.  New as promised.  Packaging was great so nothing got broken, cracked or damaged at all.  Have done business with seller in the past and will continue to do business with them! 5 star rating and an A+ for price, packaging, customer service and delivery time!<br /><br />The DVD set itself was a fantastic buy.  You cannot buy all three of these movies by themselves for this price!<br /><br />In this 3 disc set you can &#34;Cry Baby&#34;, a kind of redneck/white trash version of Grease.  A lot of singing and dancing and many, many laughs.<br /><br />The second DVD is &#34;Public Enemies&#34;, and gritty, violent crime story of John Dillinger.  Johnny Depp excels at playing roles such as this where he can truly immerse himself in the character he's playing.  This one is a must watch for me.  The complexities of all the relationships between Dillinger and his gang, Dillinger and Melvin Purvis, the FBI guy, and last but not least, his relationship with Billie, his girl.  This movie explains how a 14 year old boy gets sent to prison for 10 years just for stealing $50, and how growing up in prison among hardened criminals has shaped his life.  He freely shows his violent side, but then just as easily shows his soft, tender side when he's with Billie.  There are a few artists' liberties taken in the movie, but the majority of John Dillinger's short life is played out for you with all it's twits and turns.<br /><br />The Third DVD is &#34;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#34;  I haven't quite made it through this movie yet.  It's definitely a wild ride (pun intended with all those giant bats in the desert attacking their car), a ride fueled with a multitude of various mind altering substances  There is quite a bit of comedy in this one, and it most assuredly keeps me laughing!<br /><br />Great bargain for all three full length movies for the price of one.  Johnny Depp sure can pic the roles that he knows he has quite a bit of artistic license he can get away with.  And does it work for him?  Yes it does!t away with.  And does it work for him?  Yes it does!
0062080237|3.0|This book was tedious, rambling, aimless.<br /><br />The fact that the title and book cover were designed long  before the book was written should have been a clue, but all the glowing review on Amazon misled me.<br /><br />Meaningless interludes and standalone stories dot the book throughout. The protagonist is unsympathetic and, frankly, confused.<br /><br />It's a mildly entertaining read at times, but you will struggle to get through the book.<br />Gaiman tries to interpret the essence of American-ness and - in my opinion - not only fails but bores in the process.
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|It's nothing special. Similar to a lot of other apps. I prefer Picsart. It has way more options than this.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|What's not to love about it.The big bang Theory is always a good watch no matter what season you get.
140006922X|4.0|I like the author stile and hard work on the research , is another perspective and view on the life of Jesus and a great insight to another historical facts that help us to understand more the human nature and conditions they lived , we can relate the pass with the present time and hope that some acts of violence and unjustified fanatism does not repeat through history.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Worked just fine.  Just wonder why it wasn't with my original order. It also could be a longer length although this works.
B0031RDVNM|4.0|Fast moving and not too many characters to remember. The end was really very nice.  Had dad it long ago.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|After installing this app on my razor it would not load properly and wouldn't run right. It would just stall so unfortunetly I had to delete it.
B00EU9VCKO|2.0|A friend asked me the other day how many apps I have for photo editing because it's a hobby of mine.  I actually shocked myself when I counted 48 on my Galaxy S 3. I have 64 gb of space. Lol. This app makes 49 but it isn't going to make the cut, I'm afraid.  :(<br /><br />For being a &quot;pro&quot; version, the features are so very few. No ability to add text to the photos.  What?!? Who leaves that out now? I need fonts, people, &amp; lots of them! Sure, you can sharpen and tint the picture a bit, but what apps won't?<br /><br />Definitely not worth the download and lucky they even squeezed out two stars from me!
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Written when she was only 19, Mary Shelley's brilliant book established her<br />as a fabulous writer of fearsome fiction! Extraordinary!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game, never  played before. Fun and interesting but sometimes just so to pass the time....Has enough options to keep you satisfied.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoy her book but this was a let down in a way. Because you feel like she's just trying to pro long the ending of this book. Which sucks because I enjoyed the first ones a lot, just come to an end already
0802407692|5.0|Loved it!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This game is such an addiction I needed up getting it on my kindle because playing in my phone killing my batter is just not enough
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I had  a older kindle and I loved the weather channel. I check the weather morning and night.  I GOT a new HD kindle and I HATE the new version. I find myself using my old kindle so I can check hourly weather.  If is not broke Don't Change IT.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft,but I wish that it can become night in creative mode and a easier way to delete the blocks you don't want. Any who this is a great game.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I bought this case for my 10 year old grandson and he loves it. It obviously gets a great deal of use and abuse as with any young child using it but it is holding up very well.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I love the Agent Pendergast novels, I have read all of them and some of them twice! I can't wait for the rest of this novel to be released, the first 9 chapters have whet my appetite for what's to come. Preston & Child have struck gold with the invention of Agent Pendergast, one of the most interesting fictitious character's ever to grace the written page. Preston & Child keep them coming!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can hardly wait to start the next in this series.  I like it when the book catches my attention right from the start!
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|This movie is a one [completely derivative] trick pony. I'm glad to see James Hong still earning, but can't help but feel Kevin Bacon is at least \\"six degrees separation\\" from a meaningful career... and just needed the money.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I got this app and used it for like 30 minutes. Then I went back to take a video of me and my brother and it said camera has stoped! Sooooo annoying! &gt;:-(
B007HO392S|4.0|A good mixture of rocky country music with lovely softer tunes as well. Such a big and wonderful voice delivers great lyrics and feeling.
B00EAPMGIU|5.0|Excellent copy, near mint condition case and price was reasonable. could not ask for anything better if ur a superman fan
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've played several bloons games both on the computer, and on mobile. I think BTD5 is my personal favorite. Whenever I write a review, I always make a list of pros and cons, but I can't think of a single con to give this game. If the rating could go higher than five, I'd still give it top rating.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's not The Shining! That book scared the bejesus out of me! But it's a good book. Maybe because I'm older now, like Mr King himself, it didn't scare me at all. But I enjoyed reading about Danny Torrance & his life. I never thought about a sequel to The Shining but I'm glad Mr King wrote it. And I want to thank Mr King for not killing off my heroes, something he usually does. I think I may try to reread The Shining, something I've never done since the 1st read. Eventually. And Mr King, I totally agree with you about the movie with Jack Nicholson, I hate that movie! I wanted my money back after I saw it. & I've never watched it again either.  But thanks for Dr Sleep, a very enjoyable read.
B00CATSONE|1.0|The author usurps Tesla's name  in the title  of the  book, fooling the reader into believing it is about the life of  the scientist.  Instead, he rushes through Tesla's accomplishments, focusing on how Edison, Morgan, and Carnegie betrayed and used him.  Then, the author does the same  to Tesla, using  his name  to sell books about his own agenda and interest.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Quiet fade-in alarm with soft music, easy to read and set clock and easy to customize settings. My thanks to the developer for such an excellent app!
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|Emergency Landing is a jet landing sim where all you do is land the place given the appropriate cues, such as fly through this path (despite the wind and rain), at this speed, while lowering the gear at flaps at the right times (you control the plane and the throttle). You are given a rating after each landing, but there's no discussion on how you can improve your &#34;score&#34;. What appears to be a perfect landing often produced a few casualties with apparently no particular reason at all. What's worse, the game only comes with tutorial missions, with the rest of the missions only only available as mission packs for in-app purchases. This is a DEMO, without being labelled as such. It's... annoying.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This is a good SF film, with concepts, mysteries, and strong action.  However, after so much expectation, it disappoints.  The story takes place many years before Alien, when a privately funded group makes an exploratory inter-stellar voyage to investigate some intriguing archaeological clues.  They are on the track of the \\"engineers\\", an exemplar of whom died mysteriously at the beginning of the film and whose whereabouts were hinted at in cave paintings found all over the world by Shaw and her partner, Charlie.  What they discover is not what they expect, to say the least.  Also, there are many secret agendas revealed, adding nuance.  In the end, as a survivor, Shaw continues her quest.<br /><br />Now, this is intriguing stuff, full of possibility.  Unfortunately, the execution of the film, its uneven acting, and problems with the plot combine to make a mediocre viewing experience.  I do not want to give away the plot details, but some may slip through.<br /><br />First, the quality of the acting was a constant problem.  While Rapace was great in Dragon Tatoo, she is supposed to be English but can't get the accent consistently.  While she does a good job with the complexity of her character's motivations, her intimate relationship with Charlie (who is terribly acted by Logan and never cogent as a character) makes little sense.  The other crew members were clearly fodder for destruction and the few with any character seemed rushed in their actions and motivations.  Theron is an exception to this, but David the android is perhaps the best - he is clearly not human, has inscrutable motives and emotions that are consistent, and is somehow always menacingly creepy.  Alas, the character chemistry doesn't quite hang together.<br /><br />Second, the explanation for the monsters was disappointing, indeed much of the logic of the film is wobbly.  While the engineers were very well done as beings of superior intelligence and seemingly incomprehensible motives, their behavior and what they were doing were unconvincing to me.  In addition, the resulting monstrosities were not conceived with much care, but just seemed hideous and violent, without interesting constraints and clear powers.  The development of the monsters appears too magical:  how could they develop so quickly, live so long and be so overwhelmingly strong, without a source of energy or food?  Take, for example, Shaw's aborted monster:  it continues to grow to monstrous proportions in the med lab with nothing but itself.  Even worse, after Shaw undergoes major surgery, she just gets stapled up, and then with some futuristic pain killers is fine running around and fighting baddies.  How could she do so without hemorrhaging?  Also, the way that David deciphers the alien language and writing and instrument panels smacks me as contrived.  As others have pointed out, the behavior of the scientists is also incomprehensible:  if one of them saw an alien worm slithering out of the cornea of one of his eyes - and experiencing no pain? - would he not quarantine himself or bring it to someone's attention?  Would the biologist not fear a snake-like creature rising out of some primordial muck?  Would the scientists not fear infection in an unknown atmosphere, but instead instantly take their helmets off?  These things are so ridiculous that they strain all credibility.<br /><br />Third, the effects were not entirely convincing.  This is a high budget film, but much of it seemed clunky, such as the creature that drags itself to the ship and offs, like, half the crew in a few instants - it looks like a flailing rubber doll.  Or take a creature that emerges from a character's stomach - it comes out bigger than it could have been.  I did enjoy the alien technology, and the engineers themselves - gigantic beings of super strength and superior minds - are splendidly mesmerizing.  Again, this speaks to the unevenness of the film, where much of it feels rushed and ill conceived.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this for fans of the series.  But hopefully better is yet to come.y, I recommend this for fans of the series.  But hopefully better is yet to come.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I couldn't wait to crack the book since it received such great reviews.  From the first 50 pages or so, it was  just like other books, MANY other books.  No original ideas.<br />DISSAPOINTED!  Don't waist your time.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Overall I would rate this series as outstanding. Good plot lines, good acting, and keeps you wanting the next one to hurry up. It is defiantly worth watching, more than once. I enjoyed the first season immensely and I enjoyed the second season just as much. I can't wait for Season 3. Hurry up already.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I like a lot Brandon Sanderson books.  Mistborn was my first(favorite) and I have traveled through many realms and met many characters he has created.  While I wouldn't say this is one of the best, it is still very good.  I really enjoyed it, although it did seem like I didn't connect with some of the characters as much as I usually do.  Would recommend it to friends.  I think one thing that kind of irked me was how similar steelheart is to superman.  I think he could have been slightly more original in that aspect.  I'll still look forward to the next book if there is one.

B00CQZ65SI|5.0|I am a fan of Novak, and after reading this book I am grateful not only for hours of entertainment watching him playing tennis, but for sharing the benefits of going on a gluten free diet.  I've tried it for a month, and can definitely see and feel the benefits!  Excellent book to keep around in the tennis bag, as well as the kitchen.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it was too slow moving for my tastes. I couldn't get through it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Nothing in this world can beat the walking dead. The characters, the zombies, the suspense, the relationships, the heartache, just all of it. Best thing on this planet. Addicting, heart wrenching, incredible. Worth it.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I tend to favor historical novels that take a real event and wrap a fictional story around it.  That is exactly what this novel does.  I found it extremely interesting, as we here in the United States don't hear much about a French involvement in the Holocaust.  The characters were very well developed and stayed true to their characterizations throughout the story.  When you finish the book, you'll feel sad, but will also feel you learned a lot about living in France in the year 1942.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love sudoku and this app delivers!  I spend all my extra time playing.  it's easy to use and has levels for you to play easy all the way to expert.  it doesn't need Internet so you can play it anywhere.
B004GXZ69W|2.0|The connection from the wire to the inside of the mouse is loose, causing intermittent operation. The ergonomic design is good for a change when working with a mouse all day. I alternate between this and a regular mouse but the smooth metal surface for the thumb is too smooth and causes slippage and body heat conduction. I checked out the manufacturer's website and cannot return it under their warranty because I bought it here on Amazon. I can't return it through Amazon because it's past the return policy timeframe. $90 for 8 months of use!  Unless the seller/Amazon or the manufacturer want to make this right, I won't be buying another one and I WILL NOT recommend it to others.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addictive, challenging, sometimes frustrating, but continually changing.  This is the first game of this sort I have downloaded and it makes me want to get others.  But not until I've beaten this one, which means it will probably be a while.

B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I have not laughed so much in a LONG time. The transaction was A++ all the way. Highly recommend them.
B000FBFM9S|3.0|The prose is beautiful as is the messaging.  Many of the characters don't redeem themselves, which is probably better. That said, it took me a long time to get through for some reason. I'd definitely suggest the book, however.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This little guy has gone quite a ways towards replacing our media PC.  If it would stream local content without the need of screencasting from a PC it would be almost perfect.  We mostly use it for NetFlix and youtube, which consists of about 2/3rds of our viewing.<br /><br />One annoying thing that I will hope get fixed in later updates is the inability to force youtube to a certain quality setting.  Right now it just auto shifts and has little or no ability to buffer.  As long as our 10mb DSL is not congested, and we block CDN servers at the router as well, it's usually okay but there are times were it's flipping back and forth between standard HD.  One other minor thing is older shows on netflix do tend to look a -tiny- bit pixelated when compared to streaming from the media PC -  Not sure why that is but it only seems to happen with older/standard def shows, HD is amazing.  Would also be nice if you could use the TV remote to control some features as you have to use a smartphone, tablet, or PC to control it but that is not that big of a deal.<br /><br />It has limited apps at the moment, would be nice to see other services but still, for price you really can't beat it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fire Maple makes the best puzzle/adventure games I've found so far.  I've tried others in the genre, and they can't hold a candle to Fire Maple's excellent games.  Great puzzles that aren't too hard but not too easy either.  And if you get stuck, there's a handy help system which doesn't force itself on you like other games.  But it's there if you need it.  The puzzles are well-designed, the art is beautiful, and the sound is immersive.  It's a steal at 99 cents.<br /><br />I grew up playing all the great adventure games, like King's Quest, Space Quest, Monkey Island, etc.  Mosaika's puzzles remind me a lot of those games, but the gameplay style more closely resembles Myst than the quest games.<br /><br />The game looks gorgeous on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />This is the kind of game you can play in bursts whenever you get a couple minutes of free time.  It starts up quickly, and always saves your progress.<br /><br />I also highly recommend The Lost City and The Secret of Grisly Manor, also by Fire Maple.  Once you start playing these games, you'll soon have them all beat, and you'll find yourself waiting for the next release (as I have) from Fire Maple.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|We have got this for our 10 month olds, they didn't really get into it, but the product itself is quality stuff.  For the price I expected less.  We used it three times this summer and I imagine many more times next summer.<br /><br />I didn't like having to find the 6 or 7 plugs to inflate, but the pump that a lot of people buy with this pool is worth it.  It made quick work of inflating and deflating the pool.  Maybe 20 minutes from box to fully inflated and filling with water.  10 minutes to take down.  The side shower feature may be great later but it just annoyed my wife and kids this year.  It was easy to turn off and worked well.  The slide seems kinda useless so I wouldn't buy for that feature.  Also, make sure you have an area that is flat.  The bottom is slick and uneven ground could lead to falls and give you different depths.<br /><br />I did like the inflatable toys that came with the pool.  The kids found them very entertaining.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Yes I would recommand this for anyone to watch, Love history about the wars that the Uited States was envolved in.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|We tried the trial free version and the kids liked it so much we bought the full app.  Glad we purchased it as they loved it.<br /><br />The app has adorable characters with bright colors.  App is engaging and my kids are learning their letters without even knowing it (which is great because they fought me when I tried to teach them to read).  They loved the build an animal with the letter they were learning!  Really cute.
B004QNN1UI|4.0|I like having both the CD and DVD and since I'm a big fan of Simply Red, I certainly enjoy both.  However, I would recommend if you can find it to get the concert they did in Sicily instead....better concert by far and lovely to watch.  I also liked the song selections better.  But if you like Simply Red, this combo will not disappoint.

B00EQ30RVY|5.0|The next chapter in one of the truly epic stories in rock history is about to be written. Someday it'll make a great movie. Will it be a cautionary narrative, or a tale of redemption?<br /><br />The story of Stone Temple Pilots is fraught with highs and lows, peppered with drama and drugs. It's a dream of rock stardom come true that lurched into a nightmare of discord before collapsing into a pile of legal briefs.<br />Could this story have a happy ending? Just a few months ago, that seemed impossible. How would the band replace the brilliant but troubled Scott Weiland, one of the most iconic vocalists and performers of his generation? Newly christened Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington, what would the band sound like with the Linkin Park frontman at the helm? With the release of the band's new five-song EP, High Rise, we're about to find out.<br /><br />Let's dig into High Rise, track by track:<br /><br />1) Out of Time - The band opens with a full-throttle, lightning-fast riff, with Bennington establishing his presence over top. The song starts as a battle cry, and then injects tuneful melody and harmony into the mix before plowing back into the main theme. Despite elements of familiarity, Out of Time is a departure from anything STP has done in the past. Released as a single in May, the song was well-received, reaching number 1 on both the Active Rock and Mainstream Rock charts.<br /><br />2) Black Heart - Fans who are only casually familiar with Bennington's work won't know what hit them. They'd likely never imagined Bennington as a melodic pop/rock singer, but that's role he plays on Black Heart. It's a style that comes to him so naturally, it's hard to believe it isn't his claim to fame.<br /><br />Here, Bennington sings a clean melody over a vibrant, stomping beat. A juxtaposition of bright harmonies and dark lyrics, Black Heart bounces along and then rolls into an irresistible, harmony-laden break, leading to a tasty, country-fried solo by guitarist Dean DeLeo. Like any great pop tune, Black Heart seems to end almost too soon - and leaves the listener longing for a repeat.<br /><br />3) Same On The Inside - Here the tone shifts dramatically; the band drives an urgent riff as Bennington's vocals take on an almost angelic quality. It's a beautifully unexpected marriage of music and lyrics, with the band providing an intense backdrop as Bennington plaintively questions, \\"When do we stop pretending that we're all the same on the inside?\\" It ends with a dreamy, melodic guitar solo that is pure magic.<br /><br />4) Cry Cry - The band displays masterful dynamics on this number. It starts with a swampy guitar riff, and then shifts into a gentle verse, which gradually builds with shimmering guitars. Bassist Robert DeLeo stands out here, as he hangs back during the verse, and then swoops in as the song explodes into its dramatic, hard-rocking chorus. Of the five songs on High Rise, this one sounds the closest to classic STP.<br /><br />5) Tomorrow - Featuring intricately layered guitars, this may be the best tune on High Rise. Bennington's vocals build slowly, then soar like a bird taking flight. Eric Kretz's drumming is masterful here, his fills popping like fireworks during the song's bridge.<br /><br />What is the main takeaway from High Rise? Chester Bennington is definitely a different flavor from Scott Weiland, but taken on his own merits, he will surprise many skeptics. On High Rise, he proves himself a terrific, almost understated lead vocalist with a great sense of melody. He's well known for his high-voltage performances with Linkin Park, but equally effective here in his new role. Not only does he make it sound easy, but Bennington seems to inherently `get' STP, a band that he grew up idolizing and dreamed of fronting. He's a natural fit here.<br /><br />Critics will say that High Rise doesn't sound like STP's earlier work, and that's true. But upon further review, no two of this band's first five albums sound alike. Their 1992 debut, Core, was a huge success.  It would've been easy for STP to churn out another straight-forward, heavy rock album.<br /><br />Instead they recorded 1994's Purple, a bright, trippy mix of diverse rock tunes interwoven with unforgettable melodies and sparkling musicianship. Interstate Love Song remains a staple of rock radio, with its iconic, signature guitar licks.<br /><br />Purple's success was followed by another total departure, 1996's jazz-infused, downbeat Tiny Music - Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop. Next came the polished, driving hard rock of Number 4, and the experimental Shangri-La-De-Da. To the untrained ear, those five albums could easily have been recorded by five different bands.<br /><br />The unifying theme of STP's past is the band's penchant for unpredictable, adventurous, rock with irresistible melodies and brilliant musicianship. Using that as a standard, High Rise fits in well. It seems the incredible story of Stone Temple Pilots is far from over.d alike. Their 1992 debut, Core, was a huge success.

B008AK8FHM|1.0|What magnificent hubris!  As inspiring as this book may be, it is totally lacking in any form of proof.  It is not at all clear that Dr. Alexander experienced a near-death state as opposed to being critically ill, and there is quite a big difference between the two.  The book has quite a lot of emotionally charged verbiage that has no relevance to a proof, and at the end of the book there is only personal assertion.  Many people all over the world experience phenomenon that they cannot explain.  I am one of those who had an \\"out of body\\" experience where my consciousness felt detached from my body and instead was connected to literally everything in the Universe.<br /><br />My own experience was very brief, and when I got back into my body and fully aware of the group meditation going on around me, I was left with a \\"message\\" of connectedness, hope, and forgiveness.  At the time, these were things I very much wanted and needed.  That experience was thirteen years ago, and that sense of connectedness has not diminished.<br /><br />So what does my experience prove?  Absolutely nothing except that a 64 year old pediatrician can report a sudden alteration of attitude and belief that has persisted for thirteen years and can still be appreciated and reported today.  And what does Dr. Alexander's experience prove?  Exactly the same thing.  He had an experience that for him, as for me, was awe-inspiring, beautiful, and life altering.  But it proves nothing beyond that.  Nothing at all.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander argues at the end of his book that because he, an apparently well-trained neurosurgeon, cannot explain what happened to him, that it then must be due to some super-natural phenomenon.  Dr. Alexander must have been in the restroom while the rest of his medical school class were being informed that despite rumors to the contrary, they would not be granted god-like powers when they graduated.  The argument that what cannot be immediately explained must therefore be an act of God is the same argument used by all religions up to the time of the Enlightenment, and is still used by fundamentalists today.  Good, properly conducted science has consistently disproven religious explanations for the phenomenon that, in the past, we have not been able to understand.  It is just a matter of time before Dr. Alexander will have a more concrete explanation, as will I.  And the elegance of a sound explanation will enhance, not diminish, the impact of that phenomenon for me.<br /><br />Charles R.

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Every time Christoph Fischer publishes a new book, I lose a night of sleep, happily and willingly. Yes, his books are that good. Impossible to put down. What I love about his writing is his incredible ability to present  impeccably researched historical events with a personal perspective, through family stories - and isn't that the best way to engage the readers and make history real? Especially if the story is well-told. And Christoph Fischer knows how to write amazing stories. I absolutely loved his first two books, and this one is even better - and I didn't even think that was possible.<br /><br />The book is about Germany, its history, and its people, but Christoph Fischer's presentation of that history will hold interest of readers well beyond Germany.  Part of my childhood was spent in Russia, and I clearly remember the animosity that the older generation held towards Germany - towards everything German, to the point of refusing to take German classes in schools because nobody wanted to learn \\"the language of the fascists.\\" When I was younger, I saw the events of World War II exclusively from the Russian perspective - post-war  re-building, re-structuring, recovering, etc. Like many of my peers, I never considered the other point of view - how did Germany recover, not just economically and physically, but philosophically and culturally? How can a country move forward, regain its pride, its sense of identity after so many atrocities and horror that it inflicted upon the world and, of course, upon its neighboring countries. And that's one of the main issues that Christoph Fischer addresses in his book, and that's what fascinated me and kept me glued to my Kindle until the very last page of this beautifully written and incredible novel.<br /><br />But, of course, this is not a textbook - even though the research that obviously went into writing it can surpass that of most textbooks - it is a riveting story of a family, of specific people, with their own opinions, ideologies, philosophies and issues, all set against the backdrop of the changing political landscape of wartime and post-war Germany.  Christoph Fischer does not shy away from tough issues, so there's everything in this novel, from religion to politics to homosexuality - all real issues that real people have to tackle. A fascinating new book from a talented author. Absolutely brilliant.ideologies, philosophies and issues, all set against the backdrop of the changing political landscape of wartime and post-war Germany.

0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  It is my favorite book this year and maybe forever.  I loved the way Enzo the dog told his story and the story of his family. After reading this book I won't be able to look into my dogs' eyes the same. The story hooked me from the beginning and I hated it when it ended. I'm a dog lover but I don't think you have to be one to enjoy this book. It has ups and downs but life is like that. Read it! You won't regret it.

B000SEGUDE|3.0|This is a novel of short stories strung together by a thread.  As you read a story you will find one character that was in the previous story.  I was really interested in how this was all going to turn out in the end but I could not get through it!  The first story was a struggle but I was glad I kept with it because the second two stories I really liked and so I  got into it.  But then it fell apart. His writing is overly difficult and pretentious in places and he puts forth a style that I found too hard to read. I felt like &#34;what is the point dragging myself through this just to see how he finishes this&#34;?  My rating is an average of 2s and 4s based on the separate stories.  But it all makes for a strange reading experience and therefore I cannot recommend it.

0439023521|5.0|I really liked this book!  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins rocks!  The book is fast paced with lots of action and you really get to know, like and dislike the characters.  The story takes place in the future where life is hard.  There are 12 districts that are all very different, producing special goods depending on where they are located.  These districts must all give up one male and one female known as tributes to fight to the death in the Hunger Games.  All this occurs on live TV. These games are designed by the government to keep the districts in line.  There is a lot of hype associated with the games and the tributes are considered celebrities.<br /><br />The two main characters are Katniss and Peeta.  They come from a poor mining district where Katniss has struggled her whole life.  Along the way she has picked up cool skills like hunting with her bow and knowing how to track and these end up helping her survive the Hunger Games.  I really liked Katniss.  She is tough but also had a soft side which I think Peeta brings out in her.  My favorite part of the book is the action of the games.  Don't get me wrong, this book is very violent and bloody and many people die as they struggle to survive in the Hunger Games.  So read with caution because it can be intense.  Overall all the hunger Games leaves you hungry for more!
B008AIGWVA|2.0|I spent like It's not the best app but it is fun I would recommend not to  get it I. Spent like 5 minutes and I got bored it's not the best

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a lot of fun playing this. Wish it was longer though. 5 stars for sure. I highly recommend this game to any one looking for a challenge.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is a must have. One of the rest I have played on the kindle fire. Action packed and full of adventure , something different around every corner. So what are you waiting for get this game as soon as possible.
B000PMG16U|5.0|it's a good series to have if you like star wars at all. it shows through out the trilogy how a lot of the characters in the original trilogy developed especially darth vader and obi one.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|he takes me to foreign places and introduces me to wonderful characters and all the while makes me fell...thank you mr hosseini
B0021L9MJG|4.0|this is a good movie to watch if you like scary movies it is not overly scary but good all the same, may not want to have young kids watch it,but you will have to decide after seeing it first
0316204366|2.0|It is early into the book for me, but I think Mr Gladwell is to expansive in some of his statements. In many ways he seems open to many outliers being inserted into his text. I worry if fame and the talk of genius has gone to his head. He is not a genius and if the book continues has is, I will start to think he is even not very smart!
B008LV8TSU|3.0|With elements of mystery, grandiosely flawed characters, and a healthy dose of charm, Wynne Jones serves up a story that's well worth reading. However... there are some real structural problems with this book. Recurring elements are poorly established and inexpertly linked to later. The ending is a rush of \\"so this is what was happening all along\\" and seems to be predicated upon poorly communicated themes and abandoned concepts. There's a lot of unrealized promise in the story and characters and I found myself wishing it had been written in a post-Harry Potter world where Wynne Jones may have had the luxury of another 200 pages to bring things to a more satisfying conclusion.
B001EC0OPO|5.0|Great movie!!! Definitely in my top 10 all time favorite comedies.  Star packed and well written.  I have had it on dvd since it came out and bought it here so I can watch it no matter where I go if I have internet and forgot the dvd.  Is it worth $10? What is the price of a smile? What is the price of laughing when you have a bad day?
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I think bribe is okay but on kindle fire HD you can just use the web button in the top scrolling bar and type in youtube it works better. I got this app because I thought it would work faster but it did not so it is sorta pointless
B0012PDVUS|5.0|I have always loved the movie and I have ALWAYS loved the book.  The two shall never meet and I find myself yelling at the screen every time (just as I do with every Dune movie and a few others).  Yet I still watch it. . . Is there a name for this sickness? haha
0792844890|5.0|Classic. This is definitely a must own classic. I can never get enough of Mel Brooks... And this one is one of my favorites!

B005HSL626|5.0|Great to have this available when you have time to kill. Mindless fun for free! Become a fruit ninja yourself
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Bought the Kindle edition after seeing the movie, which is the best way, because then there are no images that conflict inside your head. Image conflict happens when you read a book, form images, and then hate the movie because the images in the movie conflict with your own. The book was well written, but I had to use the excellent dictionary facility of the Kindle quite often. The author tries to use language as a way to make every period in the narrative distinct, which he succeeds in doing. It would have been very tedious to jump up for a dictionary every time I came across an unfamiliar word and very impractical had it happened in a coffee shop or while waiting for someone in my car. Which convinces me that a Kindle is the only way to read a story.
055358894X|4.0|This is not your typical fantasy novel. There is not much in the way of magic, warlords, orcs, wizards, elves, etc. In this respect it is a nice change of pace. The overall idea is also different than normal. The main character(s) is actually a villain when it comes down to it. He, Locke Lamora, is not necessarily evil (he doesn't murder for fun) but his ease of petty theft makes him a &#34;bad guy&#34;.<br />The main things I did not like were poor character development, deus ex machina, and the overall predictability of the ending. There are also many instances in which Lamora and gang are a little to smart-aleck for their own good. However, this issue is one reason why this would probably make an entertaining movie or television series. Love it or not, the one-liners are fairly clever.<br />Nevertheless it's a unique story and different from what I've come to expect from the fantasy genre. I highly recommend it for those who are addicted to fantasy but can't seem to escape the typical fantasy elements.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book after obsessing over the Tv show that was based on this book. It's pretty different than the show but I really enjoyed it.

B000NQRR1Q|2.0|The seller was fast and packaged the DVD very well, but the quality of the DVD itself is not good.  The resolution was worse than anything I've seen on even B&W television.<br /><br />Instead of people trying to be the next Siskel and Ebert, I wish someone would have commented on the quality of the DVD instead of giving their philosophical blah blah.<br /><br />Buy the Blu Ray.  I just re-purchased it in that format.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great we love this game it is well worth playing we love it. Any one who likes games then get it.Great game.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|At first I wasnt sure that I would actually be able to learn a different language and not have to pay. But this app really helps, I'm taking French at school and on Duolingo, so I'm pretty much ahead! I think its awesome. I think that maybe, they could make the basics easier because I'm sure someone who is just randomly starting the languages wont be able to understand. Also it would he nice if their were a few more languages.. but I recommend to everyone :)
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is the best yet! I love the cast chosen, I felt it was true to the story, believable and honest. This is a gift, and I am hoping I get a copy for myself this Christmas.

B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Quality of dvd less than ideal as there were starts and stops in numerous episodes. Episodes had moments that stretched credibility.  Last episode was a strong one although the Carrie/Brodie relationship does border on major implausibility, BUT hey it's on a tv show.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it. However way too short. It reminded me of the pc game mist. Which is one of my all time favorites.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Quality of dvd excellent. Taught, tense scripts. Compelling characters.  Seeing Homeland for the first time and the show delivered in all aspects.
B00006879E|5.0|I like Maroon 5. They have a sound midway between Train and Stevie Wonder. A couple of hits you will recognize from airplay are on here, but the ones you haven't heard are just as good. I am well satisfied with this purchase.
0805047905|5.0|This book is so cute for children. My son is only 9 weeks old, so not really interested in it yet although I've read it to him several times. I remember my nephews loving it so I had to get it for my son's collection.
B000FA675C|4.0|Have to say that in spite of what critics say - I enjoyed it!  It captured my imagination.  It moves along quickly and I've actually read it several times.  Thanks.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|exactly what i was looking for and easy to setup too.  i can find something on my computer, want my wife to see it, so i just cast it to tv monitor and makes it easy to view it together

0425261360|3.0|This book was better then the past few Scarpetta novels, which is to say it was at least readable. It still suffered from the same problems that've been hanging around this series for a while.<br /><br />-Virtually every female Kay encounters is obsessively jealous of her, in book after book after book, and it's just not believable anymore. It's a plot element that would've been perfectly believable...once. But it just keeps being returned to over and over and it's past obnoxious at this point.<br />-Marino outlived his purpose in this series long ago. I used to like him in the earlier books, but now he's just running in place and (surprise, surprise!) obsessed with Kay. Write him out or kill him already.<br />-Black Ops lone wolf Lucy. Does anyone actually enjoy her elements of the story? Unlike Marino, she's never been a good character - from the very beginning, she was \\"the most gorgeous, the most smart, the toughest\\" etc etc and it was always a little eye-rolling. It reached critical mass a long time ago and Lucy is just ridiculous and irritating now.<br />-There's only so much one wants to hear about all of Kay's \\"fine\\" furniture, cars, wine, food, etc.<br />-As always, the murder is solved in the final 5 pages with little rhyme or reason.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm getting this scathing about a book I called an improvement and handed three stars, but honestly - that's how bad Cornwell's last few books have been. The endless dialog is at least an improvement over the pages after pages of Kay navel-gaving inside her own head. Why do I keep reading this author? Partly because I loved books like Postmortem and the Body Farm, and partly because I keep finding myself underprepared in airports. Oh, well.

Its smaller then i imagined and the pages arent really glossy or anything, it seems almost as it was printed on craft construction paper which makes the picture quality not a good. Other then that this book is fantastic and well done! Really shows the bond between a dog and its human.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Grisham keeps you hooked to the book - a good reason to stay in bed for a year (see Sue Townsend).  Read it and enjoy it as all of his books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The most honest and yet tastefully withholding piece of literature I've ever read. It was quick but it was slow. The story of Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters was romanticized but not excessive. Basically a compilation of ands and ors. It is everything and it is nothing. For the short time I read it, this book challenged me, it comforted me, it saddened me. The fiction became real as all the best books do. And as the best ones do, it seemed infinite, yet the end was a satisfying relief. Immediately I wanted it to start again.

1400079276|3.0|Reading this earlier Murakami novel after loving his more recent [[ASIN:0307476464 1Q84 (Vintage International)]], I felt the presence of many similar themes and situations, but didn't find it as compelling.<br /><br />Kafka on the Shore doesn't define its separate worlds as clearly as does 1Q84, but its characters move between varied levels of consciousness, alternating at any given time between real and surreal planes. As usual, Murakami doesn't provide readers with any explanation of what occurs, and I'm okay with that, but protagonist Kafka Tamura's physical and metaphysical journeys just didn't resonate with me as strongly as did those of other Murakami characters in previous reads.<br /><br />The Oedipus complex is one thematic component from both Kafka on the Shore and 1Q84 in which Murakami goes a lot deeper in the former: Kafka literally runs away from a prophesy that he'll kill his father and have sex with his mother, a prophesy told to him at a young age by his father himself. In 1Q84, Tengo subconsciously fantasizes about a sexual encounter between his mother and another man that he imagines to have witnessed as a baby, and he struggles to believe that the man who raised him was his biological father, but the book's Oedipal undertones are less direct.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book because I find Murakami's writing style addictive and I'm always curious to see what will happen next (his books are full of surprises and just about anything can happen), but overall I found it slightly disappointing. Perhaps I would've liked it more if I hadn't read 1Q84 first because I felt it suffered by comparison.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is my favorite game to play since it is very entertaining yet challenging!  It's not boring,  so you will not lose interest and never play the game like so many other games I've played.  Looking forward to more games.
0316223239|5.0|Awesome book! I definitely encourage others to read this book. It's a bitter sweet story. Most of the time I cried, but at the end it made me happy.
B00DDVPXTG|5.0|Everything by Emmylou is so great that I do not have words to describe her music. Five albums, one CD is hard to find, two are on CD for first time, and  I had already  had two CDs. The price was so low that it was great deal for the 3 CDs that I did hot have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has to be one of the best free apps ever . Fun for all ages . I could play for hours.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good product easy to set up .can't beat the price. Just plugged it into my hdmi switched the corresponding input on my remote and set it up, takes 5 minutes. What I liked about this is that it gives you an option to plug it into an outlet or it comes with a usb cable to connect to a USB port on the  TV to power chrome cast. Like the fact that i can use my galaxy note 3 has a remote to pick the movies via Netflix app and play them on my TV. I can pick any movie during the day save them to my list and watch them when ever. Also one less box to dust off on my TV shelves. You can even see the chromecast device, so that's good if you like to avoid  Clutters of modems and cable box...etc. Overall good pruduct.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|The AI has some serious strategy problems.  In the last game I played, it had all its remaining pieced on 1 and 2, and rolled double ones.  It should have removed 4 from the board, but instead moved 4 from the 2 position, to the 1 position.  Stupid.  Making up for this deficiency, the computer gets better rolls.  It doesn't get more doubles, but it gets higher totals, and usually gets exactly what it needs.  Still fun, but still flawed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! My kids and myself love playing this game you guys have made a great game thanks for making it free!! The updates with different locations and halloween things are wonderful!
044024613X|4.0|I like the way Landay writes his novels.  I am a chapter reader so once I start have to finish the chapter at least.  They are short and quick and flows with the story line.  Was a good book to read thou I figured out the ending and in between.  Maybe I know him to well as a writer.  Hahaha
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Just downloaded this game and I am officially addicted. I got to level 4 and found the key to open the door and for some reason I can't pick them up. I tap them and nothing happened. I thought maybe I was missing something I needed but no that's it. So I love this game but I am now stuck and cannot go forward. Hopefully the creators will fix this problem so others can enjoy and I can finish!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I liked this book so much more than I thought I would. When I saw the cover, I thought it would just be a simple love story, but it was so much more. The development of the protagonist worked perfectly for me. I especially loved the way the author described his personality traits, and his understanding of them (probably because I perceive I have some of the same ones). And I enjoyed seeing how he navigated successfully and at other times unsuccessfully through the different parts of his life. His coping skills are very interesting indeed.<br />The stories of the wife project and the bio-father DNA project evolved perfectly for me. It was the perfect length book with a great ending, and no extra editing was needed (for a change it seems these days).<br />I live in the Mid-Atlantic and picked this up during the latest three day coastal storm.  I read the entire book in three sittings, laughing out loud at times, feeling joy and sorrow for some of the characters which silenced the rain and wind slamming my windows. I did not rush through the book, but simply wanted to keep reading it.<br />I read somewhere that the story was optioned for a movie, and it should translate easily into that medium.  I will be eager to see who directs it, as well as who will play the main parts.<br />Also oddly I liked every character in this book including those with some glaring faults. I felt as those I knew some of them.<br />I highly recommend this book, and I will look for future books by this Australian author.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been trying to log into kik for months now and it keeps saying try again in a bit!!! Other people are having the same problem... so the people seriously need to fix this.

B00ECLU346|4.0|I liked the movie but find it not as good a the first two.  I think they may have taken this one a bit too much over the top. But considering the earlier versions, maybe not. I was glad to see that they kept the same main characters.
B00F5I344G|5.0|I seen a review here that stated they don't sound like the old power trio with Allen Woody.<br />And true the first two CD's do have a different sound.<br />But by the third CD \\"Life Before Insanity\\" the sound was changing and for the better.<br />That CD is one of my favorites.<br />They were becoming a little less jammy then Allen died and they did that whole all star bass player<br />experiment with the two \\"Deep End\\" Cd's.<br />Now jump to 2013 with \\"Shout\\" I think it is Mules best CD to date.<br />Warren has written some of his best songs on this disc with my two favs \\"When The World Gets Small\\" and<br />\\"Bring On The Music\\".<br />Warren and the boys hit it out of the park on this one no filler tunes on here.<br />Even the bonus disc with other people singing these songs works very well too.<br />Vintage Trouble's Ty Taylor is amazing on \\"Bring On The Music\\" he makes it his own and Elvis Costello<br />on \\"Funny Little Tragedy\\" is incredible and again he makes it his own.<br />You also have Ben Harper, Dave Matthews and Steve Winwood doing great versions.<br />Warren Haynes is the hardest working man in Rock and a talent that can not be denied.<br />Buy this CD

B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I actually know the answer to the question posed in this review's title.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was pure gold in every way imaginable.  And being pure gold there would most certainly be the seductive urge to nurse yet again at the teats of the cash cow.  And there might not have been anything wrong in doing a sequel!  After all, as far as cinematic sequels go BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN was a much better film than FRANKENSTEIN and GODFATHER II was likewise superior to part one of the Corleone story.  Now if a story had come along that was really and truly worth the effort of coming forth with a follow-up to Eric's sad saga, then so be it. More power to all the powers-that-be concerned!<br /><br />But LOVE NEVER DIES tells a completely cliched, totally unbelievable, sappy, sloppy, silly story that seems to involve none of the characters from the original musical production, even though they may be tagged with the same names and similar costumes. If the original PHANTOM is heightened soap opera, these are the suds and suds only.  The story - and the song lyrics largely used to tell that story - absolutely reeks.<br /><br />As to Sir Andrew's music, I must say that I really enjoyed a few selections.  The opening song \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" is the best number in the entire show.  It is far richer and romantic than the title song itself.  \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" is a catchy, driven song, as is \\"Devil Take the Hindmost.\\"  And Christine and Gustave's duet - \\"Look With Your Heart\\" - is touching and tender.  These melodies - not the ding-dong lyrics - are what is worth the rather low price of the DVD.  (Unfortunately, I don't think that the soundtrack to this production has been released yet on CD.)  One thing, though, about Sir Andrew's music:  beautiful as it so overwhelmingly can be, there is much in it that sounds derivative.  I remember years ago Sir Andrew was on a talk show and told the story of how his father reminded him that one of his signature songs  - \\"Memory\\"  - sounded much like a melody from some Italian opera.  I've noted this imitative tendency also.  In the original POTO, every time I'd hear \\"Music of the Night\\" I couldn't help but hear the beginning melody of the song \\"School Days\\".  And the driving musical intro to the main song for POTO is identical to a few licks from a piece in Prokofiev's score for ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  So it is with many of the songs in LOVE NEVER DIES: the title song has much in common with Kern's \\"You Are Love\\" from SHOWBOAT mixed together with another source melody which title eludes me.  Even \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" sounds hauntingly familiar, with a smidgen of \\"Evergreen\\" in it - but the refrain is definitely bugging me because I have heard it elsewhere. It will hopefully come to me - and when it does I will add to these comments. Despite these observations, Sir Andrew is still a great, great composer.  And, despite the syrupy storyline of LOVE NEVER DIES, it is still worth a look and listen - even if just to hear some rich and rewarding music.  But be forewarned: if you wish to keep your precious memories of the original magnificent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA inviolate...then pass this one by.d much like a melody from some Italian opera.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am really enjoying learning Spanish with this app. I had one year of Spanish in high school but I don't remember it. The app makes it fun. My kids like it too.
B00EU9VCKO|3.0|Tried this for a few minutes, then uninstalled. The filters seem less interesting than Instagram (and dozens of similar apps) and this app doesn't have the sharing options of Instagram. I've really lost interest in Instagram-style apps anyway. Years ago, these types of filter apps really could improve on (or at least hide the flaws of) the out-of-focus inaccurate-color photos typically produced by smartphone cameras. Nowadays, smartphone cameras are so much better that I much prefer photo tuning apps like Snapseed that help you bring out the details in your photos.

B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Having effectively deactivated Nine Inch Nails in 2009, band mastermind Trent Reznor had seemingly gone on to greener pastures, winning an Academy Award for his 2010 score for the David Fincher flick, \\"The Social Network\\" and collaborating with his wife on the How to Destroy Angels project (releasing an EP and a full-length LP). Apparently all of those successes weren't enough as Reznor's heart belonged to his first love. This would explain why Nine Inch Nails were given a sudden resurrection and why their (his) seventh LP, \\"Hesitation Marks,\\" was secretly recorded behind closed doors with little to no fanfare.<br /><br />Sounds like: \\"With Teeth\\" without teeth.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- The finest production values, as only Reznor could provide.<br /><br />- A few genuinely groovy and innovative tracks, ala \\"All Time Low\\" and the new-wavey \\"Everything.\\"<br /><br />- Classic NIN sounds emerge in \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" and \\"in Two.\\"<br /><br />- Hey, Nine Inch Nails are back in the game. What else could you want?!<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Nothing here stands out from Trent's previous work(s), amounting to a glorified b-side collection<br /><br />- Would-be standouts \\"Copy Of A\\" and \\"Came Back Haunted\\" sound as if they were picked up off the cutting room floor during the \\"With Teeth\\"/\\"Year Zero\\" sessions.<br /><br />Hits:<br /><br />- \\"All Time Low,\\" \\"Copy of A,\\" \\"In Two\\" and \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" are about as close to \\"classic\\" NIN as the album gets.<br /><br />- \\"Everything\\" is as catchy as anything Reznor has produced in the past, even it may be the most polarizing moment of the entire affair.<br /><br />- The three remixes included with the deluxe edition as pretty groovy in their own right, surpassing their counterparts at times.<br /><br />Misses:<br /><br />- Album closer \\"While I'm Still Here\\" (discounting the instrumental \\"Black Noise\\") ends things on a rather bland and disjointed note.<br /><br />- While the album isn't terrible, it lacks one single, defining moment. It plays more like a string of ideas and experiments from the mind of Reznor.<br /><br />Best Listened to When: You've heard every single NIN album, EP, single, remix et al.<br /><br />Personally:<br /><br />It's hard not to get excited whenever Trent releases new music, but this is by far and away the most disappointing NIN release to date. Having said that, it still beats 99.99% of what passes for rock music these days.

B00873GRU4|4.0|Hugh Howey has set a great landscape for a very thought provoking story. Even some of today's various issues are addressed in this unthinkable future.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very addictive game.. my husband also has it on his phone and we compete to see who can get further.
B0073COMUW|2.0|Very objectionable color. I will try it out a little longer but it is really not acceptable.<br />I will revisit this review in a week or so and see if I change my mind.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|great flick depp is at his best,it a rollercoaster ride he's up,down up and down again,he is one of our best actors
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It tells you exactly what you need to know. How much battery life I have left on my Kindle to play games, read a book or go on the interweb.
B008Y7DWC4|5.0|This is a classic emotional ride from shocking images to outlandish buckets of multicolored blood. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys humor with their horror. This film is not to be taken seriously and is definitely not for the faint of heart. Great movie for a Halloween night. No children please!
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|Lots of fun and kids love playing with it.  Our pet really enjoys chasing it around the house.  Wish it was slightly cheaper since my 7 year old son is now asking me to buy him one of his own.
B00EU9VCKO|2.0|If you are 30+, your parents probably had an old school Kodak film camera. Remember all those all photographs tucked away in a box or photo album? The photos were dull, faded, fuzzy, imperfect. Now take your new digital photos and use this app to make them look like those old Kodak photos. I, personally don't really have a use for this app. But, it might be useful maybe for those generations of baby pictures that you want to compare.
B0015442YU|5.0|Can't imagine anyone else other than Anthony Hopkins in this role. Though the content is dark, and gets gruesome at times, I like it. The storyline is taught, you feel like its straight from the book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I downloaded this right after I got my HD and have logged hours playing it. Without a doubt, it is one of my absolute favorites so far.
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Absolutely stunning model, for 40 dollars though this model has some kind of weird painting texture I don't like up close yet when you're far it looks like a real Striker Eureka!  Everything is very detailed head to feet even in the back.  BE WARNED THAT YOU SHOULD NOT GET THIS MODEL FOR CHILDREN AS THE BLADES ON HIS ARMS ARE VERY SHARP AND POINTY! It's more of a model figurine to look at rather than to play!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|This album is brilliant from beginning to end.  The band once again does it again with great song after great song after great song.  I love this album.  My favorite song, and one I highly recommend you listen to is 'Still Into You' it's such a great song.  Buy this album, you won't regret it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app!  Using it on all of my devices.  Easy to use and navigate.  Nice nice, easy handy okay .. Nice on the eyes.
1416905014|5.0|Realized I wrote a review for the wrong book, and now I can't find out how to delete it! I'm waiting to recieve this book, since I just ordered it today, so I'll add a real review once I get it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't rate apps so that should say something right there. The app is amazingly winsome and I recommend this game to people who like minion rush and the temple runs. I hope this was helpful Iput a lot of time into it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. My friends and family love this game. We love this game. It is fun and is free.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I love this show.  I was hooked from beginning to end and couldn't get enough.  Tatiana Maslany is an A-List talent and she shows it every second she's in front of the camera.  Buy this show!  You will not regret it!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love Star Trek. I have watched everything from the original shows to now these new ones. This is a great movie. The cast is awesome. I am looking forward to a lot of movies they make. Great story and great action.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Just recently I did a factory reset on my tablet, I had a pretty good picture editing software on it. Since I did a reset I lost it. I noticed that the free app of the day on amazon had been XnRetro Pro, I decided to get it. There are no ads and there are soooo many things to do with the picture you select, I love it!! Hopefully I won't do another factory reset! :)
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|We all need to look at things upside down and backwards at times. This book explains exactly why we need that skill.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really like the game but not that you have to go thrum each photo so many times. its time consuming and a little addictive.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I don't remember much about the original, which was probably good because I didn't sit there comparing the two.  Overall a good movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is just the thing for a few minutes peace and quiet. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my phone and wouldn't be without it now. Very relaxing.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|Have enjoyed having these eps at my beck-and-call without having to search YouTube.  A couple of the satirical songs from the original broadcasts (i.e. &#34;Hey Jude&#34;) are probably missing due to licensing fees.  Exactly what I wanted, knew I was getting, and received.  For instance, it was made clear that the only DVD &#34;extra&#34; in this package was the full Footlights Review that won the Perrier Award.  Lots of bits of amusing nostalgia.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|If you like this movie, you will love the entire Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis tv series even more!  They changed the characters but it's even better. I hope they make a Stargate 2 movie.
B00FE5N09Y|4.0|By far my favorite tv show but why not blurry. I feel that just being on DVD ruins this amazing product!
B00913DPW2|5.0|I really love hidden object games and this game did not disappoint.<br />I will also be getting Haunt 2. very fun
B002RVZV9K|4.0|The bottom line here is that this is great, and worthy of your purchase. The problem with it is the third guy, Jack White. Who is he? Has anyone ever heard of that guy? He is a decent guitar player, although horrible singer. In the film they do these sections where they show one of the guys in his home, commenting on his work and influence. When that takes place with the Jack White guy you have to raise a cynical eyebrow, the \\"Who is this guy?\\" look. If they were able to get The Edge and Jimmy Page (both legends and geniuses, particularly Page) they could have gotten Jeff Beck, who is practically a brother to Jimmy Page. They could have gotten Eric Clapton too, maybe even Eddie Van Halen. Now THAT would have been the real deal, that: Three defining guitar men and the sounds they produced (Page, Van Halen, Edge). I guess the only downer there would have been that it would have made The Edge's genius seem less. But once again, this is great, even though the 4 stars I gave it could have been more.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Alter Bridge since they formed. If I had one issue it was that Tremonti was more about speed than feel. That has changed with Fortress! Kennedy's influence has benefited Tremonti in a hugely positive way. This band has arrived with an album that will awe most rock fans.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Loved this album from the first piano note played.  Updated & re-envisioned tracks just &#34;feel&#34; right as I relax or take a drive.  The title track is especially good (and lacks the scratching needle background from Booker's original).  Laurie has a pleasing baritone that attains that &#34;full blues roll&#34; needed for a lot of those down-and-dirty lyrics.  Whoa!  Dr. John is on here, too!  Tipitina, well, that's an absolute winning track.  The band is stunningly spot on.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this is the best game of my life with the pork side!now you can be<br />jango fett and emperor Palpatine!you can always choose your side!<br />now with jar jar and master yoda!
0446560065|5.0|What can I say, I'm a cat lover that fell in love with his Youtube animations and now this book. Must have for cat owners!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|So many of the more popular teen reads lately have featured heroines who aren't very good role models. While she certainly has a lot to learn and makes decisions without thinking them through, America takes responsibility for her poor choices and accepts the consequences. I don't agree with everything she does,but I admire her courage and willingness to stand up for what she believes in a society that frowns on the unconventional.
B001F6TXME|4.0|I tried the remote but you have to program your camera to use it.  With this it is just plug it in and shoot.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great fun, wish I could play longer, but run out of energy. My favorite hidden object game so far. Tempted to purchase crystals soon.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app allows me to create a mix of soft sounds that distract me from the noise created by my husband's CPAP machine.  At last, I can sleep!
B008FYZIVY|3.0|I purchased this item in May or June for a birthday present in July.. We didn't open the package until Oct. while on vacation.We started watching series 1, and when we got to disc 3, found it was cracked and unplayable.. At that time it was beyond the warranty limits. The cracked dvd left a void in the story line for us. It's a great series, and we're looking forward to season 4.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely loved it.  I started reading King at 16 years of age<br />And IT scared the living daylights out of me.  I have been a fan ever since. I recommend this book to all who enjoy a little horror in their life.  Can't wait for the next one Mr. KING
1595141979|5.0|The entire series is absolutely amazing! I especially loved this one book because of what happens with rose and dimitri.
B004GXZ69W|4.0|Positive Points:<br />Very easy install.<br />Each person can tweak the mouse-pointer settings to suit themselves.<br /><br />Negative Points:<br />I chose this &#34;small&#34; mouse that was reportedly a good fit for a woman's hand.  I can use it but it is larger than I expected.  The Evoluent  mouse should be smaller still for my hand.  The new mouse doesn't make my downtime game playing easier at all.  I switch back and forth from my regular mouse and the Evoluent.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|The Diving Board is excellent! Elton John's Vocals & Piano Playing are awesome! Tons of piano on the album. This is the album EJ fans have been asking for since the 70's. Elton & Bernie Taupin's songwriting on this album is excellent! Elton's music & Bernie's lyrics on this album show why they are the best songwriting team of all time. All 19 songs on the Deluxe CD are great! I can't decide which is my favorite song on the album because all the songs are so good. My favorite song changes every time I listen to the CD.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|No reason to write a review. I (that I can remember) had never heard of this book before Kindle/I-Pad.  This book won the Hugo, Nebula and other awards.<br />Good vs Evil, religious in ways hard to fathom, I can actually see this book being discussed in a college literature class.  Or even being used as a dissertation.  Possibly even a Doctorate?
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Learned this game from my grandson, and it is very fun. Puzzle and strategy at a relaxed pace. And fun to share with the grandkids! Highly recommended.
B001TH16DI|5.0|The clarity of image and sound are outstanding! This is a &#34;must have&#34; for all Trekkies! Kirk and Spock are like old friends to my heart.
031623480X|3.0|Grain Brain is another in a long line of low carb promoting diet and overall health, self help books. The unique angle with this one is the focus on brain health as opposed to the more traditional diabetes, cardiovascular disease, weight issues, etc. Perlmutter provides some solid evidence for the involvement of chronic inflammation as a co-conspirator for the development of central nervous system degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as simple cognitive decline. His advice, in the short version is admirable and hard to argue with: reduce dietary carb intake, especially grains; get some exercise; get enough sleep. Most of his supplement advice is reasonable, although there is little actual data upon which to judge. Overall, in terms of specifics, this is just another low carb guide with perhaps a bit more scientific justification with regards to the impact of inflammation which has been an emerging theme in medicine for the past decade.<br /><br />Where Perlmutter falls a bit short is the direct connection between dietary carbs (and specifically grains) and the promotion of chronic inflammation with gluten reactivity being the culprit. While the Cyrex test may be useful for persons exhibiting specific symptoms, especially celiac disease, there's little scientific evidence for the array of gluten specific responses driving systemic inflammation. Nor does Perlmutter outline whether changes in those antibody levels are prognostic. It is possible that gluten reactivity may merely indicate past exposure to grains without any long term health consequences. This in no way invalidates the significance of the involvement of chronic inflammation in these myriad disease process, but only questions the contribution of gluten.<br /><br />As far as supplements go, the vitamin D and DHA advice is probably sound, but recommendations for some others is questionable. Resveratrol in particular is tricky as the level of supplementation is unlikely sufficient to impact sirtuins which are outlined as its main purpose. Like is mentioned for statins, we may learn that the true molecular target is different from first believed. In addition, recent evidence has suggested that resveratrol may blunt the benefits that accrue from exercise. This could be a dosage effect, but it may also suggest that resveratrol is too powerful as an antioxidant eliminating even the acute inflammation that exercise appears to promote for beneficial training effects. In addition, curcumin while desirable has almost no oral uptake unless combined with piperine (black pepper). Without this caveat, curcumin supplementation is worthless.<br /><br />Overall, this book details the gradual evolution in dietary advice. Back in Atkins' day, low carb was simply a means for weight loss. The next generation of Zone, Eades, South Beach, etc focused on low carb for controlling insulin resistance which became a unifying theme connecting multiple chronic diseases. Now, chronic inflammation is becoming the next theme to provide a new theory of everything for all chronic diseases. Regardless of whatever comes next, the general advice of carb control especially with reduction in refined grains and sugars, plenty of exercise, and a good night's sleep will always yield positive results.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Hey it's Sunnydale Girl here! I used the song from the movie (that I happily just got on my kindle) And had to write a review for this! I am some pretty decent fairytale movies, all Gothic types, I grew out of Disney YEARS ago, although I still like how The princess (and we're talking animated here, since those were the ones I watched the most.) Always got her Prince. And that's what this review is about. So let's start with how this was written (cause I did read the book as well. 1st off I have to say, the book isn't better. In fact the ending is confusing. (And not That I don't love to read, cause I do....but just cause a movie HAS a book, Does not mean the book WILL be better, even my Grandparents agree with me on this. I would like to point out something, if you HAVEN'T read it.....the book ending is actually the MOVIES alternate ending ( it's a little different of course...minor details.....but one of the strangest the book has....is he still has fur (now I'm not saying that's bad...I like it even it makes me think of old werewolf (and yes I know he's NOT a werewolf) movies of the 80s. BUT....I do like the tattoos more, I mean it's a cool spell where different parts of the tattoos come to life, I even completed a fanfic Challenge once, crossing this over with The Goblin King from Labryinth making him...Ziggy Stardust ( I know easy, but it turned out great....I made him Kendras match after he hurt Sarah) And Kendra...is my favorite character in the film.....I love her clothes, and how she's REALLY like this cool outcast (even though she's a,witch) and I love that at the same time her spell was to help the guy....and he ended up living happily ever a free with his girl.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great read. One of the more insightful books I've ever read. Each character is so vividly described and the text begs the question, what would you do. I loved it!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved eat pray love & was concerned this couldn't measure up! So glad I was wrong. Completely different but was drawn in & couldn't put it down Gilbert is a genius!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I wanted an easy game to play, one that I could relax with in between classes. This one fits and I like the graphics! It was worth installing on my Kindle.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This follow up is full of great action and the development of the characters.  Superb &#34;remake&#34; of &#34;ST2: Wrath of Kahn&#34;.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli has a a wonderful and expressive voice - I love to hear him sing - It lifts my spirits.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really like it and it was so easy to install and it made watching movie a lot easier to watch
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love how u don't need energy to play the game and the animals make funny noises when u click on them
B000JMKQX0|5.0|i wish the movie had used more than just the book's title.  This was an immersion into an Apocalyptic aftermath.  Well done.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Lep is really cute. It's a really fun game. The controls work surprisingly well. I wish there was a quick overview of the controls, because at first I didn't know I had acorns. I didn't figure out until level 2 or 3 that they were there and how to use them. The controls took a few minutes to get a hang of, but after that everything's been running smoothly.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|August 16, 2013 was the 125th Anniversary of the birth of Thomas Edward Lawrence. This Blu-ray edition has a lot of extras and the movie has been restored to the finest degree.  It takes you back to the day when men were men and leaders were men who you could be proud of. A real &#34;must have&#34; for classic movie lovers.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I downloaded this game for my son on his Nabi 2.  He likes it and it's not too complicated for him to play alone.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because I think this game is really only for kids and doesn't involve ANY variety in the levels (that I've seen so far).  Perfect for having on your phone or tablet for some quick entertainment for the little ones.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses. This game was recommends to me by my friend, and I love it!! I would recommend it for anyone that loves animals and likes to take care of them, especially horses.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's pretty much the standard series that scifi movies try to live up to. What more is their to say
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Entertainment in short spurts . it so far. Easy to do and was nice to be able e easy to get neighbors to visit.  Like that it ok s free<br />.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast was easy to setup and wonderful to use. I linked it to both laptops and Samsung Galaxy S3. Picture and sound work great and I can complete other tasks on computer or phone while watching.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Blu-ray brings all the action to life. Rocky is the best, ever! I still cry when Mick dies. Balboa lives in the heart of all Americans.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutely love this game, definitely worth the 99 cent price tag.  My son is 6-years-old and we got this for his Nabi 2 and he plays it all of the time.<br /><br />It has challenges that require the player to use their imagination and come up with word combinations (that come to life in the game!) to solve them .  Simple enough for a 1st grader, but still a lot of fun for an adult.  So far it's been able to create everything he's come up with.  While being fun it also teaches kids problem solving, AND helps improve their spelling!!!!  Great buy!<br /><br />It says all ages, but don't expect your child to be able to play it on their own if they can't read or write at a basic level.  My 1st grader started playing it last year in Kindergarten (with help), but has much more fun with it on his own now in 1st grade.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thrilling exciting. Nice cliff hanger. Enjoyed the characters. Cannot wait for the next book. Hope the anxiety level remains high.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|The charger only worked for a few days and then it stopped working so I had to order a new one. I was very disappointed. I have another griffin charger just like it that I ordered off Amazon too and it works great and I love it! But this doesn't work at all. Whenever I plug it into my phone, my phone says charging isn't supported with that accessory.
0345529057|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He loves the books, and I bought him this set on sale. The price was great, and they were delivered promptly.<br /><br />I can't really comment on the content, since I haven't read them. However, if you want to buy these books, this is a nice set.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game, my 5 year old and I play slot. My characters have got deleted some how and would really like them back.  Having a physically challenge child didn't like change. So when reading this I would hope you can help me too.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Well, it's been over a week now since I have been able to use Kindle on my LG phone. It does no good to contact customer service/tech support. My husband called over a week ago and was told that they would call back...still waiting. The app still crashes when attempting to open it. Uninstalling/re-installing doesn't help; we've done that twice. Amazon/Kindle doesn't seem to be taking this issue very seriously. I feel sorry for those who have invested a lot money, not only in the Kindle device but in books, who cannot read them. The really stupid thing about the whole mess is that you cannot uninstall the latest update - there is no option to do that. If that were the case it might make a difference. So, beware. DO NOT UPDATE TO THE LATEST VERSION 4.2.0.54. This used to be a five-star app but not anymore.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Excellent bluetooth. I did not think that it would work with the LG bluetooth headset but, it does very well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love the puzzle and hidden object combination in this game. I'm older but my 11 and 25 year old daughters love it, too. If one gets stuck they get the other to help and some we all do together just for fun. More levels please!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Don't let the subtitles fool you. This is a terrific and inventive movie. Highly recommended. Not family friendly though so don't watch with children under 16.
B004YM6JLO|2.0|I liked the first 2 seasons of The Vampire Diaries, but this season has completely \\"jumped the shark\\", \\"gone off the rails\\" or whatever phrase you want to use for this incredibly LAME season. The whole \\"Doppelganger\\" thing with Elena is beyond silly, but the dumbest plotline by far has to do with Alaric. Just HOW many times is this man going to die? His sudden Jekyll/Hyde alter ego is ridiculous when there was no build-up to it at all. Besides that, there are so many other minor plotlines going on with each character that the show totally loses it's cohesiveness and tension. It's very hard as a viewer to stay invested and interested in the characters when you can barely keep track of who is a vampire, werewolf, or hybrid THIS time, since so many people are being changed into supernatural beings. Take the character of Tyler, who started out as a normal 17-year-old boy, but THEN becomes a werewolf, and THEN becomes a werewolf/vampire hybrid....seriously? Clearly the writers just gave up early on in the season! I'm surprised they didn't whip up a plot with a time-machine...it wouldn't be any stupider than the rest of the plotlines in this season. Somebody needs to tell the writers that an excessively convoluted plotline does not make a show more exciting, - it only makes that show more annoying. The key to good writing is this maxim: \\"A simple story, told well\\". The writers need to go back to focusing on the love triangle between Damon, Elena and Stefan without all of this other garbage thrown in. Happily, Season 4 gets the show back on track.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest is the best site ever!!!!! teaches and shows you anything and  everything you need so you can do projects on your own. I actually have my own lil hobbies now!! not to mention the recipes!!! LOVE U PINTREST!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive and fun to play thank God it's free but if we had to pay it would be worth it
B008Y212PI|5.0|I would have to say that this game is great. It is very very additive. I could sit and play it for hours!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie was soooooooooo romantic. I had a movie night with the boyfriend . I absolutely loved it , he did too :)
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I honestly do not understand why people are so down on this movie.  I thought it was beautifully filmed, and the storyline of father and son was superb.  Had tears in my eyes at the end.  So what- Jaden Smith was not as good an actor as his dad. Big surprise!  LIGHTEN UP!  He was perfectly fine.  And pretty good for a 14 year old. I was not disappointed for a single minute. Highly recommended. Action and emotion beautifully combined.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|While this app was quite good, the most recent update destroyed any ability to return to a bookmark. I mark a page with a bookmark, explore another part of the book & ther is no easy way I know of to return to any bookmark. Please fix it!
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|yes free app of the day i have been waiting for this for a long time now i would definetely recommend this to anyone who asked me so five stars all the way
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Like it.  This is a good free alarm clock. Lots of options and works well on the night strand. Recommend it for those looking for something free to get them up in the AM.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Typical Reacher fashion, walk in, kick ass and walk into the sunset. Great book. I'm ready for number thirteen now!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is a magical mystery! Thanks to my friends who had read the book and did not spoil it for me. They were right by saying: &#34;It's not what you think!&#34; The visuals the author paints for her readers defy description. Reading The Night Circus is more like walking through an art gallery of intricate, whimsical 3-D  pieces, than reading a novel. Every set designer in the world will want to make this into a film. I hope you have as much fun as I did!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I Highly recommend this book, page turner- lots of twists and turns.  Will continue to buy his other books and continue the silo saga.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|The Kindle droid app is terrible. It is excrutiatingly slow to load when it does load and half the time just causes my phone to reboot. I am thinking about buying a dedicated Kindle but what if it behaves the same way?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been reading a lot of new authors recently and have found several I really enjoy, but when you read Stephen King you're reminded what great writing really is. This is one of those really long books that just flies by. Great characters in a timeless story. I'll be back for a second reading in the not too distant future.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is the best cd ever! I love it! One thing I don't like though was how they only had 2 people sing the song by Kelly Clarkson instead of all the people in the auditions.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|We'd heard the hype, and how well this movie had done over the summer, so when it became available, we decided to give it a look. The most positive thing I can say about renting it is it saved us the cost of going to the theater to see it, and we didn't have to shell out the bucks to own it. It's worth a look, but that's about it.  It did hold my interest, but my wife only barely made it through, fighting off Mr. Sandman about halfway through. As has been covered in detail in other reviews, there is a lot - a LOT - that you have to be willing to overlook; an eager willingness to suspend your disbelief is needed to get you through this movie. Oh, sure, if you want to accept every premise and every scenario without question or analysis, then I can see why you'd like this movie. But if you have even a slightly critical eye, you're going to spot the plot holes and improbabilities from a mile away, and many of them will nag at you throughout the movie. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say that there's at least a half-dozen spots I can think of off the top of my head where you'll find yourself saying, \\"Really? You really want me to believe that?\\"  All that said, if you are in the mood for some really well-done zombies, and an improbable round-the-world hunt for a cure for those zombies, and you don't mind putting logic and reason on the shelf for a couple of hours, then give this movie a shot. Just don't say I didn't warn you.
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|Stupid, boring script. A total waste of money. There was better writing on Saturday morning cartoons in the 70's than this piece of trash. Writers gave one of Marvel's best characters a storyline more worthy of a cheezy sci-fi show from the 50's.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love the style of writing, the details of each character without long , boring sentences.  And I loved how intricately woven their lives were.  The way the author revealed each character by first describing them and their situation, but also their thoughts made me feel I knew them- like I could really identify with them.  The epilogue was great!  I'm going to read more of the authors works.  Thanks for the best book I've read in a long time!

B00ENXBUR2|1.0|My problem is not that Man of Steel is a bad movie. My problem is that Man of Steel is a TERRIBLE movie that, for some inscrutable reason, people seem to think was good. Goyer seems to have forgotten the rule in writing &#34;show, don't tell.&#34; This movie is full of subplots that go nowhere, flashbacks that serve no narrative purpose, good actors going completely to waste, and action set pieces that drag on for so long that the action actually becomes boring. The cast is amazing, but the actors have nothing to work with because there is nothing resembling actual characters in this movie. People just go through the motions that we're supposed to expect from Superman-related characters, but none of it feels genuine or earned, and there is no character development of any kind, no actual arc at all. The entire second half of the film is one long action sequence that is so repetitive that I was begging for it to be over. I love myself some gratuitous explosions, don't get me wrong, but there is so little variation in the action, and the action does little to nothing in the way of advancing the story, that it became tedious. The audience should never be bored when godlike superbeings are duking it out with the fate of the world in the balance, but I was. The movie is not without some good features. As I said, the cast is excellent; visually, it's very pretty; the music is fine, if a bit forgettable (not as iconic as John Williams's Superman theme, or Danny Elfman's Batman, or Hans Zimmer's earlier work on the Dark Knight trilogy). Where this movie failed was in the writing. I've come to expect much better from David S. Goyer. This is some of his worst work, worse than The Crow 2, worse than the David Hasselhoff Nick Fury movie. I guess I should have had lower expectations because of Zack Snyder, because this movie is consistent with his level of work. It was worse than Watchmen, but not as bad as Suckerpunch.  It blows my mind whenever I call Man of Steel the biggest cinematic disappointment of the summer and people look at me like I'm crazy. I will never understand how anyone over the age of 10 came away from this movie satisfied.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A fresh and interesting yarn. A cross between science fiction and doomsday fantasy, WOOL KEEPS the reader turning virtual pages. Be warned though; Howey is not shy about killing off important characters in furtherance of the plot line!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I purchased this book based on a recommendation.  I was looking forward to reading it, and I had high expectations. What a waste of my time. I forced myself to read it, along the way yelling at the assumptions, misconceptions, gross  mischaracterization, and out right lies from a man who claims to be a religious scholar.<br /><br />To claim that Jesus Christ was nothing more than one in a long line of political zealots attempting to raise an army to over-through the Roman government was nothing more than Anti-Christian rhetoric and hogwash!<br /><br />Mr. Asian went to great lengths to distort New  Testament scripture, to rip the words out of the mouths of New Testament writers, and to try and change not only the words of Jesus, the Apostles and Paul, but to explain what these men really meant, and how they couldn't possibly have said and written what they did.<br /><br />This was the most outrageous example of re-writing history that I have ever seen!  It was a total waste of my time. I kept reading because I hoped that somehow the author would get to the end and have another conversion experience back to Christian, after all he claims he went from Muslim to Christian and back to Muslim again, so it wouldn't be too far fetched to think that he could just continue on his conversion and re-conversion experience. And this would fulfill a New Testament prophesy that in the last days men would be ever learning but never come to a knowledge of the truth!<br /><br />If you have money to waste and you enjoy reading FICTION based on lies, then you will love this book! But if you are looking for something that is truthful and thought provoking, look elsewhere because you won't find it in this book!
1908538090|5.0|I am interested in History, because those who don't know history are bound to repeat its mistakes.This was a very interesting read into the life of the Hitler in his own words. The society at his time and the things that happened seem to be similar to what is happening in America.<br /><br />It has great pictures with captions. If you are looking for a version of Mein Kampf, I highly recommend this one.

B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Don't watch the trailer or read anything about this before you watch it. It is one of those movies that is designed to keep you on your toes. It is, for all intents and purposes, a cross between Men in Black, the best cop movies, the best cowboy movies, Ghostbusters, The Matrix, and the best Pixar/Disney Animations.  It is not for kids because of the violence and some language. Jeff Bridges is hilarious. Ryan Reynolds plays a great straight man to Bridges. Kevin Bacon shows his range of acting in a movie one would not expect to see him in. The movie is very fast moving and if you blink you WILL miss something. Lots of graphics and sight gags make this a must-see popcorn or pizza movie!<br /><br />Are you going to \\"learn\\" anything from it?  No. Folks, it is a freaking MOVIE. Don't get caught up in the topic of the afterlife. Suspend your personal beliefs (Movie Going 101) and just enjoy this epic comic offering.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|In a year or two, I won't be surprised if I see \\"Captain Phillips\\" bundled together with \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  It makes sense:  both deal with American encounters with Somalis and Somalia and both are superb, nail-bitingly intense stories that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br /><br />The story centers around Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks in a performance that I bet gets him an Academy Award or at least a nomination for one).  The real-life Phillips was the master of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked in 2009 by Somali pirates.  Phillips found himself adrift in a lifeboat with the pirates heading for Somalia until the US Navy decisively intervened.<br /><br />Besides Tom Hanks' standout performance as Phillips, the movie has multiple strong points:<br /><br />1.  The realism is very strong.  I found the sequence of scenes where the pirates chased and boarded the ship to be particularly convincing (it seems a real ship was used for much of it and if there were any CGI effects they were seamlessly integrated into the mix).  The stand-off on the high seas between the pirates and the Navy was another strong point (given the apparent participation of the US Navy in making the film).<br /><br />2.  The movie made the Somali pirates three-dimensional human beings instead of cardboard villains, but it didn't go overboard by even slightly attempting to excuse their despicable behavior.  The Somali actors playing them did a great job portraying desperate men who were willing to commit murder and terrorize people who had done nothing wrong to them for money.<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />3.  The movie also deserves praise for its depiction of how Phillips reacted to his ordeal.  Up until the point where the pirates were shot dead, he had shown a great deal of composure and cool-headed thinking.  But in the immediate aftermath of his rescue, guess what?  He went into shock.  How many times have we seen movies where the hero or heroine undergoes some sort of horrific ordeal and displays no evidence of that in its aftermath? Hank's showing Phillips having an emotional and physiological collapse after being held at gunpoint, threatened, abducted, and brutally beaten over a prolonged period, made the movie viscerally \\"real\\" to me.<br /><br />The film is not perfect.  I thought the first couple of minutes where Phillips drove to the airport from his home in the US with his wife was pretty dull, and given the fact that they didn't show any scenes with his wife or family after that, it was pretty pointless.  Another criticism I would have would be that the film didn't explain why after the first attempt by the pirates to hijack the ship was reported, there was no real response to the authorities.  But those are minor criticisms.  Bottom line:  this is a terrific movie.  I plan to see it again in the theaters, and I know I will be adding it to my DVD library.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />Here are some books I'd suggest looking into reading to get a better understanding of Somalia and piracy.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307476561 The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden World]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1569763119 Pirate State: Inside Somalia's Terrorism at Sea]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0306821176 The World's Most Dangerous Place: Inside the Outlaw State of Somalia]]ine undergoes some sort of horrific ordeal and displays no evidence of that in its aftermath?

0684824906|5.0|This is a fascinating tale, one that I must recommend at the outset of these comments.  We know much about Lincoln but little has been written with the depth of this author's words.  It is said that she spent ten years preparing for the novel.  I was pleased to see that she included Lincoln's political mistakes as well as his successes.  It helps us understand the difficulty of the presidency as well as the very human aspects of the decisions the man who occupies the office makes.<br /><br />I can't help but recall what I have learned about Lincoln throughout my life which is but a tiny view of a complex, shrewd, intelligent, and compassionate individual.  His life and practice as a lawyer were vital to his success as a man and a president.  Of course, all of his rivals were lawyers as well and, in the view of many of that time, more qualified to become president.<br /><br />When Lincoln was elected against all odds he recruited his rivals to form a group that he felt was strong enough to lead the nation toward the future.  He understood and respected these brave opinionated men that he recruited for their individual strengths to work for the nation that they all loved.  These men formed a cabinet of strong opinionated men who had a lasting impact on the Civil War, our history, and his presidency.  Stanton was recruited to be secretary of war.  Seward became secretary of state and Chase, head of the department of treasury. Edward Bates was named attorney general.<br /><br />The theme, Team of Rivals, is well chosen because the team bonded together in the face of adversity to lead our country through perilous times. It is a surreal but true history.<br /><br />What a man this president was! So strong, so honest, so caring, so wise. Wow!  How I wish I had known him.  Yes, this is a book to read again and again.  A keeper for certain.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Hyper 212 Plus lowered my CPU temperature by a staggering 15C (that's 59F!) over my previous (basically) stock heatsink. I did add another fan to it with the included brackets. This did fit in my case without blocking RAM or any other vital components.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the included fan is LOUD... like turbine loud. Just buy another 120mm fan that's quieter and replace the included fan with it, and you'll be set. Also, if your case has a spot for a side panel fan anywhere near where this thing sits, you can forget about using them. Luckily, my case has 2 spots, one of which is low enough to clear the heatsink. YMMV.<br /><br />I most definitely recommend this heatsink, along with Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste (I didn't use the included thermal paste, so I can't attest to its effectiveness). A 15C is absolutely insane, and I don't think you're going to find a better buy without moving up to water cooling.

1476727651|5.0|The Turning Point: Doctor Sleep by Stephen King<br />By Marc D. Goldfinger<br />“We stood at the turning point.  Half-measures availed us nothing.” The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous<br /><br />I’ve been reading Stephen King since I was young.  Let me make this clear: young is a variable for me.  The first book I ever read by Stephen King was The Stand, a book of about 800 pages.  It was supposed to be longer but King’s publisher didn’t think a book that ran over 1100 pages would sell, so they asked King to cut, cut, cut, but no pasting, until they felt it was marketable.<br /><br />The ravaged version, which, by the way, was great, came out in 1978.  Years later, when King’s popularity was peaking, they released the full version.  This was in 1990.  It is now 2013 and Stephen King, after completing his magnum opus called The Dark Tower, is at his best.<br /><br />King’s newest book, Doctor Sleep, was just released (528 pages).  Way back when King was starting out, he wrote a book called The Shining, which was later made into movie starring Jack Nicholson.  My guess would be that more people saw the movie than read the book, although the book sold quite well.  The Shining has 447 pages, which makes it one of King’s shorter novels.<br /><br />To appreciate Doctor Sleep, one does not need to go back and read The Shining, however, it might add some flavor to the experience. Loosely speaking, they are sequential.<br /><br />The main character in Doctor Sleep is Dan Torrance.  He is in his early 30’s in Doctor Sleep; in The Shining Dan Torrance is a little boy who sees more than the normal person.  To be hyper-aware is not always a gift.  If you can shake someone’s hand and see their imminent death, it’s hard to smile and say, “Have a good day and it was nice to meet you.”<br /><br />As an avid reader, I hate book reviews that spoil the fun, if that would be the proper word to use for one of Stephen King’s books.  I find myself faced with a conundrum. I don’t want to spoil Doctor Sleep. But I do want to tell you why I think it is Stephen King’s best book.<br /><br />It’s quite different than his 7 book Dark Tower series- which is the modern Lord of the Rings.  But Doctor Sleep touched me in a very special way.<br /><br />If you happen to be an alcoholic in recovery, you will love Doctor Sleep.  Boy, I put myself out on a limb there, didn’t I?  But really, I mean it.  Even if you’ve never read a King book before, if you are in recovery, just pick it up and read the first ten pages, including the quotes at the beginning of the book.<br /><br /> I’ll go one step further.  If you’re an alcoholic or a drug addict who is still using but doesn’t want to use anymore, pick up Doctor Sleep and read it.  Then go to an AA meeting or an NA meeting.  You don’t have to wait until you finish the book.  After all, you’ll want to be sober enough to remember the damn thing, right?<br /><br />Just like Dan Torrance had the Shining when he was a child, in Doctor Sleep there is a little girl named Abra Stone who Shines like the sun.  She’s got some power, all to the good.<br /><br />There are other folks cruising down the highways and byways of America.  You’ve probably seen them in their big RV’s, mostly retired people who are past their mid-sixties.  Looks are deceiving my friend.  Just like there are motorcycle clubs called The Devil’s Disciples, it could be that not all of these old folks have warmth in their hearts.<br /><br />There is a gang of them that calls themselves The True Knot and they hunger to live.  What they need is children who Shine and, just like vampires drink blood, these folks drink the Essence of the children.  No, no, the children don’t survive.  The True Knot has been around a long time.  They traveled in covered wagons back in the day.<br /><br />And, just like true Bikers, these folks have names like Steamhead Steve, Black-eyed Susie, Diesel Doug, & Steve the Chink,who is not Chinese.  Their leader is a big woman who wears a sinister top hat and they call her Rosie the Hat.<br /><br />They don’t like dogs and dogs don’t like them but they love children.  Children who Shine.  You know that statement from the old rock songs, “you always hurt the one you love”.  The True Knot does just that.<br /><br />Abra Stone picked up on The True Knot when they were draining the Steam from this young man, about 12 years old and never to see another birthday—she hooked in on what they were doing with her Shining and began to scream as she pulled away.<br /><br />Not quick enough.  Rosie the Hat sensed her and knew that, whoever that young girl was, she was definitely a large store of food for The True Knot.  And that’s all I can say about that because I don’t want to ruin the story for you.<br /><br />Dan Torrance, who we talked about before, has a job to do.  When the teacher is ready, the student will appear.  That’s an old saying.  I don’t even know where it came from but it definitely applies here.  But this is enough about Doctor Sleep.  I’ve probably told you more than you want to know.  This is Stephen King at his best and his heart is really in this book.<br /><br />All of us, one way or another, reach a turning point in our lives and we either take the path we were meant to take—or we slip down the dark road.  I’ll have to say that I was lucky and took the right path after 30 years of dark road.  But it’s never too late for anyone as long as they are alive.<br /><br />Now I get to read and collect these books, of which Doctor Sleep is one.  Even if you don’t like to read Stephen King, this is the book to jump on.  If you like it, pass it on.  If you don’t like it, well write to me and complain.  I’ll hear you out.<br /><br />But watch out for caravans of RV’s with those bumper stickers that say “Old but not dead, save Medicare, I’m a conservative and I vote.”  You never know whether they’re out hunting or Sight-seeing.<br /><br />Oh, Doctor Sleep works in a Hospice.  We come to find that the ties that bind a family together are stronger than we believe.  The truth is always just one stranger away.<br /><br />Whether you are a friend of Bill’s or just a close cousin, this is not a book to miss.<br />_”DoctorSleepBook.com”—SimonandShuster.com”who is not Chinese.

And that’s all I can say about that because I don’t want to ruin the story for you.<br /><br />Dan Torrance, who we talked about before, has a job to do.  When the teacher is ready, the student will appear.  That’s an old saying.  I don’t even know where it came from but it definitely applies here.  But this is enough about Doctor Sleep.  I’ve probably told you more than you want to know.  This is Stephen King at his best and his heart is really in this book.<br /><br />All of us, one way or another, reach a turning point in our lives and we either take the path we were meant to take—or we slip down the dark road.  I’ll have to say that I was lucky and took the right path after 30 years of dark road.  But it’s never too late for anyone as long as they are alive.<br /><br />Now I get to read and collect these books, of which Doctor Sleep is one.  Even if you don’t like to read Stephen King, this is the book to jump on.  If you like it, pass it on.  If you don’t like it, well write to me and complain.  I’ll hear you out.<br /><br />But watch out for caravans of RV’s with those bumper stickers that say “Old but not dead, save Medicare, I’m a conservative and I vote.”  You never know whether they’reout hunting or Sight-seeing.<br /><br />Oh, Doctor Sleep works in a Hospice.  We come to find that the ties that bind a family together are stronger than we believe.  The truth is always just one stranger away.<br /><br />Whether you are a friend of Bill’s or just a close cousin, this is not a book to miss.<br />_”DoctorSleepBook.com”—SimonandShuster.com”

B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|Excellent acting by all parties.  A blunt look at the earlier efforts of one doctor to not only help orphans, but women who sought skilled medical assistance to end unwanted pregancies in a time when it was not only dangerous, but also illegal.  The characters of Fuzzy and Curly were well thought out and emphasized the pain of a child being looked over repeatedly for adoption in lieu of a younger or cuter child.  The movie also touches heavily on the impact of a woman who's fiance has gone to war, and the affair she has with the main character.  Very much worth investing your time for an afternoon or evening.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|I read all the negative reviews about this movie and about Will Smith's son, who stars in the movie with him.  I was prepared for the worst.  And yet....the movie is not terrible.  However, if that assessment sounds like it is lacking in enthusiasm, you are correct.<br /><br />First, a premise:  It is 1000 years after earth as we know it...due to some global cataclysm.  Will Smith (Cypher) plays a \\"ranger\\" in this movie, and his 14 year old son (Kitai) wants desperately to also be a ranger, so he can please his tough military like dad.<br /><br />In the movie, Cypher and Kitai crash land on a planet (Oh what a surprise...it happens to be earth!) and are the only two people left alive on the ship.  Cypher is badly hurt, and can not move.  So it is up to his son to \\"man up\\" and travel through the treacherous jungles of after earth - jungles that are full of dangerous newly-evolved creatures - to get to the other part of the crashed ship and retrieve the beacon, which will save both of their lives.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to add...there is a creature that has escaped it's cage onboard the ship....a creature that has evolved to kill humans,and will track them down due to their \\"fear pheromes.\\"  Evidently, the creature is used to \\"train\\" rangers, so they can learn to hide their fear (?)<br /><br />Anyway, Will Smith, the father, guides his son on his jungle journey through technology that allows him to see what the son sees.<br /><br />Does the son meet his doom in the jungle?  Will he be able to hide his fear and avoid being eaten by the escaped creature? Will the dad survive?  Will the son ever impress his dad?  I will let you watch the movie and find out.<br /><br />My opinion:  The movie was watchable.  I wasn't bored.  And yet....I think the plot was a bit \\"thin.\\"  There were no real surprises...no clever twists or turns.  No \\"OH WOW, I wasn't expecting that!\\" moments.  I probably would not watch the movie again, but who knows?  Maybe if a few years go by, I might.<br /><br />I don't believe the movie deserves all the bad reviews it's gotten.  I think the acting was perfectly adequate.  Some say the movie takes itself \\"too seriously,\\" and maybe that's true.  It could have used some more character development and humor, certainly.  However, the father in the movie was not supposed to be a light and jolly fellow.  He was having trouble connecting with his son, and that was a big part of the plot.<br /><br />I say, give the movie a try.  I think teen boys might like it (although I'm not sure.  I'm not a teen boy)!  Don't let the negative reviews keep you away...form your own opinion!  Watch with an open mind.  You might be surprised.br /><br />I don't believe the movie deserves all the bad reviews it's gotten.  I think the acting was perfectly adequate.

0451418441|5.0|This book was a great follow-up to &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;. It is the story about how the same families faired a couple of hundred years down the road. I thoroughly enjoyed both books.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Another solid outing from Sanderson. This one is a bit different from what we're used to - more along the lines of The Rithmatist than Way of Kings or Mistborn.<br /><br />I was pretty skeptical for the first 50 pages or so. The writing style takes a little getting used to as this book is very much written from the perspective (and thought process) of a teenager. There were plenty of awkward and goofy portions that made me cringe. If you can look past those and embrace the style that Sanderson is going for, I think it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />This is a pretty easy read, but that shouldn't take anything away from it. I wasn't blown away by the complexity but was still very eager to find out how it ended. There are quite a few questions answered and plot lines wrapped up in the final pages, all of which I was very pleased with. It even offers a bit of a cliffhanger to get you looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />Bravo, and hurry up with Words of Radiance please!
B0072OFM28|3.0|Where do I begin? With Blood and Sand, and Gods of the Arena.....I couldn't get enough of Spartacus! It was a non-stop, thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride that kept you coming back. It seemed like every actor chosen was poured into the role. The plot was solid and the actors made it believable!!  Enter &#34;Spartacus Vengeance&#34;. What can I say? It was a total disappointment! McIntyre is NOT Spartacus! The whole plot becomes a mish-mash of bad acting and nonsensical twists! Most of the new characters were poorly cast. Take for example Spartacus' love interest. The chick was HIGHLY annoying; her poor acting....her forced accent....her rat-like appearance....and the fact that a 90lb woman can suddenly fight and defeat well-trained Roman Soldiers. Worse yet, she takes a few archery lessons and she's a veritable Robin Hood! Yeah, THAT'S believable!! Hell, they didn't even cast the same girl who played &#34;Nevea&#34; in the first two seasons...leaving us instead with a lanky, dreadful, big-lipped, acting-school flunky stand-in who does little more than scream and look like a wet dog in every scene! Who were the producers trying to fool??!!!! On top of that....this scared little waif manages to defeat a gladiator and legions of Romans, all with a few weeks of training! What a CROCK!!! And then there's the blond German girl!! Oh yeah...there's another one that apparently can defeat men twice her size and can take punches like a man can, all: a) without bleeding b) never getting knocked out c) beating every man she fights and d) forcing us to believe she's tough! Who in the hell were the producers and casting directors thinking when they cast these three bimbos! Rat-girl and Ghetto-slave truly RUINED the show! You'll see!!   And then there's McIntyre himself! I'm sorry...but anyone who wears that much eyeliner has no business being a gladiator!! His darker voice, heavier accent, forced performance....it ALL played into the demise of this once-great show!!! He gives a forced speech for every little thing, and like clockwork, his followers cheer on cue!  Heed the warnings about what others have written....the other characters now upstage Spartacus himself. They have to! McIntyre was a valiant attempt....but it fell flat early on through this season, and gets worse in War of the Damned! Its only salvation was that Crixus, Anameus, Gannicus, Glaber, Illythia and Lucretia stayed with the show...because they had to carry it! This show and all characters should've been killed off when Whitfield passed away. It was a travesty to see such a great show die at the hands of these terrible additions!   The only reason I gave it three stars is because the CGI is still great. The violence is almost TOO gratuitous, as was the sex! ..Unfortunately neither could save this season!  Save your money! Either borrow it from someone you know or rent it. Better yet, buy both seasons of HBO's &#34;Rome&#34;!!! It's what Spartacus was patterned after. Either way, save your money....or regretfully, you'll remember my review!!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Kingdom Rush started as an app for Chrome and I played it for quite a while when I first found it. Being able to play it all over again on the Fire HD is great.<br /><br />This game has a number of interesting aspects to it that most TD games do not and is much more enjoyable and complex as a result. For two dollars you really can't go wrong.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is soooooo fun!! One thing tho how do u duck?? Its so awesome and if u love addicting games this is for u BUCCO!

B000QK7YQ2|5.0|I loved this movie - I was just a youngster when this movie came out, but my connection with 1971 was that was the year of my first bike: a Yamaha 360 - what a beast! I rode out in the So Ca deserts wearing my Malcolm Smith jacket (which I still have!), and even ran the Barstow to Vegas (it was called a 'trail ride' that year). I now live in Utah and fly paragliders and hang gliders at the Point of the Mountain - the site of the Widow-Maker! I still have and love to ride in the desert, and bought bikes for my kids so they could experience all the fun I've had. Great times - great friends - great fun!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It is one of the best apps i have ever usssseeeedddd!<br /><br />So good i love it so muchh lov iiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttt

B005D9MUWY|1.0|Update broke it. Keyboard does not appear on screen at all. Used swift key since day one and am rather disappointed at the sudden lack of testing.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The fact that my best friend got me to be a Gerard Butler fan was awesome! Finally I just got tired of borrowing this movie from her... so I bought it myself....<br /><br />Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007HACDLK|4.0|Unfortunately, Vince Flynn's &#34;The Last Man&#34; was his last book before his untimely death.  Fortunately, it's one of the best in the series.<br /><br />I thought the series struggled a bit some years back as the books became too preachy.  But this one keeps the politics out, but the bad assess, and bad guys, in.  CIA assassin Mitch Rapp was in full force in this one.<br /><br />&#34;The Last Man,&#34; which takes place in &#34;present day,&#34; (as opposed to the last few that were prequels), sees the very well-networked CIA operative Joe Rickman kidnapped in Afghanistan.  Because Rick (as he's known) knows so many state secrets, it's imperative that the CIA bring in the best to find him.  And of course, &#34;the best&#34; means Rapp.  But there are double-crosses everywhere and only the shrewd figure out what's real and what's not.<br /><br />Even when Flynn wasn't at his finest, his books were still good.  But when he was on top of his game, well, there was no one better.  RIP, Vince.<br /><br />SPOILER: Mitch gets knocked out by an explosion and goes through a period of amnesia.  This was quite interesting and I thought Flynn could have done a bit more with it.  But Rapp recovers in a pretty quick amount of time before he's off doing his thing again. I liked the idea of him struggling with the kind of person everyone tells him he is.  It would have been nice to see some change in him due to the injury.  Not that I didn't want him to still be a bad-ass, but still, it would have made an interesting twist.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|This movie just makes me feel better. I love English romances, and the acting was excellent! I totally recommend it!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Has it really been five years since the series started?  Have enjoyed them all.  Good cast of characters, good actors who play them & good writers.  Like the way the characters get along with each other.  Good television show!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I adore this movie! And the fact that it is a limited edition just makes it that much better! ♥
B000F8O35U|1.0|It was advertised as like new but was refurbished.  It struggled to play from the beginning and completely stopped working after a week.  Note I use my Xbox as a DVD player.  The disk seems to work in higher end DVD players but I do not have one.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Just plain fun! What more does a movie need to be? Matthew Broderick is hilarious. The supporting cast is equally delightful.
0800141660|5.0|The is one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters are as amazing as the story. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. I highly recommend it.
B00356CO1E|5.0|Before doing this workout I was going to the gym 5-6x a week doing 40 minutes of cardio.  I found it difficult and time consuming to incorporate strength training.  This video is great.  It takes a little over 20 minutes so you can squeeze it in before or after work.  I now go to the gym 4x week and do 30 minutes of cardio & this video 4x week. I think it is great to combine the two.  There is little cardio in the video so I recommend supplementing it on the side.  After a few weeks I've already noticed my arms are stronger.  You should definitely give it a try.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|I have never seen this movie before purchasing,  one of the reasons that I bought it was that it had Johnny Depp in it.  When it arrived I watched it at least 3 times in two days or so!!!!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Absloutely Awesome five stars all the way Thank you very much!!! Thank you very much!!! Pleasure doing business with you!!
B003Y059EK|4.0|I watched this movie many years ago and thought it was both depressing and weird compared to the Judy Garland movie but boy was I wrong. Since then I have read the Oz books and this movie is what the books are all about far more than the Judy Garland one. Dorothy is a little girl in this movie, true to the books, and not a teen like in the Hollywood Wizard of Oz. If you are a fan of the books this movie is a treasure. I like both versions of Oz by the way different as they may be.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Really made me think, and helped me overcome procrastination.<br />Love it and I thought it was fun to read as well
